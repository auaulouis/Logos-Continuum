## BMD Fails

### 2AC -- Tests Prove

#### Even if funding goes into BMD recent testing proves they are ineffective 

**Lockie, 18** -- (Alex Lockie- former news editor and a military and
foreign-policy blogger at Business Insider, \"US ballistic missile
defense just doesn\'t work --- but we keep spending billions and
billions on it\", 2-2-2018, Business Insider,
<https://www.businessinsider.com/us-ballistic-missile-defense-doesnt-work-but-we-spend-billions-on-it-2018-2)//mishelle>

The US tried and failed to intercept a missile on Wednesday, and also
announced it would spend another \$6.5 billion on missile defense
interceptors. The [US has spent more than \$40 billion on missile
defense projects over the last 15 years, and has no real credible
capability to show for it. Ballistic missile defense plays into the
complicated game of nuclear deterrence, which some say provides
theoretical protection, but **nobody can prove that**.]{.underline} The
US public learned on Wednesday that the [US Navy tried and failed for
the second time in a year to intercept a missile with an SM-III missile
from the defense]{.underline} contractor Raytheon. On the same day, the
Pentagon [announced it would spend another \$6.5 billion on 20 more
missile interceptors for the ground-based midcourse defense
system]{.underline} (GMD), which is meant to protect the US homeland
from missile attacks from North Korea or Russia. But the [GMD has a bad
track record]{.underline}. It recently had a successful test that may
have calmed the fears of some in the US amid nuclear tensions with North
Korea, [but a recent paper on the test shows it was unrealistically
generous]{.underline}. Laura Grego and David Wright, leading [experts in
the field of ballistic missiles]{.underline}, writing for the Union of
Concerned Scientists, [found that the so-called intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) the GMD knocked down was flown on a favorable
trajectory, slower than the real thing, and without any of the tricks or
savvy North Korea might use in an actual attack]{.underline}. The paper
concludes [the US has no reliable ballistic missile defense capability
for the homeland]{.underline}. That capability, or lack thereof, comes
after the [US has spent more than \$40 billion over the last decade in a
half on ballistic missile defense]{.underline}. During that time,
Boeing, Raytehon, and Lockheed Martin, key players in the BMD scene,
have all posted record profits --- and they continue to get contracts
with the Pentagon. To be clear[, the US can defend against some,
shorter-range missiles. Aegis-equipped ballistic missile destroyers at
sea have a good track record of defending themselves, but they\'re not
meant to go after ICBMs]{.underline}. Patriot missiles have saved some
lives from short-range missile attacks on the battlefield, though that
has been historically over-hyped or just lied about.

### 2AC -- Impossible

#### An improvement in missile defense still won't be effective- chances of nuclear weapons hitting are high and outweigh 

**Grego, 18** -- (Laura Grego- Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at MIT\'s
Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, on leave from the Union of
Concerned Scientists\' Global Security Program, where she is senior
scientist and research director, \"US Ground-based midcourse missile

Where dissuasion is concerned, many factors inform a country's decision
making about whether to develop ICBM technology, and at what cost. [But
a strategic missile defense system would have to be very effective to
alter an adversary's cost-to-benefit calculation.]{.underline} A
marginally effective missile defense system, or a system of unknown
effectiveness, may well create an incentive to build more, or more
sophisticated, missiles than states would otherwise build. **[No
evidence suggests that building or improving the GMD system has had or
will have any appreciable effect on potential adversaries' decisions to
develop long-range missiles.]{.underline}** The dramatic [increase in
tempo in North Korea's missile testing program happened after the GMD's
nominal deployment and development]{.underline}. Similarly, Iran has
continued to develop its long-range missile technology, launching four
small satellites into orbit between 2009 and 2015 and developing its
more capable Simorgh booster. What about deterrence? [The primary way a
missile defense system helps deter an attack is by creating uncertainty
in the adversary's mind about whether that attack would succeed in
achieving its goals]{.underline}. Under Cold War thinking[, if a peer
adversary such as the Soviet Union]{.underline} ([or Russia)
contemplated a carefully planned strike against hardened US military
targets, and if effective missile defenses existed, the adversary might
be uncertain how much of the US retaliatory force would remain intact
after the attack. According to this logic, missile defense would help
deter an adversary's nuclear first strike. The same logic does not apply
to an attack that a country such as North Korea, Iran, or even China
might consider]{.underline}. These countries' missile arsenals are too
small and [inaccurate to mount an effective counterforce strike on
hardened US military targets; they would necessarily target cities and
civilian infrastructure.]{.underline} Central in deterring North Korea
from launching nuclear weapons against the United States is the
certainty of a devastating US response. **[The presence or absence of US
missile defense has no meaningful effect on the deterrence already
afforded by US offensive nuclear and conventional forces.]{.underline}**
That brings the discussion to defense against a missile attack. While
North Korea's nuclear and missile tests of the last few years indicate
that Pyongyang is within reach of the ability to build a nuclear-armed
missile that can reach the United States, these missiles are and will
remain relatively inaccurate -- whether or not North Korea ceases its
test program[. North Korean missiles cannot be used to credibly threaten
hardened targets such as US nuclear command and control or missile
silos, and would instead be targeted on larger, less protected sites,
such as cities.]{.underline} For this reason[, the GMD system would need
to be very effective if it were to influence US decision making, as even
one nuclear-armed missile could devastate a city. Reliably defending
against an all-out assault is not feasible]{.underline}. While President
Trump stated on television17 last October that "We have missiles that
can knock out a missile in the air 97 percent of the time," testing data
show there is no basis for expecting interceptors to work more than 40
to 50 percent of the time, even under the easiest and most generous
conditions.18 Using multiple interceptors against each target can
improve these odds, [but this approach does not fundamentally change the
situation; the chance of a nuclear weapon getting through would still be
dangerously high]{.underline}. Consider an attack with five missiles.19
Using four interceptors against each target, each with a kill
probability of 50 percent, the odds that one warhead would get through
are 28 percent -- or higher, if the failure modes are not independent of
each other (for example, if the guidance systems of all the interceptors
are faulty in the same way). The odds may yet be worse if the adversary
uses numerous credible decoys that the GMD system cannot distinguish
from legitimate targets, and so must engage. Thus, while the GMD system
may provide some defense against the simplest threats, it cannot provide
the type of robust defense necessary to substantially change decision
making calculus.20

## Chinese Retaliation

#### Yes nuc retal !

Michael **O'Hanlon '19**, senior fellow at The Brookings Institution,
specializing in defense and foreign policy issues. *The Senkaku Paradox:
Risking Great Power War Over Small Stakes*, p. 49-50 //GBS

This somewhat sanguine conclusion is far from certain, however. It
hinges in part on a willingness in Washington to accept many thousands
of American battlefield dead and at least some risk of nuclear
escalation. Even though U.S. nuclear forces far exceed those of the PLA,
[**[China]{.mark}** might **[conclude that its disproportionate
interests]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline} issue
[**[warranted nuclear brinkmanship]{.mark}**, **[especially if
China]{.mark} had [already]{.mark}**]{.underline} possibly **[[lost
thousands]{.underline}]{.mark}** of its own people in conventional
combat, which would heighten the stakes as well as the reputational
importance of the outcome of the conflict. These [concerns could be
**[amplified if]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
intentionally or not, [began to **[strike the nuc]{.mark}lear asset[s of
the PLA]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the course of conventional fighting
near Taiwan. [If that happened, **[China]{.mark} might [face a "use them
or lose them" dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline}.101 **[[Nuclear
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** against a carrier, or a high-altitude
nuclear airburst over a base like Kadena (designed to destroy people and
equipment immediately below, without generating lots of fallout), [might
**[seem]{.mark}** particularly **[attractive]{.mark}** options **[to
Beijing]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### First strike causes retal -- "use it or lose it" dilemma, and planners favor offensive action

Finally, [**[inadvertent escalation]{.mark}** may [occur
**when**]{.mark} conventional [attacks put the **adversary's nuclear
force at risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under these conditions, the
[target state [might]{.mark} reasonably **[worry that the attack
is]{.mark}** only **[the first phase of a larger
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There may be [[no way to]{.mark} offer
credible [reassur]{.mark}ances [that it is not]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Fearing the]{.mark} destruction or [incapacitation of its nuclear
deterrent, the target state]{.mark} might [face a "**use it or lose
it**" dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Inadvertent [escalation]{.mark} is
[especially likely if]{.mark} **key [command and control]{.mark} nodes
are [vulnerable]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} if **[conventional and
nuclear]{.mark} target sets are
[indistinguishable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [danger also increases if
**[military]{.mark}** organizations **[indulge]{.mark}** organizational
[preferences for **offensive action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
encourages [[planners]{.mark} to **[err on the side of
attacking]{.mark}** all available targets]{.underline}. While it might
sense to allow the adversary to retain some capabilities in order to
reduce the incentives for escalation, [planners may [bridle at the
thought of]{.mark} consciously [allowing the enemy to retain the
capacity for attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.14

#### Laundry list of psychological factors.

strategy, and U.S. foreign policy. "Two kinds of catastrophe: nuclear
escalation and protracted war in Asia", Journal of strategic studies
Vol. 40, Issue 5, 2017, pp. 696-730 // gbs

The first is psychological. [**[Cognitive biases]{.mark}** may [cause
leaders to **misperceive rival intentions**]{.mark}, mistaking signals
of restraint for signs of danger. [Prewar expectations strongly
influence]{.mark} how individuals interpret new information, and [they
will **ignore**]{.mark} or reframe **[dissonant info]{.mark}rmation** so
it fits into their existing beliefs. Misperceptions intensify after the
shooting starts, when **information is [ambiguous and
incomplete]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Carl von Clausewitz dwelt on the
problem in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, noting that
intelligence reports were often contradictory and unreliable "in the
thick of fighting." [**[Despite advances]{.mark}** in intelligence and
communications, the **[fog of war remains an enduring
problem]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Organized violence is an iterative
process, and [**[each side has incentives to hide its actions]{.mark}**
and deceive its adversary]{.underline}. [**[Violence]{.mark}** also
**[unleashes intense emotions]{.mark}** that obscure the material
effects of battle. [Commanders]{.mark} may not understand whether they
are winning or losing, and in lieu of reliable intelligence they are
likely to **[let passion overtake good judgment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
"In short," Clausewitz concluded, "[**[most intel]{.mark}ligence [is
false]{.mark}**, and the effect of **[fear]{.mark}** is to **[multiply
lies]{.mark}** and inaccuracies]{.underline}." 9

[Wartime leaders are [prone to **attribution
bias**]{.mark},]{.underline} or the belief that their counterparts are
inherently evil. [[Leaders]{.mark} in conflict are **[likely to assume
the worst]{.mark}** about their rivals **[or]{.mark} else [they would
not have picked a fight in the first place]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Attribution bias causes them [**[disregard]{.mark}** the notion
**[that]{.mark}** their **[enemies]{.mark}** have limited goals and are
**[willing to accept partial victories]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They are
[also **[prone to reject peace overtures]{.mark}** as meaningless
gestures at best]{.underline}, or as efforts to lull them into passivity
before escalating the conflict.10 Finally, prospect theory tells us that
[individuals [will fight harder to avoid losing a possession]{.mark}
than they will to gain something new]{.underline}. [**[If leaders equate
settling with losing]{.mark}**, then [they will be **tempted to risk
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. All of these psychological pressures
are [[**exacerbated under stress** and]{.mark} tight **[time]{.mark}**
constraints.]{.underline}11

## Counterforce Fails

### 2AC -- General

#### The US has [fundamentally misunderstood]{.underline} Chinese nuclear strategy -- they have centered resources on establishing a [survivable nuclear arsenal]{.underline} rather than quantitative increases -- and they've [succeeded]{.underline}

**Brown 21** --- (Gerald C., \[Gerald C. Brown is an analyst with
Valiant Integrated Services focusing on nuclear deterrence and East
Asian security.\], "Understanding the Risks and Realities of China's
Nuclear Forces", Arms Control Association, 06-2021, Available Online at

mysoor)

[In its recent annual threat assessment, the U.S. intelligence community
described how [China is]{.mark} pursuing "the most rapid expansion and
platform diversification of its nuclear arsenal in its history" and [is
intending to "at least double]{.mark} the size of [its nuclear
stockpile]{.mark} during the next decade." Although deeply concerning,
this description should be put in context.]{.underline} The U.S.
Department of Defense estimates China's deployed nuclear forces to
number in the low 200s. Even if doubled, this is substantially lower
than the approximately 1,500 deployed strategic nuclear forces the
United States maintains on alert daily under the New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty. Despite the rising numbers, China seems unlikely to
quantitatively outpace U.S. nuclear forces in the foreseeable future.
[[Nevertheless]{.mark}, China's capabilities represent a substantial
threat that must not be ignored. [Quantitative comparisons]{.mark} of
nuclear arsenals [are]{.mark} [a]{.mark} relatively [crude manner of
understanding]{.mark} nuclear [risks]{.mark} and, in the case of the
U.S.-Chinese relationship, wholly insufficient. More than ever, **[U.S.
policymakers need to understand Chinese nuclear strategy]{.mark}**. In
the U.S.-Chinese context, policymakers should be more focused on how
conventional weapons and related strategies could impact the nuclear
calculus between the two countries.]{.underline} Chinese Nuclear
Strategy [[Unlike Russia and the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [China has]{.mark} found nuclear weapons to be of
rather limited utility in war-fighting. It [built]{.mark} what it
describes as [a]{.mark} "[lean]{.mark} and effective" nuclear
[deterrent]{.mark}, with the intentions of deterring a nuclear attack
and preventing nuclear coercion.1 Strategists in Beijing have long
thought that the destructive force of nuclear weapons limits their
utility, while conventional forces are more flexible and usable in
conflict. Conventional forces are thought to be where wars are won or
lost.2 In that sense, China's nuclear forces are intended to check U.S.
nuclear dominance while winning conventional conflicts at lower levels
of escalation. To make that happen, **China is seeking to build [a
nuclear force capable of surviving]{.mark} a nuclear [first strike and
retaliating]{.mark} with an unacceptable level of damage**. Experts have
perhaps best described China's nuclear strategy as one of "[assured
retaliation]{.mark}."3 [Instead of seeking parity]{.mark} with other
nuclear states [and]{.mark} being able to engage in
[counterforce]{.mark} campaigns, [China]{.mark} finds it sufficient to
[maintain a]{.mark} more [modest]{.mark}, secure, and [survivable
force]{.mark}. If China can sufficiently absorb a first strike and
retaliate, even with only a few warheads, Beijing believes an adversary
is unlikely to decide that the risk of attacking China is worth the
benefit.]{.underline} Since China's first nuclear test in 1964, it has
consistently maintained a public, declaratory no-first-use policy,
adhering to what it describes as a "self-defensive nuclear strategy"
that would anticipate using nuclear weapons only as a "counterattack in
self-defense."4 Western analysts have rightfully pointed out that a
no-first-use pledge may not be entirely credible on its own. Although
the pledge may be sincerely held, during a crisis, escalation could be
unpredictable. Additionally, a small number of Chinese analysts have
suggested that what China defines as a counterattack may be ambiguous
under certain, limited conditions, such as conventional attacks seeking
to neutralize China's nuclear forces.5 Despite Western doubts, the fact
remains that Chinese strategists believe that the pledge holds true. An
unambiguous no-first-use stance remains the official stance of the
Chinese government, and China's nuclear strategy is built around this
concept. Authoritative texts on Chinese military thinking have described
three major missions for Chinese nuclear forces. In peacetime, they seek
to deter enemies from launching a nuclear war with China. In wartime,
they constrain the scope of war, preventing a conventional conflict from
escalating to a nuclear exchange. If war does escalate to nuclear
conflict, they serve to conduct nuclear counterattacks.6 The texts
consistently describe only one envisioned use of nuclear weapons, the
nuclear counterattack operation, in response to a nuclear strike.7
Operational practices have reinforced this. Beijing maintains a highly
centralized nuclear warhead storage and handling system, with warheads
typically thought to be stored unmated from their delivery vehicles
rather than loaded and ready for launch.8 Further, training for nuclear
brigades reflects the practice of counterattacking under nuclear
conditions. Yet, there are indications of evolution. [Recent U.S.
government reports have suggested that some People's Liberation Army
Rocket Force (PLARF) brigades may spend time on higher alert and may
seek to shift to a launch-on-warning posture in the future **[in order
to increase survivability]{.mark}** under nuclear attack. **[China has
been developing a space-based early-warning system]{.mark}** with
assistance from Russia that could support this.9]{.underline} Nuclear
Force Projections As the U.S. annual threat assessment noted, there are
signs of recent substantial changes in Chinese nuclear forces. The most
important changes have been primarily qualitative, but notable
quantitative changes are also occurring. These are understandably
alarming to U.S. policymakers. Although the size of Chinese nuclear
forces may still be dwarfed by the U.S. arsenal, its growth represents a
substantial complication for the United States. Further, although the
United States and Russia are modernizing their arsenals, they have been
reducing their stockpiles over the past few decades slowly but
significantly. China's nuclear expansion represents a concerning shift
away from its obligations under the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to
reduce its arsenal, and that is likely to impact U.S. and Russian
decision-making. [Yet, understanding these changes in the context of
China's nuclear strategy is important**. [Instead of trying to reach
parity with]{.mark} or exceed [the U.S.]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}, [China seems intent on ensuring]{.mark} that [it
has]{.mark} an assured [retaliatory capability following U.S.
strikes]{.mark}.** Given U.S. nuclear and technological superiority,
China likely has never had a sufficiently survivable nuclear deterrent
against the United States, a goal that was more aspirational than
anything else. Revolutions in intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance technologies, coupled with advances in conventional
precision weapons, have long rendered China's nuclear forces vulnerable.
The U.S. ballistic missile defense program threatens to intercept any
surviving retaliatory force, further jeopardizing China's retaliatory
capability. **[For the first time]{.mark} in history, [the]{.mark}
People's Liberation Army ([PLA]{.mark}) seems to be [moving toward a
survivable nuclear force]{.mark} [capable of]{.mark} executing a [second
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Research suggests that [[Chinese
nuclear]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}s [and modernization]{.mark} are
oriented toward creation of a more mobile and redundant force that
**[can survive U.S. counterforce]{.mark} capabilities**, including
conventional systems such as the Conventional Prompt Global Strike
system, and its missiles being able to penetrate U.S. missile defense
systems.10 Consequently, although China's nuclear force size will
expand, it does not appear likely to expand to the size of the U.S.
nuclear arsenal in the near future.]{.underline} There is understandable
doubt about the claim of China doubling its nuclear arsenal, but it does
not appear to be out of the question. China is fielding an increasing
number of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle weapons,
such as the DF-5B deployed in 2015 and the recently deployed DF-5C and
DF-41, that improve the ability of China's intercontinental ballistic
missile (ICBM) arsenal to penetrate the U.S. missile defense system.11
Defense Department estimates do not appear to include the DF-41, which
is just starting to be deployed. Installing multiple warheads on these
weapons will quickly expand the number of nuclear weapons in China's
arsenal. Further, PLARF brigades have been increasing at an
unprecedented rate. The number of PLARF brigades reportedly increased
from 29 to 40 between 2017 and 2020, and brigades continue to be added
as new missile types are fielded.12 [[China's]{.mark} shift to a
[nuclear triad will]{.mark} further [increase]{.mark} the number of its
nuclear warheads as these new systems are equipped.]{.underline}
[**[China is creating a more survivable nuclear submarine
force]{.mark}**, expanding the number of Type 094 ballistic missile
submarines and developing the quieter Type 096 submarine with the JL-3
sea-launched ballistic missile as a complement. The PLA Air Force is
also adopting a nuclear mission by developing a new air-launched
ballistic missile that may be nuclear capable, as well as the
nuclear-capable H-20 strategic bomber.13]{.underline} Significantly, not
all of China's nuclear weapons are intercontinental forces capable of
striking targets located in the continental United States. China has
invested in nuclear weapons that specifically threaten the immediate
region. Its new air capabilities, along with recently deployed midrange
and intermediate-range ballistic missiles such as the DF-21E and the
DF-26, hold regional adversaries and U.S. overseas bases at risk. China
also recently deployed a new hypersonic glide vehicle, the DF-17, that
may be nuclear capable. Importantly, although China's nuclear expansion
may be oriented toward a strategy of assured retaliation, that does not
prevent Beijing from orienting its expanding nuclear capabilities toward
a more threatening posture in the future. As China's capabilities
expand, its operational doctrine may well follow suit.

Abstract[: A counterforce attack intends to disable an opponent's
nuclear arsenal to limit potential damage from that adversary. We
postulate a future when [harden- ing and deeply burying fixed
sites,]{.mark} transition to [mobile strategic systems]{.mark}, [and
improved defences]{.mark} **[make]{.mark} [execut- ing]{.mark} a
[counterforce]{.mark} strategy against an adversary's nuclear forces
[extremely difficult.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Additionally, our
postulated future has multiple nations possessing nuclear weapons.
Consequently, each country needs to consider multi- ple actors when
addressing the question of how to deter a potential adversary's nuclear
attack. We examine six nuclear targeting alternatives and consider how
to deter them. These strategies include nuclear demonstration,
conventional military targets, and attacks consisting of
communications/electronics, economic, infrastructure, and population
centers that a nation might consider strik- ing with nuclear weapons.
Since these alternative strikes require only a few nuclear weapons,
executing one of them would not significantly shift the balance of
nuclear forces. The attacking country's remaining nuclear forces may
inhibit the attacked country or its allies from respond- ing. How can
nations deter these limited nuclear attacks? Potentially, threatening
economic counter-strikes seems to be the best alternative. How might
escalation be con- trolled in the event of a limited attack? Other
instruments of power, such as political or economic, might be employed
to bolster deterrence against these types of nuclear strikes. 1
Introduction Nuclear deterrence is based on the threat of retaliation if
attacked (Lieber and Press 2017). Mazarr (1991) states 'one of the
crucial aspects of nuclear deterrence is a strategy for targeting a
retaliation to achieve the greatest deterrent effect.' Gray (2007)
concludes 'there has to be a nuclear strategy' indicating the intended
response to a nuclear strike to deter an adversary. The goal of
counterforce attacks is to disarm the adversary's nuclear forces. The
United States and the Soviet Union transitioned from targeting cities to
a coun- terforce strategy during the Cold War as weapon delivery
accuracy improved and weapon yields increased. Argu- ments for a
counterforce strategy include limiting nuclear retaliation by destroying
an adversary's offensive nuclear capabilities. Ewers (2016) contends,
'The United States should maintain a counterforce targeting strategy to
hold the nuclear forces at risk and provide restraint from esca- lation
with the peers and near-peers.' Additionally, attack- ing an adversary's
nuclear weapons is considered a more moral approach than targeting
cities. A common current nuclear approach contends that adversaries are
deterred from attacking a country with nuclear weapons because the
attacked country could respond with any of their surviving nuclear
weapons (Ewers 2016). In other words, if an adversary cannot execute a
counterforce strategy that completely cripples their target's nuclear
capabilities, they will not attack with nuclear weapons. **[This article
challenges the notion that a counterforce strategy, which targets an
adversary's nuclear capabilities, effectively deters all nuclear
attacks.]{.underline}** Consider a hypothetical situation where two
coun- tries each have over a thousand nuclear weapons. One country
attacks the other with a single nuclear weapon. Would the attacked
country strike back or be deterred by their adversary's remaining
arsenal? What if the nuclear attack caused significant economic damage
but didn't directly kill anyone? Would the attacked country strike back
against the other's population? If neither side can destroy the other
side's nuclear weapons, what types of targets might they attack? This
paper examines targets that do not fall under the current counterforce
strategy, not as advocates of these targets, but to ensure that all
types of nuclear attacks are deterred. Before discussing possible attack
and appropri- ate responses, [we first examine three trends which may
undermine a country's ability to execute a counterforce strategy,
improved weapon system survivability, enhanced defences, and expanded
proliferation]{.underline} (Gallagher and Sorice 2014). [**1.1
Survivability** [States with nuclear weapons]{.mark} [have
improved]{.mark} the [surviv- ability]{.mark} of their nuclear weapons
and associated delivery systems in case of an adversary attack, even
with nuclear weapons. The initial efforts [included reinforcing fixed
site]{.mark}s to withstand nuclear blasts. These efforts have [expanded
into]{.mark} creating **[deeply buried facilities.]{.mark}** Another
approach has been to [increase the mobility of strategic nuclear
delivery systems]{.mark}, thus [ensuring]{.mark} that **[they are
challenging to find and target]{.mark}**. For example, [aircraft]{.mark}
capable of delivering nuclear weapons have always been mobile targets
that could shift from one airfield to another to reduce the chance of
being destroyed. Additionally, land-based ballistic missile launchers
are being deployed on either [trucks or trains]{.mark} to make them
difficult to target. The sea-launched ballistic missile
[submarines]{.mark} have combined mobility and hardening; the
submarine's [strength to withstand water pressure is]{.mark} also
[effective]{.mark} pro- tection against nuclear blast overpressure and
dynamic pressure. Additionally, these submarines operate in the world's
largest thermal sink, which reduces their suscep- tible range to thermal
effects. Hence, **[submarines are not only challenging to find,
but]{.mark} they are [also highly resistant to nuclear weapon
effects]{.mark} should they be detected.**]{.underline} While decreasing
their nuclear forces in total numbers, the United States and Russia have
steadily increased the percentages of their nuclear forces that are
survivable through mobility. Lieber and Press (2017) and Long and Green
(2015) contend that improvements in intelligence technology will
eventually track and target current mobile delivery methods[; however,
[future sensing capabilities may be]{.mark} rapidly [overwhelmed with
decoys and other]{.mark} new [countermeasures]{.mark}. We also presume
that a country initiating a strike would expend their vulnerable weapons
and maintain their more survivable weapons in reserve. For this article,
**we postulate a future where hard- ening, mobility, deception, and
other means will con- tinue to make targeting an adversary's strategic
systems increasingly much more difficult. 1.2 Defences** [Nations
are]{.mark} also [increasing]{.mark} their [defences to reduce]{.mark}
any [adversary's ability to penetrate]{.mark} to their
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Defences are not new (Cimbala and
McDermott 2015). [Countries threatened by adversaries attacking with
bombers and cruise missiles have established [air defence
networks.]{.mark} For a while, stealth technology mitigated the advances
of air defences; however, the improved sophistication of integrated air
defence networks may [significantly reduce the ability]{.mark} of
bombers and cruise missiles [to penetrate]{.mark} to [targets]{.mark}.
Along with enhanced detection, the range of inter- ceptor missiles has
dramatically increased.]{.underline} Local area defences against
ballistic missiles have existed for decades. [[Recent trends]{.mark}
have [indicated an increase in]{.mark} the size of the defended area and
[the effective- ness of the interceptors]{.mark} (Lowther and Cimbala
2017). For example, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (2019) in the
2019 Missile Defense Review states, 'The United States is protected
against a limited ICBM \[inter-continental bal- listic missile\]
attack.']{.underline} One possible counter to improved defences is
faster penetrators, such as hypersonic weapons. A few weapons with such
advanced penetrative capabilities may even be able to assist in
deterring an attack from a country with an extensive defence network.
Zala (2019) concludes the 'new non-nuclear weapon technologies -- such
as bal- listic missile defense, anti-satellite weapons, and pre-
cision-strike missile technology -- will make nuclear deterrence
relationships that were once somewhat stable less so.' [**1.3
Proliferation [Proliferation is another challenge to a
counterforce]{.mark}** strat- egy (Mazarr 1995; Jo and Gartzke 2007).
During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union only had to
be concerned about the size of their arsenal relative to their single
adversary. Now, [each country must]{.mark} also [consider its nuclear
arsenal relative to all potential nuclear-armed adversaries]{.mark} and
coalitions. An extensive exchange between two countries might leave the
third country with the most remaining nuclear weapons (Kristensen and
Norris 2018).]{.underline} 1.4 Study assumptions For this discussion, we
postulate a future world where the following holds. Multiple states have
nuclear weapons[. **[No state]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[or coalition of
states [can execute a counterforce first strike that sufficiently
eliminates an adversary's nuclear weapons to not be concerned about
a]{.mark} nuclear [counter-strike]{.mark} in response.]{.underline}** No
countries have an effective global defence system, rendering all vulner-
able to strategic attacks. Each nation needs to consider multiple
adversaries. Contrary to our assumptions, Lieber and Press (2017)
contend that 'hardening and concealment---have been undercut by leaps in
weapons accuracy and a revolution in remote sensing' and further
'countries that have considerable resources can buck these trends and
keep their forces survivable, albeit with considerable cost and effort.'
In contrast, Mazarr (2007) states that the United States cannot achieve
any of its counterforce goals.

We stand on the cusp of a Third Nuclear Age. If this new era comes to
pass[, the main characteristics of **the global nuclear order**
are]{.underline} likely to see considerable challenge.1 This shift [is
being driven by the development of a suite of strategic **non-nuclear
weaponry**]{.underline} (SNNW)2 and enabling technologies, [in
conjunction with a fundamental political shift relating to perceptions
of nuclear threats]{.underline} and debates about how they should be
addressed. Together, [these trends **fundamentally
challenge**]{.underline} the canon of academic and [policy thinking
about nuclear weapons and **nuclear stability**,]{.underline} and mean
that [decision-makers must contemplate **new risks of** inadvertent
escalation, miscalculation, and nuclear use, and the possibility of
**counterforce missions**]{.underline} [unencumbered by]{.underline} the
political and moral restraints associated with [the nuclear
taboo.]{.underline}3 Essentially, [we are set to move from a global
nuclear order based on]{.underline} the assumption that developments in
[nuclear weapons]{.underline} are the primary driver of stability and
instability, [to one in which non-nuclear capabilities play
a]{.underline}n equally, if not **[more important role]{.underline}**.
Thus, the defining feature of the Third Nuclear Age will be that nuclear
geopolitics, risks, crises, deployments, postures, balances, arms
control, and non-proliferation will all be shaped as much by
developments in SNNW capabilities as by nuclear weapons.

We argue that a Third Nuclear Age will be a product of that which has
preceded it: Second Nuclear Age thinking about the benefits of deploying
SNNW combined with the return of the kind of major power competition
associated with the First Nuclear Age, is likely to make the Third
Nuclear Age a highly dangerous one. While [we may only be on the cusp of
this transition]{.underline} it could hardly be timelier to begin
thinking about the impact of these dynamics on the management of the
global nuclear order. This is important given that, as we argue further
below, [**there is nothing** preordained or
**irreversible**]{.underline} about the onset of a Third Nuclear Age.
This new era will be one of our own making.

This article builds on recent work by focusing on [the strategic
implications of the development of various SNNW]{.underline} systems
[and advances in sensing and reconnaissance]{.underline} but [makes a
more ambitious argument about the]{.underline} political and [strategic
impact of SNNW]{.underline}.4 We argue that five factors have been
either ignored or underappreciated in the existing literature: First,
while leading scholars have recognised the challenges posed by
individual SNNW[, the combination of these technologies and the
considerable influence on policy has been largely
overlooked]{.underline} in current analyses. Second, we go [beyond
recent arguments about nuclear counterforce]{.underline} options,5 to
suggest that the [**non-nuclear components** of these new capabilities
are as important]{.underline}, [if not **more important**]{.underline},
[than developments in nuclear forces]{.underline}. Third, while much
focus has rightly been placed on the United States, we suggest that [the
SNNW phenomenon]{.underline} is, or at least [will become, truly
global]{.underline} and is intrinsically tied-in with shifts in
polarity, regional dyads, and interstate power balances. Fourth, [the
impact is more far-reaching than a challenge to secure second-strike
nuclear forces]{.underline}, and instead will impact all aspects of the
global nuclear order. This is because the challenge is not simply
technological but is fundamentally co-constitutive with a change in how
decision-makers and analysts think about the management of nuclear
threats. Therefore, we should expect the politics of arms control and
multilateral cooperation on nuclear issues to play out in new ways.
Lastly, when it comes to the timing of the impacts of SNNW deployments,
we argue that perceptions of what may be developed or deployed, or
worst-case scenarios of how they might be used, are equally, if not more
important than the purpose or the capability of the systems deployed
today, when it comes to real-world policy impact.

### 2AC -- Dual Use

#### China's missile modernization means counterforce fails

Ian **Bowers '22**, Associate Professor at the Centre for Joint
Operations, Royal Danish Defence College. "Counterforce Dilemmas and the
Risk of Nuclear War in East Asia", Journal for Peace and Nuclear
Disarmament: Volume 5, 2022, pp. 6-23 // gbs

[**[China's]{.mark}** emphasis on **[rapid]{.mark}** and significant
**[improvements in its missile capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
driven by the strategic desire to hold at risk US and allied naval
forces throughout North and Southeast Asia. China's so-called
[anti-access/area-denial strategy seeks to deny the United States and
its allies the secure use of the sea and reduce their operating capacity
on land]{.underline} (Congressional Research Service 2022, 4).
Conceptually, this would [allow China to rapidly achieve military
objectives while holding off immediate efforts to counter
them]{.underline}. The range of these missile systems would include the
East and South China Seas (the first Island chain) and arguably extend
into the Western Pacific in the open seas between Japan and Guam. To
enact such a strategy, China must have the ability to overwhelm missile
defenses and still disrupt significant facilities such as airfields, C4
ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers \[C4\] Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance \[ISR\]) nodes, ports, and ships at sea.
The [People's Liberation Army]{.underline} Rocket Forces' (PLARF)
[conventional missile capabilities]{.underline}, therefore, [provide
Beijing with either a [**powerful tool to shape the operational
picture** should war break out or a **potent first-strike
capability**]{.mark} aimed at **[degrading the enemy's capabilities
before they can respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [China's]{.underline}
current phase of modernization seems to have [made substantial inroads
into **[undermining]{.mark}** traditional areas of **[US military
strength]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Numerous reports now suggest that
[China has attained the [capability to overwhelm US naval platforms and
facilities]{.mark} in Japan and the ROK,]{.underline} potentially
**[[destroying capabilities before they are
deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Shugart and Gonzalez 2017; Townshend,
Thomas-Noone, and Steward 2019). Targeting moving naval vessels is a
harder proposition. However, China now possesses [increasing numbers of
[advanced sensors]{.mark} capable of covering multiple
domains,]{.underline} including over-the-horizon radar and surveillance
satellites that, when networked with other capabilities and effective
data processing and analytics, [[provide **near-constant
coverage**]{.mark} of strategically important areas]{.underline} such as
the East and South China Seas and the Western Pacific (Bowers and
Kirchberger 2021, 629). China's military modernization over the
preceding 20 years has resulted in [rapid developments in its missile
and rocket capabilities]{.underline}. China reportedly possesses a
[**[potent array of]{.mark}** intercontinental]{.underline},
intermediate, medium, [and short-range ballistic missiles
alongside]{.underline} a large inventory of air-, sea-, and
ground-launched [cruise **[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One analysis
suggests that these [**[numbers]{.mark}** have **[risen
significantly]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the past fifteen years (US
Department of Defense 2019a, 47). Numerical growth is only one element
of China's missile modernization. Recently introduced capabilities
include [multiple and maneuverable terminal stages/warheads, deep
penetrating warheads, and increased accuracy]{.underline} (Jane's
Sentinel Security Assessment 2018). China's inventory of SRBMs
(short-range ballistic missiles) include the DF-11, DF-12, DF-15, and
DF-16 family of missiles, with ranges between 250 and 1000 km. These
missiles are capable of carrying multiple types of warheads, and
incremental developments indicate a focus on increased accuracy (later
models of the DF-11 and −15 may have a circular error probability of 50
m), maneuverability, and stealth (Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment
2018). The medium-range DF-21 series has also seen substantial
development since its introduction in 1991. The DF-21C introduced in
2006 reportedly possesses greater accuracy and greater range than the
original missile. The 1500-km range **[[DF-21D]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
an anti-ship ballistic missile that has attained some notoriety in US
defense and media circles, [gaining the moniker **"[carrier
killer]{.mark}"**]{.underline} due to its suspected mission of
**[[targeting US aircraft carriers]{.underline}]{.mark}** operating in
waters proximate to China (Missile Defense Project 2016). Similarly, the
DF26, which entered service in 2015, has a range of 3000-- 4000 km. It
is the first conventional Chinese missile to be able to target Guam and,
if deployed at Chinese facilities in the South China Sea, US facilities
in Australia (Gomez 2017). It has been reported that in the summer of
2020 China successfully tested the DF-21D and the ASBM variant DF-26B
against a moving target in the South China Sea (Kaziani 2020).
Importantly, the [**[DF-26]{.mark}** is **[capable of]{.mark}** both
**[nuclear]{.mark}** and conventional capabilities]{.underline}; some
analysis suggests that DF-26 units in the field have both warheads
available to them (Pollack and LaFoy 2020). Exactly why [China would do
this]{.underline} is impossible to fully explain. One possible reason is
[to hide the number of nuclear missiles that China has]{.underline}, in
a form of shell game. A second is protection: To reduce the risk of US
attack, [a dual capability puts doubt in the minds of opposition
tactical planners]{.underline} about the nature of the target and the
potential of uncontrolled escalation from conventional to nuclear war
(Pollack and LaFoy 2020). This would make a conventionally armed [DF-26
more [survivable in]{.mark} any conventional [war]{.mark}-fighting
scenario as **[targeting it would be fraught with]{.mark}** potential
**[risk]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

There are two ways to think of the nuclear revolution. One of them is
the simple destructiveness of a general war fought with ballistic
missiles and thermonuclear weapons. No one has put this better than
Daniel Deudney: In an age when the term "revolution" is used
indiscriminately, few have hesitated to use such language with full
seriousness to describe the impact of nuclear weapons upon the
state-centered world security order. This sense of the revolutionary
stems from certain awesome facts that are beyond controversy: nuclear
science and technology have given us the capability to wreak violence at
an unprecedented scale and speed. To find historical analogies for a
full-scale nuclear war one must look to great cataclysms like the Fall
of Rome, the Mongol Invasions, the Black Plague, the European Invasion
of the Americas, and the world wars and imagine several of them
occurring at once and greatly compressed in time, perhaps into a single
afternoon.1 [A general **nuclear war**,]{.underline} fought in the
all-out manner of other major wars like World War Two, [would not only
wreak this kind of destruction in]{.underline} days, if not
[hours;]{.underline} [it could also **eradicate human civilisation**
forever]{.underline} [and possibly even **kill every human** being and
most other forms of life on the planet.]{.underline} It hard to see how
anyone could deny that this constitutes a revolution, and the authors of
the book under review here, Keir [Lieber and]{.underline} Daryl
[Press]{.underline}, do not try to do that. It is the second way of
thinking about the nuclear revolution that comprises the real debate,
and this is how it has shaped the practice of international politics.
Earlier theorists, most notably Robert Jervis, argued that the prospect
of nuclear omnicide would discourage the world's states, and especially
those in possession of nuclear arsenals, from competing with one another
intensively. They would avoid serious security competition and war:
international politics at the greatpower level would settle into a
condition of stability and peace. This claim has led many scholars
interested in this second way of thinking to question how
'revolutionary' the nuclear revolution actually has been. During the
late Cold War, as Brendan Rittenhouse Green has clearly demonstrated in
a recent book, the United States abandoned the policy of Mutual Assured
Destruction (MAD) and sought nuclear superiority over the USSR,
apparently a plain disconfirmation of Jervis's theory.2 And in the
post-Cold War era, as the present authors under review argue, the U.S.
is pursuing new counterforce and defence systems with the evident aim of
achieving war-winning capability against nuclear rivals, such as Russia
and China. If the nuclear revolution has so radically transformed
international politics, these scholars [insist,]{.underline} why have
[nuclear powers]{.underline}, and [especially the United
States]{.underline}, [continued to engage in intense security
competition]{.underline} with their rivals [and sought to deploy
war-winning nuclear arsenals]{.underline}? It is an exceedingly
important question. In The Myth of the Nuclear Revolution, [Lieber and
Press]{.underline} develop a careful answer. Operating from the
structural realist assumption that states face a world of constant
danger and security competition with their major rivals, they [make two
overarching claims]{.underline}. [The first]{.underline} is that [the
development of nuclear missiles]{.underline} and thermonuclear bombs
during the Cold War [did not completely transform international
politics]{.underline}. To be sure, nuclear weapons make deterrence far
easier to achieve and the prospect of general war far more grim, but the
world has not changed as radically as proponents of the nuclear
revolution claim. [The second]{.underline}, as we have already noted, is
that in the post-Cold War era [new military technologies may soon enable
states]{.underline}, namely the US, [to wage nuclear war without
initiating a global apocalypse]{.underline}, either by using very small
nuclear weapons in a minor war, or [by launching a counterforce
attack]{.underline} against a larger rival that would eliminate its
ability to retaliate. We should note at the outset that we do not intend
to dispute the book's technical claims that the US may be on the verge
of developing such war-winning military capabilities, and therefore will
not be engaging with some of the book (parts of chapters 3--4) in any
detail. For the purposes of our argument, we concede this point. Rather,
we will deal with the book's two larger, if sometimes implicit, claims:
that the nuclear revolution has not transformed international politics;
and that for the first time, the United States can and should reject
nuclear stalemate and seek the ability to wage a winning nuclear war.
(1) The Myth of the Nuclear Revolution? In the first part of their book,
Lieber and Press make several points that seek to show that
international politics under the spectre of nuclear war is not all that
different from pre-nuclear eras. We have chosen three that are clearly
contestable, and will deal with each in turn. The first point deals with
problem of annihilation. As everyone agrees, [a nuclear war threatens
not simply to deliver defeat]{.underline} to an attacked nation **[but
to eradicate]{.underline}** it completely. While this might be debatable
with respect to continental-size nations like the US, Russia, or Canada,
it is not when it comes to compact countries like Japan, Great Britain,
or the Czech Republic. The British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan told
President Eisenhower at the height of the Berlin Ultimatum crisis in
1959 that ['eight bombs' would put an end to the United
Kingdom]{.underline}, and it is likely that in the event of a general
war the Soviet Union would have targeted Britain with many times that
number. Such an attack would have killed just about everyone in that
country and destroyed its political and economic institutions beyond
repair. [Is this not a revolutionary development]{.underline}? [Lieber
and Press maintain that is not]{.underline}: [nations at war have been
annihilated before]{.underline}. It was a common practice in the
classical world, most notoriously at [Melos and Carthage]{.underline};
during the Second World War the allies bombed Germany and Japan into
submission, and the Soviet Union ravaged its sector of Germany and other
states during the war's last days. 'Yet the possibility of suffering
such serious losses,' Lieber and Press state, 'did not deter the
combatants from going to war' (p. 13). This is not a convincing
argument. On one hand, the sacking of city-states of Carthage and Melos
was a political decision, made by leaders intent on punishing their
adversaries; other defeated states during the Greek and Roman empires
suffered far less, and had the leaders of these two city-states known
for sure what was coming they might have made different decisions. On
the other, while it is true that (west) Germany and Japan were viciously
attacked by their enemies during World War Two, it is equally true that
they were hardly annihilated and indeed prospering not long after 1945.
That would not have been the case with Great Britain after a general
nuclear attack. There is a larger point. [The difference between
annihilation in the pre-nuclear era and]{.underline} nuclear
annihilation [today is]{.underline} that the latter is a function of
**[the weaponry itself.]{.underline}** [Rome's brutalisation of Carthage
was]{.underline} not [about]{.underline} the weaponry the Romans
deployed but [their determination to eradicate a recalcitrant
enemy]{.underline}. The situation could not be more different [in a
putative nuclear war]{.underline}. Had the United States and the Soviet
Union gone to a general nuclear war, [they would have destroyed not
simply one another but allied states]{.underline}, like Poland or Italy,
[without necessarily having any interest]{.underline} whatsoever [in
punishing these]{.underline}, or indeed any nation's, populations. It
would be nothing other than an unavoidable consequence of a large-scale
nuclear war. This is a revolutionary development that distinguishes the
nuclear era from previous ones. A second point is one often used by
nuclear revolution sceptics, from many different sides of the debate:
that nuclear states have been attacked before. If Egypt and Syria were
so afraid of nuclear retaliation, why did they attack Israel? Argentina
sought to take the Falkland Islands from Great Britain, another nuclear
power. In late 1950, China entered the Korean War: its main adversary
was the United States. This demonstrates, Lieber and Press maintain,
that the fear of nuclear attack is not as powerful as revolution
advocates claim. This argument, made too often, simply does not speak to
the relevant claim made by nuclear revolution advocates: that nuclear
powers will not wage major war upon one another, for fear of unleashing
a conflagration that would kill not only themselves but trigger the kind
of apocalypse described by Deudney. Since the beginning of modern
international history, large powers have repeatedly attacked others with
the aim of defeating and conquering them. This happened twice in the
space of 30 years during the early twentieth century, but has not
happened, or even come very close to happening, since then. If the fear
of nuclear war explains this, as Lieber and Press seem to acknowledge
(p. 18), it also surely constitutes a revolutionary development in
international politics. The final point is perhaps the most important
one. This is the assertion that the pursuit of arms-racing and nuclear
superiority by major powers, though again primarily the United States,
demonstrates in itself the fallacy of the nuclear revolution. Lieber and
Press make their case clearly: We are seventy-five years into the
nuclear era, and nuclear-armed states are still competing as if they
lived in a pre-nuclear world. Could it really be that leaders are still
misperceiving the core strategic factors that allegedly define the
nuclear age (p. 5, italics in original)? This argument, echoing that
made by Green and others, assumes that when states make important
decisions, like building lots of nuclear weapons, and they do so
consistently over years, it must be rational and strategic. There are
two crucial problems with this assertion. On one hand, [in referring to
'nucleararmed states']{.underline} [it does not distinguish between
military planners and political decision-makers]{.underline}. [The U.S.
military developed plans to win nuclear war]{.underline} throughout the
Cold War. Yet [when the possibility of actual war loomed]{.underline},
for example during the Berlin and Cuban crises, [the United States made
major concessions to the USSR]{.underline} in order to avoid war,
[**despite** its massive **nuclear superiority**]{.underline} at that
time. After Cuba, American and Soviet leaders steered clear of direct
showdowns for the rest of the Cold War. They did so because they lived
in a nuclear world.3 If 'states' mean military bureaucracies, and not
their political leaders, then perhaps Lieber and Press's claim may be
true. But that is an odd way to define a state. On the other hand, [the
very claim that any policy adhered to over decades must be strategic
is]{.underline} also [debatable.]{.underline} The United States refused
to recognise communist China for thirty years, and there was no shortage
of supporters of this policy who defended it upon strategic grounds.
Then it abandoned that policy, and the isolation of China is now seen by
most historians as a mistake driven primarily by domestic politics. For
roughly twenty years, the US regarded the survival of South Vietnam as a
core national security interest, and it fought a ground war for a decade
to pursue this goal. American leaders repeatedly argued throughout this
period that staying in Vietnam was strategically rational and important.
Then the US abandoned South Vietnam, and the war is widely seen today as
an irrational disaster. These examples, and others that could be
mentioned,4 show that it is entirely plausible that a state might pursue
a particular policy, even for a long time, for reasons that turn out to
be not strategic and rational. As Dwight D. Eisenhower suggested sixty
years ago, this is particularly likely to occur when the policy relates
to basic issues of national security, and when it at the same time
provides employment, wealth, and influence to powerful leaders and
constituencies.5 We are not claiming here that the US decision to engage
in nuclear security competition during the late Cold War or in the
contemporary era must be attributed to the military-industrial complex,
and cannot have been driven by genuine strategic reasons. This is a very
difficult argument to prove. Rather, we contend that [the Lieber and
Press claim that consistent behaviour]{.underline} over the years
[demonstrates]{.underline}, eo ipso, [strategic rationality]{.underline}
**[is clearly disproven]{.underline}** [by many
counter-examples]{.underline} and appears to rule out by assertion other
explanations. It runs the risk of tautology. The Defensive Realist
Stability, and Offensive Realist Instability, of MAD On their way to
demonstrating the myth of nuclear revolution, Lieber and Press
investigate 'how much is enough' to preserve stalemate among
nucleararmed states. This they present as a technical question with
multiple parts. How many weapons with what specifications must survive a
first strike in order to guarantee devastating retaliation? How
survivable are the nation's secondstrike weapons? What degree of
survivability is sufficient to deter others' aggression? The authors
treat this question of how the quantity and quality of nuclear fire
power affects strategic stability as a technical question with two
extremes: 'even small, potentially vulnerable arsenals are enough,' or
'nuclear-armed countries \[must\] build truly survivable arsenals'
grounding 'assured retaliation' (32). They deviate from earlier studies
by analysing the impact of Soviet arms build up on US strategy, rather
than vice versa. Furthermore, they assess the efficacy of deterrence
under conditions of peace and war. They identify four US theories of
deterrence: existential deterrence, minimum deterrence, assured
retaliation, and assured destruction. They then provide a chronology of
the development of US strategic postures: 1945--1949, US nuclear
monopoly; 1950--1955, Soviet existential deterrent; 1956--1960, Soviet
minimum deterrent; 1962--1964, Soviet assured retaliation; 1965--1990,
mutual assured destruction. [Lieber and Press argue that despite
appearances to the contrary]{.underline}, including the fallacious
'Missile Gap' alarmism of the late 1950s, that US [defence analysts 'had
accurate intelligence]{.underline} assessments [of existing Soviet
strategic forces']{.underline} (49). The implication here is that it is
strictly a technical question of 'how much is enough.' [It is not a
question of policy choice]{.underline}, for example between whether
defensive realism (Robert Jervis) or offensive realism (John
Mearsheimer) provides a more efficacious security posture[. Lieber and
Press assume that US strategic intelligence is complete]{.underline},
[and that defence officials' response to that intelligence is fully
rational]{.underline}. They hold that assured retaliation and assured
destruction will both result in competitive security politics. In the
first case nations vie to achieve assured retaliatory capability, and to
deny it to others. In the second case, security competition is intense
because states will seek damage limitation capabilities as well as
greater offensive capability. Lieber and Press argue that during the
early Cold War, the US planned an overwhelming preemptive strike on the
Soviet Union were they to threaten attack (57--58). With increasing
nuclear parity between the two countries, the US had to settle for
assured retaliation in the 1960s. The US realized threats of initiating
general nuclear war were incredible because they were suicidal.
Therefore the US explored limited nuclear options to be integrated into
a flexible response and graduated war plan (53). Even in the 1960s, US
leaders upheld the goal of winning a war against the Soviets through a
'rapid nuclear disarming strike' (63). Counterforce weapons were
developed to challenge the Soviets' assured retaliatory power. Satisfied
that the US strategic response to the Soviets throughout the Cold War
demonstrates the instability of mutual deterrence via assured
retaliation or destruction, the authors move on to argue that security
competition in this dynamic, and unstable, equilibrium can be reversed.
As a step to making this argument they conclude there were defence
pessimists who endorse a strategic stance consistent with offensive
realism. These pessimists take two actions which Lieber and Press deem
rational: they endorse limited nuclear options to introduce into
conventional conflict; and they back this flexible response approach
with 'substantial nuclear capabilities' to achieve escalation dominance
(96, 104). Here they accurately discuss the US persistent rejection of
mutual assured destruction in favor of striving to achieve strategic
dominance. Yet they refer to the Cold War years 1965--1990 as
characterized by MAD (48). This is a curious, and telling, assertion.
The authors have argued that despite the existential condition of mutual
assured destruction, US defence pessimists, who controlled nuclear
policy by 1980, in fact treated nuclear war as winnable and developed
weapons capability and a strategic posture to support their aim. Lieber
and Press position themselves as neutral social scientists analysing the
US response to USSR nuclear weapons development to conclude that the
nuclear revolution is a myth. Intense security competition throughout
the Cold War, they argue, proves nuclear weapons do not offer nations
the promise of stable security, even given their acquisition of a secure
second-strike capability. Their evidence is the US response to Soviet
military innovations. Although they acknowledge the United States turn
to flexible response and limited nuclear options, they fail to recognize
or discuss the fifth nuclear strategy of preparing to fight and win a
nuclear war (p. 140, fn 4). Thus they fail to recount the intense
nuclear security debate within the US between proponents of assured
retaliation, and advocates of the war fighting school advocated by
Albert Wohlstetter, Herman Kahn, Colin Gray, and James R. Schlesinger
during the last three decades of the Cold War. Perceptions about the
precarity of MAD supported concrete bureaucratic steps to shift the US
strategic posture away from accepting the stalemate imposed by assured
destruction. James Schlesinger, Secretary of Defence under Richard
Nixon, was a chief architect of the war fighting stance. He played a
fundamental role in shifting Jimmy Carter's erstwhile support of the MAD
doctrine to that of the offensive countervailing posture with the
Commander in Chief's signature on Presidential Directive 59 in 1980.
This historical evidence, which Lieber and Press interestingly do not
mention, complicates their straightforward account that intense security
competition underneath mutual retaliatory capability refutes the concept
of nuclear revolution. This is not only because the US decision to
pursue a countervailing strategy in the 1970s belies their claim that
the period 1965--90 was defined by mutual assured destruction. Even more
important is the fact that this new strategy was not advocated as a
response to new Soviet technological and military capabilities, but
rather was a policy choice based upon political factors unrelated to the
nuclear balance. This undermines the authors' claim that the United
States declined to overturn MAD during the Cold War because of
technological limitations and the size of the Soviet arsenal.6 In the
end, their assessment of US nuclear policy during the Cold War is
unclear. Did the two Cold War superpowers engage in an intense security
competition during its last three decades under a condition of MAD, as
they state in the book and also in their famous 2006 article, 'The End
of MAD?'7 Or did the United States decide to pursue a war-winning
strategy in the late 1970s, which by definition entailed a rejection of
MAD and the associated logic of the nuclear revolution? And if the
latter answer is correct, why do they not discuss it at all in the book?
The question is not just an academic one. The United States found itself
after the end of the Cold War in a position of tremendous preponderance,
unprecedented in the history of modern international relations. Its
erstwhile rival, Russia, was in free fall after the USSR's collapse, and
China remained a modest military power. Other powerful states around the
world were allied with the US. But America could not translate its
preponderance into primacy, because both Russia and China retained their
second-strike nuclear arsenals, making it too dangerous not only to
invade either state but even to seriously coerce them. The obvious way
to overcome this problem, of course, is to develop a warwinning nuclear
policy for the post-Cold War world. And as Lieber and Press show better
than anyone else, the United States has gravitated toward this objective
over the past two decades with its acquisition of advanced new weaponry,
defence systems, and sensory and other counterforce technologies.
Supporters and critics of MAD alike all acknowledge that it only holds
if states possess invulnerable second-strike arsenals. If the United
States becomes able to eliminate that condition with technology, then
MAD does come to an end, as the two authors precisely argued in 2006.
The problem here, even more so than in the late 1970s, is that such a
policy cannot in any way be characterised as defensive. [Neither **China
nor Russia** possess or are seeking to possess a nuclear arsenal that
**could prevail** over the United States,]{.underline} so by [pursuing a
war-winning strategy the US would be clearly announcing its interest in
global primacy]{.underline}. [This would be a policy
choice]{.underline}, [not a response to Russian or Chinese
capabilities]{.underline}. Indeed, and [following Lieber and Press's own
reasoning]{.underline}, China's ongoing commitment to a basic nuclear
deterrent and Russian political and economic weakness means that [the
**conditions could not** be **more suitable for**]{.underline} [the
re-establishment]{.underline} of Schelling's and Jervis's defensive, and
[mutually stable, condition of **MAD.**]{.underline} If the United
States rejects that, it will be because it chose to do so, not because
it had no alternative. An implausible, almost surreal, disinclination to
acknowledge that the US is facing a strategic choice about what to do
about its nuclear policy, and that what it decides to do will be far
more important than anything else in affecting the policies of other
nations, pervades much of the book. In their conclusion Lieber and Press
state that a 'policy implication' of their analysis is that, 'in some
cases,' countries will work hard to create truly survivable retaliatory
forces, while their rivals will strive to hone counterforce capabilities
to keep those retaliatory forces vulnerable. For example, we expect that
China will continue to add significant nuclear capabilities (such as new
mobile missiles) to its arsenal, as well as bolster its
command-and-control capabilities---all part of a traditional path to
developing a secure, survivable second-strike force. In turn, the United
States will continue to modernize its nuclear arsenal and develop
offensive (e.g., long-range precision conventional strike systems) and
defensive (e.g. missile defence) means to counter Chinese retaliatory
capabilities.8 For example? IR scholarship has long been plagued by
prescription masquerading as description, but this passage takes the
cake. The United States is a preponderant unipole which at present
spends more on its military than the next ten or so nations combined. It
is the only state on earth which now, or in the foreseeable future,
could possibly 'hone counterforce capabilities' in order to make other
large states' 'retaliatory forces vulnerable', as everyone even vaguely
familiar with nuclear politics today knows. [The debate]{.underline} in
Washington [about what]{.underline} nuclear [posture the US should, not
'will,' adopt]{.underline}, a debate in which Lieber and Press
themselves have long been active participants, [is how determinedly the
US should pursue war-winning capabilities]{.underline} over other large
nuclear states.9 No other nation is having this debate or is even
capable of doing so. Moreover, everyone knows that [China's future
nuclear decisions]{.underline} [will be made entirely in response
to]{.underline} what [the United States]{.underline} does, because [if
the US develops the capability to 'counter' Chinese retaliatory
forces]{.underline}, [China will]{.underline} become vulnerable to US
predation, and it will surely [take the necessary steps to deal with
this threat]{.underline} that any Realist student of international
relations would expect.10 [Committing]{.underline} fully [to a
comprehensive war-winning strategy]{.underline} therefore [will not only
cost the US untold billions]{.underline} of dollars in new military
spending over the next years and decades; [it is also likely to trigger
an arms race]{.underline} and intense security competition [with
China]{.underline} that the latter state has signalled over decades it
[would prefer to avoid]{.underline}. Following [this dangerous course of
action is a policy choice the United States does not have to
make]{.underline}, particularly given the fiscal demands created by the
Covid-19 pandemic and the massive domestic programmes the new Biden
administration has embarked upon. This is precisely why the question is
so heavily debated in Washington. Lieber and Press have long made a
powerful case that new US technological capabilities threaten to
overturn MAD. However, their prediction of a policy outcome for which
they have long advocated damages the logical consistency of their
argument.

### 2AC -- Remote Sensing Fails

#### Tracking weapons is [impossible]{.underline}. Countermeasures, weather, and coverage gaps.

Based on this analysis, I offer some assessments and recommendations
surrounding the competition between TELs and remote-sensing. [Tracking
TELs requires the development of **critical technologies**]{.underline}.
[There are currently gaps where extant remotesensing systems are **not
capable of tracking** TELs]{.underline}, [namely at **night** and during
periods of **bad weather**]{.underline}. If a state wishes to develop
the capability to track TELs, they should focus their efforts on
technologies which address those gaps. Similarly, when evaluating
emerging remote-sensing technologies, the focus of analysis should be on
the technology's ability to close those gaps. Analysis of critical
technologies should focus on countermeasures. When evaluating the
potential effects of an emerging technology, analysis should focus not
only on the effectiveness of that technology, but also the existence,
effectiveness, and availability of the countermeasures. Broad endeavors
such as tracking are only as strong as their weakest link. Critical
technologies are a naturally attractive target for countermeasures as
they present a single point of failure. [SBR is **not a promising
means** of tracking TELs]{.underline}. While SBR has the elements of a
critical technology, and the ability to operate under conditions where
other deployed modalities do not have tracking capability, [SBR is
vulnerable to **simple countermeasures**]{.underline}. While some
countermeasures, such as RCSR with RAM, would require significant
research and development [effort, effective countermeasures such as
**decoys** are technologically simple and should be deployable at scale
for relatively low cost. Some countermeasures, such as **jammers** and
**ASAT weapons**, are already in deployment as they serve other
purposes, so SBR, if pursued, would be deployed into a hostile
environment.]{.underline} Electronic warfare and ASAT weapons also
present the risk of escalation through entanglement, [so states should
expect a **decrease in their security** if they choose to deploy an SBR
system with capability to track (permissive) TELs]{.underline}. Modest
SBR capability should not undermine strategic stability. One key finding
of this work is that a seeker's uncertainty in a TELs position grows
during gaps in coverage of sufficient length. [For the case of tracking
TELs, if shelters are kilometers apart, **regular gaps of length** on
the order of a few to ten minutes are sufficient to prevent
tracking]{.underline}. Concern has been raised in the literature that
the relatively modest collection of fewer than two dozen SBR satellites
deployed by countries around the world would be sufficient to undermine
the survivability of TELs \[9\]. Even if all deployed SBR satellites
were utilized as a cohesive constellation (it is unclear if this is
possible), there would be an average gap of more than twenty minutes
between overflights \[9\].7 [The U.S. collection of six SBR satellites
would present more than **90 minute gaps between
overflights**.]{.underline} [These gaps are sufficiently large that a
motivated hider could **easily exploit** them. The deployment of modest
numbers of SBR satellites (e.g. twenty to thirty) **should not
undermine** TEL survivability]{.underline} nor provoke escalatory
countermeasures on the grounds of TEL survivability. [Fears that
remote-sensing will inevitably undermine TEL survivability and damage
strategic stability are **overblown**. Tracking with remote-sensing is
potentially **more challenging** than is widely understood]{.underline}.
[In a game of hide-and-seek, the seeker does not contend with what that
hider does, but what they could do. The hider does not need to be
passive in the competition, as they can **actively interfere** with
remote-sensing through countermeasures. The hider also has the advantage
of being able to **be reactive**, they do not need to deploy
countermeasures until after the seeker has committed to **developing** a
**particular remote-sensing system**]{.underline}. That said, history
has shown that countermeasures can sometimes be hard to leverage, and
survivability can be undermined. Degradation of survivability is not
inevitable, however. Which way the balance will tip depends on the
specific technologies in question, and in the case of SBR, [the
advantage lays with **the hider**]{.underline}.

Stationary Jammer Arrays [[A jammer array]{.mark} is a collection of
jammers which are used to [collectively **deny radar
operations**]{.mark} in an area]{.underline}. Taking advantage of the
huge disparity in the 𝐽𝑆𝑅, [jammers can reach signal-equivalence at
**very modest** powers and gains]{.underline}. If attempting to jam
multiple satellites at once, jammers could be directed to cover the
entire upward facing 2𝜋 steradian. [More complicated arrays could use
[directed apertures]{.mark}, such as parabolic dish reflectors, to
**[directly illuminate]{.mark}** overflying
[satellites]{.mark}.]{.underline} These would be more complex and
costly, but would avoid inadvertently jamming other systems. A jammer
array could be conceived of on two scales, jamming a local area and
overcoming array adaptation. The more modest approach is to jam radar
operations in a local area. This could be accomplished by distributing a
number of low-power jammers in an area where the hider wishes to deny
the seeker the ability to observe.20 One possibility would be to mount
these jammers on shelters. If the shelter spacing 𝑠 is similar to or
less than the beam swath width, then this would prevent the seeker from
observing those shelters, or the avenues between them. The jammers could
be run continuously, or toggled[. If run continuously, the [area
spanned]{.mark} by the local jammer array [would be a **permanent
gap**]{.mark} **in coverage**.]{.underline} [In effect, this would
create a single distributed shelter where [the TEL could operate
**without**]{.mark} **risk of [being detected]{.mark}**, so long as the
jammers were operating]{.underline}. If [toggled, the [jammers could
be]{.mark} turned on when a TEL deployed to the local area, [kept on
for]{.mark} long enough for [the TEL to]{.mark} be able to [**move
anywhere**]{.mark} within the local jammer array area]{.underline}.21
The jammers could then be toggled off and the seeker would not know
which of the shelters covered by the jammer array housed the TEL. The
TEL could remain in that shelter throughout its patrol lifetime without
needing to move. This would change the dynamics of how the seeker's
uncertainty would accrue over time. Rather than organically accruing
over time, [the seeker's [**uncertainty** would **grow
linearly**]{.mark} with time proportional to TEL velocity from when the
jammer array was activated until the array was deactivated or the
boundary of the jammer array was reached.]{.underline} The hider would
have a strong incentive not to move after this point (so as not to risk
detection) so the uncertainty would not necessarily grow thereafter.
Utilizing a local jammer array, [[the hider]{.mark} has the ability to
[generate positional]{.mark} [uncertainty]{.mark} **effectively [on
demand]{.mark},**]{.underline} limited only by the costs of emplacing
the jammers, and the provocativeness of utilizing them (discussed
below). One such array would be needed for each TEL patrol to be
protected.

Mobile Jammers [The other method for employing jammers to shield the
movement of TELs is utilizing **[mobile jammers]{.mark}**. Mobile
jammers [are]{.mark} **already [part]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
**electronic-warfare [arsenal of Russia]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} includes the
Krashuka-4 mobile jammer system.]{.underline} [The U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) has assessed that Russian [mobile
jammers]{.mark} have the capability **to [deny SAR
observations]{.mark}** as well **interfere with satellite
communications** \[]{.underline}121\]. While mobile jammers could be
utilized to transiently set up a jammer array in an area, this would be
inefficient compared to a static jammer array (though more flexible).
For example, to create an area of uncertainty 10 shelters in extent
would require 10--61 mobile jammers for a linear or gridded road system,
respectively. A more efficient method for utilizing jammers would be in
exploiting their mobility. [A mobile jammer [creates a **moving blind
spot**]{.mark} for the seeker]{.underline}. [By moving a TEL alongside
the jammer, the hider can **[mask]{.mark} TEL
[movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To cover a shelter-to-shelter
movement, the jammer would need to approach the shelter containing a
TEL, and move with it to another shelter where the TEL could encamp. The
hider would be unable to determine if a TEL was present, or moved at
all. So, if a mobile jammer passed through any TEL's area of uncertainty
while operating its jammer, that TEL's possible positions would be
spread over every shelter the jammer subsequently passed

6.1.2 Shelter [[Spacing Shelters]{.mark} are an integral part of the
hider's ability to [keep **TELs undetected**]{.mark} for an **extended
period of time**]{.underline}. As noted in Chapter 4, [shelters are any
location in which a TEL **cannot be detected** [by
remote-sensing]{.mark} systems]{.underline}. This could be a natural
area, or a permanent or temporary structure.9 It is under the hider's
control how many, and how closely spaced these shelters are. Fixed
Shelters Fixed shelters are permanent or semi-permanent locations for
TELs to hide. [[Electromagnetic radiation]{.mark}, such as micro- and
radio-waves are [reflected by **conductive surfaces**,]{.mark} as
discussed in Chapter 2.]{.underline} [Dielectric substances, such as
[**wood** can]{.mark} also [**reflect or absorb** radio waves]{.mark} in
sufficient thickness.]{.underline} [[The hider could use a **number of
materials**]{.mark} to build shelters]{.underline}. [A simple material
for reflecting radiowaves is a **conductive metal mesh.**]{.underline}
The size of holes in a mesh determines if it is radar-reflective. Radio
waves are reflected by the metal of the mesh, but the holes in the mesh
act as waveguides which can allow radiation to pass through if it has a
high enough frequency. The cutoff frequency of a rectangular waveguide,
the lowest frequency that can travel through the waveguide, is 𝜔𝑐 = 𝑐
√︂(︁𝑛𝜋 𝑎 )︁2 + (︁𝑚𝜋 𝑏 )︁2 , (6.2) where 𝑐 is the speed of light, 𝑛 and 𝑚 are
mode numbers associated with the waveguide dimensions 𝑎 and 𝑏,
respectively, where 𝑎 ≥ 𝑏 The lowest frequency mode that is allowed is
the TE10 mode where 𝑛 = 1 and 𝑚 = 0. The cutoff frequency of a waveguide
is therefore

TEL-Shaped Decoy [An average RCS decoy is capable of deceiving SMTI,
which only measures the RCS distribution.]{.underline} SAR and ISAR
instead measure the spatial distribution of the scattering centers of
the target, which can be used to form an image. [An average [RCS decoy
can be constructed from]{.mark} a small number of **corner
[reflectors]{.mark}** while a [TEL-shaped decoy mimics]{.mark} not just
the sizes of the scattering centers, but also [their **spatial
distribution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the challenges of creating a
TEL-shaped decoy is that TELs are large objects[. [Decoys are]{.mark}
ideally **easily** and **[cheaply built]{.mark}**, so that many can be
used in conjunction (discussed in detail below).]{.underline} A shape
decoy must be able to approximate the physical size of a real TEL,
meaning that it will be on the order of tens of meters in length. The
challenges of creating a TEL-shaped decoy mirror those of shaping an
actual TEL for RCSR[. The same set of [radar reflective
materials]{.mark}, metal sheets or mesh can be used to control the RCS
of a decoy]{.underline}. In the case of TEL RCSR, the TEL itself is
large and can serve as a skeleton on which the outer radar reflective
skin can be mounted. [One possible decoy design would be to utilize an
**interior [scaffolding made]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **inexpensive** and
**[lightweight material]{.mark}** such as PVC tubing or aluminum struts
to form the scaffold over which a wire mesh could be stretched.
Integrating the mesh with a fabric or plastic liner, the same color as a
TEL would make the decoy difficult to identify with optical modalities,
in the case it was moved during the day.]{.underline}16 In order to make
such a simple decoy indistinguishable from an actual TEL, the same
procedure could be used on actual TELs, i.e. decoys are made more
convincing when used in conjunction with RCSR shaping. [[Making
the]{.mark} TEL [decoy mobile]{.mark} would allow the hider additional
modes for deceiving the seeker. Two simple methods for making a shape
decoy mobile are [**mounting it** on a smaller vehicle]{.mark} or on a
trailer]{.underline}. In both cases, the decoy needs to be made
lightweight enough that it can be carried by a vehicle such as one of
the TEL convoy support vehicles. A TEL sized decoy could be skinned with
60--180 kg of material.17 If scaffolding were constructed from aluminum
tubing, it could weigh on the order of a few hundred kilograms.18
Collectively, the decoy material would weight half a ton, approximately
the payload weight capacity of a half-ton pickup truck. Such a decoy
could be fabricated for roughly the cost of the pickup truck itself, on
the order of tens of thousands of dollars. A less expensive option would
be to mount the decoy on a trailer that could be towed by a security
vehicle. This would have the advantage of being able to be disconnected
and left in a shelter indefinitely.

Covered Roads [The hider can also create road segments that permanently
**cannot be observed** with radar systems by [creating **covered
road**s]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This effectively [reduces]{.mark} the
**inter-shelter [spacing]{.mark}** [to **zero**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[If a TEL enters a covered road section, after a time 𝐶/𝑣TEL where 𝐶 is
the length of the sheltered road segment, the seeker's [**uncertainty**
will **span the**]{.mark} **covered [segment]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
hider can deter an attack from an attacker with a risk tolerance of 𝑃𝑘
and 𝑛𝑤 available by building a covered roads totaling at most ∑︁ 𝑖 𝐶𝑖 ≤
𝑃𝑘𝑛𝑤2𝑟𝑤 , (6.4) of length, where 𝐶𝑖 is the length of the 𝑖the covered
segment and 𝑟𝑤 is the weapon effect radius. The equivalence holds if all
𝑛TEL are deployed within the covered segments, and the covered segments
are built in multiples of 𝑟𝑤. I will take this as the upper bound. [In
practice [the hider could keep TELs]{.mark} deployed **[outside of
the]{.mark} covered [roads]{.mark}** in addition to the covered
segments, and [force]{.mark} the seeker to allocate **[inefficient
numbers of warheads]{.mark}** [by building **covered segments**]{.mark}
of non-integer multiple lengths of 𝑟𝑤.]{.underline} [Covered roads could

radar-absorbing materials (**[RAM]{.mark}**) and **surface-shape

RAM operate by diminishing the magnitude of radar reflections by
coupling the incident field into a partially conductive, lossy medium
\[116\]. At a boundary between two media (such as air and a TEL), some
fraction of the incident energy will reflect off of the boundary and
some will transmit into the second medium. Figure 6-5 shows a schematic
of a wave approaching a boundary. At normal incidence, for a wave
traveling from medium 1 to medium 2, 𝑅 = 𝜂2 − 𝜂1 𝜂2 + 𝜂1 , 𝑇 = 2𝜂2 𝜂2 +

**lines-of-sight**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to a road segment as a function

maximum incidence angle (𝜃max) at which a TEL on a road segment is
visible is 𝜃max(𝛼) = 𝜋 2 − tan−1 \[︂ 𝑕𝑠𝑏 − 𝑕𝑚 𝑑𝑟(𝛼) \]︂ , (6.5) where 𝑕𝑠𝑏
is the height of the sight blocking structure, 𝑕𝑚 is the highest point
on the TEL which the seeker needs line-of-sight to, and 𝑑𝑟(𝛼) is the
distance to the sight blocking object from the center point of the TEL
as a function of the azimuthal angle from the heading of the TEL 𝛼.
Sight-blocking structures are most effective when they are tall, close
to the road, or both.

### 2AC -- Silos

#### New Chinese nuclear [silos destroy counterforce]{.underline} options

[**The [silos will significantly complicate counterforce]{.mark}
options. What can Washington do?** The Washington Post recently reported
that [over 100 missile silos have been]{.mark} [discovered]{.mark}
[being built]{.mark} in a desert near the city of Yumen [in
China]{.mark}. Chinese media have since claimed that the structures are
actually part of a wind farm, but the experts behind the Post piece
stand by their analysis. Analysts indicate that [these silos]{.mark}
will probably [house the newest]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic
missile ([ICBM]{.mark}) in the Chinese strategic nuclear arsenal, the
DF-41. This ICBM [can reach the continental]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, is solid-fueled, and is believed to eventually be a
replacement for the liquid-fueled, silo-based DF-5 ICBM. Estimates vary,
but the DF-41 is rumored to be able to carry anywhere from three to 10
nuclear warheads. This is a formidable strategic weapon seemingly
designed to be utilized as a component of a launch-on-warning policy
while deployed in hardened silos.]{.underline} What threat do these ICBM
silos pose for the United States and what should the U.S. do to counter
the threat? Let's start by putting ourselves in China's position. There
could be two primary reasons why President Xi Jinping has decided to
build over 100 new ICBM silos. These reasons are not mutually exclusive.
The first reason could simply be to adopt a launch-on-warning policy.
[This would mean most if not all the silos will probably be filled with
the DF-41 and **[China will utilize an early warning system to
detect]{.mark} an [enemy attack and respond by]{.mark} launching its
[ICBMs]{.mark} [before they can be destroyed]{.mark} in the silos.
Adding strength to this theory are reports that Russia has been
assisting China to build a ballistic missile early warning system. The
adoption of a [launch-on-warning]{.mark} policy would [increase the
survivability of]{.mark} China's [strategic nuclear weapons]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} bring them closer to the standard of the United States and
Russia. The second reason could be to [complicate U.S. counterforce
targeting]{.mark}, meaning the targeting of the enemy's military
infrastructure**]{.underline}. Under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(New START), the United States and Russia are each allowed to have 1,550
deployed strategic nuclear warheads. [The introduction of [over
100]{.mark} ICBM [silos]{.mark} [significantly adds to]{.mark} potential
[targets]{.mark} that [the U.S. must consider]{.mark} in planning for a
nuclear attack. In the event of a strategic nuclear conflict, it is
expected that at least two warheads would be utilized for hardened
counterforce targets, reducing the U.S. arsenal by over 200
weapons.]{.underline} A recent statement by the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs stressed the growth and advancement of the Russia-China
comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. While this is not
technically an alliance at this stage, it is highly plausible that the
cooperation between the two countries could include deliberately
complicating U.S. targeting plans and degrading the U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal. [In this scenario, the [Chinese silos could]{.mark}
collectively [contain just a handful]{.mark} of ICBMs. [The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would still be required to target
each]{.mark} silo, as there would be [no certainty]{.mark} regarding
which of the over 100 silos contained missiles.]{.underline} With the
element [of [having to allocate at least two
warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} [to ensure the destruction of hardened
targets]{.underline}, [it's evident that **[the U.S. arsenal will be
stretched thin]{.mark}** as it still needs to maintain a credible
deterrent against Russia]{.underline}. **[[It will be further stretched
if China decides to continue building]{.mark} ICBM
[silos]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One can see how this is an effective
strategy designed to complicate a U.S. strategic response. So, what can
the United States do about it? [It's critical that [the U.S]{.mark}.
builds and [maintains a robust nuclear warfighting capability]{.mark}.
With an effective triad of air, sea, and land based strategic nuclear
weapons, the United States is illustrating that it has options available
for different contingencies. Added to this capability are tactical
nuclear weapons based in Europe and the introduction of the low-yield
submarine-launched ballistic missile deployed on the Ohio-class
ballistic missile submarines. [As diverse as this force is]{.mark},
**[it still does not]{.mark} adequately [deal with the addition of
Chinese silos due]{.mark} to New START limitations**]{.underline}. A
possible option is the introduction and deployment of land based nuclear
medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles within range of Chinese
strategic weapons. These could be positioned in countries willing to
accept them and due to the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019, the quantity deployed would not be subject
to restrictions. The deployment of INF range nuclear weapons would
resolve the issue of stretching the U.S. strategic arsenal thin. A step
forward for the Biden administration would be to publicly commence
negotiations with countries willing to house these weapons while keeping
the door open to China for a diplomatic solution. The potential threat
of being surrounded by U.S.-controlled INF range weapons could result in
China re-thinking its opposition to entering into New START negotiations
with the United States and Russia. If nothing is done to counter China's
rapid nuclear weapons increase, we could see hundreds more ICBM silos
being built, rendering the U.S. strategic arsenal inadequate to deal
with multiple threats in addition to fulfilling its extended deterrence
role to allies including South Korea, Japan, and Australia. China and
Russia have demonstrated that they are united in reducing the influence
and power of the United States in order to achieve their own strategic
goals. A future strategic nuclear alliance between China and Russia is
not a fantasy. China has the technological and economic capability to
continue modernizing and increasing the size of its nuclear forces
exponentially. While it is seemingly lagging behind in an effective
ballistic missile early warning system and ballistic missile submarines,
it already possesses a robust nuclear force including INF range weapons
and mobile ICBM launchers. It will not take China long to bridge the gap
and the United States may find itself dangerously outnumbered against
two major nuclear powers. The Biden administration needs to proactively
deal with this now because **[[China is steamrolling ahead]{.mark} to
catch up.]{.underline}**

Word has it that **[China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) has
staged a breakthrough in submarine propulsion.]{.underline}** Here\'s
What You Need To Remember: [[The PLA Navy]{.mark} may be [poised to
overcome a tech]{.mark}nological and tactical [defect]{.mark} that has
plagued it since its founding. Word has it that China's People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) has staged a breakthrough in submarine
propulsion. At any rate, that's the word from marine engineer Rear
Admiral Ma Weiming, a specialist in electromagnetic systems. Admiral Ma
recently reported on state-run CCTV that shipwrights are installing
shaftless rim-driven pumpjets in [China's]{.mark} "next-generation
[nuclear submarines]{.mark}," meaning attack or ballistic-missile boats.
(Click here for a layman's description of pumpjet technology.) Ma crowed
that Chinese engineers **[are "now way ahead of the United
States]{.mark}**, which has also been developing similar
technology."]{.underline} If Admiral Ma is playing it straight---rather
than hyping promising but yet-to-be-proven gadgetry---then the PLA Navy
is poised to overcome a technological and tactical defect that has
plagued it since its founding. [[American submariners long
lampooned]{.mark} Soviet and [Chinese nuclear boats for being]{.mark}
noisy [and easy to detect]{.mark}. PLA Navy boats remained backward long
after the Cold War. **Ultraquiet propulsion**, though, [would put an end
to]{.mark} unquestioned [U.S. acoustic supremacy]{.mark},
[opening]{.mark} up [new]{.mark} operational and strategic
[vistas]{.mark} be[for]{.mark}e [the PLA Navy]{.mark} while
[ushering]{.mark} in [a deadlier phase of U.S.-China]{.mark} strategic
[comp]{.mark}etition.]{.underline} The rim-driven pumpjet is an
electrically driven "propulsor" that simplifies and thus quiets an
engineering plant. Older technology typically uses gears to connect the
elements of a drive train. Steam spins the innards of high-speed
turbines. Turbines spin far too fast for any main propulsion shaft or
propeller, however, so ships outfitted with traditional engineering
plants have "main reduction gears" that step down the speed of rotation
drastically, to speeds useful for the shaft that turns the screw and
impels the hull through the water. Gears are noisemakers. Pumpjet
technology dispenses with them, simplifying and silencing plant
operations. [The design also reduces cavitation---bubbles churned up
when a propeller turns rapidly underwater, leaving low-pressure zones
behind the blades where water can boil. Cavitation emits noise that
enemy sonar operators may hear. Thus it can alert hostile
anti-submarine-warfare (ASW) forces, helping them find, track and target
the emitter. Hence the allure of novel technology that suppresses
cavitation.]{.underline} Now, there are ample grounds for skepticism
toward Admiral Ma's claims. New technology remains a hypothesis until
tested out in real-world operations. But at the same time it's doubtful
Ma was simply showboating for Chinese TV viewers. Rising competitors
have caught up with established navies before, or even leapfrogged them
in certain areas. [[The Imperial Japanese]{.mark} Navy [defied
expectations]{.mark}, devising the Long Lance torpedo that it deployed
to devastating effect [at Pearl Harbor]{.mark}. [The Soviet Navy]{.mark}
concocted antiship missiles and torpedoes that give the U.S. Navy fits
to this day. Thus it behooves us to ask what if: [what if China pulls
off a tech]{.mark}nological [leap of similar
magnitude]{.mark}?]{.underline} Set aside the question of whose
submarines are quieter than whose. Boastfulness---the urge to be the
biggest, best and most of everything, and to have others acknowledge
it---forms a strand in China's cultural DNA. Ma is indulging in it. But
no one is going to hold a contest to measure noise given off by U.S.
Navy and PLA Navy boats, and award victory to the quietest fleet. Combat
is the true arbiter of military effectiveness---and undersea combat
hinges on whether "hiders" or "finders" prevail. It pits a sub's
capacity for silent running against the acuity of ASW sensors and
operators trying to ferret it out. In other words, if American hiders
remain quiet enough to evade Chinese finders, they hold the advantage of
stealth. If acoustics has befriended the PLA Navy, then American finders
have a problem. And if both submarine services can elude ASW hunters,
then both they and surface fleets are in dire peril. "Peer" submarines
could engage one another at close proximity in the deep, or strike
against surface vessels without warning. Indeed, the surface of
embattled oceans could verge on no-go territory. That prospect makes
this thought experiment about the future of subsurface warfare
worthwhile. Suppose rim-driven pumpjet propulsors do pan out for China's
navy. How might commanders use newly elusive boats? First of all, they
might afford nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs, known
to U.S. submariners as "boomers") precedence when installing newfangled
propulsion hardware. The PLA Navy already operates a sizable fleet of
diesel-electric attack subs that satisfices for antiaccess/area-denial
purposes. They can make shift until silent-running nuclear-powered
attack subs (SSNs) join the fleet. SSNs can wait. By contrast, the navy
stands at the brink of fielding its first effective SSBNs. Fabricating a
new capability would seem to take precedence over improving an old but
adequate one---especially if the nation's nuclear deterrent depends on
the new capability. If this logic prevails, how will the PLA Navy employ
working boomers? To all appearances, it envisions employing the South
China Sea as an offshore "bastion" for SSBNs, much as the Soviet Navy of
yesteryear made semienclosed waters into protected bastions for its
missile boats. Undersea deterrence, then, probably numbers among the
motives impelling the PLA to transform rocks and atolls into fortified
outposts, acquaint itself with underwater hydrography, and so forth.
China's Type 094 SSBNs or their pumpjet-equipped descendants could slip
out of the sub base on Hainan Island, descend into South China Sea
waters, lose themselves in the depths and dare rival navies to come into
China's "near seas"---expanses that fall under the shadow of land-based
PLA missiles and aircraft---to hunt them. Or if Chinese Communist Party
leaders feel comfortable granting SSBN skippers the liberty to venture
outside the near seas (though that's a lot of atomic firepower to
entrust to a naval officer whose loyalties might prove suspect), the
Luzon Strait affords a convenient entryway to the western Pacific.
Within the strait lies the Bashi Channel, a deep underwater thoroughfare
into the Pacific. The weather between Luzon and the southern tip of
Taiwan often works against airborne ASW; subs transiting the channel can
conceal their whereabouts by diving beneath thermal layers that play
tricks with sound. An ultraquiet SSBN, in short, could thrive in South
China Sea patrol grounds---and beyond. Second, PLA Navy commanders
doubtless salivate at the prospect of ultraquiet attack boats. They
could merge new SSNs---presumably the Type 095s under development---into
their antiaccess defenses against the U.S. Pacific Fleet. They could
package new with old units inventively. For example, they could station
a picket line of diesel boats and older Type 093 SSNs along likely axes
of approach from Hawaii or U.S. West Coast seaports. Speedy but quiet
Type 095s could act as "skirmishers," operating forward of the pickets.
SSNs could snipe at the Pacific Fleet's flanks during its westward
voyage while scouting for the rest of the fleet, and for shore-based PLA
defenders. They could mount piecemeal attacks against the American
fleet, or even try to herd it toward the picket line for additional
punishment. PLA commanders thus could use ultramodern platforms to wring
new value out of legacy platforms. Such an approach would harness the
latest technology while staying true to China's Maoist tradition of
"active defense." Active defense---which, as Chinese military folk
remind us, remains the "essence" of Chinese military strategy decades
after Mao Zedong's demise---envisions luring foes deep into Chinese-held
territory. PLA defenders stage tactical actions to weary enemies as they
come. They fall on isolated units and try to smash them. Successive
small-scale attacks enfeeble enemy forces, setting the stage for
decisive battle on Chinese ground. Think about the options that may
become available to Chinese skippers as propulsor technology matures.
Diesel boats could act as western Pacific pickets, or congregate in
wolfpacks to concentrate firepower from multiple axes. Relatively noisy
Type 093s could act as decoys, distracting American ASW hunters while
Type 095s spring ambushes at opportune moments. And on and on.
Commanders could combine and recombine forces in limitless ways---in
keeping with China's way of war. Call it undersea active defense. Third,
the advent of quiet-running SSNs would let the PLA Navy play
submarine-on-submarine games reminiscent of those once played by U.S.
and Soviet boats. To date, lacking a peer to U.S. Navy Los Angeles-- or
Virginia-class SSNs, the PLA Navy has employed its submarine fleet
mainly as an antisurface force. It waits offshore for hostile forces to
approach, then does its best to pummel them with missiles or torpedoes.
American submariners, by contrast, will tell you the best ASW weapon is
another submarine. They view hunting subs as their chief contribution to
high-seas warfare. Chinese submariners might follow suit if their boats
ran quiet enough, and boasted sensors sensitive enough, to make
sub-on-sub ASW an option. Or they might incorporate ASW into their
operational portfolio while retaining the emphasis on antiship missions.
[Either way, [PLA sub]{.mark}marine [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [would
take on an intensely offensive]{.mark} hue. No longer would the sub
force be a mostly static force lofting antiship missiles toward
adversary surface task forces. It [would seek out adversary sub]{.mark}s
as well---and, if successful, project China's antiaccess defenses into
the depths in a serious way for the first time[. No longer could the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' silent service [prowl Asian
waters]{.mark} with impunity. Indeed[, if both fleets were
comparable]{.mark} in stealth, cat-and-mouse games might predominate.
[This would be]{.mark} a [dangerous]{.mark} business. Reaction times
would be minimal if boats could only detect and track one another at
intimate range. Proximity would magnify the prospect of collisions,
[accidents]{.mark} of other types, or even [inadvertent
exchanges]{.mark} of fire. Both navies and their political masters must
think ahead about how to manage close-quarters encounters in the
deep.]{.underline} And fourth, the debut of pumpjet-equipped SSNs would
empower Beijing to mount a standing presence in faraway recesses of the
South China Sea and Indian Ocean for the first time. Diesel boats have
ventured into the "far seas" in recent years, but they must put into
port at regular intervals to refuel. This exposes them to detection.
SSNs can remain at sea, and undersea, as long as their food and stores
hold out. The crew---not the engineering plant---thus constitutes the
limiting factor on a nuclear-powered boat's at-sea endurance. The Indian
Navy has taken notice of PLA Navy forays into India's home region, and
grasps the implications of high-tech Chinese SSNs cruising the Indian
Ocean. Indeed, some Indian mariners deem such a presence a red line for
competition between the two navies. It can be no accident, then, that
there's an antisubmarine flair to this summer's Malabar exercises among
the Indian Navy, U.S. Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. All
three navies dispatched aircraft carriers for maneuvers for the first
time. The Japanese flattop JS Izumo is a euphemistically dubbed
"helicopter destroyer" optimized for hunting submarines. What hostile
subs may lurk in the Bay of Bengal, where the exercises are underway,
apart from China's? Hider-finder competition, it seems, has come to the
Indian Ocean. Does new engineering technology herald an age of Chinese
maritime supremacy? Of course not. Carl von Clausewitz portrays martial
strife as constant struggle between "wrestlers" striving to "throw" each
other for strategic gain. That goes for acoustic one-upmanship as well.
One contender innovates; the other resolves to outdo it. It appears,
consequently, that more equal undersea competition lies in store. [To
prepare for it, U.S. [Navy]{.mark} submariners [must learn to think
of]{.mark} [PLA]{.mark} Navy [subs]{.mark} not as prey to be devoured by
American predators but [as worthy foes]{.mark}, [capable of]{.mark} some
[sub hunting]{.mark} of their own. The silent service must adjust to the
new, old reality of peer competition beneath the waves. **[The game's
afoot.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

as part of a quasi-alliance that seeks to enforce a \"free and open
Indo-Pacific.\" And countries as far away as Germany, Norway and the
United Kingdom have also purchased the aircraft. One senior Pentagon
intelligence official said it\'s no coincidence that countries were
buying up the anti-submarine warfare platform. \"China is expanding
their undersea warfare capability to extend beyond the South China Sea,
which presents a strategic threat to not only nations with territorial
disputes, but throughout the entire Pacific area,\" the official told
Newsweek. \"It is essential for the national security of partner nations
to have the ability to detect and monitor Chinese submarines. The P-8
Poseidon is the best capability to perform that task.\" \"With an
advanced anti-submarine warfare suite,\" the official added, \"the P-8
is the best answer to countering Chinese submarines.\" A spokesperson
for Boeing, the U.S. aerospace company that produces the P-8 and its
submarine-fighting P-8A variant, said the aircraft was \"deployed around
the world, with more than 135 aircraft in service, and over 400,000

to multiply[, present]{.mark}ing [a formidable competitor]{.mark} as
tensions simmer across the seas of Asia.]{.underline} The U.S.
military\'s latest assessment of Chinese military power, published in

submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and four
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. [The U.S. is estimated to
possess roughly 68 submarines, all nuclear-powered, but **[China\'s
fleet is expanding rapidly]{.mark}**. The report described **[submarine
development as a \"high priority\"]{.mark}** for the People\'s
Liberation Army Navy, and estimated that the force \"will likely
maintain between 65 and 70 submarines through the 2020s, replacing older
units with more capable units on a near one-to-one basis.\"]{.underline}
China has set out to update two key submarine models, the Xia-class Type
092 and the Jin-class Type 094, according to a report published last
month by French submarine expert Eric Genevelle and retired U.S. Navy
submarine sonar technician Richard W. Stirn. [This campaign includes
[vessels equipped with nuclear-capable]{.mark} submarine-launched
ballistic missiles ([SLBMs]{.mark}), as well as an array of other
weapons such as anti-ship missiles and torpedos. The latest Chinese
SLBM, known as JL-2A, has a range of nearly 8,600 kilometers, more than
5,340 miles, **[putting potential targets as far as the U.S. mainland
within range]{.mark}**, as estimated in Genevelle and Stirn\'s

strategic function. **[[These quiet undersea craft traverse the
depths]{.mark} largely [undetected]{.mark}, making them ideal for
gathering intelligence as they conduct missions as far out as the Indian
Ocean.]{.underline}** They also can serve to fortify Beijing\'s broad
territorial claims across geopolitically sensitive spots in the South
China Sea and East China Sea, where Japan last month sent both warplanes
and warships in response to a suspected Chinese submarine spotted too
close for Tokyo\'s comfort to islands claimed by both countries. With
the U.S. and partnered nations seeking to challenge China\'s version of
the world map, the People\'s Republic views submarines as a key asset.

the [risk that a similar mishap]{.mark} --- perhaps involving a U.S.

United States and China.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Experts say the danger
is growing as Beijing aggressively advances its territorial claims in
the South and East China seas while Western nations counter with a
growing number of naval passages designed to support freedom of
navigation through the contested waters. The stakes were further raised
last month with the announcement of the new AUKUS alliance among the
United States, Britain and Australia, which will provide Australia with
10 new nuclear-powered submarines. In the latest incident, a U.S.
nuclear-powered submarine hit an unknown underwater object on October 2,
the U.S. Navy\'s Pacific Fleet said in a news release. The Navy said
crewmembers aboard its Seawolf-class submarine USS Connecticut were
hurt, though no one\'s life was threatened, and that it is investigating
what happened. **[But an analysis published on the Chinese
state-controlled CGTN news website said last week that [the]{.mark} U.S.
[use of nuclear submarines]{.mark} to \"secretly infringe on China\'s
maritime territory in the South China Sea [runs the risk of triggering a
war between the]{.mark}se [two major powers by

only one who is worried. [Other experts tell VOA they fear that a more
serious incident between China and a U.S. treaty ally such as Japan or
the Philippines could, under certain circumstances, trigger a severe
response from Washington.]{.underline} The exact U.S. recourse would
depend on the details of the actual incident, said Scott Harold,
Washington-based senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation
research organization. [\"[Is a bump an attack or does it have to result
in]{.mark} an injury or an actual [death]{.mark} or a sinking?\" Harold
asked. \"I think those would be areas where [U.S. policymakers]{.mark}

very quickly trying to assess]{.mark} what is the intention, what is the
threshold, is the host nation --- meaning the third-party Japan or the
Philippines --- is it able to respond without the United
States?\"]{.underline} The U.S. Indo Pacific Command in Hawaii did not
answer requests for comment on the risk of accidents near China.
China\'s neighbors, US alliances China calls about 90% of the South
China Sea its own despite competing claims from the Philippines and
three other Southeast Asian countries that are sympathetic to the West.
Beijing claims all of Taiwan, a self-ruled island that\'s supported by
Washington, and vies with Japan for control over parts of the East China
Sea. Successive U.S. presidents have seen their Asian allies as buffers
against China in any showdown between superpowers. Treaties obligate
Washington to consider helping its allies in military crises. Increasing
numbers of Chinese military flights near Taiwan, where the island\'s air
force sometimes chases the planes away, is raising the specter of a
mishap now, analysts believe. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act gives
Washington the option of intervening on Taipei\'s behalf. \"How long do
you keep poking your fist in Taiwan\'s face before you miscalculate at
one point?\" asked Carl Thayer, emeritus professor of politics at the
University of New South Wales in Australia. \"The aircraft could cross a
line, or Taiwan\'s air defenses, which have been turned on and locked
onto some of these flights as a warning, could lead to firing
missiles.\" News reports this month saying the United States has
stationed troops in Taiwan for at least a year could prompt an angry
China to send more planes toward the island, said Oh Ei Sun, senior
fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. The
Philippines, for its part, might risk an accident with Chinese vessels
even if warned against it by the United States, Oh said. The 2022
Philippine presidential race could be a trigger point, he added, if
Sino-Philippine relations become a campaign issue. Vessels from China
and the Philippines got into a protracted standoff in 2012 over
Scarborough Shoal, a fisheries-rich feature that each side claims as its
own. \"I think the Filipinos, they are very independent minded, and when
something happened, the U.S. may be obligated by treaty obligation to
come to their rescue,\" Oh said. A miscalculation involving China and
Japan would probably prompt the United States to examine \"gray zone
contingencies\" before responding, Harold said. Those would mean
learning, for example, whether the mishap involved Chinese naval boats
or fishing boats, Harold said. U.S. officials would explore further
whether Japan needed U.S. help or could follow up on its own, he said.
Allies, including the United States, U.K. and Australia, are making ever
clearer to China that they would \"react in a contingency,\" Harold
said. Informal Sino-foreign channels to bury accidents China and the
United States have their own informal resolution channel for collisions
and accidental misfires, lowering the risk of conflict, analysts
believe. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command holds regular maritime consultations
with the PLA to boost sea and air safety while reviewing any incidents,
a command spokesperson said. "U.S. Indo-Pacific Command vessels and
aircraft comply with international laws and norms that guide safe and
professional operations in international waters and airspace and we rely
on other nations operating in the Indo-Pacific to do the same," the
spokesperson said. [**[Beijing]{.mark} hopes to avoid war but [will fume

#### Counterforcing is [impossible]{.underline} -- they'll nuke us [from the water.]{.underline}

New Chinese Missile Submarine," Popular Mechanics, MAY 17, 2022
https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a40011949/satellite-spots-new-chinese-missile-submarine/

A commercial satellite has taken pictures of what is probably a new
Chinese missile submarine.

[The **submarine**]{.underline}, photographed in drydock,
[is]{.underline} likely nuclear [**powered** and built to **launch
cruise missiles.**]{.underline}

The new sub could also be [the first Chinese sub to incorporate a
**pumpjet propulsor**]{.underline} instead of a more traditional
propeller.

[Photographs taken by a U.S.-based commercial satellite firm show what
is likely a new type of Chinese navy submarine.]{.underline} The sub,
photographed out of the water in drydock, is likely a Type 093B, an
improved version of the Type 093 Shang class [nuclear powered
submarines.]{.underline} The subs are [likely meant to launch **cruise
missiles** at **enemy ships** and **land targets**, much like **Russian
submarines** have engaged targets on the ground in Ukraine.]{.underline}

The photos were taken by Planet Labs, with analysis done by AllSource
Analysis. The image depicts a submarine drydock at the Huludao shipyard
in Liaoning province. AllSource Analysis describes the submarine as 360
feet long with cruciform tail fins and control vanes on the sail.

One important detail of this new submarine: [the **tail** is apparently
**obscured from view**.]{.underline} All of China's submarines use
propellers as propulsors, but many newer U.S. and NATO submarines,
including the U.S. Navy's Virginia class and the Royal Navy's Astute
class, use pump-jet propulsors. A submarine equipped with [pumpjets can
sail more quietly than one with propellers]{.underline}, allowing a sub
to evade enemy listening devices and slip in closer to its target.
Hiding the tail strongly suggests the sub is not equipped with a
traditional brass propeller.

The Shang class, China's most recent class of nuclear powered attack
submarines, was developed in the mid-1990s and the first two subs were
commissioned in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Naval warfare authority
H.I. Sutton believes China has built at least 10 Shang submarines.

The U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the Shang class
is noisier than the Soviet Victor III-class submarines developed in the
late 1960s. This places them at least two generations behind their
American counterparts in terms of stealthiness. A pumpjet propulsor
would be a substantial upgrade for the Shangs without investing in a new
hull.

Meanwhile, [Defense News spotted an intriguing detail in its imagery of
the same submarine: **vertical launch missile silos** embedded in the
**hull** for **land attack** and anti-ship cruise missiles.]{.underline}
When cruise missiles first went to sea, submarines launched them from
torpedo tubes. Most of China's current submarines use this method. More
modern submarines, including the Virginia class, migrate cruise missiles
to separate vertical launch silos, [allowing a submarine to fire its
missiles]{.underline} while still keeping torpedo tubes dedicated to
torpedoes.

Earlier Shang submarines, with only six torpedo tubes, are unable to
launch more than six missiles at once---at the expense of not having any
torpedoes loaded and ready for self defense. The new submarine will
probably store at least twice as many missiles in silos, launching them
all in seconds and presenting a much more complex threat for the
defender to shoot them down.

[**In the event of war**, China will use submarines like the Type 093B
to **hit targets deep in enemy territory** with land attack **cruise
missiles**]{.underline}. The U.S. and Russia have used
submarine-launched cruise missiles to strike targets in Sudan,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. China
could use its submarines to attack targets in Taiwan, Japan, or given
the Type 093B's nuclear propulsion, as far away as Hawaii.

[SQUID-based magnetometers still suffer from **major
disadvantages**]{.underline}: [they require **extreme cooling** and can
be challenging to set up.]{.underline}40 [Together with their detection
range, this currently makes it **unlikely** that SQUIDs will be put on
satellites anytime soon.]{.underline} While cryogenic cooling is already
used in space for astronomy missions, it remains overly expensive.
Moreover, [space radiation **seriously affects** superconductive
technology generated signals]{.underline}.41 [Another problem is the
lack of **market proof processing solution**s to image and identify
findings]{.underline}. [Furthermore, submarines can apply **magnetic
shielding**]{.underline}. Similarly to preventing acoustic detection,
[stealth technology can **minimise** their magnetic
signature.]{.underline} Deploying magnetometers on planes, ships or
unmanned aerial, surface or underwater vehicles (UAV, UUS, UUV,
respectively) could provide more of a step-development in anti-submarine
warfare. But these platforms also pose some constraints. [UAVs require
**lightweight, small volume** and very **low power** consumption
devices.42 UUVs' limiting factor is its **battery life**, determined by
the **power demands** of the propulsion and onboard
systems]{.underline}.43 As one sensor produces too much noise, it
requires spatial correlation of a signal from more detectors. An array
of detectors is necessary. Yet [networked UAVs or UUV's covering a
specific area to find a submarine could **prove too costly**, especially
if they turn easy to defeat. As such, quantum magnetometers will
**unlikely be a game-changer** for now]{.underline}. Even if they
improve the location range to, say, 100 kilometres, this remains a
location which requires prior knowledge of the submarine's rough
position

Quantum gravity gradiometers will be very sensitive. That creates two
problems. First, although putting them in space would solve the issue of
their subsequent sensitivity to ground noise, [space-based quantum
gravity sensing or mapping is **unlikely to detect
submarines**]{.underline}. [Due to a combination of instrument
**sensitivity** and **satellite altitude**,]{.underline} [satellite
gravity sensing will have a **limited spatial resolution** on the
ground]{.underline}. Even if the currently estimated achievable
resolution of around 100 km could be reduced up to 10 km, it would still
be a few orders of magnitude the size of a submarine.46 Whether further
improvements will be possible remains to be seen after the first quantum
gravity gradiometers are put into space. [Second, even if the spatial
resolution would improve, gravity gradiometers would see a lot from
space as a lot is happening **in and above waters**]{.underline} --
think, for instance, of commercial underwater infrastructure, surface
ships, planes etc. [Even if a gravity gradiometer would be able to
detect and distinguish a submarine, further intelligence will need to
determine **whose and what type** of submarine it sees]{.underline}. Yet
classification is tough. Like with birdwatching, one needs to know very
well what to look for. Next to SSBNs waters are crowded with commercial,
research and conventional military submarines. In 2019, militaries of 40
states operated 491 conventional and nuclear subs.47 That number
excludes those owned privately or by research institutions.
Distinguishing a strategic nuclear submarine would thus most likely make
only sense through continuous tracking, so tracing nuclear submarines
down from their known ports/bastions. While submarines can shield
themselves from magnetic or acoustic detection, there are no methods to
shield from gravity gradiometers. Simply because such methods have not
been necessary so far. [Should this change, however, in the first
instance decision-makers will likely **do all possible** to hide their
submarines better]{.underline}. [One could design ways to **decrease**
the **detectable gravity signature** by improving mass distribution on a
submarines' hull]{.underline}. That would need to happen at the already
overly complex design stage of a submarine. Correcting mass distribution
in hindsight could turn out very tricky. Moving masses in a significant
way on a vessel is not easy in itself and might upset other optimisation
efforts. States building new SSBNs today would need to consider this in
advance.

## Counterforce Immoral

### 2AC -- Unethical

#### Utilization of nuclear weapons is unethical -- puts innocent lives at risk which is intrinsically wrong. 

**Giampaolo, 16** (Kayla, Giampaolo, 2-4-16, "Deterrence of
Disarmament?: The Ethics of Nuclear Warfare," [M.A. in Ethics &
Society](https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/people/kayla-giampaolo) from
Fordham University,
<https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/media/article/deterrence-or-disarmament-the-ethics-of-nuclear-warfare>)

[Most research across disciplines unanimously agrees that it is immoral
to detonate an atomic weapon due to both short and long-term
catastrophic effects.]{.underline} Therefore, this piece shall not focus
on the actual use of nuclear weapons, but instead analyze the latter
question. Using various philosophical concepts, it will explore the
fundamental question as to whether any implementation of nuclear
deterrence that involves a risk to civilians is morally acceptable. The
models, though differing in origin and rationale, provide a unique lens
from which to view this ethical dilemma.

Before analyzing various frameworks, [it is first important to
understand the concept of nuclear deterrence and why it is a pressing
ethical issue. Deterrence is a psychological phenomenon. It involves
convincing an aggressor not to attack by threatening it with harmful
retaliation]{.underline}. A psychological dimension is involved because
the success of deterrence is not due solely to the retaliators
capability, but to how persuasive the message of the threat is. In other
words, in order for deterrence to work, the opponent must perceive the
retaliatory threat as legitimate and serious (Morgan, 1985, p. 125).

[John Stuart Mills\' idea of utilitarianism provides an interesting
framework from which this issue can be approached. [Utilitarianism
claims that](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/utilitarianism),
\"the aim of action should be the largest possible balance of pleasure
over pain or the greatest happiness of the greatest number.]{.underline}
\"Therefore, the fundamental basis of this principle is that agents, in
this case military strategists, should strive to produce the greatest
amount of long-term satisfaction or pleasure for people as possible.

[One key component of this principle that is highly relevant to nuclear
deterrence is uncertainty. When consequences of actions are not known
for certain, one should choose whichever action has the
greatest expected utility.]{.underline} This is known as the Expected
Utility Principle (Oyshile, 2008, p.65).

The problem with this is that it is nearly impossible to calculate a
quantitative outcome by comparing deterrence with disarmament. This is
because it is hard to calculate the probability of what action the
opponent is going to choose. If the opponent is convinced by the threat
of retaliation, than nuclear deterrence is successful and maximum
utility is achieved. [But what if the aggressor is not persuaded by the
principle and chooses to attack anyway? Here a problem arises. Is it
better to retaliate as forewarned to save the most lives, or continue to
be attacked and avoid an immoral act?]{.underline}

When attempting to apply this to nuclear warfare, it initially seemed
impossible. Remember, the two options being compared are nuclear
deterrence and unilateral disarmament. It seems here that the worst
outcomes for both options are the extinction of all humans on earth. For
example, in both cases the rival country could continue to attack or
other nations that possess nuclear weapons could get involved. In its
most extreme form it is plausible that severe nuclear warfare could end
the world. Though, it should be noted that the probability of this
occurring in the case of disarmament is extremely low.

Though both concepts discussed aim to base ethical decision-making on
the best or greatest outcome, neither discusses the inherent goodness of
nuclear deterrence itself. Here it is useful to incorporate yet another
branch of philosophy: deontology. Deontology focuses on the rightness or
wrongness of the action, not on the rightness or wrongness of the
consequences (Johnson, 1998, p. 15). [From this framework, one could
argue that it is intrinsically wrong to put other human beings,
especially innocent human beings, at risk. Therefore, since the strategy
of nuclear deterrence puts innocent lives in both the opponent and
retaliatory countries at risk, then it too is intrinsically
wrong.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Preemption Bad

#### Preemptive strikes are not ethically justified---other ways to resolve conflict

**Freeman, 14** (Brenden Brower-Freeman, 2014, writer for JCCC Honors
journal, "The Ethics of Preemptive Warfare,"
<https://scholarspace.jccc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=honors_journal>//mahimahi)

[With issues such as the Syrian Civil War taking a central role in
current political discussion, it is important to understand fully what
is occurring in the conversations surrounding them.]{.underline} As some
people call for an attack on Syria to prevent the use of weapons of mass
destruction or the nation being used as an Al Qaeda base to attack the
United States, others call for an overthrow of the current regime
because its actions to date have been unethical. What exactly does this
mean[? When analyzing warfare, how can one frame ethics in such a way as
to capture the nuance that goes into warfare?]{.underline} This becomes
even more relevant when assessing the potential threats posed by North
Korea and Iran. Whether it is regarding the use of a computer virus to
attack an Iranian nuclear centrifuge or a missile to level a regime
facility in Syria, the issue at hand remains the same; whether
preemptive warfare is ever ethically justifiable[. [Nations]{.mark} like
Iran, Syria and North Korea could all [pose]{.mark} very [real]{.mark}
and **imminent [threats]{.mark}**, [and it is]{.mark} [important
t]{.mark}o [understand]{.mark} the proper [way to approach]{.mark} that
problem, just like any other. [Should there]{.mark} [be room]{.mark} [in
**ethics for**]{.mark} **the** **[preemptive strike]{.mark}**? The
[answer is no.]{.mark}]{.underline} There are three philosophies that
represent the ethics of war. These schools are Realism, Pacifism and
Just War Theory. There could be other names for methods of approaching
and viewing war and peace, but they will always fall into one of the
three previously mentioned traditional philosophies based on the ethical
criteria and principles of each. These approaches are evidently dominant
in this regard. First, it is important to understand what makes each
idea distinct and different from the other. Pacifism1 is unique in
positing that [**[no use of force]{.mark} [is]{.mark}** ever **ethically
[justified]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In [Pacifism, the thoughts and
notions of what is or is not ethical is applied broadly to relationships
between nation-states. In this school of thought, [it would not]{.mark}
[make sense to]{.mark} try to [determine whether]{.mark} a [war is
just.]{.mark} This is because the result of every attempt to make a
determination would yield the same result; that war is not just and
therefore not ever ethically justifiable]{.underline}. By contrast, Just
War Theory2 is on occasion favorable toward war and conflict. For
Pacifism, war is always and continually wrong. [**[War can never
be]{.mark} [a solution]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [there is always a
better]{.mark} [way to resolve the]{.mark} problem that is generating
[the conflict rather]{.mark} [than fighting]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Nuclear Fallout

#### Nuclear explosions lead to dangerous after effects -- nuclear radiation produces lethal effects that encompass greater distances 

**Wolfson and Veress, 20** (Richard Wolfson and Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress,
2020, Professor of Physics at Middlebury College and
scientist-in-residence and adjunct professor, "The Devastating Effects
of Nuclear Weapons,
<https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/devastating-effects-of-nuclear-weapons-war/>/mahimahi)

[The most [immediate effect]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [nuclear
explosion]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an intense [burst of **nuclear
radiation,**]{.mark} primarily **[gamma rays]{.mark} [and
neutrons]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark}[ [direct
radiation is produced]{.mark} in the weapon's nuclear reactions
themselves, and lasts well under a second]{.underline}. Lethal direct
radiation extends nearly a mile from a 10-kiloton explosion. With most
weapons, though[, direct radiation is of little significance because
other lethal effects generally encompass greater distances]{.underline}.
An important exception is the enhanced-radiation weapon, or neutron
bomb, which maximizes direct radiation and minimizes other destructive
effects.

[An [exploding nuclear weapon]{.mark} instantly [vaporizes
itself]{.mark}. What was cold, solid material microseconds earlier
becomes a gas hotter than the Sun's 15-million-degree core. This [hot
gas]{.mark} [radiates]{.mark} its energy [in the form of X-rays]{.mark},
which heat the surrounding air[. A fireball]{.mark} of superheated air
[forms and grows]{.mark} [rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}; 10 seconds after
a 1-megaton explosion, the fireball is a mile in diameter. The fireball
glows visibly from its own heat --- so visibly that the early stages of
a 1-megaton fireball are many times brighter than the Sun even at a
distance of 50 miles. Besides light, the glowing fireball radiates heat.

[[This]{.mark} thermal flash [lasts many seconds]{.mark} and accounts
for more than one-third of the weapon's explosive energy. [The]{.mark}
intense [heat can ignite fires]{.mark} [and cause **severe
burns**]{.mark} [on exposed]{.mark} [flesh]{.mark} as far as 20 miles
from a large thermonuclear explosion.]{.underline} Two-thirds of injured
Hiroshima survivors showed evidence of such flash burns. [You can think
of the incendiary effect of thermal flash as analogous to starting a
fire using a magnifying glass to concentrate the Sun's rays. The
difference is that rays from a nuclear explosion are so intense that
they don't need concentration to ignite flammable
materials.]{.underline}

The intense heat can ignite fires and cause severe burns on exposed
flesh as far as 20 miles from a large thermonuclear explosion.

As the rapidly expanding fireball pushes into the surrounding air, it
creates a blast wave consisting of an abrupt jump in air pressure. The
blast wave moves outward initially at thousands of miles per hour but
slows as it spreads. It carries about half the bomb's explosive energy
and is responsible for most of the physical destruction. Normal air
pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch (psi). That means every
square inch of your body or your house experiences a force of 15 pounds.
You don't usually feel that force, because air pressure is normally
exerted equally in all directions, so the 15 pounds pushing a square
inch of your body one way is counterbalanced by 15 pounds pushing the
other way. What you do feel is overpressure, caused by a greater air
pressure on one side of an object.

[Nuclear weapons have devastating effects. **[Destructive
blast]{.mark}** [effects extend miles]{.mark} from the detonation point
of a typical nuclear weapon, [and **lethal fallout** may]{.mark}
[blanket communities]{.mark} hundreds of miles [downwind of]{.mark} [a
single nuclear]{.mark} [explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An
all-out [[nuclear war]{.mark} [would leave]{.mark} **[survivors
with]{.mark} [few means]{.mark}** [of recovery]{.mark}, [and could
lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a [total breakdown]{.mark} of society. Fallout
from an all-out war would expose most of the belligerent nations'
surviving populations to radiation levels ranging from harmful to
fatal]{.underline}. [And [the effects]{.mark} [of nuclear war]{.mark}
[would extend]{.mark} well [beyond]{.mark} the [**warring nations,**
possibly including climate change]{.mark} severe enough to threaten much
[of]{.mark} the planet's [human population.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Debate about national and global effects of nuclear war continues, and
the issues are unlikely to be decided conclusively without the
unfortunate experiment of an actual nuclear war. But [enough is
known]{.mark} [about nuclear war's]{.mark} possible [effects
that]{.mark} [there is near]{.mark} **[universal agreement]{.mark}**
o[n]{.mark} [the need to avoid them]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the great
science communicator and astronomer Carl Sagan once said, "It's
elementary planetary hygiene to clean the world of these nuclear
weapons." But can we eliminate nuclear weapons? Should we? What risks
might such elimination entail? Those are the real issues in the ongoing
debates about the future of nuclear weaponry.

Act](https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt617/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1215) of
2020 signaled a sense of urgency and suggested that several federal
agencies create a national strategy on artificial intelligenceThere is
draft legislation, at both the state and federal level, to promote
responsible use of AI and prevent its misuse.

Strong objections to the use of facial recognition and other AI systems
by law enforcement in the U.S., raised by civil liberties advocates,
have led some local authorities, such as the City of San Francisco,
to [ban such
systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/facial-recognition-software-controversy.html?action=click&module=MoreInSection&pgtype=Article&region=Footer&contentCollection=Technology).
To [use a Silicon Valley phrase, these debates are "not a bug, but a
feature." They shine a light on the limitations of AI systems and help
to set the "rules of the road" for proper use of AI. This will establish
the U.S. as a global leader in AI regulation, once lawmakers and
regulators do their work. [China,]{.mark} meanwhile, [has faced]{.mark}

and [patents](http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2021/12/22-Wake-Forest-J.-Bus.-Intell.-Prop.-L.-43.pdf) by

with the United States in this field. [[The increased focus is]{.mark}

### 2AC -- Biotech

#### No CRISPR impact -- China regulating in squo

David **Cyranoski 19**; cites He Jiankui who speaks during an interview
at a laboratory in Shenzhen. ("China set to introduce gene-editing
regulation following CRISPR-baby furore" Nature. May 20, 2019.
<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01580-1>

[[China is]{.underline}]{.mark} poised **[[to introduce a new regulation
on gene editing]{.mark} in humans.]{.underline}** A draft of the
country's new civil code lists human genes and embryos in a section on
personality rights to be protected. [[Experiments]{.mark} on genes in
adults or embryos that endanger human health or violate ethical norms
[can]{.mark} accordingly [be seen as a violation of]{.mark} a person's
fundamental [rights.]{.mark}]{.underline} Lawyers say [the regulation
would mean that anyone who manipulates genes in humans is responsible
for what happens to a person.]{.underline} "The law makes clear that
those who do research with human genes and embryos cannot endanger human
health or violate ethics," says Zhang Peng, a criminal-law scholar at
Beijing Wuzi University. **[[China has been revising its civil
code]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the overarching legal framework that
governs non-criminal disputes in areas such as marriage, inheritance and
personal rights --- since 2002. [The latest draft was submitted last
month to the **country's chief legislative body**,]{.underline} the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and is likely to
be adopted next March. The inclusion of gene editing in the latest draft
of the new civil code was a last-minute addition, however --- prompted
by uproar over gene-editing experiments carried out last November by
Chinese [biophysicist He Jiankui]{.underline}. He claimed to have done
experiments on human embryos that resulted in twin girls whose DNA had
been engineered to make them less susceptible to contracting HIV. The
controversial experiments drew condemnation in China and
internationally, and led to He's sacking from the Southern University of
Science and Technology in Shenzhen in January. He [was]{.underline} also
[censured by Chinese authorities]{.underline}, but it was not clear
whether he had broken any of the country's laws. [The revised civil code
places experiments using human genes or embryos under the section of the
code that ensures a person's right to physical well-being, freedom,
privacy and dignity. It is the first time that regulations relating to
genomes have been included in the civil code]{.underline}, says Zhang.
If the new code had been in effect when He was considering his
experiments, it might have dissuaded him, says Zhang. Even if He's work
did make the twin girls less likely to get HIV, it's possible that he
inadvertently increased their susceptibility to other infectious
diseases. But there's also a danger that his experiments made unintended
modifications in their genomes, as often happens in gene-editing
experiments in the laboratory, leaving the twins vulnerable to genetic
diseases. Under these regulations, such gene-editing experiments would
be illegal, says Zhang. In March, [[the health ministry]{.mark} also
[**drafted regulations** that would **require**]{.mark} scientists to
get [**approval** before editing human embryos]{.mark}, and would impose
penalties for those who broke the rules.]{.underline}

#### 

#### [No Chinese innovation]{.underline} -- [party constraints]{.underline} and [economic realities]{.underline} of Chinese markets make it [impossible]{.underline}.

Regina **Abrami 14**, Director of the Lauder Institute\'s Global Program
and Head of its International Studies faculty at the University of
Pennsylvania, "Why China Can't Innovate",
<https://hbr.org/2014/03/why-china-cant-innovate> //lenox

Innovation from the Bottom Up [**There are limits**, though, to what
even so muscular and motivated a government as China's can mandate when
it comes to **innovation**]{.underline}. Against the government's
intentions and national resources run powerful currents that originate
in China's Communist system and ancient culture. Cons[ider how those
forces can **constrain** the entrepreneurial creativity bubbling up in
China]{.underline}. In the early 1990s Edward Tian (Tian Suning), a
U.S.-educated entrepreneur, founded the telecom start-up AsiaInfo (now
AsiaInfo-Linkage), which within three years grew into a thriving company
of 320 people with revenue of \$45 million. In 1996, frustrated with the
slow pace of technological change in China's telecommunications
industry, then--vice premier Zhu Rongji convinced Tian that it was his
duty to leave AsiaInfo in order to lead a new company, China Netcom, as
it set out to build a fiber-optic network linking some 300 cities. When
one of us (McFarlan) visited the company, in 2001, it was an innovative
firm with an open, creative culture, despite the fact that it was
jointly owned by four government agencies. In 2002, when the
telecommunications giant China Telecom was broken apart by the
government, its 10 northern provincial markets were integrated into
China Netcom. Overnight, Tian became responsible for an organization of
230,000. The [culture clash between the two organizations was
extraordinary]{.underline}. [Tian was seen by many China Telecom
employees as **an American outsider** trying to reform a state-owned
enterprise in unacceptable ways]{.underline}. Six months after the
merger, McFarlan presented our case study on China Netcom to 70 senior
Chinese executives, including 20 from the telecom industry. Rather than
draw lessons from the case about the relationship between organizational
change and business success, [the group attacked Tian for his
"**un-Chinese" ways of managing**---and then charged McFarlan with
incompetence for presenting Silicon Valley culture in China in such a
positive light]{.underline}. Tian soon stepped down from his CEO role
and later from the China Netcom board. To outsiders, China Netcom
eventually looked like a modern telecom firm, with the governance
structures needed to be listed on international stock exchanges. But [it
remained at heart a state-owned enterprise]{.underline}. When we teach
our current case on China Netcom, we ask MBA students to scour the
company's board for the real boss. Where, we ask, is the party
secretary? [The Communist Party requires a **representative** to be
present in every company with more than 50 employees]{.underline}.
[Every firm with more than 100 employees must have a party cell, whose
leader **reports directly** to the party in the municipality or
province]{.underline}. These [requirements **compromise** the
proprietary nature of a firm's strategic direction, operations, and
**competitive advantage**, thus **constraining** normal competitive
behavior, not to mention the **incentives** that drive founders to grow
their own businesses]{.underline}. But [**even if** the government were
to disband party cells and instead redouble its efforts to encourage
breakthrough innovation, there remains an even stronger
disincentive:]{.underline} the [**economic realities** of the
**markets** in which Chinese companies operate]{.underline}. Why go to
the trouble to pioneer innovative offerings when the rewards and growth
prospects for incremental improvements are so vast, both at home and
abroad? Consider the B2B portal Alibaba, which in 2001 was so shaky that
we feared it would go bankrupt. But by creatively adapting foreign
technologies to the needs of developing markets, Alibaba now serves 80
million customers in nearly 250 countries. The success of its auction
website, Taobao, eventually forced eBay out of China. Or take Baidu, the
Chinese search engine leader, which has grown massively in its home
market with an offering that breaks no technological ground and does not
challenge political orthodoxy. Having tailored its product,
organization, and processes to the needs of China's patchwork of
regional markets, Baidu now has an 80% share of what has become the
world's largest search market. Just as Japan caught up with the United
States technologically in many industries during the three decades after
World War II, China is now doing the same through incremental
innovations. Adapting technology has become a standard and highly
lucrative practice. [Getting that technology through **acquisitions**,
though, is an important new trend]{.underline}.

#### No [super soldiers]{.underline} -- insufficient knowledge and it takes [at least a century]{.underline} to develop.

Popy **Pandey 21**, Fanatic about science, history, and religion. Top
writer in Science, "Is China Using Genetic Engineering to Develop
Genetically-Modified Super- Soldiers?"
<https://medium.com/predict/is-china-attempting-to-develop-biologically-enhanced-super-soldiers-through-genetic-engineering-c88b3d1b7a3a>
//lenox

John [Ratcliffe is]{.underline} particularly [concerned about China's
rapid advancements in '**CRISPR**-Cas9' genetic engineering
technology]{.underline}. CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary technology that
enables geneticists and medical researchers to edit specific regions of
the genome by deleting, inserting, or modifying DNA sequences. This is a
very strong tool for a genetic alteration that was initially designed
with the goal of curing hereditary illnesses. In 2020, two biologists
were given the Noble Prize for this technology: Emmanuelle Charpentier
and Jennifer Doudna. In 2018, He Jian Kui, a researcher working in
China, claimed to have used this procedure to create two genetically
modified human infants, named 'Lulu' and 'Nina'. Initially, this
achievement was lauded throughout the world, but subsequently, as
experts dug deeper into He Jian Kui's method, they harshly criticized it
for ethical reasons. Without any methodical approach and without
investigating the consequences of these experiments can result in fatal
diseases in humans. In response to the global outrage, He Jian Kui was
sentenced to three years imprisonment by a Chinese court. Later in the
year, the Chinese government committed to enacting legislation governing
human gene editing. However, Ratcliffe's accusation that China conducts
biological tests on its soldiers has dragged back China into the
argument. Ratcliffe is not the only one to make such claims. Earlier
this year, two researchers, [Elsa Kania, and Wilson Vorndick expressed
concern about China's possible use of 'CRISPR-Cas9' technology to
**weaponize** its soldiers]{.underline}. Additionally, they asserted
that China is attempting to connect biotechnology, supercomputing, and
cognitive sciences. Furthermore, both researchers asserted that
'Biotechnology' was a primary priority area for China's strategic and
defence development. [One point worth noting is that **neither** Elsa
Kania nor Wilson Vorndick claimed that China has **achieved any
success** with these methods of genetically engineering their army. They
only stated that the Chinese army is actively engaged in genetic
engineering]{.underline}. Ambition Vs Reality Wilson Vorndick, a former
navy officer, seemed more concerned with the future consequences of gene
editing than with China's ability to build super-soldiers. In 2019, the
science journal 'Nature' expressed concern, that gene-editing techniques
could have negative consequences for humans. These approaches have the
potential to cause major mutations, posing harm to the entire humanity.
Additionally, the mutation created by the technique will be very
difficult to be detected. Although China has denied all of these
allegations and described the US as a malicious propagandist. However,
due to China's lack of transparency, verifying the veracity of claims is
exceedingly difficult. However some experts suggest, [it is
**exceedingly unlikely** that China will succeed in such
endeavours]{.underline} in the near future. Let\'s understand why?
Possibility of Super-Soldier In a report published in BBC, Elsa Kania
disagrees with Ratcliff's assertions, believing that [China is only
conducting field trials for **exploratory purposes** and developing a
super-soldier is **not easy** for any nation across the
world]{.underline}. [Because our **resources are insufficient** to
develop a super-soldier via genetic engineering at the
moment]{.underline}. Additionally, sh[e cites the **ineffectiveness** of
gene editing techniques in mature adults when compared to embryonic gene
editing]{.underline}. Dr. Helen O'Neill, a molecular geneticist at
University College London, also disagrees with Ratcliff's claim she is
more worried about the possibilities of such technology than with the
production of super-soldiers. Pointing out the limitation of
gene-editing technology, scientists Christophe Galichet underscores the
lack of precision of these technologies. He continued, '[Although gene
editing is conceivable, we are still **unknown** about the complete
function of genes; if we change a sequence of DNA, it is possible that
it may confer additional strength on the subject, but it is also
possible that it will have **unintended consequences**]{.underline}.
Additionally, some experts believe that China is being inspired by the
west in these initiatives. According to a 2017 report from 'The
Guardian,' US military agencies are investing millions of dollars in
gene extinction technologies that can be used to eradicate malarial
mosquitoes, invasive rodents, and other species.' This has raised
concerns because, while they intend to use the technology to eradicate
invasive species, but it has the potential to be misused. France and the
United Kingdom both issued guidelines in 2020, directing researchers to
conduct research on enhanced soldiers within critical boundaries.
Although numerous western countries conducted genetic engineering
research, none aroused as many ethical concerns as China. Impact on
Geopolitics BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute), a Chinese genome
sequencing company, had marketed millions of COVID-19 test kits outside
of China. Apart from this, BGI's parental test kits are quite well-known
worldwide. However, Reuters uncovered in an independent study that 'this
Chinese corporation is selling prenatal tests globally, manufacturing
these kits in partnership with the country's military, and utilizing
them to harvest genetic data from millions of women for large-scale
population studies. US security officials warned American labs against
using such China-made testing kits as these can be leveraged for the
collection of genetic data in order to push genome research in China.
Even though BGI rejects these charges, Reuter stated that the evidence
in hand is insufficient to prove anything, but the connections between
BGI and the Chinese PLA are deeper. China has strengthened the linkages
between its commercial firms and military-related research activities in
recent years. Previously, BGI collaborated with the PLA on the
development of technology to prevent altitude sickness among Chinese
soldiers. The majority of China's population lives in Western China,
whereas their most significant borders with India are in the south and
west; these borders are characterized by high altitude topography.
According to 'The New Indian Express,' China is currently constructing
multiple permanent military structures around the India-China border,
named the LAC(Line of Actual Control). China attempted to intrude on the
Indian side of the border on numerous occasions, resulting in numerous
clashes, the most notable one was the 'Galwan Clashes.' Both sides
suffered huge losses in the 'Galwan clashes' due to the high altitude
and rough terrain. The higher altitude on the Chinese side across LAC
gives China an operational advantage during times of conflict. However,
the Chinese army suffers a lot to defend these posts along LAC because
of high altitude sickness and related health problems. PLA has performed
a variety of scientific studies in the past to address concerns about
China's west and south-west border's higher altitude. Even if this
doesn\'t conclude the possibility of a super-soldier, experts say this
is alarming because it is the first step toward a military-genetic
engineering link. Conclusion Although [Ratcliff's assertions appear a
little **far-fetched**]{.underline}, China's suspicious practices
refocus analysts' attention on them. [Even if they succeed in generating
mutant super-soilers, it will take them a minimum of a **century of
time**]{.underline}, [because our existing scientific understanding is
**insufficient** to accomplish such a feat]{.underline}. However, due to
China's lack of transparency, we would never know what is truly going on
inside the country.

#### [No impact]{.underline} to Chinese bioweapons.

However, [an advanced **biological weapons program** is **not enough**
to classify as a threat; there also needs to be a **real intent** to use
those weapons.]{.underline} When it comes to China's intention, it is
possible that [**China would not** choose to **use biological weapons**
in any capacity because of the **suffering** the country saw **due to
Japan**'s use of Shigella and plague against the nation. During the 1991
BTWC Review Conference]{.underline}, the Chinese delegation stated, "Of
bacteriological weapons, **[China]{.underline}** has always
[**advocated** the complete **prohibition** and **thorough destruction**
of biological weapons and pursues a policy of not developing, producing,
or stockpiling this type of weapon]{.underline}."20 More recently, the
Chinese Foreign Ministry stated in 2011 that [China continues to support
the "complete prohibition and thorough destruction of]{.underline} all
kinds of weapons of mass destruction, including [biological
weapons]{.underline}."21 At the same time, China was not involved in the
BTWC negotiations and, before signing the treaty, ensured the inclusion
of a clause that meant the treaty was only binding if all other
countries in the treaty were also following the guidelines, essentially
giving the state an out to not only pursue biological weapons but to use
them if necessary.22 This action indicates that the Chinese wish to
leave the possibility of using biological weapons open as a policy
option, which in turns means a certain amount of willingness to utilize
the weapons if the need arose. [Overall, China may have the capability,
but **Beijing** may **not have the will** to put its own people at
risk]{.underline}, which is what makes the new subfield of genetic
weapons both fascinating and frightening.

Title: [China's Missile Program **Far Exceeds** The Capability
Demonstrated By **US**, Russia So Far -- US Intelligence
Report]{.underline}

[Russia and China have been increasing their joint military training at
sea, in the air, and on land]{.underline} over this year, Russian
Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, he
spoke with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, via video conference.

"Our armed forces interact on land, at sea and in the air. The number of
operational and combat training events is growing," Shoigu was quoted as
saying after the meeting in a statement from his ministry.

The collaboration between the armed forces of Russia and China has
reached a qualitatively new level in recent years, marking a
"breakthrough" in practical cooperation, Chinese Defense Ministry
spokesman Wu Qian said on Thursday.

"In recent years, under the strategic leadership of President Xi Jinping
and President Putin, the relationship of comprehensive partnership and
strategic interaction in the new era between China and Russia has
continued to develop; exchanges and cooperation between the armed forces
of the two countries in various fields have grown deeper; strategic
communication has reached a new level; a breakthrough has been made in
practical cooperation," Wu told a briefing.

Wu also stressed that Beijing firmly supports the deepening of exchanges
and contacts between the two countries, considering it instrumental to
maintaining peace and stability in the world.

[China's Missiles Worrying The World]{.underline}

[China tested a **nuclear**-capable **hypersonic glide vehicle** that
went around the globe before it **sped towards a target** in July this
year, in a test that shocked the world.]{.underline}

[It demonstrated superior capabilities with its hypersonic weapon
system]{.underline} and stunned officials in the West as well as in
India. However, there is more to the test that was initially known.

It has now emerged that [the hypersonic missile test included the launch
of a separate missile from the ultra-high-speed vehicle]{.underline},
The Financial Times reported quoting unnamed US intelligence officials.
Just a few days ago, [the US]{.underline} had [confirmed that the
hypersonic missile]{.underline} actually **["went around the
world".]{.underline}**

[This is the **first time ever** that any country has ever
achieved]{.underline} this feat which required [**firing a missile**
from a **parent vehicle** with a speed of **Mach 5**]{.underline} or in
other words, [**five times** the **speed of sound**.]{.underline}

[Neither the United States nor Russia]{.underline}, two countries with
the most advanced military capability and technology [have demonstrated
this capability yet.]{.underline}

In a test that was conducted sometime around late July-early August,
[the guided hypersonic bomb was carried around the world by a long-range
missile before being released on a test target within
China.]{.underline}

The hypersonic missile, which can be guided unlike ballistic missiles,
missed the target by more than 20 miles (32 kilometers), which according
to top US military official, General John Hyten, was "near enough" for a
first test.

However, the latest reports have revealed that [while flying from the
south]{.underline} toward China, [the hypersonic vehicle **launched a
separate missile**]{.underline} that rocketed away and landed safely [in
the **South China Sea.**]{.underline}

The release took place while the vehicle was traveling at hypersonic
speeds, exceeding 3,835 mph (6,175 km/h). China's principal adversary,
[the **US is still flustered** and is internally
brainstorming]{.underline} as to [how China could achieve such a
feat.]{.underline}

China's test of a globe-circling hypersonic weapon in July included the
unprecedented launch of a separate missile from the ultra-high-speed
vehicle, according to the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal.

[The test showed China's development of its strategic, nuclear-capable
weapons as **more advanced** than **any had thought**, surprising
Pentagon officials]{.underline}, South China Morning Post reported.

Pentagon Baffled By Chinese Missile

Pentagon technology experts are baffled as to how the Chinese were able
to accomplish this extraordinary milestone. The released missile's
probable purpose was unknown. It might be used to aim or deflect a
hypersonic attack on an adversary country's defenses. However, [it has
got alarm bells ringing in the West.]{.underline}

A hypersonic system that can travel around the world and fire missiles
at that speed is unprecedented and threatens the US, its allies and
their various military assets around the globe.

"The People's Liberation Army now has an increasingly credible
capability to undermine our missile defenses and threaten the American
homeland with both conventional and nuclear strikes," Mike Gallagher, a
member of the House Armed Services Committee, was quoted as saying by
the Financial Times.

Washington is expected to have taken cautious note of China's hypersonic
test and is developing a powerful laser weapon capable of blasting
missiles and drones after China's latest "nuclear-capable hypersonic
missile" test.

China's Hypersonic Capabilities

#### Vacuum decay won't cause [universal collapse]{.underline} -- it's [science fiction.]{.underline} Worry about the [nukes.]{.underline}

Title: [The **Universe** Is **Not in Danger** of Ending From a **Higgs**
Boson **Vacuum Bubble**]{.underline}

[There are few easier ways to get people to read your website than to
scare them. That's how we ended up with]{.underline} the media frenzy
surrounding Tiangong-1, and it's why InfoWars continues to exist. It's
also how we've ended up with [folks telling you the universe is due to
end.]{.underline} Heck, we're guilty ourselves.

Our universe had a beginning---the Big Bang. But we'd all like to know
what the end would be like. Perhaps it will collapse in a big crunch, or
keep expanding onwards forever. But since scientists discovered the
Higgs boson particle back in 2012, some have wondered whether something
stranger might happen.

A theoretical physics paper recently came out in the journal Physical
Review D that really did foretell the universe's end. Here's a rather
upsetting snippet:

"Since the lifetime \[of the Standard Model of particle physics\] is
finite and the Universe infinite, there is likely a bubble of true
vacuum already out there, far away. It is sobering to envision this
bubble, with its wall of negative energy, barreling towards us at the
speed of light. It seems the long-term future of our Universe is not
going to be slow freezing due to cosmic acceleration but an abrupt
collision with one of these bubble walls."

That paper then predicts that the universe's lifetime would be between
1088 and 10241 years, but probably probably around 10139 years. [That's
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,]{.underline}

[000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
years.]{.underline}

This is not something you should worry about. At all. Despite recent
headlines in Newsweek, Business Insider, the Daily Mail, and others.

Here's what the paper's actually saying. [The universe is made from
teeny particles. The rules that govern those particles are called the
Standard Model of physics. A few of those particles called the W+, the
W-, and the Z, have mass, but several decades ago physicists thought
they shouldn't. They solved that problem with a theoretical particle
(and corresponding field) called the Higgs boson.]{.underline}

CERN scientists finally confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson back
in 2012 by slamming other particles together at the Large Hadron
Collider in Switzerland. Many theoretical physicists were interested in
the Higgs' mass, because alongside another particle called the top
quark, they could be used to determine whether the vacuum of the
universe was "metastable" or "stable."

Think of the vacuum of the universe (the nothingness) as a surface upon
which all of the laws of physics happen. If [**the universe is
stable**,]{.underline} [there's **nothing below the surface**---it's the
true bottom.]{.underline} If the universe is metastable, then perhaps
there's a true bottom beneath that floor. The idea is that maybe
somewhere in our vast cosmos, the floor might break. That effect would
ripple through the entire universe at the speed of light as the fake
floor falls out to the real one.

The laws of physics would no longer work as we expect, since there's now
a new definition to what a "vacuum" means. Perhaps nothing would be able
to exist in such a vacuum.

The team of Harvard physicists were interested in the lifetime of the
metastable Standard Model for the same philosophical reasons that
everyone has pondered the end. And the number they got, 10139, is
actually quite satisfying.

"I think people don't have a sense as to how big these numbers are,"
study author and physicist Matthew Schwartz from Harvard told Gizmodo.
"It's such an enormous out of time. But they think 10139 years is 139."

The universe is around 10 billion, or 1010 years old. 10139 is a
completely unfathomable number of years. If you could imagine the entire
length of the universe from the Big Bang to now as a single day on
Earth, 10139 years would still be\... far longer than the current age of
the universe. It's more than the amount of time it would take to count
every atom in the universe, if you had to wait from the Big Bang until
now in between counting each atom. That number of years eludes any
rational attempt to understand it (Which is probably why it sounds so
close---our heads just short circuit and say, threat!!!). It is forever.

"I think people don't have a sense as to how big these numbers are."

And here's the other thing: Physicists still don't know for sure whether
we live in that metastable universe or not. It looks like we do, based
on current measurements, but further refining of the Higgs' and top
quark's masses might reveal the first measurements were slightly off and
we actually live in a stable universe. Maybe our floor is the real
floor.

There are good reasons to study these things, said Schwartz. If their
calculations had revealed that the Standard Model could only last for a
million years, then there would have to be some other physics, perhaps
new particles explaining why we were still here. But Schwartz and his
team's calculations imply that [the **Standard Model** could last **just
fine** without anything else, **even if** we did live in this
**metastable state**.]{.underline} It's also different from the
conventional story, that eventually everything stops moving.

[**You should not worry** about **vacuum instabilities** causing the
universe to end. **If you're worried** about the fate of humanity, you
should **worry about nukes**]{.underline}, climate change,
antibiotic-resistant pathogens, food insecurity, or clean water. [**The
universe will be just fine**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Modernization

#### China [already]{.underline} has the [nuclear triad.]{.underline}

Kris **Osborn 21**, President & Editor-In-Chief of Warrior Maven, "China
Solidifies \"Air Leg\" of Nuclear Triad Weapons Systems,"
<https://warriormaven.com/global-security/china-nuclear-h-20>, cy

[China is now taking substantial]{.underline} and decided
[steps]{.underline} forward [to solidify the]{.underline} air-leg of a
[**"nuclear triad"** with the addition of a **nuclear-capable** H-6N
**bomber**, according to the Pentagon's recently released 2021 report on
China's military capability.]{.underline}

China is known to operate road-mobile ICBMs and of course arm its
Jin-class submarines with JL-2 and emerging JL-3 nuclear capable
missiles, yet it is only in recent years, if not months, that the
People's Liberation Army Air Force has resurrected its airborne leg.
This quite simply means that China will operate with an ability to hold
targets around the world at risk of nuclear attack from the air as well
as from the ground and sea.

[PLAAF: Airborne Leg of Nuclear Triad]{.underline}

"[In]{.underline} October [2019,]{.underline} the [PRC signaled the
return of the **airborne leg** of its nuclear triad]{.underline} after
[the PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as its first **nuclear**-capable
**air-to-air** refuelable bomber]{.underline}," the Pentagon report,
called "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's
Republic of China 2021," states. "[The H-6N features a modified
fuselage]{.underline} that [allows it to carry]{.underline} externally
an **[air-launched ballistic missile]{.underline}** (ALBM) [that may be
nuclear]{.underline} capable."

Activating a nuclear-capable bomber such as the longstanding H-6N, soon
to be joined by the new stealthy now-in-development H-20 bomber, is a
key part of a large-scale Chinese nuclear weapons modernization and
expansion campaign.

[ICBMs]{.underline}

This effort, as detailed by the Pentagon report, is placing the People's
Republic of China on track to have "at least 1,000 warheads by 2030,
exceeding the pace and size the DoD projected in 2020. This number of
warheads will spread across a range of weapons systems to include
road-mobile ICBMs with multiple reentry vehicles, submarine-launched
nuclear weapons, aircraft and new ground-based ICBMs launched from silos
now under construction.

Earlier this year, Adm. Charles Richard, Commander of U.S. Strategic
Command, said that commercial satellite photos reveal ICBM-delivering
ground silos under construction in parts of mainland China, a
concerning, while not surprising development for Pentagon strategists
tracking the PRCs ambitious, large scale nuclear weapons expansion.

"[The PRC has commenced building **at least three** solid-fueled **ICBM
silo fields**]{.underline}, which will cumulatively contain hundreds of
new ICBM silos," the Pentagon report states. An expanded force with new
silos may suggest the [China is evolving its nuclear weapons readiness
posture to a **"Launch-on-Warning" position.**]{.underline}

Nuclear Capable Air-Launched Ballistic Missile

[China is also supporting the air leg of its "nuclear triad" by
developing a **nuclear capable** air-launched **ballistic
missile,**]{.underline} a weapon which could represent an effort to
match the now developing U.S. nuclear-capable air-launched cruise
missile called the Long Range Stand-Off Weapon (LRSO).

The concept with an air-launched ballistic missile or cruise missile is
to add new dimensions to a deterrence strategy by giving commanders a
wide range of options with which to hold enemies at risk.

In this case, a long-range, aircraft-fired nuclear weapon could make a
country vulnerable without needing a Stand-In, closer range bomber to
operate above targeted territory, likely armed with advanced air
defenses. The tactical notion, it seems clear, is to prepare for the
widest possible sphere of contingencies.

Perhaps land-based ICBMs are destroyed or overwhelmed? Perhaps
submarine-launched nuclear armed missiles are disabled, found or not in
a position to strike? Perhaps nuclear-armed aircraft cannot survive
stand-in operations in close proximity to air defenses? Should all of
these things somehow develop unexpectedly at the same time, what options
might remain? This would be where an air-launched, yet long-range
nuclear weapon might prove uniquely valuable.

China\'s H-20 Stealth Bomber

[China's new stealthy **H-20 bomber** is expected to operate with an
ability to carry **both conventional and nuclear** weapons and fly at
ranges out to 8,500 kilometers]{.underline}, a new Pentagon report on
China says.

## No Limited War

### 2AC -- Generic Draw In

#### Avoidable US-China wa causes [extinction]{.underline} and [draws in]{.underline} other countries

Kevin **Rudd 22,** global president of the Asia Society and former prime
minister of Australia, "A U.S.-China War Would Dwarf the Destruction in
Ukraine. Both Sides Must Act Now to Avoid It,"
<https://time.com/6164184/how-us-china-avoid-war/>, cy

[A U.S.-China War Would Dwarf the Destruction in Ukraine]{.underline}.
Both Sides Must Act Now to Avoid It

he world's attention is rightly focused on the unfolding horror in
Ukraine. Images of destruction and death wrought across that nation, and
the harrowing experiences of refugees fleeing in their millions, testify
to the tragic reality of war. And in the capitals of Europe, something
once thought an impossibility---a large-scale 21st century war on the
continent---has now become all too real, awakening once idealistic
nations to the hard truth that such senselessness violence has not been
eliminated from our modern, globalized world.

The scenes in Kyiv and Mariupol should serve as an abrupt wakeup call to
those public figures who have talked loosely about inviting open warfare
in our world. Most of them have never seen war themselves, or borne
witness to its human cost.

In this grim moment it is important to think through, and coldly
reassess the dangers presented by other potential conflicts that could
be sparked by today's geopolitical tensions. [The **most significant**
among these is, without doubt, the possibility of a war between the U.S.
and China. It is a prospect that we must now acknowledge is no longer
unthinkable.]{.underline}

Were such a conflict to begin, whether over a crisis in the Taiwan
Strait, in the South China Sea, or any number of other unpredictable
flashpoints, such a war would almost certainly be many times more
destructive than what we are seeing in Ukraine today. [It would be a
conflict with **vast scope** for **escalation** across **every domain**,
from the seas to **space**, and likely to **draw in many other
countries** across the world, including America's allies in the Pacific.
Such a conflict would be a catastrophe for both countries---and for us
all.]{.underline}

War between the United States and China is not inevitable. But
U.S.-China relations continue to spiral downward, their strategic
relationship adrift and buffeted by growing global crises. Muddling
through will be wholly insufficient to avoid conflict. To avoid
sleepwalking into a war, both countries must construct a joint strategic
framework to maintain the peace---and quickly.

In my new book, The Avoidable War: the Dangers of a Catastrophic
Conflict between the US and Xi Jinping's China, I offer one such
framework, which I call "managed strategic competition." The idea is
relatively simple.

First, [the United States and China must have a **clear**, granular
**understanding** of each other's irreducible strategic **redlines** in
order to help prevent conflict through miscalculation.]{.underline} Each
side must be persuaded to conclude that enhancing strategic
predictability advantages both countries, strategic deception is futile,
and strategic surprise is just plain dangerous. This will require a
focused, detailed diplomatic understanding on Taiwan.

Second, both countries must then embrace the reality of their
competition---that is, to channel their strategic rivalry into a
competitive race to enhance their military, economic, and technological
capabilities. Properly constrained, such competition can deter armed
conflict rather than tempt either side to risk everything by prosecuting
a dangerous and bloody war with unpredictable results. Such strategic
competition would also enable both sides to maximize their political,
economic, and ideological appeal to the rest of the world. The strategic
rationale would be that the most competitive national system would
ultimately prevail by becoming (or remaining) the world's foremost
superpower and eventually shaping the world in its image. May the best
system win. And I'm confident which one I'd bet on.

Third, this framework would create the political space necessary for the
two countries to continue to engage in strategic cooperation in the
areas where their national interests align. These spheres include:
climate change, preventing the next pandemic, and maintaining global
financial stability.

Finally, for this compartmentalization of the relationship to have any
prospect for success, it would need to be carefully and continuously
managed by a dedicated matching of cabinet-level senior officials on
both sides. For the U.S., this also means any such framework would need
bipartisan buy-in so it could withstand the turbulence of domestic
politics. For a priority this important, this should by no means be
impossible.

This approach will face criticism in both Washington and Beijing for not
being sufficiently sensitive to each side's national interests. To some
in Washington, it will smack of appeasement. This is false: cold,
realistic deterrence is at the core of any comprehensive strategy toward
China. Meanwhile many in Beijing will argue it doesn't sufficiently
account for China's core interests on Taiwan, and broader national
pride. But as Moscow just learned in Ukraine, war and economic
devastation would suit China's interests far less.

Ultimately, my challenge to critics of managed strategic competition,
and putting guardrails to the U.S.-China relationship, is simple: Come
up with something better. There is little time to waste.

I have long studied, lived in, and come to deeply respect both the
United States and China. [The prospect of war between the two nations
would be **catastrophic.**]{.underline} And, watching the destruction in
Ukraine, I cannot help but recall the memory of marching as a small
child in our annual ANZAC Day parade---the Australian equivalent of
Memorial Day---in our tiny country town with my father, who had fought
in World War II, alongside elders who had fought in World War I.

The world managed to sleepwalk into the slaughter of that first Great
War, which claimed more than 15 million lives. With our eyes now wide
open, [we will have **no excuse** if we fail to avoid walking into yet
another global catastrophe today.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- India Draw In

#### Sino-India relations are [irredeemable]{.underline} -- India [sides]{.underline} with the West in a conflict which causes escalation

Will India Side With the West Against China? A Test Is at Hand [The
United States and its allies have long wanted **India's help** in
**confronting China.**]{.underline} Now, [a deadly **border clash**
seems likely to **push India** in that direction]{.underline}. For
years, [the United States]{.underline} and its allies [have tried to
persuade India to become a closer military and economic
partner]{.underline} in confronting China's ambitions, painting it as [a
chance for the world's largest democracy to counterbalance the largest
autocracy]{.underline}. Last week, the idea of such a confrontation
became more real as Indian and Chinese soldiers clashed in the worst
violence on the countries' border in 45 years, leaving 20 Indian troops
dead and causing an unknown number of Chinese casualties. Prime Minister
Narendra Modi has publicly reveled in the prospect of a more muscular
role for India in the region and the world. But analysts say the new
tensions with China will be the starkest test yet of whether India is
ready --- or truly willing --- to jostle with a rising power bent on
expanding its interests and territory. With China facing new scrutiny
and criticism over the coronavirus pandemic, Indian officials have
recently seemed emboldened, taking steps that made [Western diplomats
feel that their goal of an India closer to the West was starting to be
realized. And some believe the friction with China will push India even
further in that direction.]{.underline} This month, India signed a major
defense agreement with Australia that allows both countries to use each
other's military bases. [And it is expected to invite Australia to join
naval exercises it conducts with Japan and the United States, to
strengthen efforts by the so-called Quad --- Australia, Japan, the
United States and India --- to counter China's projection of sea power
in the region.]{.underline} India's campaign for a larger profile in
multinational organizations has also moved quickly. On Wednesday, it was
elected unopposed to a nonpermanent seat on the United Nations Security
Council. And in May, it won the chair of the World Health Organization's
executive board, where it promptly supported calls to investigate the
origins of the coronavirus --- an inquiry China had fought to block. But
India is still well behind China when it comes to military and economic
power. That may give India's leaders pause over the prospect of an armed
escalation on their disputed Himalayan border, where the bloody clashes
broke out last week. "India will have to deploy all three --- military,
economic and political options," said Samir Saran, the president of the
Observer Research Foundation, an influential think tank in Delhi. "China
is a large and powerful country, and a sustained response to their
aggression will have to include all of these." "The defense of
liberalism and democracy and an international open system will play out
between India and China," he said. Chinese and Indian generals continue
to meet along the border to discuss de-escalation efforts. And Indian
officials acknowledged on Friday that the night before, China released
10 Indian soldiers seized during the fighting. (Later, China's foreign
ministry spokesman said he did not know of any prisoners being taken,
but did not explicitly deny India's announcement.) But the troop buildup
is continuing, with villagers in the area and satellite imagery
indicating that both sides are still sending in reinforcements. On
Saturday, the Indian government released a statement blaming China for
trying to erect structures across the disputed border, in territory
Delhi considers its own. The government added that it would not allow
China to make any unilateral changes to the border. Though India denies
it, independent military analysts have estimated that Chinese troops
have seized control of about 23 square miles of Indian territory in the
past two months, But India's military ability to retaliate may be
limited for now. While its military is one of the world's largest, it
has failed to modernize and stay competitive, watching as China rapidly
surpassed it over recent decades. This year, India announced a military
budget of nearly \$74 billion, compared with Beijing's \$178 billion. In
India's case, much of that spending is going to pay pensions.
Economically, India has become more willing to use its vast market as a
lever to pressure China. In April, it passed legislation requiring
government approval for any investments from Chinese entities, a setback
for China as its companies look abroad for growth. And Reuters reported
on Thursday that India planned to raise tariffs on Chinese goods.
Diplomats expect India to prevent the Chinese telecommunications giant
Huawei from entering its market to build a 5G wireless network. The
United States accuses Huawei of aiding the Chinese government in
cyberespionage, and it has urged its allies to block the company's 5G
development. Although India's potential buying power gives it one way to
slap at China, it has nowhere near the spending and lending capacity
that China has used to increase its global influence. Still, Indian
officials have embraced the idea of being a democratic counterbalance to
China, and the coronavirus has offered a chance to push that narrative
as countries fume over Beijing's handling of the pandemic. Indian
political figures went on the offensive after the pandemic began,
criticizing China's authoritarian system and its lack of transparency as
the coronavirus spread beyond the city of Wuhan, where it is widely
thought to have begun. Vijay Gokhale, who recently retired as India's
foreign secretary and is still close to the government, wrote a lengthy
opinion piece this month in which he blasted China's handling of the
pandemic. "The shortcomings of the regime," he wrote, "will further fuel
a debate on the superiority of the Chinese model as an alternative to
democracy. Will this form the ideological underpinning for the birth of
a new Cold War?" The pandemic also gave Mr. Modi a chance to tap his
country's giant pharmaceutical industry to strengthen diplomatic ties.
Diplomats stationed in India say that in the early days of the crisis,
he and his foreign minister were "constantly working the phones" to
offer countries help with medicines. One Western diplomat felt that the
coronavirus crisis had made India more eager to build stronger
relationships to help it deal with China, and that diplomacy with India
was going more smoothly than ever before. "[Everyone is more
willing]{.underline}, privately, [to talk about what to do with
China]{.underline} in a post-Covid world," the diplomat said speaking on
condition of anonymity. "[The ways]{.underline} that [China has
influenced]{.underline} that [world order can now]{.underline} more
easily [be discussed]{.underline} as we are all trying to figure out
what the new world order is. "**[India represents one
path]{.underline}**," the diplomat added, "and **[China represents
another]{.underline}**." More immediately, India faces the prospect of
an escalation at the border, where China had been building up its forces
before the violence last week. "India wants peace," Mr. Modi said
Wednesday[, "but if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting
reply."]{.underline} China's push at the border is not an isolated show
of strength. Since the pandemic's start, China has flexed harder on many
different fronts: It sank a Vietnamese shipping boat, harassed Malaysian
oil rig operations and tightened its control over Hong Kong in hopes of
stamping out the pro-democracy movement there. [But India has several
reasons to feel particularly hemmed in by China]{.underline}. Over the
past decade, [China has heavily courted India's neighbors]{.underline},
unraveling New Delhi's influence on its own doorstep. As Indian and
Chinese troops clashed in the Himalayas, [Nepal's
government]{.underline} simultaneously [claimed a sliver of
territory]{.underline} on its border that India considers its own.
India's defense minister recently suggested that [Nepal's border actions
were taken at **the behest of China**]{.underline}. [In
Pakistan]{.underline}, India's archrival, [China is building huge
infrastructure projects]{.underline}, some in territory that the Indian
government disputes. [With every project built]{.underline}, [China is
making it harder for India to hold on to its territorial
claims]{.underline}. And right off India's southern coast, [China took
possession of a port in Sri Lanka]{.underline} after that country could
not pay its debt to Beijing. Some Indian officials fear that [China
could **militarize the port**]{.underline}, which Sri Lanka denies.
"[India went from having a monopoly of political and military power in
the region to]{.underline} dealing with a marketplace of [competition
where China is increasingly predominant]{.underline}," said Constantino
Xavier, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. He predicted that the new
wave of border violence would prompt India to push back harder. Some see
China's buildup on the border as a calculated effort to keep India's
aspirations in check. "[**China doesn't** particularly **want India to
succeed**,"]{.underline} said Tanvi Madan, the director of the India
Project at the Brookings Institution. "A weaker India will do less
strategically in its own neighborhood, allowing China to step in more;
and it will engage less in places like East Africa or in regional
institutions, posing little challenge to China." [China has also been
sensitive about the prospects of closer ties between India and the
West.]{.underline} On Wednesday, Global Times, a mouthpiece for the
Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial claiming that the United
States had given Mr. Modi's government false confidence, and that it
would ultimately abandon India. "The resources that the U.S. would
invest in China-India relations are limited," the editorial read. ["What
the **U.S. would** do is just **extend a lever to India**, which
Washington can exploit to worsen India's ties with China."]{.underline}
Despite warm meetings between Mr. Modi and President Trump, their
countries' relationship has at times been rocky. But given China's
increasingly hard line in territorial disputes, some Indian officials
fear there may be little choice but to look West. In an opinion piece
last week, Mr. Gokhale, the former Indian foreign secretary, said that
countries could no longer ignore Beijing's transgressions and must
choose between the United States and China. ["In the post-Covid age," he
wrote, "enjoying the best of both worlds may no longer be an
option."]{.underline}

Overall, [the decline in U.S. warfighting advantages does not mean China
can win a war that the United States is willing to fight. By 2025, a war
could be a military standoff, with major weapon-platform losses on both
sides, in addition to losses in cyberspace and space. Yet neither side
would fare so much worse than the other that it would feel compelled to
concede, raising the probability that a war would be both **severe and
long.**]{.underline} Such a war could be decided by economic costs,
domestic political effects, and international responses. Japan's

\[Table 3.7 Omitted\]

entry could offset the decline of U.S. military superiority, especially
in a prolonged conflict. All these factors, taken together, would
strongly favor the United States.

Recall the earlier observation that war between China and the United
States could be worse than the long, severe case, as described here. [In
the 20th century, two great-power wars became world wars, and **a third
could have followed the same course**, or even worse.]{.underline} [The
possibility of a Sino-U.S. war **drawing in other powers** and many
states cannot be excluded: In addition to Japan, perhaps India, Vietnam,
and NATO would be on the U.S. side; Russia and North Korea would be on
China's side.]{.underline} Fighting could spread beyond the region. War
aims could expand, and as they did, so would the costs of losing. Even
if nuclear weapons were not used, China might find other ways to attack
the United States proper. Use of space and cyberspace could be severely
curtailed. As long as fighting remained inclusive, destruction and
hardship could fuel determination and further mobilization. In sum, both
the duration and severity of war could exceed the upper case used here
for purposes of analysis. [If so, **losses and costs would be even
greater for both sides and the world**, and the outcome would be no more
favorable for China, despite the expansion of its power.]{.underline}

unilateralism but also for **protecting against** what they assume is
the ultimate goal: **regime change** in Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline}

[Putin has gone to great lengths to shore up embattled
dictators]{.underline}---including Belarus's Aleksandr Lukashenko,
Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Kazakhstan's Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and
Venezuela's Nicholas Maduro---to prevent these leaders from being
toppled at the hands of foreign pressure. [**Putin** has also **viewed
the backing** of like-minded **autocrats as critical**]{.underline} [to
building his image]{.underline} with onlooking leaders [as a reliable
partner]{.underline} willing and able to compete with Washington as a
security provider.

[**Xi** has similarly **backed illiberal regimes**]{.underline} in his
periphery, including in Myanmar and Cambodia, [and has **complemented
Russian** efforts to shore up embattled leaders]{.underline} such as
Maduro and Tokayev. The CCP---and [Xi personally]{.underline}--- have
[leaned into propaganda about the superiority of China's authoritarian
system]{.underline} and the relative weakness of democracies during the
pandemic. Like Putin[, Xi is driven]{.underline} not only [by the
need]{.underline} to defend against Western efforts to use color
revolutions to weaken regime control but also the need [to prevent
authoritarian failures that might tarnish views]{.underline} of his
increasingly strongman rule [at home.]{.underline}

[Xi is therefore likely to seek to prevent Putin, his closest friend and
partner, from falling]{.underline}. [Indeed, Xi would view the
**prospect of a collapse** of Putin's regime as a **direct threat** to
his rule in the wake of his personal and public endorsements of the
Russian leader.]{.underline} China's population must not witness the
popular overthrow of Putin, China's partner in promoting an alternative
vision for effective authoritarian governance and standing up to
interference from the lecturing West. [Furthermore, Xi **does not want
to set a precedent** where a U.S.-led]{.underline} sanctions and
pressure [campaign among allied democracies is permitted]{.underline} to
successfully unseat unfriendly leaders.

[[Ties]{.mark} between Russia and China are
[deepening]{.mark}]{.underline}. The relationship between Russia and
China has improved steadily since the waning years of the Cold War. This
trend [accelerated]{.underline} in the last decade and especially since
2014 [when]{.underline} Russia's illegal annexation of [Crimea shut down
Russian opportunities in and cooperation with the West]{.underline}.
[Indicators [across]{.mark} virtually [every
dimension]{.mark}]{.underline} of the bilateral relationship [highlight
their growing alignment]{.underline}.1 Economically, [[China is the
**largest purchaser of Russian**]{.mark} **crude [oil]{.mark}** and has
surpassed Germany as Russia's **[largest trading
partner]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Militarily, [their defense cooperation
continues to grow]{.underline}, including through defense dialogues,
joint exercises, and regional security cooperation. [**[Russia]{.mark}**
continues to **[sell China]{.mark}** increasingly **[sophisticated
military tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}, though that aspect of the
relationship has diminished in relative importance as China has enhanced
its capabilities in this area. Politically, Russian President Vladimir
**[[Putin and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Chinese President
**[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping **[[enjoy close
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and exchanges and interactions at
lower levels of the Russian and Chinese governments are frequent. 2.
Russia-China **[relations [will continue to
deepen]{.mark}]{.underline}** as the key drivers of their relationship
strengthen and constraints erode. **[[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}** Putin
and Xi **[[view the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as a significant
threat to their power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Their shared perception of
the United States as a threat is an important driver of their
relationship. U.S. actions such as sanctions against Russia and the
administration's trade war with China are justified approaches to
addressing hostile adversaries, but also serve to push the two countries
closer together. The strong consensus in Washington around great power
competition as the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy is likely to
continue to provide incentive for greater alignment between Russia and
China. The growing similarity between the Putin and Xi regimes is also
likely to provide a basis for future cooperation. Xi has consolidated
power and dismantled the consensus-based decision making that has
dominated China's post-Mao political system. While meaningful
distinctions between the governments remain, China's political system
more closely resembles the Putin-dominated Russian regime.2 Research
suggests that shared regime type enhances cooperation between states.3
Not only are the key drivers of bilateral relations strengthening, but
many of the **[[factors that]{.underline}]{.mark}** observers long
assessed **[would [constrain the relationship are
eroding]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, analysts have long held that
[[Russian concerns about insecurity in its far east]{.underline}]{.mark}
would stymie cooperation. However, the Kremlin's concerns about this
source of insecurity [have [diminished]{.mark}]{.underline}; today, the
Russian and Chinese governments are moving ahead with infrastructure
projects in border regions that had long been delayed. Moreover, Putin
likely understands that China constitutes a long-term threat to Russia
but appears to calculate that a far-off and uncertain threat from China
is more acceptable than the immediate and certain threat he perceives
from the United States. Cultural factors and historical enmity are
likely to be enduring constraints on Russia-China relations. However, Xi
and Putin dominate the media environments in their countries and are
capable of slowly turning public opinion over time. Such a process would
be hard and slow, but Beijing and Moscow have the capacity to re-shape
public attitudes, should they decide to. Already, surveys show that 69
percent of Russians hold a positive view of China---the same percentage
of Russians that hold negative views of the United States.4 3. [Russia
and China are **[united in their discontent with U.S.]{.mark}
dominance**]{.underline}---a marriage of convenience---but [sustained
cooperation and repeated interaction raise the likelihood of more
meaningful alignment]{.underline}. Putin and Xi prioritize their own
survival in office above all else. They both judge that the United
States and its efforts to support democracy present a threat to their
hold on power, and that the U.S.-dominated international order
disadvantages them and fails to accommodate their interests. They are
united in their discontent and share an interest in weakening Western
cohesion and subverting many of the values and rules that define the
post-World War II order. Although they have banded together in
discontent, there is potential that their repeated interactions will
foster a deeper and more enduring partnership over time. Already,
Russian and Chinese values and views of the way the world should be
ordered are significantly aligned. Russia and China are likely to
continue to work together, and potentially coordinate their efforts to
create an environment that is conducive to both of their development
goals. 4. [Deepening relations between Russia and China will be [among
the most significant U.S.]{.mark} foreign policy
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} in the coming decade. Russia and China
are unlikely to forge a formal military alliance. But [even short of
such an alliance, their growing alignment and coordination will present
a significant challenge for U.S. national security]{.underline} in the
coming years. The Director of National Intelligence warned in his 2019
Annual Threat Assessment that strengthening ties between China and
Russia will present a "wide variety of economic, political,
counterintelligence, military, and diplomatic challenges to the United
States and its allies."5 If Russia-China relations continue to grow, it
[[would]{.mark} harm U.S. interests by [enhanc]{.mark}ing [their mutual
capabilities and stretching U.S. capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline},
complicating U.S. strategic planning by potentially dividing U.S. power,
emboldening them to act knowing they will have each other's support,
enhancing the perceived legitimacy of the alternative they provide, and
diluting U.S leverage over countries willing to play the United States
off Russia and China.6 Russia and China are also poised to challenge
U.S. interests through the complementarity of their actions.7 Russia and
China take different approaches to pursuing their foreign policy
objectives. Russian foreign policy is confrontational and brazen. So
far, China has used a subtler and more risk-averse strategy, preferring
stability that is conducive to building economic ties and influence.
Although their [tactics]{.underline} are different, they have the
potential to [converge in synergistic ways]{.underline} such that the
combined effects on U.S. interests is greater than the sum of their
individual efforts. This dynamic is most evident in Europe, but there is
potential for greater synergies between Russia and China [to create new
challenges]{.underline} for the United States.

### 1AR -- Taboo Breakdown 

#### More warrants --

There are good reasons for analysts to question the strength and
prevalence of an international norm against nuclear use, but here we
highlight several reasons why the **[[durability of]{.mark}
a]{.underline}** moral-based [nuclear **[taboo is
dubious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, the comparable case of strategic
bombing does not support hypotheses about how and when norm-violation
should strengthen morally-based taboos. Second, recent survey and
[[**social science research** challenges the durability]{.mark} of a
moral taboo]{.underline}. For example, surveys indicate that a majority
of Americans, who are supposed to have internalized the nuclear taboo,
would be willing to use nuclear weapons against terrorist adversaries or
Iran. Furthermore, experiments in [psychology tell us that **[leaders
can encourage their population to make]{.mark}** tragic
**[trade-offs]{.mark}**]{.underline} through their framing of choices.
The strategic bombing case illustrates one such trade-off: General
Eisenhower siding with strategic bombing proponents to facilitate a
quicker end to World War II. [**[Opposition]{.mark}** to the use of
nuclear weapons **[in the abstract does not guarantee opposition
in]{.mark}** times of **[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally,
**[[precedent logics]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- not moral logics --
appear to [**[more commonly underlie taboos]{.mark}** in
warfare]{.underline}. Once the bargain against bombing civilians broke
down, there was little moral compunction leading countries to stop
pursuing this strategy. Furthermore, the survey literature referenced
above suggests that respondents' reluctance to have the United States
employ nuclear weapons stems from a concern about precedence, not moral
authority. If the nuclear taboo is based upon concern for precedent and
not moral opprobrium, then resuscitating the taboo after an incident of
nuclear use may be unrealistic. These [findings point to a number of
policy implications]{.underline}. Most importantly, [policy-makers
should be aware of the **[challenges to the norm against nuclear use
after a future violation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both the moral logic
and precedent logic cause reason to be skeptical that the norm would
remain durable. As a result, **[[preventing nuclear use in the first
place is paramount]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States should
continue to seek to strengthen the global nuclear nonproliferation
regime, a major challenge at a time when NPT member states are so
divided over nuclear disarmament.86 U.S. leaders should refrain from
making casual nuclear threats against adversaries and should encourage
other leaders to follow suit. Moreover, in its declaratory policy, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should **restrict**]{.mark} **the
intended [use of its nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear
weapon[**[s]{.mark}** to deterring nuclear attacks]{.underline}. If the
United States or its assets were attacked with a nuclear weapon, leaders
would have to strongly consider whether responding in kind would do more
harm than good. Fortunately[, U.S. conventional superiority means that
the U.S. military would have many non-nuclear means to
respond]{.underline}. Finally, because we find that the precedent logic
to be more compelling in explaining non-use, the United States should
consider ways in which it can affect whether future nuclear use is
perceived as successful and how it can lead the international community
in bringing about a strong sanctioning response against those
responsible for such an attack. If nuclear use is perceived as
unsuccessful or the attacker is meaningfully punished, the precedent is
more likely to be re-established.

#### A counterforce strike would have less casualties -- weakens the justification for the taboo.

[The **[extent of collateral damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} caused by a
nuclear weapon [would]{.underline} likely [**[play a significant
role]{.mark}** in determining the durability of a nuclear non-use
norm]{.underline} based on moral considerations. [**[If a
nuc]{.mark}**lear detonation **[resulted in great
destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and many non-combatant causalities,
as would likely be the case with an attack that targeted a city or
generated substantial lethal nuclear fallout, one might expect that
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** moral underpinnings of the **[[norm would
remain intact]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and perhaps even be bolstered.
That is, a dramatic demonstration of the abhorrent consequences of
nuclear weapons use could serve to reinforce subsequent adherence to the
norm. **[[By contrast]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a nuclear attack that
resulted in very few casualties -- for example, as might conceivably
occur with **[[a limited counterforce strike using a few precise,
low-yield weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** appear to **[[weaken the
norm]{.underline}]{.mark}**ative constraint [against nuclear
use]{.underline}.30 That is, if the non-use norm were driven by
revulsion at the expected massive and indiscriminate devastation that
would occur if nuclear weapons were used, [an instance of nuclear use
that generated only modest collateral damage would undermine the
norm.]{.underline}31

## War Existential

### 2AC -- War = Extinction

#### US-China war goes [immediately existential]{.underline} -- even the [worst]{.underline} theoretical accounts fall short because nuclear war [cannot]{.underline} be controlled.

Andre **Damon 21**, Writer and editor for the World Socialist Web Site
specializing in geopolitics and economics, "What a US nuclear war with
China would look like",
<https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/25/nuke-m25.html> //lenox

The [tabletop military exercise proceeds as follows]{.underline}. During
a freedom of navigation exercise in the South China Sea taking place in
the year 2034, a group of US frigates board a Chinese civilian vessel in
distress. The Americans learn the vessel houses sensitive technology and
seize it. While the operation is underway, the US vessels are attacked
by a Chinese fleet, which totally paralyzes them using advanced
cyberweapons. When the [US dispatches two aircraft carrier battle groups
to the Pacific in a show of force]{.underline}, a total of 40 American
ships are sunk with negligible Chinese losses. The [numbers are not
quantified, but some tens of thousands of American]{.underline} sailors,
airmen, and marines [must have lost their lives]{.underline}. [In
response, Washington launches a **nuclear weapon** at a Chinese coastal
city, against which Beijing **retaliates** by launching a nuclear attack
on San Diego, California and Galveston, Texas. The US retaliates by
**obliterating Shanghai**, one of the world's largest and most important
cities]{.underline}. Stavridis writes that after an American nuclear
attack on Shanghai, "[These many months later the city remained a
**charred, radioactive wasteland**. The death toll had exceeded **thirty
million**. After each of the nuclear attacks international **markets
plummeted**. **Crops failed**. Infectious **diseases spread**. Radiation
**poisoning** promised to contaminate generations. The devastation
exceeded... capacity for comprehension]{.underline}." The [American
survivors]{.underline} of a Chinese nuclear attack on San Diego [are
left to live in "wretched camps," where "cyclical outbreaks of typhus,
measles, and even smallpox often sprouted from the unbilged latrines and
rows of plastic tenting]{.underline}." This appears to be a vision of
hell. But it must be stated bluntly that [even this depiction falls far,
**far short** of the **actual** effects of a nuclear world
war]{.underline}. By training and temperament, Stavridis is largely
incapable of viewing the world through the eyes of anyone besides a
military officer or "national security" bureaucrat. "Ordinary" people
are not described. The various protagonists take the lives of millions,
and it is very hard on them, and the reader is supposed to sympathize.
In Stavridis' account, the [decisions **governing** the conflict are
made by largely rational and analytical military technocrats. Elected
leaders notionally exist, and they sometimes take actions that impinge
upon the narrative]{.underline}, but it is the military officials that
largely guide the action. Just as politicians have little impact on the
plot, [social dynamics and popular opinion are largely
ignored]{.underline}. The [United States carries out a nuclear attack on
a Chinese **port city**]{.underline}, and it appears to have no domestic
social effect, except to lead the public to bray for blood.
[**Millions** are killed, tens of millions are displaced domestically in
the United States]{.underline}. In one single incident---the nuclear
bombing of Shanghai---the United States carries out an act of mass
murder surpassing in scale the vernichtungskrieg (war of extermination)
waged by Nazi Germany in the Eastern front over four years. Amid all of
this, there is no domestic social response. The end of World War I
toppled the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, and German empires in a massive
revolutionary upheaval. The end of the Second World War completely
redrew the map of Europe. But in Stavridis' account, the population
somehow remains complacent throughout a third world war while millions
are slaughtered. This has nothing to do with [the real world,
**dominated** by class polarization and conflict]{.underline}. War will
be accompanied by massive state repression. The pretext for a domestic
crackdown and the need to divert intense internal social conflicts
outward are, in fact, among the major unstated reasons why ruling
classes are embarking upon military confrontations that can end in the
acts of mass murder depicted in 2034. Finally, the [military dynamics
are themselves totally unrealistic. The central **assumption** of the
book is that there exists such a thing as a "**tactical**" nuclear
war]{.underline}. Military actions are calmly and rationally discussed
and deliberated. Even so, it is only through an absurd and unbelievable
plot twist that a strategic nuclear exchange is avoided. In a ridiculous
deus ex machina, India attacks both Chinese and US vessels, bringing
about an end to the war. [**There is no such thing** as a "tactical"
nuclear world war]{.underline}. There has never been a full-scale war
between two countries armed with nuclear weapons. More importantly,
there has never been a full-scale war between "great powers" armed with
21st century technology. The [range, cheapness, and speed of offensive
weapons, including drones and high-speed missiles, will mean that a
third world war will be conducted **everywhere at once**, at dizzying
speed and **complexity**]{.underline}. The logic of these
phenomena---the complexity of global relations and domestic opposition,
the [**expansion** of the battlefield to the entire globe, the
delegation of warfare to artificial intelligence---makes nuclear war
**impossible to control** and limit to the "tit-for-tat" military
exchanges depicted in the book]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- No Limited War

#### War goes [existential]{.underline} -- China doesn't go nuclear [immediately]{.underline}, but conventional war sets off [spirals]{.underline} that [escalate]{.underline} -- no chance for a [limited war]{.underline}.

[As China's power has grown]{.underline} in recent years, [so, too, has
the **risk of war** with the United States]{.underline}. Under President
Xi Jinping, u [has increased its political and economic pressure on
Taiwan and built military installations on coral reefs in the South
China Sea, **fueling Washington's fears** that Chinese expansionism will
threaten U.S. allies]{.underline} and influence in the region. U.S.
[destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from
Beijing]{.underline}. American policymakers have wondered aloud whether
they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well. Chinese
[fighter jets have **intercepted** U.S. aircraft in the skies above the
South China Sea]{.underline}. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has
brought long-simmering economic disputes to a rolling boil. A war
between the two countries remains unlikely, but the [prospect of a
military confrontation]{.underline}---resulting, for example, from a
Chinese campaign against Taiwan---[**no longer** seems as implausible as
it once did]{.underline}. And the [odds of such a confrontation going
**nuclear** are **higher** than most policymakers and analysts
think]{.underline}. Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to
dismiss such concerns. Likewise, [U.S. studies of a potential war with
China often **exclude** nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely,
treating them as basically irrelevant to the course of a
conflict]{.underline}. Asked about the issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, estimated the
likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere between nil
and zero." [This **assurance is misguided**]{.underline}. If deployed
against China, [the Pentagon's preferred style of conventional warfare
would be a potential recipe for **nuclear escalation**]{.underline}.
Since the end of the Cold War, the United States' signature approach to
war has been simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly
knock out the opponent's key military assets at minimal cost. But the
Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power. [If deployed
against China, the Pentagon's preferred style of conventional warfare
would be a potential recipe for nuclear escalation]{.underline}. [China,
by contrast, not only has nuclear weapons; it has also **intermingled**
them with its conventional military forces]{.underline}, [making it
difficult to attack one without attacking the other]{.underline}. This
means that a [major U.S. military campaign targeting China's
conventional forces would likely also **threaten** its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [Faced with such a threat, Chinese leaders could
decide to use their nuclear weapons while they were **still able
to**]{.underline}. As U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a relationship
fraught with mutual suspicion, they must come to grips with the fact
that a [conventional war could skid into a nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}. Although this risk is not high in absolute
terms, its [consequences for the region and the world would be
**devastating**]{.underline}. As long as the United States and China
continue to pursue their current grand strategies, the risk is likely to
endure. This means that [leaders on both sides should dispense with the
illusion that they can easily fight a limited war]{.underline}. They
should focus instead on managing or resolving the political, economic,
and military tensions that might lead to a conflict in the first place.
There are some reasons for optimism. For one, China has long stood out
for its nonaggressive nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in
1964, China largely avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much
smaller and simpler nuclear arsenal than its resources would have
allowed. Chinese leaders have consistently characterized nuclear weapons
as useful only for deterring nuclear aggression and coercion.
Historically, this narrow purpose required only a handful of nuclear
weapons that could ensure Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack.
To this day, China maintains a "no first use" pledge, promising that it
will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The prospect of a
nuclear conflict can also seem like a relic of the Cold War. Back then,
the United States and its allies lived in fear of a Warsaw Pact
offensive rapidly overrunning Europe. NATO stood ready to use nuclear
weapons first to stalemate such an attack. Both Washington and Moscow
also consistently worried that their nuclear forces could be taken out
in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear strike by the other side. This mutual
fear increased the risk that one superpower might rush to launch in the
erroneous belief that it was already under attack. Initially, the danger
of unauthorized strikes also loomed large. In the 1950s, lax safety
procedures for U.S. nuclear weapons stationed on NATO soil, as well as
minimal civilian oversight of U.S. military commanders, raised a serious
risk that nuclear escalation could have occurred without explicit orders
from the U.S. president. The good news is that these Cold War worries
have little bearing on U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country
could rapidly overrun the other's territory in a conventional war.
Neither seems worried about a nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian
political control of nuclear weapons is relatively strong in both
countries. What remains, in theory, is the comforting logic of mutual
deterrence: in a war between two nuclear powers, neither side will
launch a nuclear strike for fear that its enemy will respond in kind.
The bad news is that [one other trigger remains]{.underline}: a
[conventional war that **threatens** China's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. Conventional forces can threaten nuclear forces in
ways that [**generate pressures** to escalate---especially when ever
more **capable** U.S. conventional forces face adversaries with
relatively small and fragile nuclear arsenals]{.underline}, such as
China. If U.S. operations endangered or damaged China's nuclear forces,
Chinese leaders might come to think that Washington had aims beyond
winning the conventional war---that it might be seeking to disable or
destroy China's nuclear arsenal outright, perhaps as a prelude to regime
change. [In the **fog of war**, Beijing might reluctantly conclude that
limited nuclear escalation---an initial strike small enough that it
could avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation---was a viable option to defend
itself]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Yes Nuclear Winter

A [war using **even a small percentage** of the world\'s nuclear weapons
threatens the lives of **two billion people**]{.underline}, a new report
warns. The [findings in the report issued by International Physicians
for Prevention of Nuclear War (**IPPNW**) and Physicians for Social
Responsibility (**PSR**) are based on studies by climate scientists that
show how nuclear war would alter the climate and agriculture, thereby
threatening **one quarter of the world\'s population**]{.underline} with
famine. Nuclear Famine: Two Billion People at Risk? offers an updated
edition to the groups\' April of 2012 report, which the [groups say
\"may have **seriously underestimated** the consequences of a
**limited** nuclear war.\"]{.underline} \"A [nuclear war using only a
**fraction** of existing arsenals would produce **massive casualties**
on a **global** scale]{.underline}---far more than we had previously
believed,\" Dr. Ira Helfand, the report's author and IPPNW co-president,
said in a statement. As their previous report showed, years [after even
a limited nuclear war, production of **corn** in the U.S. and China\'s
middle season rice production would **severely decline**, and fears over
dwindling food supplies would lead to **hoarding and increases in food
prices**, creating further food insecurity]{.underline} for those
already reliant on food imports. The updated report adds that [Chinese
winter wheat production would **plummet**]{.underline} if such a war
broke out. Based on information from new studies [combining reductions
in wheat, corn and rice, this new edition **doubles** the number of
people they expect to be threatened by nuclear-war]{.underline} induced
famine to over two billion. \"The prospect of a decade of widespread
hunger and [intense social and economic instability in the world's
largest country has immense implications for the entire **global
community**]{.underline}, as does the possibility that the [huge
declines in Chinese wheat production will be matched by **similar
declines** in other wheat producing countries]{.underline},\" Helfand
stated. The crops would be impacted, the report explains, citing
previous studies, [because of the black carbon particles that would be
released, causing **widespread** changes like **cooling** temperatures,
**decreased precipitation** and decline in **solar
radiation**]{.underline}. In this scenario of famine, [**epidemics** of
infectious diseases would be likely]{.underline}, the report states, and
could lead to armed conflict. From the report: Within nations where
famine is widespread, there would almost certainly be food riots, and
[competition for limited food resources might well **exacerbate** ethnic
and regional animosities]{.underline}. Among nations, [**armed
conflict** would be a very real possibility as states dependent on
imports attempted to maintain access to food supplies]{.underline}.
While a limited nuclear war would bring dire circumstances, the [impacts
if the world\'s biggest nuclear arms holders were involved would be even
worse]{.underline}. \"With a large war between the United States and
Russia, we are talking about the possible ---not certain, but
possible---extinction of the human race,\" Helfand told Agence-France
Presse.

Editor\'s Note:

For the Chinese people, the past decade was epic and inspirational. The
country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Xi
Jinping at its core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy,
deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a
responsible power globally.

Currently, the world is turbulent and faces the tough questions of
\"what security ideas should the world embrace\" and \"how countries can
achieve common security.\" In this respect, China offers its own answers
by sticking to its own security formula. How should we view China\'s
idea of \"enriching the state and strengthen the army?\" How important
is the modernization of the PLA? The following article sheds light on
these questions.

This is the 10th of the series about this special decade.

[Summarizing Chinese security policy inevitably will hit upon the
formula \"Enrich the state and strengthen the army,\" which runs through
the entire history of China.]{.underline}

[In the past [China]{.mark}]{.underline} repeatedly paid a high price
for [[givi]{.mark}ng [priority to build]{.mark} a [flourishing]{.mark}
civil [society first]{.mark} before securing the means to defend it.
Again and again a prosperous China became a target of neighboring states
and remote colonial powers. Due to insufficient defense capabilities,
these countries carried away what was useful to them and destroyed what
could not be removed.]{.underline}

[These historical failures have taught important lessons. In order to
enhance its defense capabilities, China for a long time erected walls
all along its land borders. However, these unified defense measures were
not always successful. But even after temporary splitting and periods of
domination by foreign rulers, China has always found itself together in
renewed unity and preserved the size of its empire. It is this
impressive continuity which has made China rather unique in the
world.]{.underline}

The Communist Party of China (CPC) was founded in 1921 in the final
stage of another extended period of oppression and humiliation in recent
history. [By providing a convincing vision of a New China, the CPC
managed to attract the suffering masses from various strata of Chinese
society and establish itself as the leading political force. To
implement this goal, the Party understood the necessity to create an
army of its own to overcome the Kuomintang and warlords as main
adversaries in the civil war as well as foreign aggressors from Japan
and other countries. Thus, in 1927 the Party created an armed force of
its own.]{.underline}

Former leader Deng Xiaoping launched the policy of reform and opening-up
to the outside world in 1978. [To reach this goal, he promulgated the
\"[Four Modernizations]{.mark},\" meaning the modernization of science
and technology, agriculture, industry, and defense. It is significant
that defense takes the last position. This [matches]{.mark} perfectly
the traditional [notion of first enriching]{.mark} the [state]{.mark}
and only afterwards strengthening the army.]{.underline}

Let us turn again to the build-up of the Chinese People\'s Liberation
Army (PLA). After the CPC assumed power, the Soviet Union carried the
hope to exert control over the PLA and bind it into a Moscow-led
collective defense system. The CPC never thought to comply with such an
endeavor and successfully maintained its independence. No effort has
been spared to implement and defend this policy. It was in 1970 when
China successfully completed an important step toward military
modernization. [This was announced as \"Two bombs and one satellite\"
hinting at the [capability of]{.mark} handling the [fission]{.mark} and
fusion technology of [nuclear warheads]{.mark} as well as the capability
to produce [missiles]{.mark} as carrier vehicles for these weapons by
launching a satellite. Although China gradually increased its arsenal of
these weapons, it **[solemnly declared it would never be first in
applying them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The continued enormous progress
in the development of China\'s economy has provided solid fundamentals
for the comprehensive modernization of the armed forces.]{.underline}

[In the process of opening up to the outside world, the PLA has
[e**ngaged in U**]{.mark}**nited [N]{.mark}ations [peacekeeping
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** for more than 30 years. It started with
[bridge building]{.mark} and other [infrastructure projects]{.mark} in
Cambodia and has meanwhile been extended to more than 20 countries,
mainly in Africa. **Chinese troops** have **[participated in 25]{.mark}
UN [peacekeeping missions]{.mark}** so far, deploying 50,000 men and
women of which 16 have sacrificed their lives. Currently there are 2,240
Chinese officers and troops serving in UN peacekeeping operations and at
UNHQ. As regards the contribution of military personal, China is [at the
**top among**]{.mark} **the [five permanent members]{.mark}** of the UN
Security Council and takes rank 10th position among all UN member
states. It is highly noteworthy that the [participation]{.mark} in these
international missions clearly has [proven]{.mark} **China\'s
[determination to]{.mark} contribute to the [build]{.mark}ing of a [more
peaceful]{.mark} and safer [world]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[It [must not be overlooked that]{.mark} the [modernization]{.mark} of
the PLA first and foremost is [pursued to serve]{.mark} the [needs
of]{.mark} the [country]{.mark}]{.underline}. When the PLA celebrated
its 90th anniversary in 2017 it showed an overwhelming display of modern
weaponry which might have left some foreign observers uneasy. [However,
China has clearly stated that the purpose of this arsenal is only to
protect China\'s core interests and [territorial integrity]{.mark}.
China\'s [rise]{.mark} is peaceful and [poses no threat to]{.mark} any
[other country]{.mark}. If **[confrontation]{.mark}** should occur, then
it will **[not]{.mark} be [caused by China]{.mark}**, but by foreign
countries, **particularly [by the US]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

This is not a new phenomenon at all. After the US completed the
occupation of its continental territory in the 19th century, Admiral
Alfred Thayer Mahan expanded the [\"Go West\" strategy to the sea and
claimed the whole Pacific Ocean up to the coast of China belonged to US
jurisdiction. Deriving from this imperialist legacy, the [US
assumed]{.mark} an [obligation as]{.mark} a [global]{.mark} maritime
[police force]{.mark}. Time and again the US has expressed [worries that
China]{.mark} might [close shipping lines]{.mark} through the South
China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. This **[is groundless]{.mark} and
[untrustworthy]{.mark}**, because it **would diametrically run against
Chinese interest**s. The project of the **Belt and Road Initiative**,
particularly its maritime component, shows clearly that **China pays
great attention** to unimpeded international navigation at sea. While
the US as a self-declared policeman pretends to implement the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it has itself never ratified
the agreement]{.underline}. The US has used for decades the Philippines
and other countries bordering the South China Sea to challenge the
sovereignty of China over the South China Sea. Ancient Chinese maps
dating from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), produce irrefutable evidence
that the archipelagos in the South China Sea have been part of China.

Taiwan for a long time has been a target of dispute between China and
the US. When former US president Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, he
signed the Joint Communiqué with premier Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. The US
thereby acknowledged that there is but one China in order to pave the
way for mutual recognition according to international law and to open
diplomatic relations. But this has not prevented the US Congress from
unilaterally promulgating the Taiwan Relations Act permitting the US
government to continue the conclusion of profitable arms deals with
Taiwan. Simultaneously, the US has supported activists of \"Taiwan
independence\" at times discretely, at other times loudly provoking,
sowing discord between China and the US and turning the Taiwan question
into a stumbling block in bilateral relations between the two countries.
Apart from 50 years of Japanese colonial rule which ended in 1945,
Taiwan has always belonged to China. Taiwan thus being part of China is
longer than the existence of the US as a sovereign power.

[Under the leadership of the CPC, China has become the second-largest
economy in the world. Former US president Donald Trump said: \"There are
some people who wish I would not refer to China as our enemy. But
that\'s exactly what they are.\" Whereas Trump made this statement at
the beginning of an emerging trade war, his successor President Joe
Biden increasingly refers to China as a political enemy. Former
Australian prime minister and China expert Kevin Rudd goes even one step
further and speaks of the inevitability of war between China and the
US.]{.underline}

[Under such circumstances it is understandable that China takes
efficient measures to defend itself.]{.underline} General Secretary of
the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping is deeply committed to the Chinese
Dream, to the rejuvenation of China, [whereby the basic mission of the
CPC currently consists of the preparation of means to protect the
prosperity of the nation. So far, there has been no reason to doubt the
peaceful character of China\'s rise or that it might turn into a
threat]{.underline}. China has been respecting its borders and will not
be crossing them. **[[China is]{.mark} by nature a [peace-loving
country]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### An increase of China and US [tension is inevitable,]{.underline} but [conflict is not]{.underline} inevitable

**Lieven, 20** -- (Anatol Lieven- British author, journalist, and policy
analyst best known for his expertise on the Taliban of Afghanistan. He

U.S. [competition]{.underline} with China [is]{.underline} real,
serious, and [bound to increase.]{.underline} [That is
inevitable]{.underline}, both for economic reasons and because of the
incompatibility between Chinese ambitions and the U.S. establishment's
determination to maintain U.S. global leadership[. However**, it is not
an existential struggle between two fundamentally opposed systems, nor
is it a universal struggle that must be fought in every corner of the
world.**]{.underline} A comparison with basic features of the Cold War
should make the difference clear. [China is not promoting communist
revolution around the world]{.underline}. In fact there is no evidence
at all that it is aiming at the overthrow of existing states. [As a
great capitalist trading power, it has a strong stake in the stability
of markets and the safety of Chinese investments. If the Chinese
government in principle prefers authoritarian states, it has as yet done
nothing to foster such systems.]{.underline} Chinese influence
operations in the West are real and should be resisted, but they are
intended to influence Western policies toward China, not cause state
collapse and revolution. [And the United States has an old and tried
arsenal of international influence operations of its own that it can
deploy in response. As to the U.S. political system, the impact of
Chinese (and Russian) covert propaganda on U.S. politics has been
minimal compared to the impact of the United States' own domestic
problems]{.underline}. It was not China that killed George Floyd. As a
capitalist trading state, [China is dependent on the health and
stability of the international capitalist system]{.underline}. Unlike
the Soviet Union, it needs a degree of rules-based international
order---though not if (as seen from China) this means a system in which
the United States sets all the rules and then breaks them whenever it
wishes. On the other hand, China has certainly sought with great
determination to increase its international influence through
international capitalism. Some of these efforts (like Huawei's role in
fifth-generation telecommunications technology) must be strongly
resisted. [They do not however as yet greatly exceed past U.S. patterns
of international economic influence.]{.underline} The defense and
strengthening of U.S. capitalism in competition with China is indeed
essential, but needs to be seen not just in terms of tariffs on Chinese
imports (as the Trump administration has seen it), but as requiring a
massive program of U.S. domestic economic reform and investment in
infrastructure and technology---in other words[, the way the Chinese
government conducts this competition]{.underline}.

#### China is an axial economy -- it has interests in maintaining the global market order -- prevents war from being inevitable

[Why China Need Not Be Feared]{.underline}

[The rise of China has sparked fear in some American thinkers and
policymakers who believe that power equals threat and changes in
relative power result in conflict and war.69 I argue, however, that such
[**fear is unwarranted** unless China has]{.mark} a [status
economy]{.mark}; status powers have an interest in sowing chaos wherever
they lack control, which is diametrically opposed to the contractualist
preference for order and self-determination. [China, however,
has]{.mark} neither a status nor a contractualist economy, but **[an
axial economy]{.mark}** (see table 1). As the world\'s largest exporter
with considerable public and private trading sectors, China possesses an
economy not unlike those of ancient Athens, the Italian city-states of
the Renaissance, and the European kingdoms of the Enlightenment. The
elites of those [societies]{.mark}, like China\'s today, [embraced
long-distance **commerce**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Axial states can wage wars over global markets. Historical examples
include the Venetian-Genoese wars of the early Italian Renaissance, the
Anglo-Dutch wars of the second half of the seventeenth century, and the
Anglo-French wars of the eighteenth century. These wars were fought for
control of markets and maritime trade routes, not global leadership. As
discussed above, elites in axial economies perceive little interest in
the welfare of strangers and thus non-discriminatory trade.

The last time a leading contractualist power dealt with an
axial-capitalist peer competitor was in the nineteenth century. In the
decades before World War I, axial Britain was in the process of
transitioning toward a contractualist economy (see table 1). In the
first decade of this century, axial China was moving rapidly toward
becoming a contractualist economy.70 The parallels are uncanny: both
countries wildly embraced trade, but with a mix of normal and
mercantilist arrangements. Although both China today and Britain then
had normal trade relations with many countries, both had, or continue to
have, discriminatory relations in other spheres: just as British
merchants had privileged access to the markets of many of Britain\'s
colonies and Dominions and used military force to collect debts, China
today seeks privileges for its state-owned enterprises in its internal
market and abroad and imposes harsh terms on states that fail to pay
their debts.71

[Similarly, just like Britain a century ago, [China]{.mark} today
appears to be increasingly acting as if it [has]{.mark} an [**interest**
in]{.mark} the **[global market order]{.mark}**. Late-nineteenth-century
Britain provided the world a trading currency by backing the pound
sterling with gold, and British bankers financed projects all over the
globe. Recently, China ceased undervaluing the yuan, indicating that it
has an interest in the health of economies beyond its borders, and is
now providing as much financing to developing countries as the World
Bank.72]{.underline}

[[Just as]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Britain]{.mark} managed to **[avoid]{.mark} serious [militarized
conflict]{.mark}**[, so too can]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}. Negotiated [solutions]{.mark} are
[possible]{.mark} because, like Britain, China has an interest in the
global market order. Despite its rise, [China]{.mark} has
[become]{.mark} far **[friendlier to]{.mark} its [neighbors]{.mark}**
and others than it was as a status power, when it fomented revolution
abroad under the leadership of Mao Zedong. China has **[resolved]{.mark}
most of its [territorial disputes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.73 Largely,
only its maritime disputes are ongoing, and these are not new, having
originated in the pre-communist period.74 [In recent years, China has
**[established]{.mark} diplomatic [relations]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
many [countries it once treated as enemies]{.mark}, including Indonesia,
Singapore, and South Korea]{.underline}.75

### 2AC -- Not Revisionist

#### "Chinese revisionism" [oversimplifies]{.underline}, prefer an analysis of [all factors]{.underline}.

Rahul **Jaybhay 20**, Master\'s student in Politics and International
Studies at School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University,
New Delhi, "Why is China "still" not a revisionist power?"
<https://thekootneeti.in/2020/04/24/why-is-china-stil-not-a-revisionist-power/>
//lenox

The parameters to test whether China is altering the military order
include -- distribution of power and territorial disputes. [Distribution
of power measures whether China has "[extraordinary growth in military
expenditures](https://doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2014.932160)" and whether
such military expenditures affect the]{.underline} **[balance of
power]{.underline}** (BoP) in the South-East Asian region. Official
[estimates suggest that]{.underline} [[Chinese military
expenditures](https://doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2014.932160) "multiplied
by almost 12 times]{.underline} in nominal terms between 1994 and 2012
-- a double-digit annual growth rate". [But in **sharp contrast**, for
nearly a decade (2009-2017) Chinese military expenditures]{.underline}
[[remained at](https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2018.1558056) "[1.9
percent of Chinese
GDP](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex)]{.underline}". This suggests
[in recent times Chinese expenditure has **relatively
softened**]{.underline}, but not absolutely. Moreover, [China is
financing much more **defensive** capabilities, **rather** than
offensive capabilities]{.underline}. [US "[offensive defence"
strategy](https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2019.1693103) has compelled
China to invest heavily in **A2/AD** defensive capabilities to **deter**
American aggression]{.underline}. In short, China is defensively
balancing against American offence in the East Asian region. In response
to China's growth, most of the countries in the Southeast Asian region
have [increased their defense
budget](https://doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2014.932160). This suggests
regional BoP is heavily skewed towards defence while measuring
offence-defence balance. To conclude as [Michael Beckley puts
it](https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00294) "[balance of power will remain
**stable** for years to come]{.underline}" in the region. Regarding
territorial disputes, we assess the issue of sovereignty of Taiwan, past
disputes in the South China Sea and its outcome. China lacks actual
control over Taiwan and won't accept its formal independence. But [the
accusation that China is violating the]{.underline} [["norm of
self-determination" is
**misconstrued**]{.underline}](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4137603.pdf?casa_token=Yxbp6ra24hEAAAAA:1ZZEEMiBLDy27aP8CaI2lbSTFjyEoFPNKaR4CCzv8WgX8na6DUfa8fufCf0VRF4pkHNKCdgJ_tC1gqxuqiKpdhYq6eCMs4kfRRywpq1QjGsYpHAihiHipQ).
UN [documents on decolonization and national liberation in the
1960s]{.underline} acknowledged the right of oppressed people to set up
their own sovereign state, but "it also [attempted to **protect** newly
independent, decolonized states from further
dismemberment]{.underline}". China's case is similar to other countries
like India, thus [any conclusion based on this fact is
**incomplete**]{.underline}. At this moment, China's coercive diplomacy
in the South China Sea is getting a lot of attention. But such [coercive
measures are evident in the **past** also]{.underline} ([such behaviour
is observed in **any states** involved in territorial
disputes]{.underline}). In the 1970s to 1990s China used its naval power
" [to violently push other claimants
off](https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00360) " the " territorial features
(Parcels 1974, Johnson South reef 1988) and established a new presence
on "Mischief reef in 1990s". [China enhanced its military and naval
presence]{.underline} in the South China sea in 2009 and 2010, [as a
**response** to more assertive "[proactive
diplomacy](http://www.dragon-report.com/Dragon_Report/home/home_files/ISEC_a_00115.pdf)
by other claimants to establish legal boundaries]{.underline} of their
claims". Similarly, in 2012 [when Japan nationalized Senkaku
islands]{.underline} (disputed territory between China and Japan),
[China responded with the coast guard to "[**symbolically challenge**
Japan's control](https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00360)]{.underline}".
Moreover, when Japan [extended its
ADIZ](https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2018.1558056) to monitor control
over Senkaku, China responded with its own ADIZ move. Regionally, China
has taken unilateral action to resolve the existing disputes, even
though it neglected the judgement given by the international arbitration
tribunal in 2016 challenging the UN Convention on the Law of Sea to
resolve disputes. In short, since the past three decades China is
actively present in the South China Sea, thus [claims that China is
"more assertive" in the region, at this moment, is simply
**exaggerated**]{.underline}. Moreover, China in the above two cases
responded to the actions of other claimants to establish control over
disputed territory. Thus [revisionist tendencies are seen **only when
China is provoked**]{.underline}. Politico-economic order The parameters
to test whether China is revising the politico-economic order include --
first cooperation with the hegemon (US), second China's approach to
various international institutions. Cooperation with the hegemon
measures cooperative actions over a range of issues and voting
congruence in the UN. [Cooperative actions and congruence in multiple
issues between the US and China are measured with the help of the
dataset provided by the Integrated Crisis Early Warning
System]{.underline} (ICEWS -- (Fig 1 below)). Contrary to the current
narrative where China is projected as more assertive, [Chinese
statements and actions towards the US are "**overwhelmingly
cooperative**"]{.underline}. The second measure is the degree of voting
congruence between the US and China. This is measured through UNGA ideal
point data (Fig 2 below) which captures China's position vis-a-vis the
US. The absolute distance between the US and China's ideal points varied
across time, but as compared to the 1990s, the gap in 2015 has narrowed.
[China's approach to international institutions includes]{.underline}
first, China's [participation rate in international institutions
and]{.underline} second [whether China challenges or breaks the rules
and norms of such institutions]{.underline}. Between the 1960s and
1990s, [Chinese membership to international organizations **jumped**
from zero to 80 percent of compared states]{.underline}. Some
international organizations like IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO are
supported by both the US and China, while other institutions are more or
less opposed by both including ICJ, ICC. Most importantly, the [common
method to check a state's compliance with international organizations is
to compare that state's approach to the US]{.underline}. But [the US has
**consistently opposed** the rules and norms of international
order]{.underline}. For instance, [China's rejection to comply with the
decision of the International arbitration tribunal in 2016 concerning
the South China Sea dispute is regarded as violative of an international
norm, then why not the US **invasion of Iraq** in 2003 and its
**adventure in Afghanistan**]{.underline}. As regards, institutions such
as UNSC, [China remains a **staunch** defender of it]{.underline}.
[China has contributed to the **peacemaking** mission at the behest of
the UN. China is currently involved in major **arms control
institutions**]{.underline}. But both China and the US remained outside
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and opposed the Treaty of
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. In short, as Steve Chan concluded,
participation in IGO's reflects national satisfaction with the world
order, though the evidence regarding the breaking of rules and norms
remains contested (should be analyzed relative to other states' response
to international institutions). Conclusion To sum up, the above pieces
of evidence suggest that [the "revisionist" narrative is much more
**exaggerated** and **overstated**]{.underline}. In some domains,
China's assertiveness, to some degree, has increased, but in other
domains, it remained satisfied with other liberal orders. In other
words, [the overall picture remains pretty complex and "revisionist
characterization" is simply a **conjecture**]{.underline}.

"Panic of Decline -- Which Is the Revisionist Power, the US or China?",
<https://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/panic-of-decline-which-is-the-revisionist-power/>
//lenox

A [**central premise** of the Biden foreign-policy team is that China is
trying to **challenge** the status quo]{.underline}, which is defined as
US primacy in the world system. China is seen as a rising power with a
huge grudge against the existing international system. In short, it
could be said that there are parallels between the second decade of the
twenty-first century and the early twentieth century, when a democratic
England struggled with a rising, economically powerful but authoritarian
Germany. [This analogy,]{.underline} however[, that of a "**Wilhelmine
China**", is **flawed**: it is hardly obvious, in the year 2021, just
who is defending the status quo]{.underline}. The irony is, [at the
**very moment** of China's decision to **integrate** fully into the
international system, the United States seems to have started the
process of **changing** that system]{.underline}. [It is **abandoning**
the rules it established at the end of the Second World War,
**especially** the liberal international economic order, which was based
on free trade and the mechanism of market competition]{.underline}.
After more than forty years of reform and opening, China is on the verge
of becoming a lead player in the existing international economic system.
[Just as China aspires to become a "**normal state**" for the first time
in its long and self-isolated history, the **criterion for "normal" is
changing**]{.underline}. [When China became **multilateral** in its
foreign relations, America became **unilateral** under the Trump
administration, and this policy has continued under Biden]{.underline}.
[There's **no question** that the **US**, rather than China, is a
leading **revisionist** power today]{.underline}, [because the
Washington establishment of both political parties is trapped in another
**wave of panic**]{.underline}: [the morbid fear of a US
**decline**.]{.underline} How do good times happen? What makes the bad
times come? Why do we fall, and who helps us come back, if anyone can?
Declinism has the same fascination for historians that love has for
romantic poets. The [people who want to set up China as the new monster
are **obliged** to explain why the US is declining]{.underline}.
Ironically, [they **cannot do it convincingly**, since the intellectual
predecessors of the new declinist, Joe Biden, are all declinists,
too]{.underline}. [He has to face insurmountable **logical absurdity**
by insisting that the previous era was actually a peak rather than the
valley]{.underline} that the previous declinists thought were actually
valleys. The popularity of declinism was established in 1918, in the
book that gave decline a profitable name in publishing: the German
historian Oswald Spengler's best-selling work "The Decline of the West".
For many in Washington, Spengler was far-sighted in his pessimism and
attempt to foretell the decline of liberalism in the face of the spread
of totalitarianism. But this is not enough --- they have also to revive
Spenger's racism to justify their animosity toward China. Hence, [the
**Yellow Peril narrative** came in handy for the Trump
administration]{.underline}. [Trumpism is stoking a **fierce racial
war** in the United States and abroad; hostility towards the Yellow
Peril has been kindled **simultaneously**]{.underline}. This is no
accident. [While Trump's China policy was openly racist]{.underline}
(phrases such as "Kung Flu" have certainly been responsible for current
anti-Asian hate crimes), [Biden's China policy is more
subtle.]{.underline} However, [its Yellow Peril undertone is
unmistakable. Since the political elite in Washington are **horrified**
by a crumbling world order built on "unipolar fantasy", it is not
surprising that they are, subconsciously perhaps, seeking inspiration
from Spengler]{.underline}, the guru of the racialist school of decline.
The [combination of declinism and the Yellow Peril narrative produces a
**perfect** rhetorical tool for **China-bashing** today]{.underline}.
Spengler, the original prophet of a declining West, left a horrible
proposition for the Western people over a century ago: if the decline of
the West is caused by its own doing, i.e., internecine wars, then you
have no one to blame. But if the rise of the non-white peoples causes
the West to decline, how should the white world deal with them? Either
by eliminating them or simply retarding the advancement of their
societies. The worst solution, according to Spengler, is to 'integrate'
them. The America Firsters have peddled this message loud and clear.
Nazi Germany chose to eliminate an entire ethnic group, while the US
prefers to return to the idea of economic retardation and launch a
military chokehold against the most advanced non-white country, China.
Not by accident, Spengler also provided a handy theory for technological
"decoupling" with China. He vehemently opposed technological advances in
general, for fear of non-White people getting hold of them to destroy
Western civilisation. More importantly, the China-bashing campaign is
shrouded in a moralistic halo. Despite the volumes of Western books that
have been written on Chinese foreign policy, a [serious study of the
conceptual history of China's foreign relations has **barely
begun**]{.underline}. The [US administration fails to understand the
fact that the meaning of Chinese foreign relations can only be grasped
in a specific Chinese context of **political legitimacy, not** through
some **universal principles** that allegedly guide the international
behaviour of states]{.underline}. Confucian culture stresses that
endogenous factors dictate the rise and decay of a state system, based
on moral standards. Traditionally, [Chinese do not believe that a
regime's legitimacy can be **enhanced** through the
**expansion**]{.underline} of the Mandate of Heaven [into an outer
sphere beyond Chinese culture, either through the **conquest** of
outlying territories, or **legitimate states** inhabited by
non-Chinese]{.underline}. [Foreign adventure and territorial expansion
for resettlement purposes had **never occurred** to Chinese rulers as an
**effective** medicine to cure immanent moral illnesses that
**inevitably give rise** to political chaos at home]{.underline}. The
[non-expansionist attitude **contrasts sharply** with the persistent
missionary zeal in the Christian **West**, which at least from the
Crusades onwards, has been obsessed with "spiritual"
promotion]{.underline} (today it is also called democratic promotion) in
faraway foreign lands, often with military force. A traditional
consensus is that, if a morally corrupt system (the US is no exception)
does not undergo serious reforms, it will not be able to sustain itself
for long. Jim Crowism is alive and strong in the US, but it is not the
fault of the Chinese. Even though little morality has been demonstrated
by the recent foreign policies of the United States, not many in
Washington are willing to admit that the US, as a self-appointed moral
leader, faces a major crisis, and that the existing global system, long
characterised by benign US hegemonic control, is in need of fundamental
reforms. If the current US-China tension continues, we are sleepwalking
into 1914.

#### China's obedience to the LIO is equivalent to the US's -- liberal norms would benefit Chinese interests AND reduce the pressure of a unipolar conflicts.

sg

But the [[**distinction** between the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate**[[s']{.underline}]{.mark}** supposed
[**[commitment]{.mark}** to a system of **rules** [and China's]{.mark}
alleged lack thereof [is **misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline} in at least
three ways. First, [[it overlooks the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[[s']{.underline}]{.mark} own
[[willingness to ignore]{.underline}]{.mark}, evade, or rewrite the
[[rules]{.mark} whenever they seem inconvenient.]{.underline} If we are
honest with ourselves, we have to acknowledge that Washington sometimes
thinks it is perfectly okay for might to make right and for winners to
take all. [The collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, when
[[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[took]{.mark} **full
[advantage]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a weakened **post-Soviet
[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is a perfect example.

Second, as Harvard University's Alastair Iain Johnston has shown,
[[China accepts]{.mark} and]{.underline} even [defends]{.underline} many
[**principles** of [the]{.mark} **existing
[order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although of course not all of them. That
situation may change in the future, of course, but even a vastly more
powerful China would undoubtedly seek to retain whatever features of the
present order serve its interests.

Third, statements such as Blinken's imply that abandoning today's
rules-based order would leave us in a lawless, rule-free world of naked
power politics, unregulated by any norms or principles whatsoever. This
is simply not the case: [Scholars]{.underline} of widely varying views
[understand that all international [orders]{.mark}---**global**,
**regional**, **liberal**, **realist**]{.underline}, or
whatever---[require a set of rules]{.underline} to manage the various
interactions that [[**inevitably arise** between different
polities.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Examples can be found throughout the international relations literature:
44 years ago, theorist Hedley Bull defined an "international society" as
"a group of states ... bound by a set of common rules" and the
University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer recently referred to
international orders as "an organized group of international
institutions," which he says "are effectively rules that the great
powers devise and agree to follow." The statesman Henry Kissinger argues
that all world orders rest on a "set of commonly accepted rules" and the
Princeton University professor G. John Ikenberry's many works on the
U.S.-led "liberal" order all emphasize its "rules-based character." The
political scientists Beth Simmons and Hein Goemans agree, writing, "any
intergroup order must be defined by rules of group membership and ...
political authority." Even skeptics of the liberal order, such as the
scholar Patrick Porter, acknowledge the role that rules played within
that system, while emphasizing how the United States has used its
superior power to compel other states to comply with the rules it
prefers.

In short, the issue is not the United States' preference for a
"rules-based" order and China's alleged lack of interest in it; rather,
the issue is who will determine which rules pertain where. Or as the
Rand Corp.'s Michael Mazarr recently put it, "At its core, the United
States and China are competing to shape the foundational global
system---the essential ideas, habits, and expectations that govern
international politics. It is ultimately a competition of norms,
narratives, and legitimacy."

The differences between the American and Chinese conceptions are
relatively straightforward. The United States (generally) prefers a
multilateral system (albeit one with special privileges for some states,
especially itself) that is at least somewhat mindful of individual
rights and certain core liberal values (democratic rule, individual
freedom, rule of law, market-based economies, and so on). These ideals
may be applied imperfectly at home and pursued inconsistently abroad,
but the U.S. commitment to them is not just empty rhetoric. Among other
things, it underpins U.S. efforts to persuade or compel other states to
alter their own domestic arrangements. Not surprisingly, the United
States also likes many existing institutions (the IMF, NATO, the World
Bank, the reserve role of the dollar, to name a few) because they give
the United States greater influence.

By contrast, [[China favors a more **Westphalian**]{.mark}
**conception** of [order]{.mark}]{.underline}, one where state
sovereignty and [noninterference are **paramount**]{.underline} and
[**liberal notions** of **individual rights**]{.underline} are
downplayed if not entirely dismissed. This [[vision is no less
"**rules-based**" than the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate**[[s']{.underline}]{.mark}**, insofar
as it draws on parts of the United Nations charter, [and [it would not
preclude]{.mark} many current forms of **international
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including extensive trade,
investment, [**collaboration** on vital **transnational
issues**]{.underline} such as climate change. [[China
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a]{.mark} vocal [defender of
**multilateralism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if its actual behavior
sometimes violates existing multilateral norms. Nonetheless, a world in
which China's preferences prevailed would be different than one in which
the U.S. vision proved to be more influential.

I don't know which of these two visions will win out in the years ahead,
but a few observations are in order. First, if you think the United
States and its closest allies are going to write all the rules
themselves, think again. International orders inevitably reflect the
underlying balance of power, and China's rise means that its ability to
shape some of the rules (or to refuse to go along with rules that it
rejects) will be considerable.

Second, and following from the first point, no single power can write
and enforce all the rules of an order. The United States got most of
what it wanted during the creation of the Bretton Woods system and had
enormous influence over the subsequent evolution of that order, but it
still had to compromise on a number of issues, and it frequently failed
to get everything it wanted. The United States and China are going to
have a great deal of influence over the rules that emerge either
globally or within whatever partial orders each might lead. But to gain
others' compliance, they will still have to give other states at least
some of what they want, too.

If the United States Doesn't Make The Rules, China Will

Progressives need to learn how to use American market power for good.

Third, [[China's **emergence**]{.underline}]{.mark} (and, to a much
lesser extent, Russia's regional sway) [[gives]{.mark} other [countries
more options than they had]{.mark} during the **unipolar era**.
[**Iran** may be suffering]{.mark} **mightily** under U.S.
**sanctions**[, but its]{.mark}]{.underline} recent oil and [investment
[deal]{.mark} with China [reveals its ability to reduce]{.mark} the
**[pressure]{.mark}** s]{.underline}omewhat [[without]{.mark} making
**additional [concessions]{.mark}** to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Europe may be thrilled to see former U.S.
President Donald Trump gone and delighted by President Joe Biden's
desire to repair trans-Atlantic ties, but that sense of relief hasn't
led Germany to cancel the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, didn't stop the EU
from signing its own investment deal with Beijing despite U.S. requests
for a delay, and isn't going to convince Prime Minister Viktor Orban to
bring liberal values back to Hungary.

#### China is not attempting to undermine [western governance]{.underline} AND doesn't have the [requisite capability]{.underline}. 

Hugh **White 21**, Professor of Strategic Studies in the School of
International, Political & Strategic Studies at the Australian National
University, 8/1/2021, \"China threatens the West's primacy, not its
democratic systems,\"
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-threatens-west-s-primacy-not-its-democratic-systems,
sg

[The first relates to China's **intentions**]{.underline}. As former
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Peter Varghese among
others has argued, there is no evidence that Beijing seeks to remodel
the world in its image. China is not like the Soviet Union in its
heyday, which really did aim to make the world communist. [[The **CCP**
will do whatever it can to **protect its**]{.mark} **own
[system]{.mark}**]{.underline} from being undermined from without, but
unlike the Soviet Union -- and many in the West -- it does not seem to
believe that this requires the rest of the world to adopt its model.

But [[**intentions** can **change**]{.mark}, so the **stronger reason**
to doubt the Cold War view of our contest with China relates to its
capabilities]{.underline}. Even if Beijing does seek to undermine
democracy around the world, is there any reason to think it might
succeed? Here again, [the contrast with the Soviet Union is
**instructive**.]{.underline}

Take the contest of ideas. It is hard now to remember that during the
early post-war decades, the [Soviet Union offered a fully-developed and
**comprehensive** vision of **global order**]{.underline}, national
organisation and human life that many people, [both in the West and in
the **decolonising** "**third world**", found compelling]{.underline}.
Moscow-affiliated communist parties were significant players in the
domestic politics of many countries, including key US allies such as
France, Italy and Japan. It is now clear that the challenge this posed
to liberal democracy was weaker than it seemed, but the challenge was
nonetheless real.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's recent keynote address at the
Perth USAsia Centre, ahead of the G7 Summit, included a call for liberal
democracies to be "stepping up with coordinated action" (Matt
Jelonek/Getty Images)

There is no analogy with China today. [[In no]{.mark} **western
[country]{.mark}** [does anyone advocate the adoption of China's]{.mark}
political [system]{.mark}]{.underline} or the acceptance of a
Chinese-led global order, and while many leaders in the developing world
may long to copy the CCP's political and economic achievements, few if
any acknowledge it as an ideological model or would welcome its
hegemony. [Even [countries]{.mark} that share **China's
ideology**]{.underline} -- such as Vietnam -- [[resist its
**influence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So even if China were trying to
impose its brand of politics on others by persuasion, it has no evidence
that it has the capacity to do so

The second reason [[China doesn't pose the threat]{.mark} it appears to,
relates to material power]{.underline}. At first glance, [it may seem
that China is much better placed **materially**]{.underline} than the
Soviets were to "rule the world". Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet
Union had the world's second-biggest economy, but it was never more than
half the size of America's. China's GDP has already overtaken America's
in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms and is poised to do so in market
exchange rate terms before long, and will most likely outstrip it in the
decades ahead. Beijing might therefore seem to have the material basis
for global hegemony that the Soviet Union lacked.

[But the **comparison**]{.underline} with America [isn't what really
counts anymore]{.underline}. In the Cold War, especially in its early
stages, [[wealth and power were very **unevenly distributed**]{.mark}
around the world]{.underline}, and America and the Soviet Union were
overwhelmingly preponderant. They were the only two countries that
counted strategically, which is why they were called superpowers.

Some people may think that it doesn't matter much to exaggerate China's
threat if that helps mobilise support against it.

To see what this meant, consider the position of the Soviet Union across
Eurasia 70 years ago in 1951, when the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) had been recently founded. Eastern Europe was
already under its control. Western Europe and Japan were still in ruins.
India was only just independent, desperately poor and happy to lean
Moscow's way. China was a communist satellite, and Southeast Asia seemed
set to follow. And the Soviets were the only Eurasian power with nuclear
weapons. There was no serious barrier to Soviet hegemony over the whole
of Eurasia, except America.

Compare China's position today, when power is much more evenly
distributed around the world. Russia, India and Europe are all
substantial powers, and [[**China** has no chance of subjugating
**Eurasia**]{.mark} by dominating them. And if China cannot dominate
them, [it certainly can't challenge]{.mark} **America** in [the
**Western hemisphere**]{.mark}, or "rule the world".]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Relations

#### Low relations don't cause war -- [mutually beneficial]{.underline} relationships AND [low hostility]{.underline} disprove motivation for war.

Graham [[Allison]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} April 12 [article]{.underline},
"How America and China Could Stumble to War," [explores how
**misperceptions** and **bureaucratic dysfunction** could accelerate a
**militarized crisis** involving the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and China into an **unwanted
war**]{.underline}. However, the [article]{.underline} fails to persuade
because it [[neglects the key **political**]{.mark} and **geostrategic**
[conditions that make war plausible]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first
place. Without those conditions in place, the risk that a crisis could
accidentally escalate into war becomes far lower. The [U.S.-China
[relationship]{.mark} today [may be trending towards]{.mark} **greater
[tension]{.mark}**[, but the]{.mark} **relative [stability]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} overall [**[low]{.mark} level of
[hostility]{.mark}** [make]{.mark} the prospect of an accidental
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} to war [**extremely
[unlikely]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In a series of scenarios centered around the South China Sea, Taiwan and
the East China Sea, Allison explored how well-established flashpoints
involving China and the United States and its allies could spiral into
unwanted war. Allison\'s article argues that given the context of
strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power,
organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of
unintended escalation. According to Allison, "the underlying stress
created by China\'s disruptive rise creates conditions in which
accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a large-scale
conflict." This argument appears persuasive on its surface, in no small
part because it evokes insights from some of Allison\'s groundbreaking
work on the organizational pathologies that made the Cuban Missile
Crisis so dangerous.

However, [Allison]{.underline} ultimately fails to persuade because he
[fails to specify the political and **strategic conditions** that make
war plausible]{.underline} in the first place. Allison\'s analysis
implies that the United States and China are in a situation analogous to
that of the Soviet Union and the United States in the early 1960s. In
the Cold War example, the two countries faced each other on a near-war
footing and engaged in a bitter geostrategic and ideological struggle
for supremacy. The two countries experienced a series of militarized
crises and fought each other repeatedly through proxy wars. It was this
broader context that made issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a
crisis.

Neither Washington nor Beijing regards the other as its principal enemy.

By contrast, the [U.S.-China relationship]{.underline} today [operates
at a much **lower level** of hostility]{.underline} and threat. [China
and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may be
experiencing an **increase** in tensions, but the [two countries
remain]{.mark} [far from]{.mark} the [bitter]{.mark}, **acrimonious
[rivalry]{.mark}**]{.underline} that defined the U.S.-Soviet
relationship in the early 1960s. [Neither Washington nor Beijing regards
the other as its **principal enemy**.]{.underline} Today\'s rivals may
view each other warily as competitors and threats on some issues, but
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[view each other as]{.mark} important
**[trade partners]{.mark}**]{.underline} and partners on some shared
concerns, such as North Korea, as the recent summit between President
Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping illustrated. The
[[behavior of their]{.mark} **respective [militaries]{.mark}**
[underscores]{.mark} the relatively **[restrained
rivalry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [military
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between China and the United States
[may be growing, but it [operates at a]{.mark} far **[lower
level]{.mark} of intensity** [than]{.mark} the relentless **[arms
racing]{.mark}** that typified the **U.S.-Soviet
standoff**]{.underline}. And unlike their Cold War counterparts, U.S.
and Chinese militaries are not postured to fight each other in major
wars. Moreover, polls show that the people of the two countries regard
each other with mixed views---a considerable contrast from the hostile
sentiment expressed by the U.S. and Soviet publics for each other.
[[Lacking]{.mark} both **[preparations]{.mark}** for major war [and a
**constituency**]{.mark} for conflict, **[leaders]{.mark}** and
**bureaucracies**]{.underline} in both countries [[have **less
incentive**]{.mark} to misjudge **crisis situations**]{.underline} in
favor of unwarranted escalation.

### 2AC -- Russia-China Alliance 

#### No China-Russia alliance -- identity and border disputes outweigh regional security concerns

Relations. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham. 2022

Lack of Regional Integration: Explanations and Examples If Chinese
exhortations about "win--win" cooperation on the regional level fall
flat, it is because [China and Russia lack a shared sense of regional
identity]{.underline}, [leading to **incompatible
security**]{.underline} **[interests,]{.underline}** at least where
identity issues are concerned. This means that [even projects that
provide mutual benefit may raise challenges to Russia's
identity]{.underline}, [undermining its commitment to regional
integration]{.underline} (Russo and Stoddard 2018, 34). Jennifer Mitzen
argues that [states seek **identity security, not** just **physical
security**]{.underline}. In fact, Mitzen argues that [states may be
willing to forego cooperation and tolerate interstate conflict if the
price is greater stability in their identity]{.underline} (Mitzen 2016,
342). Security dilemmas may emerge when a group's action, taken to
secure its identity, cause a reaction in another group, thereby
resulting in the insecurity of both (Olesker 2011, 382).

The Sino-Russian Border Regions While Chinese officials and experts may
be frustrated by what they call "China threat" views---regarding their
country's purported intentions to take over neighboring lands and
encourage migration there, [China,]{.underline} too, [has its own
identity concerns with respect to its neighbors]{.underline} on the
Steppe. [Historians explain]{.underline} how [China's identity was
formed in opposition to these neighbors]{.underline} who are portrayed
as starkly different, despite commonalities (MacKay 2016, 472--473). In
the neighboring countries, [narratives of history and memories of border
displacements]{.underline} [**create dissonance** with Chinese
interpretations]{.underline} and underlie suspicions of China's current
intentions.

[For Russia, identity is rooted in a geopolitical space]{.underline}, a
conceptualization [that has led to misunderstandings with]{.underline}
the EU and its conception of borderless Europe (Akchurina and Della Sala
2018, 1651) as well as with [China.]{.underline} Place names became
flashpoints in relations with China, as [residents of the Russian Far
East see territorial ambitions in the persistence in China of Qing era
names for Russian cities]{.underline} (Wishnick 2014, 54).5
[Border]{.underline} demarcation [agreements]{.underline}, which
involved some give and take of territory, [were negotiated]{.underline}
and announced **[with little transparency]{.underline}** in all involved
countries, [fueling suspicions, heightened by widespread
corruption]{.underline} in China and its neighbors.

The changes in China's borders with Kazakhstan and Russia in the
nineteenth century reflect China's declining fortunes in the Qing
dynasty.The codification of these borders in twentieth-century border
demarcation agreements, as China began its resurgence, represent a
necessary but bitter pill for Chinese leaders. As S.C.M. Paine points
out, the SinoRussian border represents for China "the failure to fend
off the predations of European civilization" (Paine 1996, 9). Russians,
in particular, question whether Chinese leaders have ever abandoned the
hope of retrieving territories lost in the Qing era. Deng Xiaoping told
Gorbachev in their historic meeting in 1989 that they must "close the
past and open the future," but in a less quoted passage, he went on to
discuss the unequal treaties that support the relationship he just
agreed to normalize.

[Deng]{.underline} Xiaoping: Now I would like to express my thoughts on
two issues: first, to touch on the question of the losses, inflicted on
China by a number of powers, and, second, to say from where China was
threatened in the last thirty years.

Then \[Deng Xiaoping\] named, among countries who inflicted damage on
China, first and foremost Great Britain and Portugal, because they first
occupied the Chinese territory, created concessions, captured Aomen
(Macao). He [spoke at length about the losses inflicted by]{.underline}
Japan, **[tsarist Russia]{.underline}**, [which obtained the largest
gain from China]{.underline}, [and about the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
With this [he had in mind that Russia]{.underline}, up until the October
revolution, [had a sphere of influence in Northeastern
China]{.underline}, centered on Harbin. [And]{.underline} in general,
\[Deng Xiaoping\] stressed, Russia, through unequal treaties, [received
more than 1.5 million square kilometers of Chinese
territory]{.underline}. And already after the October revolution, in
1929, the Soviet Union captured the islands on the Amur and Ussuri
rivers near Khabarovsk\]\... (www.wil soncenter.org n.d.)

In this statement, [Deng highlights]{.underline} the importance of
[Chinese territorial integrity]{.underline}, which succession of Chinese
leaders have since identified [as a "**core" nationalist
interest**]{.underline}. At the same time, over the past several
decades, Chinese officials also have sought to promote various
cross-border integration schemes, most recently under the framework of
the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In this situation, China promotes a
vision of borders as bridges (Foot 2016, 5). Instead of insisting on
borders as fixed barriers, protecting the national interest, the BRI,
for example, promotes a more fluid vision of a transnational space
involving civilizational, rather than interstate, connections. (Summers
2020, 812; Grant 2018, 400). It is [the latter]{.underline} that
**[worries Russia.]{.underline}**

COVID-19 and Sino-Russian Relations [COVID-19 has highlighted the anemic
state of Sino-Russian cross-border exchanges]{.underline}.
(chinasresourcerisks.com 2021) Although [Russia and China share a 4000
km shared border, there were relatively few cases of COVID19 in the
Russian border regions in the first few months of the
pandemic]{.underline}, [attesting to the overall **weakness** of
Sino-Russian **regional relations**]{.underline}, rather than to the
effectiveness of Russian public health measures. Indeed, the virus
appears to have traveled more circuitously to Russia from China to
Europe and then to European regions within Russia (Zuenko 2020). The
Russian government closed the land border with China on January 30th,
2020, followed by border crossing points (February 1) and rail traffic
(February 3). As of September 2021, the Sino-Russian border is still
only open to cargo.

In bilateral talks, Putin and Xi Jinping have expressed mutual support
and pledged to cooperate against the pandemic (Weitz 2020) but
[reactions across Russia's regions were mixed]{.underline}. [Some
Russian regions bemoaned the loss of Chinese visitors]{.underline}
(meduza.io 2020) [while others]{.underline} quarantined them or
[monitored them using facial recognition]{.underline} technology,
[prompting protests of **ethnic profiling**]{.underline} (Light 2020;
Sixth Tone 2020). A February 2020 poll by Ipsos-MORI found that 37% of
Russians polled said they would avoid individuals with a Chinese
appearance (Beaver 2020). Once the pandemic was under control in China
later in the spring of 2020, this time it was the Chinese government
that shut down border crossing points on its own side of the border.
This move ended up stranding Chinese nationals seeking to return home
and created new health risks for the Russian Far East, where infected
visitors faced 28-day quarantines (Shah 2020).

Although most experts argue that the pandemic was most likely
transmitted by a bat to a wild animal sold in China (McKay et al. 2021)
[in an effort to raise questions about the pandemic's
origin]{.underline} in China, [Chinese officials have claimed that the
virus can be transmitted by frozen food]{.underline}, [including fish
from Russia]{.underline} (as well as Maine lobsters!) (Hernández
2021/Woodcock 2021). Since approximately 60% of Russian fish, mostly
from the Russian Far East (Russian primamedia.ru 2021) is exported to
China, this has crippled Russian fish exports. China has refused to
accept imported Russian fish since COVID-19 traces were found on frozen
fish imported from Russia to Jilin, China. This has forced Russian fish
exporters to seek out other markets in Southeast Asia and even in
Africa, as officials try to negotiate an end to the Chinese ban
(Solovieva 2021). [China's eagerness to uncover a foreign origin for the
pandemic has created a new irritant in Sino-Russian regional
relations]{.underline}, always the weakest link in their partnership.

[Another day, another **warning**]{.underline} from the West [about
China's **upcoming invasion** of Taiwan]{.underline}. That has been the
pattern ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February. It's
really not about China learning the right or wrong lesson from Russia's
invasion, but for [**Western [pundits]{.mark}** making this **improbable
warning** [to learn some]{.mark} **military
[basics]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

If you don't like reading war books, at least watch the opening
harrowing scenes of Saving Private Ryan. In general, there is a world of
difference between a land invasion and one by sea. In particular, the
[island [chains]{.mark} and the **main island** of Taiwan
[present]{.mark} formidable [defences against an invasion force]{.mark},
as opposed to a **land invasion** across Ukraine]{.underline} borders.

There is a world of difference between a land invasion and one by sea

Here are some random samplings of Western paranoia. These two are recent
op-eds from Bloomberg: "China May Be Learning the Wrong Lessons from
Ukraine: Could Russia inspire its ally to launch an invasion of its
own?" and "Putin's Struggles in Ukraine May Embolden Xi on Taiwan".

This is a full editorial from The Economist: "How to deter China from
attacking Taiwan: What Taiwan can learn from Ukraine about resisting
invasion". Top United States officials have repeatedly warned China not
to support Russia to breach sanctions and not to invade Taiwan, even
though Beijing is doing neither. Here's a recent one from Secretary of
the Treasury Janet Yellen before the House Financial Services Committee,
who said all sanctions tools would be used against China if Beijing
moved aggressively against Taiwan.

All these specious warnings remind me of those [same **supercilious
Western pundits** who predicted Beijing would roll in the tanks in 2019
during the violent **anti-government** unrest]{.underline} in Hong Kong
[for **Tiananmen 2.0.**]{.underline}

Of course, [[China has made it clear that except for]{.mark} an outright
**declaration of [independence]{.mark}**]{.underline} by Taiwan, [all
other disputes or [conflicts must be resolved
peacefully]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has been both a promise and a
threat; I see no reason to doubt Beijing's sincerity. It really doesn't
want to fight Taiwan, but all bets are off when it comes to
independence.

Vladimir Putin and his generals were lured into a false sense of
security because of the ease with which their soldiers could cross into
Ukraine. [**Chinese [leaders]{.mark}** and their generals know the cost
of [an invasion]{.mark} across the Taiwan Strait [would be
**horrendous**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if successful.

Armchair pundits pontificate on grand strategies; real soldiers fret
about logistics. [It's much more [difficult to move a
**massive**]{.mark} **[army]{.mark}** and **equipment** [across]{.mark}
a body of water than across land.]{.underline} That's what political
scientist John [Mearsheimer calls "[the **stopping power** of
water]{.mark}"]{.underline}. At its narrowest point, the Taiwan Strait
is 128km between the mainland and the main island of Taiwan. But landing
distances will be considerably greater as much of the invasion force
would not be able to embark at that narrow point.

Again, think of Saving Private Ryan. The [Taiwan [Strait is]{.mark} four
times [wider than the]{.mark} **English [Channel]{.mark}**[,
across]{.mark} which **Operation Overlord** on [D-Day]{.mark} was
launched.]{.underline} [The entire world would be alerted
weeks]{.underline} if not months [ahead of time in the amassing of such
a large **Chinese army**]{.underline} and equipment, especially after
the experience with the Russian preparation for the war in Ukraine.
[[There could be **no**]{.mark} **element of [surprise]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} mainland [China]{.underline}.

It has been pointed out that at least [two chains of more than **100
[islands]{.mark}**]{.underline} and islets [[offer]{.mark} ample
[opportunities for]{.mark} Taiwan forces to **lay [traps]{.mark}**
before the mainland forces]{.underline} even [reach Taiwan]{.underline}
proper. And of course, the [**main [island]{.mark}** [offers]{.mark}
**formidable** [natural and urban **terrains** for
defence]{.mark}]{.underline} against an invader. It would be no easy
matter for invading forces to capture Taichung in the centre, Kaohsiung
in the south and [[Taipei]{.underline}]{.mark} in the north, each of
which [[could]{.mark} easily [turn into]{.mark} **another
[Stalingrad]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In fact, the three main cities would
each form a hub of defence, much like Kyiv whose success in repelling
Russian forces has astonished the world.

But the real reason for Beijing's reluctance to take Taiwan by force is
not military, but geopolitical. While [[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the
"**prestige prize**]{.underline}" for its national unification value[,
it [is not the **real prize**]{.mark}.]{.underline} China's future as a
dominant regional power does not depend on the status of Taiwan, but
rather dominance or at least greater control of the South China Sea.
[[Attacking Taiwan would **imperil** the]{.mark} whole [project]{.mark}
that has been decades in the making for those waters.]{.underline}

Short of the unconditional imperative of reversing Taiwan's outright
independence[, attacking the island would not only be **fratricide**,
but **suicide**.]{.underline}

#### China lacks the [logistical]{.underline} and [naval capabilities]{.underline} for an invasion -- prefer [war college calculations]{.underline}.

The [**definitive document** on what size force would be required to
seize Taiwan]{.underline} in a full-out landing [was drafted by the US
military]{.underline} in the late stages of World War II in the Pacific.
In 1944, Operation Causeway was the US plan for retaking Formosa, as it
was then called, from 30,000 starving Japanese soldiers. The planned
invasion force was double the size of Operation Overlord, the Normandy
landing: 400,000 soldiers and marines deployed on 4,000 ships. [[With
a]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [defending [force of 450,000
Taiwanese]{.mark}]{.underline} today, [[using the]{.mark} traditional
**[three-to-one ratio]{.mark}** of attackers to defenders [taught at
**war colleges**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [China would
need]{.underline}]{.mark} [to deploy over **[1.2 million
soldiers]{.mark}** (out of]{.underline} a total active force of over [2
million). Many thousands of ships would be required to land all those
forces,]{.underline} and doing so would take weeks. How many occupation
forces would be required to pacify the Taiwanese? Surely the [[lessons
of **Afghanistan** and **Iraq** are not lost]{.mark} on the
PLA]{.underline} leadership.

[[China possesses a **small fraction** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
necessary [[ships]{.mark} to execute a landing]{.underline} of that size
[[and lacks]{.mark} the capacity to do so for the]{.underline}
foreseeable [**future**. Nor are there any current plans suggesting
China is [intent on procuring such a force]{.mark}]{.underline}, though
that could change.

Further, [Taiwan is not **conducive** to]{.underline} any form of
**[amphibious assault]{.underline}**. A handful of [[landing
sites]{.mark} on the west coast [are blocked]{.mark}
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} proximate [**[mountain]{.mark}ou[s]{.mark}
areas** running the length of the 250-mile-long island]{.underline},
some approaching 10,000 feet in height. [[Defenders could fall back
using]{.mark} this **difficult terrain** to wage a **[guerrilla
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[Taiwan lacks]{.mark} the
[**infrastructure** to support]{.mark} over a million invaders and their
**[logistical needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, most of which would have to
come from the mainland.

[China Is Not Russia]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.mark} under Putin has **repeatedly [dispatched]{.mark}** its
armed [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} for combat missions
**[[overseas]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a range of countries, including
Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, as well as conducted major military
interventions against other states, most recently Kazakhstan (albeit at
the invitation of that country's president). [Moscow has also actively
supported **armed groups** and **militias**]{.underline} in some of
these same countries and others.

Although [China has also been active]{.underline} and assertive in the
use of its armed forces beyond its borders in recent years, [[Beijing
has]{.mark} [eschewed **large**]{.mark}**-scale combat
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Around its periphery,
[China has engaged in **provocations**]{.underline}, confrontations and
even violent clashes. [But [China]{.mark}, unlike Russia, [has refrained
from]{.mark} **massive [interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, invasions
or occupations of other countries since it invaded Vietnam in 1979.
[China's [largest deployments]{.mark} of troops]{.underline} overseas in
the post-Cold War era [[have been on]{.mark} **U.N.
[Peacekeeping]{.mark}** [missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas [Russia
has more than 20 **military installations** beyond its
borders]{.underline}, to date, [[China has only one]{.underline}]{.mark}
official [**[military base]{.mark}** on **foreign soil**]{.underline}
--- in Djibouti (established in 2017) --- and a handful of other
facilities it does not formally acknowledge.

Of course, Beijing has a history of using its potent armed forces and
muscular coercive apparatus within China's borders to repress vigorously
peaceful protesters, political dissidents and disaffected ethnic
minority peoples. The locations of these operations include Beijing,
Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as Hong Kong. China has also not hesitated
to employ armed force and a wide array of coercive instruments around
its periphery. This includes building roads and bunkers in remote
frontier areas of the high Himalayas along its contested border with
India and constructing artificial islands and military installations in
disputed waters of the South China Sea. In recent years, China's armed
forces have also engaged in deadly clashes and violent confrontations
with Indian army units along the disputed Line of Actual Control and
harassed and rammed the fishing boats and coast guard vessels of
Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries.

Putin appears to relish projecting the image of a strongman who is
routinely willing to thumb his nose at the rest of the world. By
contrast, Xi --- at least to date --- has mainly sought to cultivate a
statesmanlike image on the global stage. At times he has given speeches
attempting to cast China as a more responsible, less meddlesome and
values-free version of the United States. And Xi has invested a lot of
time and resources in promoting a set of high-profile international
efforts intended to demonstrate that China is a constructive and
proactive great power. Employing positive rhetoric touting "win-win"
solutions and aspirations to build a "community with a shared future for
mankind," China under Xi's leadership has launched ambitious efforts
such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.

Putin, by contrast, has made no real effort to offer an alternative to
U.S. global leadership beyond delivering vague grandiose declarations
(often in tandem with Xi) and has offered the world little in the way of
economic stimulus beyond the prospect of more energy exports and hype
about the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Despite consisting of only a
handful of Soviet successor states, the EAEU is touted as Russia's
answer to China's BRI. In terms of geostrategic activism, Russia's major
multilateralist initiatives have tended to involve China. These include
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and
the formation of the BRICS grouping in 2010. The former is a security
community with a Central Asian focus consisting of Russia, China and
four Central and two South Asian states. The latter is a loose
association of some of the world's largest "emerging economies": Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa.

However, Moscow's most significant geostrategic maneuver under Putin has
been to strengthen Russia's strategic partnership with China. Both
Beijing and Moscow insist that their relationship is not an alliance and
their 2001 treaty of friendship --- which was renewed in 2021 --- does
not commit either signatory to come to the defense of the other in case
of military conflict. Yet, the Sino-Russian relationship is a clearly
consequential alignment that has grown closer in recent years,
particularly as their respective relationships with the United States
have deteriorated.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a very uncomfortable
position: Beijing does not want to antagonize Moscow but neither does it
want to damage its relations with Washington and European capitals.
Consequently, China has equivocated in its statements and actions.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for peace but has stopped
short of condemning Russia or calling upon Moscow to withdraw its
military. The lengthy joint statement of February 4, 2022, issued by
Putin and Xi during the Russian leader's visit to Beijing on the eve of
the Winter Olympics, makes no mention at all of Ukraine --- and China
has pointedly abstained on all U.N. Security Council resolutions related
to Russia's invasion. Xi appears to have asked Putin to delay any
military action against Ukraine until after the Olympics.

Russia's invasion poses other difficulties for China both in terms of
running counter to Beijing's long espoused principles in foreign affairs
and its adverse impact on China's national interests in Ukraine.
Russia's actions clearly contradict China's cornerstone foreign policy
principles of noninterference in other countries' affairs and respecting
territorial integrity. Moreover, China has sizable economic investments
in Ukraine and is a good customer of Ukraine's armaments industry. In
2020, Ukraine signed the BRI cooperation agreement, which further
bolstered the economic relationship between the two countries and marked
Ukraine as an important partner in Beijing's signature foreign policy
and economic initiative.

[Taiwan Is Not Ukraine]{.underline}

The fact that [Ukraine is not a member of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO) was]{.mark} almost certainly
[a]{.mark} **decisive [factor]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **Putin's
[calculus]{.mark}** [to invade Ukraine. Russia]{.mark}'s
commander]{.underline} in chief [[knew that]{.mark} his **invading
[forces]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} likely [not have to contend]{.mark}
with the **militaries** of any [other]{.mark}
countrie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if there were any lingering doubts
in the Kremlin about the disposition of the most powerful member of
NATO, U.S. President Joe [Biden stated publicly that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would not send
**military forces** to help]{.underline} defend [Ukraine]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, the Biden administration has taken strong steps to
reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and provide robust military
assistance to Ukraine.

By contrast, [[Xi]{.mark} and his]{.underline} Politburo [colleagues
have]{.underline} long [been [convinced that Taiwan has the]{.mark}
resolute [support of the world's most **capable
military**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The People's Liberation Army --- as all
branches of China's armed forces are known --- continues to assume that
if it launches an invasion of Taiwan, [[the U.S.]{.mark} military
[will]{.mark} **swiftly** and **decisively**
[intervene]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S.-Taiwan relationship, while
technically "unofficial" due to the One China policy, has strengthened
in recent years. On February 28, the Biden administration sent an
unofficial delegation of former U.S. defense and national security
officials to Taiwan as a signal to China of that commitment. It remains
true that the greatest deterrence to a massive Chinese military attack
on the island is Beijing's assumption that war with Taiwan also means a
war with the United States.

However, there is no formal military alliance between the United States
and Taiwan. The defense pact binding Washington to Taipei was formally
abrogated in 1979. So [why is Beijing convinced that Washington has an
**ironclad alliance**-like relationship with Taiwan]{.underline}? There
are at least two reasons. [First, **[successive]{.mark}** U.S.
[administrations have]{.mark} **publicly
[committed]{.mark}**]{.underline} themselves [[to]{.mark} support
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} against Chinese aggression [and have
regularly sold **arms** to the island's armed forces]{.underline}.
[Second]{.underline}, although there is no language in the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA) that explicitly commits the United States to come to
Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack on the island by China, [many
in Washington believe that such a commitment exists]{.underline}. While
there are different interpretations as to what the TRA means, the most
significant fact is that the vast majority of [U.S. **political** and
**military** [leaders are]{.mark} fully [convinced]{.mark} that this
[legislation binds the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} a **de
facto alliance** with [Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Science from Sungkyunkwan University and MA in Political Science from
Yonsei University; "Nuclear balance and the initiation of nuclear
crises: Does superiority matter?" Journal of Peace Research. May 2022.
doi:10.1177/00223433211067899

Discussion and conclusion [Does achieving nuclear superiority lead to a
reduced risk of nuclear crisis]{.underline}? This article finds that
[there is **no statistical evidence** for this proposition]{.underline}:
a favorable balance of nuclear forces fails to produce the predicted
effect on the probability of the initiation of nuclear crises. These
null results are not artifacts of using a particular measure of the
nuclear balance and a specific model specification; [even after using
alternative model specifications]{.underline} and new indicators of
nuclear superiority [that capture important dimensions of nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} that the total warhead count cannot capture,
[those results remain unaltered]{.underline}. Furthermore, [more
qualified hypotheses that posit the conditional effects of nuclear
superiority also do not find empirical support]{.underline}. By directly
testing a key prediction of the nuclear competition school in a new
empirical context, [this article]{.underline} attempts to shed new light
on the theoretical debate over the political benefits of a superior
nuclear arsenal. Although my article does not conclusively disconfirm
the validity of the nuclear competition school as a whole, it
[encourages researchers to **reconsider** the benefit of **maintaining a
favorable nuclear balance of power**]{.underline}, which has been argued
by the nuclear competition school.

This article also engages with a broader discussion on quantitative
studies on nuclear weapons by acknowledging the importance of improving
empirical measures of important variables. While previous quantitative
studies substantially advanced our knowledge on nuclear weapons, they
are not free from criticisms. For instance, several authors note that
statistical analysis on nuclear weapons must carefully code
theoretically important variables and take into account important issues
such as heterogeneity among cases and the small-N problem (Montgomery &
Sagan, 2009; Gavin, 2014). Others also point out that [**several
findings** of quantitative research on nuclear weapons **are not** as
**reliable** as originally believed]{.underline}, demonstrating the
significant methodological challenges scholars on nuclear security are
facing (Bell, 2016; Winter & Lenine, 2020). Improving our measures of
key variables using various open-source data on nuclear weapons is one
way of addressing those challenges[. By employing multiple measures of
the nuclear balance of power]{.underline}, [this article attempts to
minimize the effect of the imperfect nature of those
measures]{.underline} on the validity of statistical inference.

With mixed evidence regarding the political impact of the nuclear
balance, one of the potentially important questions that future study
can explore is to find conditions under which the balance of nuclear
forces meaningfully shapes the outcomes of the interaction between
nuclear-armed states. Instead of simply asking whether the nuclear
balance matters at all, we could enrich our knowledge about the dynamics
of crises between nuclear-armed states by examining what factors could
potentially influence the effect of military nuclear advantage on
political outcomes.

Another area for future research is to develop a coherent theoretical
explanation for how the nuclear balance of power affects different
stages of nuclear crises. I have demonstrated that [nuclear superiority
does not significantly reduce the risk of nuclear crisis
initiation]{.underline}. However, Kroenig (2013; 2018: 119) finds that
nuclear superiority contributes to favorable settlement of nuclear
crises, and that states possessing nuclear superiority have never been
targets of MCTs by nuclear inferior opponents, while several MCTs have
been issued against states having inferior nuclear capabilities. These
empirical patterns raise the need for further research on theoretical
mechanisms through which the nuclear balance influences state behavior
at different stages of nuclear crises. When and how does the nuclear
balance of power have an impact on states' decisions to initiate a
crisis, send escalatory threats, and make concessions against other
nuclear-armed opponents? Answers to these questions would advance the
literature on the merits of effective nuclear competition.

[Does the United States need to maintain nuclear supremacy]{.underline}
[over its nuclear rivals, including Russia and China]{.underline}? Since
1945, [US policymakers have continuously pursued meaningful military
nuclear advantages]{.underline} over nuclear-armed competitors.
Recently, [the Trump administration]{.underline} made several decisions
to pursue a more competitive nuclear policy. For instance, it announced
the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, in which it [strongly argued for
**modernizing** and adding **new forms** of delivery
systems]{.underline} [to the United States' already **massive nuclear
arsenals**]{.underline} to cope with the nuclear force modernization of
Russia and China (US Department of Defense, 2018). [It also declared a
withdrawal from the INF Treaty]{.underline}. The Biden administration
extended the New START Treaty for another five years, but at the time of
writing it is too early to know which nuclear modernization programs
from the Trump administration will be continued under Biden. From the
perspective of the nuclear competition school, [the Trump
administration's approach to nuclear issues reflects the continuous
emphasis on maintaining US nuclear primacy]{.underline} and
strengthening the deterrent power of US nuclear arsenal. Indeed, a
leading advocate of the school claims that ['the goal of US nuclear
strategy should be to reduce US vulnerability to nuclear
war]{.underline} to the greatest extent possible, [while simultaneously
maximizing adversary vulnerability']{.underline} (Kroenig, 2018: 199).

This article shows [**that empirical support** for this claim **is not**
as **strong** as argued by the nuclear competition school]{.underline}:
the history of nuclear crises demonstrates [that there is **no strong
evidence** indicating a link **between a favorable nuclear balance** of
power **and** the likelihood of **nuclear crisis**.]{.underline}
Accordingly[, **the U**nited **S**tates may **not** necessarily need to
devote valuable resources to a **nuclear arms race**]{.underline} [with
other nuclear-armed major powers]{.underline} in order to deter
potential challenges from them. Although the deterrent power of the
superior US nuclear forces is not as strong as it is often expected to
be, potential [adversaries would not be emboldened even if their nuclear
arsenals became superior to the US nuclear forces]{.underline} [--
putting aside the question of whether it is a realistic scenario that
potential nuclear-armed rivals would gain nuclear supremacy over the
United States]{.underline}. The nuclear balance of power between the
United States and a potential aggressor would not play a significant
role in determining whether [Washington would be able to dissuade the
aggressor from challenging its security interests]{.underline}. [Unless
a potential adversary can launch a successful nuclear disarming
strike**, which is almost impossible**]{.underline} in the foreseeable
future [given the survivability and sheer size of the US strategic
arsenal]{.underline}, [the United States can have strong confidence in
its ability to deter nuclear armed adversaries]{.underline} regardless
of the nuclear balance of power. [In the equation of

### 2AC -- Thucydides Trap

#### China is declining now -- [asymmetric alliances]{.underline} and [domestic crises]{.underline}.

Lawrence **Freedman 22**, emeritus professor of war studies at King\'s
College London, 1/12/2022, \"What the Thucydides Trap gets wrong about
China,\"
https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/geopolitics/2022/01/what-the-thucydides-trap-gets-wrong-about-china,
sg

The [alarming **possibility** of a **major conflict** between the US and
China has been framed as a likely consequence of]{.underline} a pattern
of [**great power behaviour** first identified by the]{.underline}
fifth-century BCE [historian **Thucydides**]{.underline}. In his study
of the Peloponnesian War, the Greek wrote: "It was the rise of Athens
and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable."
This argument is now most associated with the Harvard academic Graham
Allison, who claims to have identified 16 instances in which a dominant
power has sought to suppress an emerging rival before they became too
strong. He notes, disconcertingly, that 12 of these ended in war.

Allison first presented his thesis of the "Thucydides Trap" in the
Atlantic in 2015, and developed it in a book, Destined for War, in 2017.
Since then, Allison's argument that the relationship between the US and
China is growing increasingly volatile has gained even more credibility
with tensions over trade, the South China Sea and Taiwan.

[But Allison's notion]{.underline} of the Thucydides Trap -- [the
tendency towards war when **a rising power** threatens to displace an
existing one -- fails to address the risks involved in
conflict]{.underline} and the reasons why wars occur. The story told by
Thucydides is much more complicated than the "Trap" suggests. The
[notion of **inevitable conflict** between **Athens** and **Sparta**
elides the fact that the Athenian leader Pericles made poor **strategic
calls.**]{.underline} Different decisions would have avoided war.

These choices were largely about the cohesion of the respective Athenian
and Spartan alliances, and the possibility of a smaller state defecting
because it did not feel protected. [A major difference now is that there
are **asymmetrical alliances:** China is far more isolated
**geopolitically** than the US.]{.underline}

If lessons are to be drawn from past power struggles the most relevant
among them is the Cold War. The avoidance of armed conflict between the
US and the Soviet Union was to a great extent owing to the presence of
nuclear weapons. This is a threat that both Beijing and Washington must
consider and in that respect, the Cold War is a better comparison than
the rivalries between Portugal and Spain in the 15th century or those
between England and the Dutch Republic in the 17th.

[China is also involved in a complex set of **power relationships**.
Russia was once China's senior partner; now it is **China** that is the
stronger]{.underline}. Fifty years ago they almost came to blows; now
they enjoy an uneasy cordiality. Meanwhile, [there has been **tension**
on China's border with India]{.underline} (another rising power?), while
in 2014, the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe noted disturbing
similarities between Europe in 1914 and his country's dispute with China
over the Senkaku Islands (claimed by China as the Diaoyu Islands).
[China must consider **possible conflicts** with all the **major
players** in the region, and not just the US]{.underline}. To Beijing's
consternation new security pacts have emerged, such as the Quad,
consisting of the US, Australia, Japan and India, and the Aukus
agreement between Australia, the UK and the US.

As China has become more powerful it has grown more assertive, which is
why its neighbours have become anxious about its intentions. But
[contrary to the logic of the **Thucydides Trap**, in the past China
went to war --with **Korea in 1950,** **India in 1962**, and **Vietnam
in 1979** -- when it was in a position of weakness, not strength. Its
**military** and **economic** power is]{.underline} now
[second]{.underline} only [to the US]{.underline}, but that also means
[China has much more to lose in any kind of protracted, **multi-front
conflict**.]{.underline}

[The "Trap" argument is also undermined when you consider]{.underline}
the view held by many experts [that China's power]{.underline} may have
**[already peaked]{.underline}**. [The nation is facing]{.underline} a
series of system problems that may halt its rise, including [an
**unbalanced economy**, an **ageing population**, **environmental
degradation** and **political dysfunction**]{.underline} resulting from
President Xi Jinping's authoritarian turn. Indeed, recent war scares
start from the assumption that the leadership in Beijing might want to
invade Taiwan before China's power wanes.

This is not a book about China. It is about the impact of a rising China
on the U.S. and the global order. [For seven decades since the Second
World War, a [rules-based framework led by Washington]{.mark} has
[defined world order]{.mark}, producing an **[era without war]{.mark}**
among great powers. Most people now think of this as normal. Historians
call it a rare "[Long Peace]{.mark}."]{.underline} Today, an
increasingly powerful China is unraveling this order, throwing into
question the peace generations have taken for granted.

In 2015, the Atlantic published ["The [Thucydides Trap]{.mark}: Are the
U.S. and China headed for War?" In that essay I argued that this
[historical metaphor]{.mark} provides the best lens available for
illuminating relations between China and the U.S. today. Since then, the
concept has ignited considerable debate. Rather than face the evidence
and reflect on the uncomfortable but necessary adjustments both sides
might make, [policy wonks]{.mark} and presidents alike have [constructed
a **straw man around**]{.mark} **Thucydides's claim about
"[inevitability]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

They have then put a torch to it --- arguing that war between Washington
and Beijing is not predetermined. At their 2015 summit, Presidents
Barack Obama and Xi Jinping discussed the Trap at length. Obama
emphasized that despite the structural stress created by China's rise,
"the two countries are capable of managing their disagreements." At the
same time, they acknowledged that, in Xi's words, "should major
countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation,
they might create such traps for themselves."

[I concur: **[war between]{.mark} the [U.S. and China is not
inevitable]{.mark}**. Indeed, Thucydides would agree that neither was
war between Athens and Sparta. Read in context, it is **clear that [he
meant]{.mark}** [his claim about **inevitability as hyperbole**]{.mark}:
exaggeration for the purpose of emphasis. The point of Thucydides's Trap
is **neither fatalism nor pessimism**. Instead, it points us beyond the
headlines and regime rhetoric to recognize the tectonic structural
stress that Beijing and Washington must master to construct a peaceful
relationship.]{.underline}

## War Inevitable

### 1NC -- War Inevitable 

#### China war is inevitable -- it's only a question of when

Brandon **Yoder 19;** Ph.D., Department of Politics, University of
Virginia, Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore Lee
Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Centre on Asia and Globalisation,
January 28^th^, 2019, "Uncertainty, Shifting Power and Credible Signals
in US-China Relations: Why the "Thucydides Trap" Is Real, but Limited",
Journal of Chinese Political Science, Volume 24, Issue 1,
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-019-09606-1>

This logic has not been well-recognized by either US foreign
policymakers or scholars of US-China relations, however. On economic
issues, the US adopted a strategy of unconditional cooperation for the
first two decades of China's rise. This strategy was not necessarily
misguided. However, absent any degree of hedging by the US, China's
cooperation with the US-led economic order should have been seen as
largely non-credible[. A rising China had strong incentives to
misrepresent any hypothetically-revisionist intentions it might have
held]{.underline}, as long [as doing so would elicit continued US
accommodation that facilitated China's rapid power gains]{.underline}.
Yet [many China experts took China's cooperative behavior]{.underline}
during this period [at face value, ignoring its incentives to
misrepresent and drawing overly optimistic conclusions that China truly
shared American preferences for the international order]{.underline}
\[29, 32, 56, 61\]. Even more troublingly[, the Trump administration has
recently expressed confident beliefs that China's intentions are
hostile, and consequently begun to implement policies of
escalating]{.underline} economic [containment toward China]{.underline}.
Yet this conclusion is also unwarranted: China's revisionist behavior
has been generally limited to its territorial disputes in the South
China Sea, whereas its economic and institutional actions are either
ambiguous or supportive of the US-led liberal order \[31\]. Ironically,
the Trump administration's emerging strategy of economic containment,
which has been adopted due to ill-formed pessimistic beliefs about
China's intentions, lends considerable (though incomplete) credibility
to China's cooperative signals on economic and institutional dimensions.
To the extent that China continues to defend and advocate a rules-based
liberal economic order in the face of Trump's economic containment, this
is a much more credible signal of China's benign intentions than its
previous cooperation under unconditional US accommodation. Thus, current
US foreign policy turns the logic of hedging on its head: rather than
hedging due to uncertainty and updating their beliefs in response to
China's subsequent behavior, policymakers have assumed China's hostility
and are initiating what appears to be a strategy of unconditional
containment. Power Shifts, Uncertainty, and US-China Relations The
Thucydides trap is not a new concept -- it is fundamentally equivalent
to what Jack Levy referred to more than three decades ago as the
preventive motivation for war \[9, 42\]. When a declining state knows
that its preferences conflict with those of a rising state, war can
occur due to the well-known "commitment problem," which refers to a
rising state's inability to commit to not use its future power gains to
exploit the declining state \[13, 54\]. Under complete information,
there is always a range of peaceful bargains that both the riser and
decliner would prefer to war, if the bargain could be guaranteed to
endure into the future. However, as the rising state gains power its
bargaining leverage would increase, giving it an ex post incentive to
revise the settlement in its own favor at the decliner's expense. Thus,
when the power shift is sufficiently large, the declining state prefers
a winner-take-all war in the present to the eventual settlement the
riser will impose in the future if the decliner were to acquiesce to the
power shift. Note, however, that the commitment problem obtains only
when the rising and declining states have sufficiently divergent
preferences over the shape of the international order. If the rising and
declining states have highly compatible preferences, the decliner
sacrifices little by allowing the riser to gain power. This "benign"
riser (from the decliner's perspective) would simply use its power to
maintain the same order that the decliner prefers. Conversely, however,
[if the riser's preferences are]{.underline} highly [incompatible with
the decliner's, then it will use its power gains to radically revise the
international order in ways that are at odds with the decliner's
preferences]{.underline}. It is with this sort of "hostile" rising state
that commitment problems obtain under complete information, [yielding
strong incentives for the decliner to initiate]{.underline} preventive
[war]{.underline}. Commitment problems do not obtain when the rising
state is known to be benign (\[36\]:119; \[67\]). This [raises the
question of what the decliner should do when it is uncertain about the
compatibility of the rising state's preferences with its
own]{.underline}. As discussed below, [this is the situation that
characterizes contemporary US-China relations. It is this sort of
uncertainty that lies at the heart of the security dilemma]{.underline},
the phenomenon [by which conflict can occur even between states with
mutually-compatible preferences due to]{.underline} misplaced (but
rational) [distrust of the other's intentions]{.underline}. Under the
combination of shifting power and uncertainty, commitment problems
potentially obtain if the rising state turns out to be hostile. In this
case, [the decliner]{.underline} may [not be willing to risk
accommodating the rising state]{.underline} if the consequences of
exploitation by a hostile riser outweigh the benefits of cooperation
with a benign one. [Instead, the decliner would initiate]{.underline}
preventive [conflict]{.underline}. Yet because there is some probability
that the rising state is actually benign, this opens up the possibility
of "tragic" conflict between truly compatible states. If uncertainty
about the riser's intentions cannot be overcome, or at least mitigated,
[a sufficiently large power shift would produce war even between
rational states whose interests do not conflict at all]{.underline}. A
prominent subset of realist scholars has compellingly argued that this
is often the case: [large power shifts engender formidable barriers to
the credibility of rising states' cooperative signals]{.underline}, such
that uncertainty about others' intentions is intractable [and
**declining states must make worst-case assumptions about rising states'
intentions**]{.underline} \[9, 12, 45, 53\]. This is [**because hostile
rising states have strong incentives to misrepresent their intentions**
while relatively weak, by mimicking the cooperative behaviors of benign
risers and refraining from attempting to revise the international
order]{.underline}. These realists argue that for hostile risers the
costs of foregoing immediate revision are outweighed by the prospects of
[avoiding opposition from the decliner and attempting revision under a
more favorable distribution of power in the future]{.underline}. As
such, **[if cooperative signals are likely to be sent by both benign and
hostile risers]{.underline}** alike, **[such signals are non-credible,
and declining states]{.underline}** should [**remain highly uncertain**
about any rising state's]{.underline} future [intentions. This
exacerbates the security dilemma, and gives declining states strong
incentives to take]{.underline} preventive [action even against risers
that have exhibited cooperative behavior]{.underline}. [This barrier to
credible signaling during power shifts has]{.underline} also [been
applied to contemporary US-China relations]{.underline}. For many
realists, [it is entirely possible that]{.underline} "[China is just
practicing common sense and behaving itself until it is a more powerful
and consolidated entity]{.underline}" (\[33\]:203), [and]{.underline}
"[pursuing a peaceful policy today in order to strengthen itself to
confront the United States tomorrow]{.underline}" (\[40\]:14). As such,
a common conclusion has been that "we cannot tell much about China's
future behavior, because it \[currently\] has such limited capacity to
act aggressively" (\[46\]:385).

[This is the real trap the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should worry about]{.mark} regarding
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} today---[[the trap in which a]{.mark}n
**aspiring [superpower]{.mark}** [peaks and then refuses to
bear]{.mark}]{.underline} the painful consequences of
**[descent]{.underline}**.

China's rise is no mirage: Decades of growth have given Beijing the
economic sinews of global power. Major investments in key technologies
and communications infrastructure have yielded a strong position in the
struggle for geoeconomic influence; China is using a multi-continent
Belt and Road Initiative to bring other states into its orbit. Most
alarming, think tank assessments and U.S. Defense Department reports
show China's increasingly formidable military now stands a real chance
of winning a war against the United States in the Western Pacific.

It is unsurprising, therefore, that China has also developed the
ambitions of a superpower: Xi has more or less announced that Beijing
desires to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and
other disputed areas, becoming Asia's preeminent power and challenging
the United States for global leadership. Yet if China's geopolitical
window of opportunity is real, its future is already starting to look
quite grim because it is quickly losing the advantages that propelled
its rapid growth.

[From the 1970s]{.underline} to the 2000s, [China was nearly
**self-sufficient** in **food**, **water**, and **energy
resources**]{.underline}. It enjoyed the [**greatest demographic
dividend** in history]{.underline}, with 10 working-age adults for every
senior citizen aged 65 or older. (For most major economies, the average
is closer to 5 working-age adults for every senior citizen.) [China had
a secure geopolitical **environment** and **easy access**
to]{.underline} foreign [**markets** and **tech**]{.underline}nology,
all underpinned by friendly relations with the United States. And
China's government skillfully harnessed these advantages by carrying out
a process of economic reform and opening while also moving the regime
from stifling totalitarianism under former Chinese leader Mao Zedong to
a smarter---if still deeply repressive---form of authoritarianism under
his successors. [China had]{.underline} it all from the 1970s to the
early 2010s---[just the mix of **endowments**, **environment**,
**people**, and **policies** needed to thrive.]{.underline}

Since the late 2000s, however, the [[drivers of China]{.mark}'s rise
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} either [[stalled]{.underline}]{.mark} or
turned around entirely. For example, [China is running out of resources:
[**Water** has become **scarce**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and
[[the country is importing more **energy** and **food** than
any]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[nation]{.underline}]{.mark}, having
ravaged its own natural resources. Economic growth is therefore becoming
costlier: According to data from DBS Bank, it takes three times as many
inputs to produce a unit of growth today as it did in the early 2000s.

[China is]{.underline} also [approaching a **[demographic
precipice]{.mark}**: From **2020** to **2050**, [it will
lose]{.mark}]{.underline} an astounding [[200 million]{.mark}
working-age [adults]{.mark}]{.underline}---a population the size of
Nigeria---and gain 200 million senior citizens. The [**fiscal** and
**[economic]{.mark} [consequences]{.mark}** [will be
**devastating**]{.mark}]{.underline}: Current projections suggest
China's medical and social security [spending will have to triple as a
share of GDP]{.underline}, from 10 percent to 30 percent, by 2050 [just
to prevent millions of seniors from dying]{.underline} of impoverishment
and neglect.

To make matters worse, [[China]{.mark} is turning away from]{.underline}
the package of policies that promoted [**rapid growth**. Under Xi,
Beijing has slid]{.underline} back [toward
**totalitarianism**]{.underline}. [Xi]{.underline} has appointed himself
"chairman of everything," [destroyed]{.underline} any semblance of
**[collective rule]{.underline}**, and made adherence to "Xi Jinping
thought" the ideological core of an increasingly rigid regime. And [he
has]{.underline} relentlessly [[pursued]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[centralization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of power [[at the expense of
**economic prosperity**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**State zombie firms** are]{.underline} being [propped up while
[**private firms** are starved of **capital**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Objective economic analysis is being replaced by government propaganda.
[[Innovation is becoming]{.mark} more [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline} in
a climate of stultifying ideological conformity. Meanwhile[, Xi's brutal
**anti-corruption campaign** has deterred
**entrepreneurship**,]{.underline} and a wave of politically driven
**[[reg]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulation**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[[erased]{.mark} more than **[\$1 trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
the market capitalization of China's leading tech firms. Xi hasn't
simply stopped the process of economic liberalization that powered
China's development: He has thrown it hard into reverse.

The economic damage these [trends are]{.underline} causing is [starting
to accumulate]{.underline}---and it is compounding the slowdown that
would have occurred anyway as a fast-growing economy matures. The
[**Chinese economy** has been losing steam]{.underline} for more than a
decade: The country's [official [**growth rate**
declined]{.mark}]{.underline} from 14 percent in 2007 to 6 percent in
2019, and rigorous studies suggest the true growth rate is now closer to
2 percent. Worse, most of that [growth stems from government **[stimulus
spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to data from the Conference
Board, total factor productivity declined 1.3 percent every year on
average between 2008 and 2019, meaning China is spending more to produce
less each year. [This has [led]{.mark}]{.underline}, in turn,
[[to]{.mark} **massive [debt]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [China's total debt
[surged **eight-fold**]{.mark}]{.underline} between 2008 and 2019 and
exceeded 300 percent of GDP prior to COVID-19. Any country that has
accumulated debt or lost productivity at anything close to China's
current pace has subsequently suffered at least one "lost decade" of
near-zero economic growth.

All of this is happening, moreover, as [China confronts an increasingly
**hostile**]{.underline} external [environment]{.underline}. The
[combination of COVID]{.underline}-19, persistent
**[h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights
**[abuses]{.underline}**, and **[aggressive policies]{.underline}** have
[caused negative views of China]{.underline} to reach levels not seen
since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. [[Countries]{.mark} worried
about **Chinese competition** have [slapped]{.mark} thousands of **new
[trade barriers]{.mark}**]{.underline} on its goods since 2008. More
than a dozen countries have dropped out of Xi's Belt and Road Initiative
while the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [wages a
**global campaign** against key Chinese **tech
companies**]{.underline}---notably, **[Huawei]{.underline}**---and rich
democracies across multiple continents throw up barriers to Beijing's
digital influence. The [world is becoming **less conducive** to easy
**Chinese growth**]{.underline}, and [[Xi]{.mark}'s regime]{.underline}
increasingly [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark} the sort of **[strategic
[encirclement]{.mark}]{.underline}** that once drove German and Japanese
leaders to desperation.

Case in point is U.S. policy. Over the past five years, two U.S.
presidential administrations have committed the United States to a
policy of "competition"---really, neo-containment---vis-à-vis China.
U.S. defense strategy is now focused squarely on defeating Chinese
aggression in the Western Pacific; [Washington is using]{.underline} an
array of [**trade** and **tech**]{.underline}nological [sanctions to
check Beijing's influence]{.underline} and limit its prospects for
economic primacy. "Once imperial America considers you as their 'enemy,'
you're in big trouble," one senior People's Liberation Army officer
warned. Indeed, the United States has also committed to orchestrating
greater global resistance to Chinese power, a campaign that is starting
to show results as more and more countries respond to the threat from
Beijing.

[In]{.underline} maritime [Asia]{.underline}, [**resistance** to
**Chinese power** is stiffening]{.underline}. [Taiwan is boosting
**military spending**]{.underline} and laying plans to turn itself into
a strategic porcupine in the Western Pacific. [Japan is carrying out its
biggest **military buildup**]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War
and has agreed to back the United States if China attacks Taiwan. The
countries around the South China Sea, particularly [Vietnam and
Indonesia, are beefing up their **air**, **naval**, and **coast guard**
forces]{.underline} to contest China's expansive claims.

Other countries are pushing back against Beijing's assertiveness as
well. [Australia is expanding]{.underline} northern [bases to
accommodate U.S. ships]{.underline} and aircraft and building long-range
conventional missiles and nuclear-powered attack submarines. [India is
massing forces on its border with China while sending **warships**
through the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea. The **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion has [labeled Beijing a "**systemic
rival**]{.underline}," and Europe's three greatest powers---France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom---have dispatched naval task forces to
the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. A variety of multilateral
anti-China initiatives---the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; supply
chain alliances; the new so-called AUKUS alliance with Washington,
London, and Canberra; and others---are in the works. The United States'
"multilateral club strategy," hawkish and well-connected scholar Yan
Xuetong acknowledged in July, is "isolating China" and hurting its
development.

No doubt, counter-China cooperation has remained imperfect. But the
overall trend is clear: [An [array of actors is]{.mark}]{.underline}
gradually [[joining]{.underline}]{.mark} forces [[to check]{.mark}
**Beijing's [power]{.mark}**]{.underline} and put it in a strategic box.
China, in other words, is not a forever-ascendant country. It is an
already-strong, enormously ambitious, and deeply troubled power whose
window of opportunity won't stay open for long.

In some ways, all of this is welcome news for Washington: A
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is **slowing economically**]{.mark}
and facing]{.underline} growing **[global resistance]{.underline}**
[will find it]{.underline} exceedingly [difficult to displace the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates as the world's leading
power---so long as the United States doesn't tear itself apart or
otherwise give the game away. In other ways, however, the news is more
troubling. [History warns the world should expect a **[peaking
China]{.mark}**]{.underline} to act more boldly, even
**[erratically]{.underline}**, over the coming decade---to
[**[lunge]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} long-sought **strategic
[prizes]{.mark}**]{.underline} before its fortunes fade.

What might this look like? We can make educated guesses based on what
China is presently doing.

[Beijing is]{.underline} already **[redoubling]{.underline}** its
[efforts to establish a 21st century **sphere** of **economic
influence**]{.underline} by dominating critical technologies---[such as
**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, [**quantum
computing**, and **5G**]{.underline} telecommunications---and using the
resulting leverage to bend states to its will. It will also race to
perfect a "digital authoritarianism" that can protect an insecure
Chinese Communist Party's rule at home while bolstering Beijing's
diplomatic position by exporting that model to autocratic allies around
the world.

Most troubling of all, [[China will]{.mark} be]{.underline} sorely
[tempted to [use force to resolve]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** question on its terms in the next
decade.

In military terms, the **[C]{.underline}**hinese
**[C]{.underline}**ommunist **[P]{.underline}**arty [may well
become]{.underline} increasingly [**heavy-handed** in
securing]{.underline} long, vulnerable **[supply lines]{.underline}**
and protecting infrastructure projects in Central and Southwest Asia,
Africa, and other regions, a role some hawks in the People's Liberation
Army are already eager to assume. [[Beijing could]{.mark} also [become
more **assertive** vis-à-vis Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
Philippines, and other countries that stand in the way of its claims to
the South and East China Seas.

Most troubling of all, [[China will]{.mark}]{.underline} be sorely
tempted to [[use force to resolve]{.underline}]{.mark} the Taiwan
[[question]{.underline}]{.mark} on its terms in the next decade [before
Washington and Taipei can finish **retooling** their
**militaries**]{.underline} to offer a stronger defense. [The
**[P]{.mark}**]{.underline}eople's **[[L]{.underline}]{.mark}**iberation
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[stepping up]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[military [exercises']{.mark}
intensity]{.underline}** in the Taiwan Strait. [Xi has]{.underline}
repeatedly [declared Beijing cannot wait forever]{.underline} for its
"renegade province" to return to the fold. When the military balance
temporarily shifts further toward China's favor in the late 2020s and as
the Pentagon is forced to retire aging ships and aircraft, China may
never have a better chance of seizing Taiwan and dealing Washington a
humiliating defeat.

To be clear, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} probably won't undertake an
all-out military rampage across Asia, as Japan did in the 1930s and
early 1940s. But it [[will run]{.mark} **[greater]{.mark} risks**
and]{.underline} accept greater [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} [as it
tries to lock [in]{.mark} **key [gains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Welcome
to geopolitics [in the age of a peaking [China]{.mark}]{.underline}: a
country that already has the ability to violently challenge the existing
order and one that [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably run faster and
[[push harder]{.mark} as it loses **confidence**]{.underline} that time
is on its side.

### 2NC -- General

#### War's [inevitable]{.underline} -- excessive [DoD expenditure]{.underline}, [Taiwanese commitments]{.underline}, anti-[Chinese sentiment]{.underline}.

[It's the **[summer of 2026]{.mark}**, five years after the
[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} administration [[identified]{.mark} the
**[P]{.mark}**eople's **[R]{.mark}**epublic of **[C]{.mark}**hina [as
the]{.mark} **principal [threat]{.mark}** to US security]{.underline}
and Congress passed a raft of laws mandating a society-wide mobilization
to ensure permanent US domination of the Asia-Pacific region. Although
major armed conflict between the United States and China has not yet
broken out, [**numerous crises** have erupted in the **western Pacific**
and the **two countries** are constantly poised for war.]{.underline}
International [[diplomacy has]{.mark} largely [broken
down]{.mark}]{.underline}, with talks over climate change, pandemic
relief, and nuclear nonproliferation at a standstill. For most security
analysts, [[it's not a matter of if]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[US-China
war]{.underline}** will erupt, [but when.]{.underline}

[Does this sound fanciful? Not if you read]{.underline} the statements
coming out of [the **D**]{.underline}epartment [**o**f]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**efense (DoD) and the upper ranks of Congress these
days.

"[[China poses]{.mark} the greatest **long-term [challenge]{.mark}** [to
the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
and strengthening deterrence against China will require DoD to work in
concert with other instruments of national power," the
[Pentagon's]{.underline} 2022 [Defense Budget Overview
asserts.]{.underline} "A [**[combat]{.mark}-credible** Joint Force [will
underpin]{.mark} a **whole-of-nation approach** to
**[competition]{.mark}** and]{.underline} ensure the Nation leads from a
position of **[strength]{.underline}**."

On this basis, the [[Pentagon]{.mark} requested **\$715
billion**]{.underline} in military expenditures for 2022, with a
significant chunk of those funds to be spent on the procurement of
advanced ships, planes, and missiles [[intended for]{.mark}
a]{.underline} potential all-out, "[[**high-intensity**" war with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. An [extra]{.underline} \$38 billion [was
sought for the design]{.underline} and production [of
**nucl**]{.underline}ear weapon**[s]{.underline}**, another [**key
aspect** of the drive to overpower China.]{.underline}

[Democrats and Republicans]{.underline} in Congress,
[contend]{.underline}ing that even such [sums were **insufficient** to
ensure]{.underline} continued US superiority vis-à-vis that country, are
pressing for further increases in the 2022 Pentagon budget. Many have
also endorsed the EAGLE Act, short for Ensuring American Global
Leadership and Engagement---a measure intended to provide hundreds of
billions of dollars for increased military aid to America's Asian allies
and for research on advanced technologies deemed essential for any
future [[**high-tech arms race** with China]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Imagine, then, that such trends only gain momentum over the next five
years. What will this country be like in 2026? What can we expect from
an [[intensifying new **Cold War**]{.mark} with China
[that]{.mark},]{.underline} by then, [[could be]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the verge of **[turning [hot]{.mark}]{.underline}**?

TAIWAN 2026: PERPETUALLY ON THE BRINK

[Crises]{.underline} over Taiwan have erupted on a periodic basis since
the start of the decade, but now, in 2026, they [seem to be occurring
every]{.underline} other [week]{.underline}. With **[Chinese
[bombers]{.mark}]{.underline}** and warships [constantly
[probing]{.mark}]{.underline} Taiwan's outer
[[defenses]{.underline}]{.mark} and US naval vessels regularly
maneuvering close to their Chinese counterparts in waters near the
island, the [two sides [never]{.mark} seem [far from]{.mark} a
**shooting incident** that would have [instantaneous **escalatory
implications**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So far, no lives have been lost,
but planes and ships from both sides have narrowly missed colliding
again and again. On each occasion, forces on both sides have been placed
on high alert, causing jitters around the world.

The tensions over that island have largely stemmed from incremental
efforts by Taiwanese leaders, mostly officials of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), to move their country from autonomous status as
part of China to full independence. Such a move is bound to provoke a
harsh, possibly military response from Beijing, which considers the
island a renegade province.

The island's status has plagued US-China relations for decades. When, on
January 1, 1979, Washington first recognized the People's Republic of
China, it agreed to withdraw diplomatic recognition from the Taiwanese
government and cease formal relations with its officials. Under the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, however, US officials were obligated to
conduct informal relations with Taipei. The act stipulated as well that
any move by Beijing to alter Taiwan's status by force would be
considered "a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
area and of grave concern to the United States"---a stance known as
"strategic ambiguity," as it neither guaranteed American intervention,
nor ruled it out.

In the ensuing decades, the United States sought to avoid conflict in
the region by persuading Taipei not to make any overt moves toward
independence and by minimizing its ties to the island, thereby
discouraging aggressive moves by China. By 2021, however, the situation
had been remarkably transformed. Once under the exclusive control of the
Nationalist Party that had been defeated by communist forces on the
Chinese mainland in 1949, [Taiwan became a **multiparty
democracy**]{.underline} in 1987. It has since witnessed the steady rise
of pro-independence forces, led by the DPP. At first, the mainland
regime sought to woo the Taiwanese with abundant trade and tourism
opportunities, but the [**excessive [authoritarianism]{.mark}** of its
**Communist Party** [alienated]{.mark} many island
[residents]{.mark}]{.underline}--- especially younger ones ---only
[adding]{.underline} momentum to the [drive for
**independence**]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn,
[has [prompted Beijing to]{.mark}]{.underline} switch tactics from
courtship to coercion by constantly [[send]{.underline}ing]{.mark} its
[[combat]{.underline}]{.mark} planes and [[ships into
**Taiwan**]{.mark}**ese**]{.underline} air and sea space.

Trump administration officials, less concerned about alienating Beijing
than their predecessors, sought to bolster ties with the Taiwanese
government in a series of gestures that Beijing found threatening and
that were only expanded in the early months of the Biden administration.
At that time, growing hostility to China led many in Washington to call
for an end to "strategic ambiguity" and the adoption of an unequivocal
pledge to defend Taiwan if it were to come under attack from the
mainland.

"I think the time has come to be clear," Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas
declared in February 2021. "Replace strategic ambiguity with strategic
clarity that the United States will come to the aid of Taiwan if China
was to forcefully invade Taiwan."

The Biden administration was initially reluctant to adopt such an
inflammatory stance, since it meant that any conflict between China and
Taiwan would automatically become a US-China war with nuclear
ramifications. In April 2022, however, under intense congressional
pressure, the Biden administration formally abandoned "strategic
ambiguity" and vowed that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would prompt an
[immediate American]{.underline} military [response. "We will **never
allow Taiwan to be subjugated**]{.underline} by military force,"
President Biden declared at that time, a striking change in a
long-standing American strategic position.

The DoD would soon announce the deployment of a permanent naval squadron
to the waters surrounding Taiwan, including an aircraft carrier and a
supporting flotilla of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Ely Ratner,
President Biden's top envoy for the Asia-Pacific region, first outlined
plans for such a force in June 2021 during testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee. A permanent US presence, he suggested, would
serve to "deter, and, if necessary, deny a fait accompli scenario" in
which Chinese forces quickly attempted to overwhelm Taiwan. Although
described as tentative then, it would, in fact, become formal policy
following President Biden's April 2022 declaration on Taiwan and a brief
exchange of warning shots between a Chinese destroyer and a US cruiser
just south of the Taiwan Strait.

Today, [in 2026]{.underline}, with a [**US naval** [squadron]{.mark}
constantly [sailing]{.mark} in waters [near Taiwan]{.mark} and Chinese
ships and planes]{.underline} constantly [[menacing]{.mark}
the]{.underline} island's outer [[defenses]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
[[potential]{.mark} **Sino-American military [clash]{.mark}** [never
seems far off]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should that occur, what would happen
is impossible to predict, but most analysts now assume that both sides
would immediately fire their advanced missiles---many of them hypersonic
(that is, exceeding five times the speed of sound)---at their opponent's
key bases and facilities. This, in turn, would provoke further rounds of
air and missile strikes, probably involving attacks on Chinese and
Taiwanese cities as well as US bases in Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and
Guam. Whether such a conflict could be contained at the non-nuclear
level remains anyone's guess.

THE INCREMENTAL DRAFT

In the meantime, planning for a US-China war-to-come has dramatically
reshaped American society and institutions. The "Forever Wars" of the
first two decades of the 21st century had been fought entirely by an
All-Volunteer Force (AVF) that typically endured multiple tours of duty,
in particular in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States was able to
sustain such combat operations (while continuing to maintain a
substantial troop presence in Europe, Japan, and South Korea) with 1.4
million service members because American forces enjoyed uncontested
control of the airspace over its war zones, while China and Russia
remained wary of engaging US forces in their own neighborhoods.

Today, in 2026, however, the picture looks radically different: China,
with an active combat force of 2 million soldiers, and Russia, with
another million---both militaries equipped with advanced weaponry not
widely available to them in the early years of the century---pose a far
more formidable threat to US forces. An AVF no longer looks particularly
viable, so plans for its replacement with various forms of conscription
are already being put into place.

Bear in mind, however, that in a future war with China and/or Russia,
the Pentagon doesn't envision large-scale ground battles reminiscent of
World War II or the Iraq invasion of 2003. Instead, it expects a series
of high-tech battles involving large numbers of ships, planes, and
missiles. This, in turn, limits the need for vast conglomerations of
ground troops, or "grunts," as they were once labeled, but increases the
need for sailors, pilots, missile launchers, and the kinds of
technicians who can keep so many high-tech systems at top operational
capacity.

As early as October 2020, during the final months of the Trump
administration, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was already calling for
a doubling of the size of the US naval fleet, from approximately 250 to
500 combat vessels, to meet the rising threat from China. Clearly,
however, there would be no way for a force geared to a 250-ship navy to
sustain one double that size. Even if some of the additional ships were
"uncrewed," or robotic, the Navy would still have to recruit several
hundred thousand more sailors and technicians to supplement the 330,000
then in the force. Much the same could be said of the US Air Force.

No surprise, then, that an incremental restoration of the draft,
abandoned in 1973 as the Vietnam War was drawing to a close, has taken
place in these years. In 2022, Congress passed the National Service
Reconstitution Act (NSRA), which requires all men and women aged 18 to
25 to register with newly reconstituted National Service Centers and to
provide them with information on their residence, employment status, and
educational background---information they are required to update on an
annual basis. In 2023, the NSRA was amended to require registrants to
complete an additional questionnaire on their technical, computer, and
language skills. Since 2024, all men and women enrolled in computer
science and related programs at federally aided colleges and
universities have been required to enroll in the National Digital
Reserve Corps (NDRC) and spend their summers working on defense-related
programs at selected military installations and headquarters. Members of
that Digital Corps must also be available on short notice for deployment
to such facilities, should a conflict of any sort threaten to break out.

The establishment of just such a corps, it should be noted, had been a
recommendation of the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence, a federal agency established in 2019 to advise Congress
and the White House on how to prepare the nation for a high-tech arms
race with China. "We must win the AI competition that is intensifying
strategic competition with China," the commission avowed in March 2021,
given that "the human talent deficit is the government's most
conspicuous AI deficit." To overcome it, the commission suggested then,
"We should establish a...civilian National Reserve to grow tech talent
with the same seriousness of purpose that we grow military officers. The
digital age demands a digital corps."

Indeed, only five years later, with the prospect of a US-China conflict
so obviously on the agenda, Congress is considering a host of bills
aimed at supplementing the Digital Corps with other mandatory service
requirements for men and women with technical skills, or simply for the
reinstatement of conscription altogether and the full-scale mobilization
of the nation. Needless to say, protests against such measures have been
erupting at many colleges and universities, but with the mood of the
country becoming increasingly bellicose, there has been little support
for them among the general public. Clearly, the "volunteer" military is
about to become an artifact of a previous epoch.

A NEW COLD WAR CULTURE OF REPRESSION

With the White House, Congress, and [the **Pentagon** obsessively
focused on preparations for]{.underline} what's increasingly seen as [an
inevitable war with China]{.underline}, it's hardly surprising that
[**[civil society]{.mark}** in 2026 has similarly been
[swept]{.mark}]{.underline} up [[in]{.mark} an increasingly
**militaristic [anti-China spirit]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Popular
culture is now saturated with nationalistic and jingoistic memes,
regularly portraying China and the Chinese leadership in derogatory,
often racist terms. Domestic [manufacturers hype "[**Made in America**"
labels]{.mark}]{.underline} (even if they're often inaccurate) and firms
that once traded extensively with China loudly proclaim their withdrawal
from that market, while the streaming superhero movie of the moment, The
Beijing Conspiracy, on a foiled Chinese plot to disable the entire US
electrical grid, is the leading candidate for the best film Oscar.

Domestically, by far the most conspicuous and pernicious result of all
this has been a [sharp [rise in **hate crimes**]{.mark} against Asian
Americans]{.underline}, [especially those assumed to be
Chinese]{.underline}, whatever their origin. This disturbing phenomenon,
which began at the outset of the Covid crisis, when President Trump, in
a transparent effort to deflect blame for his mishandling of the
pandemic, started using terms like "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu" to
describe the disease. Attacks on Asian Americans rose precipitously then
and continued to climb after Joe Biden took office and began vilifying
Beijing for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. According
to the watchdog group Stop AAPI Hate, some 6,600 anti-Asian incidents
were reported in the United States between March 2020 and March 2021,
with almost 40 percent of those events occurring in February and March
2021.

For observers of such incidents back then, [the connection between
**anti-China policy-making** at the national level and **anti-Asian
violence** at the **neighborhood level** was
**incontrovertible**.]{.underline} "[When **America
China-bashes**]{.underline}, then Chinese get bashed, and [so do those
who 'look Chinese]{.underline},'" said Russell Jeung, a professor of
Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University at that time.
"American foreign policy in Asia is American [domestic policy for
Asians."]{.underline}

By 2026, most Chinatowns in America have been boarded up and those that
remain open are heavily guarded by armed police. Most stores owned by
Asian Americans (of whatever background) were long ago closed due to
boycotts and vandalism, and Asian Americans think twice before leaving
their homes.

The hostility and distrust exhibited toward Asian Americans at the
neighborhood level has been replicated at the workplace and on
university campuses, where Chinese Americans and Chinese-born citizens
are now prohibited from working at laboratories in any technical field
with military applications. Meanwhile, scholars of any background
working on China-related topics are subject to close scrutiny by their
employers and government officials. Anyone expressing positive comments
about China or its government is routinely subjected to harassment, at
best, or at worst, dismissal and FBI investigation.

As with the incremental draft, such increasingly restrictive measures
were first adopted in a series of laws in 2022. But the foundation for
much of this was the United States Innovation and Competition Act of
2021, passed by the Senate in June of that year. Among other provisions,
it barred federal funding to any college or university that hosted a
Confucius Institute, a Chinese government program to promote that
country's language and culture in foreign countries. It also empowered
federal agencies to coordinate with university officials to "promote
protection of controlled information as appropriate and strengthen
defense against foreign intelligence services," especially Chinese ones.

DIVERGING FROM THE PATH OF WAR

Yes, in reality, we're still in 2021, [even if the **Biden
administration** regularly cites China as our greatest
threat]{.underline}. **[[Naval incidents]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
that country's vessels in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[on the rise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[as are **anti--Asian American sentiments** domestically]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, as the planet's two greatest greenhouse-gas emitters
squabble, our world is growing hotter by the year.

Without question, something like the **[developments]{.underline}**
described above (and possibly far worse) [will lie in our future unless
action is taken]{.underline} to alter the path we're now on. All of
those "**[2026" developments]{.underline}**, after all, [are rooted in
trends and actions already under way that]{.underline} only [appear to
be **gathering momentum**]{.underline} at this moment. [Bills like the
**Innovation and Competition Act** enjoy]{.underline} near unanimous
[support]{.underline} among [**[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}** [and
**Republicans**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while strong majorities in both
parties [favor [**increased funding** of Pentagon]{.mark} spending o[n
**China-oriented weaponry**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With few
exceptions---Senator Bernie Sanders among them---no one in the upper
ranks of government is saying: Slow down. Don't launch another Cold War
that could easily go hot.

"[It is **distressing** and **dangerous**," as Sanders
wrote]{.underline} recently in Foreign Affairs, "[that a fast-growing
consensus is emerging]{.underline} in Washington [that views the
US-Chinese relationship as a]{.underline} zero-sum economic and
[**military struggle**.]{.underline}" At a time when this planet faces
ever more severe challenges from climate change, pandemics, and economic
inequality, he added that "the prevalence of this view will create a
political environment in which the cooperation that the world
desperately needs will be increasingly difficult to achieve."

In other words, we [[Americans face an **existential
choice**]{.underline}: [Do we]{.underline}]{.mark} stand aside and
[[allow]{.underline}]{.mark} the "[fast-growing
[consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}" Sanders speaks of to shape national
policy, while abandoning any hope of genuine progress on climate change
or those other perils? Alternately, [[do w]{.mark}e]{.underline} begin
[[try]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [to exert **pressure** on Washington [to
adopt a]{.mark} more **[balanced relationship]{.mark}**]{.underline}
with China, one that would place at least as much emphasis on
cooperation as on confrontation? [[If we fail]{.mark} at this, [be
prepared]{.mark} in 2026]{.underline} or soon thereafter [[for]{.mark}
the **imminent onset** of a **[catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(possibly even nuclear) **[US-China [war]{.mark}.\]{.underline}**

**[Geography]{.underline}**

[If a US-China conventional conflict occurred]{.underline}, the United
States would have to project power into East Asia from an ocean away to
fight China in its backyard. [[China]{.mark} would [have]{.mark} a
"[home court advantage]{.mark}" in a future conventional war in East
Asia because of its large landmass]{.underline} and proximity to a
conflict taking place in the Taiwan Straits, Korean Peninsula, South
China Sea, or East China Sea. [But China is also much more [likely to
**suffer damage to its homeland**. US]{.mark} conventional military
[concepts]{.mark} for operations against China [tend to]{.mark}
emphasize the need to [neutralize]{.mark} its [geographic advantages by
**attacking Chinese weapons**]{.mark}**, sensors,** and their
**supporting [infrastructure]{.mark} and logistics networks** [located

equivalent**]{.mark} conventional [warfighting concept]{.mark} to
**disarm US conventional power projection** capabilities with strikes on

[Together with the **alliance asymmetry**]{.underline} described above,
[this **[geographical asymmetry]{.mark}** also [contributes to]{.mark}
the asymmetrical [stakes]{.mark} in China's favor in the event of a

in China and **significant damage to its cities and infrastructure**.
The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates might [suffer damage to]{.mark} its

**[damage]{.mark} its [great power status]{.mark}** in the Western

accept high costs]{.mark} and risks to defend its aims in a US-China
war]{.underline}.36 [The United States has [compensated]{.mark} for
these asymmetrical stakes [with]{.mark} a **[more capable nuclear

[China and the United States are **[both]{.mark} in the midst of
[modernizing]{.mark}** their [nuclear arsenals]{.mark} and **adding
capabilities** that **concern the other**. In the early 2010s, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [embarked on a]{.mark} US\$1.2 trillion
**[nuclear modernization]{.mark}** program over the next three
decades.]{.underline} More recently, the United States has enhanced its
non-strategic nuclear weapons, primarily to deter a perceived Russian
willingness to use nuclear weapons first in a limited manner. The 2018
Nuclear Posture Review called for low-yield, submarine-launched
"supplemental capabilities" to enhance US options for limited nuclear
strikes.17 The United States has also enhanced its missile defense
capabilities, primarily to counter North Korean nuclear missiles. It
plans to increase the number of its ground-based mid-course interceptors
for homeland missile defense from 44 to 64, indicated that it would
study options for space-based missile defense, and tested its SM-3 Block
IIA interceptors on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the
first time.18 [The US modernization plan, [supplemental
capabilities]{.mark}, and growing homeland [missile defenses]{.mark} are
frequently [cited by]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese [[**experts** as
evidence of]{.mark} **a [destabilizing US pursuit of nuclear
superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19

[Five aspects of China's nuclear modernization, coupled with a
perception of more assertive Chinese behavior, **generate concern in the
United States**. First, [China]{.mark} has **[deployed two new
ICBMs]{.mark}**, the DF-41, China's first road-mobile missile armed with
a multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV), and the
DF-31AG, a delivery system with improved mobility that is believed to
carry a single warhead. Second, China has fielded a [new]{.mark}, more
[accurate]{.mark} and mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile
([IRBM]{.mark}), the dual-use DF-26]{.underline}. The US government also
worries that China is exploring the option of fielding [**[low-yield
nuclear warheads]{.mark}** in the future]{.underline}.20 [Third, China
is [moving toward]{.mark} a **[full nuclear triad]{.mark}**]{.underline}
for the first time, although its air and sea legs are much less
survivable than its land-based missile force.21 Fourth, the Pentagon
estimates that [China's current stockpile of 200--300 nuclear
[warheads]{.mark} will [at least double]{.mark} as these new delivery
systems are fielded. Fifth, China is acquiring capabilities that could
enable it to shift to a launch-on-warning alert status in the future. It
has received Russian assistance with its early warning system and is
building out a space-based early warning architecture]{.underline}.22
[US reports and officials indicate that China might already keep some
portion of its nuclear force on day-to-day alert]{.underline}.23

[Five aspects of China's nuclear modernization generate concern in the
US]{.underline}

These capabilities developments are fueling concerns that [[China is
moving away from]{.mark} its nuclear
**[n]{.mark}**o-**[f]{.mark}**irst-**[u]{.mark}**se policy and
retaliatory posture [because they **give Beijing better options** to
threaten **nuclear first use**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But many aspects of
China's arsenal modernization pre-date Beijing's more ambitious foreign
policy in recent years and reflect concerns about the adequacy of
China's retaliatory force five to ten years ago.24 Other developments,
such as its intermediate-range DF-26 missile and nuclear-capable bombers
have a range of applications, which include conventional and nuclear
retaliatory strikes,25 as well as limited nuclear first use.
Organizational efficiencies and inter-service competition also play a
role in China's pursuit of these new systems.26

#### [TECH SHIFTS]{.underline} and [CULTURAL PROMISES]{.underline} cause war.

John **Dobson 21**, prestigious British foreign policy diplomat under
the Major administration, 4/3/2021, \"Is a war between U.S. and China
over Taiwan inevitable?,\"
https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/world/war-u-s-china-taiwan-inevitable,

'[[China considers]{.mark} establishing]{.underline} full control [over
[Taiwan to be its **number one priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}", said
Admiral John Aquilno during a Congressional hearing in March confirming
him as the next commander of US forces in the Pacific. "We ought to be
prepared today as in my opinion this problem is much closer to us than
most think." Retired General H.R. McMaster agrees. "[Taiwan is the
**[most significant flashpoint]{.mark}**]{.underline} now [that could
lead to a **large scale war**]{.underline}", said the former US National
Security Adviser last month.

For the past four decades, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [has [played a **critical role** in
deterring China]{.mark}]{.underline} from using force against Taiwan, as
Beijing cannot be sure that the US would stand aside in the face of
Chinese aggression. [Similarly, the [US has deterred Taiwan from
seeking]{.mark} **formal [independence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as
**Taipei** cannot be certain that the US would come to its
**defence**]{.underline} should it provoke a Chinese assault. Taiwan has
long been the most volatile issue between the US and China and both
sides have avoided war by leaving unsettled the question of who actually
owns the island.

So, is this "**[[constructive ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}**", as
President Joe Biden likes to call it, [[finally coming to an
end]{.underline}]{.mark}? Is an increasingly more assertive President Xi
Jinping about to pursue his aim to retake what he views as his country's
lost territory? Standing in his way are the US Pacific Fleet and
Taiwanese voters who have twice elected a leader who rejects the claim
that both sides are part of "one China".

But [why is **Taiwan**]{.underline} so [important to
Beijing]{.underline}? You have to go back to 1895 and the [humiliating
[defeat of China's **Qing dynasty** in losing Taiwan]{.mark} to
**Japan**]{.underline} to understand why
**[[reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the island with mainland
China [[has been a]{.mark} **rallying [cry]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
generations of Chinese. The current tensions date back to the Chinese
Civil War in 1949, when American ally Chiang Kai-shek and his
Nationalists abandoned the mainland to Mao Zedong's Communists and
established the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan. [Washington
recognised Chiang as China's **rightful leader** until]{.underline}
former President Richard [Nixon]{.underline} in 1979 [established formal
**diplomatic relations**]{.underline} with the communist government in
Beijing. It was in the spirit of China "becoming one of us", that
Washington recognised the People's Republic (PRC) as the sole legal
government of China, without clarifying its position on Taiwan's
sovereignty. Constructive ambiguity was born and Taiwan gradually
transformed itself into a de facto independent democracy without
formally declaring independence.

Since then, [Taiwan has become one of the world's **most successful**
societies]{.underline}. A flourishing democracy governed by the rule of
law, it holds fair and free elections, protects the political and human
rights of its citizens, has an unfettered and competitive media,
endorses religious diversity, and is a responsible international actor.
Compare all this with the autocratic and shameful PRC, and it will be
obvious why the population of 23 million are so reluctant to back
re-unification. The figures speak for themselves. Last year, following
the presidential elections which recorded an impressive 75% voter
turnout, a survey revealed that 79.7% of those polled said that
democracy was the best system of government for Taiwan.

With a high-tech (Taiwan dominates the world's market in microchip
technology) and sophisticated business culture, Taiwan became Asia's
top-performing economy in 2020, outgrowing the PRC for the first time.
It came as strong global demand for the island's tech exports outweighed
the modest hit from Covid-19 (911 confirmed infections and 8 deaths to
date), producing a 2.98% growth, by comparison with PRC's 2.58%.

So it's not surprising that a vibrant and wealthy society, with a GDP
per capita almost three times that of the PRC is unenthusiastic about
re-joining the mainland. Until recently, the former ruling party, the
Kuomintang favoured closer ties with Beijing and eventual reunification,
but China's recent brutal actions in Hong Kong gave the Taiwanese a
glimpse of their possible future. In his 2019 New Year's Day message, Xi
Jinping demanded that Taiwan look to the "one country two systems"
approach as a model for future relations, but after the recent brutal
crackdown in Hong Kong and Xi's ratting on its "two systems" treaty, the
Taiwanese people gave a resounding "No thanks". In any case, young
people in Taiwan have no emotional attachment to the past and want to
preserve the only way of life they have known.

Without any possibility of a willing Taiwan re-joining the mainland, the
only option left for Beijing to achieve its aim is to take the island by
military force. Even Deng Xiaoping, Xi's less aggressive predecessor,
said in 1984 "If the problem (of Taiwan) cannot be solved by peaceful
means, then it must be solved by force." So is Xi making preparations
for military action?

You might think so from the amount of Chinese military activity in the
region. Last year, 380 incursions by Chinese military aircraft into
Taiwan's airspace were recorded. Only last week, [more than **20 Chinese
military [aircraft]{.mark}**]{.underline}, some [**[nuclear
capable]{.underline}**, [conducted exercises simulating an
operation]{.underline}]{.mark} [against **US warships**]{.underline} off
the island's coast. Two months earlier, Chinese fighter jets and bombers
had simulated missile attacks on the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft
carrier, spending two days flying in and out of Taiwan's air-defence
zone, just days after Joe Biden was inaugurated as US President.

And it's not just in the air. A year ago, China sailed one of its two
aircraft carriers (two more, both nuclear powered, are being built) in a
show of force through the Taiwan Straits, one of the world's most
heavily militarised areas. [**[China's]{.mark} naval [forces]{.mark}**
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} hugely [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} over
the past decade, even [[**overtaking** the US.]{.underline}]{.mark} For
the past five years the country produced five times as many ships per
year as the US Navy. The [Chinese navy is]{.underline} now [projected to
have more than **550 ships** and submarines **by 2030**, while the **US
navy struggles** to figure out how to get **350**]{.underline}. Many of
the [ships being built by Beijing are **amphibious warfare
[vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [coupled with]{.mark} an
[expanding **marine**]{.mark} **corp[s]{.mark}**, would [play a
**critical role** in]{.mark} any]{.underline} possible
[**[invasion]{.mark}** of Taiwan.]{.underline}

But would it actually be in Beijing's interests to carry out a full
invasion? Although possible, this option would involve enormous risks,
not just to Taiwan but also to China, whose image around the world would
suffer a catastrophic decline. The United States would also face the
dilemma of whether to intervene, potentially sparking a war between two
superpowers. China will probably judge that the costs of violent
confrontation of this kind would be too high, compared to the benefits,
leaving an invasion as a last resort.

A more likely scenario would be China's use of military power to control
access to the island by air and sea, effectively affirming sovereign
control over Taiwan, while allowing the people to run their own affairs.
With the US sending large amounts of weapon systems to Taiwan which
theoretically could be used against China, Beijing could argue that this
action is simply analogous to the United States' action against Cuba in
1962. The groundwork for this "quarantine" scenario was laid in January
this year when China passed a new law allowing its coastguard ships to
use "all necessary means" against foreign vessels, and to board and
inspect such vessels in waters claimed by Beijing.

A third scenario is that [China demonstrates its **power** and
**intentions** by invading]{.underline} one or more of the many offshore
islands controlled by **[Taiwan]{.underline}**---the "Crimea" option.
This could be Taiping Island in the Spratly group, or the Pratas islands
(also called Dongsha) closer to China and Taiwan, or perhaps the Penghu
Islands (also called the Pescadores) nearer Taiwan. Right off-shore of
mainland China are Kinmen and Matsu islands, both with significant
populations of thousands of people, which would be the simplest to
invade. [[Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} could be [[tempted]{.mark} [to
gamble that]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**Taiwanese [defenders]{.mark}**
of these islands [would **not fight**]{.mark} and simply **capitulate**,
making this option a **low risk** activity.]{.underline} But what would
China have achieved in this scenario? Rather than settling the
underlying issue of Taiwan's sovereignty, they might have only
aggravated it.

So how likely is it that China will use any of these scenarios against
Taiwan? Many prominent analysts believe that a crisis over the island is
brewing and that the chances of war are highly likely. The commander of
the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson, told a Senate
committee this year that he expects [[action in the next **six
years**]{.mark} **or sooner**]{.underline}. However, other experts
believe that Beijing will only apply pressure on Taiwan just below the
threshold of triggering military response from the US, but sufficient to
convince the population of Taiwan that they have no choice but to be
part of China.

A Changing Landscape

[A more **contentious US-China** political relationship has **coincided
with**]{.underline} unrelated [**trends in nuclear politics** to
accentuate longstanding concerns about nuclear risks in that
relationship. **[Intensifying]{.mark} US-China [competition]{.mark}**
[undermines]{.mark} both countries' [trust in]{.mark} each other's
[assurances about]{.mark} their defensive **nuclear
[intentions]{.mark}** and [encourages **worst-case interpretations**
of]{.mark} each other's [behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 [US-China
competition is [**playing out** across]{.mark} all aspects of the
bilateral relationship, from **[tech]{.mark}nology [supply
chains]{.mark}** to **international organizations and [military]{.mark}
capabilities**. The 2017 US National Security Strategy proclaimed that
"China **seeks to displace** the United States in the Indo-Pacific
region, **expand the reaches** of **its state-driven economic model**,
and reorder the region in its favor]{.underline}."7 [The 2019 Chinese
defense white paper countered that the **United States** "is **engaging
in tech**nological and institutional **innovation in pursuit** of
absolute **military superiority**]{.underline}."8 [[Both countries
**perceive**]{.mark} **each other's [nuclear postures]{.mark}** and
policies [through this **competitive lens**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark} also [view each
other as]{.mark} more **[likely to jettison]{.mark}** policies of
**[nuclear restraint]{.mark}** because of their [recent **willingness to
abandon**]{.mark} longstanding [principles]{.mark} in other areas of
foreign policy. The US government's [relaxation of]{.mark} rules on
official [communications with Taiwan]{.mark} in 2021 might [add
to]{.mark} Chinese [expectations that self-imposed limits on]{.mark} the
**[US missile defense]{.mark}** architecture **[will be]{.mark}
similarly [relaxed]{.mark}**.9 [China's]{.mark} about-face on its
[stance **against**]{.mark} **the [deployment]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
military [forces abroad]{.mark} in 2017, [when]{.mark} it
**[established]{.mark} a [military base]{.mark}** in Djibouti, could
[give]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates additional **[reasons
to anticipate]{.mark}** that [China's]{.mark} **nuclear
[n]{.mark}**o-**[f]{.mark}**irst-**[u]{.mark}**se policy will
[suffer]{.mark} a [similar fate]{.mark}]{.underline}.10

[The US and China view each other as more likely to jettison policies of
nuclear restraint]{.underline}

[**US-Russia [arms control]{.mark}** has unraveled in recent years,
which [increases **China's wariness of**]{.mark} nuclear
[agreements]{.mark} with the United States and adds to [**anxieties**
about]{.mark} the [adequacy of its]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 [Pointing to Russian **[treaty
violations]{.mark}** and the [lack of constraints on]{.mark} Chinese
[land-based]{.mark} theater-range [missiles]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **[pulled out of]{.mark}** the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces Treaty (**[INF]{.mark}**)]{.underline} in 2019.12 [In 2020, the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [withdrew from]{.mark} the **[Open
Skies]{.mark} Treaty**,]{.underline} which permitted the United States
and Russia to fly over each other's territory to verify that no military
preparations for an attack are underway.13 [It initially [insisted on
Chinese participation]{.mark} in strategic nuclear arms control as a
pre-condition for extending the existing New START treaty until 2026 and
negotiating a follow-on treaty to replace it. [Given]{.mark} the **[lack
of]{.mark} a concrete** US [proposal for **trilateral arms control
taking into account**]{.mark} the **[discrepancy in arsenal
sizes]{.mark}** between China, the United States and Russia, [the
**demand for Chinese participation** seemed]{.mark} more [like an
**excuse to weaken** US-Russia arms]{.mark} control **[than a genuine
effort to engage China]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14

US interest in engaging China in arms control is likely to endure. The
Biden administration extended the New START treaty in its first days in
office without Chinese participation, but has also indicated its desire
to "pursue arms control to reduce the dangers from China's modern and
growing nuclear arsenal."15 Trust in the United States as an arms
control partner will take time to rebuild, even with the Biden
administration's greater commitment to such agreements. [In October
2020, the Director-General of the Arms Control Department at China's
Foreign Ministry, Fu Cong, remarked, "the fact that the [US]{.mark} has
[withdrawn from]{.mark} all these [arms control treaties]{.mark} and
international agreements has seriously **[undermined]{.mark} the
[credibility]{.mark}** of the United States]{.underline} as a
negotiator."16

### 2NC -- Relations

#### [DECLINING RELATIONS]{.underline} make war [structurally inevitable]{.underline}.

Kevin **Rudd 22**, global president of the Asia Society and former prime
minister of Australia, 4/4/2022, \"A U.S.-China War Would Dwarf the
Destruction in Ukraine. Both Sides Must Act Now to Avoid It,\"
https://time.com/6164184/how-us-china-avoid-war/, sg

[War between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and
China [is not inevitable]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} U.S.-China
[relations continue to spiral downward]{.underline}, their strategic
**[relationship]{.underline}** adrift and [buffeted by growing **global
crises**]{.underline}. [Muddling]{.underline} through [will be wholly
insufficient to avoid **conflict**]{.underline}. [To avoid sleepwalking
into a **war**, both **countries** must construct]{.underline} a joint
strategic framework to maintain the **[peace]{.underline}**---and
quickly.

In my new book, The Avoidable War: the Dangers of a Catastrophic
Conflict between the US and Xi Jinping's China, I offer one such
framework, which I call "managed strategic competition." The idea is
relatively simple.

First, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China** must have a clear, **granular understanding** of each other's
irreducible strategic redlines]{.underline} in order to help prevent
conflict through miscalculation. [Each side must be persuaded to
conclude that enhancing strategic **predictability
advantages**]{.underline} both countries, [strategic
deception]{.underline} is futile, [and]{.underline} strategic surprise
[is just **plain dangerous**]{.underline}. This will require a focused,
detailed diplomatic understanding on Taiwan.

Second, [both countries must then embrace the reality of their
**competition**---that is, to channel]{.underline} their [strategic
rivalry into a competitive race to enhance their **military**,
**economic**, and **technological** **capabilities**]{.underline}.
Properly [constrained]{.underline}, such [competition can deter **armed
conflict**]{.underline} rather than tempt either side to risk everything
by prosecuting a dangerous and bloody war with unpredictable results.
Such strategic competition would also enable both sides to maximize
their political, economic, and ideological appeal to the rest of the
world. The [**strategic rationale** would be that the most competitive
**national system**]{.underline} would ultimately prevail by becoming
(or remaining) the world's foremost superpower and eventually shaping
the world in its image. May the best system win. And I'm confident which
one I'd bet on

Third, this [**framework** would create the **political space**
necessary for the two countries to continue to engage in **strategic
cooperation**]{.underline} in the areas where their national interests
align. These spheres include: climate change, preventing the next
pandemic, and maintaining global financial stability

Finally, [for this **compartmentalization**]{.underline} of the
relationship to have any prospect for success[, it would need to be
carefully]{.underline} and continuously [managed by]{.underline} a
dedicated matching of cabinet-level [**senior officials** on both
sides]{.underline}. For the U.S., this also means any such [framework
would need **bipartisan buy-in**]{.underline} so it could withstand the
turbulence of domestic politics. For a priority this important, this
should by no means be impossible.

[This **approach** will face **criticism** in both **Washington** and
**Beijing** for not being sufficiently sensitive to each side's national
interests.]{.underline} To some in Washington, it will smack of
appeasement. This is false: cold, realistic deterrence is at the core of
any comprehensive strategy toward China. Meanwhile many in Beijing will
argue it doesn't sufficiently account for China's core interests on
Taiwan, and broader national pride. But as Moscow just learned in
Ukraine, war and economic devastation would suit China's interests far
less.

Ultimately, my challenge to critics of managed strategic competition,
and [putting **guardrails** to the **U.S.-China
relationship**]{.underline}, is simple: Come up with something better.
There is little time to waste.

sg

WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK?

Former U.S. President Donald [[**Trump** ushered in a]{.mark} more
[**confrontational era** in]{.mark} **U.S.-China
[relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [Biden has]{.underline} largely
[maintained his **predecessor's** approach to **Beijing**]{.underline},
albeit with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The
[[U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} government [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} for
decades [[been concerned by]{.mark} **China's
[mercantilism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, rapid [**military
[modernization]{.mark}**[, and **illiberal approach**]{.mark} to
**h**]{.underline}uman **[r]{.underline}**ights, but it had held out
hope that China might liberalize through increasingly robust contact
with the rest of the world. That has not happened, and [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
others have [[lost patience]{.mark} with China's]{.underline} state
**[capitalist system]{.underline}**, [**militarization** of the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
[and]{.underline} increasingly [**authoritarian
governance**.]{.underline}

But [[Beijing is not backing down]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite facing
pronounced international pushback during the pandemic, [Xi has
become]{.underline} even [more confident [in China's **economic
system**,]{.mark} **governance [model]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} approach to **[international
[affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "Time and momentum are on China's
side," he argued last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts
accuse the party of overconfidence. At the same time, Chinese [officials
are]{.underline} increasingly [looking askance]{.underline} at their
U.S. counterparts. Many appear to believe that the United States, though
still a formidable power, is in the early stages of an inevitable
decline. Just as China resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of
Asian nations, Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved
racial justice issues, income inequality, and political polarization
will catalyze an irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and
across the globe.

Complicating matters further, the [U.S. and Chinese publics
are]{.underline} increasingly [**distrustful** of each
other]{.underline}. A whopping [89 percent of **[American
respondents]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a recent survey from the Pew
Research Center [[consider China a competitor]{.underline}]{.mark} or
enemy, [while around two-thirds of [Chinese respondents view the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
[[unfavorably]{.underline}]{.mark} or very unfavorably. Such negative
mutual perceptions would likely hamper each side's ability to
recalibrate its approach to the other.

Finally, the [two sides' **divergent framings** of the relationship are
[contributing to]{.mark} the **ongoing
[stalemate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Discussions with high-level Chinese
scholars and former government officials have revealed that [**Beijing**
prefers to define the **bilateral relationship**]{.underline} as a
peaceful coexistence guided, [by **shared principles**]{.underline}
consensus, and possible cooperation. [China is frustrated that the
United States is more focused on competing]{.underline} with and
confronting Beijing. In Washington, however, great power rivalry,
defined more by competition and confrontation than cooperation, has
become the central framework for bilateral ties.

HOW HAVE THESE DIFFERING VIEWS AFFECTED POLICYMAKING?

The [pronounced turn in **U.S. policy** toward China]{.underline},
beginning with the Trump administration, [has not led to
**self-reflection**]{.underline} on the part of Beijing. Chinese
[scholars]{.underline} and experts initially [appeared]{.underline}
somewhat **[surprised]{.underline}** that many of the economic,
security, and technology policies that Beijing has pursued for years
have recently precipitated robust policy responses from the United
States. The [**ruling [party]{.mark}** [believes that]{.mark} [it
is]{.mark} merely [continuing down the **same path** it
established]{.mark}]{.underline} some years back, [which has led to
its]{.underline} attributing the [[downturn in the]{.mark} **bilateral
[relationship]{.mark}**]{.underline} solely [to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

[[Chinese]{.mark} government [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} appear to
[[believe the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[**[s']{.underline}** [goal is to
"**suppress**" **China**]{.underline}]{.mark}**['s rise]{.underline}**.
[[They cite]{.mark} the]{.underline} Trump [administration's policies,
as well as Biden's **[AUKUS]{.mark}** submarine pact [and the
**Quad**]{.mark}**'s** [increasing **coordination**]{.mark}, as evidence
of Washington's desire to contain China]{.underline} and limit Beijing's
influence in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, many Chinese scholars and
experts view [**[U.S. restrictions]{.mark}** on]{.underline} sensitive
[tech]{.underline}nology [exports to China [as proof that the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[seeks to hamper its]{.underline}]{.mark} burgeoning **[[tech]{.mark}
sector]{.underline}**. Finally, [they see **U.S. complaints** about
**h**]{.underline}uman **[r]{.underline}**ights [violations]{.underline}
in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet [as disingenuous, given the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tate[s']{.underline} own
[problems with racial justice and homelessness]{.underline}, as well as
its high levels of wealth and income inequality. In short, [China sees
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as a declining
power that is attempting to keep a **rising China** from
overtaking]{.underline} it.

The United States, as expected, has a very different view of bilateral
dynamics. [[Washington blames]{.underline}]{.mark} the downturn in
relations on [China's increasing **assertiveness**]{.underline} abroad
and repressiveness at home. U.S. officials are concerned that
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, through its support of authoritarian
regimes, [is [chipping away at the **l**]{.mark}]{.underline}iberal
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rder and trying to create "a world safe for
autocracy"; that its continued [military
[modernization]{.mark}]{.underline} and interest in building bases in
Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, and the United Arab Emirates [[will allow
Beijing to challenge Washington's]{.mark} **security
[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and that its state capitalist,
mercantilist system threatens the rules-based economic order. [Beijing's
**incarceration** of]{.underline} around 1 million
**[Uighurs]{.underline}** and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang,
[increasing]{.underline}ly strict online **[censorship]{.underline}**,
[and **prosecution** of dissidents have]{.underline} further [fueled
Washington's **desire**]{.underline} to enact more aggressive responses.

run from trade and technological development to human rights in Hong
Kong and Xinjiang to the future of Taiwan. The [lack of agreement
underscored the reality that the problems between the two countries
appear largely **intractable**]{.underline}, despite an urgent need for
coöperation on issues such as climate change.

I recently spoke by phone with Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in
China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in
Washington, D.C., about his view of the summit. During our conversation,
which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed whether to
think about the Chinese-American relationship as zero-sum, Xi Jinping's
refusal to leave China during the past twenty-one months, and why a
conflict over Taiwan may be less imminent than many in Washington fear.

The fact that the expectations of the meeting were simply that they have
the meeting shows how far the relationship has deteriorated over a
relatively short period of time. And so, while undoubtedly it's
important that we are now seeing the senior-most-level dialogue, when we
think about whether this marks an inflection point as the end of the
cold war, the low expectations both sides were setting were actually a
sign that the fault lines are quite deep and extensive, and that this is
going to be a very long process of finding very limited areas of
coöperation amid a deep sea of tensions in key areas of rivalry. So it
marks in a more profound way that we are now deeply into---or officially
into---an entirely new era of U.S.-China relations.

How would you characterize the era? You just used the phrase "cold war,"
even if it doesn't seem quite like the U.S.-Soviet relationship between
1945 and 1991.

We probably don't want to spend the whole time talking about Cold War
analogies, but I would just say that no historical analogy is perfect,
and, like Churchill said of democracy, the Cold War is the worst
possible historical analogy except for all the others. It's not exactly
a replay of Soviet-U.S. competition. But it is a multidimensional
competition bordering on rivalry between two great powers that is likely
to endure for some time, so the broad outlines of "cold war" at least
help us begin thinking about some of the things we need to do to manage
the relationship. My fear is that, by fighting off Cold War analogies,
we are just leaving ourselves in more inchoate and vague territory, and
what that leads to is issues like Taiwan continuing to spiral out of
control without adopting some Cold War thinking about how to put in
crisis-management mechanisms and confidence-building measures. It's a
muscle we haven't flexed in some time. That's the limited appeal of the
analogy.

What are those measures to prevent things from spiralling out of
control? It appeared that the American side seemed to be saying that,
even though we have all these issues, this isn't a zero-sum game. Do you
see it that way?

I think actually that one of the outcomes of the meeting---making sure
that Xi Jinping is as in person as we are going to get him for the time
being---is to now begin to strap the direction of the relationship to
his own personage. What had happened before is that he was relatively
aloof. And that meant you had this "wolf warrior" army underneath him,
and it felt like the relationship was spiralling without him putting his
own name and legacy on the line. I think one of the smart moves about
getting him to the table is he has a vested interest in managing this
because it is strapped to his back.

I think it's true that it is not zero-sum, but there are areas of both
zero-sum and positive-sum. And one of the challenges we have is that we
speak of it as "a competition," but really it is multiple competitions.
We are going to see areas, like in green technology, where we are vying
against each other, but it could actually yield very positive benefits
for both sides, because the pie may not get bigger, but it gets greener
and better for everybody. There are areas in technological development
where we do and probably should think about this in terms of zero-sum,
where advances in some technology come at a stark cost to the other
side.

Realist logic dictates that there are going to be key components about
regional dominance that are not positive-sum. Either China is the
hegemon in East Asia, or the United States is. But that is quite a
constricted vision of the relationship between the two countries. There
are others where they can be zero-sum, but we have to get them back on
track. Trade is a good example of this. We have, since 2016, begun to
think about trade more through a national-security lens, and as a matter
of exacting leverage on the other side, which gets away from areas of
economic integration, which have positive-sum, pie-expanding benefits to
both populations. We want to make sure the rivalrous elements of the
relationship don't crowd out the coöperative elements.

What are some of those zero-sum areas which are most concerning?

At the most abstract level, and very starkly, and here [I do see
**echoes** of the **Cold War**, we have some version of **ideological
competition**]{.underline}, but it is a really interesting, unique,
updated one. [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [is now stating that China's
political system is demonstratively **superior** to Western
democracies]{.underline} in its ability to deliver practical governance
outcomes, and so the narrative is, "[Our system is better]{.underline}
than yours, and [Western democracy is a path to **infighting**,
polarization, and **institutional atrophy**.]{.underline}" That is an
interesting new development. For a long time, we looked down our nose at
the Chinese political system as being sort of a backwater holdout of
twentieth-century Communism, and I think Beijing has taken that to heart
and spent a concerted amount of time trying to upgrade and revitalize
the governance system so much that it can outcompete the West. So, at a
high discourse level, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and China are both]{.underline}, for their own
reasons, in [speaking to their own domestic and international audiences,
framing this as a competition between]{.underline}, in Xi's mind,
[**effective vs. ineffective governance**, and]{.underline}, in the U.S.
mind, **[authoritarianism vs. democracy]{.underline}**. [It's difficult
to see how we find a new coexistence with those narratives]{.underline},
because both sides are tying this to basic legitimacy

More practically speaking, in terms of regional strategic dominance,
[China is fighting **to end U.S. primacy**]{.underline} in the region,
[and the U.S. is fighting **to maintain its primacy**]{.underline} in
the region. And that includes an ability to shape outcomes right off
China's shore. This is an [intolerable **zero-sum**
situation]{.underline}, and [China is working actively to change the
s]{.underline}tatus [quo]{.underline}. That explains its island-building
activities, and that explains the pace of its actions in the Taiwan
Strait. And in some ways I think the United States is living as if it is
1993, as if we hold the same amount of global aggregate power that we
did then, and we can still maintain a status quo that held for a good
chunk of the post-1945 period, without recognizing a structural shift in
power. We haven't found a way to come to terms with that which is also
politically satisfying domestically.

Other areas of zero-sum are in very specific areas of technology. Given
that now almost all critical and emerging technologies are also dual
use, we are in a really new world where it is hard to separate
commercial and strategic technologies. We are going to be able to find
areas where they don't need to be seen as zero-sum, but right now any
innovative advance in A.I. or semiconductors is seen by the other side
as zero-sum, which is why there is such an intense skirmish over who can
control them moving forward.

In terms of Taiwan, what types of markers would or wouldn't be helpful?

Gosh. It's a hard one. I don't have a pithy answer for this. Right now,
we are in a hysteria in the United States over what I think is the
incorrect analytical judgment that Xi is on the precipice of invading
Taiwan. If that is your base analytical judgment, it really makes it
hard to be thinking calmly.

Why do you think the judgment is wrong?

Xi has been in power for about ten years, and we have gotten to see some
key attributes of how he views the world and how he governs. And one
thing I think we should all be able to agree on is that he is not
suicidal. If you hold as a basic proposition that the Communist Party
wants to stay in power, the next sentence cannot be, "And so Xi plans to
invade Taiwan, ninety miles off its shore, potentially involving a
nuclear superpower." The quickest way for Xi to facilitate his exit from
power, and to undermine nearly every other objective that he has for the
Communist Party, which he has articulated over and over again, is to
launch an invasion of uncertain outcome and uncertain duration.

On Monday, the Communist Party put out this big resolution on history.
It is the third time it has done so since 1945. There is a really
interesting line in there. When Beijing has talked about Taiwan, it has
typically said, "Time and momentum are on our side." In the history
resolution, which is now one of the highest-ranking documents in the
Party's hierarchy, it changes the wording to say, "Time and momentum are
always on our side." That is not the sort of messaging you would make
internally if you were hot to trot and saw a shrinking window of time on
Taiwan. I think the more realistic assessment is that Xi doesn't really
have a good strategy on Taiwan. No doubt he wants to take the island,
but right now the assessment of cost is too high. He is locked into a
longtime nationalist narrative of not being able to back down from
asserting authority over Taiwan, so you see escalating fights in the
region and cyberwarfare, but, on the other hand, when he gives speeches,
he basically messages not being in a big rush.

It seems like you are saying that [neither side has good **Taiwan**
options]{.underline}, and so, however imperfect the status quo, it could
really be worse, and we may be here for a long time.

Well, in a way, I think we are in a better position, but that could lead
to a fairly bad outcome. The **[trend lines]{.underline}** in terms of
public opinion in [Taiwan are moving away from any desire for
**reunification**]{.underline} with the mainland, and certainly after
events in Hong Kong you can understand why. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [continues to strengthen its relationship with
Taiwan. Support]{.underline} for Taiwan [is rising]{.underline} around
the world [as it comes under **China's bullying**]{.underline}. The
island's Democratic Progressive Party continues to marginalize the
K.M.T. \[The Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for more than fifty years,
adopted a friendlier posture toward the mainland after losing Taiwan's
second Presidential election, in 2000.\] So one can imagine us becoming
so successful that Xi feels like he needs to shift his assessment
because the window is closing

What did you make of Xi not attending the Glasgow conference? And to
what degree can the countries coöperate on climate change with these
other things going on?

On the first one, I think that the question is, What do we read from the
fact that Xi hasn't left the country in two years? What does that say
about his own assessment of his priorities? Although President Biden
tried to call him out by saying it showed insufficient concern for the
issue, I take it more as: this is still a Leninist party, which is
fairly conservative in many ways in terms of how it assesses risk, and
no senior leader, except for foreign-policy officials, has left the
country. So, given the zero tolerance on covid, and his domestic
political agenda, which is uniquely filled with important events between
now and next fall, I don't read too much into the fact that he didn't
show up.

On the issue of climate, I am not sure Beijing thinks about it in the
way we do, in terms of seeing rivalry and coöperation as being two
really distinct buckets, with one infringing on the other. I think
Beijing is more fluid in terms of how it thinks about the issues.
Fundamentally, it will work with the United States when it has
determined that doing so is in its own interest, not as a gesture of
good faith to the United States. So I think we probably gnash our teeth
a little more over the conflict-vs.-coöperation dichotomy.

How much similarity do you see between the Biden and Trump approaches to
China?

Actually, I think both Beijing and Washington are simultaneously rolling
out a strategy on the other country, but also fundamentally we don't
have a master arc for what the relationship is. Ten years ago, it was
easy to articulate what this was. It was about trade and economics and
globalization. Obviously that plank of the relationship was
delegitimized after 2016. And so now, if you were to ask the average
person the state of the relationship with China, they might struggle to
answer. I think even in Washington we are not entirely clear on what it
is going forward.

In China, as well, there is a shift in thinking about the long-term
relationship, and whether the United States can be trusted. Certainly
the actions and rhetoric near the end of the Trump Administration---like
Mike Pompeo's speech at the Nixon Library, all but calling for fomenting
regime change---well, we might know that was not a consensus, but these
remarks are all attributable to the United States, and I think that has
provoked a profound rethink of the relationship. That shows me that we
are going to have a prolonged period of volatility until we can tell a
new story about what the bilateral relationship is.

​​What's your sense of how much the Chinese regime thinks it can continue
its human-rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere without much cost, and
how much the Biden Administration is willing to make human rights an
issue where it will try to draw real lines?

I actually think the two are not separate, but interrelated, because the
willingness to draw lines assumes we have power to be able to
fundamentally alter the domestic trajectory in China, which is becoming
increasingly difficult, if not impossible. The [past several years have
shown how **deeply entrenched**]{.underline} the policies and approach
that have led to human-rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet and other
areas are in China's view of maintaining political stability and
national security. These run very, very deep. [China is a confident
power with **significant resources**.]{.underline} This is not the China
of 1995 or even 2005. So we have to be circumspect in terms of what we
can expect to accomplish in terms of outside pressure.

That being said, in 2017 [Beijing **denied** there were any
**concentration facilities** in Xinjiang]{.underline}. Then they said
they were not concentration camps but vocational training. Then they
said they shut them all down. That happened because the world began to
watch. And, although they continue to this day, it showed that China
cares about what the world thinks, and, when eyes are watching, it can
have a constraining effect, or at the margin minimize the extent of the
more horrific abuses, but not end all of them.

And the [Biden]{.underline} Administration?

They clearly want **[to invest]{.underline}** a lot [in human
rights]{.underline}. That's not the issue. The heart is there. The
question is really, What can you do about it? Are they going to go to
war? Are they going to invade? Of course not. I am being a bit flippant,
but, once you begin coming in from the absurd extremes, options begin to
shrink pretty quickly. But top-line attention from Biden himself, along
with concerted attention from the global community, can have an impact,
undoubtedly. [Pressure from the U.S. government is forcing companies to
remove their **op**]{.underline}eration**[s]{.underline}** and supply
chains [from Xinjiang]{.underline}. That is imposing a price on China.
The question is: Is it enough of a price that China will walk away from
this? No, and that goes back to my initial diagnosis. They think this is
an issue of separatism and extremism that threatens the stability of
China. It is going to be next to impossible to unseat that diagnosis
from Beijing.

#### War is coming by [2025]{.underline} -- [semi-conductor restraints]{.underline} AND exclusive [defense treaties]{.underline} cause jumps for Taiwan.

\"A US-China War Over Taiwan Appears Not Only Inevitable, But Imminent

Today, however, the **[territory]{.underline}** that [stands at the
**crossroads** of **geopolitical fixation**]{.underline} and
contestation, [is]{.underline} the island state of [Taiwan]{.underline}
-- according to recent Chinese and American behaviour.

[Barely [**two weeks** after]{.mark}]{.underline} the US, the UK and
Australia announced the formation of [**[AUKUS]{.mark}** -- a security
alliance]{.underline} between the three Anglosphere countries [to
contain]{.underline} and deter [Chinese **military
aggression**]{.underline} in Indo Pacific -- Taiwan's defence ministry
reported that a record [[56]{.mark} Chinese **military
[aircraft]{.mark}** [entered **Taiwan**]{.mark}**ese
airspace**]{.underline} on multiple occasions on 4 October, [which
followed the previous record set]{.underline} on both Friday and then
Saturday, with 38 and 39 aircraft reported, respectively.

This, according to Adam Ni, an Australian analyst of Chinese military
policy, "[[sends a message]{.underline}]{.mark} about Beijing's
determination **[[to claim]{.mark} Taiwan[, by
force]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if necessary", with the aim being "to
assert Beijing's power and show military muscle".

Tensions over Taiwan have escalated so quickly that US President Joe
Biden has reportedly deployed his top security advisor, Jack Sullivan,
to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in Switzerland next
week.

But, even if [the meeting]{.underline} successfully [lowers the
**temperature**, it will offer only a **temporary respite**]{.underline}
-- given that [both [superpowers are **mobilising**]{.mark}]{.underline}
their forces and allies [[for an **imminent**]{.mark} **shooting
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline} over Taiwan within the next decade or two,
that reunifying the breakaway island [[territory sits at the centre of
Beijing's desire to avenge its "**century of humiliation**", and]{.mark}
that it is at the **centre** of Washington [DC's **objective** to
maintain **primacy**]{.mark} over]{.underline} Indo Pacific, [a region
that will]{.underline} soon [account]{.underline} for the lion's share
of the [global economy]{.underline}.

The second piece to this confrontation is [Taiwan's [**semi-conductor
industry**, accounting for]{.mark} roughly [**75%** of the
world's]{.mark} integrated **circuit manufacturing [capacity]{.mark}**[,
with the US]{.mark} controlling **100%** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[key [chips]{.mark}]{.underline}** required [[to build
**semi-conductors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has led some analysts to
draw [parallels between China's current]{.underline} and future [need
for the tech]{.underline}nology [with **Japan's** need for
**oil**]{.underline} in the 1930s, [which led it to launch **military
action** across]{.underline} south-east Asia and [the
Pacific]{.underline} in 1941.

"In 2021, [[China is feeling]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly
[[**constricted** for]{.underline}]{.mark} a critical resource
([[**semi-conductors**), and **Beijing's**]{.mark} policy
[options]{.mark} for addressing this **problem might**]{.underline} seem
to [[converge with]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[expansionary
tendencies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and its long-term concerns over the
status of Taiwan," observed George Calhoun in a recent column for
Forbes.

Two years ago, in what would be his first major speech on Taiwan,
Chinese President **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping
[[warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**Taiwan's [reunification]{.mark}**
[was **inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, saying that "[we make no
promise to renounce the use of **force** and **reserve**]{.underline}
the option of [taking all necessary means]{.underline}" and that
"Taiwan's independence goes against the trend of history and will lead
to a dead end".

Earlier this week, Taiwan's Defence Minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said that
military [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} between China and Taiwan [[are
at their highest]{.mark} in **four decades**]{.underline}, warning that
[[Beijing will]{.underline}]{.mark} be in a position to [[launch a
**full**]{.mark}**-scale [invasion]{.mark}** [in
**2025**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "For the military, the current situation
is the grimmest in the more than 40 years since I joined the service,"
he told Parliament. "It is capable now, but it has to calculate what it
would cost, and what kind of outcome it wishes to achieve." He warned
that even a [single "**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}" or
"slight carelessness" [[could spark a]{.mark} **full-blown
[crisis]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

While nearly [the [entire]{.mark} **academic
[field]{.mark}**]{.underline} of international [relations
has]{.underline} long [[predicted war between]{.mark}]{.underline} a
rising [[China and a **declining US** is
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline} because great-power war typically
occurs at the "intersection of one hegemon's rise and another's decline"
-- otherwise known as Thucydides Trap -- a growing chorus of security
elites are arguing an inverse of this theory.

### 2NC -- AT: China Has NFU

Peter **Pry 20; S**taffer of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the

"China\'s \'no first use\' nuclear fiction", The Hill, 6/24/20,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/502503-chinas-no-first-use-nuclear-fiction

Many China experts in government and academia, and anti-nuclear
activists such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Federation
of American Scientists, appear not to be worried by China's rapidly
growing nuclear capabilities, because Beijing's official policy promises
that China will not be the first to employ nuclear weapons in a
conflict. [Beijing promises that its nuclear forces are for deterrence
and retaliation only, not for aggression.]{.underline} Western analysts
consistently fail to understand that, for both Beijing and Moscow,
[nuclear war plans are national security "crown jewels" that they try to
protect and conceal behind a bodyguard of lies and
disinformation]{.underline}. Trusting open sources and commentary ---
especially when they are intended to cast nuclear doctrine in the most
benign possible way --- is a big mistake. For example, during the Cold
War the USSR went to extraordinary lengths to misinform Western
policymakers and the public that Moscow had a nuclear "no first use"
doctrine. This was intended to conceal its real nuclear war plans ---
that we now know entailed a massive nuclear first strike early in a
conflict. The "no first use" disinformation campaign also was intended
to mobilize Western anti-nuclear activists, in and out of government, to
constrain U.S. nuclear programs and operational plans. [China's alleged
nuclear "no first use" doctrine, like the USSR's during the Cold War, is
almost certainly disinformation. "No first use" for China does not
withstand the test of common sense. No conservative military planner
would adopt "no first use" when China lacks ballistic missile early
warning system (BMEWS) radars and satellite early warning systems that
would enable China to launch on tactical warning]{.underline}. "No first
use" would doom China's nuclear deterrent to certain destruction by a
U.S. or Russian conventional or nuclear first strike, or to a nuclear
first strike by India. [China's nuclear posture, especially the lack of
early warning radars and satellites, is "use it or lose it," which
logically should drive Chinese military planners toward nuclear first
use --- indeed, toward surprise first use early in a crisis or conflict,
based on strategic warning.]{.underline} Regardless of China's "no first
use" declaration, it strains credulity that Beijing's political leaders
would adhere to such a policy if confronted with compelling political
and military intelligence of an imminent U.S. attack. Such strategic
warning was the basis for the former USSR's secret plans for a disarming
nuclear first strike under their VRYAN (surprise nuclear missile attack)
intelligence program, that nearly resulted in a nuclear apocalypse
during NATO's theater nuclear exercise Able Archer 83. Fortunately, at
least some U.S. military leaders are not as naïve as academics about
China's "no first use" pledge. Adm. Charles Richard, chief of U.S.
Strategic Command, testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee in
February that he could "drive a truck through China's 'no first use'
policy." [China's unprecedented rapid expansion of its nuclear and
missile capabilities is not consistent with a belief in "minimum
deterrence" and "no first use."]{.underline} It looks imitative of
Russia's policy seeking escalation dominance for nuclear diplomacy and
nuclear warfighting. Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, warned in May 2019: "[China is likely to at least
double the size of its nuclear stockpile in the course of implementing
the most rapid expansion and diversification of its nuclear arsenal in
China's history. ... China launched more ballistic missiles for testing
and training than the rest of the world combined."]{.underline} China's
political and military leaders often have threatened nuclear war. [In
2011, columnist Gordon Chang reported: "Former Chinese general Xu
Guangyu ... suggested China was planning a surprise missile attack on
the American homeland."]{.underline} The People's Liberation Army Second
Artillery Corps --- now the PLA Rocket Force, equivalent to U.S.
Strategic Command --- leaked a planning document, "Lowering the
Threshold of Nuclear Threats," that stipulated some conditions under
which, in response to U.S. conventional attacks, China would launch a
nuclear first strike. For example: "Targets that could draw such a
response include any of China's leading urban centers or its atomic or
hydroelectric power facilities." [China's military doctrine]{.underline}
--- including numerous examples of using nuclear EMP attack to win on
the battlefield, defeat U.S. aircraft carriers, [and achieve against the
U.S. homeland a surprise "Pearl Harbor" writ large --- is replete with
technical and operational planning consistent with a nuclear first
strike.]{.underline} Indeed, China's classification of nuclear EMP
attack in military doctrine as "electronic warfare" or "information
warfare" indicates that EMP is not even considered a form of nuclear
attack, but would be equivalent to non-nuclear EMP weapons and cyber
warfare. [In March, a panel of China's military experts threatened to
punish U.S. Navy ships for challenging China's illegal annexation of the
South China Sea by making an EMP attack]{.underline} --- one of the
options they considered least provocative because the crew would be
unharmed, but most effective because the ship would be disabled. Like
other evidence, this, too, suggests Beijing considers EMP attack as
something short of nuclear or even kinetic conflict, akin to "gray zone"
threats such as electronic and cyber warfare.

## Yes Counterforce

### 1NC -- Generic 

#### We'd respond with a devastating counterforce attack that would crush China

David J. **Lonsdale 19;** Director of the Centre for Security Studies at
the University of Hull, UK. 5/17/2019. "The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review:
A return to nuclear warfighting?" Comparative Strategy Volume 38, 2019
Pages 98-117

The important question is: [what objectives would the U.S. pursue within
a nuclear conflict]{.underline}, and how would they be achieved? It
appears [that **the primary objectives sought would be damage
limitation**]{.underline} (an important component of warfighting) and
the reestablishment of deterrence. This fits with the preliminary
qualifying statement to this section of the review, in which it is
stated that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in compliance with the
law of armed conflict.86 Indeed, [the NPR]{.underline} is at pains to
note that nuclear forces would only be used for defensive purposes. One
assumes that this [rules out counter-value targeting (deliberate attacks
against enemy population centers). **This leaves counterforce operations
as the only option. Strikes against** enemy nuclear forces and their
**command and control, in conjunction with** active ballistic missile
defenses (**BMD**), would help ensure damage limitation for the U.S. and
its allies]{.underline}.[87 A focus on counterforce options is
reminiscent of later Cold War strategy]{.underline}, when the U.S.
increasingly procured weapon systems with increased accuracy and
penetrative capability designed for warfighting. Indeed, [Lieber and
Press argue that **increases in accuracy and remote sensing have
enhanced the potency** of counterforce **options, to the point that
low-casualty counterforce options are possible for the first
time**]{.underline}.88 One can reasonably assume, although it is not
explicitly noted in the review, that the restoration of deterrence would
be achieved through a combination of intra-war deterrence by denial (as
noted above in relation to counter-escalation strategies) and punishment
for coercive purposes. Inclusion of the latter is premised on references
to "unacceptable consequences" resulting from nuclear attack elsewhere
in the NPR. 89 However, in the face of no counter-value targeting, it is
reasonable to question how these costs would be inflicted. There are
three possible answers, although none of them is discussed in the NPR.
First, it may be that the enemy values highly their nuclear forces; so
that the loss of them would inflict unacceptable costs. Alternatively,
there may be an unwritten assumption that counterforce strikes would
inevitably produce "bonus" counter-value damage. Much of the nuclear
force infrastructure (including command and control, airbases, etc.) is
within or near population centers. Thus, even a limited counterforce
strike is likely to have a significant detrimental effect on
counter-value targets. This assumption, however, is somewhat thrown into
question by [the stated desire to procure accurate limited-yield weapons
and to operate within the norms of the war convention. Low-yield
accurate weapons would be ideal for counterforce missions and would
minimize damage to counter-value target sets]{.underline}. [Thus,
**bonus damage** is likely to be limited]{.underline}. Finally, although
again not explicitly noted in the NPR, perhaps [there is a return to the
notion of attacking targets associated with political
control]{.underline}. Yet again, though, concerns over collateral damage
would likely restrict a campaign aimed at the means of political
control. We are, thus, left with many questions concerning how the
coercive effects of nuclear weapons would be administered. This is
problematic, for as Thomas C. Schelling eloquently noted, "The power to
hurt can be counted among the most impressive attributes of military
force." 90 It has to be concluded that the uncertainties in this area of
strategy reflect either a paradox or incomplete strategic thinking in
the NPR. Clarity on these matters would be welcome, especially as it
would enhance deterrence credibility still further. Although
countervailing is back on the agenda in the 2018 NPR, there is no
mention of prevailing in a nuclear conflict. Indeed, the review quotes
Defense Secretary Mattis, echoing the early thoughts of Brodie, that
nuclear war can never be won, and thus must never be fought.91 This is
both curious and disappointing from a warfighting perspective, and
speaks to the need for the further development of strategic thinking in
U.S. nuclear strategy under Trump. Damage limitation and the
reestablishment of deterrence are perfectly admirable goals within the
context of nuclear conflict. However, if the U.S. is to achieve its
objectives in a post-deterrence environment, it must have a
comprehensive theory of victory. Damage limitation and the
reestablishment of deterrence are limited negative objectives. They do
not provide a positive driving force for the use of nuclear weapons. To
reiterate, victory refers to a policy objective that must be achieved in
the face of the enemy. And, as Clausewitz reminds us, [**the** **will of
the enemy must be broken by destroying**]{.underline} his [**ability to
resist**, or putting]{.underline} him [in such a position
as]{.underline} his [defeat is inevitable]{.underline}.92 [If we
consider the conditions under which U.S. nuclear weapons could be used,
as stipulated by the 2018 NPR, then we can assume that an enemy power
(likely]{.underline} Russia, [China]{.underline}, North Korea, or a
state-sponsored terror group) [has launched a substantial attack on
either the U.S. or one of its allies]{.underline}. We can think in terms
of a Russian assault on the Baltic States, a North Korean attack on
South Korea, or [perhaps a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.]{.underline}
Alternatively, the U.S. may have been subjected to a substantial
strategic attack, involving either weapons of mass destruction
(including biological or chemical) or a crippling cyberattack. In any of
these scenarios, more expansive objectives would be required. As Lieber
and Press note, "In some cases, wars may be triggered by events that
compel U.S. leaders to pursue decisive victory, conquest, and/or regime
change." 93 Thus, in order to achieve its objectives, the U.S. would
variously need to: punish an aggressor to reinstate deterrence; defeat
enemy forces for damage limitation or to reclaim lost territory; and, in
the North Korean case, presumably overthrow a communist regime. In some
of these cases, damage limitation and the reestablishment of deterrence
would not be enough. Enemy forces would have to be defeated, removed,
destroyed, or coerced (to withdraw from allied territory). Any
operations in pursuit of these goals would need a theory of victory
built on a detailed understanding of the use of nuclear weapons in the
service of military objectives; i.e., nuclear warfighting. This could
include defeating enemy nuclear forces for force protection of U.S. and
allied conventional forces. Alternatively, U.S. nuclear forces may be
required to defeat regionally superior enemy conventional forces. And
yet, as previously noted, the NPR rules out a return to nuclear
warfighting. This is a significant disjuncture in U.S. nuclear strategy.
It is even more curious when one considers [the range of modern forces
the Trump administration seeks to acquire under the 2018
NPR.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- China Knows

#### American counterforce is a threat to Chinese strategists -- new installations and American warheads prove.

The Drivers of Force Structure and Problems of Mistrust

If China's efforts are not part of a broader shift in posture, what
explains the significant recent expansion of the Chinese nuclear
arsenal? The primary impetus is Beijing's continued fears over America's
intentions and perceived technological edge. [In particular, [Chinese
strategists seem]{.mark} increasingly [concerned about **American
counterforce**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} ballistic missile defense
[(BMD)]{.mark} [systems,]{.mark} which they allege [to represent an
American]{.mark} [attempt to achieve]{.mark} "[**absolute security**"
by]{.mark} [eliminating China's]{.mark} [ability to assure]{.mark}
[retali]{.mark}ation]{.underline}. The American nuclear modernization
program is an important element in China's calculus because, although it
does not quantitatively grow the size of the American arsenal, it
develops new delivery systems such as a new stealthy, [penetrating
cruise missile and strategic
bomber](https://warontherocks.com/2013/11/a-new-nuclear-air-launched-cruise-missile/) that
could enhance America's already significant counterforce capabilities.
[[These improvements]{.mark} [to America's]{.mark} nuclear [delivery
systems]{.mark} [complement]{.mark} further [improvements in

### 2NC -- Nuclear Triad

#### They're [three years away]{.underline} from the nuclear triad BUT [counterforcing now]{.underline} works.

**CACNP 20**, Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, "China's
Nuclear Inventory,"
<https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/China.pdf>, cy

How Many?

It is estimated that China has a stockpile of around 350 nuclear
warheads. [These weapons can be delivered by air, sea and land --
completing a **nuclear triad** once China's strategic **bombers are
deployed**.]{.underline} While Beijing has long focused on maintaining a
minimum deterrent, it is likely that its nuclear stockpile will increase
in the next few decades. Additionally, [if the United States continues
to expand and strengthen its missile defense program, China may modify
its nuclear posture to include a significantly larger nuclear force with
the potential to strike the United States.]{.underline}

Air

Historically, [the **air-based component** of the Chinese triad has
**been a low priority** for the nation]{.underline}. China currently
possesses a small number of air-based platforms for nuclear weapon
delivery, [but is expected to bring a **new strategic bomber** and
**air-launched ballistic missiles** into operation.]{.underline} That
may include the development of a new nuclear-capable subsonic strategic
stealth bomber, the Xian H-20, which could enter service [as early as
2025]{.underline}. This will be very similar to the U.S. B-2 bomber.

Sea

[China has four Jin-class **nuclear powered** ballistic **missile
submarines**]{.underline} (SSBN), with two more under construction.
[Each SSBN can carry up to 12 submarine-launched ballistic
missiles]{.underline} (SLBMs) known as JL-2. These missiles are believed
to have a range of 7,200 kilometers, which gives China the ability to
target Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, India and Russia from Chinese waters. [The
only way for **China** to **target** the continental **United States**
would be if the Jin-class **submarines** traveled **deep** into the
**Pacific Ocean**, but they would most likely **be noticed by U.S.**
Maritime **Patrol Aircrafts.**]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Subs

#### China's subs [fail miserably]{.underline} at second strike.

Foreseeable Future,\"

cy

Title: Why [**China's SSBN** Force Will **Fall Short** for the
Foreseeable Future]{.underline}

[China simply **cannot rely** on its SSBN force to act **as a reliable
second-strike** deterrent **against the United States.**]{.underline}

[Not all ballistic missiles submarines are built equal, and neither is
all **maritime geography**.]{.underline} In a recent article at the
Bulletin for Atomic Scientists, Owen Cote examines the boomer balance
between China and the United States in light of the long-running
competition between the United States and the USSR during the Cold War.
Cote suggests that [for the foreseeable future the **United States** can
rely on **technological** and **geographic advantages** that will keep
its own **deterrent secure**, while **putting China's at
risk.**]{.underline}

Cote offers a history of the undersea nuclear competition during the
Cold War. The United States Navy, first to deploy operational SSBNs,
soon became aware that its new submarines were detectable at long range
with the appropriate passive sonar technology. Having ascertained the
problem, [the U.S. Navy first took steps to make its SSBNs
quieter]{.underline} (and thus nearly [immune to Soviet
detection]{.underline}), and second [expanded its listening
capabilities]{.underline} such that it could more fully monitor Soviet
SSBNs. In consequence of technology, and because of certain geographic
advantages, [**U.S. boomers** could **hide effectively**]{.underline}
while Soviet boomers were under perpetual threat from U.S. Navy attack
boats.

The Soviets were aware of these problems, and did their best to resolve
them. As is well-known, the Soviets eventually decided on a "bastion"
strategy, using a large chunk of their fleet to protect SSBN patrol
areas. As Cote points out, the Soviet solution to the problem was
immensely costly in resources. The inability of Soviet boomers to
reliably hide meant that the Soviet Navy needed to use substantial
surface, air, and subsurface assets to keep the boomers protected. With
respect to detecting NATO boats, the Soviets lacked the geographic reach
to develop equally capable monitoring capabilities of their own.

Fast forward to today, and [the **technological gap** between **U.S. and
Chinese submarines** is as large or larger than the gap between the U.S.
and the USSR.]{.underline} More importantly[, the United States has
**huge advantages** in terms of its **ability to monitor** Chinese entry
into **the Pacific.**]{.underline} Although the technical details are
complex, [Chinese submarines cannot reliably reach patrol areas in range
of the larger part of the United States without being detected and
tracked by the United States]{.underline}. Moreover, the U.S. likely has
the political and diplomatic heft to maintain its access to the
chokepoints that hem the PLAN in. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
China does not now and will not in the projectable future have a way of
similarly monitoring the ingress and egress of U.S. subs.

[This leaves the Chinese]{.underline} in a position very similar to that
of the Soviet Union, with perhaps [an even **greater degree** of
**geographic constraint**.]{.underline} China could adopt a bastion
strategy, but as of yet there's no indication that the PLAN wants to
think of itself primarily as a defensive force. Indeed, its fleet
construction does not suggest ASW as the dominant mission.

And this means that for the foreseeable future, [China simply cannot
rely on its SSBN force]{.underline} to act as a reliable second-strike
deterrent against the United States. To be sure, as Cote points out the
SSBNs will remain an effective deterrent against India and other nuclear
powers. But [**even if** China **extends the range** of the missiles on
its boats, it will still **suffer severe disadvantages** in terms of
**basing** and **patrol ranges**.]{.underline} The U.S.SR could not dent
the U.S. advantage, and [it does not appear that China will be able to
**balance the equation**, either.]{.underline}

[During the Cold War, the [competition between]{.mark} **[submariners
and antisubmarine]{.mark} [warfare]{.mark}** operators [was
shrouded]{.mark} in secrecy, [but that]{.mark} history [is]{.mark}
finally [being revealed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We now know that
the United States was able to locate, and even track, Soviet SSBNs
during extended periods of the Cold War.67 [The core of **[U.S. ASW
efforts]{.mark}** [against the]{.mark} [Soviet Union]{.mark} [lay in a
series of]{.mark} [breakthroughs]{.mark} in passive sonar and signals
processing, as well as doctrine and tactics [to exploit]{.mark} those
[advances]{.mark}. Starting in the 1950s, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [deployed]{.mark} an expanding [network of]{.mark}
**[underwater hydrophones]{.mark}** designed [to]{.mark} identify and
[locate]{.mark} adversary [submarines.]{.mark} [Data]{.mark} from the
hydrophones were [transmitted across]{.mark} **undersea
[cables]{.mark}** [to onshore]{.mark} computing [facilitie]{.mark}s,
where powerful computers discerned the faint sounds of submarines from
ocean noise]{.underline}. Potential targets were then passed along to
aircraft and attack submarines (SSNs) for further location and tracking.
U.S. capabilities to track Soviet submarines leapt forward in the late
1960s and 1970s, as the United States deployed new attack submarines,
which were equipped with powerful sonars in their bows, towed sonar
arrays, and improved on-ship computing power, giving U.S. SSNs an
unprecedented combination of acoustic gathering and data processing
capabilities.68 The competition between Soviet SSBNs and the pack of
U.S. submarines, aircraft, and surface ships hunting them varied
throughout the Cold War. [There were periods in which [U.S. forces were
winning, **trailing every Soviet SSBN**]{.mark} on patrol, from port to
sea and back. In later periods, after discovering their vulnerability,
the Russians pulled their forces into protected "bastions" near Soviet
territory to **counter the U.S. ASW strategy**.]{.underline} [[The
United States did]{.mark} [not give]{.mark} up, [and]{.mark}
[worked]{.mark} until the end of the Cold War (and beyond) [to **regain
undersea superiority.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Deterrence against China submarines is successful---ASW forces prove

**Carnegie Endowment, 18** (Carnegie endowment for International peace,
10-24-18, "US Anti-submarine Warfare and Its Impact,"
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/10/24/u.s.-anti-submarine-warfare-and-its-impact-pub-77495>)

[[Geography lend]{.mark}s various [advantages to]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [and]{.mark} its [allies'
efforts]{.mark} [to block]{.mark} Chinese [**SSBNs**]{.mark} from
patrolling in the Pacific Ocean]{.underline}. [The [biggest
roadblock]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the existence of major chokepoints
separating [China's coastal waters]{.mark} from the Pacific
Ocean.]{.underline} Along the First Island Chain, there are only a
limited number of waterways---including the Miyako Strait and the Bashi
Channel (in the Luzon Strait near the Philippines)---through which
Chinese SSBNs can transit[. [All]{.mark} of these [waterways]{.mark}
[are adjacent]{.mark} [to land]{.mark} features possessed or [controlled
by U.S. allies]{.mark}, [so]{.mark} the [passages are under]{.mark}
close [**surveillance** by]{.mark} U.S. or U.S.-friendly **[ASW
forces.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In fact, some [[Japanese defense]{.mark} [officials used to
boast]{.mark} that [**Chinese submarine**s]{.mark} [would not be]{.mark}
[able to slip]{.mark} [into the Pacific]{.mark} through the Ryukyus, a
chain of islands scattered along the north and south of Taiwan, or
through the Bashi Channel without being detected by U.S. and Japanese
ASW systems]{.underline}.1 Indeed, there have been cases when foreign
countries have reportedly detected Chinese SSNs in transit. In 2004, for
example, a Chinese 091-class nuclear attack submarine was reportedly
detected by Japanese, Taiwanese, and U.S. ASW platforms as the submarine
sailed from the Western Pacific back to China, passing through Japanese
waters.2 Similarly, in January 2018, a Chinese 093-class SSN---which is
believed to be considerably quieter than the 091-class SSN, and which
may have a noise level similar to that of the 094-class SSBN---was
reportedly detected by Japan while it was submerged near the
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands.3 Notably, Chinese SSBNs face greater
geographical constraints today than Soviet SSBNs did during the Cold
War. The barrier formed by Greenland, Iceland, and the UK that Soviet
SSBNs needed to pass through to reach the North Atlantic Ocean is much
wider than the waterways in the First Island Chain.

[To compound the geographical advantages that China's rivals enjoy, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its [allies have]{.mark}
significantly [augmented]{.mark} their [sound surveillance]{.mark}
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline} in and around the Pacific in recent
decades, in the face of increasing Chinese submarine activity.4 [The
United States even has reportedly extended its underwater hydrophone
systems to the south of the Philippines to connect with islands
belonging to Indonesia and, from there, north to India's Andaman
Islands.5 [This a]{.mark}ll-encompassing, [seamless
network]{.mark}---known as the U.S. Navy's Fish Hook Undersea Defense
Line---[has the potential]{.mark} [to]{.mark} seriously [undermine
Chinese SSBNs']{.mark}]{.underline} ability to leave China's coastal
waters and sail into the Pacific or Indian Oceans.

Beyond Chinese concerns about detection, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could undermine]{.mark} the efficacy of [China's
sea-based]{.mark} [nuclear deterrent]{.mark} [by interfering]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} its command, control, and communications ([C3)
system]{.mark}. Foreign analysts have long raised doubts about China's
ability to maintain reliable communication channels with SSBNs operating
in distant oceans]{.underline}.6 Conducting long distance communications
with a submerged SSBN is challenging, though Beijing has been seeking to
improve in this area. Open-source research indicates that China is now
capable of communicating with submarines at super low frequencies (SLF)
of 30--300 hertz.7 In 2009, China reportedly completed construction on
its first military SLF transmission station and conducted several tests.
One year later, a Chinese nuclear submarine successfully received
messages from the SLF transmission station, as China became the third
country in the world to establish a comparable submarine communications
system.

### 2NC -- Tech

#### Growing transparency over military operations has increased counterforce effectiveness -- especially over remote-sensing

[[Five trends]{.mark} are [ushering in an age]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**unprecedented [transparency]{.mark}**. First [sensor platforms have
become]{.mark} more [diverse.]{.mark} The mainstays of Cold War tech-
nical intelligence---satellites, submarines, and piloted
aircraft---continue to play a vital role, and they are being
supplemented by new platforms. For example, [**remotely piloted
aircraft** and underwater drones]{.mark} now [gather in-
tel]{.mark}ligence [during peacetime]{.mark} and war]{.underline}.
Autonomous [sensors, hidden on the ground or tethered to the seabed,
**monitor adversary facilities**, forces, and operations. Additionally,
the past two decades have witnessed the development of a new "virtual"
sensing platform: cyberspying. [Second, sensors]{.mark} [are
collecting]{.mark} a widening [array of signals]{.mark} f[or]{.mark}
analysis using a [growing list of]{.mark}
[techniques]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Early Cold War strategic
intelligence relied heavily on photoreconnaissance, underwater
acoustics, and the col- lection of adversary communications, all of
which remain important. Now, [modern sensors gather data from across the
entire **electromagnetic spec- trum;** [they employ seismic]{.mark} and
acoustic [sensors i]{.mark}n tandem; [and]{.mark} they [emit
radar]{.mark} at various frequencies depending on their purpose---for
example, to maximize resolution or to penetrate foliage]{.underline}.
[[**Modern remote sensing** exploits]{.mark} an [increasing number
of]{.mark} **[analytic techniques]{.mark}**, including spectroscopy to
identify the vapors leaking from faraway facilities, interferometry
[to]{.mark} [discover]{.mark} underground
[structures]{.mark}]{.underline}, and signals-processing techniques
(such as those underpinning synthetic aperture radars) that allow radars
to perform better than their antenna size would seem to permit.
[[Third]{.mark}, [remote-sensing platforms]{.mark} increasingly [provide
persistent observation]{.mark}. At the beginning of the Cold War,
**strategic intelligence** was hobbled by sensors that collected
snapshots rather than streams of data.]{.underline} Spy planes sprinted
past targets, and satellites passed overhead and then disappeared over
the horizon. [Over time those sensors were supplemented with plat- forms
that remained in place and soaked up data, such as signals-intelligence
**antennas, undersea hydrophones, and geostationary
satellites**]{.underline}. The trend toward persistence is continuing.
Today, remotely piloted vehicles can loiter near enemy targets and
autonomous sensors can monitor critical road junctures for months or
years. Persistent observation is essential if the goal is not merely to
count enemy weapons but also to track their movement. The
[[fourth]{.mark} [factor in]{.mark} the ongoing [remote sensing]{.mark}
[revolution is]{.mark} the **[steady improvement]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
sensor [resolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} In every field that employs
remote-sensing technology, including medicine, geology, and astronomy,
[**[improved sensors and]{.mark} advanced data [processing]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} [permitting]{.mark} more [accurate measures]{.mark} and
fainter signals to be discerned from background noise]{.underline}. The
leap in satellite image resolution is but one example. The first U.S.
reconnaissance satellite (Corona) could detect objects as small as 25
feet wide; today, commercial sat- ellites (e.g., DigitalGlobe's
WorldView-3 and WorldView-4) can collect im- ages with 1-foot resolution
and U.S. spy satellites are reportedly capable of resolutions of less
than 4 inches. [[Advances in resolution]{.mark} are not merely
**transforming optical remote-sensing** systems; they are extending what
can be seen by infrared sensors, advanced radars, interferometers and
spectro- graphs, and many other sensors. [The fifth]{.mark} key trend
[is the]{.mark} huge **[increase in data transmission speed]{.mark}**.
During the first decades of the Cold War, it took days or longer to
transmit information from sensors to analysts]{.underline}. At least a
full day passed before the photographs snapped by U-2 aircraft were
developed and analyzed. Early satellites were slower: the satellite had
to finish its roll of film and then eject the canister, which would be
caught midair and flown to a facility for development and analysis; all
told, it might take weeks before images collected at the begin- ning of
a satellite mission arrived at an analyst's desk. [Today, by contrast,
intelligence gathered by aircraft, satellites, and drones can be
transmitted in nearly real time. The [**data can be transmitted** to
intelligence analysts]{.mark}, **to [politi- cal leaders]{.mark},**
[and]{.mark} in some cases directly to [military commanders]{.mark}
conducting operations.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- ! -- AI

#### China is [racing]{.underline} toward developing [general AI.]{.underline}

Maximilian **Schreiner 22**, A studied philosopher who writes about
artificial intelligence and virtual reality, 3-27-2022, \"Artificial
Intelligence: China researches \"brain-scale\" AI,\"
<https://mixed-news.com/en/artificial-intelligence-china-researches-brain-scale-ai/>,
cy

In **[China]{.underline}**, the state and companies are researching AI
models with trillions of parameters. They [want to prove that they can
develop "brain-scale" AI.]{.underline}

[**In the race** to build **ever-larger AI models**, China is showing
that cooperation between the state, universities and the private sector
holds the potential for gigantic AI models.]{.underline} The researchers
are talking about ["brain-scale" AI:]{.underline} according to their
definition, [these are AI models with parameters beyond the 100-trillion
mark.]{.underline}

[Currently, **the largest AI models** include]{.underline} Nvidia
Megatron NGL with 530 billion parameters, Google's Switch Transformer
with 1.6 trillion and WuDao 2.0 with [**1.75 trillion**
parameters.]{.underline}

Such models and others are often developed exclusively by companies in
the West. There are individual exceptions, such as Open GPT-X, a
language model being developed as part of the Gaia-X initiative, or the
BigScience project of the AI start-up HuggingFace, which is training a
language model on a French supercomputer. The Eleuther AI research
collective is also developing open-source models such as GPT-NeoX.

Small record on the way to the big 100 trillion model

In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group,
Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present
BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using
the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

Like OpenAI's GPT-3, it relies on Transformer models, but in AI training
it forms individual expert networks that take on specific queries while
conserving the resources of the rest of the network. The huge MoE models
only ever activate the part of the network that is currently needed,
rather than the entire network, as many other AI architectures do.

In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with
their framework, outperforming Google's Switch Transformer. [They also
demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a
**full 174 trillion parameters.**]{.underline}

The researchers conducted their experiments on the Chinese supercomputer
"New Generation Sunway" and also showed which hurdles supercomputer
technology still has to overcome for the planned gigantic models.

[Brain-sized AI models could bring major advances]{.underline}

The team expects that giant multimodal AI models could have far-reaching
implications for numerous AI applications. Multimodal means that an AI
is trained with different related data, such as photos, texts, and
videos.

The researchers cite image and video annotation, image and video
generation, multimodal search, answering visual questions, visual
reasoning, object referencing, multimodal dialog systems, and multimodal
translation as application scenarios. Moreover, the experience gained in
these fields [could be transferred to other areas, such as **AI** in
**biology** or **chemistry.**]{.underline}

one future threat that]{.underline} is **[less well known]{.underline}**
-- and while it doesn't involve the extinction of our species, [it could
be **just as bad**.]{.underline}

It's called the "world in chains" scenario, where, like the preceding
thought experiment, [a global totalitarian government uses a novel
technology to lock a majority of the world into **perpetual
suffering**]{.underline}. If it sounds grim, you'd be right. But is it
likely? Researchers and philosophers are beginning to ponder how it
might come about -- and, more importantly, what we can do to avoid it.

Existential risks (**[x-risks]{.underline}**) [are disastrous because
they lock humanity into a **single fate**, like the permanent collapse
of civilisation or the extinction of our species.]{.underline} These
catastrophes can have natural causes, like an asteroid impact or a
supervolcano, or be human-made from sources like nuclear war or climate
change. Allowing one to happen would be "an abject end to the human
story\" and would let down the hundreds of generations that came before
us, says Haydn Belfield, academic project manager at the Centre for the
Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

Toby Ord, a senior research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute
(FHI) at Oxford University, believes that the odds of an existential
catastrophe happening this century from natural causes are less than one
in 2,000, because humans have survived for 2,000 centuries without one.
However, when he adds the probability of human-made disasters, Ord
believes the chances increase to a startling one in six. He refers to
this century as "the precipice" because the risk of losing our future
has never been so high.

Researchers at the Center on Long-Term Risk, a non-profit research
institute in London, have expanded upon x-risks with the
even-more-chilling prospect of suffering risks. These
"**[s-risks]{.underline}**" [are defined as "suffering on an
**astronomical scale**, vastly exceeding all suffering that has existed
on Earth so far]{.underline}." In these scenarios, [life
**continues**]{.underline} for billions of people, [but the quality is
**so low** and the **outlook so bleak**]{.underline} that [dying out
would be **preferable**.]{.underline} In short: [a future with
**negative value**]{.underline} [is worse than one **with no value at
all**]{.underline}.

This is where the "world in chains" scenario comes in. If [a
**malevolent group**]{.underline} or government suddenly
[gained]{.underline} **[world-dominating power through
technology]{.underline}**, and there was nothing to stand in its way,
[it could lead to an extended period of **abject suffering and
subjugation**]{.underline}. A 2017 report on existential risks from the
Global Priorities Project, in conjunction with FHI and the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Finland, warned that ["a long future under
a]{.underline} particularly brutal [global totalitarian state could
**arguably be worse than complete extinction**]{.underline}".

Singleton hypothesis

Though global totalitarianism is still a niche topic of study,
researchers in the field of existential risk are increasingly turning
their attention to [its most likely cause: **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline}.

In his "singleton hypothesis", Nick Bostrom, director at Oxford's FHI,
has explained how [a global government]{.underline} [could form with
AI]{.underline} or other powerful technologies -- [and why it might be
**impossible to overthrow**]{.underline}. He writes that [a world with
"a single decision-making agency at the highest level" could occur if
that agency "obtains a decisive lead through a **technological
breakthrough**]{.underline} in artificial intelligence or molecular
nanotechnology". Once in charge, [it would control advances in
technology that prevent **internal challenges**, like
**surveillance**]{.underline} or autonomous weapons, [and]{.underline},
with this monopoly, [remain **perpetually stable**]{.underline}.

If the singleton is totalitarian, [life would be **bleak**]{.underline}.
Even in the countries with the strictest regimes, news leaks in and out
from other countries and people can escape. [A global totalitarian rule
would eliminate even these small seeds of hope. To be worse than
extinction, "that would mean we feel **absolutely no freedom**, **no
privacy**, **no hope of escaping**, **no agency to control our lives at
all**]{.underline}\", says Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future of Life
Institute in Massachusetts, which focuses on existential risk research.

"[In totalitarian regimes of the past]{.underline}, \[[there
was]{.underline}\] so much [paranoia and psychological suffering because
you just have no idea if you\'re going to get **killed**]{.underline}
for saying the wrong thing," he continues. "[And now imagine that
**there\'s not even a question**]{.underline}, every single thing you
say is being reported and being analysed."

"We may not yet have the technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent
interview, "but [it looks like the kinds of technologies we're
developing make that **easier and easier**]{.underline}. And it seems
plausible that [this may become possible at some time in the next **100
years**]{.underline}."

AI and authoritarianism

Though life under a global totalitarian government is still an unlikely
and far-future scenario, [AI is **already enabling
authoritarianism**]{.underline} in some countries and strengthening
[infrastructure that could be **seized by an opportunistic despot in
others**]{.underline}.

"We\'ve seen sort of a reckoning with the shift from very utopian
[visions of]{.underline} what [tech]{.underline}nology might bring to
much more sobering realities that [are]{.underline}, in some respects,
**[already quite dystopian]{.underline}**," says Elsa Kania, an adjunct
senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, a bipartisan
non-profit that develops national security and defence policies.

In the past, surveillance required hundreds of thousands of people --
one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an informant -- but now it
can be done by technology. In the United States, the National Security
Agency (NSA) collected hundreds of millions of American call and text
records before they stopped domestic surveillance in 2019, and there are
an estimated four to six million CCTV cameras across the United Kingdom.
Eighteen of the 20 most surveilled cities in the world are in China, but
London is the third. The difference between them lies less in the tech
that the countries employ and more in how they use it.

What if the definition of what is illegal in the US and the UK expanded
to include criticising the government or practising certain religions?
The infrastructure is already in place to enforce it, and AI -- which
the NSA has already begun experimenting with -- would enable agencies to
search through our data faster than ever before.

In addition to enhancing surveillance, [AI also underpins the growth of
**online misinformation**]{.underline}, which is another [tool of the
**authoritarian**]{.underline}. AI-powered **[deep fakes]{.underline}**,
which [can spread **fabricated political messages**]{.underline}, [and
algorithmic micro-targeting on social media are making propaganda more
**persuasive**. This undermines our **epistemic security**]{.underline}
-- the ability to determine what is true and act on it -- [that
democracies depend on]{.underline}.

"Over the last few years, we\'ve seen the rise of filter bubbles and
people getting shunted by various algorithms into believing various
conspiracy theories, or even if they're not conspiracy theories, into
believing only parts of the truth," says Belfield. "[You can imagine
things getting **much worse**]{.underline}, especially [with deep fakes
and things like that, until it\'s increasingly harder for us
to]{.underline}, as a society, [decide these are the facts of the
matter]{.underline}, this is what we have to do about it, and then take
collective action."

GENEVA (AP) --- A [U.S. diplomat]{.underline} focusing on disarmament

[developing naval and aerial **autonomous nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
systems, warning [any]{.underline} such [development]{.underline} [could
disrupt **strategic stability**.]{.underline}

Ambassador Robert Wood, the U.S. envoy to the Conference on Disarmament
in Geneva, said China hasn't developed or been able to weaponize the
technology yet. But his comments suggested that China is interested in
such so-called "exotic nukes" like nuclear-powered underwater drones and
nuclear-powered cruise missiles being developed by Russia.

"This is something they are looking at," Wood said. "If they were to
develop \... these kinds of weapons and aerial systems, this has the
potential to change the strategic stability environment in a dynamic
way."

The United States doesn't have either type of system.

"[This is not where China was **10 years ago,"**]{.underline} Wood
added, [noting the "**upward trajectory**]{.underline}" that [China has
been on]{.underline} in [the]{.underline} quantity and [quality of its
**weapons systems**]{.underline}. "They're pursuing weapons similar to
some of the nuclear-powered delivery systems that the Russians have been
pursuing."

Russia has said its development of such weaponry is aimed at countering
the United States' defenses against ballistic missiles. Moscow has
expressed concern that such [defenses could eventually undermine the
**viability** of its]{.underline} [**strategic offensive** nuclear
forces]{.underline}, although Washington insists that its defensive
system is designed to protect the U.S. homeland from North Korean
missiles, not Russia's or China's.

[With the rise of **a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, **[supercomputing]{.underline}**, [and
**data analytics**, the world today is at a crucial turning
point]{.underline} in the national security and the conduct of war.
Sometimes [known as the **AI triad,**]{.underline} these characteristics
and other weapons systems, such as hypersonics, [are accelerating both
the speed with which warfare is waged]{.underline}, and the speed with
which warfare can escalate. [Called "**hyperwar**]{.underline}" by Amir
Husain and one of us (John R. Allen), this new form of warfare will
feature levels of autonomy, including the potential for lethal
autonomous weapons without humans being in the loop on decision-making.

How artificial intelligence is transforming the world

Assessing ethical AI principles in defense

It will affect both the nature and character of war and usher in new
risks for humanity. As noted in our recent AI book "Turning Point,"
[this **emerging reality** could feature]{.underline} swarms of drones
that may overwhelm aircraft carriers, cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure, **[AI-guided nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, and
hypersonic missiles [that **automatically launch** when satellite
sensors detect **ominous actions** by adversaries]{.underline}. It may
seem to be a dystopian future, but some of these capabilities are with
us now. And to be clear, both of us, and more broadly the world's
liberal democracies, are struggling with the moral and ethical
implications of fully autonomous, lethal weapon systems.

In this high-risk era, it is now time to negotiate global agreements
governing the conduct of war during the early adoption and adaptation of
AI and emerging technologies to the waging of war and to specific
systems and weapons. It will be much easier to do this before AI
capabilities are fully fielded and embedded in military planning.
Similar to earlier treaties on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons
in the post-war period, these agreements should focus on several key
principles:

Incorporate ethical principles such as human rights, accountability, and
civilian protection in AI-based military decisions. Policymakers should
ensure there is no race to the bottom that allows technology to dictate
military applications as opposed to basic human values.

Keep humans in the loop with autonomous weapons systems. It is vital
that people make the ultimate decisions on missile launches, drone
attacks, and large-scale military actions. Good judgment and wisdom
cannot be automated and AI cannot incorporate necessary ethical
principles into its assessments.

Adopt a norm of not having [AI algorithms within **nuclear** operational
**command and control** system]{.underline}s. The [risk of **global
destruction** is high with **AI-based launch** on warning
systems]{.underline}. Since we do not know, and may never know, exactly
how [AI learns from **training data**, it is important not to deploy
systems that could create an **existential threat** to
humanity.]{.underline}

#### AI risks [accidental launches]{.underline} AND [hair-trigger]{.underline} readiness posture -- [extinction]{.underline}.

Yonah **Bob 19**, Jerusalem Post\'s intelligence, terrorism and legal
analyst and Literary Editor, 12/25/2019, \"Scientists warn AI control of
nukes could lead to 'Terminator-style' war,\"

The [world may be inching **closer** to an era where a
**Terminator-style** apocalyptic nuclear war]{.underline} [could be
possible due to yielding control over nuclear weapons to **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence (AI),]{.underline} according to publications by nuclear
scientists and defense experts.

While numerous AI experts have told the Jerusalem Post over the years
that people worried about AI turning on humanity as in the famous
"Terminator" movies simply misunderstand the technology, the [likelihood
of AI making a **catastrophic mistake** with nuclear weapons is no
**fairytale**.]{.underline}

A recent article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a top group
of nuclear scientists, as well as other recent publications by defense
experts have said that Russia may already be integrating AI into a new
nuclear torpedo it is developing known as the Poseidon, to make it
autonomous.

According to the Atomic Scientists report, the US and China are also
considering injecting AI deeper into their nuclear weapons' programs as
they modernize and overhaul their nuclear inventory.

There have been no express reports about Israel integrating AI into,
what according to foreign reports, is an apparatus of between 80-200
nuclear weapons. But there have been reports of the IDF integrating AI
into conventional weapons, such as its spice bomb carried by F-16s.

Part of the concern in the report was that integrating AI into nuclear
weapons' systems could become culturally inevitable once
non-conventional weapons become more dominated by AI.

The [**nuclear holocaust** risks]{.underline} that scientists and
experts are writing about [are not a **hostile takeover** by AI, but by
AI getting hacked, slipping out of control by a **technical
error**]{.underline} or badly misjudging a situation.

Such [risks could be magnified by unmanned vehicles carrying nuclear
weapons where there is no one on board]{.underline} [and responsible for
making the]{.underline} final [decision to deploy a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}.

As a secondary but still serious risk, **[AI integration]{.underline}**
into early warning systems [could overwhelm **human decision-makers**
who could be faster on the **nuclear trigger finger**]{.underline} to
yield to the technology [despite]{.underline} any human judgment
[doubts]{.underline} they might have.

Some studies have shown that [AI]{.underline} and automated evidence in
general [can reinforce **bubble-style thinking**]{.underline} and make
it more difficult for analysts to entertain alternate narratives about
what might be occurring in murky and hi-stress situations.

An example that the article gives of human judgment's importance was a
1983 incident when a Soviet officer named Stanislav Petrov disregarded
automated audible and visual warnings that US nuclear missiles were
inbound.

The systems were wrong and had Petrov trusted technology over his own
instincts, the world might have gone to nuclear war over a technological
malfunction.

The article also points out potential valuable aspects of AI in the
nuclear weapons arena, such as gathering more accurate and comprehensive
data so that decision-makers are guessing in the dark less often.

In addition, AI can get such key information to decision-makers much
faster whereas in the past key information might be stuck in the
collection process without getting to leaders in time before they had to
make a decision.

Moreover, the article noted that AI has been integrated into aspects of
countries' nuclear programs for some time.

Even in earlier decades of the Cold War, both the US and Russia had
certain capabilities programmed into some nuclear weapons to be able to
quickly switch to targeting each other, as opposed to landing harmlessly
at sea, should certain scenarios occur.

Overall, the greatest concern about AI in nuclear weapons is with the
weaker side in a potential standoff.

A country like [China]{.underline}, with much more limited nuclear or
conventional weapons capabilities, [might seek to integrate AI into its
nuclear]{.underline} weapons [program with the hope of **accelerating
deployment speed** so that the US would be unable to knock it out of a
war with a **preemptive "first strike**."]{.underline}

### 1NC -- ! -- Biotech

#### China is developing [groundbreaking biotechnology]{.underline}, results in the most [dangerous versions]{.underline} of [CRISPR]{.underline}, [nanotech]{.underline}, [super soldiers]{.underline}, and [cognitive warfare]{.underline}.

for NBC News, based in Washington, "China has done human testing to
create biologically enhanced super soldiers, says top U.S. official",

WASHINGTON --- [U.S. intelligence shows that China has conducted
\"**human testing**\" on members of the **P**]{.underline}eople\'s
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy [in hope of
developing **soldiers** with \"**biologically enhanced**
capabilities]{.underline},\" the top U.S. intelligence official said
Friday.

John [Ratcliffe, the director of **national intelligence**]{.underline},
included the explosive claim in a long Wall Street Journal op-ed in
which he [made the case that China poses the pre-eminent **national
security threat** to the U.S]{.underline}.

\"[There are **no ethical boundaries** to Beijing\'s pursuit of
power]{.underline},\" wrote Ratcliffe, a Republican former member of
Congress from Texas.

His office and the CIA did not immediately respond to requests to
elaborate on the notion that China sought to create \"super soldiers\"
of the sort depicted in Hollywood films like \"Captain America,\"
\"Bloodshot\" and \"Universal Soldier.\"

Last year, two [American scholars wrote a paper examining China\'s
ambitions to apply biotechnology to the **battlefield**]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} what they said were [signs that China was
interested in using gene-editing technology to enhance human --- and
perhaps **soldier** --- performance]{.underline}.

Specifically, the [scholars explored Chinese research using the
gene-editing tool **CRISPR**, short for \"clusters of regularly
interspaced short **palindromic repeats**]{.underline}.\" CRISPR has
been used to treat genetic diseases and modify plants, but [Western
scientists consider it unethical to seek to manipulate genes to boost
the performance of healthy people]{.underline}.

\"While the [potential leveraging of CRISPR to increase human
capabilities on the future battlefield remains only a
hypothetical]{.underline} possibility at the present, there are
indications that [Chinese military researchers are starting to **explore
its potential**]{.underline},\" wrote the scholars, Elsa Kania, an
expert on Chinese defense technology at the Center for a New American
Security, and Wilson VornDick, a consultant on China matters and former
Navy officer.

\"**[Chinese military scientists]{.underline}** and strategists have
consistently [emphasized]{.underline} that [biotechnology could become a
\'new strategic **commanding heights** of the future Revolution in
Military Affairs]{.underline},\'\" the scholars wrote, quoting a 2015
article in a military newspaper.

One prominent Chinese general, they noted, said in 2017 that \"[modern
biotechnology and its **integration** with information,
**nano(technology**), and the **cognitive**, etc. domains will have
revolutionary influences upon weapons and equipment, the **combat
spaces**, the **forms of warfare**, and **military
theories**]{.underline}.\"

VornDick said in a phone interview that he is less concerned about the
battlefield advantage such research might provide than he is about the
consequences of tampering with human genes.

\"When we start playing around with genetic organisms, [there could be
**unforeseen consequences**]{.underline},\" he said.

Representatives of the Chinese government did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.

The overall message of Ratcliffe\'s opinion piece is that [China is a
dangerous adversary that **threatens** American economic and **national
security**]{.underline}.

\"The **[P]{.underline}**eople\'s **[R]{.underline}**epublic of
**[C]{.underline}**hina [poses the greatest threat to America today, and
the **greatest threat** to democracy and freedom world-wide since
**World War II**]{.underline},\" he wrote. \"The intelligence is clear:
Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet
economically, militarily and technologically.\"

In an interview with Fox News, Ratcliffe urged President-elect Joe Biden
to \"be honest\" about China.

As NBC News has reported, Biden and his foreign policy advisers agree
that China poses a major threat, but they say they believe the Trump
administration offered more bluster than substance in response.

The [conventional wisdom on biotechnology has held that coming decades
will see Western nations increasingly vulnerable to ever-more
sophisticated biological weapons attacks]{.underline} by non-state
actors and rogue states. [As recombinant genetic technology
proliferates, a greater number of actors will possess genetic
engineering]{.underline} capabilities [that will enhance the lethality
and durability of their biological weapons. Proponents]{.underline} of
this perspective [note that the overwhelming technological
advantage]{.underline} in conventional forces [enjoyed by the United
States creates the incentive for competitors to develop effective
asymmetric responses, and that]{.underline} the [affordability,
accessibility, and relatively easy preparatio]{.underline}n of
biological weapons [make them a likely means of doing so]{.underline}.
In [this view, the superior conventional capabilities]{.underline} of
the US military [not only fail to deter the proliferation of biological
weapons, but encourage their development]{.underline}. Western states
will face an increasing number of biologically armed opponents, and will
remain on the defensive. [The priority for military biotech research is
therefore the **development of protective equipment and vaccines**,
antibiotics and antivirals]{.underline} (Department of Defense 1998).
However, [this scenario requires the presumption that military
applications of biotech]{.underline}nology [will simply be a secular
progression from the bacteriological warfare that has existed
throughout]{.underline} history. Even when analysts have factored in the
vast possibilities of genetic engineering, it has usually only been to
the extent that they can breed deadlier pathogens, and that the growing
availability of technology means that it may be used by a broader
spectrum of actors. [Conventional wisdom therefore **predicts an
unstable future** for the international system, a **Hobbesian world in
which the weakest** have power to **kill the strongest**. **Rather**
than rogue states and non-state terrorists, **it is the most
powerful**]{.underline} and resource-laden actors [in the international
system **that will enjoy the advantages of "biological
warfare**"]{.underline} in the twenty-first century [as they
**continuously integrate** emergent **biotech**nologies **into their
military and national defense**]{.underline} infrastructures and extend
their dominance. This [process will closely resemble the Revolution in
Military Affairs]{.underline} (RMA) that occurred during the last 30
years of the twentieth century as the United States adapted its forces
to exploit advances in new information technologies. The RMA, first
described by the Soviet military intelligence in the 1970s and then
witnessed by the world during the unexpectedly uneven 1991 Gulf War,
occurred because the United States employed its competitive advantage in
integrated computer systems. [Rather than a single transformative
device, like the atomic bomb, the steady accretion of advanced
technologies augmenting existing equipment came to inform doctrine and
strategies]{.underline}. The term [asymmetric warfare is meant to
describe efforts by weaker participants in military confrontations to
frustrate]{.underline} the advantages of the [stronger power by guerilla
tactics]{.underline} or other unconventional methods not envisioned in
force planning (Mack 1975[). However, high technology also **offers
asymmetric advantages to the best-equipped actors**]{.underline}, and
American military planners sought to use the advances of the RMA to
field forces that no state competitor could match. Their goals included
"dominant maneuver" capability on the battlefield in bringing dispersed
resources to bear against targets, "precision engagement" capability
delivered by smart weapons, and "full dimension force protection"
against all anticipated threats (Rizwan 2000). [The ultimate expression
of this vision would be a fighter comparable to a]{.underline} [**"Jedi
knight"** from the Star Wars films: a **super-empowered solider**,
dressed in a **protective stealth cloak** and commanding an **armed
companion drone**, able to perform solo missions and to transmit data
back to headquarters]{.underline} (Hundley and Gritton 1994).
Coincidentally or not, this is precisely how Darth Maul was depicted in
1999's The Phantom Menace. [Military planners]{.underline} likewise
[foresee similar advantages conferred by developments
across]{.underline} the various [biotech fields.]{.underline} In coming
decades, [biotechnology is forecast to bring advances such as "rugged
computers"]{.underline} made from biological components [that will
provide situational awareness to individual soldiers]{.underline} on the
battlefield, camouflaged materials and lightweight armor incorporating
the properties of living organisms, and ingested biological markers to
distinguish friendlies, which would be of particular use in
counterinsurgency (Purdue University 2001). From the perspective of
those involved in force planning, [the anticipated **future is not one
of vulnerability but unassailability.**]{.underline} Defense R&D While
some military (or potentially military) applications of biotechnology
are indeed products of the private sector, it is no state secret that
militaries actively sponsor their own biotech research and development
programs. The United States Department of Defense in particular is open
about the large number of such projects that it oversees. And while most
of these are described as intended for troop protection, many are
clearly intended to enhance combat operations. As with pathogen
stockpiles maintained ostensibly for defensive research, it is only the
intent of the wielder that determines whether or not they are offensive.
And as the 2001 anthrax case illustrates, even projects officially
intended for defensive purposes may be misapplied. Much of the biotech
research is conducted under the auspices of the Pentagon's DARPA rather
than legacy programs remaining from the era of bacteriological weapons
stockpiles. Established in 1958 as a response to the launch of the first
Sputnik satellite by the Soviet Union the year before, DARPA was
intended to promote "high-risk -- high-payoff" R&D in areas beyond the
immediate envisioned needs of military planners. The Agency's singular
most influential project has undoubtedly been a communications system
that came to be known as DARPANET before penetrating -- and transforming
-- the commercial sector as the internet (Van Atta 2008, pp. 20, 23,
27). While a reported 90% of its projects fail to come to fruition,
high-profile DARPA research that has had a significant impact on United
States military capability includes Saturn rockets, ground radar,
stealth fighters, Predator missiles, and drones. The agency's budget of
\$3 billion is small compared to intelligence agencies, but it supports
an "open culture" promoting "radical innovation" praised by participant
scientists, most of whom are university researchers (Moreno 2006, pp.
12--13, Basken 2013). In 2014, DARPA announced the creation of a new
Biological Technologies Division, built from existing research units and
new programs, intended to ensure that biotechnology is not merely an
aspect of various research programs, but that "biology takes its place
among the core sciences that represent the future of defense
technology." The new division's primary goals include to "restore and
maintain warfighter abilities," and "to enhance global-scale stability"
(DARPA 2014). Similarly, the Pentagon Office of Net Assessment (ONA),
which envisions potential future strategic environments and challenges,
has also promoted biotech R&D as a defense priority. In 2002, the ONA
recommended revising Federal regulations to allow experimental
biotechnologies to be brought to the battlefield more readily. It also
called for facilitating a greater partnership with private sector
researchers by restricting anti-trust laws to permit quicker product
development (Armstrong and Warner 2003). In biotech in particular, the
military has an advantage over the private sector because it does not
have to go through the lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and
approval process for medical devices and treatments (Wheelis, in Pearson
et al. 2007, p. 4). The future is now: from lab to battlefield Whether
**[in collaboration with the private sector]{.underline}** or directly
from their own research facilities, [leading state military programs are
implementing biotech innovations that have already had significant
impacts beyond]{.underline} the [realistic aspirations of non-state
actors]{.underline}. The lives of [**thousands** of Coalition troops
**have been saved by biotech**]{.underline}nologies deployed **[in Iraq
and Afghanistan]{.underline}**, and other [projects being implemented
will enable soldiers to fight more effectively under more adverse
conditions]{.underline} than previously possible. In short, [rather than
being curtailed by asymmetric defenses, the **power projection
capabilities** of the strongest actors in the international system
**will increase markedly** during the twenty-first century]{.underline}.
Troop health and survivability Despite the mechanization and increased
destructive power of warfare in the midnineteenth century, it was not
until World War II that wartime combat deaths exceeded those off the
battlefield. This shift, due to advances in combat medicine, permitted
American and British forces to conduct forward operations with reduced
fatalities. Advances in biotechnology are responsible for the
continuation of this trend into more current conflicts with similar
results (Frank 2007). When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, many
of its soldiers and Marines were treated with \$90 HemCon bandages. The
military ordered 26,000 of these dressings, made from a shrimp shell
extract called chitosan, which stopped arterial bleeding within a minute
of application to wounds. Another bandage, developed by the American Red
Cross but with limited use because of its \$1000 price tag, was made of
clotting proteins extracted from human blood. By contrast, a powdered
coagulant manufactured by Z-Medica called QuikClot that could be poured
directly onto wounds was issued in first-aid kits, initially to Marines
and then across service branches. QuikClot is a granular substance that
can be poured directly onto a wound, almost instantly forming a clot
that stops bleeding. A hemostatic agent in QuikClot draws water
molecules out of blood and promotes accelerated clotting (Allen 2003).
By 2010, both the United States Army and Marines had switched to
providing QuikClot Combat Gauze in first aid kits instead (Cavallaro
2010). Other options are available as well: DARPA has tasked partner
company Arsenal Medical with developing its hemostatic foam into a
product that could be used to stop internal bleeding even without direct
access to the combat wound (DARPA, "Wound Stasis System" 2013). The use
of biotechnologically advanced coagulants to treat severe combat
injuries had a substantial effect on the first wars of the twenty-first
century: "The ratio of \[American\] combat-zone deaths to those wounded
has dropped from 24% in Vietnam to 13% in Iraq and Afghanistan. In other
words, the numbers of those killed as a percentage of overall casualties
is lower" (Knickerbocker 2006). By the time of the War on Terror, 55% of
battlefield deaths were due to excessive blood loss (Armstrong and
Warner 2003). But the development of rapid coagulants sharply reduced
the rate of combat deaths and may have sustained the American public's
tolerance for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. The potential
implication is that democracies may become more willing to engage in
future wars if the human costs of doing so are minimized. [Biotech is
being employed]{.underline} along these lines across a variety of
projects: "Technologies are under investigation to [fully restore
complex tissues]{.underline} (muscle, nerves, skin, etc.) [after
traumatic injury]{.underline}, and most dramatically, to develop
neural-controlled upper extremity prostheses that fully recapitulate the
motor and sensory functions of a natural limb" (DARPA, "Restorative
Biomedical Technologies" 2010). In the area of combat medicine, DARPA is
moving beyond coagulants. [Its projects involve blood "pharming" that
will produce engineered red blood cells]{.underline} (DARPA, "Blood
Pharm" 2010) [that can be preserved for delivery to the front lines to
enable transfusions for wounded troops]{.underline}, despite the
"austere conditions of forward deployment" (DARPA, "Long-Term Storage of
Blood Products" 2010). A related program would use hormone therapy to
extend the survivability of combatants losing critical amounts of blood
before fluids and transfusions can reach them: "[Achieving this goal
will allow increased time -- perhaps many hours or even days -- for
evacuation, triage, and initiation of supportive therapies]{.underline}"
(DARPA, "Surviving Blood Loss" 2010). To better treat other battlefield
wounds and reduce rehabilitation needs, "DARPA seeks to create a dynamic
putty-like material which, when packed in/around a compound bone
fracture, provides full load-bearing capabilities within days, creates
an osteoconductive bone-like internal structure, and degrades over time
to harmless resorbable by-products as normal bone regenerates" (DARPA,
"Fracture Putty" 2010). In vivo biomaterials, or compounds directly
incorporated by a living organism, would regenerate tissue and then be
fully absorbed (Armstrong and Warner 2003). An additional development
that could reduce infection and mortality among burn victims is a
"self-medicating" bandage. "Laced with nanoparticles, it detects harmful
bacteria in a wound and responds by secreting antibiotics" (De Lange
2010). A fully functional prosthetics program termed HAND: is developing
the fundamental research that will enable the use of neural activity to
... restore natural function through assistive devices. By directly
harnessing the ability of neural pathways to operate natural systems,
the HAND program seeks to provide means of restoring the lives of
injured warfighters. (DARPA, "Human-Assisted Neural Devices" 2010,
DARPA, "Reliable Neural Interface Technology" 2013). Clinical trials are
underway on accompanying neural-controlled prosthetic devices "almost
identical to a natural limb in terms of motor control and dexterity,
sensory feedback ... weight, and environmental resilience" (DARPA,
"Revolutionizing Prosthetics" 2010). And in 2013, DARPA-funded [research
enabled amputees to experience partial sensations of touch through
prosthetic limbs via neural interfaces]{.underline} (DARPA, "New Nerve
and Muscle Interfaces and Wounded Warrior Amputees" 2013). That such
research is being conducted by the Pentagon speaks to its perceived
strategic value. This line of research connects with the 2003 DARPA
Strategic Plan, coinciding with Director Goldblatt's speech, which also
called for creating "U.S. warfighters that only need use of the power of
their thoughts to do things at great distances." [Enabling the human
brain to directly control a peripheral device such as an artificial limb
also means that it could control robots on the battlefield that could
fight without risk to soldiers]{.underline} Moreno (2006, pp. 9, 39).
[Such]{.underline} avatars [would be the infantry equivalent of drone
aircraft and would profoundly change the nature of soldiering more than
UAVs are now doing with piloting]{.underline}. Other developments in
preventing or restoring injuries to troops are more overtly related to
battlefield performance. DARPA, in noting that "the negative impact that
stress has on the cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being of
warfighters is irrefutable," proposes that "Novel molecular biological
techniques, coupled with in-vivo measurement technologies, can allow for
management of the stress pathways and behavioral analysis in real time"
(DARPA, "Enabling Stress Resistance" 2010). Already, studies conducted
with trauma victims have demonstrated that Propranolol administered
shortly after the incident can mitigate the occurrence of PTSD (Dando,
in Pearson et al. 2007, pp. 133--134) 138--139). In the treatment of
injuries, human stem cells that can regenerate and replace otherwise
irreparably damaged cells could be used to potentially replace impaired
organs (Committee on Opportunities in Biotechnology for Future Army
Applications \[hereafter Committee\] 2001, p. 37). Another option is
using engineered viruses for delivery of genes. In 2005, researchers
were able to restore enough damaged cochlear hair cells in deafened
guinea pigs to recover 50--80% of their hearing levels. The therapy was
delivered by adenoviruses engineered both to render them harmless and to
produce a hair growth stimulant (Coghlan 2005). Some analysts expect
that advances in somatic genetics will render even therapeutic implants
unnecessary because "gene therapy agents could be transfected into cells
by bombarding a patch of skin with DNA-coated pellets from a gene gun"
(Committee 2001, p. 70). Another possibility is neural or cortical
implants such as prosthetic retinas, both to treat injuries and to offer
enhanced abilities. "As the risks and costs associated with neural
implants are reduced, they may be used to increase the visual and
hearing acuity of unimpaired individuals to levels well above average.
Soldiers possessing these extraordinary faculties would be well suited
to gathering intelligence and performing long range reconnaissance
missions" (Committee 2001, p. 38). Human enhancement [Efforts to field
augmented troops represent new approaches to the use of
biotech]{.underline}nology [in warfare]{.underline}, a [qualitative
shift away from traditional]{.underline} but uncertain bacteriological
[weapons to entirely new strategies for assuring battlefield
dominance]{.underline}. As proponents of this biotech approach envision
it, "futuristic, 'superhuman' capabilities of individual soldiers could
enable small units to operate for extended periods of time, carry the
fight to remote locales, and endure harsh extremes of climate"
(Committee 2001, p. 7). Moreno (2006, p. 114) argues that "[The first
state]{.underline} (or nonstate) [actor to build a better soldier will
have taken **an enormous leap in the arms race**]{.underline}."
[**Although seemingly fantastic**, **billions**]{.underline} of dollars
[**have already been spent** on several programs directed
toward]{.underline} fielding various types of "[Augments]{.underline}."
As with biotechnologies to increase survivability, introducing
mechanically or biologically augmented living soldiers offers multiple
benefits for states with the capacity to do so. It also raises a host of
political and ethical questions without clear answers. Certainly, there
would be tactical advantages for militaries whose personnel are able to
operate more effectively than their adversaries under difficult
conditions. And the boon of losing fewer servicemen to injury, and being
able to return those who are injured to the front lines more quickly, is
evident. But there are also broader potential national and international
political impacts. Democratic governments, which endeavor to avoid
costly or risky wars, (Gartner and Segura 1998, Reiter and Stamm 2002)
might be tempted to exert their power as their conventional force
advantages grow, and as the costs of providing for disabled veterans
diminish. Duncan (2012) writes about the ethics of augmentation when
everyone else is doing it. Parents might balk initially at the idea of
using technology to increase their children's cognitive performances,
but not if it means that they fall behind their augmented classmates.
Citizens might hesitate to vote for presidential candidates with neural
implants to enhance their reflexes and decision-making capabilities
during a crisis. But at some point, the question becomes "Would you vote
for a commander in chief who wasn't equipped with such a device?" This
hypothetical involving heads of state is about as far as most of the
ethicist approaches make toward questions of international security. But
it raises the question, and particularly [if rival **hegemons are
dispatching Augments** with advanced bioweapons]{.underline} and
biomedicines to the battlefield, [**what country** with the capability
to do so **could justify sending its soldiers** into harm's way
**without the best advantages** possible?]{.underline} The edited volume
Human Enhancement presents opposing arguments over biopolitics between
enthusiastic "transhumanists" and skeptical "bioconservatives" (Bostrom
and Savulescu in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 1). Yet, for all of the
discussion about practical issues and debates over social and ethical
considerations ranging over hundreds of pages, there is no consideration
that enhanced soldiers are at least as likely as enhanced athletes, and
national security is not cited among the social obligations that
transhumanists claim justify even heritable germline modifications.
Fukuyama (2004, pp. 42--43) noted that because "The new procedures and
technologies emerging from research laboratories and hospitals ... can
as easily be used to 'enhance' the species as to ease or ameliorate
illness.... The first victim of transhumanism might be equality," an
implication even more troubling at the international level when
considering what this might do to the already yawning resource gap
between the richest and poorest countries. George Annas contended that:
Ultimately it almost seems inevitable that genetic engineering would
move homo sapiens into two separable species: the standard-issue human
beings would be seen by the new, genetically enhanced neo-humans as
heathens who can properly be slaughtered and subjugated. It is this
genocidal potential that makes species-altering genetic engineering a
potential weapon of mass destruction and the unaccountable genetic
engineer a potential bioterrorist. (Juengst, in Savulescu and Bostrom
2009, p. 48) [Major powers with both conventional and asymmetric
biotechnological edges over rivals may similarly be open to the use of
force to **maintain their positions** if they are]{.underline} secure in
the knowledge that they are [well beyond the capabilities of opponents
to match them. The advent of nuclear weapons is credited with **reducing
the number of interstate wars**]{.underline}, with the effect of
[**entrenching the hegemony of the technologically advanced states**
that wield them]{.underline}. [RMA advances gave the United States a
lopsided advantage in its early post-Cold War interventions]{.underline}
(zero combat deaths during nearly three months of NATO missions during
the Kosovo War), and its initial easy success in toppling Saddam Hussein
from power in Iraq led, temporarily, to rapprochement efforts by "rogue"
regimes Iran and Libya to avoid the same fate. [While advanced equipment
is responsible for these successes, biotech now offers the opportunity
to enhance the performance of the combatants themselves]{.underline}.
\[DARPA\] is engaged in the [development of designer drugs]{.underline}
that [will increase cognitive functioning, including attention span and
alertness after periods of sleep deprivation]{.underline}. Another area
for future research is "[neural prostheses"]{.underline} that [will
enable commanders to monitor the vital signs of soldiers]{.underline} in
the field or even to permit the control of UAVs directly by pilots in
remote locations. (Huang and Kosal 2008) "In 2002, DARPA launched the
Augmented Cognition (or AugCog) initiative, a project dedicated to
developing a headband that monitors brain activity." With sensory input
controlled remotely, subjects doubled their recall and improved working
memory by 500% (The Economist 2010). Research on reducing the amount of
sleep that soldiers and pilots require to function effectively has
become a global enterprise, with countries including France, Canada,
Singapore, and Taiwan establishing military research units in this area.
In the language of these projects, fatigue and even sleep are described
as operational weaknesses preventing humans from taking full advantage
of their equipment, weaknesses that intervention can ameliorate. Some
major powers have already begun the attempt: during the Iraq War, the
British Ministry of Defense had purchased 24,000 tablets of one of the
most promising drugs, modafinil, and the United States and France both
began to routinely supply it to pilots. The use of stimulants by
militaries is so widely entrenched, with amphetamines in regular
prescribed use for decades (Saletan 2013), that Bostrom and Savulescu
(in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 2) question whether the use of
modafinil is qualitatively different from "a good cup of tea." But the
premise of reducing or eliminating the need for sleep as a component of
troop health is a recent development. Additionally, DARPA has provided
congressional testimony about its Continuous Assistance Program that
would "make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more
endurant, and better able to heal ... prevent fatigue and enable
soldiers to stay awake, alert, and effective for up to seven days
straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects
and without using any of the current generation of stimulants."
Potential approaches include the use of transcranial magnetic and
electrical stimulation to activate brain pathways and to enhance
learning (Moreno 2006, pp. 11, 118). Lab mice that have been altered as
embryos with extra copies of a memory-related gene "learn more quickly
and remember things longer than normal mice ... and the improvement was
passed on to offspring" (Sandel, in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 74).
In the meantime, the military relies on more conventional stimulants,
and the results might give pause to planners considering more radical
medical interventions. B-1 bomber pilots who operate 19-h flights
between the Persian Gulf and United States take Dexedrine, an
amphetamine known as speed or "go pills." One such pilot, who
subsequently went drinking with buddies before attacking them in a fit
of paranoid delusions in which he seemed to believe he was in the
television series 24, was acquitted by a court-martial after military
psychiatrists concluded that he suffered from a "substanceinduced
delirium" (Murphy 2012). American pilots who killed Canadian soldiers in
a 2003 friendly fire incident in Afghanistan had also been on Dexedrine
during 30-h missions (Moreno 2006, p. 115). Another DARPA neural program
with battlefield applications is Silent Talk, which would develop the
capability to communicate without speaking by recognizing the neural
signals for specific words. Linked devices would permit troops in the
field to recognize the signals for the "intended speech" of at least 100
words commonly used by troops in combat operations (Warwick 2009).
Beyond the advantages of silent communication and preventing hostile
forces from intercepting messages, such technology would effectively
produce electronic telepathy and have a tremendous commercial sector
potential for hands-free communication. While Augments would be able to
receive more situational information on the battlefield through neural
devices, processing it effectively is another matter. Technologies
developed through the AugCog and Enabling Stress Resistance projects
might alert commanders that individuals are suffering mental or physical
exhaustion. Another approach would be to "develop quantitative and
integrative neuroscience-based approaches for measuring, tracking, and
accelerating skill acquisition and learning while producing a twofold
increase in progression in an individual's progress through stages of
task learning." Reminiscent of the neural training uploads for
particular weapons systems and martial arts in the science fiction
Matrix films, results would be achieved through the "development of
neurally based techniques for maintenance of acquired skills \[and on\]
preferential brain network activation" (DARPA, "Accelerated Learning"
2010). Another program with the goal of "enhancing combat performance"
studies the influences of biological clocks on soldier health (DARPA,
"Biochronicity" 2013). Other biotechnologies would provide physical
enhancements to Augments. The field of biomimetics seeks to mimic useful
naturally occurring characteristics in living organisms. For example,
ants and spiders can lift loads dozens of times their own weight, and
horses can withstand freezing temperatures without thick hair.
"Understanding how horses and other animals overcome drastic changes in
their environment would be extremely useful. As a measure of the
importance of biomimesis, the Army has declared biomimetics one of its
Strategic Research Objectives (primary focus areas for basic research)"
(Committee 2001, pp.14--15). Already, researchers have developed
synthetic genes that repair damaged muscles and improve healthy ones in
mice (Sandel, in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 73). Another project at
least at the prototype stage for humans utilizes an electrically charged
under suit "focusing on the soft tissues that connect and interface with
the skeletal system." The goal of Warrior Web is "augmenting the work of
Soldiers' own muscles to significantly boost endurance, carrying
capacity, and warfighter effectiveness" (DARPA, "Warrior Web" 2013,
DARPA, "Warrior Web Prototype Takes Its First Steps" 2013). Power
projection Unless the R&D invested in these projects proves futile, the
United States D[epartment of Defense is indeed on its way to developing
**not just super-soldiers**, but essentially **comic book
super-heroes**]{.underline}. [Mentally and physically enhanced soldiers
with access to regenerative medical treatments not available to their
enemies will be far from the full extent of the impact of the biotech
RMA. One]{.underline} \$3 billion [program]{.underline}, begun in 2002,
[is intended to create a "metabolically dominant soldier" who will be
enabled by gene therapy to lift up to 800lbs, block pain
receptors]{.underline} for days, [and "run at Olympic sprint speeds for
15 minutes]{.underline} on one breath of air" (Sokolove 2007). And
[if]{.underline} neural or cybernetic prostheses and [gene therapy do
not eventually produce a Captain America]{.underline}, the contributions
of other [research programs may still permit the fielding of a
biomimetic Spiderman]{.underline}: The Z[-Man program will develop
biologically inspired climbing aids that will enable an individual
soldier to scale vertical walls]{.underline} constructed of typical
building materials without the need for ropes or ladders. The
inspiration for these climbing aids is the way geckos, spiders, and
small animals scale vertical surfaces.... The overall goal of the
program is to enable an individual soldier using Z-Man technologies to
scale a vertical surface while carrying a full combat load. (DARPA,
"Z-Man" 2010) DARPA has offered "a proof-of-concept demonstration of a
16-square-inch sheet of Geckskin adhering to a vertical glass wall while
supporting a static load of up to 660 pounds" (DARPA, "Z-Man" 2013).
This is perhaps the most outlandish example of how biotechnologies are
being developed to aid in military power projection capabilities, but it
is by no means the only one. [Another, completed biomimetic project
increased]{.underline} the [efficiency of human swimmers by 80% and more
than doubled their speed]{.underline} by giving them oscillating foils
based on the propulsion mechanisms used by some fish and sea birds
(DARPA, "PowerSwim" 2010). And a project to achieve Rapid Altitude and
Hypoxia Acclimatization would permit the fielding of troops (perhaps in
potential battle zones such as the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas) with
"novel pharmacological, biological, and technological approaches to
adapt to high altitudes (4000--6000 meters)" (DARPA, "RAHA" 2010). The
adoption of biotechnology to enable force projection began during the
colonial era, when Europeans discovered that quinine could prevent
malaria, thus opening the door for the Scramble for Africa. Shortages of
anti-malarial drugs during World War II caused such high morbidity rates
among American personnel serving in the Pacific that General Douglas
MacArthur remarked that the campaign would be a slow one unless
additional measures were taken (Marble 2010). In the twenty-first
century, anti-malarial drugs remain a challenge to force projection.
Mefloquine, a comparatively affordable anti-malarial also marketed as
Lariam, has severe psychiatric side effects, first noted in the Vietnam
War. Problems include psychotic behavior, paranoia, and hallucinations.
A 2003 report indicated that "Mefloquine use was a factor in half of the
suicides among troops in Iraq in 2003 -- and how suicides dropped by 50%
after the Army stopped handing out the drug." Its use was also linked to
murders and suicides by Special Forces personnel in Afghanistan
2002--2004 (Benjamin 2012). In 2012, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
Lariam, notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it had been
alerted by a physician that a patient with traumatic brain injury taking
the drug, presumed to be a serviceman charged in a high-profile massacre
of civilians, had committed a homicide involving 17 victims (Ritchie
2013). When difficulties with malaria mounted during the Vietnam War,
including transmission back to America, the United States Navy utilized
recombinant technology to develop a DNA vaccine to prevent malaria
infections. When the program began in the 1990s, the majority of troop
deployments, aside from Bosnia, were to malarial regions, and the
Plasmodium parasites were the top cause of casualties in Somalia. In
tests announced in 1998, research teams were immunized with Plasmodium
DNA, with the majority of participants developing T-cells that function
as antibodies when confronted with malarial parasites. This development
involved the creation of malaria vectors that functioned like common
vaccines, potentially opening the way to safer deployments for American
Marines (Gillert 1998). The advent of DNA vaccines of this type
theoretically allows scientists to develop vaccinations against all
known diseases. The Naval Medical Research Institute therefore created a
"phage library" for the purposes of developing antibodies to all
possible strains of infectious agents (Wang 1998). As the technology is
further developed, the militaries of advanced states will increasingly
turn to active biotech solutions to biological threats, rather than
pharmaceutical prophylactics. However, [with defense planners concerned
by the possibility of the use of genetically modified bioweapons by
rogue and non-state actors, they will also conduct further research into
**countering genetically engineered vectors** that might be created to
replace the naturally occurring agents against which American forces are
already protected]{.underline} (Department of Defense 1998). DARPA's
(2013) "7 Day Biodefense" program seeks [to **develop persistent and
transient immunities** to unspecified pathogens]{.underline} out of the
recognition that unfamiliar agents would likely be employed in a major
biowarfare attack. Benign uses of Frankenfoods The apparent arrival of
the end of germ warfare for military biotech purposes does not portend
the resolution of the dual-use dilemma. As the planners of the AMP
project note, it is still necessary to work with deadly pathogens if one
is to find treatments for them. Another commercial sector field that is
experiencing securitization, and is already highly controversial in its
own right, is genetically modified food. Called "Frankenfoods" by their
vocal detractors and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by
agribusiness, they represent a growing number of plant and animal
products that have been the recipients of recombinant engineering to,
among other results, increase their yield, improve their flavor, or
lengthen their shelf lives. GMOs potentially hold a number of
possibilities for military purposes. As far back as 1960, the United
States Air Force and Navy funded studies to determine whether ions
accelerated plant growth and could thereby feed troops on forward
deployments (Krueger et al. 1962). More recently, the Army has initiated
programs to develop crops with enhanced levels of nutritional
components, built-in vaccines, or edible factors that impart resistance
to spoilage (Committee 2001, p. 53). In particular, "functional foods"
are expected to reduce logistical demands, which would enable more
efficient power projection. Such foods have been modified to provide
more than their normal nutritional value. Instead, they can contain
nutraceuticals "such as naturally occurring antimicrobials that inhibit
certain pathogens known to exist in a given operational area. Or foods
could be designed with vaccines in them, and an army could be vaccinated
quickly and efficiently by distributing genetically engineered food"
(Armstrong and Warner 2003). Genetically modified food is also being
developed to be highly digestible to reduce the quantity of rations that
require transportation, and with biomarkers to distinguish the ingestor
as friendly under battlefield or peacekeeping scans (Egudo 2004, p. 14).
Future plans call for each soldier to be outfitted with \[such\] a
wearable computer system to provide situational awareness displays,
analysis of sensor and targeting data, and communications. \[The
prototype\] is capable of withstanding virtually any environmental
abuse, including extended submersion in water ... Such devices take an
input data block and scan it against stored images. One practical
military application is for the rapid battlefield identification of
friend or foe. (Armstrong and Warner 2003) The Army Land Warrior Program
is scheduled to provide each combat soldier with a wearable computer to
assist with the processing of sensor and targeting data, situational
awareness displays, and communications. As the use of graphical formats
to facilitate the assimilation of information in real time increases,
the Army will have a growing need for computer memory capacity on the
battlefield. In principle, an optical 3-D memory based on bacteria
polymers can store roughly three orders of magnitude more information in
the same size enclosure than a two-dimensional optical disk. (Committee
2001, pp. 27--28) These advancements were followed by the use of a
single gram of synthetic DNA to store 700 terabytes of data -- or the
equivalent of 70,000 movies -- indefinitely in a transportable
freeze-dried form (Ingham 2013). While new biomaterials (incorporating
biological organisms or their outputs) must be reviewed and approved by
the Federal FDA for safety and efficacy, substances that are merely
biomimetic (or "bioinspired") do not face this hurdle. One such example,
developed by the United States National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is the fastener Velcro. In addition to augmenting
soldiers by giving them the proportional strength of insects, military
planners also hope to endow them with lightweight body armor that
absorbs impacts as efficiently as the exoskeletons of mollusks
(Armstrong and Warner 2003). "On a strength-to-weight basis, the abalone
shell has armor protection capabilities equal to or greater than those
of existing materials ... When laminated hierarchical structures of
biological systems (e.g. the nacre of abalone shell) are mimicked ...
significant improvements in the composite mechanical properties have
been observed" (Committee 2001, p. 43). Imaging and surveillance Enzyme
research also entails the development of "bioreceptors" comprised of
thin films with photoelectronic properties. Processes recently developed
include integrating lightsensitive proteins into optical devices,
particularly for laser eye protection, polymerbased batteries, and
electromagnetic shielding. Bioreceptors can also detect the presence of
selected DNA, which makes them useful in identifying infectious agents
(United States Army: New Materials Development Using Biotechnology
Process 1998). "A network of biosensors could considerably improve a
commander's view of the battlefield. Some researchers envision soldiers
wearing wristwatch-style biosensors that are sensitive to a variety of
target molecules. In effect, each solider would become a detection
device and warn of a possible biological or chemical attack. Also, such
sensors could be used to monitor the health and well-being of entire
units" (Armstrong and Warner 2003). But still other efforts have made
tremendous progress in reducing the role of humans in collecting data
and replacing them with other agents: insects. Although the United
States Army may have experimented with mosquitoes as bioweapon delivery
systems in the 1960s (Maurer, in Maurer 2009, p. 96); in 2009,
DARPA-funded engineers at the University of California, Berkeley,
announced that they had developed cyborg beetles that they could direct
by remote control. The researchers implanted electrodes into the brains
and muscles of two species of beetle, which could then be made to fly
and maneuver on command, for use in recover and spying missions
(Callaway 2009). DARPA describes its Hybrid Insect MEMS Program as
follows: The animal world has provided mankind with locomotion over
millennia.... The HI-MEMS program is aimed to develop technology that
provides more control over insect locomotion, just as saddles and
horseshoes are needed for horse locomotion control ... The realization
of cyborgs with most of the machine component inside the insect body
will provide stealthy robots that use muscle actuators which have been
developed over millions of years of evolution. (DARPA, "HI-MEMS" 2010)
Prior to the insect agents, DARPA had already created a "roborat," a
rodent controlled by a neural prosthesis via a laptop keyboard so that
it could climb stairs and navigate mazes, which Director Goldblatt
compared to a child's remote-controlled car. Further developments
included mounted cameras for visual data collection, and prostheses
implanted along the rat's belly so that it would not be observed. The
neural prostheses stimulated the rats' pleasure centers, motivating them
on in their tasks, and Moreno (2006, pp. 43--44) notes that there are
obvious implications for how such prostheses could be adapted to human
subjects as well. Exotic weaponry Whether commanding a fleet of drone
bees along with drone aircraft, or a company of super-soldier Augments
with the abilities of insects, the United States and its technologically
advanced allies and competitors are assuming the capacity to wage
conventional warfare and espionage in a manner that will not soon be
available to internal or regional adversaries or to non-state
antagonists. But it is in the area of novel bioweapons where hegemonic
actors stand poised to offer attacks against which their adversaries
could mount no possible defense. Currently, many potential lines of
research are banned under the terms of the BWC, but even if state actors
abide by its terms, private sector breakthroughs will continue to have
dual-use capabilities that can be studied. Indeed, some of them have
already caused outbursts of political violence internationally. Genetic
weapons Until the end of the twentieth century, bioweapons meant
pathogens (and possibly animal delivery systems). The biotech
revolution, and particularly the ability to sequence and translate
entire genomes, has altered that equation. [Some state militaries,
notably **China's**, are **already publicly expressing an interest in
attacking targets** by reordering their bodily functions
through]{.underline} what is known in more benign applications as [gene
therapy]{.underline}. Planners in the United States also note that: [The
long term implications of genomics will present the Army with
opportunities and challenges]{.underline} even in the next decade ...
The [Army can, however, promote development of new products and
processes that will be consistent with or specific to its missions and
needs]{.underline}. This will require that the Army be fully aware of
the synergistic effects of biological tools. (Committee 2001, p. 15)
"The goal of gene therapy is to effect a change in the genetic makeup of
an individual by introducing new information designed to replace or
repair a faulty gene." This is accomplished by using the same principle
employed since the first smallpox vaccination: the use of a harnessed,
crippled virus to serve as a "Trojan horse" vector, in this case bearing
replacement or supplemental genes to alter cell functioning. Somatic
cell therapy affects only the cells of the individual receiving it, and
for reasons of ethics and technical feasibility, most therapeutic
research has been of this type. But there is also the technique of
germline cell therapy, which might "lead to a heritable change that
could repair problems for all future generations" (Block, in Drell et
al. 1999, pp. 60--62). Although American military planners are bullish
on the potential for gene therapy to improve the lots of wounded
servicemen in the near future, the technologies are not yet universally
acclaimed nor even accepted. The United States Department of Energy
(2009) noted that the FDA "has not yet \[as of 2014\] approved any human
gene therapy product for sale. Current gene therapy is experimental and
has not proven very successful in clinical trials. Little progress has
been made since the first gene therapy clinical trial began in 1990."
This reaction stems in part from the death and illness of several
children who had received gene therapies to treat life-threatening
chronic conditions. At the same time, however, researchers elsewhere
announced that gene therapy safely and successfully restored partial
sight to congenitally blind test subjects. The results were accomplished
by inserting healthy copies of a missing gene into patient retina cells
via a vector manufactured by a private American company called Targeted
Genetics (University College of London 2008). Vector-delivered gene
therapies remain an emerging biotechnology, but cases such as these
demonstrate both that vectors can be used to create significant physical
alterations in targets, and that these changes can be deadly. The
discovery that viruses can be carried airborne for considerable
distances even after the droplets of fluid constituting their
transmission media have fallen to the ground provides further evidence
that vectors might soon be used to deliver genetic therapies -- or
maladies -- to wide target populations (The Medical News 2007). With the
genetic maps of entire organisms now available -- the full genome for
the plague bacterium was decoded in 2001 -- it is inevitable that
researchers will develop the means to rewrite specified segments of
targeted genes (Preston 2009, p. 296). Direct effect weapons The United
States military is currently developing "a set of design and synthesis
processes that will enable the specification of a desired function, and
be able to rapidly synthesize a protein that performs the function."
Rather than modifying existing proteins, this biotechnology would allow
the creation of new proteins based on specific performance objectives
(DARPA, "Protein Design Processes" 1998). The field of genetic protein
decoding and engineering of this kind is known as proteomics (Committee
2001, p. 15). Understanding the functions of proteins is key to opening
entirely new frontiers in medicine -- and warfare. Already, researchers
have destroyed targeted cancer cells by using engineered nanoparticles
to deliver genes only to the tumor and not to healthy neighboring
tissue. Once the genes were inserted, they stimulated the production of
a protein that selectively destroys the cancer (BBC News 2009). However,
proteomics also opens a different avenue of potential development in
biotechnological attacks in shifting away from infectious agents to
targeting human bioregulators, natural substances in the body that
control automatic processes such as blood pressure and immune responses.
Alibek (1999) claimed that the Soviet Union pursued this research into
"direct effect weapons" in the 1980s to circumvent the BWC. The result
would not actually be an illness, but the turning of the body against
itself through disruption, and projects along these lines have at least
been considered (Huang and Kosal 2008, p. 9, Preston 2009, pp.
313--314). Interfering with some of the body's neurotransmitters, for
example, could cause memory loss, panic disorder, or depression (Dando,
in Pearson et al. 2007, pp. 133--134). NATO has listed "chemical
technologies that could act on the central nervous system" as
"technologies of interest" (Pearson, in Pearson et al. 2007, p. 89).
[Chinese researchers]{.underline} Guo and Yang (2005) directly
[addressed the security applications of such efforts in proteomics,
arguing: Direct-effect weapons ... can cause destruction]{.underline}
that is both [more powerful and more civilized than that caused by
conventional killing methods like]{.underline} gunpowder or **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** ... [A military attack]{.underline}, therefore,
[might wound an enemy's genes]{.underline}, proteins, cells, tissues,
and organs, [causing more damage than conventional weapons
could.]{.underline} However, such devastating, nonlethal effects will
require us to pacify the enemy through postwar reconstruction efforts
and hatred control ... \[W\]e could create a microbullet out of a 1
micron tungsten or gold ion, on whose surface plasmid DNA or naked DNA
could be precipitated, and deliver the bullet via a gunpowder explosion,
electron transmission, or high-pressured gas to penetrate the body
surface. We could then release DNA molecules to integrate with the
host's cells through blood circulation and cause disease or injury by
controlling genes. [Around the same time, an American biodefense expert
added that: If one can disrupt unit loyalty through fear or another
emotion, the **army would cease to exist as a fighting
force**.]{.underline} Claustrophobia would make soldiers tear off their
protective face mask. Fear, thirst, accelerated heart rate,
hypermotility of the gut -- these would be the desired peptide effects.
[Delivery would be accomplished using engineered pathogens, and their
primary role in biowarfare would be as delivery systems for direct
effect weapons rather than the transmission of infectious
disease]{.underline} (Moreno 2006, pp. 178--179). The international
balance of power With [the emergence of advanced biotechnologies, many
of which already exist or are being developed for expressly military
purposes, the United States holds the potential for achieving a
**decisive advantage in power projection capabilities**]{.underline}
beyond the reach of its current adversaries and most of its likely
potential competitors. [Besides the United States, other actors are
expanding their biotech R&D sectors, notably the **emerging great powers
China**]{.underline} and India, [where force planners must consider the
usage of bioweapons in Asian theaters of combat]{.underline} in both
classical and modern times (Clunan et al. 2008). [China is developing
its military capabilities to become a regional power at the least, and
advanced **biotech**nologies **could play a role in this
effort**]{.underline}. "As the Chinese military expands its power
projection capabilities, [it will **concentrate on creating asymmetrical
advantages** in the face of **superior US conventional
technology**]{.underline}" (NTI 2003). Chinese military medical
researchers have written a number of articles proposing the use of
proteomic weapons to engage in non-lethal "precision injury" attacks
that could be healed upon enemy surrender as evidence of hegemonic
"mercifulness." Despite the evident offensive strategic potential of
such research -- one such article is titled "The Command of
Biotechnology and Merciful Conquest" -- there is still evidence of the
constraints of international norms against biowarfare. Indeed, the
author claims that biotech warfare approaches "abide by the Biological
and Toxin Weapons Convention more effectively, and strike a blow on the
traditional bioweapons, therefore welcoming new military progresses and
reforms, and changing the notions and civilization level of war" (Guo
2006, pp. 1152--1154). India, with its reliance on the Green revolution
to attempt to achieve food sufficiency, has spent the last two decades
encouraging the development of agricultural biotechnologies. Many of
these advances were facilitated using extensive knowledge of genetic
engineering, which in turn provided information on the de novo synthesis
of biological agents. Whether such synthesis has actually been done is
uncertain. India has made substantial efforts to prepare its military
force for a biological attack. In December of 1998, India began to train
its medical personnel to deal with the eventualities of such an attack.
(NTI 2009) India's equivalent of DARPA, the Defense Research &
Development Organization operates a network of 52 laboratories whose
research includes life sciences for military purposes. These include the
Defense Institute of High-Altitude Research and the Defense Food
Research Laboratory (Department of Biotechnology, Government of India
2013, p. 20). Its reported products parallel those investigated by its
American counterparts, including treatments to combat altitude sickness,
transgenic crops, and protective polymers for uniforms, although
products are frequently described in terms of their commercial rather
than strategic potentials (Defense Research & Development Organization
2015). [One widely cited potential threat to international security from
biotechnology is that, as more actors become involved in research into
militarized biotechnology,]{.underline} the [threat of dissemination to
non-state actors increases]{.underline} through the increased
availability of production equipment and available data. Maurer (in
Maurer 2009, p. 86) notes that commercially available micronizers are
sold that can produce 1--10 μm particles, and in their advertising
material, the "companies boast that they can be operated by 'anyone ...
in their garage.'" And non-state actors with interests in such
technologies have been quite busy utilizing such machinery in the past
decade, with individuals referred to as "garage hackers" operating
autonomously with small pieces of equipment and biological material that
can be purchased from suppliers over the internet (United States House
of Representatives 2005, p. 30). Still, [because such **proliferation
occurs over time**, and because **research by defense establishments
will continue**]{.underline} during this period, [including in
biodefense, the most sophisticated uses of biotech will **remain in the
arsenals of advanced state actors**]{.underline} just as they do with
conventional armaments today, despite the proliferation of surplus
conventional arms. [**Rather than** being the **"poor man's nuclear
weapon**," twenty-first-century biotechnology will actually provide a
**decided asymmetrical advantage** to major powers that will
**complement their superiority**]{.underline} in conventional forces.
[Technologically advanced states will be far more likely to be able to
counter classical "germ warfare"]{.underline} like anthrax attacks [by
rogue states and non-state groups than will be actors bereft of a
biotech industry]{.underline} to mount defenses against vectors that
introduce engineered viruses, or proteomic weapons that disrupt human
bioregulators. Re-evaluating Human Security after the Biotech RMA It
might be asked whether, for all the novelty of the particular
technologies described, there is anything genuinely qualitatively
different from any other technological developments that improved the
effectiveness and reach of fighters, going back to clubs and spears. In
describing efforts to enhance cognitive functioning, Bostrom and
Savulescu (cited in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 2) ask "How is taking
modafinil fundamentally different from imbibing a good cup of tea? How
is either morally different from getting a good night's sleep?" They
note that even simple shoes can arguably be called a technological human
enhancement over bare feet. Sandel (in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, pp.
73--74) adds that it is otherness rather than fairness that is the
objection to human enhancement in sports because different athletes have
different physical capabilities to begin with. Certainly this
distinction would apply to states as well. Wheelis (in Pearson et al.
2007, p. 4) argues that there is no real incentive for states to spend
billions of dollars in a bid to develop lethal neurotransmitter
disruptors when they have effective conventional armaments. He does,
however, note the potential power of such technology for purposes of
incapacitation. A natural extension would be the use of coercion against
the incapacitated (e.g. Tell us where the rebels are hiding and your
blood pressure will return to normal). Perhaps the greatest threat to
international stability in the genomic age is the international
emergence of two classes of humankind, separated by disparities in
living conditions far wider than those between the developed and
developing worlds today. Described by biologist Lee Silver, this would
be "a two-class system with rich, genetically enhanced 'GenRich' types
lording it over poorer, inferior 'Naturals,'" on a global scale
(Armstrong and Warner 2003). Ultimately, the perception of injustice by
the multitude of the have-nots would render such a system unstable (Carr
1964, Bull 2002). [What these biotechnologies **do not disrupt is order
within the international system**]{.underline}. [In the
past]{.underline}, advances in weapons technology have been condemned as
immoral in part because the most [powerful actors]{.underline}, whether
states or rulers, [viewed them as challenges to their
hegemony]{.underline}. Today, [terrorists and rogue states are imputed
to have a desire to use bioweapons]{.underline}, meaning to release
pathogens against civilian targets, [but few outcries have been heard
over the legitimacy of the advantages conferred by other biotechnologies
upon what are already the strongest actors]{.underline}. In this sense,
[the biotech RMA is more **akin to** the development of **status
quo-reinforcing asymmetric weapons** technologies]{.underline} [like
machine guns, which were not condemned by hegemonic powers,]{.underline}
than by potentially status quo-disruptive asymmetric technologies such
as chemical warfare (Price 1997, pp. 2--6). [While matching advanced
technology is a challenge to would-be competitors, it is not an
insurmountable one]{.underline} (Quille, in Lewer 2002, p. 45). And it
might actually inspire new forms of lower cost asymmetric
counter-attacks, as attempts to use model airplanes as drones to attack
American targets by would-be terrorists demonstrates. [But **for now**,
as with the nuclear club, **with their overwhelming edge** in both
offensive and defensive capabilities, the United States and other
advanced industrial nations can rest assured that their **military** and
economic **dominance**]{.underline} of the international system **[is in
no jeopardy]{.underline}**. [Biotech]{.underline}nology, often cited as
an asymmetric threat to conventional power projection capabilities, [is
being **harnessed by those very militaries as a force multiplier**, and
their R&D and production capabilities far outstrip those of any possible
combination of rogue states and terrorist groups]{.underline}. The
biotech RMA is well underway, and states are free to shift their
attention from international to internal biological threats. Many of
these developments are already occurring without an informed public
debate and, indeed, many of the biotechnologies outlined in this paper
doubtless seem too fantastical to warrant serious consideration. But
j[ust as most of the public and decision- makers would have **dismissed
the plausibility of atomic weapons** before Hiroshima, and were unaware
before the invasion of Afghanistan that drones were already in
existence, **so too are the seemingly far-fetched** qualities of
advanced **biotech**]{.underline}nology [**already manifesting
themselves** in super-solider planning and budgeting in the United
States and elsewhere.]{.underline}

#### Nanotech and cognitive warfare causes [dangerous arms racing]{.underline} and [machinic warfare]{.underline}.

Stephen **Bryen 20**, served as a deputy undersecretary of Defense and
as the director of the Defense Technology Security Administration,
senior fellow at the American Center for Democracy, "Line between
warrior and machine blurs as China and U.S. military use artificial
intelligence",

//lenox

The arrest of Harvard Professor Charles Lieber for failing to reveal his
work for the Chinese is more than alarming. One of the world's leading
experts in nanotechnology, Mr. [Lieber contributed to China's Thousand
Talents Program and assisted China in its **military arms
race**]{.underline} with the United States, whether knowingly or not.
[Americans should be concerned that China is pursuing **military
nanotechnology** solutions, including **linking soldiers' brains
directly to computers**]{.underline}. 

Since at least 2000, when President Clinton proclaimed his National
Nanotechnology Initiative, U.S. government agencies have been heavily
engaged in nanotechnology research. A significant part of the work has
been funded by the Defense Department, and the long-term goal is to
create a new kind of warrior linking the human brain to machines, to
millions of sensors and to the computer cloud. If successful, the
capability of the human brain would be expanded exponentially. [For the
warfighter, the complete integration of sensors to shooters and
near-perfect situational awareness would create a formidable soldier,
and if in the hands of an enemy, a **highly dangerous
adversary**]{.underline}.

The [American military, especially since the microelectronics
revolution, has based its superiority on technology as a **force
multiplier**]{.underline}, permitting the United States to field smaller
but much more lethal forces. [China is **rapidly** catching up with the
U.S. military, a source of deep worry in Washington]{.underline}.

As more and more military operations begin to rely on artificial
intelligence, a field actively pursued by the Pentagon and by the
People's Liberation Army of China, [the line between the **warrior and
machines** starts to **blur**]{.underline}. [Connect the human brain
directly to the computers and systems making critical calculation, and
the **character of the war fighter is forever changed**]{.underline},
assuming it is possible.

The Defense Department in 2018 published a major study called "Cyborg
Soldier 2050, Human/Machine fusion and the Implications for the Future
of the DoD." The study proclaimed :

"... [neural implants for brain--computer interfacing would allow for
seamless interaction between individuals and secondary assets
(machines]{.underline}). This [control could be exerted upon **drones**,
**weapon systems**, and **other remote systems** operated by an
**enhanced individual**]{.underline}. The enhancement would not simply
entail user control of equipment (brain to machine) but also
transmission to operator (machine to brain) and human to human (command
and control dynamics) to enhance situational awareness as drone,
computational analytical, and human information is relayed to the
operator."

While the Defense Department is aiming at 2050, inventor and
futurologist Ray Kurzweil sees the mind-machine interface happening by
2030, where he says the 300 million or so "very general" pattern
"recognizers" in the brain can be expanded by creating a synthetic
neo-cortex linking the brain to the cloud and merging artificial and
human intelligence together. This will be achieved by nano-scale brain
implants.

Mr. [Lieber and his partners were working on **exactly this type** of
technology]{.underline} and received substantial funding from the
Department of Defense and many of its agencies. Mr. Lieber and his
colleagues were awarded a number of patents, but the most important one
appears to be a 2015 patent award called "Systems and Methods for
\[nano-scale\] Injectable Devices." The idea of the 2015 patent was to
inject a nano-scale matrix into the brain and creating a brain interface
that could be linked to machines.

Research for this patent was funded by the Defense Department and the
National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights to the
invention, according to the patent application.

Mr. [Lieber has been accused by the U.S. government of **concealing
information** about the work he was doing in China]{.underline}. In
2015, Mr. Lieber was elected as a foreign member of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.

In 2015, the same year that Mr. Lieber was awarded a patent enabling
nanotechnology implants for the human brain, [Pentagon officials sounded
the alarm about China working on their own **cyborg
project**]{.underline}. Then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work
said: "Now [our **adversaries**]{.underline}, quite frankly, [are
pursuing **enhanced** human operations]{.underline}, and it scares the
crap out of us."   

Cyborg technology is also being commercialized. Elon Musk's company
Neuralink is now entering the animal-testing phase and states that it
will start experiments on humans in 2020. Mr. Lieber is one of the
consulting scientists at Neuralink. Mr. Musk has invested \$100 million
of his money in this startup and is raising additional funds.  

Whether 2050 or 2030 or in the next few years the first Cyborg Warrior
may actually appear. Will it be an American Cyborg or from China? No one
knows.

### 1NC -- ! -- Bioweapons

#### China is [sprinting]{.underline} towards development of [bioweapons.]{.underline}

ambitions,\"

[China's BW capabilities]{.underline}

In 1999, [the US]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DoD) assessed
China to have]{.underline}, in addition to ballistic and cruise
missiles, "[a variety of fighters, bombers, helicopters, artillery,
rockets, mortars, and **sprayers** available as potential **means of
delivery** for NBC \[nuclear, **biological**, and chemical\]
weapons]{.underline}." In a 2001 report, DoD added that "China possesses
an advanced biotechnology infrastructure as well as the requisite
munitions production capabilities necessary to develop, produce, and
weaponise biological agents."

Over the years, China is said to have researched potential BW
agents---such as the causative agents of tularemia, Q fever, plague,
anthrax, eastern equine encephalitis, and psittacosis---and possess the
technology to mass-produce most traditional BW agents---including the
causative agents of anthrax, tularemia, and botulism. There is also the
possibility that China has weaponised ricin, botulinum toxins, and the
causative agents of anthrax, cholera, plague, and tularemia. Highly
virulent viruses such as SARS, influenza H5N1, Japanese encephalitis,
and dengue have been studied at the now infamous Wuhan Institute of
Virology as well.

Over the years, [China is said to have researched potential BW
agents---such as the **causative agents** of tularemia, Q fever,
**plague**, **anthrax,** eastern equine encephalitis, and
psittacosis---and possess the technology to **mass-produce** most
traditional **BW agents**]{.underline}

[China also seems to be interested in aerobiology. Laboratory-scale
aerosolisation experiments with microorganisms have reportedly been
conducted, and China itself, in its voluntary confidence-building
declarations under the BWC, has listed its research on biological
aerosols. Li Yimin, a Chinese biological weapons specialist, has praised
BW agent aerosols for their effectiveness over very large areas as
well.]{.underline}

Interestingly, in 1993, [Beijing declared eight research facilities as
having a "national defencive **biological warfare R&D
programme**]{.underline}." These included vaccine-producing facilities,
such as the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products that is used by
Sinopharm. Since then, [a 2015 study has found 12 facilities affiliated
with the governmental defense establishment and **30 facilities**
affiliated with the PLA to be **involved in the research**, development,
production, testing, or storage of **biological weapons**]{.underline}.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology was not amongst these facilities, though
the US has recently determined it to have "collaborated on publications
and secret projects with China's military" and "engaged in classified
research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the
Chinese military since at least 2017."

Even though assessing China's military capabilities is notoriously
difficult due to the level of secrecy and opacity its institutions
maintain, a combination of historical records, assessments, and studies
provide a view behind the Great Wall. [When it comes to China's BW
programme, this **view is unsettling**.]{.underline} The way forward,
however, should not be the proliferation of biological weapons. Instead,
it should be their global destruction. [Just as it is unwise to
interfere with nature, so is weaponising and fighting wars with it. The
c**onsequences** could be even more **disastrous** than the ongoing
pandemic.]{.underline}

#### Guarantees [extinction]{.underline} -- defense doesn't assume [cascading effects.]{.underline}

Nura A. **Abboud 21**, Founder of the Jordanian Society for Microbial
Biodiversity, 9-21-2021, \"Catastrophic Impacts of Biological Warfare on
Biodiversity,\"
<https://www.ecomena.org/impacts-of-biological-warfare-on-biodiversity/>,
cy

[**Biological weapons** are]{.underline} considered [the **most
dangerous** of all known **weapons of mass destruction**. They are used
to deliberately cause epidemics among humans; destroy the environmental
components, including water, air, and soil; and target crops and
livestock.]{.underline} Examples of diseases used in biological warfare
include [anthrax, smallpox, plague, cholera, and avian flu]{.underline}.
In addition to the [**catastrophic effects** of biological warfare
on]{.underline} the [**biodiversity** and the
**environment**]{.underline}, their danger lies in their low cost and
rapid spread, as well as their easy preparation, transport, and use.

[Unlike nuclear and chemical bombs, biological bombs]{.underline} are
without odor or color and therefore [cannot be detected]{.underline}.
Additionally, [bioweapons are dangerous because of their effects on
untargeted organisms in a military attack, and the clinical symptoms
they create may be difficult to distinguish from normal diseases.
Bioweapon pathogens remain in nature for several years]{.underline} and
are able to survive in harsh environmental conditions.

Threat to Natural Resources

[Bioweapons spread germs that **contaminate air,** food, water, and the
environment, causing **epidemiological diseases** for different living
organisms.]{.underline}

Air: A wide variety of germs can contaminate air and are used in
biological warfare. [Fungi]{.underline} are the most common, and they
travel by air over long distances to [infect healthy
plants.]{.underline}

Food: **[Food contamination]{.underline}** is also one of the most
powerful methods used to carry out biological warfare attacks. [Disease
is transmitted either directly to humans through contaminated food or
drink]{.underline} or indirectly by hosts.

Water: Water can spread a number of lethal infectious agents as well.
For example, one gram of Clostridium tetani poison is able to kill eight
million people within six hours.

Threats to Biodiversity

[Diseases are one of the **main drivers of extinction**]{.underline} in
endangered species; therefore, [disease control is fundamental to
preserve biodiversity.]{.underline} Despite the presence of
**[vaccines]{.underline}** and drugs for most bioweapons, they [may
**not** be **available** in adequate quantities]{.underline} to cope
with an epidemiological disease outbreak.

Biological attacks pose a threat to naturally rare wild plants and
animals and to species whose natural habitats have been degraded by
human activities. Furthermore, diseases that humans, domestic animals,
and domestic plants have been able to develop immunity to can be fatal
in wild animals and plants. Bioweapons are not only having direct
effects on the genetic biodiversity of indigenous species but also are
having direct and indirect catastrophic effects on vital plant and
animal communities.

Threats to Animal Biodiversity

Conservation of livestock breeds is essential to maintaining genetic
diversity, which in turn is vital to increasing the ability of living
organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The danger of bioweapons
regarding animal biodiversity is summarized in three main points:

1\. The direct impact of diseases on wild species

Some deadly diseases in humans or domestic animals can infect wild
animals. For instance, an epidemic destructive impact on endangered
species is reflected in the effects of Canine distemper, a natural viral
disease that infects wild dogs and wild animals belonging to the same
group. Canine distemper was also developed in bioweapon laboratories.

Over the past decade, the spread of this disease has resulted in habitat
loss and in the extinction of a large number of wild species in North
America. Additionally, it led to the elimination of about one-third of
the lion population in Tanzania and had serious impacts on the
endangered leopard population.

2\. Invasive species

The history of rinderpest in Africa provides a model for predicting the
potential effects of lethal diseases on wild species and livestock. In
1887, European colonial armies introduced the rinderpest virus to Africa
through imported cattle, which led to a rinderpest outbreak among
domestic cattle breeds and wild species, killing an estimated 90--95% of
African cattle and buffaloes within three years.

To control the epidemic, African herds and buffaloes have been destroyed
in most parts of Africa. Despite efforts to combat rinderpest over the
past century, the disease is still strong, and its outbreak in the
region occurs frequently.

3\. Elimination of animal species, hosts, and vectors

Threatened species may be destroyed in areas that have been subjected to
biological attacks with the aim of eradicating the disease. For example,
in the United States, programs to control brucellosis in livestock have
resulted in killing large numbers of wild animals, including the Bison
and the white tailed deer.

Threats to Plant Biodiversity

[Microbes can be used in crop destruction.]{.underline} For instance,
"Rice blast" is a disease affecting rice and therefore leads to crop
destruction and genetic changes in the plant.

Conclusion

The discussion about controlling destructive [bioweapons]{.underline} is
growing, as they [**pose a vast danger** to both **humanity** and the
**environment**]{.underline} alike. Any failure to prevent biological
attacks can lead to the deterioration of genetic diversity in animals
and plants, the extinction of endangered species, and the destruction of
human livelihoods and traditional cultures.

#### Must act now -- new tech developments will undermine second strike

Politics at the University of Leicester, Honorary Fellow at the

February 2021, European Journal of International Security, 6(3),
257-277. doi:10.1017/eis.2021.2

The combined effects of SNNW and the implications for the Third Nuclear
Age [The move towards a **Third Nuclear Age** has four significant
**technological developments**]{.underline}, each [facilitated
by]{.underline} the latest information technology revolution and by
[enormous shifts in computing, processing, and sensing
power]{.underline}. Taken together, [these dynamics are continuing to
push the policy focus]{.underline} away from nuclear punishment towards
[non-nuclear denial]{.underline}, blurring the distinction between
offence and defence, [and creating a more]{.underline} fluid, complex,
and potentially **[dangerous nuclear order]{.underline}**.

[The first key component]{.underline} of the Third Nuclear Age
[is]{.underline} the growing perception that strategic forces and
population centres could be protected against nuclear attacks with
**[missile defences]{.underline}**. While the pursuit of missile
defences can be traced back to the 1940s, it has only really been in the
last twenty years that the [technology has matured to a point whereby
interception]{.underline} by conventional hit-to-kill technologies
[might credibly be deployed against certain]{.underline} types of
[threats]{.underline}, and that the political debate that surrounds the
use of anti-missile defences has become normalised.36 The US, Russia,
China and India have all deployed or are in the process of deploying
ballistic missile defences.37

[The second set of dynamics is]{.underline} the maturation and spread of
[non-nuclear weapons that might]{.underline} be used to [threaten an
adversary's nuclear and associated systems]{.underline}. Historically
this was a mission that could only be carried out -- or at least was
most efficiently carried out -- through the use of nuclear weapons. But
[major advances in precision, tracking, sensing, and
processing]{.underline} power [has meant that these tasks can now
potentially be undertaken with non-nuclear weaponry]{.underline}. In the
short term, [this **raises the possibility** of a state]{.underline}
conducting, threatening (or at least being misperceived as threatening),
a non-nuclear **[disarming first strike]{.underline}** against another,
especially against states with smaller and less sophisticated nuclear
arsenals (for example, North Korea). [It also creates greater chances
for states to misperceive]{.underline} that such an attack is imminent.
In the medium to long term, [it could include all nuclear-armed
states]{.underline}. [These systems include]{.underline}: various
conventional precision/prompt strike weapons, including cruise and
boost-glide [hypersonic weapons]{.underline},38 some of which might be
capable of targeting mobile missiles;39 [new methods of
tracking]{.underline} and attacking [nuclear-armed
submarines]{.underline},40 long seen as one of the least vulnerable
nuclear delivery systems due to their ability to hide in the ocean and
remain undetected41 (whereas silo-based missiles and aircraft can
normally be located); [and counter-space and kinetic and non-kinetic
anti-satellite (ASAT) technologies]{.underline}42 (while ASAT are not
direct counterforce weapon they pose an indirect threat to nuclear
relations, particularly given the reliance of leading nuclear powers on
space for early warning, communications, and intelligence surveillance
and reconnaissance).43

[The third technological driver]{.underline} of the Third Nuclear Age
[is the emergence of **unconventional capabilities** that]{.underline}
provide new means of defending against or attacking an adversary's
nuclear systems. These [include various types of]{.underline} computer
network operations (CNOs), or what are often loosely refer to as
'**[cyber-attacks']{.underline}**. The challenges posed by CNOs are
diverse, and include compromising sensitive nuclear secrets,
exaggerating the risks associated with disruption of the nuclear-supply
chain, the possibility of interfering with early warning and
communications, and the danger that hackers might break into nuclear
command and control systems directly.44 But while [much of
the]{.underline} more popular **[concern about
cyber-attacks]{.underline}** and nuclear weapons [focus on those that
would seek to enable nuclear systems]{.underline} -- that is, cause a
launch/ explosion -- [of primary interest]{.underline} to us here [are
those which seek to **disable them**]{.underline} -- that is, [prevent
nuclear weapons from being used]{.underline} or reduce confidence that
these systems will work as intended when required. These attacks might
be carried out directly against nuclear systems -- [through hacking into
command-and-control apparatus and preventing launch orders]{.underline}
-- [or indirectly by interfering with]{.underline} or spoofing [early
warning systems]{.underline} so that they either see nothing or are
bombarded with false attack information. While nuclear weapons systems
have always been vulnerable to attackers, as well as open to
computer-induced mistakes, [these **challenges are
expanding**]{.underline} in the current digital age. In fact, [the US
has begun planning]{.underline} for the use of cyber-attack capabilities
[against enemy missile and nuclear systems as part of a full spectrum
missile defence]{.underline} or 'left of launch' programme.45 Given the
intangible nature of these capabilities, they are a grave concern for
all nuclear-armed states. In particular, the belief that some systems
may not work when needed severely undermines the notion of a secure,
second-strike capability.

[The fourth element is]{.underline} a new real-time digitised
environment in which global nuclear politics will play out,
characterised by improvements in the ability to target, track, and
monitor an adversary's nuclear capabilities, increasingly [driven by
**artificial intelligence** (AI]{.underline}). Essentially, the latest
information technology revolution is changing both the methods and the
context within which nuclear operations are managed, and a greater
reliance on sophisticated technologies is creating more challenges and
risks that must be understood and addressed. The major change here is in
the technology available to support non-nuclear operations against
nuclear weapons.46 Perhaps most notably [the potential to **incorporate
AI** into both weapons platforms and remote sensing for reconnaissance
and **tracking of** enemy **nuclear forces** or in **managing** more
**autonomous weapons** systems]{.underline}.47 While AI remains in its
infancy[, it could be used to help track, locate, and target enemy
forces in a way not possible before]{.underline}, [and to facilitate
greater autonomy in nuclear]{.underline}/SNNW [systems and provide
better situational awareness]{.underline}.48 More broadly, an ever more
pervasive and complex digital context-or ecosystem49-within which
nuclear operations are carried out also increases the chances of
accidents, miscalculation, and possible inadvertent escalation in the
Third Nuclear Age.50 This in turn means that [current moves towards
nuclear modernisation and greater incorporation of AI]{.underline} [are
likely to **create more problems** in the years ahead]{.underline},51
albeit that the challenge will be different for different actors and
systems.

### 1NC -- Modernization 

#### China's [rapidly modernizing]{.underline}, making escalation [inevitable]{.underline} -- only striking now avoids [extinction.]{.underline}

<https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/08/05/what-s-driving-china-s-nuclear-buildup-pub-85106>,
cy

[China's **nuclear arsenal** appears to be **expanding**
substantially]{.underline} for the first time in years. Over the past
few decades, [China]{.underline} had maintained only about twenty
silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). But recent
evidence from independent U.S. experts shows that the country
[is]{.underline} likely [constructing more than 200 new missile silos.
China's current program to **modernize** and update its nuclear weapons
is moving at an **unprecedented speed** and scale.]{.underline}

[This expansion is poised to change China's]{.underline} traditionally
[small and mostly land-based arsenal]{.underline} across the board.
Besides silo-based ICBMs, [China also is building more road-mobile ICBMs
and strategic **nuclear submarines**, even as it introduces **air-based
nuclear** capabilities.]{.underline} The possibility that [China could
use fissile material]{.underline} produced in civil nuclear facilities
to build up its nuclear warhead stockpile has raised further concerns
because this would eliminate the biggest constraint on China's warhead
stockpiling capacity. The open-ended nature of this expansion, the
abrupt departure from China's long-standing minimalist nuclear policy,
and the lack of any official Chinese confirmation or explanation have
all contributed to confusion and suspicions about Beijing's intentions.

GEOPOLITICS DRIVES CHINA'S MODERNIZATION

For decades[, **China** has **worried** about how U.S. military
capabilities---like missile defense and conventional **precision strike
weapons**---could **undermine** the **credibility** of **China's
capacity** to **retaliate** against a nuclear attack. New improvements
to U.S. capabilities constantly remind Chinese nuclear experts of their
nuclear deterrent's potential vulnerability.]{.underline}

As a result, Chinese experts have consistently agreed that Beijing needs
to continue gradually modernizing its nuclear forces. For decades, it
appeared that China was not investing in a massive nuclear buildup
because its top political leaders believed that the country had other
more important priorities---especially at a time when China perceived no
immediate external threat. But that era is gone now.

THE CHANGED CALCULUS OF CHINESE LEADERS

Under its current leadership, China's continued rise is coupled with
growing disputes with Western countries over issues like human rights,
democratic values, rule of law, and international norms. These
developments have led Chinese leadership to conclude that China faces a
new geopolitical reality in which Western countries are deliberately
creating trouble and making up excuses to demonize and contain China,
fearing that the country's rise could challenge the West's dominance in
the international system. Believing that Western hostility is a result
of bigger structural changes in the international system, Beijing feels
the only solution is to further consolidate its own power until Western
countries acknowledge the new reality---that China's success and
strength are beyond doubt.

Fearing that any weakness would embolden Western countries to
destabilize China and threaten its regime's security, Chinese thought
leaders like Hu Xijin (the editor-in-chief of a major state-owned
tabloid) stress that it is critical for China to quickly build a much
larger nuclear arsenal. Hu argues that a bigger arsenal would make the
country's rivals respect China and exercise more self-restraint when
dealing with Beijing.

Hu by no means always represents official Chinese positions on specific
policy issues, but his reasoning seems to be striking a chord with the
general public. Much more importantly, this line of thinking may also
resonate with China's paramount leader, who has long stressed that China
should stand up against perceived Western aggression by showing
unequivocal strength and firm determination.

Indeed, shortly after coming to power in 2012, Chinese President Xi
Jinping emphasized the importance of the Second Artillery---the Chinese
military's missile branch, which was later upgraded to a full military
service and renamed the Rocket Force---as "a strategic pillar of China's
great power status." During an important national political meeting in
March 2021, he directed the military to "accelerate the construction of
advanced strategic deterrent" capabilities, which was the strongest and
most explicit public instruction on the topic to come from China's
highest-ranking leader. With the country's national decisionmaking power
increasingly concentrated in one person, the current paramount leader's
support for greater nuclear capabilities could go a long way to steer
China's nuclear development policy away from its traditional moderate
trajectory.

WHY BEIJING CARES ABOUT THE SIZE OF ITS ARSENAL

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union felt that keeping up with the
United States' nuclear arsenal was necessary for it to achieve real
political equality with Washington. Today, similar reasoning seems to be
behind China's nuclear buildup---a belief that the [United States won't
drop its hostility against China unless its hand is forced by robust
Chinese strategic power]{.underline}. So it seems likely that Beijing is
building up its permanent capabilities rather than planning to trade
them away as a bargaining chip anytime soon in future arms control
negotiations with Washington.

China's changing perceptions about its geopolitical environment come at
a time when decades of fast economic development are giving Chinese
leadership the ability to make vast investments in the country's nuclear
forces. For example, China in recent years procured a large number of
strategic nuclear submarines of its existing model, the 094 class,
instead of building a smaller number of them while the more advanced 096
class is still being developed.

This indicates that China has become more willing to invest in quantity,
in addition to its traditional focus on quality. Perhaps this is why
China wants to use its unique advantages in large-scale infrastructure
and industrial manufacturing to build up its silo-based nuclear
capabilities.

THE FUTURE OF U.S.-CHINA ARMS CONTROL

It appears less and less hopeful that the two countries can avoid a
nuclear arms race unless they can face and jointly examine their
fundamental disagreements---such as their severe geopolitical perception
gap. As Washington and Beijing talk past each other, they risk harboring
wrong assumptions about how the other party would use nuclear weapons in
future conflicts. If so, that will generate new tensions and threat
perceptions, risking a downward spiral in overall bilateral security
relations.

Unfortunately, these risks are not being adequately examined or
understood at all. The recent revelations of new Chinese missile silos
are rarely reported by Chinese media. Instead, the country's most
authoritative official media platforms---such as the People's Daily and
China Central Television---have dismissed the revelations by suggesting
that the United States is demonizing China and that the so-called
missile silos are actually windmills on a wind farm.

There has also been very little discussion about these new developments
among Chinese citizens, and more importantly, policy experts. Chinese
nuclear experts---who are supposed to contribute to policy debates and
deliberations---have so far remained almost completely silent. Most
experts do not seem to know what is going on and find it too sensitive
to even talk about or debate the new revelations. In fact, a number of
Chinese security experts have privately asked me whether the rumored
silos are actually windmills---and have seemed rather surprised to hear
my personal view that, perhaps, they are not. If facts are scarce and
ambiguous, experts in any country will struggle to give the
best-informed and most sound policy advice to their political leaders.

The scariest part of this great power competition is that in some places
it has led to stricter internal security regulations that greatly
discourage even domestic academic discussions on basic factual issues.
Direct, candid, and substantive exchanges between U.S. and Chinese
experts have also become much harder. As the two societies diverge, they
will face even greater challenges to building shared views on factual
issues, let alone policy matters.

**[MORE ESCALATION AHEAD]{.underline}**

At a recent public conference panel in China, a senior Chinese nuclear
expert made the following observation: when it comes to the nuclear
race, [the United States and China today are]{.underline} somewhat [like
the United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline} in the early 1960s.
This observation implies that the [two countries may be in the **early
stages** of a **long**, intense **nuclear arms race**.]{.underline} This
expert judged that it might take a major crisis---something of similar
severity to the Cuban Missile Crisis---to sober up political leaders
enough to make them reflect on the dangers of the current course.

The international community was lucky that the 1962 [Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline} did not become a massive nuclear exchange, which
could [have **destroyed humanity.** But luck is never guaranteed. **We
should not wait** to see whether another major missile crisis
will]{.underline} save us [or destroy us.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Hypersonics

#### Chinese [hypersonic]{.underline} development ensures [World War 3.]{.underline}

Brandon J **Weichert 21**, author of Winning Space: How America Remains
a Superpower, 10-18-2021, \"China's high-tech weapons out-fly America's
alliances,\"
<https://asiatimes.com/2021/10/chinas-high-tech-weapons-out-fly-americas-alliances/>,
cy

[Beijing]{.underline}, meanwhile, [has been undeterred by these Western
machinations.]{.underline}

Contrary to what Washington thinks, China's primary threat is economic
and technological. [Its military is **starting to achieve parity** with
the West in key areas]{.underline}. Yet the focus in China for
challenging the West continues to be all measures short of war.

While Washington spins its geopolitical wheels enhancing military
cooperation with Indo-Pacific powers, [Beijing continues to make **real
investments** in technological innovation that will **ensure** the
**future belongs to China** and not the United States.]{.underline}

Do you want a robust fifth-generation (5G) Internet architecture? Check
out Shenzhen. Interested in quantum Internet? Forget Silicon Valley; go
to Shanghai. Do you still think the US Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) is leading the world in exotic weapons
technology research and development? Well, in the case of hypersonic
weapons, you'll have to turn to Beijing rather than Washington.

In August, it was proved that China, not the United States, has a
hypersonic glide vehicle against which the American homeland has no
known defenses.

Scorpius was right: Showing strength is useless. Technological advances
give a great power strength.

Beijing has cracked the code to American greatness. China, after making
oodles of cash by being the world's sweatshop, has taken that money and
judiciously reinvested it into its high-tech R&D sectors. Like the
Americans of yesteryear, who told the world they'd get to the moon in a
decade with the purportedly limiting technologies of the late 1950s and
1960s, Red China has the guts to try new things.

None of America's desperate alliance building will mean much if China
enjoys a considerable lead in developing an arsenal of hypersonic
weapons against which the US military has no viable defense.

[**Imbalances** such as the one that China has displayed against the
Americans **in hypersonic technology** are how **world wars**
start.]{.underline}

[What is America's answer to the next-generation weaponry that China's
high-tech revolution is affording the People's Liberation Army (PLA)?
The controversial, hugely expensive F-35 Joint Strike Fighter? **What a
joke!** Or the **boondoggle** Zumwalt-class "stealth" warship that,
after decades of being in **Development Hell**, is finally being
mothballed? **What a waste!**]{.underline}

[Besides, China has not been deterred by America's alliance-building in
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. Instead, [Beijing has only gotten **more
frenetic** in its **investments** in **next-generation** high-tech
**R&D**.]{.underline} And while China's economy is slowing, its growth
rates are far better than those of the US.

### 2NC -- Lasers

#### China is on the brink of developing [super lasers]{.underline} -- they'll break the quantum vacuum [literally next year.]{.underline}

Dave **Makichuk 21**, veteran writer and copy-editor with 35 years\'
media experience, 5-12-2021, \"China on brink of laser-matter
breakthrough,\"
<https://asiatimes.com/2021/05/china-on-brink-of-laser-matter-breakthrough/>,
cy

Nuclear weapons have already shown that [it is possible to convert
matter into large amounts of heat and light, but doing it the other way
around, converting heat and light into matter, is much more difficult
--- but this is exactly **what laboratories in China**]{.underline} and
the UK [hope to achieve.]{.underline}

If the intended objective is reached, it could open up a whole a new
branch of physics, called nuclear photonics, full of technological
potentialities still unimaginable.

According to a report by Explica.co, [The **Station of Extreme Light**,
which China has been developing]{.underline} in Shanghai since 2018, has
[made significant progress in its goal of manufacturing **lasers** so
powerful **by 2023** that they could **break through empty space** and
create matter.]{.underline}

The Extreme Light Station (SEL) is a laser installation designed to
produce a laser with 100 petawatts (PW) of maximum power (one petawatt
equals one thousand trillion watts), a goal that is expected to be
achieved within two years.

[Once completed, the laser will be **the most powerful on Earth**, with
a power **10,000 times greater** than that of **all** the **electrical
networks** in the world combined and with an intensity **10 trillion
times greater** than that of **sunlight**, the report said.]{.underline}

The laser will be powerful enough to produce matter and antimatter
directly from the vacuum of space, allowing us to observe in a
terrestrial laboratory the same process that supposedly gave rise to the
universe.

This technology is based on the fact that [a vacuum is never really
empty: it is like a pond filled with pairs of electrons and
positrons]{.underline} (particles of matter and antimatter) that
occasionally emerge to the surface (existence), although they annihilate
each other as soon as they are formed.

A laser could intervene in that process and separate the matter and
antimatter particles before they collide, the report said.

You can then get both of them to emit gamma rays and generate more
electrons and positrons. That barrage of new particles and radiation
could be detected when it acquires sufficient density.

[The laser would have thus succeeded in creating particles and
antiparticles as if they had arisen out of nowhere: it would demonstrate
that light can **pull particles** of matter and **antimatter** out of
**empty space**, a phenomenon known as **"breaking the
vacuum."**]{.underline}

#### That [erases]{.underline} all hope for [life]{.underline} in the universe.

Sebastian **Kettley 21**, 6-29-2021, \"\'Bubble of doom\' Cosmologist
explains vacuum decay,\"
<https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1455722/vacuum-decay-of-universe-katie-mack-end-of-the-world-cosmic-death-bubble-evg>,
cy

[The Universe is going to end]{.underline} one day, that much is
certain, though scientists still argue over how it will happen. One
theory suggests the world will end in \"heat death\" - a state in which
the Universe becomes too cold to sustain life. Other hypothetical models
predict the Universe will literally tear itself apart at the subatomic
level in the \"Big Rip\", driven by dark energy and the expansion of
space.

Another interesting theory about the end of the world has been given
some credence in recent years after physicists discovered the elementary
Higgs Boson particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in 2012.

This new model is known as the [**\"vacuum decay\"** of the Universe,
although it is also sometimes called the **\"Cosmic Death
Bubble\".**]{.underline}

According to this hypothetical scenario, [there is an instability in
the]{.underline} so-called [Higgs Field, which **stretches** across
**the entire Universe.**]{.underline}

Scientists believe [the Higgs Field together with the Higgs Boson
interacts with other particles, like electrons or quarks, to give them
mass.]{.underline}

And [if something were to go wrong with this field]{.underline}, some
scientists predict [the results would be **absolutely catastrophic** for
the Universe.]{.underline}

[Cosmologist Katie Mack]{.underline} described this hypothetical
scenario on the FQXi podcast last week where she appeared to promote her
book, The End of Everything (Astrophysically speaking).

The book covers all the different ways in which scientists today believe
the Universe could end.

Dr Mack said: [\"Vacuum decay is]{.underline} in some sense [the most
humane of the ways that the Universe could go out]{.underline} because
you would not see it coming so you don\'t have to be scared of it, you
wouldn\'t feel it happen to you and there would be no tragic aftermath.
**[Everything would just be done.]{.underline}**

\"The idea behind vacuum decay is that it seems that there\'s some
possibility that the Higgs Field - this kind of energy field that
pervades all of space, that\'s connected to the Higgs Boson to this set
up of rules of particle physics - it\'s possible that this Higgs Field
is not entirely stable.\"

[If **the Higgs Field** truly is unstable, then the field\'s value
**could change** in some part of the Universe.]{.underline}

[If this ever happened, the change would propagate outwards at the speed
of light in what Dr Mack described as a \"bubble of doom\".]{.underline}

[**This bubble** would **completely change** and **rearrange** the
Universe as we know it, spelling **certain doom for all
life.**]{.underline}

The expert explained: \"[As it propagates outward and as it collides
with things it would put everything into a kind of space where the laws
of physics are different, particles don\'t hold together
anymore]{.underline}, maybe [everything inside of the bubble collapses
into a black hole.]{.underline}

\"It\'s a real big mess and so it\'s an idea that\'s been around for a
while, that there\'s a possibility our Higgs vacuum is not stable. It\'s
so-called metastable.

\"The idea is that there are different vacuum states possible, where a
vacuum state is just the term for, like, the rules of physics in our
Universe and those are kind of determined by the Higgs Field.

\"And so, if the Higgs Field has a different value in a different vacuum
state, we have different rules of the Universe.\"

If we are living inside of what is called a false vacuum, where it\'s
not the Universe\'s prefered energy state, then scientists speculate
this could occur.

You would see a transition into a \"true vacuum\" where Dr Mack said
\"the laws of physics are all different and we all die\".

Dr Mack added: \"Technically speaking, if it\'s going to happen, it
could happen at any time and that\'s one of the things that make it an
interesting thing to think about.

\"It could be [this sort of **bubble of doom** that forms somewhere in
space and **destroys us all**.\"]{.underline}

But the good news is the chances of this ever happening, if at all, are
so slim they are virtually nonexistent.

Some scientists estimate it would take another 20 to 30 billion years
for this to happen - about two times more than the present age of the
Universe.

### 2NC -- Strategic Stability

#### They're on the *cusp* of second-strike capabilities -- it's [now or never!]{.underline}

John A. **Tirpak 21**, Editorial Director of Air Force Magazine,
11-3-2021, \"China's Nuclear Development Outstrips Predictions; 1,000
Warheads by 2030,\"
<https://www.airforcemag.com/chinas-nuclear-development-outstrips-predictions-1000-warheads-by-2030/>,
cy

[China is building new nuclear weapons much faster than previously
predicted, already has a **"nascent nuclear triad,"** and will field
more than 1,000 nuclear warheads **by 2030**, according to the
Pentagon's 2021]{.underline} report on China's military power, released
Nov. 3.

According to a Pentagon briefing paper highlighting changes from the
2020 edition of the report, "the accelerating pace of the \[People's
Republic of China's\] nuclear expansion may enable \[it\] to have up to
[700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027]{.underline}, ... \[and\] at
least 1,000 warheads by 2030, exceeding the pace and size" that the
Defense Department previously projected. [China is also shifting to a
**"launch on warning"** posture for its nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

In its last report, the Pentagon said China had 200 nuclear warheads and
was expected to double that number by the end of the decade, indicating
nearly a trebling of its deployment pace in the coming years. Moreover,
the new document only captures developments up to December 2020, and its
2021 release was about two months late, the Pentagon said. The pace may
have accelerated even further since.

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, speaking at AFA's Air, Space & Cyber
Conference in September, foreshadowed the report, saying that, in his
view, [China is "developing a first-strike capability."]{.underline}

[The Pentagon was not as alarming, saying **China's plan** for now is to
develop a **"credible second-strike"** capacity with nuclear weapons,
meaning **enough could survive** a first strike by the U.S. to retaliate
with "**multiple rounds of counterstrike**]{.underline}, deterring an
adversary with the threat of unacceptable damage."

Even at 1,000 nuclear weapons, though, China will not have achieved
parity with the U.S. in terms of warheads, according to a senior defense
official who briefed reporters ahead of the report's release.

According to a State Department disclosure in early October, the U.S.
has 3,750 nuclear warheads, down from 3,805 a year earlier and 3,822 in
2018. The U.S. inventory has declined due to the decay of the warheads'
plutonium cores and a replacement pace that doesn't keep up with
retirements.

The Pentagon said the People's Liberation Army Rocket Forces are
developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles that will
"significantly improve" their overall force, and they will be equipped
with multiple independently targeted warheads, necessitating an increase
in warhead production.

[China is expanding its "capacity to produce and **separate plutonium**
by constructing faster breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities,"
the report said.]{.underline}

[The PLARF "has commenced building at least three new solid-fueled ICBM
silo fields, which will cumulatively contain **hundreds** of **new ICBM
silos**]{.underline}," the report noted. Concurrently, [China is
expanding its inventory of road-mobile DF-26 intermediate-range
ballistic missiles, which can strike ground or maritime
targets]{.underline}, and in 2020, fielded ["its first hypersonic
weapons system, the DF-17 hypersonic glide vehicle-capable medium-range
ballistic missile."]{.underline}

In August, China tested a globe-circling hypersonic weapon, which may
have been the DF-17.

China has also built up its H-8 bomber force, adding a "nuclear
air-launched ballistic missile," effectively establishing China's own
version of a triad, along with intercontinental ballistic missiles and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles.

[The PRC also plans to "increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear
forces by moving to a **launch-on-warning** (LOW) **posture** with an
expanded silo-based force,"]{.underline} the paper said.

There "clearly has been a change" in China's approach to nuclear
weapons, the defense official said. [Besides **diversifying its nuclear
arsenal**, China is also expanding the underlying infrastructure needed
to make warheads and connect its weapons with a **command and control**
network]{.underline}, he said.

"The nuclear expansion the PRC is undertaking is certainly very
concerning to us," the official asserted. It "raises some questions ...
They haven't really explained why they're doing it, \[and\] ... we'd
like to have more insight into their intentions."

Compared to China's historic stockpiles, "they're moving in a direction
that substantially exceeds where they've been before in numbers and
capabilities," the official said. This "reinforces the importance of
pursuing some practical measures for risk reduction." While China has a
"no first use" of nuclear weapons policy, it is "suggesting in some of
their professional military writings that maybe that wouldn't apply" in
all circumstances, the official said. Given that, and the shift to a
launch-on-warning posture, "That just makes it more important that
responsible powers that seek those capabilities ... need to have
discussions with each other," he said.

The official declined to say more because the Nuclear Posture Review is
ongoing, and the issue of China's growing nuclear force will be dealt
with in the resulting document.

The U.S. has urged China in recent years to participate in joint
strategic arms talks with the U.S. and Russia, but China has declined,
saying it is not interested. China is signatory to no nuclear arms
agreements or protocols.

The report said China fields about 100 ICBMs in different basing modes,
including roll-out and road-mobile missiles. It "appears to be doubling
the numbers of launchers in some ICBM units." The PLA is developing a
"DF-5C and may be developing a DF-32 ICBM."

China's nuclear missile submarine fleet includes six boats, each of
which can carry 12 CSS-N-14 (JL-2) sea-launched ballistic missiles. [The
next generation of **SSBN submarine** likely goes into **production**
"in the **early 2020s**." The new model will likely also have **upgraded
missiles.**]{.underline}

The People's Liberation Army Air Forces have operationally fielded the
H-6N bomber---a derivative of Russia's Tu-16 Badger bomber---"providing
a platform for the air component" of China's nascent triad. The H-6N
force is developing tactics and the aircraft is equipped with an
air-refueling probe. [It also has a recessed space in the fuselage
likely meant "for external carriage of an ALBM believed to be nuclear
capable."]{.underline}

The H-6N can carry six land-attack cruise missiles with a range allowing
it to hit targets "in the second island chain" from airfields in the
mainland. The H-6K is being equipped with YJ-12 anti-ship cruise
missiles to hit targets in the same range, "significantly extending" the
Chinese Navy's reach.

[The PLAAF "is also developing new medium- and **long-range stealth
bombers** to strike regional and **global targets**,]{.underline}" the
report said. While this was publicly announced in 2016, "it may take
more than a decade to develop this type of advanced bomber," the
Pentagon said.

#### Waiting causes a Chinese [race to parity]{.underline} -- that collapses [strategic stability]{.underline} and east Asian [alliances]{.underline}

First, while the common estimate of China's nuclear weapons is
approximately three hundred, due to China's lack of transparency, it is
possible that China has significantly more than this estimate. [This
month, there have been calls within China for expanding its nuclear
arsenal to one thousand strategic warheads]{.underline}, to say nothing
of nuclear weapons on intermediate-range or other forces. While the
United States has taken a "strategic holiday," the People's Republic of
China (PRC) has used the opportunity to expand their arsenals, as well
as cyber and conventional capabilities. When one reflects upon the
considerable effort to create strategic systems, as well as cyber and
conventional capabilities, inescapable conclusions are, first, that the
causes of their expansion is rooted in their own grand strategic
objectives of achieving hegemony and, second, the decision to expand
their forces was sown long ago. China has used our strategic passivity
to expand.  What Reagan's Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger said in
the Soviet context remains true today: [\"When we build, they build,
when we stop, they build."  The growth of Chinese arsenals cannot be
divorced from other evidence of China's expansion.]{.underline} They are
expanding their bases, for example, in Djibouti and Gwadar, and alliance
networks including through the Belt and Road Initiative and "debt
diplomacy," the creation of new international institutions to supplant
extant ones, and aggressive intelligence operations. [ These measures
indicate that China is a non-status quo great power but is a
revisionist---and one that seeks change immediately. This bodes ill for
strategic stability. Most concerning is that China's build-up might
allow it to race to parity or superiority with the United States, which
would result in an intense arms race. China's actions make it a threat
to strategic stability]{.underline}. To maintain strategic stability
requires modernizing U.S. strategic systems, including missile defenses,
and conventional capabilities. [ Not to do so invites a direct and
existential strategic challenge to the security of our allies and
ourselves.]{.underline} Second, the form of China's build-up is notable.
Always secretive, the Chinese have occluded their nuclear expansion as
they do not want to provoke a premature reaction from the United States
or its allies. More damning is that the Chinese are secretly "preparing
the battlefield" to ensure that they have the ability to damage the
United States through other, nonnuclear, means. These nonnuclear avenues
of attack include cyber, control of space, supply chain dominance,
economic influence, technological mastery of 5G and increasingly
artificial intelligence, soft power, and the continued legal and illegal
access to America's knowledge, intellectual property, finance, and
technology to facilitate Beijing's growth. This would ensure the United
States could be damaged sufficiently---in effect, a near equivalent of a
major nuclear attack---to cause U.S. political leaders to yield in a
crisis or limited war without the employment of nuclear weapons. China
might launch one or more cyber attacks on the electrical grid and on the
ability of the United States to recover and rebuild its electrical grid
after a significant cyber attack. This is likely to be a direct attack
in the cyber realm but the damage might also be inadvertent due to the
unintended consequences of an attack against another target. Moreover,
the risks of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) to the U.S. electrical grid is
also a possibility. The vulnerability of America electricity to
EMP---whether from deliberate EMP attack, cyber attack, or solar
activity---and the ability to recover the electrical grid in the wake of
an event is an issue that must be solved now.  Third, China rejects arms
control in practice and in principle. Thus far, [Beijing will not
unilaterally reduce or limit its arsenal or enter into arms control
talks]{.underline}. That is a worrisome sign and suggests that U.S.
assumptions about the causes of stability in a great power relationship
are only its own, and not shared by China. A major objective of arms
control is that it can promote stability in the relations between
states. The state willingly abandons or limits a class of weapons to
demonstrate to other actors that its ambitions are limited and it
supports strategic stability. By entering an arms control regime, China
could show that it accepts the value of arms control and seeks
confidence-building measures, which aids stability while demonstrating
that China is a status quo power. Fundamentally, it would allow China to
signal its peaceful intentions, and, in turn, have an important
stabilizing effect on states concerned with China's increasing power.
[The fact that China rejects arms control is troubling and suggests,
first, it is a revisionist power, and second, that it wants to be
unfettered as it expands its arsenal.]{.underline} [These developments
mean that strategic stability is unlikely to obtain. China is likely to
race for superiority, and that is destabilizing, and the United States
must ensure this never occurs and must prepare itself for the return of
an arms race]{.underline}. Given the PRC's unprecedented expansion, the
United States must respond by modernizing its capabilities to deter them
from threatening the homeland, U.S. military, and its alliance
commitments. [These are critical steps to deter them from the temptation
to race to parity or superiority, which could result in the collapse of
U.S. credibility and alliances]{.underline}. Lastly, the United States
must ensure that its vulnerability to non-nuclear forms of major
economic and societal damage to the U.S. homeland is addressed.

[[China's]{.mark} **Persistent Illiberalism** and [**Tensions** with the
LIO]{.mark}]{.underline}

[How do the domestic politics of an authoritarian state such as the
**PRC affect**]{.underline} whether it seeks to engage or reshape [the
**international order**]{.underline} as it grows in power and influence?
Do the CCP's ambitions extend beyond changing "the distribution of
authority and rights" to challenging the "underlying principles of
liberal order," as Ikenberry asks?28 At a basic level, the PRC is likely
to follow the United States in privileging its own domestic interests
and relative power within the global hierarchy.29 Yet the PRC is
undeniably different from the United States in a number of ways that put
it at odds with core principles of the LIO.30 On the one hand, the PRC
has been a staunch defender of Westphalian principles of respect for
territorial sovereignty as well as the UN charter, the principle of
non-intervention, and the present configuration of the UN Security
Council (UNSC). The PRC also helped shape, and ultimately signed on to,
a more narrow conception of the "Responsibility To Protect" (R2P)
principle authorizing international intervention to prevent genocide and
crimes against humanity.31 On the other hand, four characteristics of
contemporary CCP rule are at odds with the LIO as a rules-based order
that privileges democracy, free enterprise, and individual political
freedoms.

First, [the [CCP has emphasized]{.mark} the]{.underline} role of the
[[state over **private enterprise**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though it
was the [**introduction** of [markets]{.mark} and **economic
liberalization** after Mao's death]{.underline} that
[[unleashed]{.underline}]{.mark} China's economic miracle. China's brand
of **[[state capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** ---including subsidies,
nonmarket barriers, and other preferential policies that have curtailed
reciprocal market access---[[has been responsible for]{.mark} much of
the **international [backlash]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} China's
**[trade]{.mark} practices**]{.underline} and participation in the WTO.
[[China has]{.mark} also [made **financial**]{.mark}]{.underline},
technical, and infrastructural [[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}
available [[to governments that do not meet]{.mark} the liberal
**political** and **economic** [conditions]{.mark} set by **traditional
lenders**.32]{.underline}

Second, [the [CCP]{.mark} has [opposed]{.mark} the **elevation** of
individual **[political]{.mark} rights**]{.underline} and has regarded
civil society organizations and transnational nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and activists with suspicion, fearing that they
might challenge the CCP's domestic rule. In opposing the 1997 [**Ottawa
Treaty** banning land mines]{.underline}, for example, the [Chinese
[government viewed the]{.mark} involvement of NGOs in the negotiation of
a **key [document]{.mark}** [with **distrust**]{.mark}]{.underline}.33
In the development arena, Chinese loans and grants have also sought to
enhance state capacity. As one study of China's information and
communications technology (ICT) investments in Africa noted, other
donors typically select the most appropriate actors to advance a
particular development objective, "be it a local NGO, a private company,
or a specific ministry," whereas China "has preferred an actor-based
approach, seeking to increase the capacity of the state"---including the
installation of AI-powered surveillance systems.34

Third, the [CCP has demonstrated a **clear preference** for "rule by law
rule of law." Laws" over "]{.underline}in China [have **proliferated**,
but the CCP has **redoubled** its **commitment** to using the law to
carry out its objectives]{.underline} rather than allowing the law to
constrain its discretion.35 On 30 June 2020, following a months-long
standoff with a broadly popular movement for the defense of Hong Kong's
freedoms, the PRC National People's Congress passed a national security
law penalizing secession, subversion, organization and perpetration of
terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign actors, including acts
committed by anyone, anywhere in the world. By operating above the Basic
Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the National Security Law has been
widely regarded as ending the "one country, two systems" model that was
expected to provide Hong Kong with a "high degree of autonomy" until
2047.36 In response to British accusations that China had violated its
commitments under the 1984 Joint Declaration, Chinese Ambassador Liu
Xiaoming insisted that China has always upheld its international
obligations and that "the copyright of 'one country, two systems'
belongs to Chinese former leader Deng Xiaoping, not the Sino-British
Joint Declaration."37 As developments in Hong Kong show, the CCP's
willingness to refine and reinterpret its legal commitments indicates
that it is unlikely that the CCP will rely heavily on rule-based
restraints to legitimize its international leadership.

Fourth, the [[CCP has promoted a more **ethno-nationalist**
vision]{.underline}]{.mark} of its rule:
[[suppressing]{.underline}]{.mark} expressions of ethnic and [[religious
identity]{.underline}]{.mark} with foreign ties, particularly [**Islam**
and **Christianity**,]{.underline} and appealing to foreign citizens of
Chinese descent to love the motherland. This [[turn toward]{.mark}
**ethnic [nativism]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than civic nationalism
[**raises** concerns about the CCP's willingness to tolerate
**individual differences**]{.underline} and identities38 and respect
foreign governments' sovereignty over their putative citizens. And it
feeds doubts that a hegemonic China will want to preserve an
interconnected world in which international actors and ideas have
opportunities to "penetrate" the leading state and shape its choices in
ways that render them more acceptable to other states.39

[These attributes suggest that the [CCP's interests]{.mark}
**fundamentally** [conflict with]{.mark}]{.underline} the more demanding
components of [**political [liberalism]{.mark}**, particularly the
**elevation** of individual political rights]{.underline} above state
sovereignty. That said, the leaders of post-Mao China have not sought to
export a universal ideology or form of government, avoiding an
irreconcilable conflict between China's rise and the defense of
democracy.40 [As for **economic liberalism**, there are **greater
[tensions]{.mark}** [between **China's** state-led]{.mark} mode of
**authoritarian [capitalism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
first form of **[economic [liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, premised
on unfettered domestic markets, free trade between countries, and few
constraints on international capital and foreign investment. But a form
of re-"embedded" liberalism in which states have discretion to cushion
the impacts of free trade could be more compatible with the CCP's desire
for a stronger state role in the economy.41 Finally, [[with regard
to]{.mark} **liberal
institutionalism**---[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} via principled
multilateralism---China has had a mixed record, [[working within]{.mark}
some [institutions to advance its interests]{.mark} (the **W**orld
**B**ank, International Monetary Fund \[**IMF**\], **UNSC**, **WTO**,
for example]{.underline}) [while flouting others]{.underline} (including
the rejection of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
\[ITLOS\] ruling on the South China Sea).42 The CCP's preference for
bilateral negotiations over multilateralism suggests that although China
may become an increasingly ambitious stakeholder within existing
institutions, its major new international initiatives, such as the Belt
and Road Initiative, are unlikely to take the form of self-binding
multilateral agreements that limit sovereign discretion.43

#### China is joining [international initiatives]{.underline} to destroy the order them [from the inside]{.underline}.

order from within,\"
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-overturning-rules-based-order-within,
sg

Persistent debates over the meaning of the "[**liberal**" or
"**rules-based**" international order demonstrate a point of
**agreement** among **scholars**]{.underline} and policymakers: the real
power of the concept when employed as a metaphor for a disrupted global
order.

Less well understood in comparison is the architecture of the order as a
hierarchy of rules, with the most authoritative and determinate being
the rules of international law at its foundation. That [[**structure**
demonstrates the flaw in]{.mark} **frequent [reassurances]{.mark}**
[that **China**]{.mark}**'s** contestation of **basic rules** of
international law [shows a **commitment** to work]{.mark}]{.underline}
within [rather than "overturn" [the order]{.mark}.]{.underline} By
subverting the meaning of the most foundational rules on which the order
is based, China may already be overturning the order from within.

In a recent Lowy Institute analysis, Bobo Lo argues that the "concept of
a 'rules-based international order' has become increasingly devoid of
substance". The lack of precision as a term of art is unsurprising, with
the concept emerging from a forensic construction of hegemonic and
therefore previously unstated understandings of global rules,
institutions and conventions.

There was little need to name and categorise what was distinctive about
global order in the immediate post--Cold War years, when the singularity
and longevity of the US-led order seemed to be among its defining
features. Moreover, competing formulations of the rules-based order
replicate the real forces of shifting geopolitical power and contested
liberal values that necessitate interrogation of global and legal order
in the first place.

A point of agreement among policymakers is nevertheless evident in
recurrent descriptions of "the rules-based international order,
including international law and non-binding norms of state of
behaviour". Yet these accounts rarely if ever explain the significance
of distinguishing between legal and merely political norms.

The principles expressed by [[China would refashion law]{.mark} as a
tool [for]{.mark} **imperial [power]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is
inconsistent with any notion of the rules-based order.

The structure of the rules-based order should be thought of as
concentric circles of increasingly more authoritative and determinate
rules. On the outside are political statements of intent, such as the
[proposed **Code of Conduct** between China and members of the
**Association of Southeast Asian Nations** to manage disputes in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea.
[The explicitly **non-legal** character]{.underline} of the agreement
[facilitates **cooperation**]{.underline} among parties by lowering the
political stakes, but thereby also has neither the binding force of a
treaty, nor remedies for a "breach" beyond mere diplomatic protests.

At the core of the rule-based order, in contrast, are treaties and
customary rules of international law that meet the stringent criteria
states have agreed on to demonstrate consent to be legally bound. These
most [authoritative rules create a range of state
responsibilities]{.underline}, which often include submitting disputes
to international courts and tribunals. The Philippines did so
successfully in the South China Sea Arbitration by exercising rights
enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

More significantly, these [[rules anchor the **entire**]{.mark}
**rules-based [order]{.mark}** [by defining the keystone]{.mark} of
state [sovereignty]{.mark} and associated powers of rule
creation]{.underline}. There are thus real consequences to knowing what
are core legal rules properly so-called and what are dependent political
norms.

It is here that we can understand the danger in reading [[China's
**challenge** to]{.mark} the [**interpretation** and **meaning**
of]{.mark} **fundamental [principles]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
international law as support for the order. Lo repeats the claim that
there is no evidence of China's intent "to overturn the global order and
impose in its place a Chinese Brave New World". Ben Scott, Director of
the Lowy Institute's "Australia's Security and the Rules-Based Order"
project, appears to agree that China's goal is "to refashion rather than
overturn the old order". Finally, John Ikenberry argues that, due in
part to the burden of creating new rules and institutions, even if China
aspires to "undermine and replace the existing liberal international
order, the constraints on doing so are overwhelming".

Certainly China is not driven by any design to conspicuously rebrand in
its own image the global architecture of the UN system, World Trade
Organisation rules, or international law itself. Moreover, there is
significant agreement among commentators that a rising China's desire
for a commensurately greater role in global governance should, in many
cases, be accommodated within existing rules and institutions.

Yet, the distinction between overtly overthrowing the order and
upholding the formal structure of global institutions, while divesting
them of underlying values and constraints on power, is largely one
without a difference.

[Nationalistic]{.underline} Chinese [[**interpretations** of the
**UN**]{.mark} **[C]{.mark}**onvention on the **[L]{.mark}**aw
**[o]{.mark}**f the **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline} -- the "constitution
of the oceans" -- [[are now so incompatible with any]{.mark}
**recognised [understanding]{.mark}** of the law t[hat they pose a
threat to the very meaning o]{.mark}f **state
[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline} and thus to the order itself.
Self[-judging edicts extend not only to specific UNCLOS rules, but to
the [attempted **subordination** of]{.mark} **multilateral
[treaties]{.mark}** to]{.underline} unilateral declarations of "historic
rights" in the South China Sea that are unknown to the law. The
[principles expressed by China would refashion law as a tool for
**imperial power** that is **inconsistent** with any **notion** of the
**rules-based order**]{.underline}. The systemic implications are
perhaps finally being recognised, with the US recently announcing the
reversal of "eight years of cheek-turning with respect to international
law in the South China Sea".

[China's **rhetorical [deference]{.mark}** [to **international law**
masks the more **subversive consequence** of its
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}: redrawing the boundaries between law and
politics in a way that overturns foundational parts of the global order
from within. The [future viability of **international law's authority**
will lie with the fate of the **rules-based order**,]{.underline} which
will set the structure of power within which legally binding rules can
operate.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[liberal world
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which came into being at the end of World
War II under American leadership, [[has been]{.mark} going
[through]{.mark} a **radical [transformation]{.mark}** in recent years
mostly [owing to China\'s]{.mark} spectacular
[rise]{.mark}.]{.underline} In parallel to its increasing material power
capability, [[China is]{.mark} also [posing]{.mark} fundamental
[challenges to the]{.mark} **normative [fabric]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark}
liberal [world]{.mark} order.]{.underline}

What are the key characteristics of China\'s challenge to the liberal
world order and whether the growing confrontation between the
established hegemon, the United States, and the aspiring hegemon, China,
will result in the global Armageddon requires serious attention.

For long, U.S.-led international organizations have not only enabled
Western actors to materialize their interests across the globe but also
perpetuate the core liberal assumption that there is only one route to
modernity and development, i.e., the Western way.

Acting as the gatekeepers to the Western international community, such
international organizations have long played key roles in the
socialization of erstwhile non-Western states into constitutive norms,
rules and values of the Western world.

The hope for transformation

Since its opening up to the world economy in the late 1970s, Western
powers hoped that China would gradually transform into a responsible
stakeholder of the liberal international order and adopt its core
values, such as consolidation and promotion of the principles of
individual entrepreneurship, democratic way of government, minimum state
involvement in the economy, rule of law, free trade, the secularization
of societal relations and respect for multiculturalism.

The main reason of such optimism was that China benefited from becoming
a part of the capitalist world economy and its double-digit economic
development was long made possible by its economic interaction with the
U.S.

However, it is now the case that China\'s adoption of capitalist
practices has not paved the way for its liberal democratic
transformation and the U.S., under the Obama and Trump administrations,
have begun defining China as a strategic rival that needs to be
contained. Looking from the American perspective, the \"strategy of
engagement\" has now given way to a \"strategy of containment.\"

At stake now is whether China\'s evolving approach to liberal
international order justifies a radical change in the American approach
toward China, away from engagement to containment. At closer inspection,
it seems that the maintenance of regional and global stability is still
in China\'s national interests. As of today, particularly given the
protectionist trade war that President Trump has waged on China and
China\'s galloping internal challenges, Beijing is not in a position to
risk the gains of its ongoing development process by adopting a hardline
approach toward the United States and its neighbors.

China has the largest reserves in U.S. dollars and its access to the
American market, technology and foreign direct investment is still
important for its economic modernization. China does not have the luxury
of postponing its transformation into an economy in which Chinese
companies produce mainly technology-intensive high value-added goods and
domestic consumption increases to such an extent that China\'s economic
development is not negatively affected by recessions and contractions in
developed Western economies.

The Chinese economy cannot survive long on the principles of export-led
growth and high domestic savings. Besides, an aggressive stance against
its neighbors will likely push them further closer to the arms of the
United States, thereby tarnishing Chinese attempts at manufacturing soft
power.

How to gain a role

China owes its meteoric rise in global politics to its efforts to become
a part of the capitalist world economy. Its influence in global politics
arises from the intense economic relationships it has developed with
many other countries.

China has now become the number one trading-partner of not only its
neighbors to the south and east but also many developed countries in the
West. China is still the global factory of merchandise goods and it
needs to import many raw materials from abroad because it is a
resource-poor country.

If China wants to benefit from its growing economic relations with other
countries, such as through the Belt and Road Imitative (BRI), the
message that Chinese leaders have long been giving should continue to
resonate: China\'s rise also means the rise of others. For China\'s
\"no-strings-attached\" development aid policy not to be seen imperial,
China\'s economic rise should continue benefiting others as well. The
improvement of infrastructural capacities of the countries on which
China is dependent on for raw materials and to which China exports goods
are in the final analysis in China\'s national economic interests.

An important characteristic of China\'s rise also relates to its
continental size and huge population. Because size matters in
international politics, every small increase in Chinese per capita
income will lift many Chinese people out of poverty and increase
China\'s share in the global economy.

Despite the fact the per capita income in China is still less than
\$10,000, China will likely overtake the United States as the largest
economy by no later than the mid-century. Any war with the United States
will certainly postpone this to much later.

Challenge to liberal order

[[China\'s challenge]{.mark} to the **liberal world order** closely
[varies with its]{.mark} civilizational state
[identity]{.mark}]{.underline} and core values of Chinese society, such
as a father-like status of the state in the eyes of people, [**unitary
state identity**, **territorial [integrity]{.mark}**, realpolitik
**security [culture]{.mark}**, societal **[cohesion]{.mark}**, primacy
of **family bonds** [over individuality,]{.mark} primacy of state
sovereignty over popular sovereignty, [state\'s]{.mark} unquestioned
[involvement in]{.mark} **economics** and **social
[life]{.mark}**]{.underline}, primacy of responsible and ethical
statesmanship over electoral legitimacy[, resolving conflicts through
**societal mechanisms**]{.underline} and trust relationships rather than
legal instruments, primacy of hierarchical relations within the society
over egalitarianism and primacy of shame culture over guilt culture.

Another [key characteristic of China\'s rise is that despite all
**counter allegations** that [Chinese]{.mark} foreign [policy has turned
out to bec]{.mark}ome more **assertive** and
**[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the last decade Chinese
leaders seem to have been following a low key foreign policy orientation
by avoiding rigid positions on global issues unless core national
interests are at stake, such as the status of Taiwan, Tibet, the Uighur
region, the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

[Chinese [leaders]{.mark} also [avoid]{.mark} **taking global
[responsibilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is a [challenge mainly
because the costs of maintaining global stability]{.underline} and
providing global commons will dramatically increase absent the Chinese
contribution. On the other hand, such a reluctant approach to global
governance might suggest that China is not resolved to replace the
United States as the global hegemon.

[[China is]{.underline}]{.mark} not openly [questioning the established
**Western liberal order** by either [forming anti-Western
coalition]{.mark}]{.underline}s of states or doing its best to make sure
that Western-led international organizations do not operate smoothly.

It is for sure that China, along with many other rising powers, wants to
see that its growing ascendance in global politics be accommodated
institutionally and peacefully. However, should Western powers decline
to accommodate [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, the latter [[will]{.mark}
not hesitate to help [establish alternative]{.mark} **institutional
[platforms]{.mark}** under its guidance, such as the **Asia
Infrastructure and Investment Bank** and the **Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership**. China values external
**democratization**]{.underline} of global politics rather than internal
democratization of national politics.

The project goal

Today\'s [China is not pursuing a strategy of **global
hegemony**]{.underline}. Defining their empire-state as the Middle
Kingdom, [Chinese rulers have never adopted an **imperial mission**
whose **essential logic** was to help transform others in **China\'s
image**]{.underline}. Despite that they believed in the superiority of
their civilization, Chinese rulers have never engaged in an
empire-building project whose goal was to bring civilization to
barbarians.

The **[expectation]{.underline}** was that others [would at some time in
the future accept and respect the legitimacy of **China\'s primacy** and
pay their tributes to Beijing]{.underline} in return for Chinese
benevolence and rewarding economic relations. Embracing a benign
imperial mindset, [**today\'s rulers** of China want to make sure that a
**decentralized imperial**]{.underline} order take place, first in East
and Southeast Asia, in which China sits at the center and other states
respect the superiority of Chinese values as well as China\'s centrality
in their development.

[[China is against the idea of]{.mark} a **universal
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well as the practices of setting
global standards of human rights. [[From the Chinese
**perspective**]{.mark}, **rules**, **values** and [**norms** are
relative]{.mark} and products of different time and **space
configurations**]{.underline}. Similar to other great powers, China
hopes that its values and norms are shared by others. However, it does
not construct its foreign relations on the basis of a normative
understating in that it is China\'s historical and civilizational
mission to project its values abroad.

On the contrary, [**Chinese [leaders]{.mark}** [appear to believe
that]{.mark} the **main [features]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} Chinese
**civilizations** have already shaped the **dynamics** of **interstate**
and **transnational relations**]{.underline} in East and Southeast Asia
and that the more interdependent economic and strategic relations China
builds with its neighbors, within the framework of realist Westphalian
order, [the more [leverage **Beijing** will have over other
**capitals**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Miracle: The Epic Story of Asia's Quest for Wealth*, 12/9/2021,
\"China Wants to Rule the World by Controlling the Rules,\"
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/12/china-wants-rule-world-controlling-rules/620890/,
sg

[In the **U.S**. and much of the **liberal West**]{.underline}, the
concept of the "[[**rule of law**" is vital to a properly]{.mark}
functioning [society]{.mark}]{.underline}---the idea (at least in
theory) that the [[law is **impartial**]{.underline}]{.mark},
independent, [[and applied evenly]{.underline}]{.mark} and consistently
to all, and that it serves to protect the innocent, including from the
state. [China's leaders]{.underline}, however, [follow the concept of
the "**[rule by law]{.mark}**," in which the legal system is a tool
[used to assure **Communist** ]{.mark}**Party** [dominance]{.mark};
[courts are forums for]{.mark} imposing [the **government's
will**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The state can do just about anything it
wants, and then find some helpful language in the "laws" to justify it.

[To see these **differing perspectives**]{.underline} in action,
[consider the case of Meng Wanzhou]{.underline}, the chief [financial
officer of]{.underline} the Chinese telecom giant
**[Huawei]{.underline}** Technologies, [who was arrested]{.underline} in
Vancouver in late 2018 on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department, [which
indicted her for **bank fraud**.]{.underline} From the American point of
view, the case was a matter of law enforcement: The Justice Department
accused Meng of lying to a major international bank about Huawei's
business in Iran, causing financial transactions that violated
Washington's sanctions on that country. Prosecutors were vindicated when
Meng confirmed the substance of the case in an agreement reached in
September that allowed her to avoid a U.S. trial and return to China.

[In **Beijing**]{.underline}, however, [the case was]{.underline} never
[perceived as]{.underline} anything but **[political]{.underline}**.
China's Foreign [Ministry deemed Meng's indictment]{.underline} "a
political frame-up ... designed to hobble Chinese high-tech." Thus for
Beijing, the case demanded a political solution. In July, when U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with her Chinese
counterparts, they handed her two lists of demands that included
dropping the case against Meng. Her eventual release was heralded within
China as a diplomatic triumph. (Huawei, in a comment attributed to
Meng's lawyer, William W. Taylor, noted that she did not plead guilty,
and asserted that "we fully expect the indictment will be dismissed.")

In a narrow sense, the [episode illustrates **rival
[superpowers]{.mark}** [seeking to pressure each
other]{.mark}]{.underline}, just one [[part of]{.mark} [a wider]{.mark}
**global [conflagration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet this view misses the
larger lesson of the case. Meng's arrest and subsequent release point to
something far deeper and longer-lasting, with the potential to reshape
how the modern world works.

For 75 years, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has been]{.mark} the world's
self-anointed rule]{.underline} writer and enforcer. Intent on
[[preventing]{.mark} another]{.underline} global bloodletting on the
scale of **[[World War]{.mark} II]{.underline}**, Washington attempted
to craft a world order cemented in shared norms, with international
institutions to enshrine and uphold them. Backing it all up was the
might of the American military. That order has been imperfect, subject
to abuse by an array of countries---America included---but it has kept a
lid on big-power conflict, while spreading economic prosperity and
democratic principles across much of the globe. It's an order that,
though somewhat tattered, the Biden administration is striving to
maintain with, for instance, today's Summit for Democracy.

But the [American [monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline} on rule writing
[[is]{.mark} now [facing its]{.mark} **stiffest [challenge]{.mark}**
[since]{.mark} the fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. As China rises
in stature, [[Beijing is promoting its own concepts about]{.mark}
**global [governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, development, and
international relations, grasping influence at institutions [[such as
the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
[to infuse]{.underline} these [concepts into]{.underline} global
[discourse]{.underline}, and using its growing wealth and military might
to contest the existing norms of the American world system.

Ultimately, this is what the Meng dispute is really about: a widening
confrontation between the U.S. and China over who sets the rules on
trade and technology, climate change, and public health. Fundamentally,
[it is about the principles and precepts that guide how
countries]{.underline}, companies, and individuals
[interact]{.underline} on a global scale, [a competition over whether
the world will be one of the "**rule of law**" or the "**rule by
law**]{.underline}."

The main purpose of the West's original policy of engagement with China
was to avoid this very situation. By integrating Beijing into the
U.S.-led system, the thinking went, the Chinese leadership would see its
benefits and come to support it. On a certain level, the plan succeeded.
[China has been a major beneficiary of the American
order]{.underline}---perhaps the biggest of all. The security, trade,
and cross-border investment fostered by the U.S. order propelled China's
rise from poverty, while Beijing eagerly immersed itself in U.S.-backed
institutions such as the World Trade Organization.

Yet today, China's paramount leader, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping, [appears
to consider the U.S. system a constraint on Chinese power.]{.underline}
For a proud autocracy, the American order can seem an unfriendly, even
threatening place, one where liberal political values reign supreme, and
the Chinese form of government is perceived as illegitimate, while
Chinese companies and officials are vulnerable to foreign sanction and
Chinese ambitions are hemmed in. From Xi's perspective, it is critical
that Beijing rewrite the rules to better suit its interests and, more
broadly, those of authoritarian states. Simply, Xi intends to flip the
global hierarchy, placing illiberal governments and ideals at its apex.

[[Xi "wants to dominate]{.mark} the]{.underline} rule of
**[law]{.underline}**," Jerome Cohen, a longtime expert in Chinese law,
told me. Xi believes that "you have to have rules that suit the interest
of the majority of countries," and "he sees the Anglo-Americans as being
a minority now," Cohen continued. "That minority should be governed by
the autocracies of the world who are amenable to the Chinese point of
view."

The U.S. has faced a similar challenge before, from the Soviet Union
during the Cold War. But because China is more integrated into the
American order, especially economically, than the Soviets ever were, it
presents a more dangerous threat. Beijing is attacking the world order
in a pincer movement. From the outside, it markets its ideas,
governance, and development model as superior to the West's; from the
inside, it works within the very institutions and networks that bind the
U.S. order together.

[Take]{.underline}, for instance, [[the **B**]{.mark}elt]{.underline}
and **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oad
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nitiative, [Xi's pet program that
[finances]{.mark}]{.underline} and builds railways, power stations, and
other [[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} in developing nations. This
[undertaking is an effort [to change]{.mark}]{.underline} the way
**[international [development]{.mark}]{.underline}** is done [[by
offering an alt]{.mark}ernative [to]{.mark} the established practices of
the [Western powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and their institutions, such as
the World Bank. Beijing's state banks generally don't follow the norms
on lending to poor nations designed (after much trial and error) by
other major creditor countries, nor has China participated in processes
to manage that debt, such as the Paris Club. Instead, [Chinese [lending
is based on]{.mark} China's rules,]{.underline} often [with [**less
transparent** terms and **weaker standards**]{.mark}]{.underline} on
**[labor practices]{.underline}**, **[corruption]{.underline}**, and
**[environmental protection]{.underline}**. Kristen Cordell, a
development policy expert, wrote in a 2020 report on Belt and Road that
"the willingness of China to abide by international rules and processes
for these investments has been secondary to its interest of shaping
norms for its favor."

Meanwhile, [China's]{.underline} inroads at the United Nations show how
the country [is eating away at the American order]{.underline} from its
very core. Beijing is using its influence to promote Belt and Road. It
also employs its growing clout to infuse the institution with its own
ideological principles on issues such as human rights and state
sovereignty. Last year, at the **[UN's Human Rights
Council]{.underline}**, 53 countries [sided with [China]{.mark} on its
controversial imposition of a national-security law]{.underline} on Hong
Kong, which allowed authorities to crack down on the city's prodemocracy
movement; at this year's UN General Assembly, more than 60 members
trumpeted China's position on human rights---essentially, that a
nation's rights violations are none of the world's business. Taken
together, these efforts, a 2019 report by the Center for a New American
Security contended, "[[will hasten]{.mark}]{.underline} the export of
some of the most harmful aspects of China's political system, including
[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}, mass
**[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} the
**[[repression]{.underline}]{.mark}** of individual and collective
rights."

Elsewhere, [Beijing has ignored]{.underline} an international ruling and
the [protestations of]{.underline} its neighbors over [its expansion in
the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea, a vital waterway for global trade that it claims
is mostly China's sovereign territory. There, [[**Beijing** is]{.mark}
effectively [attempting to rewrite]{.mark} the standard [norms
on]{.mark} **territorial [waters]{.mark}** and **free
navigation**]{.underline}, basing its position on China's purported
historical role in the area going back more than 2,000 years to the Han
dynasty, and other dubious assertions. To solidify its grip, China has
also utilized bullying and threats: Its coast guard harasses other
nations' ships, and its fishing vessels crowd into waters other
governments contend they have the right to exploit. Beijing also built
man-made islands in the region and stacked them with military
installations. The nations that share the South China Sea, all smaller
and in some cases poorer, have struggled to hold their own.

And then there is the Meng case. She was ostensibly a private citizen
working for an ostensibly private company, but China used the full might
of its government apparatus to defend her. Along with raising her case
in the meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Sherman and through other
channels, Beijing also held two Canadian citizens, the former diplomat
Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor, who were arrested in
China only days after Meng was detained in Canada. The move was widely
seen as an attempt to pressure authorities in Ottawa to intervene and
short-circuit the extradition process, and the differing treatment of
Meng and "the two Michaels" illustrates the gulf in the differing
perceptions of the rule of law between the U.S. (and other democracies)
and China. While Meng defended herself in public hearings, Kovrig and
Spavor faced undefined spying charges in closed-door trials. As the
process dragged on, the pair rotted in Chinese prisons while Meng cooled
her heels in a Vancouver mansion and indulged in fancy dinners and
lavish shopping sprees.

Beijing authorities pretended the affairs weren't connected, but the
truth that the two Canadians were no more than human bargaining chips
was laid bare when the pair were immediately released upon Meng's
settlement with the Justice Department. In a postmortem of the affair,
Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, wrote that "Beijing's actions reconfirmed the
international community's conclusion that China has no regard for rule
of law.

What xi's world order might look like isn't clear. He hasn't elucidated
a complete vision for a replacement system. On the surface, the language
he proffers to describe the workings of a new order sounds innocuous
enough. He talks of a "community of common destiny," with diplomacy
based on "win-win cooperation" and "mutual respect," in which different
social and political systems are accepted. But this is code for a
downgrading of democracy. Unlike the current order, in which liberal
democracy is held up as the sole legitimate form of governance, Xi's
version would raise authoritarianism to equal, or even superior, status.
This would likely result in a world where Washington and its allies
can't decide which states deserve to be sanctioned for the global good,
as they define it, one where Chinese executives such as Meng cannot end
up in foreign courtrooms for allegedly violating the law. Such a system
would suit Beijing's preference to do business with anybody who wants to
buy and trade.

[Xi wants to usurp the U.S. role as arbiter of **global rights** and
**wrongs**, based on an]{.underline} entirely different set of criteria,
such as who does and does not support [Chinese interests]{.underline}
and power. Beijing regularly imposes sanctions of its own on countries
it views as a threat to its interests. Australia, for example, has faced
severe economic coercion, including effective bans on key exports, for
supporting an independent investigation into the origins of the
coronavirus pandemic, which Beijing considers an attempt to undermine
Communist rule. When Lithuania recently cozied up to Taiwan, Beijing
downgraded its diplomatic relations and blocked imports from the
country.

"It's really about replacing a rule-of-law, equality-between-states
system with a hierarchical sensibility that privileges
authoritarianism," Matt Pottinger, chair of the China program at the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies and deputy national security
adviser in the Trump administration, told me. If Beijing succeeds, he
added, "the international order would be far more Machiavellian, and the
UN system would reward the most Mafia-like players."

That's bad enough for the U.S., but it's downright dangerous for
countries that aren't superpowers---which means most of them. These
countries seek protection in a rules-based order, one where they can (at
least in theory) stand up to bullying from more powerful states by
utilizing the rule of law. One reason the government of Australia has
taken a hard line on aspects of Chinese foreign policy is its commitment
to defending the current order. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm
Turnbull wrote last year that "it was manifestly in our interests to
maintain respect for the rule of law in our region because that was the
only way we, and other smaller states, could be sure of preserving our
own freedom and sovereignty."

Confronted by this opposing set of global rules, Washington continues to
try to uphold its own. Huawei is still facing Justice Department
lawsuits, for theft of trade secrets and racketeering, among other
charges. (A Huawei spokesperson said the company "will continue to
defend itself" in the latter case but had no comment on the former.) The
U.S. Navy routinely sends squadrons through the South China Sea to
maintain freedom of navigation, shrugging off apoplectic tirades from
Beijing. President Joe Biden has proposed an alternative to China's Belt
and Road Initiative that would strengthen standards of development and
lending for needy nations. Washington also looks set to initiate a new
regional economic partnership in Asia.

The United States might also consider joining and bolstering agreements
such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though considered a trade pact,
TPP is, in fact, packed with standards on labor and environmental
protections, as well as other key issues for the global economy.

In the end, the [[U.S. and China will]{.mark} likely [**never agree**
on]{.mark}]{.underline} what [[the]{.mark} **global
[order]{.mark}**]{.underline} should be, and [they're never likely to
abide by the other's rules.]{.underline} Ultimately, neither power can
fully enforce its version of the rules, either. To a certain extent,
they both prefer it that way. "The big powers don't want impartial
independent adjudication of their behavior under prevailing
international norms," Cohen pointed out. "They want to settle things
themselves."

The battle over rules is really about power---which country has it, and
which country can project it. [The U.S. has held]{.underline} this
[power for decades]{.underline}; [[the **Chinese** now want it **for
themselves**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Surveillance

#### China will [never]{.underline} be incorporated into the LIO -- surveillance, censorship, human rights violations

Dan **Negrea 22**, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security, 1/1/2022, \"China is the new evil
empire,\" https://spectatorworld.com/topic/china-new-evil-empire/, sg

History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In the 1980s, the
gravest threat to America's freedoms came from the Soviet Union, which
President Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire. That rhymes with
[[today's]{.underline}]{.mark} equally [**[serious threat]{.mark}** from
Communist China, [the]{.mark} **New [Evil Empire]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [rules China with **absolute
power**]{.underline}, like an emperor. [He [has complete control]{.mark}
over China's]{.underline} sole political party, the [CCP, the
**government**, the **economy**, the **military**, the **police**, the
**judiciary**, and the **media**]{.underline}. Even over religion:
Christian churches must display Xi quotes instead of the Ten
Commandments.

The [**CCP** has]{.underline} an [abhorrent **domestic policy** rooted
in the belief that people's lives are **subordinate** to **state
interests**]{.underline} --- after all, it still venerates Mao and
Stalin, dictators who killed millions of people. Its [[disregard for
human life is apparent in]{.mark} its **[genocide]{.mark}**]{.underline}
against the Uyghurs and its coverup of the Covid pandemic's origin.

[Chinese [citizens live in an **Orwellian techno-surveillance
state**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} **police
[cameras]{.mark}**]{.underline} everywhere [and complete **government
censorship**]{.underline} of the internet. They must use their mobile
phones to study and take exams on the thought of Xi Jinping. [They have
to follow **CCP rules** to maintain their **social credit
scores**]{.underline} so that they can be allowed to travel by plane or
own pets. [[Dissidents are]{.underline}]{.mark} persecuted, imprisoned,
or **[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The CCP's foreign policy is just as reprehensible. [Its
**imperialist**]{.underline}, might-is-right [ideology was
summarized]{.underline} in July 2010 [by its]{.underline} then-foreign
[minister when he demanded that **dignitaries**]{.underline} at a
conference of Asian nations [obey China because "China is a **big
country** and]{.underline} other countries are small countries, and
[that's just a **fact**."]{.underline}

Under this worldview, [**[Xi]{.underline}**'s]{.mark} China [[feels
justified to coerce]{.mark} its **[neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It
has had conflicts]{.underline} with almost all of them, [[and has used
its]{.mark} **military**, **economic**, and **diplomatic** [power to
force compliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

And Beijing's aim is to have the entire world do its bidding. Countries
as far away as Germany and Sweden have been threatened when they've
stood up for human rights in China. American companies and individuals,
afraid to lose business in China, have had to offer abject apologies for
not toeing the CCP line.

There is a disturbing global trend of self-censorship of support for
freedom in China so as to not to become a target of the Xi regime's
reprisals.

In global commerce, [[Xi]{.underline}'s]{.mark} China [[gives]{.mark}
its [companies **unfair**]{.mark} government
[support]{.mark}]{.underline} and a free hand to use shady practices.
Too often, [Chinese companies lie]{.underline}, cheat, and steal to win
business.

These [**lawless actions** are not **mistakes**]{.underline} or
accidents. They are part of a [[CCP worldview under which people]{.mark}
[obey]{.mark}]{.underline} the government, small countries obey big
countries, and the whole world obeys [[the]{.mark} **Beijing
[emperor]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [CCP **worldview** stands in [**sharp contrast** to the]{.mark}
rules-based [system that **America**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the West
[[created]{.mark} at the end of **World War II**.]{.underline} This
[[system has]{.mark} at its core the **inalienable
[rights]{.mark}**]{.underline} of all people to life, liberty and
security of person as codified in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the sovereign equality of all nations enshrined in the UN
Charter.

Communist [China's policies are an **existential challenge** to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and the free world.
This is different from the challenge posed by 1980s Japan, which was
then trying to become a major economic power. Or the European Union's
more recent challenge to be recognized as an independent power center in
a multipolar world.

### 2NC -- Ukraine Proves

#### [Ukraine]{.underline} proves China is the core threat to the [international order]{.underline}. 

Tom **McTague 22**, staff writer at The Atlantic based in London,
4/4/2022, \"The Weakness of the Despot,\"
https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/stephen-kotkin-putin-russia-ukraine-stalin,
sg

[**Defenders** of the **west** have a **tendency** to gaze **wistfully**
at the]{.underline} past, lamenting how far today's leaders have fallen.
[Where **America** and its **allies** used to build]{.underline} things,
create **[institutions]{.underline}**, and win wars, [now they seek only
to hold **ground**]{.underline}, conserve what they have, [and escape
**conflicts**.]{.underline}

Such nostalgic longing isn't hard to understand. Immediately after World
War II, Europe was in ruins, its industries and infrastructure
destroyed. Without American intervention, much more of Europe could well
have fallen under Soviet control. But in the space of a few years, the
United States financed Europe's recovery, committed to its defense, and
pushed the continent toward ever-closer union. It was an extraordinary
age.

These enormous changes were not simply the result of the leaders of the
time coming together. "Men make history, but they do not make it as they
please," wrote Karl Marx. They make it, instead, under the circumstances
given to them. At the end of the war, circumstances changed, global
power shifted, allowing leaders to do great things. Today, a similar
change may be under way---though it's hard to see anything great
resulting from it.

After World War II, the principal security threat to democracy shifted,
almost overnight, from Germany to the Soviet Union. And this changed
everything. To deal with the new reality, the U.S. realized,
Germany---or at least the bit of Germany under Allied control---would
need to be rebuilt as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. The prospect
of German reindustrialization and rearmament, however, reignited age-old
French fears. Traditionally, to address this problem, France would ally
itself with Britain. But in 1950, France took a historic leap in the
dark, announcing the first step toward economic integration with
Germany, laying the foundation for today's European Union. Now that the
U.S. had guaranteed European security, France could transfer its
insurance policy from Britain and join with Germany in ways previously
thought impossible.

The Soviet threat kept the U.S. in Europe. And the U.S. presence in
Europe created the conditions for Europe to unite. Since 1950, the basic
tenets of this security order have not changed. American power has
guaranteed the security of the West, allowing Europe's democracies to
band closer together. In 1990, when the Soviet threat collapsed, the
U.S. did not withdraw this security guarantee, but expanded it eastward,
entrenching its hegemony.

In one sense, [Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in
February [appears to have [reinforced the **foundations** of this
**American order**]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[**NATO**
seems]{.underline}]{.mark} [more [united]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
democracies of Europe and North America are working together to oppose
Moscow's expansionism, [and many are **ramping** up their **defense
capabilities**]{.underline}. Looking at the world more broadly, however,
the underlying reality has changed, just as it did after World War II.
Today, even as Russia stalks NATO's border, [[a new]{.mark}, far
[larger]{.mark} [threat to the]{.mark} **American-led [order]{.mark}**
[looms farther]{.mark} to the east: [China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Beijing may not seek a]{.mark} **world
[revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as the Soviet Union did, [[but it
seeks]{.mark} **regional [dominance]{.mark}**, [control of]{.mark}
global **[trade]{.mark} routes**, [and **Taiwan**. Its
autocratic]{.mark} **state-[capitalism]{.mark}** model [offers
inspiration to opponents of **democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and as
it has grown in power, [[it has begun to see **Washington**]{.mark} and
its **allies** [as seeking to constrain its
**strength**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, fully understanding the invasion of Ukraine is impossible
without considering the geopolitical environment in which it is taking
place. Russia is emboldened in its quest to recapture lost influence in
Europe partly because of its alliance with China and the calculation
that American power is giving way.

In fact, [[China's rise]{.mark} challenges the notion **of the West
itself**]{.underline}. Where the Soviet Union posed a direct threat to
Western Europe, [China [threatens America's]{.mark} **liberal democratic
[protectorates]{.mark}** on the other side of the world: Japan, South
Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and others. Suddenly to think of
the **West** comprising only the two sides of the **North Atlantic** no
longer makes much sense.]{.underline} If there is a "West" today---a
free world allied to the U.S.---it stretches from Western Europe to the
Far East and Australasia.

## AT: No China Rise

### 2NC -- China First Strike

#### China's getting ready to first strike us!

David **Sanger and** William **Broad 22,** David E. Sanger is a White
House and national security correspondent; William J. Broad is a science
journalist and senior writer at The New York Times, "As China Speeds Up
Nuclear Arms Race, the U.S. Wants to Talk,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/us/politics/china-nuclear-arms-race.html>,
cy

The Pentagon thinks [Beijing may build **1,000** or more weapons **by
2030**. But it's the **new technologies** that **worry
strategists.**]{.underline}

[The United States has **no nuclear hotline to Beijing**.]{.underline}
The two countries have never had an in-depth, serious conversation about
American missile defenses in the Pacific, or China's experiments to
blind U.S. satellites in time of conflict.

And [Chinese officials have consistently **rejected the** idea of
entering **arms control talks**, shutting down such
suggestions]{.underline} by noting --- accurately --- that the United
States and Russia each have deployed five times more nuclear warheads
than Beijing possesses.

President Biden is seeking to change all that.

For the first time, the United States is trying to nudge China's
leadership into a conversation about its nuclear capability. U.S.
officials, describing the American strategy, say Mr. Biden and his top
aides plan to move slowly --- focusing the talks first on avoiding
accidental conflict, then on each nation's nuclear strategy and the
related instability that could come from attacks in cyberspace and outer
space.

Finally --- maybe years from now --- the two nations could begin
discussing arms control, perhaps a treaty or something politically less
complex, such as an agreement on common norms of behavior.

In Washington, the issue has taken on more urgency than officials are
acknowledging publicly, according to officials who are involved. Mr.
Biden's aides are driven by concern that [a new **arms race is heating**
up over hypersonic weapons, space arms and cyberweapons, all of which
could unleash a costly and **destabilizing spiral** of move and
countermove.]{.underline} The fear is that an attack that blinded space
satellites or command-and-control systems could quickly escalate, in
ways that were not imaginable in the nuclear competitions of the Cold
War. China's capabilities could also pose a threat to President Biden's
hopes of reducing the role of nuclear weapons in American defenses.

In some ways, Washington is focused on the progress of China's nuclear
capability in a way that it has not been since Mao first tested a weapon
in 1964.

In his virtual summit meeting earlier this month with Xi Jinping,
China's president, who clearly has sought to present himself as a
epoch-defining leader alongside Mao, Mr. Biden raised what the White
House has euphemistically called "strategic stability talks."

In interviews, Mr. Biden's aides have said the effort is a tentative
first step toward a far larger agenda, akin to the initial conversations
about nuclear weapons that Russia and the United States held in the
1950s. The starting goal, they insist, is to simply avoid
miscommunication and accidental war --- even if it never rises to the
level of a nuclear threat.

"You will see at multiple levels an intensification of the engagement to
ensure that there are guardrails around this competition," Jake
Sullivan, Mr. Biden's national security adviser, said in a presentation
at the Brookings Institution the day after the virtual summit.

[The nuclear **relationship with Russia**, he noted, is "**far more
mature**, has a much deeper history to it]{.underline}." After the
summit meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi, he added, it is time to
begin such conversations with China. "It is now incumbent on us to think
about the most productive way to carry it forward," he said.

In a sense, this is the revival of an old fear in Washington: In 1964,
Lyndon Johnson was so worried about the rise of another nuclear rival
that he considered, but ultimately rejected, plans to conduct a
pre-emptive strike or covert sabotage on China's main nuclear testing
site at Lop Nor.

But China's decision to maintain a "minimum deterrent" for the past six
decades --- a nuclear force large enough to assure that it could respond
to a nuclear attack, but not nearly the size of America's or Russia's
--- largely knocked its nuclear program off the Pentagon's list of top
threats. Now, its recent moves, from building new missile silo fields to
testing new types of advanced weapons, come just as Mr. Biden's aides
are deep into an examination of American nuclear strategy that will be
published in coming months.

The review, which every new administration is required to undertake in
its first year or so, will contain key decisions --- including whether
to go ahead with a modernization plan that by the last comprehensive
estimate, four years ago, looked likely to cost 1.2 trillion dollars
over the next 30 years. The future of those plans has been the subject
of furious lobbying campaigns, especially among the nation's top defense
contractors.

Earlier this month [the Pentagon concluded that the size of the Chinese
nuclear arsenal may triple by 2030]{.underline}, to upward of 1,000
warheads. [But the administration's concern is not just the number of
weapons --- it is the **new technology**, and particularly how **Chinese
nuclear strategists** are thinking about **nontraditional
arms.**]{.underline}

When [the Chinese launched a hypersonic missile]{.underline} in July,
[circling the globe once and then deploying a maneuverable glide vehicle
that could zig and zag on an unpredictable path and deliver a weapon
anywhere on earth]{.underline}, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, declared that [the U.S. was "very close" to a
"Sputnik moment."]{.underline} But in the weeks since, American
officials have been reluctant to say what, exactly, about that
experiment so rattled them --- beyond the fact that it revealed a
technological sophistication that they did not know the Chinese had
achieved.

The hypersonic nature of the missile --- meaning it can move at more
than five times the speed of sound --- was the least interesting element
of the test. All nuclear missiles go at least that fast. But [the
**stubby glider** it released --- which could hold a nuclear warhead ---
was **designed to evade** the United States' primary **missile
interceptors**, which can operate only in outer space]{.underline}. (In
recent weeks, the Pentagon issued a contract for design work on
technology to intercept the gliders, but that would be years away.)

It's unclear whether China plans to deploy a hypersonic weapon in the
future, and, even if it does, whether they would be armed with nuclear
warheads. But General Milley's deputy, Gen. John Hyten, who is retiring
as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told reporters in October that
the Chinese military had conducted "hundreds" of hypersonic tests,
compared with nine by the United States.

General Hyten said the test, combined with Beijing's other moves, such
as digging hundreds of new silos for long-range missiles, suggest the
Chinese government may now be interested in developing a nuclear
first-strike capability, not just the minimum deterrent.

["Why are they building all of this capability?" he asked on CBS News.
While it is not clear what Chinese strategists intend, he said, the
**hypersonic glide vehicle** appears to be "a **first-use
weapon**]{.underline}."

Inside the White House and the Pentagon, there is no unanimity on that
point. Mr. Biden has long been wary of assessments that could be
intended to drive up the Pentagon's budget --- and certainly American
defense contractors, their executive offices jammed with former senior
military officers, have a vested interest in describing a new threat
that could lead to billions of dollars in new investments.

But even some skeptics agree that the [Chinese hypersonic test, along
with antisatellite **technologies** that could **blind** American
**early-warning** and **command-and-control systems**, suggest a major
rethinking of American nuclear strategy]{.underline} and plans is
overdue.

Gen. John Raymond, who commands the newly created United States Space
Force, recently told New York Times reporters and editorial writers that
in the case of a crisis, he has no direct channel for communicating with
his Chinese counterpart --- a dangerous situation if, for instance, an
accidental collision with a Chinese spacecraft were to be misperceived
as an act of aggression.

That appeared to be at the core of Mr. Sullivan's first concern:
establishing lines of communication between the two militaries, of the
kind the United States and Russia have had for decades. (He avoided the
use of the word "nuclear" in his talk, a reflection of how space,
cyberweapons and other high technologies need to be part of the
conversation, Mr. Biden's senior aides say.)

[On Capitol Hill, the **conversation** so far is largely **about
matching** the **Chinese investment**, rather than rethinking the nature
of the arms race.]{.underline}

regardless of if its citizens or foreigners produced it (Amadeo 2020,
Par. 1). It can be calculated 2 ways: nominal or PPP. [China has already
surpassed the GDP of the U.S. in terms of purchasing power
parity]{.underline} (PPP). PPP refers to the comparison of currencies of
different countries through a 'basket of goods' approach (Hall 2020,
Par. 1). According to the concept, 2 currencies are in equilibrium-when
a basket of goods is priced the same in both countries, taking into
account the exchange rates (Hall 2020, Par. 1[). China is on course to
be the world's largest economy by 2030]{.underline} (Kennedy 2018, Par.
1). According to U.K. based financial services firm, Standard Chartered,
the [U.S. will drop to 3rd place in the global ranking of the world's
largest economies, falling behind China and India]{.underline} (Paton
2019, Par. 1). The projections [suggest China's GDP will stand at \$26
trillion in 2030]{.underline}, up from \$14.1 trillion today (Kennedy
2018, Par. 1). The U.S. will see its GDP rise more slowly to \$25.2
trillion from \$20.4 trillion (Kennedy 2018, Par. 1). [China is in the
process of replacing the U.S. as the engine of the global economy,
providing by far the largest contribution to growth in recent years and
pulling along the world's smaller economies in its train]{.underline}
(Kemp 2019, Par. 1). [China accounted for 28% of all growth worldwide in
the 5 years between 2013 to 2018]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 1). [This
was more than twice the share of the U.S., according to the
International Monetary Fund]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 1). The IMF
predicts China will account for a similar share of growth over the next
5 years between 2019 and 2024 (Kemp 2019, Par. 1). [China, India,
Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil collectively will account for more than
half of all global growth through 2024]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 2).
There is no scenario where the global economy can achieve healthy growth
unless these 5 economies, especially China, see their output and incomes
rise strongly (Kemp 2019, Par. 2). Between the 1970s and 1990s, it was
common to characterize the U.S. as the locomotive of the world economy
(Kemp 2019, Par. 3). [U.S. fiscal and economic policy usually played a
decisive role in the development of the global economic cycle via trade
and financial links to smaller countries]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par.
3). The U.S. is still important, [and the Federal Reserve still remains
at the center of global markets]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 4).
[Despite this, the U.S. economy is no longer large enough or growing
fast enough to act as the sole locomotive for the world economic
train]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 4). [China on its own, and the other
major emerging markets collectively, are now more important drivers of
the global economy]{.underline} (Kemp 2019, Par. 4). China and the other
major emerging markets are themselves increasingly interdependent since
[China is both a major importer of raw materials and supplier of
manufactured products and onward investmen]{.underline}t (Kemp 2019,
Par. 4). China's cyclical position is also important because its rapidly
growing middle class is at the stage of economic development where
demand for oil, cars, air travel, tourism and other industries is
booming (Kemp 2019, Par. 5).

[China also notoriously uses artificial intelligence to track and
control its population]{.underline} (Ioanes 2019, Par. 6). It is also
betting that AI (artificial intelligence) [like autonomous unmanned
systems and intelligent robotics are the future both of economic
advancement and warfighting]{.underline} (Ioanes 2019, Par. 6). [China's
tactic of military and civil fusion also works here, as advancements in
the civilian sector will be easily adapted to military
capabilities]{.underline} (Ioanes 2019, Par. 6). As [China's economy is
the 2nd largest in the world and on the path to overtake the U.S. by
2030,]{.underline} it gives them the ability to [spend far more
resources on its military than in previous decades]{.underline} (Ioanes
2019, Par. 7). Between 1996 and 2015, China increased its military
spending by 620% (Ioanes 2019, Par. 7). China's Ministry of Finance said
the 2019 defense budget was \$177 billion (Maizland 2020, Par. 4).
However, analysts' estimates are often higher than what Beijing reports
(Maizland 2020, Par. 4). [Defense spending increase more than sevenfold,
from \$31 billion in 1998 to \$239 billion in 2018]{.underline}
(Maizland 2020, Par. 4). For much of its history, [the PLA relied on
foreign military equipment, especially from Russia]{.underline}
(Maizland 2020, Par. 5). But in recent decades, [the Chinese government
invested heavily in state-owned and private-sector defense
companies]{.underline} (Maizland 2020, Par. 5). Xi has pushed to reduce
barriers between the two, emphasizing what he calls military-civil
fusion (Maizland 2020, Par. 5). Much of the PLA's equipment is now built
domestically (Maizland 2020, Par. 5). [China is estimated to be the
world's second-largest arms producer, trailing the U.S. and ahead of
Russia]{.underline} (Maizland 2020, Par. 5). After decades of primacy
and focusing on conflicts in the Middle East, **[the U.S. is unprepared
for the kind of military power China is building]{.underline}** (Ioanes
2019, Par. 8). To counter this, the U.S. should study and exploit
weaknesses in China's military strategy (Ioanes 2019, Par. 8). We should
also weaken China's confidence in their own ability to drive the
narrative of conflict and weapons developments by showing our own
military prowess and understanding of the Chinese strategy (Ioanes 2019,
Par. 8). We must also ensure that U.S. technology, strategy, doctrine,
and organizations fit together seamlessly to achieve the American
desired end state (Ioanes 2019, Par. 8). Despite China's military
buildup, I believe the U.S. will remain on top in terms of military
might. The U.S. has historically devoted a larger share of its economy
than many of its allies ("U.S. Defense Spending\..." 2020, Par. 1). The
U.S spends more on national defense than China, India, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, France, Germany, U.K, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil--- combined
("U.S. Defense Spending\..." 2020, Par. 1). Defense spending accounts
for 15% of all federal spending and roughly half of discretionary
spending ("U.S. Defense Spending\..." 2020, Par. 1). China is still in a
distant 2nd place when it comes to defense spending. This still does not
mean that the U.S. should let their guard down when it comes to military
strength. Total discretionary spending---for both defense and nondefense
purposes---represents only about 1/3 of the annual federal budget ("U.S.
Defense Spending\..." 2020, Par. 2). It is currently below its
historical average as a share of GDP and is projected to decline further
("U.S. Defense Spending\..." 2020, Par. 2).

## AT: Counterforce Fails

### 2NC -- Subs

#### [Simple physics]{.underline} proves sub detection.

Katherine **Wright 6-14**-22, Deputy Editor of Physics Magazine,
"Tracking Nuclear Material Aboard Submarines," Physics Magazine,
https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s79

Last year, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to transfer
some of their nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, a country that,
at that time, possessed none. [On hearing the announcement, Bernadette
Cogswell and Patrick Huber of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg say that they
were immediately concerned as there is currently **no easy way** to
**safeguard a nuclear reactor** aboard a submarine.]{.underline} Now,
the duo has come up with a technique that could solve that problem
\[1\]. They say that the method could be used to confirm the presence of
a submarine's nuclear core without the need for onboard monitoring.

Most naval nuclear reactors employ uranium that is highly enriched
fissile uranium-235 ( 235U), a material also used to make nuclear
weapons. For land-based reactors, inspectors keep track of 235U using
neutrino detectors placed close to an operating core (see Feature:
Neutrino Detectors for National Security). But this technique doesn't
work for the water-submerged cores in submarines at sea. It also fails
for the weak signals from powered-down cores, allowing operators to
subvert checks of docked submarines.

Cogswell and Huber's technique solves this issue. [**Even when turned
off**, nuclear reactors emit **antineutrinos** due to the **decay of
235U** fission by-products such as radioactive isotopes of cerium and
ruthenium. Cogswell and Huber predict that these antineutrinos, which
have lower energies than those emitted by an operating reactor, **should
be detectable** using **current technologies** from a docked, submerged
submarine.]{.underline}

pair them with other sensors, like sonars, which "offer longer detection
ranges".33 Magnetic anomaly detection also requires environmental
mapping of the Earth's magnetic field, especially where "variations in
seabed magnetism and the presence of sunken ships generate many false
alarms."34 [A quantum magnetometer promises an **increase in

[Chinese]{.underline} [military leaders have contended they are so far
behind the United States that **their current nuclear posture isn't an
effective deterrent to being attacked**]{.underline}. Maj. Gen. Yao
Yunzhu, China's director of the Center of America-China Defense
Relations for the Academy of Military Science, explained that position
in a letter last year to the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a think tank. "[The Ballistic Missile Defense
systems that the United States and its allies have deployed, or are
planning to deploy, are capable of **intercepting residue Chinese
nuclear weapons launched for retaliation** after it has already been
attacked, thus]{.underline} potentially [negating the deterrence effect
of the Chinese nuclear arsenal]{.underline}," Yun wrote. Furthermore,
[U.S.]{.underline} conventional [missile strike systems]{.underline} in
development [could **strike China's nuclear arsenal**]{.underline},
"which, if adopted as an official doctrine, would discredit China's No
First Use policy," Yun wrote. China's nuclear arsenal is thought to
total about 250 warheads, compared with 2,104 operational U.S. warheads
and thousands in reserve, according to Federation of American Scientists
figures. If [Chinese leaders think their stockpile is in danger of being
wiped out by U.S. aircraft, missiles and other conventional means during
a hypothetical war]{.underline}, it leaves them with two broad options
to protect their nuclear capability: strengthen their potential attack,
or abandon the no first-use policy in favor of something more
threatening. For now, they appear to have chosen the former option.
[China has built]{.underline} three [Jin-class nuclear
submarines]{.underline} capable of carrying the JL-2 missile, which has
an estimated range of 4,600 miles. "This will give the China its first
credible sea-based nuclear deterrent, probably before the end of 2014,"
Pacific Command chief Adm. Samuel Locklear said during congressional
testimony in March. Although the deterrent is considered credible, its
survivability is debatable. Jin-class subs are noisy --- noisier than
the Russian Delta II-class submarines built 30 years ago, according to
an Office of Naval Intelligence report published in 2009. Noise is a
submarine killer, and the U.S. has several ways of listening for them.
Although China could develop a noise solution, multiple U.S. analysts
think that design flaws in the missile compartments and hatches have
left the Jin-class fundamentally flawed. China also has no experience
with commanding and controlling nuclear-equipped submarines. However, it
does have extensive experience with land-based missiles, which are also
the only option capable of striking the continental United States after
being launched from somewhere near China. "So from that perspective,
modernizing the land-based missiles makes some sense," said Vipin
Narang, an associate professor at MIT and author of a recently published
book on nuclear strategy. Besides any conventional strikes, **[a Chinese
nuclear response in a hypothetical war would have to
overcome]{.underline}** three **[major U.S. defenses]{.underline}**:
[the Aegis ballistic missile defense]{.underline}, significant parts of
which are maintained on ships based in Japan and patrolling the Western
Pacific; [the ground-based midcourse defense]{.underline}; [and a

This article will attempt to provide the reader an understanding of the
war's current state and a sense of what strategic direction it may take
in the near future. Since war is essentially a political action
conducted through organized violence, this report will first examine the
political objectives of both parties and how changes on the battlefield
have morphed into changes of war aims. It will next examine the battle
in Donbas and how the tactical fight affects the strategic situation.
Two possible radical changes to the strategic situation will be
considered: The disintegration of the Russian army and the Russian use
of nuclear weapons. This article will conclude with a summary of the
war's possible strategic direction and its growing strategic meaning.

Russia's Shrinking War Aims

President Vladimir Putin's personal view of Ukrainian independence has
been known publicly for decades. In 2007 he told President George W.
Bush that Ukraine was not a real country.\[2\] Russia's desire to
maintain Ukraine within its sphere of influence led it to pressure
then--Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2013 to reject an
association agreement with the European Union. The agreement was
unacceptable to Moscow because it could have led to Ukraine's eventual
integration into the European Union and other institutions of the
Western liberal democratic community.\[3\] When this pressure backfired
and led to the Maidan Revolution in 2014, Moscow illegally annexed
Crimea and supported armed insurrections in two breakaway Ukrainian
oblasts that later renamed themselves the Donetsk People's Republic and
the Luhansk People's Republic

Eight years of conflict between Ukraine and the separatist republics was
paralleled by a Russian propaganda campaign that portrayed Ukraine as a
neo-Nazi fascist state and a puppet of NATO; this provided the
ideological justification for the war. In July 2021, Putin asserted in a
personally written article that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians
were one nation. Later, former Russian president and current security
council deputy Dmitry Medvedev disparaged Ukraine's government as
illegitimate and claimed that it was senseless for Moscow to negotiate
with Kyiv.\[4\] By the end of 2021, official Russian policy mirrored
Putin's informal remark that Ukraine was not a real country and
therefore had no right to exist.

When he started what was euphemistically named a "special military
operation" on February 24, 2022, Putin proclaimed Russia's objectives as
the "denazification and demilitarization" of Ukraine. Using templates
from Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979, he apparently
expected his armed forces and intelligence services to accomplish a coup
de main by seizing Kyiv and installing a compliant government of Russian
collaborators. Putin presented Russia as an aggrieved party forced into
war by a West seeking global dominance and a criminal Ukrainian regime
attempting genocide in the breakaway republics, which had just declared
independence. He insisted that Russia had no territorial ambitions and
that his policy in Ukraine was to free the people of Ukraine who were
kidnapped by their own government.\[5\]\[6\]

However, the [Russian offensive quickly stalled and was unable to seize
either Kyiv or Kharkiv.]{.underline} By early April, [Russian forces
were withdrawing from near Kyiv and redeploying]{.underline} to the
Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. Once it became
clear that Moscow could not achieve its initial war aims, political
objectives shrank in proportion to the diminished capabilities of the
Russian military. The new course was announced by security council chief
Nikolai Patrushev in an April 26 interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the
official Russian government newspaper, when he stated that Ukraine's
hatred of Russia would cause it to disintegrate into several
states.\[7\]

To accomplish this, Russia launched an offensive to fully occupy the
Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine and began
institutionalizing Russian rule in occupied southern Ukraine.
Economically, Russian occupation authorities are replacing the Ukrainian
currency, the hryvnia, with the ruble; they are replacing Ukrainian
textbooks and even teachers with Russian ones; and road signs in
Ukrainian are being replaced with Russian signs.\[8\] Putin has approved
a law to provide Russian passports to Ukrainians in occupied
territories, the same tactic used to justify making Russian
protectorates out of the Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk People's
Republic, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia.\[9\]

Russia is using even more odious methods. Local Ukrainian officials have
been arrested by Russian authorities and have disappeared. Tens if not
hundreds of thousands of residents have been forcefully removed from
their homes, sent to "filtration camps" (first made infamous in the
Chechen Wars), and relocated inside Russia. A small number of
collaborators provide a domestic face for sham procedures to codify
Russian rule, such as "referenda" or "requests" to establish Russian
bases on Ukrainian soil.\[10\]

Tactics such as the arrest and disappearance of indigenous leaders, mass
deportations, corruption of the educational and legal systems, replacing
identity documents, and magnifying the calls of a few collaborators as
examples of "the people's will" were first used by the Soviets in
eastern Poland after September 17, 1939, and then in 1940 to forcibly
annex the independent Baltic states into the Soviet Union. These same
tactics were perfected between 1944 and 1948 to subjugate Eastern
European states under Soviet control.\[11\] They were revived and
adjusted after the fall of the Soviet Union to allow Moscow to support
breakaway republics in Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and
Transdniestria as means of maintaining leverage over Azerbaijan,
Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova. Support to Donetsk People's Republic and
Luhansk People's Republic separatists in 2014 followed this pattern as
well.

These tactics are accompanied by subtle appeals to nostalgia for Russian
imperial greatness by reviving terms like "Novorossiya" or
reestablishing the Tsarist coat of arms for Kherson oblast.\[12\] The
Kremlin probably hopes that nostalgia for imperial greatness will
resonate with the Russian public, as happened after Crimea was seized,
so that revised war aims will be seen as worth the costs involved.

What was proclaimed as a quick punitive expedition has been revised into
a war to annex as much of Ukrainian territory as possible and, within
that territory, to destroy any concept of Ukrainian national identity.
This may have been Putin's real objective for all of Ukraine until
resistance made that impossible. Putin's not-so-subtle remark about
Ukraine's fate before the war, to French President Macron---"like it or
not, my beauty, you have to put up with it"---was not just a crude joke
about rape, but also a clear insight into his thinking.\[13\] That type
of thinking was foreshadowed almost two millennia ago when the Roman
historian Tacitus wrote, "Ubi Solitudinem Faciunt, Pacem Appellant"
(Here they have created a desolation, and called it peace).

**[Ukraine's Expanding War Aims]{.underline}**

Ukraine's initial war aims were simple: Defend itself, protect the
capital and major cities, and survive until Western support arrived. Due
to battlefield successes and Russian war crimes, Ukrainian war aims now
concern the recovery of territory, both from 2014 and 2022, and the
application of justice.

On May 10, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba stated that "In the first
months of the war the victory for us looked like the withdrawal of
Russian forces to the positions they occupied before February 24 and
payment for inflicted damage. Now if we are strong enough on the
military front and we win the battle for the Donbas . . . the victory
for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our
territories."

Kuleba also said only Russia's defeat would allow Ukraine to reopen its
Black Sea ports and revive its export economy. But he also acknowledged
that the bloodshed could be too great and that Ukraine might ultimately
have to negotiate a settlement. In that event, Kyiv would want to
"approach the unavoidable moment with the strongest cards
possible."\[14\]

A secondary war aim is justice. Russian war crimes have been widespread.
Murder, rape, looting, and the deliberate military targeting of
civilians have hardened the average Ukrainian against compromise and
motivated a strong desire for justice. The widespread nature of these
offenses and the Russian government's unwillingness to enforce military
discipline---and worse, awarding a brigade accused of war crimes in the
Bucha massacre with a distinguished unit designation of "Guards" for
"protecting Russia's sovereignty"---indicate that these actions are not
the result of individual criminality, but an official policy of
punishment directed at the Ukrainian people.\[15\]

[With **Russia's objectives** to seize **as much territory as possible**
and destroy within it any concept of Ukrainian national identity, and
**Ukraine's objectives** to **restore full territorial integrity** and
achieve justice for war crimes]{.underline}, there is no current
possibility for a negotiated peace. The war will continue until the
correlation of military power causes one or the other parties to again
adjust their war aims. With a firm understanding of what each side wants
to achieve, this article will now examine the fight to achieve it.

The Donbas Cauldron

Terrain and Troops

As of early June 2022, the cockpit of the war is in Donbas (the name
comes from the term Donets Basin---the watershed of the Donets
River---and consists of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts). Specifically,
the main fighting is taking place in a rough rectangle formed by the
cities of Izium, Barvinkove, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, and Horlivka.
The distance from Izium to Severodonetsk is approximately 50 miles, and
from Lysychansk to Horlivka is approximately 35 miles. The front between
Russian and Ukrainian forces in this general vicinity is much longer, as
it is not a straight line but meanders along rivers, over hills, across
fields, and through numerous villages. Within these confines, tens of
thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers are conducting the most
high-intensity battle in Europe since the fall of Berlin in 1945.

The gentle, rolling, open fields of the Donbas are considered favorable
for tank warfare. When the battle began, some predicted that Russia
would be able to make quick, deep armored penetrations of Ukrainian
lines.\[16\] Instead, the sides have fought a grinding battle because of
the local terrain, the skill of Ukrainian forces to use it to their
advantage, and unimaginative Russian tactics. The Donbas has large open
areas, but running through the battlefield is the Donets River---also
known as Siverskyi Donets---which has proven to be a challenging
obstacle to bridge and cross under fire, and the Oskil River, which runs
north-south between Izium and Severodonetsk. In addition to these
rivers, numerous lakes and reservoirs create natural obstacles to
movement. In the central part of the battlefield is the Holy Mountains
National Park, containing forested cliffs, bogs, and river valleys. This
is part of a northwest-to-southeast-running forest belt between Kharkiv
and Severodonetsk. Numerous crossroads towns and villages are found in
the region, and urban combat in them has proven difficult, time
consuming, and deadly.

The Ukrainian army's familiarity with the Donbas terrain has helped it
stop Russian advances. Ukrainian forces along the line of control with
the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic---known as
the Joint Force Organization Group---have been dug in for years, know
the terrain well, and are Ukraine's most experienced combat units.

Facing them is the Russian army---or, more precisely, three different
groups of Russian forces.

The first group is the elite of the Russian army: paratroopers, naval
infantry, Spetsnaz, and private military companies. These all-volunteer
formations are Russia's most effective fighters and still demonstrate
the will to advance toward and attack Ukrainian forces. They have also
suffered the heaviest casualties. Since all Russian elite forces have
been committed, and it takes years to train them, the possibility of
regenerating additional elite forces soon is nil.

The regular Russian army, consisting of contract soldiers and
conscripts, is the second group. They are plagued with poor morale,
leadership, and logistics. Artillery units are demonstrating high
professional standards and are the most effective combat arm against
Ukrainian units. However, the effectiveness of other combat arms (e.g.,
tank and infantry) is uneven at best. Many units have been amalgamated
into field-expedient combat formations due to high casualties of their
predecessors. Their advantage over the Ukrainian army in Donbas is not
quality but quantity.

The final group of the Russian army facing their Ukrainian counterparts
consists of "auxiliaries" who use Russian arms, uniforms, and equipment
but are separate from the Russian military. They include Donetsk
People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic militias and Chechen
forces loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov. Soldiers from the breakaway republics
are true cannon fodder, used to the maximum extent possible in Donbas to
minimize Russian casualties. They are often pressed into service, given
minimal (if any) training, and are sometimes armed with World War
II--era bolt-action rifles. Unmotivated and ill supplied, their
offensive capability is questionable. But they may fight well to defend
their homes if Ukrainian counterattacks ever enter Donetsk People's
Republic and Luhansk People's Republic territory. The Chechens, despite
their fearsome reputation---or maybe because of it---seem to be used
more in the rear as blocking forces to prevent retreats---a similar
mission to Soviet secret police (known as the NKVD) units in World War
II.

The Tactical Situation

The Battle of the Donbas has been a meat grinder for both sides. Each
army is losing several hundred soldiers killed or wounded daily.\[17\]
While the Ukrainian army has conducted a stubborn defense, the Russian
army has advanced on the flanks of the exposed Ukrainian salient in
Donbas. The easternmost edge of the salient is at the cities of
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, and its flanks are near the towns of
Popasna and Dronivka. Russian advances taking Popasna and spreading out
across the base of this salient threaten Joint Force Organization units
along the Siverskyi Donets River. There has also been Russian progress
to the west of this salient in the vicinity of Lyman.

The Kremlin would likely consider further advances requiring the
evacuation of this salient and the surrender of Severdonetsk and
Lysychansk a major step forward in achieving its political goal of
"liberating" all of Donetsk and Luhansk. However, this accomplishes
little strategically unless Russian forces encircle and capture tens of
thousands of Ukrainian troops. Based on previous Russian rates of
advance, the Ukrainians should be able to withdraw in good order if a
decision to conduct a tactical retreat is made in a timely manner.
Occupying all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts up to their administrative
borders accomplishes nothing strategically, beyond a short-term
propaganda victory, if it does not destroy the Joint Force Organization
Group. Furthermore, it does nothing to prevent the flow of Western arms
and ammunition into Ukraine to increase the size and capabilities of the
Ukrainian army. Therefore, a tactical defeat in Donbas is not a
strategic defeat for Ukraine if it is able to preserve a large part of
its army or if the ongoing efforts to enlarge and equip its army are
successful. It is not a strategic victory for Russia if it ends up
destroying its army through high casualties, which cannot be replaced
anytime soon, and crushed morale.

The Strategic Situation

[The Russian military is expending thousands of lives]{.underline} in
Donbas to make incremental, almost World War I--style, advances over
terrain that has no real strategic value. Russia is fighting a war of
attrition. In the past, Russia and the Soviet Union had the manpower to
make this an effective strategy. However, Russia today no longer has the
mechanisms to recruit, train, equip, officer, and deploy substantial new
military formations.

In early April, I estimated Russia had suffered approximately 10,000
soldiers killed in action (KIA) and a total of 35,000--38,000
casualties. It is still hard to estimate losses, but if Russian
killed-in-action figures are now, per British intelligence estimates,
roughly 15,000, then total casualties by early June could be
approximately 50,000 men.\[18\]

Who will replace them? The 130,000 Russian conscripts called up on April
1, 2022, are not supposed to go to a war zone (but many will). Putin,
probably fearing social unrest, passed up the opportunity on Victory Day
on May 9 to declare war and announce a general mobilization of Russian
manpower.

Without a general mobilization, how can the Russian army meet wartime
requirements and replace its losses? [As word of horrible combat
conditions reaches the population, recruiting of contract soldiers will
suffer. It probably already has, based on the extreme decision to allow
up to 50-year-old men to volunteer.]{.underline}\[19\] Many contract
soldiers are already announcing their intention to leave the army or
refuse to serve in the "special military operation" that Moscow claims
is not a war. Increased conscription cannot make up for recruiting
shortfalls in a country where evading military service is practically a
national sport.

If enough soldiers are found, who will lead them? Even before the war,
Russia was having a difficult time retaining junior officers.\[20\] In
this war, officers of all levels have borne an extraordinary brunt of
casualties. Many officer cadets have graduated early to participate in
the war. Furthermore, who will train the new soldiers? Basic and
advanced training in Russia's army is done at the individual unit level,
but many training officers and noncommissioned officers have already
deployed with their units to Ukraine. This leaves limited cadres at home
to instruct new conscripts.\[21\] Metaphorically speaking, the Russian
army is eating its seed corn.

[If enough enlisted men and junior officers can be found]{.underline} to
serve as replacements for the tens of thousands of casualties, [can
Russia equip them with modern weapons? **Equipment losses are
catastrophic.**]{.underline} The Oryx website, using conservative,
thoroughly documented confirmation techniques, estimates that as of the
end of May 2022, Russia had lost 741 tanks, 1,342 armored/infantry
fighting vehicles, and 27 fixed-wing combat aircraft.\[22\] Actual
losses are likely higher.

Besides these losses, vehicles, airplanes, and helicopters involved in
three months of nonstop fighting require major refitting, which is
unlikely to happen while combat operations are underway. War can exhaust
machines as well as men, and without proper maintenance, existing
hardware will become incapable of supporting operations. New
replacements for destroyed equipment will not be coming. Russia's main
tank factories have shut down due to sanctions, which have also hobbled
its aircraft industry.\[23\] T-62 tanks have been pulled out of reserve,
but half-century-old tanks are no answer to modern anti-tank
weapons.\[24\] [Decades of munitions production have been used up in
three months, and the **decline** in the use of guided and **cruise
missiles** indicates that **precision-guided weapons** are **in short
supply**.]{.underline}\[25\]

Ukraine is also facing serious military difficulties. It has not
concentrated enough forces in Donbas to match Russia's current
quantitative edge, and it too is suffering high casualties. The previous
article in early April estimated that Ukraine had suffered approximately
3,100 killed in action and 16,000--18,000 casualties of all types. On
April 16, President Zelensky announced that Ukraine had suffered between
2,500 and 3,000 killed in action and an additional 10,000 wounded.
Extrapolating from these figures to the present, Ukrainian military KIA
figures could be approaching 6,000 men and approximately 25,000 total
casualties due to the high intensity of the battles of the Donbas and
Mariupol.\[26\] Per Oryx, Ukraine has lost 186 tanks, 276
armored/infantry fighting vehicles, and 22 fixed-wing combat aircraft,
but these again are conservative figures.\[27\] Attrition warfare is
cutting both ways. The winner may be the side that lasts just a moment
longer than the other.

There are strategic differences between Russian and Ukrainian losses.
[Ukraine is in a better position to replenish its losses of men and
materiel.]{.underline} It can afford to trade some territory for time to
assimilate Western supplies. With incoming weapons from the West and the
training of new volunteers, the Ukrainian army will grow in numbers and
capabilities, [while the Russian army is unlikely to. When ready,
Ukraine will have the forces to counterattack.]{.underline} The Croatian
army did the same after losing territory in 1992 to Serbian forces. By
1995, with Western tutoring and supplies, Croatia had rebuilt its army
and counterattacked, forcing the Serbs out of the Krajina region within
a week. Ukraine could play a similar "long game."

Morale and the Future of the Russian Army

[The Russian army will find it hard to replace personnel loses and
harder to replace materiel losses. Weapons drawn from dormant Soviet
stockpiles will have limited utility]{.underline} against a
modern-equipped enemy. Unlike the Ukrainian army, [the **Russian army**
is **unlikely to increase** in size or **improve capabilities** such as
logistics and **leadership** anytime soon.]{.underline}

Therefore, its morale is unlikely to improve. In April, I examined
morale by comparing today's Russian army against historical indicators
for unit cohesion. None of those indicators were positive then, and none
are now. Russian army morale issues are now expressed freely in Russian
social media. While combat refusals, murdering officers, self-inflicted
wounds to avoid combat, etc., happen in every war, there is a point
where low morale, combined with ill-discipline, leads to either mutiny
or disintegration.

The Russian military has mutinied several times before in its history,
from the 1825 Decemberist uprising to the battleship Potemkin, to the
events of 1917. Could it realistically happen again?

A few small-sized units have refused to deploy to or fight in
Ukraine.\[28\] Soldiers argue that since the fighting in Ukraine is a
"special military operation" and not a war, they are not legally
obligated to participate. However, beneath the surface of these
complaints are not legal concerns but human ones: high casualties being
suffered for a cause that is unjust and strategically unsound. Men in
combat have breaking points; [militaries as social organizations have
breaking points]{.underline}. A Russian commentator has noted that
revolts are most prevalent in conscript armies that have a low level of
training and have experienced defeat in a protracted war.\[29\]

This raises the question, [How long can the Russian army sustain major
losses for minimum gains and still function?]{.underline} There are
different ways an army can disintegrate. The Tsarist army mutinied twice
in 1917---first in late February, in protest of continuing the war and
monarchy, and again later that summer after the ill-fated Kerensky
offensive. Soldiers, demoralized by previous defeats, Bolshevik
propaganda, and horrible living conditions, revolted against their
officers and either deserted or formed revolutionary committees to
overthrow the Provisional Government. On the other side of the war, half
the French army also mutinied in 1917 after the heavy losses in the
Neville Offensive. However, their combat refusals were a sit-down strike
and not an insurrection. They would not go on the offensive but would
defend France. Sympathetic French leadership, furloughs, and changes to
suicidal tactics restored morale.

Since there are three distinct Russian military groups fighting in
Ukraine, each could react differently to the same situation. The elites
may never revolt or could lead a revolt based on their high casualties.
Auxiliaries could emulate the Tsarist army in 1917, while the regular
Russian army might react like the French army in 1917. Only time will
tell.

Another way an ill-disciplined army with poor morale can fall apart is
when attempting to retreat under fire---the most difficult of military
actions. If faced with a situation in which the enemy has penetrated
deeply into the rear and cut off supplies and avenues of retreat, units
can panic and descend into every-man-for-himself anarchy. This could
happen if Ukrainian forces were to launch a surprise counteroffensive
that quickly reached deep into the rear of Russian-occupied territories.
This is a risk on an operational level if Ukrainian forces near Kharkiv
counterattacked to seize Kupyansk and destroyed two bridges over the
Oskil River, thereby trapping Russian forces in a pocket around Izium.
At the strategic level, if Ukrainian forces were able to quickly retake
Kherson, cross the Dnepr River, and reach Crimea's Perekop Isthmus, this
would have a stunning effect---similar to the Inchon landings during the
Korean War. Seizing the Perekop Isthmus and dissolving Russia's land
bridge to Crimea would make Russian gains along the Sea of Azov for
naught and would create a devastating psychological effect by
threatening the peninsula.

This is just one possible scenario. [After months of heavy casualties,
limited successes, and poor logistics, leadership, and morale, any type
of strong, sudden, psychological shock to the Russian army could be
devastating. This would also have obvious domestic political
consequences in Russia.]{.underline} The conventional wisdom behind
sanctions has been that by [collapsing the Russian economy, popular
unrest will force Putin to withdraw his army to save his
regime.]{.underline} The Russian economy is ailing, but it is a long way
from failing. However, in less time than it takes the economy to
collapse, the Russian army may do so. An army that is either
unambiguously defeated on the battlefield and disintegrates or mutinies
is likely to cause popular and elite unrest over the conduct of the war
that will force Putin from power. Social revolt may not be caused by
economic deprivation, but rather from outrage at seeing the Russian army
defeated.

#### 2. [NO MOTIVE]{.underline}. Putin [doesn't care]{.underline} about China and knows he'd get [bodied.]{.underline}

Sam **Ashworth-Hayes 3/9**, former director of studies at the Henry
Jackson Society, "In defence of mutually assured destruction,"
<https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/in-defence-of-mutually-assured-destruction>,
cy

The slow return of the 1980s has reached its logical conclusion. The
[prospect of nuclear annihilation is **haunting our
nightmares**]{.underline} once again. Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline}
invasion of Ukraine has been marked by a willingness to engage in
blatant nuclear sabre-rattling of a sort not seen since the end of the
Cold War.

From his [statement that anyone \'interfering from outside\' would
\'face consequences greater than any you have faced in
history\']{.underline} to his placing Russia's nuclear forces on \'a
special combat duty regime\', Putin's strategy has been to threaten
nuclear war to keep the West out of what he sees as his business.

[But these **threats don\'t mean** that **Putin is about to send
missiles** soaring over **Europe** at any moment.]{.underline} Nuclear
analyst Pavel Podvig believes that the 'special combat duty' is nothing
more than an elevated state of vigilance rather than an instruction to
make Russia's system 'ready to fire'. [Putin's words are instead an
attempt to disincentivise certain western behaviours.]{.underline}

The question of whether he would actually use these weapons is in some
senses irrelevant; what matters is that we can't be sure he wouldn't. In
much the same way that a bank teller faced with an armed robber is
unlikely to push the issue of whether he's willing to pull the trigger,
Nato is unwilling to initiate a potential military conflict.

To carry the analogy forward, two men with loaded weapons would be
careful to interact politely and predictably, rather than making
aggressive and unexpected motions.

[Mutually assured destruction works because both sides believe that the
use of nuclear weapons]{.underline} on their part [would be
met]{.underline} in kind, [with]{.underline} any conflict entering an
[irreversible escalation.]{.underline} Because the rational response to
a nuclear launch is a nuclear launch, there is no incentive to engage in
one. And because conventional conflict raises the risk of nuclear war if
the parties are unbalanced, there is a strong incentive to avoid that
too.

In other words, so long as both of our men are sitting with their
weapons drawn and loaded, [neither wants to fire. Putin himself has
observed that nuclear war \'would be a global disaster for humanity\'
and a thing to avoid,]{.underline} but that if provoked \'I must ask
myself: why would we want a world without Russia?\'.

Rather than signalling imminent conflict, Putin's rhetoric is a reminder
that we should be aware of this balance. [Those concerned about his
sabre-rattling can **find some comfort** in the **Russian statement** on
its **nuclear doctrine**, which **lists the circumstances** under which
the state would consider using its nuclear weapons: the launch of
ballistic missiles **targeting Russia**, the use of **weapons of mass
destruction** within its territory, conventional forces **threatening**
the existence of the **Russian state**, or an attempt to 'decapitate'
Russia's nuclear forces.]{.underline}

Of course, a degree of ambiguity over when and why these weapons would
be used gives the threat of their deployment greater weight, and the
existence of a doctrine hasn't stopped speculation over other
circumstances when they might see use. Some analysts -- and the 2018 US
Nuclear Posture Review -- have speculated that Russia could use a
strategy of 'escalate-to-de-escalate', deploying nuclear weapons or
their threat to cement battlefield advantage or terminate a conflict.
This is not contained within the Russian strategy document, although
suspicious readers could find things to dislike in the phrase
\'preventing the escalation of hostilities and their termination on
terms acceptable\'.

[It is the existence of this ambiguity, though, and a desire to avoid
accidental escalation that has led Nato to firmly commit to avoiding
direct conflict with Russia in Ukraine]{.underline}. And for all the
talk, [neither Russia nor America has put its forces on standby for
imminent use. **America** has **more command and control aircraft**
making flights, ensuring that its **command chains would survive** an
attempt at a **pre-emptive strike**. Russia is making sure that its
facilities are staffed.]{.underline}

## AT: Nuclear Winter

### 2NC -- No Winter

#### [Best]{.underline} scientific models concluded even [worst-case]{.underline} scenarios do not produce anything [close]{.underline} to a nuclear winter.

Jon **Reisner et al 18**, scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory,
with Gennaro D\'Angelo, Eunmo Koo, Wesley Even, Matthew Hecht, Elizabeth
Hunke, Darin Comeau, Randall Bos, James Cooley, February 13, 2018,
"Climate Impact of a Regional Nuclear Weapons Exchange: An Improved
Assessment Based On Detailed Source Calculations," JGR Atmospheres
Volume 123, Issue 5,
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JD027331

There have recently been new simulations of a limited nuclear exchange
in the India-Pakistan region using modern climate models (e.g., Mills et
al., 2014; Stenke et al., 2013) that suggest devastating impacts on
climate over a decadal time scale, although somewhat less extreme
consequences have also been suggested (Pausata et al., 2016). Our team
has taken a careful look at some of the assumptions that were used in
those studies, using an end-to-end modeling sequence. [Our series of
simulations started with a nuclear weapon explosion followed by a
simulation of the **fireball** and **cloud rise**]{.underline}. [The
**key improvement** in this study is our simulation of fire spread and
soot transport in the environment that **results from fires** initiated
by the fireball.]{.underline}

Due to the heat of the fire and of the BC particles that are produced,
[some of the particles are lofted into the stratosphere. However, our
**comprehensive urban fire simulations** indicate that the bulk of the
carbon mass remains in the troposphere, where it is **quickly removed**
from the atmosphere. I]{.underline}n most previous work, for example,
that of Stenke et al. (2013) and Mills et al. (2014), all of the soot
produced by the urban fires is directly injected near the top of the
troposphere, and therefore much of it rises into the stratosphere, where
it shades and cools the Earth[. In contrast, if we use a **realistic
vertical profile** for the BC aerosols as input to the climate model,
the long-term global impacts on climate **are much less severe** than
predicted by previous studies. This was true even with **conservative,
worst case assumption**s regarding BC production.]{.underline}

To assess the significance of differences between a limited nuclear
exchange scenario and the control climate, we created an ensemble of
forced (BC-loaded) simulations using a range of realistic vertical
emission profiles, all consistent with our detailed fire simulation. A
similar ensemble generated using small atmospheric temperature
perturbations allows a robust statistical comparison of our simulated
results with and without the carbon forcing. This analysis demonstrates
that while modest, statistically significant differences occur during
the first few years, [longer-term impacts are **unlikely**, **regional**
in scope, and **limited** in scale. **None** of the simulations produced
a **nuclear winter effect**.]{.underline}

We also completed a thorough nuclear weapon simulation, determining that
it was not necessary for this study and that the impact on climate of
the fireball and cloud rise is negligible. There are other, worse
effects than those on climate, however, such as nuclear fallout in the
region. Such consequences will be the focus of our future work using
both xRage and HIGRAD-FIRETEC. Likewise, we will conduct a more
comprehensive investigation of regional effects, such as potential
consequences for the Asian monsoon during the first few years after the
nuclear exchange in follow-on work. Additionally, although this study
examines a possible exchange between India and Pakistan via the
injection of soot over this region, our modeling system could be used to
examine potential impacts of other regional exchange scenarios.

### 2NC -- No Radiation

#### Radiation not existential- fallout patterns are uneven, and fallout dissipates 

**Ladish, 20** -- (Jeffrey Ladish- Cybersecurity and biosecurity
consultant assisting Dr. Megan Palmer\'s group in research on the
management of dual use technologies \"Nuclear war is unlikely to cause
human extinction\", 11-7-2020, Leswrong,

[Radiation won\'t kill everyone because there aren\'t enough weapons,
and radiation from them would be concentrated in some areas and wholly
absent from other areas]{.underline}. [Even in the worst affected areas,
lethal radiation from fallout would drop to survivable levels within
weeks.]{.underline} Here it\'s worth noting that there is an inherent
tradeoff between length of halflife and energy released by
radionuclides. The shorter the half life the more energy will be
released, and the longer the half life the less energy. [The fallout
products from modern nuclear weapons are very lethal, but only for days
to several weeks.]{.underline} Let\'s try the same calculation we used
with kinetic damage, and see if an attack aimed at optimizing fallout
for killing everyone could succeed. Using Nukemap again, I\'ll go with
the fallout contour for 100 rads per hour. 400 rads is thought too be
enough to kill 50% of people, so 100 rads per hour is likely to kill
most all people not in some kind of shelter. [We need to switch to using
a groundburst detonation rather than an airburst detonation, because
groundbursts create far more fallout]{.underline}. A 1mt ground burst
would create an area of about 8,000 km² of \>100 rads per hour. Okay,
multiple that by 14,000 warheads, and we get 112 million km². That\'s a
lot! It\'s still less than the 510.1 million km² of earth\'s land mass,
but it\'s a lot more than the \~10.2 million km² of urban space.
Presumably this is enough to cover every human habitation, so in
principle, it might be possible to kill everyone with radiation from
existing nuclear weapons. n practice, [it would be almost impossible to
kill every human via radiation with the existing nuclear arsenals, even
if they were targeted explicitly for this purpose.]{.underline} The
first reason is that [fallout patterns are very uneven. After a ground
burst, fallout is carried by the wind. Some areas will be hit bad and
some areas will be hardly affected by fallout. Even if most human
population centers were covered, a few areas would almost certainly
escape.]{.underline} Two other things make extinction by radiation
unlikely. [Many countries, especially in the southern hemisphere, are
unlikely to be affected by fallout much at all. Since most of these
countries are likely to be neutral in a conflict, and not near combatant
countries, they should be relatively safe from fallout.]{.underline}
While fallout might travel hundreds of kms[, it still won\'t reach
places separated by greater distances. Fallout that reaches the upper
atmosphere will eventually fall back down, but usually after the period
of lethal radioactivity.]{.underline} The other mitigating factor is
that in typical nuclear war plans, [ground bursts are usually restricted
to hardened targets, and air bursts are favored for population and
industry centers]{.underline}. This is because air bursts maximize the
size of the destructive pressure wave. Air burst detonations result in
little lethal fallout reaching the ground, so populations not downwind
