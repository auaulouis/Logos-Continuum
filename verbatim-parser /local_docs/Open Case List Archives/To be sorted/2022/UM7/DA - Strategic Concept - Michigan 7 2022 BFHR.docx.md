# Strategic Concept DA -- BFHR

### Notes

Not a finished product \-\-- mostly because things could change
significantly in the next two weeks. In case it does, we have written
multiple versions of the disad. Think of the disad as an overstretch da,
that also has arguments about political in-fighting and cohesion. The
better version of the da is probably NOT just the straight cohesion
argument because there are so many things in the alliance that the
allies disagree about. Rather, the disad is an argument about the future
vision for NATO. Every 10 years or so NATO puts out a
document/announcement called the strategic concept. The concept both
reiterates the goals for the alliance for the next decade, as well as
reinforcing the strategy and direction of the alliance. NATO has a
summit in Madrid this coming week where they may theoretically release
the concept. There is talk that due to Russia's invasion of the Ukraine
that they may push back the release of the concept and the accompanying
statements for another 6-12 months. Obviously what happens at Madrid
will change the disad significantly. The disad in its current form says
that the allies are negotiating what will be included in the document.
The general tenor is that they strayed too far away from their core
tasks in the last concept, and that the re-emergence of Russia as a
serious threat to global stability and NATO allies in particular
justifies re-focusing the alliance on Deterrence, while including a new
component about Chinese deterrence. The disad argues that the plan
shifts that focus away by including a new governance/technology/civilian
focus around EDT that is at odds with the current concept strategy.
There are several different link arguments available including focus, a
narrow mandate/agenda, as well as a separate in-fighting/cohesion
argument. The concept is a very important moment for the future of the
alliance with several issues facing the potential cohesion and coherence
of the alliance going forward. Pushing the concept away from its
traditional focus and causing in-fighting with its release has serious
implications for long-term stability and cohesion.

Links overlap for different versions of the disad. If the Madrid talks
formalize the concept, I will shift the uniqueness story for the disad
in future updates. However, the link work the students have done in this
file will work for other versions of this disad. At worst, there is a
cohesion da that has all the components necessary to make it a viable
da. I would just suggest continuous cohesion updates and really staying
on-top of the disagreements within the alliance if you want to go for
that version of the da.

Some other notes:

There are some uniqueness tricks vs. EDT now \-\-- some decent arguments
about the NATO focus on EDT currently being at more of a public-private
partnership level, and that NATO is staying out of the business of EDT
governance and standard-setting. This should jive well with the way that
most of the aff's are written. There is of course, lots of room for
innovation, and I think there are probably domestic political arguments
as well as a potential credibility da about the Secretary General. He
has been trying to get a focus on more tech/EDT into the concept, but
also trying to keep the mandate narrow and focused on Russia, so there
may be some link/link turn arguments either way.

### 1NC \-\-- Concept DA Shell

#### A \-\-- Strategic concept will focus on deterrence -- the direct nature of the Ukraine war means NATO will refocus on conventional deterrence instead of hybrid and non-state threats.

Initial **[discussions on the next Strategic Concept revolved around the
need to prepare the Alliance for a world characterised by the return of
inter-state threats and great power competition]{.underline}**. **[This
alone marked a sharp contrast with the Alliance's post-Cold War focus on
transnational challenges and non-peer competitors. What would the return
of great power competition entail for the evolving balance between
NATO's so-called three core tasks]{.underline}** (i.e. collective
defense, crisis management and cooperative security)? How should NATO
balance a renewed focus on inter-state threats and great power
competitors with the ongoing relevance of transnational threats and
challenges, like terrorism or the climate-security nexus? When thinking
about great power competition, how much emphasis should NATO put on
Russia's immediate threat to Europe, as opposed to the more systemic
challenge represented by China's strategic rise? And what should be the
right balance between the military and non-military aspects of great
power competition? The latter question becomes particularly relevant in
light of the growing salience of "hybrid" forms of warfare and emerging
disruptive technologies, which compel the Alliance to emphasise societal
resilience at home and step up its efforts to innovate technologically.
**[The war in Ukraine -- and ongoing debates about how the Alliance can
assist Ukraine while strengthening deterrence in Eastern Europe -- have
become important topics in Strategic Concept discussions]{.underline}**.
In a way, **[the current war vindicates the view that we do indeed live
in an increasingly competitive world, and that inter-state threats are
back]{.underline}**. On the other hand, **[the overt and direct nature
of Russia's invasion challenges some of the pervading assumptions about
how future conflict was likely to unfold in indirect and hybrid
ways.]{.underline}** The Strategic Concept from a historical perspective
The current NATO Strategic Concept, adopted in Lisbon in 2010, aims to
strike a balance between the Alliance's so-called three core tasks:
collective defense, crisis management and cooperative security. In many
ways, the Lisbon Strategic Concept draws on the previous one (adopted in
Washington in 1999). It represents a crystallisation of NATO's
experience in the post-Cold War period, an era characterised by Western
military-technological supremacy, and the seeming absence of peer
competitors. In the immediate post-Cold War period, the belief that
former adversaries like Russia and even emerging great powers like China
could somehow be integrated in the rules-based order was still widely
held. This was a truly exceptional period. The power surplus enjoyed by
the United States and its allies gave the West a free hand (both
politically and militarily) to engage in ambitious out-of-area
endeavours, and leverage crisis management operations and collective
security initiatives to expand the remit of the so-called open and
rules-based international order, not only in the broader Euro-Atlantic
neighbourhood but also beyond. During the long-post Cold War era,
collective defense and deterrence took a back seat. Even though they
constituted the fundamentals of Euro-Atlantic security, they were
considered almost superfluous in light of Western military-technological
supremacy. Crisis management and collective security ruled the day. But
this world is gone and great power competition is back. That reality was
illustrated by Russia's annexations of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and
Crimea in 2008 and 2014, and even more starkly by its invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. Also striking has been China's strategic rise
and growing assertiveness in East Asia and beyond. Peer competitors are
once again challenging security, and geopolitical and security
architecture in the important regions of Europe and East Asia, but also
the institutional and normative fabric that underpins the open,
rules-based international order. Adapting the Alliance to this new wave
of great power competition is arguably the main challenge in the coming
decade. Beyond Ukraine Since NATO's birth in 1949 -- and potentially as
far back as the industrial revolution -- the Euro-Atlantic region has
been the undisputable centre of gravity of global politics. Developments
in and around the Euro-Atlantic region typically had a profound impact
upon geopolitical and strategic balances elsewhere. However, in today's
and tomorrow's worlds, the opposite is likely to be true. As the
Indo-Pacific becomes the center of gravity of global economic growth,
military competition and technological innovation, dynamics emanating
from that region are likely to have a growing impact on other regions,
including the Euro-Atlantic. Thus, the geopolitical and security
architecture of the Euro-Atlantic region is likely to be increasingly
affected by exogenous factors. In a world that no longer revolves around
the Euro-Atlantic region, and is increasingly defined by China's
strategic rise and the growing centrality of the Indo-Pacific region,
the Alliance will need to think more globally about security. To be
sure, the Euro-Atlantic region will remain NATO's direct referent.
However, the future of that region -- and that of NATO itself -- will
likely become increasingly affected by broader geostrategic dynamics to
a degree and in ways that are unfamiliar to NATO and its member
countries. NATO must therefore adapt to a world in which the
Euro-Atlantic region will remain important, but will probably become a
secondary theatre in world politics, as well as in the context of US
geostrategy. These changes should push the Alliance to develop a more
global approach to security. Beyond the more specific question of
whether NATO itself should act globally (e.g., by developing a presence
in the Indo-Pacific region), the Allies ought to think more
systematically about the main communicating vessels between
Euro-Atlantic security and broader geostrategic dynamics, specifically
the Indo-Pacific. Three stand out: the global implications of China's
rise; the evolution of the Sino-Russian relationship; and America's need
to prioritise between Europe and Asia, and what that may mean for NATO,
European security and the longstanding debate about a transatlantic
division of labour. The war in Ukraine, and Allied efforts to assist
Ukraine and to bolster deterrence in the East, seem to have led to a
revival of the transatlantic relationship, and a renewed focus on
Europe, including for the United States. Yet contrary to what one may
instinctively think, the war in Ukraine is unlikely to alter the steady
shift in the centre of global strategy and politics -- or, for that
matter, of US geostrategy -- towards the Indo-Pacific region. Rather
than halt a shift towards the Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine crisis and the
response to it so far, provide a powerful illustration of how European
geopolitical and security dynamics are increasingly affected by
extra-European ones. For one thing, China- and Asia-centric
considerations have featured prominently in debates about how the United
States should respond to Russia's aggression in Europe. Some experts
argue that the United States should avoid getting bogged down in a
European war -- lest this should distract its attention from the
Indo-Pacific. Others have contended that a strong U.S. response will
deter adversaries and reassure allies elsewhere, notably in the
Indo-Pacific. **[As long as the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific
hinges largely on US power, and as long as these two regions continue to
exercise significant pressure on US defense resources, their alliance
and deterrence architectures will probably remain
intertwined]{.underline}**. This underscores the importance of greater
political and military coordination between NATO and its key partners in
the Asia-Pacific, namely Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea and New
Zealand. For another thing, **[it is also important that NATO and its
Asia-Pacific partners have a common picture on Russia and
China]{.underline}**, and how their relationship may evolve. Without
ignoring existing frictions, if the Sino-Russia relationship remains
broadly cooperative, attempts to drive a wedge between them may prove
challenging. The broader point, however, is that **[whatever the United
States and its European and Asia-Pacific allies think they can do in
relation to engaging Russia or China, or manipulating their
relationship, they must remain aligned]{.underline}**. **[Otherwise,
there is a risk they may draw different conclusions about either power's
trajectory or how their relationship may evolve, and thus frame their
policies on the basis of different premises. This could conceivably
trigger competition between the United States and its allies, and among
NATO Allies themselves.]{.underline}** Conclusion **[The war in Ukraine
has become an important aspect in the debate about NATO's forthcoming
Strategic Concept]{.underline}**. **[Discussions on how
to]{.underline}** continue to assist Ukraine and **[bolster deterrence
along the Eastern part of the Alliance will]{.underline}** no doubt
**[take center stage in Madrid]{.underline}** in June. This is
understandable: deterring a war in Europe is what NATO was created for.
In fact, **[when it comes to the main questions informing the debate on
the Strategic Concept - i.e. the balance between the three core tasks;
state vs. non-state threats; military vs. non-military; Russia vs.
China]{.underline}**, etc. - **[the war in Ukraine may make the pendulum
swing closer to the former than many would have anticipated just prior
to the invasion.]{.underline}**

#### B \-\-- The plan crushes NATO's strategic concept \-\-- causes infighting, collapses cohesion and deterrence and overstretches the agenda

**Dr. Tardy '20**

(Thierry Tardy, PhD in Political Science, Director of the Research
Division at the NATO Defense College (Rome), taught at Graduate
Institute of International and Development Studies (HEID, Geneva), the

Affairs (Sciences Po) and the National Institute of Oriental Languages

//um-ef)

In the debate about congruence, **[one]{.underline}** logical
**[conclusion]{.underline}** of the above-described elements about the
character of the Russian threat **[is]{.underline}** that **[NATO has to
embrace a broader agenda]{.underline}** than the one defined by the
"deterrence and defence" mantra. To remain relevant, **[NATO needs to go
beyond a too narrow defence-focused agenda, the argument
goes]{.underline}**. It needs **[to engage into a securitisation
process]{.underline}**, by which **[issues]{.underline}** that were
**[not previously belonging to its portfolio of tasks, would now appear
on its agenda]{.underline}**. As a matter of fact, the shift to security
is not new. Since the end of the Cold War, the Alliance has indeed
broadened its agenda through activities in the fields of crisis
management, implementing mandates often closer to police tasks than to
genuine military undertakings. In doing this NATO demonstrated a sense
of adaptability and resilience (Menon and Welsh 2011). NATO's role in
Afghanistan's Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), or in humanitarian
relief operations, provides more specific examples of NATO operating at
the frontier of military core tasks to respond to broader security needs
(see Gallis 2007, Jakobsen 2010, Williams 2011). Similarly, NATO's role
in counter-terrorism, energy security (Bocse 2020), security sector
reform, training, or more recently in the cyber domain, also attest to a
broadening of the agenda. The entire discussion about hybrid threats and
warfare epitomises this evolution. **[NATO has also developed expertise
on these issues]{.underline}**, both within its own staff in Brussels
and through its network of Centres of Excellence. To a large extent
thus, the defence agenda is subsumed into a broader security agenda and
**[the challenge is]{.underline}** therefore to make **[trade-offs
between different types of]{.underline}** **[activities]{.underline}**.
We believe though that not only are these activities politically and
operationally less prominent than what the "deterrence and defence"
agenda has implied since 2014, but a key argument of this research is
also that **[further developing these tasks carry risks of
maladaptation]{.underline}**. **[Maladaptation may result from issues
spanning a lack of expertise and legitimacy deficit on many of the new
tasks embraced]{.underline}**, **[inter-institutional duplication and
competition]{.underline}**, **[uneven members states'
backing]{.underline}**, to **[dilution of the Alliance's core military
role]{.underline}**. Enlarging the scope: towards security and internal
threats Acquiring a mandate or a capacity to tackle a broad range of
threats implies that NATO moves in two directions: towards more
security-type activities as opposed to defence-focused ones; and towards
more internal issues. In both directions, a more assertive role for NATO
implies three levels of activity: policy development, i.e. the ability
to produce policy documents that frame NATO's role in a particular
domain; capability development, i.e. the ability to acquire expertise or
resources that can be used for the implementation of a particular
policy; and operations, i.e. the ability to act through operational
activities, be they exercises, training or actual use of NATO and member
states' capabilities placed under NATO command. These three levels allow
us to distinguish between domains where NATO would only act in a
coordination or information-sharing role (for which capability
development and operations are not necessary), and domains where NATO
would be having a more central function. **[Applied to the current
landscape, the broadening security agenda beyond what is already done
would imply a more assertive role for NATO in defensive/offensive cyber
activities]{.underline}** (**[with the cyberspace being an operational
domain and covered by Article 5]{.underline}**), in the fight against
organised crime networks, inter alia through maritime security, as well
as in the broad security sector reform (SSR) agenda of partner
countries, **[to take just a few examples]{.underline}**. In all these
tasks coercion and military effect are not absent, yet they are less
central than in traditional defence activities. The second direction of
**[the move]{.underline}** -- inward-looking -- **[would
mean]{.underline}** that **[NATO plays an increased role
in]{.underline}** the **[defence against internal
threats]{.underline}**, by contributing to: critical infrastructure
protection and resilience building; civilian protection tasks;
police-type activities such as anti-terrorist operations in European
capitals; operations that aim to tackle the security consequences of
(massive) migrant flows; **[or support to police forces facing
under-the-radar hybrid-type non-conventional attacks]{.underline}**.
This would imply establishing relations with a set of national actors,
from law enforcement entities to municipalities, public companies (in
the energy and transport sectors among others) and the private sector
(Machi 2017). The role of NATO in these various activities could vary in
ambition, spanning information-sharing, awareness rising, coordination,
exercises, and more operational tasks. **[The implied risks of task
expansion]{.underline}** Although **[these various tasks]{.underline}**
make sense when assessed against the broad security needs of NATO member
states and societies, and may be justified for political reasons, they
**[carry]{.underline}** a number of **[risks of
maladaptation]{.underline}**. First, **[NATO would have to further
develop]{.underline}** or acquire an **[expertise on issues that can be
very technical, or human resources-heavy]{.underline}**, and for which
even the member states may have a deficit (**[as in the cyber
domain]{.underline}**, energy security, or critical infrastructure
protection). The added-value of NATO's role would be all the more
challenged as its expertise is being questioned. **[Second, the
legitimacy of NATO's role in some areas may be challenged due to a lack
of expertise or because of the possible intrusiveness of NATO's
activities; this leads to sovereignty considerations, with
states]{.underline}** -- be they NATO member states or not -- having
issues with any attempt from NATO to interfere with their internal
sphere, in the law enforcement domain for example. Third, **[any task
expansion would require a degree of]{.underline}** **[consensus within
member states on the merits of the enlarged mandate]{.underline}**, and
**[this will prove]{.underline}** to be **[difficult]{.underline}**,
**[as illustrated by the sensitivities of broadening NATO's
agenda]{.underline}** towards the South, to include counter-terrorism
and migration policies for example (NATO official 2019). **[Even an
agreement on broadening NATO's mandate on the Eastern flank to embrace
security issues would be difficult]{.underline}**. Securitisation is
inherently subjective (Buzan and Waever 2003, Sperling and Webber 2016);
it is the outcome of a political choice that in turn results from an
intersubjective understanding of what constitutes a threat. It follows
that **[consensus-building on newly identified threats or policies is
all the more difficult]{.underline}**. **[Fourth]{.underline}**, the
broad security field is already crowded with institutions that in some
areas would appear in a stronger position. **[NATO's positioning on the
broad field of activities would potentially duplicate existing
capacities]{.underline}**, **[and place it in direct competition with
others, often in a weaker position]{.underline}**. From the SSR domain
in Sub-Saharan Africa to police or border tasks within European states,
actors like the EU, national administrations, police forces and NGOs
would not necessarily welcome a NATO role. Fifth, **[any broadening of
NATO's mandate would be resisted as it would]{.underline}** carry the
**[risk]{.underline}** of **[diluting NATO's war-fighting
capability]{.underline}**. **[Contemporary war-fighting is arguably
politically, financially and operationally demanding; any parallel
effort can, therefore, be seen as a deleterious diversion]{.underline}**
(see Stapleton 2016). **[Cyber security provides a good example of these
risks]{.underline}**. **[Cyber is arguably a key dimension of NATO's
mission.]{.underline}** It is part of "NATO's core task of collective
defence", and its qualification as an operational domain implies that
NATO "must be able to operate as effectively in cyberspace as \[it
does\] in the air, on land, and at sea to strengthen and support the
Alliance's overall deterrence and defence posture" (NATO 2018, para. 20)
At the 2014 Wales Summit, Allies have also stated that a cyber attack
could lead to the invocation of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.
Furthermore, NATO has developed a fair amount of doctrinal and policy
documents in that domain. **[Yet the extent to which NATO can play an
important role in cyber security is uncertain for reasons that have to
do with expertise, capabilities, the nature of the threat and of its
possible targets, and therefore the nature of the
response]{.underline}**. In terms of expertise, while NATO may provide
support to the states that suffer shortfalls, notably through its Cyber
Rapid Reaction teams, **[the Alliance does not display obvious
comparative advantages vis-à-vis most member states]{.underline}** (NATO
Official 2019). **[As for capabilities to conduct cyber attacks, NATO
has so far relied exclusively on its member states, through the concept
of "sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies", and
integrated "into Alliance operations and missions]{.underline}**" (NATO
2018, para. 20). **[The fact that cyber attacks (on NATO member states)
would most likely target entities that are either private actors, or in
any case under the protection of domestic police forces, is also an
issue.]{.underline}** As put by a NATO official, while what can be
sought is a "military outcome, it cannot be achieved solely through
military means", and "what may be a military challenge is in fact
inextricably linked with both civilian government, private industry and
even individuals" (Brent 2019, p. 2). **[These issues lead back to the
question of how much NATO can deter cyber attacks, in relation to both
deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial.]{.underline}**
**[Those limitations apply beyond the cyber domain, to
most]{.underline}** of the **[current threats, for which a military
response can be necessary, but very seldom sufficient nor even
central.]{.underline}**

Russian President Vladimir **[Putin's invasion of Ukraine has
reinvigorated the Western alliance and bolstered transatlantic
solidarity.]{.underline}** After being declared "brain dead" by French
President Emmanuel Macron in 2019, **[NATO has sprung to
life]{.underline}**, **[deploying forces to its eastern flank and
coordinating the provision of sophisticated weapons that have helped
Ukraine impede Russia's invasion]{.underline}**. For the first time in
its history, the European Union has financed the purchase and delivery
of lethal aid. Western countries have vastly exceeded expectations in
implementing coordinated financial sanctions that have crippled Russia's
economy. Even neutral Switzerland joined the fray. But **[no matter how
remarkable this solidarity may be in the short term, there is no
guarantee that it will last: if policymakers are complacent, powerful
trends predating the Ukraine crisis could overwhelm and ultimately
derail it.]{.underline}** Protectionist sentiment and self-defeating
trade wars have pulled at the seams of Western economic integration.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to pull out of NATO and the
chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 have chipped away at
military trust between the United States and Europe. A Marine Le Pen
victory later this month in France would pose additional challenges to
the alliance, and looming concerns about the 2024 presidential election
raise doubts about the United States' commitment. **[If not managed
intelligently, the reawakening of Europe as a diplomatic and military
actor]{.underline}** and the reexamination of global economic
interdependence **[catalyzed by Russia's invasion could result not in a
strengthened transatlantic alliance but in a more worrying outcome: the
emergence of three distinct blocs, one centered around the United
States, a second around Europe, and a third around China]{.underline}**
(which would include Russia). Such a world---with the United States and
Europe often collaborating, but also at odds when their interests
diverge---would make the management of China and Russia more difficult,
as the two would have opportunities to trigger and exploit U.S.-European
tensions. It would also represent a major missed opportunity for the
United States and Europe.

needs to navigate its adaptation to its illiberal challenge while
avoiding functional over-extension]{.underline}**. **[The alliance is at
risk of maladaptation]{.underline}**, **[whereby it extends its own
activities unnecessarily into civilian areas of security in which it
lacks necessary expertise and legacy]{.underline}**. Strong voices in
the expert community call for NATO to specify resilience as a core task
in the forthcoming Strategic Concept, in principle elevating it to a
task of equal importance to collective defense. An influential report
commissioned by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to inspire the
Strategic Concept recommends that NATO reinvent itself as a "liberal
bulwark" against Russia and China and extend the alliance's
responsibilities into the realm of democratic resilience. **[NATO must
steer clear of the temptation to take on too many tasks
and]{.underline}** instead **[enhance resilience only in areas that can
be reconciled with its mandate as a security and defense
alliance]{.underline}**. **[The encounter with illiberal powers
strengthens NATO's unity, but that does not necessarily mean that NATO
is the right institution to meet the illiberal challenges that Russia
and China pose]{.underline}**. So far, **[the alliance's record of
responding to these threats has been uneven]{.underline}**, and the
**[perspectives about its role have diverged]{.underline}** at times
**[between]{.underline}** the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its European partners]{.underline}**.
But there is a way forward, **[if NATO can clearly delineate what should
and should not fall within its remit, be clear-eyed about its strategic
environment]{.underline}**, and prioritize international partners that
share NATO's interests and values. Containing Russia, Watching China
NATO's adaptation to Russia's revisionist foreign policy has so far
focused mostly on the military threat that the country poses. In
response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO enhanced its
capacity for rapid reaction and placed multinational battlegroups in
Poland and each of the Baltic states as a "tripwire" to remind Russia of
NATO's collective defense guarantee. In response to Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NATO will likely aim to demonstrate its
ability and resolve to repel an attack by Russia's forces stationed near
allied territory by improving its reinforcement capability to deter
major Russian military buildups like the one around Ukraine. NATO
already boosted its existing forward deployments, while the rise in
European defense expenditure will enable the alliance to shoulder a
broader deterrence effort. Conversely, NATO has not fully found its
foothold when it comes to Russia's political warfare, by which it has
attempted to diminish the alliance's ability to act cohesively. The
digital age has enhanced the opportunities for Russia to engage in
information and psychological warfare, including hack-and-leak
operations to influence and discredit elections. The polarization of the
political landscapes on both sides of the Atlantic over the past decade
has made countries more receptive to Russian disinformation and
narratives seeking to discredit the democratic process. Moreover,
Russian assassination and sabotage operations on NATO territory have
contributed to a public sense of vulnerability to heavy-handed
authoritarian methods and doubt about the coping power of democratic
institutions. China does not compare to the direct threat that Russia
poses but has nevertheless appeared on NATO's strategic radar as an
economic great power with a high-tech edge that Russia is unlikely to
ever match. Chinese 5G network provider Huawei remains a pertinent topic
for NATO, as several European countries, including Germany, Austria,
Spain, the Netherlands and Hungary, are still undecided about relying on
its potentially compromised technology or de facto allowing their
national operators to use Chinese providers. Moreover, Chinese
investments in continental Europe without conditionalities attached and
targeting critical infrastructure (railway stations, ports and airports)
raise suspicions about Beijing's underlying political and military
motives. Moreover, China is pressing ahead with military applications of
artificial intelligence (AI), and its space ambitions are growing. Since
2014, NATO has become increasingly aware of the nonmilitary challenges
to its unity and resilience but has adapted only in certain respects. It
adopted the so-called baseline requirements in 2016, against which it
can measure individual allies' level of resilience regarding their
provision of essential services to their domestic populations. These
basics that would be necessary to withstand a crisis include access to
food, water and energy supplies; maintenance of core functions of
government; and resilient civil transportation systems. However, the
baseline requirements are technical measurements that do not adequately
grasp the political nature of the challenges that Russia and China pose
to alliance unity. Moreover, their focus on civil preparedness, resource
management and infrastructure does not seem to fit squarely within the
competencies of a defense alliance. NATO may be on a slippery slope with
the scope of its resilience concept drifting further away from its
defense capabilities. **[NATO,]{.underline}** as an organization and as
an alliance of states, **[is aware of the challenges to transatlantic
resilience and cohesion that Russia and China pose, but the alliance has
not been able to agree on the issues to which it can bring added
value]{.underline}**. The situation today stands **[in contrast
to]{.underline}** the situation during **[the Cold War when NATO
successfully calibrated resilience to the ability to resist an armed
attack]{.underline}** by focusing on civil emergency planning. Russia
and China are illiberal challengers that add new meaning to
transatlantic security cooperation, but **[NATO's adaptation will depend
on the extent to which the United States and Europe can find agreement
on investment in transatlantic security]{.underline}**.

**[confidence]{.underline}** **[in the Alliance among its member
states]{.underline}**, including Canada, **[represents a]{.underline}**
**[threat to this cohesion]{.underline}**. A proposal to withdraw Canada
from NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's
three major political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it
represents a fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left;
if left unaddressed, such a narrative could grow.

**[If countries like Russia perceive NATO as an]{.underline}**
**[atomized collection of states]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
**[varied priorities]{.underline}** **[rather than a unified

believe they can]{.underline}** **[cross a red line]{.underline}**
**[and only face]{.underline}** a **[limited response]{.underline}**.
Thus, **[gaps in cohesion]{.underline}** **[within the

**[Who's in charge?]{.underline}** Multiple allies felt taken by
surprise by the advanced nature of the thinking that went into NATO's
military strategy. When General Dunford remarked in May 2019 that NATO
now had, for the first time 'in decades', a military strategy that
'clearly articulates the challenges that confront NATO' and 'provides
the framework for the various plans that will be in place if deterrence
fails', he highlighted not only the benefits of an enhanced framework
for military planning but also, inadvertently, the political
shortcomings of the Alliance's strategic leadership.30 Some allies felt
a need to push back. Tellingly, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and]{.underline}** the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom were not among them.
American and British military authorities had **[led the
charge]{.underline}** and considered both **[the new military strategy
and the]{.underline}** derivative **[theatre-wide DDA]{.underline}** as
having been politically approved and ready to go.31 **[Other
allies]{.underline}**, however, **[continue to have reservations with
regard to the Russia-centric nature of the strategy]{.underline}**, and
attach importance to a subtle distinction whereby they have merely
'noted' the military strategy but explicitly 'approved' the DDA. In
fact, **[these allies have sought to contain the 2019 military
strategy]{.underline}** and to control the 2020 DDA-led process. As
noted, they have arrested the overarching threat assessment, pushing for
an upgrade of the role of the southern flank. **[A revised Strategic
Concept will have to find a way to balance between Russia-related
collective defence and southern]{.underline}** counter-terrorism and
**[capacity-building]{.underline}**. For now, the southern flank has won
a stronger foothold in the DDA, which henceforth will contain a
Sequenced Response Plan -- which is comparable to the Russia-centric
Graduated Response Plans -- to address southern contingencies. This is
merely a warm-up for a grander political debate, however. A wide variety
of allies continue to insist that SACEUR must base theatre- wide DDA
planning on compartmentalised Graduated Response Plans.
Compartmentalised planning stifles military agility, but allies like to
have NATO plans for their particular neighbourhoods and, moreover, the
ability to leverage these plans to control SACEUR's otherwise free rein
within a 360-degree approach to NATO's theatre of operations. Put
differently, they are not about to hand SACEUR a mandate to steer the
type of 'horizontal escalation' that is baked into the theatre-wide
approach. Allies are also in control of force investment, and hence the
development of the kind of ready and robust forces on which NATO plans
depend. In short, SACEUR may possess a stellar military strategy, but he
is limited to planning for the simultaneous activation of just two
response plans at any one time, and has too few ready and capable troops
on which to call. The traumatic retreat from Afghanistan in August 2021
could ultimately enhance political--military coherence and empower
SACEUR's work with the DDA, though the full implications of the
withdrawal remain unclear at the time of writing. The retreat suffered
from a lack of allied coordination and exposed the heralded NATO
principle of 'in together, out together' as cover for US-driven
planning. European allies found that they could regret the lack of
political coordination and harbour different plans, but ultimately
lacked the capabilities to resist or influence US policy. The
Afghanistan retreat has thus ignited a new, probing debate on
transatlantic burden- sharing that can be expected to give the Strategic
Concept process a kind of unpredictable energy. What is clear is that
European allies who worry about a hard-nosed turn in US policy -- as
exemplified by Trump's sweeping critique of NATO allies and now the
Biden administration's actions in Afghanistan -- must give thought to
their own defence efforts at a level that extends far beyond the
intricacies of NATO's requirement that allies spend 2% of GDP on defence
(a 2014 measure intended to increase European spending). Rebalancing
NATO has become an issue that the Strategic Concept cannot ignore, but
rather must define and build on. NATO has advanced military planning (MC
400/4 and the DDA) to help this process along, and no doubt SACEUR and
other military authorities are hopeful that it will result in more
confident political engagement with the terms of allied defence and
deterrence, including the resourcing of a more robust European force
contribution. To achieve this type of greater political--military
coherence, NATO's leadership must offer a corrected transatlantic vision
of collective defence that explicitly delineates core lessons from
Afghanistan and their implications for a rebalanced NATO. Political
revival, but how? **[Allies have]{.underline}** until now been catching
up, having **[been taken by surprise]{.underline}** firstly by
forward-leaning military authorities, and then **[by the
speed]{.underline}** with which **[Stoltenberg moved to put a revised
Strategic Concept on the Alliance's agenda]{.underline}**. In late
November 2020, in the wake of the US presidential election, Stoltenberg
stated that 'the time has come to update our strategic concept'.32 A few
days later, a Reflection Group appointed by the secretary-general
likewise concluded that 'NATO must update the 2010 Strategic Concept'.33
In February 2021, the secretary-general offered his condensed view of
the Reflection Group's conclusions, writing in his 'Food for Thought
Paper': 'At the 2021 Summit, Leaders should agree to update the
Strategic Concept' and 'should adopt a tasking for me to lead the
process' with a view to concluding it in 2022.34 The leaders duly did so
in Brussels on 14 June.35 **[The need for political reform had been
signalled]{.underline}** by the trauma of the divisive 2018 Brussels
Summit; the decision to celebrate NATO's 70th anniversary in April 2019
at the level of foreign ministers, rather than heads of state and
government; the intensifying disagreement on how NATO should respond to
crises in its vicinity, not least in Syria; and finally French President
Emmanuel Macron's November 2019 characterisation of NATO as 'brain
dead'.36 When NATO heads of state and government met in London in
December 2019 not for a summit but for a quick Leaders Meeting -- this
being all they could handle -- they readily agreed to 'invite' the
secretary-general to steer a 'reflection process' to 'further strengthen
NATO's political dimension'.37 Still, the speed with which Stoltenberg
enlarged this reflection process into a 'NATO 2030' agenda, his bold
leap in demanding a revised Strategic Concept, and his equally bold
decision to push his February 2021 'Food for Thought Paper' into the
public arena were all surprisingly out of character. Stoltenberg had
been decisive in helping NATO weather the storm unleashed by Trump, but
as a consensus builder who worked behind the scenes while keeping up
public appearances. Now, and for good reason, he was charging ahead.
**[The distinct risk of this charge is that it will add to NATO's
political-- military tensions.]{.underline}** Stoltenberg's London
mandate, and therefore the work of the Reflection Group, was entirely
political: there was no built-in requirement to seek political--military
coherence. Moreover, even if **[Stoltenberg]{.underline}** has so far
confined the Strategic Concept debate to the headquarters of the North
Atlantic Council, thereby avoiding extensive committee work and
negotiations, he **[will not be able to imitate Rasmussen's tightly
controlled process]{.underline}** **[in 2010]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[NATO leaders have stipulated that while the secretary-general should
'lead' the Strategic Concept process, the text 'will be
negotiated]{.underline}** and agreed by the Council in Permanent Session
and endorsed by NATO Leaders at the next Summit'.38 **[The upside is
that allied buy-in will increase compared with 2010 and
thereafter]{.underline}**. **[The downside is]{.underline}** that the
**[temptation to be expansive in terms of priorities]{.underline}**
**[could grow]{.underline}**. The 2020 Reflection Group, steered by the
secretary- general, notably did not call for the slimming of
**[NATO]{.underline}**'s core tasks.39 In a bid to build a consensus,
**[the secretary-general may feel tempted to lengthen the list of core
tasks,]{.underline}** perhaps **[by adding]{.underline}** resilience,
**[disruptive technology]{.underline}**, pandemics and natural
disasters. This temptation will be all the stronger given that, in the
meantime, NATO has decided to 'mainstream' the challenges posed by China
into the Alliance's many policy portfolios.40 In short, **[NATO is
approaching a revised]{.underline}** **[Strategic Concept
with]{.underline}**, **[on the one hand,]{.underline}** **[a political
temptation to go big and, on the other, a Russia-centric approach to
military planning]{.underline}**. To steer clear of further
political--military tensions and even rupture, NATO allies should 1)
prioritise collective defence; 2) develop a values-based narrative; and
3) intensify its internal political--military dialogue.

After rocky relations with the Trump administration, **[NATO will be
keen to project unity]{.underline}** at its summit beginning Monday.
Media reporting will pay close attention to how other leaders welcome
Joe Biden to his first NATO summit as president ---
**[and]{.underline}** whether he can start to deliver on a pledge to
"repair our alliances." Here's some equally significant news:
**[NATO]{.underline}** is likely to **[formally launch the update of
its]{.underline}** Strategic Concept for the first time since 2009. The
**[Strategic Concept]{.underline}**, which articulates how NATO
implements the principles of its 1949 founding treaty, has gone through
seven iterations. During the Cold War, the alliance produced four
classified versions, plus there have been three public ones since the
fall of the Berlin Wall (1991, 1999 and 2010). This is **[a core text
that spells out NATO's]{.underline}** "enduring **[purpose and nature,
and its fundamental security tasks"]{.underline}** --- but there's no
road map to determine when the alliance should update its Strategic
Concept. Our research, though, identifies the three major conditions
that need to be present before NATO initiates this key review
exercise. 1. Changes in the international security landscape The
Strategic Concept operationalizes the alliance's goals and tasks. As
such, one would expect that major changes in the international security
environment would prompt a revision of the document. The relationship
between such shifts and the review, however, is more nuanced. Biden's in
Europe to reassure nervous allies. When does reassurance work? Changes
in the security environment can contribute to a "widespread feeling \...
it is time to take stock" among NATO allies, but they don't necessarily
immediately result in a new Strategic Concept. The lag is not
unexpected. After all, an alliance with 30 members needs time to digest
these changes and their implications. Moreover, **[member]{.underline}**
countrie**[s]{.underline}** **[often have divergent threat
perceptions]{.underline}**. A major security shock can cause conflicting
interpretations --- that's what happened in the aftermath of the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attacks. NATO had to overcome disagreements about
the nature and causes of terrorism, and it issued a new Strategic
Concept nine years later. 2. Consensus on NATO's current
responsibilities Although a new Strategic Concept is "useful but not
essential" when it comes to NATO's day-to-day operations, the document
does play a formal codifying role. NATO is a versatile organization,
able over time to organically take on new tasks. And, once the alliance
has taken on sufficient new responsibilities since the previous
strategic review, it becomes easier to justify starting a new process;
what one senior official called "akin to doing the vacuum cleaning." At
the same time, **[launching the revision process requires NATO
to]{.underline}** **[navigate delicate internal and external
hurdles]{.underline}**. **[Strategic Concepts are acts of public
diplomacy]{.underline}** and a key way to highlight NATO's continued
relevance. **[A high-level strategic review can exacerbate existing
tensions among NATO members]{.underline}**, **[running the risk
of]{.underline}** revealing a **[lack of unity about]{.underline}** the
future of **[the alliance as opposed to bolstering
consensus]{.underline}** around key security challenges. The U.S. and
NATO promised to protect Ukraine. If Ukraine is the aggressor, all bets
are off. For example, NATO faces perennial questions about its raison
d'etre, be it at the end of the Cold War or in the late 2000s, with its
struggles in Afghanistan. Debates in the mid-2000s about a "Global
NATO," and how this shift would affect the core task of defense of the
transatlantic area, delayed the push toward a new Strategic Concept
during the George W. Bush administration, despite the impact of 9/11. 3.
Leaders who push for a strategic review **[Summoning the will for a
major review isn't an easy feat]{.underline}** for an alliance with 30
members --- **[often it takes senior decision-makers to push for
consensus to move forward]{.underline}**. Revising the Strategic Concept
implies disrupting the day-to-day work of the alliance **[and overcoming
bureaucratic inertia]{.underline}**. **[It is also a complex political
process that diverts precious resources away from fulfilling NATO's
existing mandates]{.underline}**. **[Considering the political
sensitivity of the Strategic Concept, only very senior officials can
realistically take on the role of overcoming organizational
reticence]{.underline}**. **[Sometimes it takes a leader from a member
country to push hard,]{.underline}** as German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
representing a broader coalition, did in 2006 when she called for a new
Strategic Concept. But NATO secretary generals have also taken on
ambitious and entrepreneurial roles. Thus, Secretary General Jaap de
Hoop Scheffer was a strong advocate for updating the Strategic Concept
in the late 2000s, seeking a crowning achievement for when his term
ended in 2009. Here's the outlook in 2021 All three conditions are
present, which helps explain why NATO is about to begin the process to
draft its eighth version of the Strategic Concept. The security
landscape has changed significantly since 2010, and the alliance has
already taken steps to adapt, be it bolstering its military readiness to
deter Russia or acknowledging China as a new challenge. Moreover, the
new **[Biden]{.underline}** administration **[is more pro-NATO
than]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration was,
while French President Emmanuel Macron's November 2019 criticism about
NATO becoming "brain dead" put pressure on the alliance to demonstrate
its continued relevance. And global leaders, along with NATO, have
openly pushed for a new Strategic Concept. Germany rapidly proposed,
soon after Macron's comments, the establishment of an expert group to
rejuvenate NATO, an idea embraced by Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary
general since 2014. NATO members also endorsed this plan when they met
in London in December 2019. The eventual expert report, along with the
wider consultations initiated by the secretary general as part of the
NATO 2030 initiative, have helped to build consensus for the next
Strategic Concept. What happens now? In a bid to show renewed unity,
NATO members are widely expected to launch a revision process of the
Strategic Concept at the summit Monday. But **[achieving consensus on a
number of]{.underline}** **[issues will be challenging]{.underline}**.
Defining NATO's role toward China, and the alliance's mandate on
democratic resilience and climate change, are two areas in particular
where alliance members will struggle to find agreement.

**[[Nato is proposing a new tech innovation
centre]{.underline}]{.mark}** bringing together military personnel with
industry to foster digital defence start-ups. Some of these might be
financed by a separate initiative, also set to be debated: a venture
capital fund for innovation **[[which]{.mark} member [states
could]{.mark} choose to [opt in to]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The
efforts are belated,]{.underline}]{.mark}** as Nato secretary-general
Jens Stoltenberg himself acknowledged. "For decades, Nato allies have
been leading when it comes to technology, but that's not obvious any
more," he told the Financial Times in an interview last week. "We see
China especially investing heavily in new, **[[disruptive
tech]{.mark}nologies [like a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence,
[autonomous systems, big data,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and they implement
them into new advanced weapon systems, drones, submarines, aircraft and
so on." He is not the first to sound the alarm. Eric Schmidt, the former
Google chief executive who now chairs the US's National Security
Commission on AI, warned earlier this year that Beijing was planning to
undermine conventional military forces by "leapfrogging" to new
technologies. The commission's report, published in March, raised
concerns that China would use AI for "reconnaissance, electromagnetic
countermeasures and co-ordinated firepower strikes". Part of the problem
is that **[[western defence institutions have been slow to
recognise]{.mark} the potential of [innovation beyond their own
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "**[[For
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a lot of
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological **[[development would happen
within the defence sector]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the internet,
nuclear, GPS, all of that was developed by the defence industry and
**[[then shared with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[civilian]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector," Stoltenberg said. "**[[Now,
it goes the other way]{.mark} around]{.underline}**. It's a
**[[civilian]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector which **[[is
leading]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the development of
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, **[[quantum computing,
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** many of the new **[[disruptive
tech]{.mark}nologies."]{.underline}** Some Nato members are ahead of
others. The US and France have published military AI strategies, while
the UK announced this year that it is to establish a centre for defence
AI. For the first time, Britain's intelligence agency, MI6, is
recruiting from the private sector for a new head of its "Q" branch ---
the technical lab made famous in the James Bond films. Establishing a
new Nato hub --- known as an "accelerator" --- in which tech companies
and members of the armed forces can experiment with new ideas has
advantages, according to Professor Fiona Murray, co-director of MIT's
innovation initiative. Start-ups and investors do not always have the
time to tackle defence challenges when solutions are "hard to test,
markets are fragmented and procurement is slow", Murray said. Working
together would create a wider market for new products and enhance
collective security, she noted. It was "not enough" for countries to be
handling this individually, she said. The US has started marshalling
allies on the policy implications of using new technology. The
Pentagon's "AI Partnership for Defense", comprising 13 countries
(including Nato members Canada, Denmark, Estonia, the UK, France and
Norway) met virtually for the first time last year to agree joint
military standards on AI. Schmidt's commission has called on the Five
Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance (the US, UK, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand) to work more closely on developing AI systems. Ulrike
Franke, an expert in military technology at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, argues that Nato's tech centre will be most effective
if it prioritises systems designed to facilitate joint military
operations. The alliance should look at areas such as AI-enabled command
and control, she said, which could give members a unified picture of the
battlefield across multiple regions, using intelligent data analysis to
sift information. **[[Franke said]{.underline}]{.mark}** that in the
vast arena spanning drones to quantum computing**[[, there was a
temptation to cover too much]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "It makes massive
sense for Nato to look more at this \[technology\]", she said. "**[[The
question is, what]{.mark} exactly [are they focusing on? There's a
danger of Nato spreading itself too thin.]{.mark}"]{.underline}**

agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-us-taliban-peace-deal-signing/2020/02/29/b952fb04-5a67-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_1)
and when to withdraw the remaining forces from Afghanistan. The change
in approach by Washington comes as the 72-year-old military alliance
looks to find its footing after a tumultuous four years dealing with
Trump. The challenges are vast --- from defending against Russia,
evolving to consider threats posed by China, and extricating forces from
Afghanistan without prompting a collapse of the nation's NATO-backed
government and military force. Senior U.S. defense officials, in a
briefing with reporters, signaled that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
wouldn't offer any U.S. decisions on Afghanistan at the virtual two-day
NATO meeting for defense ministers that begins Wednesday, as the Biden
administration reviews its policy ahead of a May 1 deadline for the full
withdrawal of U.S. troops set out in the [peace
agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-us-taliban-peace-deal/2020/02/29/e63e062c-5a67-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4).
The senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss
the thinking of Pentagon leaders ahead of the NATO meeting, underscored
that violence must be reduced in Afghanistan and said the Biden
administration was reviewing the peace agreement in particular. One of
the senior officials said the Taliban's compliance with the deal ---
which U.S. officials have criticized --- would be a key part of the
review. "It will play into how our government comes to a conclusion on
where we should go," one of the senior defense officials said, noting
that the United States looked forward to consulting with NATO allies on
the issue in the days and weeks to come. The deliberations within the
U.S. government over Afghanistan come as NATO faces an array of
challenges, including in Iraq, where a NATO training and advisory
mission, welcomed by the Biden administration, has continued amid
attacks that Iraqi and Western officials have blamed on Iran-backed
militias. On Monday night, coalition forces in Irbil were struck in an
[attack](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraq-irbil-rocket-attack/2021/02/15/2ab13236-6fd7-11eb-93be-c10813e358a2_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9)
that left a civilian contractor dead and a U.S. service member injured.
Other challenges await: Russia is launching increasingly sophisticated
cyber campaigns, including the most recent SolarWinds hack. Turkey, a
NATO member, is blocking work and picking fights inside the alliance.
And the United States, according to the senior U.S. defense officials,
wants NATO to put China on its priority list. Most notable at this
week's meeting is likely to be the change in style by the new U.S.
administration toward its fellow NATO members. **[Trump often
threatened]{.underline}** **[NATO allies about]{.underline}** **[their
defense spending]{.underline}** and used a bullying approach that led
some world leaders to [mock
him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/nato-braces-for-contentious-summit-as-trump-other-leaders-gather-near-london/2019/12/04/5994d97c-0fc0-11ea-924c-b34d09bbc948_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_13)
and his freewheeling news conferences. But at NATO, worries about
Washington extended beyond Trump's tone. European diplomats said they
would sometimes wake up at 3 a.m. to check Trump's Twitter feed to see
if he had announced a sudden shift in U.S. military posture. They would
spend weeks carefully laying out strategic plans with lower-level U.S.
officials, only to have everything upended by a new pronouncement from
the Oval Office. Sometimes, U.S. officials would come to them to try to
find ways to work around Trump's anger toward the alliance. President
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[said he [will take a far
different]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[approach to
NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and has [gone out
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[his way to signal support for the
alliance]{.underline}**]{.mark}, including by recording a video of a
friendly phone call to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg last
month. After Austin became defense secretary, the Pentagon scheduled
Stoltenberg as his first call, and **[Biden has]{.underline}**
**[already halted a partial withdrawal]{.underline}** **[of U.S.
troops]{.underline}** from Germany that Trump ordered, as the Pentagon
evaluates what forces should be stationed where. Some four weeks into
the new administration, NATO diplomats are still sorting out the rules
of the game inside the glassy alliance headquarters in Brussels. Trump's
ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is gone, replaced for now by
her former deputy, Chargé d'Affaires Douglas Jones. Biden has yet to
announce his nominee for the post. One significant shift so far,
**[diplomats said]{.underline}**, is that **[the]{.underline}**
**[[Biden]{.mark} administration]{.underline}** [**[appears interested
in hearing the]{.underline}** **[views of allies on
issues]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[including operations]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** **[Afghanistan]{.underline}**, where in addition to
[2,500 U.S.
troops](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-us-troop-drawdown/2021/01/15/9396553c-5737-11eb-acc5-92d2819a1ccb_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_19),
8,000 forces from allied and partner nations remain. Earlier this month,
officials from the White House, State Department and Pentagon joined a
conference call with NATO ambassadors, who detailed their countries'
positions on deployments and the security situation. A number of
diplomats said it was a departure from Trump-era practice --- and that
they were delighted. Stoltenberg signaled his eagerness to move on from
the acrimony of the Trump era. "**[It's no secret that
over]{.underline}** **[the last four years, we had some]{.underline}**
**[difficult discussions inside NATO]{.underline}**, **[but now we look
to the future]{.underline}**," he told reporters Monday ahead of the
defense ministers' meeting. "And the future is that we now have an
administration in the United States, in Washington, which is strongly
committed to the transatlantic bond, to NATO, to Europe and North
America working together." One of the senior U.S. defense officials
underscored the point on Tuesday. "**[[Consultation is really kind of
the name of the game here]{.underline}]{.mark}**," the official said,
describing the expected tone of the meeting. **[The task of repairing
the U.S. relationship]{.underline}** with members of the alliance is
significant, after some policymakers said their bandwidth was consumed
by catering to Trump's whims and acting as if he hadn't upended the
military organization. "**[The level of anxiety is still]{.underline}**
**[high after four years of]{.underline}** **[trauma]{.underline}**," a
senior NATO diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to
discuss internal alliance conversations. **["It's been four years
of]{.underline}** **[denial]{.underline}** **[and sort of]{.underline}**
**[faking things, repeating over and over again, 'This is a strong NATO,
we can become even stronger]{.underline}**.' "

### AT: NATO AI Now

#### NATO limiting leadership and active implementation of AI mechanisms now \-\-- has shifted development to private industries and adoption to individual countries

**Burt '21**

(Peter, "NATO\'s new AI strategy: lacking in substance and lacking in
leadership," pg online @
<https://natowatch.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/briefing_88_nato_ai_strategy.pdf>
//um-ef)

**[NATO\'s ethical principles for the responsible use of
AI,]{.underline}** though welcome, **[raise several
issues]{.underline}**. Such statements of principle are now commonplace
in the corporate sector and are increasingly being adopted by
governments on both a unilateral and multilateral basis. **[NATO\'s
principles are similar to principles adopted by the US Department of
Defense for the ethical use of AI]{.underline}**: indeed, in some places
the wording is the same as that in the Department of Defense principles.
**[As with many such statements of principle, the NATO principles have
no coherent means of implementation or enforcement]{.underline}**.
**[Their successful adoption will]{.underline}** in many ways **[depend
upon leadership and political and military culture]{.underline}**,
**[which is different in each of NATO\'s 30 member
states]{.underline}**. **[Will Turkey]{.underline}**, for example,
**[which has been a keen proponent of automated warfare]{.underline}**
**[and by some accounts]{.underline}** has **[already developed AI-based
loitering munitions with an autonomous capability]{.underline}** to
identify targets, **[be willing to follow the same rules as the
USA?]{.underline}** And would the USA under a second Trump
administration follow the same rules as a Biden administration? **[In
the absence of any binding enforcement mechanism NATO\'s principles may
provide useful for public relations purposes but are likely to be less
useful in preventing harm to humans]{.underline}**, particularly those
in the Global South who are already in situations of conflict, and
historically marginalised groups. Despite the plethora of corporate
statements on ethical principles, those working in the tech sector are
sceptical about the prospect that ethical AI design will be adopted as a
norm over the next decade. A non-random poll conducted by the Pew
Research Centre in early 2021 found that 68% of experts in the field
thought that ethical principles focused primarily on the public good
will not be employed in most AI systems by 2030. Their concerns
recognised that the main developers and deployers of AI are focused on
profit-seeking and social control, and that global competition will
matter more to the development of AI than any ethical issues. This
latter factor will very much influence NATO\'s future adoption of AI.
Although NATO\'s ethical AI principles are stated to have been developed
on the basis of "Allied approaches and relevant work in applicable
international fora", it is not clear whether they draw on views from the
wide range of professional disciplines necessary to develop a
representative and rounded view of the ethical pitfalls and risks
associated for AI, or from a diversity of perspectives. **[There has
certainly been no open consultation on their formulation]{.underline}**,
4 **[and it is possible that the principles may only represent the
perceptions of a relatively narrow range of predominantly white male
technocrats and military planners drawn from within NATO, member
governments]{.underline}** (notably the USA), **[and the arms
industry]{.underline}**. Ordinary people, particularly marginalised
groups and those in the Global South, will ultimately face the
consequences and impacts of NATO\'s decisions on AI systems, yet the
public have certainly not been involved in making decisions on this
strategy, which will set the framework for NATO\'s future AI choices.
NATO\'s AI strategy does not discuss the development of AI-driven
autonomous weapon systems -- a significant omission, given the ethical
issues that this application of AI would raise and the challenges to
human rights that such weapons would pose. As a bare minimum, the
strategy could---and should---have endorsed the \'Guiding Principles\'
on emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons which
have recently been adopted by consensus by High Contracting Parties to
the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). **[Despite
increasing pressure for a ban on the development and use of lethal
autonomous weapons, key NATO states including the USA and UK have been
lukewarm about the need for a ban]{.underline}**, **[arguing that
current laws of war are adequate]{.underline}** to regulate any such
weapons. This seems optimistic, given the rapid development of AI
technology and the push by some states over recent years to redefine the
rules that govern use of armed force to suit their own purposes. **[To
date no NATO member states have supported the call for a ban on lethal
autonomous weapons]{.underline}**. **[If NATO members were serious about
ensuring that]{.underline}** the military use of AI adheres to
international humanitarian law and human rights law, **[they would call
for and engage in negotiations on a legally binding
instrument]{.underline}** on autonomous weapons systems at the CCW;
which is expected to take a historic decision on this issue at its
Review Conference in December 2021. **[Investment and innovation in
artificial intelligence is being led by the private sector, and not by
the world's militaries]{.underline}**. Recognising this**[, NATO\'s AI
strategy places a premium on engaging with "start-ups, innovative small
and medium enterprises, and academic researchers that either have not
considered working on defence and security solutions, or simply find the
adoption pathways too slow or restrictive]{.underline}** for their
business models". NATO wants to "make defence and security a more
attractive sector for civilian innovators to partner with". Aiming to
capture the civilian tech sector in this way risks increasing the
influence of the military-industrialpolitical complex to an even greater
extent than is already the case. Will this really help advance NATO\'s
liberal and democratic values? Conclusion Although **[NATO\'s AI
strategy]{.underline}** contains a few worthwhile nuggets, on balance
**[it is tame and unambitious]{.underline}**. It is depressingly clear
that NATO sees AI as basically another way of using technology to wage
war more effectively, **[and is not willing to show any real
leadership]{.underline}** to mitigate the risks that AI poses to human
rights and dignity. War is, after all, the highest area of risk when it
comes to the potential for human rights abuses, yet NATO\'s strategy
says nothing about measures to effectively govern military AI and
autonomous weapon systems. AI has the potential to help humanity tackle
intractable \'wicked problems\' such as climate change and unsustainable
development, and tackle the course of dangerous behaviour which is
threatening the survival of our species. But this will only happen if it
is employed under wise and decisive human leadership, otherwise it may
dramatically compound the problems we face, threatening international
security and human rights even more. **[NATO]{.underline}**,
unfortunately, **[seems unwilling to provide that
leadership]{.underline}**. Acknowledgement: The author would like to

The strategic surge in EDTs is driven by the accelerated investment
towards the military adoption and innovation of EDTs and maintaining a
sustainable innovation ecosystem that can be achieved through
civil--military collaboration. In 2021, **[NATO endorsed the strategy on
EDTs that included AI and machine learning]{.underline}** among the
seven identified key technologies (Data, AI, Autonomy, Quantum, Space,
Biotechnology, and Hypersonic).6 **[The strategy plans to invest US\$ 1
billion in building test centres across Europe and North America,

In the NATO Summit held at Brussels **[in 2021]{.underline}**, as a part
of the NATO 2030 Agenda, NATO's new Defence Innovation Accelerator for

technological edge compared to nations like China and
Russia]{.underline}**, which are challenging the West with their
accelerated investments to build technological capacity and use
offensive subversive measures.

**[DIANA has been assigned to manage the NATO Innovation
Fund]{.underline}**, receiving a funding of US\$ 82.6 million a year for
15 years.8 It will explore the future roadmap of implementation of
advanced technologies and competition to foster transatlantic
cooperation.9 At present, there are 10 accelerator sites with more than
50 test centres in technological hubs across the states.10 The NATO
advisory group on EDTs is an external body that advises NATO on the
optimisation of its innovation efforts. **[This group provides
recommendations on improving collaboration and partnerships with the

### Uniq \-\-- Cohesion/Focus Now

#### Russia's invasion of Ukraine reinvigorates NATO cohesion, but it's not guaranteed if they don't focus on Russia.

Russian President Vladimir **[Putin's invasion of Ukraine has
reinvigorated the Western alliance and bolstered transatlantic
solidarity.]{.underline}** After being declared "brain dead" by French
President Emmanuel Macron in 2019, **[NATO has sprung to
life]{.underline}**, **[deploying forces to its eastern flank and
coordinating the provision of sophisticated weapons that have helped
Ukraine impede Russia's invasion]{.underline}**. For the first time in
its history, the European Union has financed the purchase and delivery
of lethal aid. Western countries have vastly exceeded expectations in
implementing coordinated financial sanctions that have crippled Russia's
economy. Even neutral Switzerland joined the fray. But **[no matter how
remarkable this solidarity may be in the short term, there is no
guarantee that it will last: if policymakers are complacent, powerful
trends predating the Ukraine crisis could overwhelm and ultimately
derail it.]{.underline}** Protectionist sentiment and self-defeating
trade wars have pulled at the seams of Western economic integration.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to pull out of NATO and the
chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 have chipped away at
military trust between the United States and Europe. A Marine Le Pen
victory later this month in France would pose additional challenges to
the alliance, and looming concerns about the 2024 presidential election
raise doubts about the United States' commitment. **[If not managed
intelligently, the reawakening of Europe as a diplomatic and military
actor]{.underline}** and the reexamination of global economic
interdependence **[catalyzed by Russia's invasion could result not in a
strengthened transatlantic alliance but in a more worrying outcome: the
emergence of three distinct blocs, one centered around the United
States, a second around Europe, and a third around China]{.underline}**
(which would include Russia). Such a world---with the United States and
Europe often collaborating, but also at odds when their interests
diverge---would make the management of China and Russia more difficult,
as the two would have opportunities to trigger and exploit U.S.-European
tensions. It would also represent a major missed opportunity for the
United States and Europe.

not Cold War bases but rather the forward operating stations of the U.S.

Middle East and Africa. But they primarily serve as a bulwark: NATO is
not global in its scope, scale or ambition and will remain tightly
focused on the North Atlantic.

warfare]{.underline}**, **[most]{.underline}**
**[observers]{.underline}** **[would agree with Winston Churchill
that]{.underline}** "**[there is only one thing worse than fighting with
allies, and that is fighting without them]{.underline}**." The greatest
single advantage the U.S. has on the global stage is our network of
allies, partners and friends. That network is under deliberate pressure:
from China, with its "One Belt, One Road" competitive strategy, and from
Russia, with its relentless attacks on coalition unity. A strong NATO
means not only having allies in a fight, should it come to that, but
also a powerful deterrent to the aggression of ambitious adversaries.

Perhaps NATO's greatest accomplishment is not even its unblemished
record of deterring attack against its members but rather the fact that
**[no alliance nation has ever attacked another.]{.underline}**
**[NATO's most fundamental deliverable has been peace among Europe's
major powers for 70 years]{.underline}** **[after two millennia of
unhesitating slaughter on the continent]{.underline}**. The disasters of
the 20th century alone pulled the U.S. into two world wars that killed
more than half a million Americans.

Eric thanks 4rsland

At the start of the war, western leaders rallied behind a sanctions
regime to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin. But months later,
how to bring the war to an end --- and potentially end the sanctions
that are helping drive inflation --- have led to strain.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Kyiv for the second
time last week, has positioned himself as a top ally of Zelensky and
insists Ukraine "must win." French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile,
has warned against "humiliating" Russia. And along with German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, he has maintained open channels of communication
with the Kremlin.

That has sometimes put them at odds with Biden, who accused Putin of
genocide and war crimes while also saying -- at the end of his last
visit to Europe -- that he "cannot remain in power." Biden's Defense
secretary said after his own visit to Ukraine that Russia must be
"weakened."

**[[Biden]{.mark}'s [aides]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[insist the unity
he's worked hard to cultivate remains intact]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Uniq \-\-- Unity Now

#### Summit invites cohesion and determination from a united NATO

**VOV 22**, News site, 6/23/22, "German Chancellor expect NATO's
cohesion and determination," *VOV World,*

JH

(VOVWORLD) - **[[German Chancellor]{.mark} Olaf Scholz]{.underline}** on
Wednesday spoke to parliament about the **[upcoming European Union, G7,
and NATO [summits]{.mark}, where he [expects a cohesion and
determination from NATO]{.mark} leaders [on]{.mark} the issue of the
[Ukraine conflict]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

**[He promised that [Germany and Europe will continue to support
Ukraine]{.mark} financially, [politically]{.mark}, and with
weapons]{.underline}**. However, he said, NATO will not become a
combatant and he promised Ukraine a \"Marshall plan\" of long-term
support for reconstruction after the war. **[As G7
President,]{.underline}** **[the [German Chancellor]{.mark} wants to
[convene]{.mark}]{.underline}** an international conference **[[to work
towards an agreement]{.mark} on investments in Ukraine.]{.underline}**

**[Scholz said his goal at the upcoming EU summit is to mobilize EU
members to grant candidate status to Ukraine]{.underline}** and Moldova.
He said the EU needs to set up accession negotiations for Albania and
North Macedonia, and **[he pushed for solutions to the problem of grain
exports from Ukraine and said the German [government]{.mark} is
[coordinating with partners]{.mark}]{.underline}** on measures to
prevent energy shortages this winter.

### Uniq \-\-- Concept = Cohesion

#### Strategic concept proves cohesion

**Lusa** 6/22/**22**, "Portugal: NATO summit will show cohesion between
allies at time of conflict -- military chief," Macau News Agency,
<https://www.macaubusiness.com/portugal-nato-summit-will-show-cohesion-between-allies-at-time-of-conflict-military-chief/>,
JH

The chief of staff of the armed forces (CEMGFA) considered on Tuesday
that the **[NATO [summit]{.mark} will [show "cohesion" between
allies,]{.mark} noting that the [new strategic concept will be
approved]{.mark} at a time of conflict in Europe.]{.underline}**

"**[In military terms, what I can say is that we will have, from the
Madrid summit onwards, [a great demonstration of the strength]{.mark} of
the Atlantic Alliance [in terms of its cohesion]{.mark} and what are the
structuring documents to build]{.underline}** an auspicious future for
this extraordinary alliance which has been extremely relevant in terms
of peace guarantees on the European continent," he said. 

Admiral Silva Ribeiro was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of
the 1st seminar on Innovation in the Armed Forces, organised by the
military general staff (EMGFA) at the Military University Institute in
Lisbon.

**[The CEMGFA [highlighted the importance of this
summit]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- scheduled for 29 and 30 June, in Madrid
-- considering it to be "perhaps one of the most relevant since the
beginning of the 21st century. 

"Insofar as a new strategic concept will be approved that comes at a
time when we have a conflict in Europe and, therefore**[, it is [a
strategic concept]{.mark} that [gives]{.mark} not only a [vision of what
the future of NATO will be]{.mark} but it is [also]{.mark} an extremely
relevant summit [to highlight]{.mark} a [fundamental
aspect]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the functioning of the Atlantic
Alliance, which is cohesion among allies," he added. 

**[When asked if defence should have a larger budget in the next state
budget]{.underline}**, given the context of conflict in Ukraine, Silva
Ribeiro considered that Portugal has made "a progressive path" towards
meeting NATO's goals.

"We are in the process of revising the Military Programming Law, which
provides exactly for the construction of a set of capabilities that will
ensure the achievement of two fundamental objectives: **[[sustaining the
capabilities]{.mark} we have [and filling gaps]{.mark} that we have in
our system of forces so that the military can respond]{.underline}** to
the most likely threats while considering the most dangerous ones," he
added.

The admiral said that NATO countries are "also making an effort to
respond to the Welsh Summit's objective of 2 per cent investment in
defence".

"**[Portugal has been making its way according to what the prime
minister presented at the Brussels summit two years ago]{.underline}**.
There is now going to be a summit in Madrid and so we have to wait for
the political decisions in that regard, but I am convinced that the path
Portugal is following will give peace of mind in terms of what the
investments are, so that the defence and security forces can maintain
their operational capabilities that have performed well abroad," he
said.

When asked by journalists whether he expected the government to invest
more in defence in the next budget, Silva Ribeiro replied that "these
are political decisions", guaranteeing that "the armed forces will carry
out their missions with the dignity and relevance that is customary with
the resources that are placed at their disposal".

### Uniq \-\-- Overstretch Brinks

#### The agenda is already large, but NATO can focus on alliance cohesion -- adding more issues suddenly overstretches the summit.

There have been some ad hoc meetings, but **[this is the first sort of
annual meeting of the year for those two summits]{.underline}**. So it's
a pretty significant trip because, obviously, **[this is a chance to
affirm and bolster U.S. alliances]{.underline}**, to bolster democracy.
I think those are going to be the overarching themes across both
summits. But, obviously, **[there's some pretty significant
headwinds]{.underline}** here. You know, **[you have Ukraine bogged
down. You've got inflation raging, you know, a series of crises from
food to energy to health to climate.]{.underline}** So **[this is going
to be a pretty challenging set of meetings]{.underline}** and I think,
you know, the good news is that President **[Biden has some wind at his
back because he was able to mobilize this group of allies and partners
to take on the Russia-Ukraine challenge initially. But the question is
can he move the ball forward on these two -- at these two
meetings]{.underline}**.

### AT: Turkey hurts cohesion

#### Turkey wants unity

Distinguished Professor at the University of Nevada, 6/23/22, "Unity,
solidarity against common threats key for NATO, Türkiye tells US,"

JH

**[[There must be unity, harmony and solidarity among]{.mark} NATO
[allies]{.mark} against common security and terrorist threats,
[Türkiye's Presidential spokesperson]{.mark} Ibrahim
Kalin]{.underline}** said in a phone call with US National Security
Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday. 

**[[Along with bilateral political and economic ties]{.mark}, the
officials held discussions on [Türkiye's role in NATO and contributions
to the alliance]{.mark}, the upcoming NATO Madrid summit, Sweden and
Finland's NATO bids]{.underline}**, grain shipments through the Black
Sea and other regional issues, according to a statement from the Turkish
presidential spokesperson.

**[They exchanged views on issues on the agenda for next week's NATO
summit, [including its new Strategic Concept]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the
Ukraine war, the fight against terrorism, the global food crisis and
other security issues, the statement said.

**[Kalin emphasized that [NATO allies must have a unified stance against
common security]{.mark} and terrorist threats, [reiterating that Sweden
and Finland must fulfill Türkiye's demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
expectations in the fight against terrorism.

Since Sweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO last month,
Türkiye, a longstanding member of the alliance, has repeatedly voiced
objections over the countries' tolerance, and even support, for
terrorist groups, particularly the PKK terrorist organization.

Kalin stressed that no progress could be made on the matter until Sweden
and Finland take concrete steps.

He underlined that it was unacceptable that PKK/PYD/YPG supporters are
disseminating propaganda in Stockholm and through the media while Ankara
remains engaged in talks with the two Nordic countries.

**[He also conveyed that [Türkiye is continuing negotiations]{.mark}
with Ukraine and Russia on creating a safe corridor for
grain]{.underline}** shipments through the Black Sea.

**[Achieving results from this negotiation process, which includes the
UN, is of strategic importance for global food security]{.underline}**,
he added.

#### Summit eases Turkish tensions

peer-reviewed news magazine covering politics, society, and culture in
the Indo-Pacific region based in Washington, D.C, 6/23/22, "Turkey hosts
panel discussion on NATO to coincide with the Summit," *The Diplomat*,
<https://thediplomatinspain.com/en/2022/06/turkey-hosts-panel-discussion-on-nato-to-coincide-with-the-summit/>,
JH

On Tuesday 28 June from 14:00 to 16:30, the Communications Directorate
of the Presidency of the **[Republic of [Turkey]{.mark} will [host a
panel discussion on 'NATO]{.mark}, from regional to
global]{.underline}**: Dialogue, enlargement and cohesion' at the
Mandarin Oriental Ritz Hotel in Madrid.

Convened at an unfortunate time when Europe is once again experiencing
war after more than half a century, the NATO Alliance, of which Turkey
has been a member for 70 years and Spain for 40, will hold its next
summit from 28-30 June in Madrid, bringing together heads of state and
government from 30 countries. This summit will also adopt the Alliance's
New Strategic Concept in the face of today's security challenges.
**[This [juncture]{.mark} has already [positioned the Madrid Summit
as]{.mark} one of the [most successful]{.mark} and special
[meetings]{.mark} in the Alliance's history.]{.underline}**

The purpose of the panel, which will take place on the above-mentioned
date, is to discuss NATO's capabilities and sphere of influence, to
enable it to intervene effectively in crises other than military ones,
and to debate the strategies to be pursued and the steps to be taken in
the framework of enlargement policies. The panel programme, which will
feature distinguished academics and experts from Turkey and Spain,
**[will consist of two sessions entitled NATO Enlargement Policy on the
Axis of Cooperation and Dialogue and Common Challenges for Turkey and
NATO.]{.underline}**

The panel will be held in English with simultaneous English-Spanish
translation and is **[expected to [address]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
following agenda items: NATO 2030: Cohesion Report for a New Era; NATO's
New Mission and Enlargement Policy; NATO's Role and Activities in Global
Security; NATO's Central Role in Euro-Atlantic Security; **[[Turkey's
Role]{.mark} in NATO; and Turkey's Approach to NATO's Enlargement
Policy.]{.underline}**

**[As a product of the [Alliance's efforts to renew]{.mark} and update
itself in line with [current priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
on 25 November 2020, a 67-page report with 138 recommendations under the
title "NATO 2030: United for a New Era" was published by the NATO Expert
Group**[. The report is also a sign of the Alliance's willingness to
strengthen its strategic and political orientation]{.underline}**.
Vision 2030 clearly shows NATO's preparations to become a security
organisation that contributes not only to member states but also to
global security.

**[[NATO]{.mark} has [played an important role in ensuring Turkey's
security]{.mark} and has contributed significantly to its goal of
[cooperating with Euro-Atlantic structures]{.mark} in a number of
respects]{.underline}**. Since its accession to the Alliance in 1952,
**[Turkey, with its extensive military capabilities, historical
background and cultural relations, has fulfilled its responsibilities to
realise the Alliance's objectives of global peace]{.underline}**,
tranquillity and security. With NATO's second-largest military, Turkey
is one of the top five contributors to Alliance missions and operations,
one of four countries that can provide airborne early warning and
refuelling aircraft to the Alliance, and one of eight that contribute
the most to NATO's joint budgets.

**[[The]{.mark} conditions generated by the war in Ukraine have put NATO
[membership applications]{.mark} from some countries on the
agenda]{.underline}**. In the face of this development, in principle our
country reiterates its "supportive" policy towards NATO enlargement; at
the same time it expresses its concern about Turkey's security
sensitivities. **[In this regard, [it is legitimate to expect
countries]{.mark} wishing to join NATO, which is constituted as a
collective security organisation, [to show sensitivity]{.mark} to the
security concerns of individual NATO members. [It is a prerequisite for
a]{.mark} candidate [country to coordinate with existing
members]{.mark}, especially on an issue such as terrorism and
counter-terrorism]{.underline}**, which has seriously threatened the
international system and the national security of states in recent
years.

#### Russia has reinforced cohesion, including Turkey

Barış **Seçkin 22**, experienced Foreign Correspondent with a
demonstrated history of working in the media production industry,
4/3/22, "Cohesion of NATO reinforced by Russian president: Defense
College commandant," *Anadolu Agency,*
<https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-crisis/cohesion-of-nato-reinforced-by-russian-president-defense-college-commandant/2524426>,
JH

**[The [commandant of NATO]{.mark} Defense College [said the cohesion of
the alliance]{.mark} has [been even reinforced by]{.mark} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}\'s recent actions]{.underline}**, now
that the region sees the Russian threat.

Lt. Gen. Olivier Rittimann told Anadolu Agency in an interview that
Ukraine was a partner of NATO and so there is a difference between a
partner and an ally.

\"**[Cohesion of NATO has been even reinforced by what President
Vladimir Putin has been trying to achieve in Russia]{.underline}**.
Because now he proved that Russia is actually a threat for Europe and
the whole area and it has really reinforced the cohesion and the
solidarity between allies,\" Rittimann said.

Commandant of the NATO Defence College, Lieutenant General Olivier
Rittimann

Commenting on the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, he said
Ukraine was a partner of NATO and the college has been working quite a
lot with Ukraine for the last 20 years.

\"In fact, if the recent events had not happened, we would have gone to
Ukraine to work together in two weeks. Of course, we had to postpone
this under the current conditions. I hope we just postponed it,\" he
added.

He also stressed the Russian aggression that started in 2008 in Georgia
and which continued in 2014 in Crimea and Donbas.

\"**[So what it proves is that \... [if you are a NATO ally you are
still safe]{.mark} because [we are (in)]{.mark} a
[solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** with 30 allies working together and
defending us together,\" he said.

Rittimann said the common response by every NATO member, every ally was
to reject \"this Russian invasion of Ukraine.\"

**[\"I think that [enlargement is something that needs to be decided
first by NATO]{.mark} if they are accepting somebody to become a member
and then by the nation which is interested]{.underline}** in becoming
a NATO member it is definitely not Russia nor China nor any others who
has to decide whether Ukraine can become a NATO member or not.

\"It is something that has to be discussed between the thirty members
of NATO and the applicant. It\'s not to be interfered by anyone else,\"
he added.

\'Turkey is one of biggest contributors to NATO alliance\'

\"Turkey is one of the biggest contributors to the alliance, it is the
second largest arm forces in NATO, Turkey is located in a region which
is at the high interest of NATO, especially these days, in what we see
in Ukraine, the Black Sea, is very important and so is the Middle East.
So, **[[Turkey is a very important ally to NATO]{.mark},\" he
said.]{.underline}**

Rittimann said Turkiye contributed to the college since the beginning,
adding that over 800 Turkish course members were educated there and that
college was twice commanded by Turkish generals.

Agenda of NATO Defense College

Pointing out that the college\'s agenda changed in 2014 as a result of
Russia\'s annexation of Crimea and its policies towards eastern Ukraine,
Rittimann said they have been working on crisis response operations for
the last 20-25 years, but after Russia\'s increasing importance on the
international scene after 2014, these studies turned to defense and
deterrence.

\"We have seen the importance of this with Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine
recently. That\'s the hottest and most important topic here in
college,\" he said.

#### Turkish reservations [will be resolved]{.underline}\-\--it's a [political maneuver]{.underline} by Erdogan.

Turkey block Finland and Sweden from becoming NATO members?" Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/24/will-turkey-block-nato-expansion/micahw

Ultimately, **[all 30 members must vote]{.underline}**
**[unanimously]{.underline}** **[in favour of the]{.underline}**
historically neutral **[Nordic nations]{.underline}** if they are **[to
join the Washington-led group]{.underline}**, so **[Turkey
could]{.underline}** -- in theory -- **[block an
application]{.underline}**.

"**[Turkey has every right]{.underline}** **[to block Sweden and
Finland's ascension to NATO]{.underline}**," Ahmet Erdi Ozturk,
associate professor in politics and international relations at London
Metropolitan University, told Al Jazeera.

**[However]{.underline}**, **[such a position would be
costly]{.underline}** **[as NATO members would]{.underline}** likely
**[approach Turkey as a]{.underline}** **[problem child]{.underline}**
**[moving forward]{.underline}**.

"**[It is hard to see Turkey's future position since it
is]{.underline}** mostly **[based on domestic political
developments]{.underline}**. We should remember that
**[Erdogan]{.underline}** **[has been doing these policy changes
to]{.underline}** **[win the next election]{.underline}**," said Ozturk.

Murat Ersavci, a former Turkish ambassador to Ireland, Oman, Australia
and Belgium, told Al Jazeera that **[Ankara]{.underline}** **[does not
oppose]{.underline}** **[membership for Sweden and Finland per
se]{.underline}**, **[but has]{.underline}**
**[reservations]{.underline}**.

**[Erdogan has accused Sweden and Finland of having an]{.underline}**
"**[open attitude towards terrorist organisations]{.underline}**", **[in
reference to the Kurdistan Workers' Party]{.underline}**
(**[PKK]{.underline}**), which Ankara considers a terrorist
organisation.

**[Turkey also says the two Nordic countries have failed to extradite
suspects it wants]{.underline}**.

**[And]{.underline}** Ankara **[remains angry over Sweden's 2019
decision to freeze arms sales]{.underline}**.

'Nothing to do with appeasing Russia'

One of Russia's stated reasons for invading Ukraine was to stop NATO
expansion, and Moscow has threatened Finland and Sweden with a vaguely
worded "response" since they made their NATO ambitions clear.

"**[Turkish reservations have]{.underline}** **[nothing]{.underline}**
**[to do with any sort of appeasement towards Russia]{.underline}**,"
said Ersavci.

**[Turkey has]{.underline}** historically **[advocated
for]{.underline}** **[NATO enlargement]{.underline}**, he added.

"Turkey has always been strongly in favour of NATO enlargement, **[as
seen with the]{.underline}** **[Baltic states]{.underline}**,
**[Poland]{.underline}**, **[Hungary]{.underline}**,
**[Romania]{.underline}**, **[Bulgaria]{.underline}**, **[as well
as]{.underline}** **[Slovenia]{.underline}**,
**[Slovakia]{.underline}**, **[Montenegro]{.underline}**,
**[Macedonia]{.underline}**, **[Croatia]{.underline}**,
**[Albania]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** even
**[Georgia]{.underline}**. **[However]{.underline}**, **[the situation
is now different]{.underline}**," he said.

"**[There is a very strong]{.underline}** **[public perception in Turkey
that Sweden is assisting Turkey's enemies]{.underline}**, and **[this
exerts]{.underline}** **[huge pressure on the
government]{.underline}**," said Ersavci.

However, he said **[Ankara perhaps should have engaged in
a]{.underline}** **[private diplomatic process]{.underline}** to address
its reservations before going public and sparking a global controversy.

The alliance now finds itself in a difficult position.

On one hand, **[Sweden]{.underline}**, **[Finland]{.underline}** **[and
the vast majority of member states are keen to]{.underline}**
**[fast-track]{.underline}** **[the applications]{.underline}**. On the
other, **[Turkey]{.underline}** **[appears intent on stalling the
process over national interests]{.underline}**, at least
**[temporarily]{.underline}**.

"**[Turkey remains]{.underline}** a fairly **[influential]{.underline}**
member within NATO," Garret J Martin, lecturer and co-director of the
Transatlantic Policy Center at American University, told Al Jazeera.

"**[Its geopolitical position makes it a very valuable player while the
second largest]{.underline}** **[standing military force in
NATO]{.underline}**, behind the United States, **[makes it a potential
contributor to the collective defence of the alliance]{.underline}**."

What next?

**[Washington]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[NATO
officials]{.underline}** **[have said they expect Turkey's issues to be
resolved]{.underline}**, **[even as Ankara's]{.underline}**
**[rhetoric]{.underline}** **[remains tough]{.underline}**.

Despite recent developments, **[experts]{.underline}** **[believe
negotiations might proceed]{.underline}** **[more quietly]{.underline}**
**[moving forward]{.underline}**.

"**[The next step is likely to be a flurry]{.underline}** **[of
behind-the-scenes diplomacy]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[international pressure]{.underline}**, **[to convince Turkey to
quickly remove the roadblock]{.underline}**. Sweden and Finland will
seek to placate Turkey, but **[we can]{.underline}** also **[expect
the]{.underline}** **[US]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the
**[EU]{.underline}** **[to play a]{.underline}** **[leading
role]{.underline}** **[in this pressure campaign]{.underline}**," Martin
said.

"After all, **[both]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** some
**[leverage over Turkey]{.underline}**, be it **[through]{.underline}**
\[**[Washington's]{.underline}**\] **[sale of military equipment or
the]{.underline}** \[**[EU's]{.underline}**\] **[provision of aid as
part of the 2016 migration deal]{.underline}**."

Meanwhile, a sense of urgency is growing amid the Ukraine war and as the
alliance prepares for its Madrid summit in late June, where a united
front is essential.

"**[The]{.underline}** **[most likely outcome]{.underline}** **[remains
Finland and Sweden joining the alliance very soon]{.underline}**.
**[Erdogan is a transactional leader]{.underline}**, and **[the costs of
blocking the two Nordic countries]{.underline}** -- **[deeply angering
Western allies]{.underline}** -- **[would]{.underline}** **[far
outweigh]{.underline}** **[the benefits in terms of domestic
support]{.underline}**," said Martin.

Meanwhile, several observers have said **[Turkey is using this
particular moment for leverage]{.underline}**.

"Erdogan also briefly blocked in 2009 the nomination of Anders Fogh
Rasmussen as NATO's secretary-general, before relenting after receiving
a prize in a high-level appointment for a Turkish official in the
alliance," said Martin.

With this in mind, **[NATO]{.underline}** **[might again be willing to
make]{.underline}** reasonable **[concessions]{.underline}** **[to
Turkey to overcome this temporary encumbrance]{.underline}** **[and
proceed with the application process]{.underline}**.

"Since the rest of the alliance is welcoming Finland and Sweden with
open arms, **[there is clear political will to overcome this temporary
roadblock]{.underline}**," Martin said.

#### Turkey just wants [concessions]{.underline}\-\--they're not [completely]{.underline} opposed to accession.

RAMSTEIN, Germany -- **[[Since]{.mark} the beginning of [Russia's
attack]{.mark} on Ukraine [NATO has]{.mark} taken measures to [shield
its member States along]{.mark} the [eastern flank]{.mark} from
potential aggression]{.underline}**. In the air, Allied Air Command
commands and employs military aircraft from the nations and NATO to
execute enhanced Vigilance Activities.

**[NATO has [substantially increased]{.mark} the number of [fighter
jets]{.mark} on alert [across Eastern Europe]{.mark} in response to
Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine]{.underline}**. NATO's enhanced
vigilance is a powerful statement of Alliance resolve and cohesion
\[that demonstrates\] our commitment to protect every inch of NATO
territory of all our Allies

"**[NATO [air forces have bolstered]{.mark} their [presence]{.mark} in
the eastern part of the Alliance [helping to shield NATO against any
aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Several dozen fighter jets are on
alert at any time to response to possible airspace violations and to
deter aggression," said Headquarters Allied Air Command Chief of Staff,
Major General Jörg Lebert. "Allied Air Command integrates the Allied air
forces' fighters, air-to-air refuelling and transport aircraft as well
as Allied and NATO airborne warning and control (AWACS) platforms into
the standing arrangements to safeguard the skies above the Allies.
**[These assets enable NATO to patrol the Allied airspace and have 24/7
situational awareness above NATO and adjacent territory," he
added.]{.underline}**

Allied fighters take off from their home bases, forward deployment bases
or carriers flying Air Patrol missions along the Alliance's eastern
flank.

**[A Joint Force Air Component (JFAC) was stood up at Allied Air Command
to plan, task and control Allied aircraft flying enhanced Vigilance
Activities]{.underline}**. Both Combined Air Operations Centres in
Uedem, Germany, and Torrejón, Spain, and the Deployable Command and
Control Centre at Poggio Renatico, Italy, have sent personnel to augment
the JFAC for the mission.

**["NATO's [enhanced vigilance is a powerful statement of]{.mark}
Alliance [resolve and cohesion]{.mark} under the umbrella of Deterrence
and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area concept," said Major General
Lebert.]{.underline}** "These activities are prudent and defensive
measures that **[[increase]{.mark} our [readiness]{.mark}, underpin

[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, US President **[Joe [Biden told]{.mark}
his [French counterpart]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Saturday, adding that
he felt strongly about ensuring NATO\'s \"cohesion.\"

\"As we say back in the States, **[we\'re on the same

on the margins of the ongoing G7 summit in the UK.

**[The US president also explained that he stood fully in support of

**[\"I think it\'s great to have a US president part of the club and

#### France is fully committed to NATO

**France Diplomacy 22**, French news site 3/15/22, "France and NATO,"
*France Diplomacy,*
https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/our-alliances-and-cooperations/france-and-nato/

**[France: a [reliable]{.mark}, [responsible]{.mark} and
[supportive]{.mark} ally]{.underline}**

**[[France is]{.mark} one of the 12 [founding member]{.mark}s of
NATO]{.underline}**. It also hosted the first permanent headquarters in
Paris in the 1950s and 60s. In 1966, France decided to withdraw from the
Alliance's integrated military command. That decision in no way
undermined France's commitment to the Alliance's collective defence. As
General de Gaulle put it, the aim was to change the form of our Alliance
without changing its substance. Following the positive vote of the
National Assembly, **[France officially announced its full participation
in NATO military command structures]{.underline}** at the Strasbourg /
Kehl Summit in April 2009. French personnel returned to the Alliance's
command structures from 2009, split between Allied Command Operations
(ACO) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT). Currently, when all
structures and agencies are taken into account, France has almost 780
troops seconded to NATO entities. **[Since 2015, [ACT]{.mark} has been
[commanded]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a [French Air Force]{.mark} General, with
the mission of leading the warfare development of military
structures]{.underline}**, forces, capabilities and doctrines of the
Alliance to enable NATO to meet its level of ambition and fulfil its
three essential core tasks.

**[Since the 1990s, after the end of the Cold War, [France has
contributed significantly to NATO operations]{.mark}. France thus took
part [in]{.mark} NATO [crisis management operations]{.mark} upon their
creation in 1993]{.underline}**, **[in Bosnia]{.underline}** under IFOR
from 1993 to 2004 and the NATO air campaign **[in Kosovo]{.underline}**
in 1999. France then contributed actively to the NATO force in Kosovo,
holding KFOR command on three occasions.

**[France, engaged in Afghanistan from 2001, contributed
significantly to the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF]{.underline}**), placed under NATO command in 2003. It also
contributed to Operation Unified Protector in Libya in 2011, under UN
Security Council Resolution 1973. Since 2018, France has deployed some
380 staff to support the Sea Guardian maritime operation to fight
terrorist activities in the Mediterranean. It has also participated in
the NATO training mission in Iraq since 2018.

**[Since 2016, [France has contributed to reassurance measures for
Baltic States and Poland]{.mark}, launched [in response to Russia's
illegal invasion of Crimea]{.mark} in 2014]{.underline}**. Every year,
**[France provides an armoured, mechanized combined arms company
team]{.underline}** of 300 personnel including Leclerc tanks and
infantry combat vehicles, integrated over eight months over alternate
years in a multinational battalion in Estonia (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022)
and Lithuania (2018, 2020). **[It also provides air policing support to
Estonia and participates in the AWACS patrols]{.underline}** over
Eastern Europe. This strong, consistent commitment is unanimously
appreciated and has led to exceptional partnerships with host countries.

France also contributes to NATO's tailored Forward Presence in the Black
Sea with its ship deployments in the Black Sea (two or three per year)
and maritime surveillance missions with maritime patrol aircraft.

France is holding the rotating command of NATO's Very High Readiness
Joint Task Force (VJTF) in the first half of 2022.

**[[In light of Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine]{.mark} in
2022, [France]{.mark} decided to [further increase its contribution to
reassurance for the Allies most exposed to Russia]{.mark}'s threatening
actions]{.underline}**. A 500-strong French contingent has therefore
been deployed in Romania. Almost 200 troops have also joined the
enhanced Forward Presence group in Estonia and 4 Mirage 2000-5 fighter
aircraft have been deployed for air policing missions in Poland.

**[France is one of the few Allies to have a defence instrument that is
combat-tested and covers the entire spectrum]{.underline}**. National
capability priorities will ensure that this defence tool is maintained
and updated consistent with the objectives approved within NATO and the
European Union.

**[At the diplomatic and political levels, [France]{.mark} also [has a
key role in fostering]{.mark} a balanced and mutually [beneficial
transatlantic relationship]{.mark} where Europeans play their full part
in security and defence]{.underline}**. The European initiatives
developed in this field in 2017 (Permanent Structured Cooperation, EU
European Defence Fund, European Intervention Initiative and European
Peace Facility) **[fully complement NATO's action and therefore help
Europeans to invest more in their defence and be more effective and
competent from a military perspective.]{.underline}**

### AT: NATO Expansion/Nordic Thumper

#### Nordic bids don't hold up cohesion

Richard **Milne 22**, Richard Milne was a capital markets editor,
European business correspondent, correspondent in both Frankfurt and
Paris as well as a graduate trainee, 6/13/22, "Nato chief says he had
'no reason to believe' Turkey would block Nordic membership," *Financial
Times,* https://www.ft.com/content/80039389-1d2b-4eca-9cf6-476a2a6ca0ac\
**[Nato's [secretary-general insisted]{.mark} he had "[no reason to
believe]{.mark}" [Turkey]{.mark} would [block Finland and Sweden's bids
to join]{.mark}]{.underline}** the military alliance when he promised
the Nordic countries a quick accession process in April.

Jens Stoltenberg told the Financial Times **[that [it was still possible
to overcome]{.mark} Ankara's "[legitimate" concerns over
terrorism]{.mark} and arms sales]{.underline}** "within a reasonable
time". The former Norwegian prime minister added: "Earlier in the
process, we had no reasons to believe there would be any problems.

The Turkish concerns are not new. **[[Türkiye is an important ally,
and]{.mark} when an ally raises [security concerns]{.mark}, [we have to
address]{.mark} them]{.underline}**." Nato officials promised Finland
and Sweden that the first stage of their Nato bid would only take one or
two weeks, before Turkey raised objections over terrorism and support
for the Kurds just as the two Nordic nations applied last month after
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly hit out at Sweden
and Finland, calling them "guesthouses" for terrorists and demanding
that their Nato applications be blocked. **[[Finnish and Swedish
ministers]{.mark} have [spoken about toughening]{.mark} their
anti-[terrorism laws]{.mark} and potentially easing the criteria for
Turkish arms sales]{.underline}** once they are Nato members.

But officials from both countries have also complained that it is hard
to pin the Turks down in terms of their actual
demands**[.]{.underline}** Asked if his own credibility was on the line
after he told Finland and Sweden their ratification would be quick,
**[Stoltenberg repeated that he had "no reason to believe at that time"
there would be any problems]{.underline}**. **[Finnish
president]{.underline}** Sauli Niinistö has also said that **[in
an]{.underline}** April **[conversation with [Erdoğan]{.mark} the
Turkish president [assured]{.mark} him any [Nato bid would be viewed
favourably.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Stoltenberg said on Monday: "My goal is to have Finland and Sweden as
members as soon as possible. It can still be quick compared with other
accession processes]{.underline}**." He said there was no deadline to
resolve the issue by Nato's summit in Madrid at the end of June, which
many had seen as a moment for the defence alliance to formally welcome
its new applicants. Turkey's concerns seem less directed at Finland than
Sweden, which has a significant Kurdish population and whose government
has twice survived only thanks to a deal with a Swedish-Kurdish MP that
includes support for a group that Erdoğan calls terrorists.

"**[The [Turkish concerns on terrorism are legitimate]{.mark}. Because
no Nato ally has suffered more terrorist attacks than Türkiye . . . We
will sit down with Türkiye and find a common way
forward]{.underline}**," Stoltenberg said, using the name for the
country favoured by Erdoğan. He also praised Magdalena Andersson,
Sweden's prime minister whom he will visit later on Monday, for "Swedish
readiness to address Türkiye's concerns" by amending anti-terror laws
and suggesting arms sales to Ankara could be made easier. Niinistö
appeared to indicate on Sunday that Finland would not abandon Sweden
should its neighbour run into difficulties with its Nato bid, stressing
that "Sweden's cause is ours".

the alliance,]{.underline}** Austin said.  

\"During this enormous crisis in European security, **[we\'re proud to

\"**[Together]{.underline}**, **[we have risen to the challenge of

**[are making long-term plans to deter]{.underline}** **[and defend

The secretary said he was pleased with the work the ministers did during
the ministerial but could not elaborate on the decisions. Those will be
ratified later. \"See you in Madrid,\" he told reporters. 

#### Strategic concept will focus on deterrence -- the direct nature of the Ukraine war means NATO will refocus on conventional deterrence instead of hybrid and non-state threats.

**[Initial discussions on the next Strategic Concept revolved around the
need to prepare the Alliance for a world characterised by the return of
inter-state threats and great power competition]{.underline}**. **[This
alone marked a sharp contrast with the Alliance's post-Cold War focus on
transnational challenges and non-peer competitors. What would the return
of great power competition entail for the evolving balance between
NATO's so-called three core tasks]{.underline}** (i.e. collective
defense, crisis management and cooperative security)? How should NATO
balance a renewed focus on inter-state threats and great power
competitors with the ongoing relevance of transnational threats and
challenges, like terrorism or the climate-security nexus? When thinking
about great power competition, how much emphasis should NATO put on
Russia's immediate threat to Europe, as opposed to the more systemic
challenge represented by China's strategic rise? And what should be the
right balance between the military and non-military aspects of great
power competition? The latter question becomes particularly relevant in
light of the growing salience of "hybrid" forms of warfare and emerging
disruptive technologies, which compel the Alliance to emphasise societal
resilience at home and step up its efforts to innovate technologically.
**[The war in Ukraine -- and ongoing debates about how the Alliance can
assist Ukraine while strengthening deterrence in Eastern Europe -- have
become important topics in Strategic Concept discussions]{.underline}**.
In a way, **[the current war vindicates the view that we do indeed live
in an increasingly competitive world, and that inter-state threats are
back]{.underline}**. On the other hand, **[the overt and direct nature
of Russia's invasion challenges some of the pervading assumptions about
how future conflict was likely to unfold in indirect and hybrid
ways.]{.underline}**

#### NATO members want to focus on deterring further Russian aggression now.

For decades **[the Baltic States and Poland have been]{.underline}** the
most **[vocal advocates of the threat posed by Russia's aggressive
foreign policy to the peace and stability of Eastern Europe and beyond.
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine there is a feeling that
testing NATO's resolve in the Baltic states and Poland may well be the
next move]{.underline}**. Thus, **[they are convinced that a greater
NATO presence and enablers capable of deterring and, if necessary,
defending the area are urgently needed]{.underline}**. History taught
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia the lessons of living in a tough
neighbourhood with Russia. After gaining independence in the 1990s they
focused their foreign and security policies on two main goals: joining
both the EU and NATO. First, these two goals determined their
geopolitical will to become an official part of the vital Western
alliances, showing a willingness to follow the Western way of life and
its values. Secondly, they had practical implications as they helped
build a framework for economic development and offered official security
guarantees from the West. To become members of NATO, the Baltic states
not only reformed and strengthened their armed forces (with material and
expert support from the Nordic countries) but also contributed to NATO
missions in many of the period's hotspots, such as Bosnia and
Hercegovina and Iraq. **[The greater or lesser but constant physical
menace from Russia felt by the Baltic States has led them to mainly
focus on conventional threats as they are both real and
existential]{.underline}**. Yet the shifts in modern warfare witnessed
in Ukraine starting from 2014 also require focusing on hybrid threats,
as they can be used during peacetime or as a preparation prior to
aggression. **[Given Russia's regional military advantage, aggressive
rhetoric against the Baltic States and possibly permanent Russian troop
deployments in Belarus, it is essential for NATO to enhance its
defensive capabilities in the region, moving away from an enhanced
forward presence towards forward defence. This is the crucial reason why
the Baltic States are focused on more practical military
solutions]{.underline}** (to be described in this article) **[during the
upcoming NATO Strategic Concept and NATO Summit in
Madrid]{.underline}**.

**[At the upcoming]{.underline}** G7 and **[NATO summits, Russia will be
No 1 on the agenda]{.underline}**, while **[China will also be a
focus,]{.underline}** experts said. **[Because of the ongoing
Russia-Ukraine conflict, \"the focus fundamentally will remain on Russia
at these summits]{.underline}**\", Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, told China Daily.
He said the issue of China would also be brought into the spotlight, for
the two groups \"had already been thinking a little bit about China for
a few years\". \"That\'s why **[this issue of China being big into the
NATO Strategic Concept was something which was cooking for a couple of
years]{.underline}**,\" Gupta said. The G7 group will hold its 48th
summit at Schloss Elmau in Germany between Saturday and Monday. The NATO
summit will take place in the Spanish capital Madrid on the last two
days of June. **[NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the summit
would update the NATO Strategic Concept, and will include China in this
document for the first time.]{.underline}** On Tuesday, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies hosted a news briefing call
previewing the two summits. During the call, Matthew Goodman, senior
vice-president for economics at the CSIS, said **[the two summits are
\"a pretty challenging set of meetings\" for the United
States]{.underline}**. \"The good news is that President (Joe) **[Biden
has some wind at his back because he was able to mobilize this group of
allies and partners to take on the Russia-Ukraine challenge initially.
But the question is: Can he move the ball forward]{.underline}** on
these two --- at these two meetings,\" Goodman said. \"There are some
pretty significant headwinds here. you have Ukraine bogged down. You\'ve

WASHINGTON (AP) --- President Joe **[Biden is out to sustain the global
alliance punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine as he embarks on a
five-day trip to Europe]{.underline}** as the four-month-old war shows
no sign of abating and its aftershocks to global food and energy
supplies are deepening. Biden first joins a meeting of the Group of
Seven leading economic powers in the Bavarian Alps of Germany and later
travels to Madrid for a summit with leaders of the 30 NATO countries.
**[The visit comes as the global coalition to bolster Ukraine and punish

conflict. Biden, who left Washington on Saturday, and the G-7 leaders
intend to announce a ban on importing gold from Russia, according to a
person familiar with White House planning who was not authorized to
discuss the matter publicly. Gold is Moscow's second largest export
after energy. The Ukraine war has entered a more attritional phase since
Biden's last trip to Europe in March, just weeks after Russia launched
its assault. At that time, he met with allies in Brussels as Ukraine was
under regular bombardment and he tried to reassure Eastern Europe
partners in Poland that they would not be the next to face an incursion
by Moscow. Russian's subsequent retreat from western Ukraine and
regrouping in the east has shifted the conflict to one of artillery
battles and bloody house-to-house fighting in the country's industrial
heartland, the Donbas region. **[While U.S. officials see broad

**[In its last strategic concept, NATO focused more on problems like
terrorism rather than on conventional warfare, reforming its military
structure and procuring lighter military equipment. After the Russian
aggression in Ukraine there is much speculation in the media about the
lack of specific military equipment in NATO countries. Their lack could
also be detrimental to strengthening NATO's eastern flank on a more
long-term basis. To strengthen the security of the Baltic States more
heavy equipment, such as tanks and heavy artillery, must be deployed in
the regio]{.underline}**n. **[This could be a helpful deterrence measure
against Russia and increase the capabilities of NATO forces in the
area]{.underline}** as all three Baltic States have either mechanised or
motorised brigades. All of these combat-ready military capabilities must
be formed in NATO countries at a national level and only then can they
be sent to the Baltics. It is to be hoped that the current trend in
rising military spending will soon cover all the most urgent gaps. Air
defence is a crucial gap for the security of the Baltic States. They
lack fighter jets and long-range air-defence systems, so they are
heavily dependent on NATO air policing missions (despite efforts to
strengthen their mid-range air defence capabilities). While the air
policing concept might have been efficient when it was created, it
should now focus more on integrated air defence. First, **[NATO fighter
jets in the Baltics should be consistently armed and ready to engage if
needed.]{.underline}** Secondly, **[NATO should think about deploying
extra surface-based air defence]{.underline}** (especially long-range)
capabilities that can be integrated with local air defence
infrastructures and capabilities and strengthen air defence capabilities
by expanding eFP forces to the brigade level. Furthermore, NATO's
presence in the air could be reinforced by having high-readiness
airpower capabilities assigned to be deployed in the Baltic States in a
crisis or conflict.

**[There are no positives in this war, but we note that Europe and

and resolute. Furthermore, we see historic commitments by leaders to
finally match the 2% defence spending target.]{.underline}**

**[We need to take note of the digital aspects of this
war]{.underline}**. Before the first troops entered Ukraine, Russia had
been subjecting Ukraine to years of cyber warfare. This has disrupted
critical infrastructure and weakened the state, in preparation for
military invasion.

Artificial intelligence and drones are already revolutionising warfare,
and new technologies like quantum computing are set to change the way we
look at cybersecurity. **[It is vital that the EU and its [NATO allies
stay at the forefront of tech]{.mark}nological [advances]{.mark} and
strengthen their cooperation with the private sector for an effective
crisis response.]{.underline}**

**[We must build efficient governance structures between the EU and its
member states, [NATO and the private sector,]{.mark} so that we are
ready [to work together and respond in times of
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is especially the case in critical
sector areas, such as banking, energy or healthcare. A good example for
inspiration is the European Central Bank\'s Euro Cyber Resilience Board.

**[Impressive [tech innovations]{.mark} are [no longer coming from
governments]{.mark}, but from technology companies, and often smaller
players]{.underline}**. It is therefore vital for our resilience to
build an innovative tech ecosystem in the EU and in NATO allied
countries.

**[[This requires investment. NATO showed impressive leadership
in]{.mark} its collaboration with the private sector last year, setting
up the Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies and
implementing the NATO Investment Fund and the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic

In addition, 20% of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility was
dedicated to digital spending for the first time ever. In the US,
digital infrastructure has been central to the Biden\'s Build Back
Better plan.

In the context of a devastating pandemic followed by a devastating war,
we call on NATO leaders to increase their spending target to 3% of GDP,
with 1% dedicated to funding for emerging and disruptive technologies.

another]{.underline}**. NATO has recently announced several initiatives
to build on past success, but more are needed---particularly as members
increase their military funding. 

Virtually all alliance members are investing more in defense or are soon
planning to do so. Germany, for example, declared that it would create a
100-billion-Euro fund and reach its 2% goal in 2022. Poland, which
shares the longest EU border with Ukraine, has taken in more than 3.5
million Ukrainian refugees and promised to dedicate 3% of its GDP to
defense. Croatia ramped up its defense investment to 2.3% of GDP. 

**[[To ensure that this new investment spurs innovation]{.mark} and

**[In the context of the rapid pace of progress in several
[tech]{.mark}nologies [driven by the private sector and market
forces]{.mark}, [NATO's]{.mark} approach to [innovation]{.mark} and EDTs
[stands out]{.mark} in comparison to previous adaptation efforts in the
1990s and 2000s]{.underline}**. The ongoing reflection in the Emerging
and Disruptive Technologies Roadmap and the NATO 2030 process is perhaps
one of the most systematic efforts to develop a strategic and
coordinated approach to several technology priority areas, backed
simultaneously by institutional change and procedural innovation.
**[[Today's iteration of]{.mark} defense [innovation seems an order of
magnitude and speed above what the alliance has experienced
before]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It builds on substantial changes in NATO
processes, structures, authorities, and skills to reward risk taking and
experimentation. **[[NATO's innovation efforts]{.mark} also [go beyond
the traditional focus]{.mark} on technical and operational
standardization, and they include a prominent ethical and normative
dimension.]{.underline}** As the NATO secretary-general recently
underlined, allies "should also look into how NATO can be the platform
to address ethical aspects of these technologies," including by
developing "guideline standards."22

NATO has a real opportunity to broaden its vision and practice in this
area by using innovation in EDTs as a linchpin for a new allied
framework in which innovation drives the adaptation process. If the
flexibility, creativity, and diversity of democratic societies,
governments, advanced economies, and research communities are a
strategic asset, as the NATO 2030 process suggests, then NATO can create
an innovation environment that competes with more centralized
alternatives, such China's process of civil-military fusion. For
example, **[the new NATO [accelerator]{.mark} [could prioritize
disruptive innovation]{.mark} in strategic digital systems of systems
and technology convergence]{.underline}** (notably, combinations of
emerging technologies) **[[while maintaining]{.mark} the trend of
sustained [innovation]{.mark} in other emerging technologies such as
hypersonics]{.underline}**. The aim would be to start on a disruptive
pathway, with a view to challenging the operational models of
adversaries, rather than merely improving allied military capabilities.
**[Thus, the accelerator could become NATO's permanent offset
capacity.]{.underline}**

Specifically, building on ongoing efforts, NATO should consider
addressing the following five areas as key to its
innovation-as-adaptation framework.

**[[Establishing a NATO Civil-Military Tech]{.mark}nology Assessment
[Capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**

During the Cold War, the allies had dedicated instruments---for example,
the Cooperation Committee---to monitor and control technological
diffusion. **[[Now, to facilitate innovation]{.mark} and improve its
adaptability through innovation[, NATO needs a strategic-level,
civil-military capacity]{.mark} for horizon scanning, technology
assessment, and monitoring]{.underline}**. Such a capability would build
on work currently undertaken by NATO ACT and the Science and Technology
Organization, and it would be complementary to the Innovation Board and
Defense Innovation Accelerator. However, **[[it would broaden the scope
to include a variety of military and civilian, state, and private-sector
actors active in the EDTs innovation]{.mark} ecosystem. It would deliver
constant understanding (including taxonomies) and intelligence on
technological developments in academia, the private sector, and the
military across the alliance, as well as the authority to link such
developments to NATO innovation priorities]{.underline}**. It would
contribute to the resilience of allies by monitoring the transfer of
jointly agreed critical EDTs (software and hardware) to non-NATO and
non-partner countries. And it would provide intelligence and
understanding among the allies on adversarial developments in defense
innovation and EDTs uptake. Established as a distinct entity or within
an existing NATO structure, this capability should regularly consult
with competent EU bodies to exchange information, improve understanding,
and facilitate coordination on output and commonality of purpose.

//um-ef)

Conclusion -- overcoming maladaptation This article has offered an
analysis of the risks of maladaptation that NATO has been exposed to
while seeking congruence with its environment. As any security
organisation, NATO has since the end of the Cold War sought to align
with the needs and policies of its member states; yet such **[adaptation
has generated side effects that can undermine the Alliance's own
relevance.]{.underline}** We have looked at the context of the new Cold
War to explore this maladaptation. As of 2014, the resurgence of Russia
as a peer competitor has given NATO a new role as a collective defence
organisation; **[Russia constitutes a threat and NATO offers a response
to it; through the shift to collective defence NATO seemed to align with
its environment]{.underline}**. What we have seen in this article though
is that the pure defence-focused response is insufficient to NATO's
alignment with its threat environment. Because the threats are diverse
and embrace a large range of possible actions, the policy response needs
to be equally broad-ranging and multi-domain. This leads to the dilemma
by which **[NATO must play with two imperfect policy options: either it
focuses on the narrow segment of defence]{.underline}** but then risks
being ill-equipped for the multifaceted threats; **[or it enlarges its
mandate to a broad range of tasks but then it runs the risks of diluting
its core military function]{.underline}**. The dilemma is here to stay.
Member states are unlikely to agree on a strategy that would clearly
identify one path at the expense of the other. And security institutions
inherently struggle to demonstrate relevance and adjust their own
mandate to the evolving environment. In this context, the challenge
comes from the exposed dilemma as much as it is about **[a trade-off
between the narrow and the broad paths]{.underline}**; in lieu of a
binary choice the way forward is probably to calibrate the scope of the
broadening (see Shea 2019). Here is the relevance challenge: for NATO to
keep the military edge and being able to prevail in future military
operations, while sufficiently enlarging the scope of its mandate so
that it can respond to the most acute contemporary threats. Such
trade-off builds a slightly different notion of congruence that is in
the end more equivocal than initially asserted. Further research is
needed on this calibrating exercise as a potential response to
maladaptation. When doing this, three sets of considerations will have
to be taken into account, and one possible path is recommended. First,
the NATO of the Cold War is no longer a useful point of comparison; the
threat environment is simply too different today and adaptation has, as
a consequence, become a very different process. Second, maintaining a
comparative advantage in the military domain will most likely remain a
priority and therefore the starting point of any adaptation policy.
Failing that, NATO's added value would be at stake. Third, the nature of
the threats means that NATO must to a degree embrace a wider security
agenda: hybridity calls for it, and resisting task expansion will be
difficult. In this context, one possible way out comes from
burden-sharing through institutional partnerships (Flockhart 2014). Back
in the 2000s, the idea of the Comprehensive Approach (CA) emerged from
**[the acknowledgement that "NATO cannot do it all", and must,
therefore, rely on partners]{.underline}** which, because of their own
expertise and comparative advantages, would maximise the broad
international efforts, be it in Kosovo or in Afghanistan (see Williams
2011, Tardy 2012, Jakobsen 2018). This **[is no less valid
today]{.underline}**. Partnerships carry benefits that alliances bring,
be it in terms of capability aggregation, strategy coordination, or
burden-sharing (Wallander and Keohane 2002). Partnering with others is
imperative as there are issues that are simply not for NATO to tackle
and that are nonetheless essential to NATO's mission. How to organise
this new type of comprehensive approach goes beyond the remit of this
article. **[The thinking relates to other institutions such as the
EU]{.underline}** or the UN, but also to sub-state actors such as
municipalities, law enforcement entities or regions, as well as the
private sector. **[At least two principles should guide the reflection
so as to minimise the risk of maladaptation: first is the fact that any
task expansion be based on NATO's added value as a defence
institution]{.underline}**. It is this defence added value that must
determine the nature of NATO's role in any broader partnership. **[Any
task expansion that would not make the military nature of the Alliance
the starting point of the discussion would potentially lead back to the
unintended consequences of adaptation and create
incongruence]{.underline}**. Second, any burden-sharing implies that
NATO may not be in the lead, but rather in support of other actors, and
even, theoretically, coordinated by others. This implies a sense of
modesty in some areas of multi-domain threat response, where NATO's
added value is not central. Making these points takes us far from the
alleged pertinence of the post-Ukraine collective defence agenda. Yet,
this is what NATO's relevance and congruence with the
twenty-first-century security environment are about.

Implications for NATO's Strategic Concept

In the coming years, **[[NATO needs to balance]{.mark} the impetus
toward [being a "liberal bulwark" with its traditional]{.mark} role as a
[defense alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[To do so will require a
thorough understanding of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the strategic
environment, particularly the threat posed by **[[Russia and]{.mark} the
challenges posed by [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. NATO must adapt
**[[by better delineating what]{.mark} aspects of [security planning it
is best suited to and what would be better delegated to other
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[while prioritizing partnerships
that share NATO values.]{.underline}** As the drafting of the Strategic
Concept is being finalized and moving toward formal adoption by the NATO
allies in Madrid in June, **[[it is crucial to avoid the temptation to
define "resilience" as a core task]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Strategic
Concept from 2010 outlined the core tasks of "collective defense,"
"crisis management" and "cooperative security," but **[[adding a fourth
core task]{.underline}]{.mark}** this time around **[[would further
confuse what is core to the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[NATO
needs to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[prioritize and
refocus]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[on collective
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its original and continued raison
d'être. The digital age and the significance of political warfare is
bringing about new challenges, **[[but the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
transatlantic **[[alliance is better off tying resilience to collective
defense as an integral part of it rather than risking the inflation of
core tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Narrow focus is key.

NATO's continued transformation in the coming years seems all but
certain; less certain is what it will transform into. **[The [alliance
has survived]{.mark} this long [by adapting]{.mark}. But [unlike]{.mark}
during [previous rounds of adaptation that involved]{.mark} the alliance
[taking on more responsibilities and tasks]{.mark}, the [coming
decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**---whose defining feature will be the
continued rise of China---**[will [require a much more]{.mark} [narrowly
focused alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[For nigh on three decades,
NATO had the luxury of pondering what kind of alliance it wanted to be
as it searched for a new raison d'etre in the reduced threat environment
following the end of the Cold War. But the contrast between the 1990s
and today's deluge of challenges and threats is stark, and NATO no
longer has the luxury of time. [To ensure the alliance's future
operational utility, the alliance must embrace its original collective
defense identity and look for ways to streamline]{.mark}, [and where
possible reduce, its existing collective security and crisis
management]{.mark} activities.]{.underline}** In addition to offloading
existing responsibilities to the EU and UN, **[NATO should [think twice
before taking on new mandates]{.mark} [and avoid elevating new tasks
like resiliency]{.mark}]{.underline}** or counterterrorism missions and
assigning them equal importance to Article 5. **[The alternative to the
vision outlined here is an alliance increasingly weighed down by a
myriad of tasks, unable to prioritize among them, and lacking both the
political will and financial resources to perform its main function. An
overburdened NATO risks being unable to fulfill its chief purpose of
collective defense, thereby increasing the risk of further fracturing
within the alliance.]{.underline}** The proposed course of action will
by no means be an easy one. **[But it provides the best chance to
guarantee that the transatlantic alliance will have the capabilities and
assets needed to meet the challenges posed by China's
rise]{.underline}**.

#### Concept key to reinforce deterrence \-\-- adding new issues to the NATO menu trades-off with focus

Balancing Russia and China First and foremost, the **[[US will
want]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[the Strategic
Concept]{.underline}]{.mark}**, last updated in 2010, **[[to more
accurately reflect today's threat environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This requires acknowledging that NATO is up against not one, but two
strategic challengers---Russia and China---and getting the balance right
between the two. **[[Step one is to recast
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is no longer the possible partner
envisioned in the last concept but **[[now an adversarial
force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The aim should be **[[to provide a clear
mandate]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and a unified threat assessment to
better enable the alliance to address]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[Kremlin's persistent probing and aggression in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While some allies have accused the Biden
administration of trying to "park" the Russia issue in favour of other
priorities (China), Washington has kept a focus on Moscow in respect to
arms control, cyber threats, authoritarianism, disinformation and
foreign malign influence. US Defense Secretary Austin's recent visit to
the Black Sea reinforced US commitment to countering Russia's
conventional military threat in Europe and NATO's fundamental role in
deterring and defending against it. Step two is to add China, which is
not even mentioned in the last concept. Reflecting its own geostrategic
shift to the Indo-Pacific, which elevates China as the "pacing"
challenge over a Russia in relative decline, the US has spent the last
few years pushing NATO to do more about China. Washington has met
resistance from some allies who view China primarily as a US problem
with a military threat too far from NATO's borders; or prefer to
maintain cautious cooperation with China in favour of lucrative economic
opportunities; or argue Russia remains the most pressing threat, more
squarely in NATO's wheelhouse. In the 2021 Brussels Summit Communique,
allies carefully cited both the challenges and opportunities posed by
China's rise for the first time in a NATO document. From here, the US
wants the new concept to clarify NATO's role and approach. But a robust
debate is ongoing, even in Washington, on whether NATO should focus on
countering China in the European theatre (primarily through building
resilience to cyber threats, technological penetration, and political
and economic subversion) or branch out to more conventional military
activities with key allies in the Indo-Pacific (though not necessarily
under a NATO flag). Hoping to leverage its closest allies against both
its major challengers, the US will want the alliance to help address the
"strategic simultaneity" problem. Given that the US and its allies could
face two crises at once---one in Europe's East with Russia and another
in the Indo-Pacific with China---who will go where, what will they bring
and what role will NATO itself have? Answering these questions will
require frank conversations among the US and its allies about division
of labour, expectations and assumptions that will be baked into the
Strategic Concept. Boosting Defence, Deterrence and Burden Sharing
**[Another [top priority for]{.mark} the [US in the concept will
be]{.mark} bolstering the basics]{.underline}**---i.e., **[[ensuring
NATO can fulfil its core function of]{.mark} defence and
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**---whether **[[against Russia,
China]{.mark} or any other actor]{.underline}**. **[Some in [Washington
worry NATO's]{.mark} recent [efforts]{.mark} [to take on new
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}** like climate security **[[could distract
from the alliance's baseline tasks.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The **[[US
will push to keep a focus on filling key capability gaps; improving
mobility, readiness and exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**; designating
forces to implement NATO's new defence plans; enhancing
interoperability; and speeding up decision-making.

NATO's Innovation Challenges **[Even as some NATO allies develop defense
innovation strategies, NATO faces]{.underline}** a series of
**[obstacles to coordinating these initiatives]{.underline}**,
**[aligning national perspectives]{.underline}**, **[and forging a
unified approach.]{.underline}** Without legal or financial mechanisms
to steer the allies in a particular direction, or the ability to effect
a step change across the alliance, **[NATO relies on its efforts to
build and share knowledge among the allies, set agendas, establish
priorities, and promote multinational cooperation]{.underline}**.
Generally speaking, NATO's innovation challenges relate to  securing
resources for innovation and engaging commercial industry;  balancing
short-term priorities with preparations for the future;  preserving
interoperability and transatlantic burden-sharing;  harmonizing defense
planning processes, including with the EU; and  using allies' diversity
to foster more effective innovation. Resources for Innovation During the
Cold War, the United States and its NATO allies maintained defense
spending and investment levels sufficient to ensure their military
technological superiority. Large U.S. public investment programs in
technology and innovation supported U.S. economic success and spurred
innovation. 128 The U.S. government was a driver for innovation through
the internet, biotech, and shale gas, for example, in part because of
its willingness to invest in early stages of the innovation cycle.129
Analysts have concluded that long-term government funding for defense
and civilian R&D are key ingredients for the development of dual-use
technology. 130 Since the end of the Cold War, however, the United
States shifted attention away from government-led innovation and toward
"consumption markets."131 As a result it faces new challenges that
relate to cost pressures, limited budgets, the shift from "defense
spin-offs to consumer-market spin-ons" in technology, and rising
international competition. 132 Since 2014, NATO allies have been
increasing their defense spending and investment budgets, with Canada
and the European allies spending more on defense in 2017 for the third
consecutive year.133 In addition to more funding, NATO has other
strengths to leverage, including hosting high-performing universities
and research labs as well as dynamic and open economies that attract
talent. These strengths could potentially give NATO access to a wide
network of innovative entrepreneurs and ideas. At the same time,
however, European governments continue to be constrained by relatively
limited budget environments and resources for defense R&D. The budgetary
context that allowed for the Third Offset Strategy in the United States,
for example, does not exist anywhere in Europe. For some European
governments, relatively small increases in defense spending require a
convincing political narrative. Even then, the resources devoted to
defense are often allocated toward more pressing short-term priorities
such as readiness and current operations. **[Relatively limited budgets
combined with NATO's bureaucratic processes and a risk-averse culture
are likely to continue to present challenges for NATO in its efforts to
build relationships with large technology companies or other sources of
innovation]{.underline}**. NATO's capacity has also been reduced over
time through reductions to the command structure.134 Defense Ministers
recently agreed to reverse the downsizing trend by introducing two new
military command centers, but the new staff is expected to focus on
maritime security, troop movements, and contingency planning for Eastern
and Southern Europe. Transatlantic burden-sharing continues to be a
priority for the Trump Administration. While European allies are
increasing their defense budgets, they are unlikely to close the
capabilities gap with the United States any time soon because that gap
reflects decades of spending patterns as well as historical experience
and strategic culture. 140 The risk is that **[the gap could deepen if
the United States continues to pursue a technology-driven strategy and
Europeans do not, or if the United States moves faster than its NATO
allies on fielding new technologies]{.underline}**. 141 In particular, a
**[technology gap could present challenges to the interoperability of
NATO forces]{.underline}**, especially if the future battlefield demands
faster decisionmaking, more rapid troop movements, or an immediate
response to a crisis situation in close proximity to or even inside NATO
territory. NATO officials are working on processes to integrate national
technologies and assets into NATO networks and structures, and they are
evaluating how those networks could be tested in a crisis situation.142
As technology advances and international competition grows, this
challenge could become both more difficult and more important for NATO.
It could also increase the pressure on NATO to ensure that technology
transfer moves in both directions across the Atlantic, as **[there is a
conviction in Europe that not only should European militaries "buy
American," but NATO should help European companies gain access to the
U.S. defense market, too]{.underline}**. 143

**[If the allies are not careful, domestic contentions and international
disputes over]{.underline}** trade and **[technology
regulation]{.underline}** **[could consume their political energy,
breaking the promise of transatlantic renewal before it has even
begun]{.underline}**. To stave off this dim prospect, **[NATO is
embarking on a strategy of transatlantic renewal, the centerpiece of
which will be a new Strategic Concept]{.underline}**---its first in a
decade. NATO's current Strategic Concept dates back to 2010 and reflects
NATO's thinking on how to cope with the divisive nature of the War on
Terror, and it is inadequate for a changed world of great power rivalry.
A new Strategic Concept has long been on the agenda in the corridors of
NATO diplomacy, but no one dared open this Pandora's Box during the
Trump presidency. Following the November 2020 US presidential elections,
NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stepped forward to sketch a
calendar for strategic change: a mandate for a Strategic Concept review
from the NATO heads of state and government in mid-2021, leading to
their agreement on a new Strategic Concept in mid-2022.2 The virtue of
this calendar is that it runs with the positive momentum of change
inherent in the Biden presidency and concludes after German (October
2021) and French (April--May 2022) elections, with the timing ending
before Stoltenberg's mandate as Secretary General expires in September
2022. Stoltenberg has in fact been building up this momentum for change
through 2020, having gained a mandate from a NATO Leaders Meeting in
December 2019 to frame a "forward-looking reflection process" to
strengthen NATO's political dimension and consultation mechanisms.3 The
reflection process---run by 10 experts under Stoltenberg's
guidance---was rebranded as the NATO 2030 initiative last March,
complete with a slick new promotional campaign to spur public debate and
interest in the alliance's work. The experts' report was made public in
early December 2020: it too called for a review of the Strategic
Concept, including a significant upgrade to NATO's "political
dimension." 4 **[NATO is]{.underline}** thus **[confronted with the
choice of whether to merely update its old Strategic Concept from 2010
or do a 360 degree top-to-bottom review of it. A simple update would
entail a broad focus on a growing range of "core tasks" running on
parallel tracks]{.underline}**. Stoltenberg has indicated a preference
for this option, which is reflective of a complex and unwieldy security
environment.5 But more of the same **[carries a risk of diluting NATO
both politically and militarily: it would fragment NATO's political
focus, leave the deterrence of Russia incomplete, and fail to define
collective defense interests in regard to China.]{.underline}** In other
words, **[there is a real risk that NATO will seek the wrong kind of
renewal: going "broad and shallow" by taking on more tasks and/or
elevating existing missions]{.underline}**, like counterterrorism, to
sit alongside collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative
security as "core tasks" of equal importance, as it did when it elevated
the latter two mandates in 2010.6 **[NATO should instead go "narrow and
deep" on collective defense, recommitting itself to its original purpose
of deterring and defending against systemic rivals.]{.underline}**

WHERE TO FOCUS COOPERATION? After agreeing on the technologies to
prioritize, **[allies will need to decide how to direct their efforts
along the technology development chain and what substantive issues to
focus on]{.underline}**. There are opportunities to expand cooperation
across a range of activities, **[from research collaboration to joint
financing]{.underline}**. In roundtables and conversations with experts
conducted by the CSIS Economics Program as part of this project, **[two
cross-cutting issues repeatedly came up: data and
standards]{.underline}**. Focusing allied efforts on aligning approaches
in these two areas would make a significant contribution to joint
promotion of critical technologies. After agreeing on the technologies
to prioritize, allies will need to decide how to direct their efforts
along the technology development chain and what substantive issues to
focus on. Data In 2020, the world generated some 44 zettabytes of
data---"40 times more bytes than there are stars in the observable
universe." Data are everywhere, fueling technology and informing our
decisions and innovation choices. In biotechnology, for example, data
analytics help biopharmaceutical researchers identify drug candidates
for early-stage testing and drug development. Progress in AI development
is largely a function of data and the computing power to process it.
These and similar innovations are dependent on data quantity, quality,
and diversity---how much data one has, how accurate and usable those
data are, and how many different types of data are available. As the
Global Data Alliance, an industry coalition, notes, greater data
quantity allows researchers and firms to "identify meaningful insights,
patterns, and connections that can aid R&D teams in discovering and
developing novel solutions to scientific and technical challenges."
Access to high-quality data enables faster, more reliable discoveries.
Data diversity helps researchers and firms broaden these discoveries,
applying them to new products, patients, and processes. Data are
essential to allied technology efforts for the seemingly simple reason
that sharing data is beneficial. Sharing increases the quantity of data
and therefore the potential for new discoveries. But it also improves
the quality of data, by allowing entities to verify their data against
data held by others and to inform, supplement, and complement their
data. Sharing data can also increase the diversity of data sets,
allowing researchers and producers to apply their results to a wider
range of products and demographics. This is especially important in the
development of AI, where access to different types of data allows
machines to make better decisions. For all the benefits of data sharing,
a number of frictions impede allied cooperation in this area. These
include national laws and policies to protect the privacy and security
of sensitive data. Every government has a legitimate interest in
ensuring that sensitive personal, business, and government information
does not get into the wrong hands, and law and policy in this area
nearly always restrict the use and sharing of this data in some ways.
The problem is when these restrictions inhibit reasonable, responsible,
and ethical data sharing with organizations in like-minded countries
involved in joint research projects. There are emerging differences in
national philosophies and regulatory approaches to data privacy and
security that complicate, or may preclude, allied data sharing in
support of joint promotion of critical technologies. As mentioned
earlier, the European Union considers personal data privacy a human
right and has put into law what is arguably the global standard for data
protection in its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Several
other countries have enacted data laws based on GDPR, including South
Korea and India. For its part, the United States has a patchwork of
privacy rules at the state and sectoral level but no comprehensive
federal legislation in this area. By contrast, data security has taken
on new salience in Washington, as highlighted by President Biden's
signing of an executive order in this area in June. How this will affect
Washington's historic position that data should generally flow freely
across borders remains to be seen. Meanwhile, several allied and partner
countries have also enacted data localization policies, which require
data to be stored domestically. This can silo data within states, impede
data flows, and undermine innovation. According to a report by the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), as of 2020, 62
countries had enacted 144 data localization policies. Many governments
such as the European Union and South Korea claim that data localization
is necessary to protect "important" or "sensitive" data from being
shared; U.S. financial regulators take a similar view with respect to
financial data. However, localization policies are often broadly applied
and seem to be less about legitimate protection than about
protectionism. Efforts to bridge the differences among allies on data
flows, privacy, and security have so far had mixed success. Japan has
usefully put forward the concept of "data free flow with trust (DFFT)"
and won both G7 and G20 endorsement of the idea, but it has yet to be
turned into an agreed set of rules and practices. To facilitate data
flows across the Atlantic, the United States and the European Union
negotiated a "privacy shield" in 2016, providing a mechanism for
companies to comply with GDPR regulations when transferring data from
Europe to the United States. However, in 2020, the European Court of
Justice found that the framework failed to meet GDPR standards and
subsequently invalidated the policy. Without a replacement framework,
transatlantic technology cooperation will be constrained. More
positively, as detailed in a CSIS report in April 2021, there has been
useful work on developing agreed approaches to data governance in a
number of recent trade agreements, particularly among U.S. partners in
the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
incorporates and builds on commitments to substantially free
cross-border data flows and other rules the United States won agreement
to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before it pulled out in early
2017. Similar provisions were included in the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade
Agreement concluded in 2019. And Singapore has been a leader in aligning
data governance policies through its bilateral trade agreements, in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and through its
innovative DEPA arrangement. Moving forward, to capitalize on the
innovation gains that come from sharing data and promote meaningful
allied technology cooperation, the Biden administration should focus on
several lines of effort to reconcile the divergent approaches to data
governance among its key allies. First, it should work with Congress to
enact comprehensive federal privacy legislation. Second, it should use
the new TTC forum with the European Union to align transatlantic
positions on data privacy, security, and flows. Third, it should embrace
the work on data governance in the Asia-Pacific region, starting by
docking onto DEPA. And fourth, it should work to identify areas where
U.S. agencies can pool data with like-minded countries in the interest
of conducting joint research on issues of mutual concern. (For example,
NIST could combine data with UK or EU counterparts to improve the
accuracy of facial recognition tests.) These efforts will help improve
the quantity, quality, and diversity of allied data sets, enabling
greater innovation opportunities for allied researchers and firms in
critical sectors such as AI, biotech, semiconductors, and
telecommunications. Standards **[The term "standards" is used to
describe a broad array of rules, metrics, and norms, ranging from
ubiquitous technical specifications like Bluetooth to safety
requirements such as the warning labels found on lawn mowers to expected
approaches that establish a certain baseline such as in accounting
standards]{.underline}**. In all these variations, standards convey a
sense of expectation of performance. There are broadly **[two types of
standards]{.underline}**: **[consensus standards and technical
regulations]{.underline}**. Consensus standards are the outcomes of
processes where general agreement rather than unanimity is sought and
the development of such outcomes is voluntary. Technical regulations
refer to the use of standards by the government to meet a specific
policy objective and where conformance with the standard is mandatory.
Standards are critical to innovation for two reasons: first, they
provide a foundation for technology development upon which product
differentiation can be made, which makes it easier to deploy competitive
products, including by leveraging first-mover advantages; and second,
they boost product interoperability and consumer confidence in
technologies, expanding existing technology markets and helping to
create new ones. The focus here is mainly on voluntary standards
because, as with data governance, there is arguably more work to be done
to align allied approaches. Global standards are typically set in a
broad range of bodies that are open to participation by all interested
stakeholders and where decisionmaking is done by consensus. Examples of
such as bodies include the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP),
and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
Participants in these bodies include a mix of government and
private-sector researchers and other experts from the member countries.
The process for reaching agreement on standards varies by organization,
with different thresholds in balloting that help establish consensus. As
is the case with data governance, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its allies have different approaches to
standard setting]{.underline}**. While government agencies such as the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of
Defense, and the Department of Transportation participate in many
standard-setting bodies, **[Washington does not lead in setting
technical standards.]{.underline}** It is the long-standing **[policy of
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to allow the
private sector to]{.underline}** take the **[lead]{.underline}**,
leveraging the extensive technical expertise and experience available in
industry and its knowledge of market need and demands. **[This
private-sector--led approach---in which the U.S. government participates
as a contributor, user, and enforcer---has helped establish and maintain
U.S. industrial and tech]{.underline}**nological **[leadership since
World War II]{.underline}**. **[By contrast, governments in
Europe]{.underline}** and Asia tend to **[have a top-down approach to
standard setting]{.underline}**, **[establishing standardization
priorities]{.underline}** and attempting to develop and protect domestic
champions. In order to achieve these objectives, these governments often
send a large number of officials to push for preferred national
outcomes. While there is a strong case for the U.S. government to step
up its long-term game in international standard setting---for example,
by investing in and adequately resourcing government experts to
participate in global standards work---**[the likelihood
that]{.underline}** the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its allies will align their approaches
in standard-setting bodies is low]{.underline}**. In addition to the
philosophical differences**[, these countries are also competitors and
want their own companies and tech]{.underline}**nologies **[to
"win"]{.underline}** in **[the marketplace]{.underline}**. **[There are
numerous examples of such competition in emerging
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[such as]{.underline}** cloud computing,
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}**, and advanced manufacturing. Moreover,
the industry-led U.S. approach, with its competitive dynamics among
actors who have a better sense of the market potential of new
technologies than governments, arguably has real advantages over the
top-down approach used by Europe and other allies.

**[NATO\'s]{.underline}** first **[Strategic Concept]{.underline}** Of
1949 always served more than just one purpose. Today, we argue, the
document has at least three major functions: two internal and one
external. One Of its internal functions is to **[codify past decisions
and practices]{.underline}** **[and thus]{.underline}** **[solidify the
Alliance\'s foundation]{.underline}**. **[Codification is akin to
vacuum-clean- ing]{.underline}**, as one senior NATO official put it:
**[a new Strategic Concept summarizes and formalizes the string Of
ministerial communiqués and lesser decisions that have emerged since the
last Strategic Concept]{.underline}**. 5 **[Every ministerial communiqué
is in fact a miniature Strategic Concepts]{.underline}** the official
argued, and **[from time to time real world events will have driven NATO
so far down new paths that it is necessary to gather all the miniatures
and combine them in one overarching document. The exercise is meant to
provide coherence to a record of decisions and engagements that may not
always be coherent at first sight]{.underline}**. \"**[This points us to
another internal function, namely that of providing new strategic
direction --- Of laying down the foundation for future coherence.
Strategic direction]{.underline}** was a crucial purpose of the Cold War
Concepts, of course, and it **[remains essential]{.underline}**, albeit
**[in a]{.underline}** new **[context of]{.underline}** public diplomacy
(see below) and **[codifica- tion.]{.underline}** It is in fact
difficult to disentangle these functions. **[Strategic direction
concerns most fundamentally the basic values Of the Washington Treaty
and their defense in global and regional contexts]{.underline}**, which
is also where this section began. \"**[The allies must]{.underline}**
basically **[provide strategic direction]{.underline}** **[by defining
the balance between regional and global engagements, the type of threats
the alliance is likely to encounter, and what it can do about
them.]{.underline}** In providing answers to these questions, and thus
providing strategic direction, the Alliance inevitably conducts public
diplomacy. Moreover, to move the world, the Alliance needs a place to
stand, and so strategic direction begins where codification ends.

#### Smaller policies like the plan get codified in NATO's strategic concept -- failure to prioritize overstretches the alliance and makes it ineffective.

Historically, **[NATO's Strategic Concepts have]{.underline}** served
multiple purposes. Firstly and most importantly, they have **[provided
the Alliance with strategic direction]{.underline}**: **[they have
prioritised threats, fundamental tasks and geographical points of
concern, and established guidelines for the force posture of
tomorrow.]{.underline}** Secondly, **[NATO's Strategic Concepts have
codified lesser, piecemeal decisions and appraisals of the strategic
environment most often articulated in ministerial communiqués and summit
declarations. As such, the concepts have been backward-looking,
justifying past decisions and choices.]{.underline}** Thirdly,
**[the]{.underline}** unclassified post-Cold War **[concepts have been
vehicles of public diplomacy, conveying the purpose of the
Alliance.]{.underline}** NATO has adopted three concepts since 1989, and
all have consciously been crafted to sell the Alliance to the public.
Finally, **[NATO's Strategic Concepts have served an important
processual purpose. By compelling allies to confront and discuss vexing
strategic issues, the process leading to the approval of a new concept
-- at its best -- facilitates compromise and a unity of thought and
purpose.]{.underline}**3 In February 2021, Stoltenberg outlined seven
broad areas he sees as key to the process of renovating the Strategic
Concept.4 His 'Food for Thought Paper' may be seen as an opening shot,
but our assessment is that **[an Atlantic Alliance committed to a new
Strategic Concept must make bold decisions both to confront a new world
order and to correct past weaknesses. Given that Russia and China have
become the chief threats to NATO, the Strategic Concept should focus on
these two countries and lay out the implications of their policies and
activities for NATO priorities across tasks and regions]{.underline}**.
Put differently, a **[future concept without a hierarchy of threats and
tasks will be unfit for purpose]{.underline}**. Yet **[NATO comes to
this project with a distinct degree of in-house political--military
tension.]{.underline}** Since 2017, **[the Alliance's military
authorities have crafted significant new strategic documents without
clear political or grand-strategic guidance.]{.underline}** To be sure,
ministerial and summit communiqués have guided the military,5 but the
political--military dialogue stopped short in 2016 and now needs to be
revitalised. The new concept should not only address these issues but do
so in a form that offers a compelling strategic narrative of why the
citizens of NATO countries are well served by an alliance whose members
collectively spend more than \$1,000 billion on defence.

**[After years of transatlantic stress, officials and observers in
Brussels believe that a Biden administration holds the prospect of
profound change in style and policy. There will continue to be areas of
disagreement. But the overall approach from Washington is sure to be
more engaging and closer to mainstream European policy
preferences.]{.underline}** **[From]{.underline}** economics to
**[security]{.underline}**, **[Europe values predictability in U.S.
leadership,]{.underline}** something that has been in remarkably short
supply under the Trump administration. The anticipated shift is likely
to be most profound from the perspective of the EU and its institutions.
Among member states, there was always a spectrum of views about Donald
Trump. The outgoing administration's approach enjoyed a degree of
support in right-wing and nationalist circles, including several
governments in Central and Eastern Europe. For some, this was a matter
of ideology. For others it was a cooler geopolitical calculus. In
general, however, **[the Trump administration was derided for its brash
unilateral style]{.underline}** as much as its policy choices, most of
which were at odds with EU preferences. The list of sharp differences
ranged from climate policy to trade, from Iran to the World Health
Organization. Above all, Trump and his key advisors were seen as
dismissive of, or even opposed to, the idea of the EU itself. For them,
international politics seemed to be about nation states, often
individual leaders---some seen positively, most seen negatively. The
traditional U.S. attachment to the "European project" had become the
preserve of a foreign policy elite with little influence on Trump and
his circle. A **[Biden administration should spell a return to the
traditional balance in transatlantic relations, with the EU itself taken
seriously again alongside relations with France, Germany, and
others.]{.underline}** On substance, there is a realization that it may
not all be smooth sailing across the Atlantic. Trade and digital policy
are widely assumed to be the most challenging areas. Indeed, there is
some concern that Biden may find it difficult to move away from the
protectionist stance that has taken hold in recent years, against the
backdrop of similar pressures in Europe and elsewhere. On other fronts,
the outlook is for closer consultation and convergence. EU leaders will
welcome a U.S. return to the Paris climate accords and the World Health
Organization. Biden has signaled a desire to bring the United States
back into the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran. A Biden
administration is assumed to be more interested in and willing to assist
with a host of problems on Europe's periphery, from Africa to the
Eastern Mediterranean. In some respects, NATO was one of the areas least
affected by Trump's approach to the world. The U.S. military presence in
Europe has grown modestly but steadily; a trend that began under
President Barack Obama. U.S. complaints about defense burden-sharing
were nothing new, even if the style was more abrasive. But from the
start, **[Trump spread anxiety about the solidity of the U.S. commitment
to European defense]{.underline}**. It never quite came to a disavowal
of Article V, and Trump would have faced a very tough bipartisan battle
if he ever wished to leave NATO as he hinted on more than one occasion.
By contrast, **[it is assumed that a Biden administration would put NATO
back at the core of U.S. strategy]{.underline}**. In policy terms, the
emphasis on increased European defense spending will surely continue.
There will be a tougher and more predictable line on Russia, coupled
with an interest in new arms-control arrangements. Biden is a well-known
figure in NATO circles. For the alliance, a Biden administration will be
a return to the known world and an energizing element for the
institution.

**[NATO is at arguably the most important juncture in its post-Cold War
history]{.underline}**. **[NATO must adapt]{.underline}** not only its
military preparedness but also **[its approach to]{.underline}** the
nonmilitary---and specifically **[illiberal---challenges that Russia and
China pose to its resilience and cohesion]{.underline}**. To advance
their geopolitical interests, Russia and China exploited the openness of
society in NATO allies and the divisions between them over the past
decade. NATO must always be wary of external challenges that could
undermine its unity. This was true during the Cold War in the face of an
ideological rival seeking to undermine confidence in Western democratic
governments, and it remains true in the face of Russia and China today.
Conversely, **[NATO needs to navigate its adaptation to its illiberal
challenge while avoiding functional over-extension]{.underline}**.
**[The alliance is at risk of maladaptation]{.underline}**, **[whereby
it extends its own activities]{.underline}** **[unnecessarily into
civilian areas of security in which it lacks necessary expertise and
legacy]{.underline}**. Strong voices in the expert community call for
NATO to specify resilience as a core task in the forthcoming Strategic
Concept, in principle elevating it to a task of equal importance to
collective defense. **[An influential report]{.underline}** commissioned
by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to inspire the Strategic Concept
**[recommends that NATO reinvent itself]{.underline}** as a "liberal
bulwark" against Russia and China **[and extend the alliance's
responsibilities into the realm of democratic resilience. NATO must
steer clear of the temptation to take on too many tasks and instead
enhance resilience only in areas that can be reconciled with its mandate
as a security and defense alliance]{.underline}**. The encounter with
illiberal powers strengthens NATO's unity, but that does not necessarily
mean that NATO is the right institution to meet the illiberal challenges
that Russia and China pose. So far, the alliance's record of responding
to these threats has been uneven, and the **[perspectives about its role
have diverged]{.underline}** at times **[between]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and its European partners]{.underline}**. But **[there is a way

Analyses of transatlantic relations, and security relations in
particular, often focus on differences between the United States and its
European allies. This clearly is an important factor. Given Europe's
dependence on US security guarantees, the United States' continued
willingness to engage in the continent's security is the condition sine
qua non for NATO's survival. US dissatisfaction with European engagement
and defense spending has consequently been a key item on intra-Alliance
agendas since 1949. US concerns about NATO and its European allies'
engagement were indeed voiced openly long before Donald Trump.1 Debates
about burden sharing also trickle down to domestic politics in member
states and thus contribute to shaping the general climate within the
Alliance, as for instance the 2 percent objective that has featured in
several German electoral campaigns. **[It is]{.underline}**, however,
equally **[important not to overlook structural differences among
European Allies]{.underline}**. When the Reflection Group appointed by
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg published its report on "NATO 2030"
in late 2020, it was no coincidence that **[Alliance cohesion was among
the key points]{.underline}**.2 Indeed, **[disagreements among Allies
have increased in recent years]{.underline}**---to the point of famously
prompting French president Emmanuel Macron to declare NATO "brain dead"
because it is no longer able to adopt common views on key strategic
matters.3 This notably pertains to the role Turkey has been playing in
recent years and intra-Alliance rivalries. Other examples include
Allies' difficulties to develop a common stance on Libya and different
views on NATO's potential role in the Arctic. The latter example is
linked to what is certainly the single most important aspect for
Euro-Atlantic security in the 21st century: the Alliance and its
members' relationship 157158 nato 2030: towards a new strategic concept
and beyond with Russia. Yet, regarding Russia in particular, ideas on
the way ahead vary widely across NATO capitals. **[What is ultimately at
stake are diverging approaches to European and Euro-Atlantic security at
large, based on different interpretations of the future direction of the
global security environment]{.underline}**. The three **[most relevant
issues most likely to trouble NATO]{.underline}** in the coming decade
**[may]{.underline}** thus **[be]{.underline}** summarized as, first,
**[disagreements among member states on concrete policy
issues]{.underline}**, most prominently illustrated by Turkey's current
foreign policies and its consequences for Alliance cohesion. Second,
Allies continue and will continue to hold **[divergent threat
perceptions]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** consequently place
**[different emphases on security challenges and defense
priorities]{.underline}**. Third, there is no consensus among European
Allies on whether US security guarantees can be considered a viable
option in the years and decades to come. Against this backdrop, this
chapter aims at showing that '**[Europe' is by no means a monolithic
bloc or actor in its own right, but rather a group of states sometimes
pursuing different and even incompatible perspectives]{.underline}**. In
particular, on the Western side of the Atlantic, references to 'Europe'
as an actor in transatlantic security relations are a frequent
phenomenon. **[Any analysis or future policy based on the assumption
that Europeans are unified in security will, however, be erroneous and
impracticable]{.underline}**. As the ongoing debate on European
strategic autonomy has notably revealed, the primary reason is that
Europeans lack a joint vision on how to ensure their continent's
security in the future. As this chapter argues, insights gained from
this debate pertain to the very fundamentals of European security,
beyond petty debates on semantics. **[Allies' increased difficulties to
come to shared views in fact stem from very different takes on the
foundational features of European security and divergent readings of
structural evolutions in the international system]{.underline}**.
However, the problem is not only that diverging visions confront each
other. Rather, **[some European governments simply do not
have]{.underline}** such **[a vision, cling to the status quo,
and]{.underline}** sometimes even **[refuse to think about the
possibility that things may have to evolve]{.underline}**. These
differences come on top of other divergences on issues such as democracy
and the rule of law, including within the European Union, involving

The abovementioned **[incidents have led cyber-conflict scholars to
point to several technical and practical difficulties in the operational
integration of cyber effects]{.underline}**.29 In the interviews and
background conversations that contributed to this study, three of these
**[difficulties were continuously reiterated when discussing successful
integration of cyber effects into NATO operational planning: the
temporal dimension of developing exploits; the assessment of battle
damage; and the problem of confliction.]{.underline}** Developing
exploits---a matter of time One of the characteristics of cyber attacks
that receives most attention is the fact that they hit suddenly and
without warning.30 While this is often the case, the central question
for operational integration is not the speed at which they hit their
target, but the speed with which the tools and techniques that exploit
IT vulnerabilities in order to deliver cyber effects can be developed.
Like conventional weapons, **[the cyber tools---the exploits or cyber
weapons---take time to develop.]{.underline}** However, **[an exploit is
often harder to reuse than a conventional weapon, as it is more
dependent on a meticulous analysis and target preparation---in this
case, specifically, the target's IT infrastructure. Without knowing the
adversary's IT systems and its vulnerabilities better than the adversary
itself, meaningful cyber weapons are impossible to develop. The fact
that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the deployment of
a weapon but also to its development influences the extent to which it
can be used and reused]{.underline}**. Stuxnet, for example, required
years of development, testing and perfecting before it could deliver the
intended effect on the Iranian centrifuges. Despite the techniques used
in the Stuxnet malware having been found in other malware,31 Stuxnet
lost its ability to destroy the centrifuges when it was discovered and
the IT vulnerabilities that enabled it were patched. Importantly, part
of the complexity of Stuxnet relates to the US--Israeli intention to
keep the effect secret. **[In a hot conflict, secrecy in terms of the
effect is often less important, and thus the development and deployment
of cyber effects do not necessarily have to be as complex and
time-consuming.]{.underline}** This observation does not necessarily
change the fact that the development of exploits often has to precede
the military confrontation in which they are intended to be used**[.
NATO states that want to deliver cyber effects in NATO operations must
try to gain access to Russia's or other potential adversaries' critical
military networks to identify and exploit IT
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. As several informants emphasized, if
states wait for a conflict to escalate before they begin the development
of exploits, it is most likely to be already too late.32 **[The
alternative to penetrating adversary networks in peacetime is for states
to rely on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many commercial
off-the-shelf products as possible]{.underline}**. This can be done, for
example, **[by purchasing exploits from private companies offering this
service, in the hope that it will then be possible to quickly create an
overview of the enemy's IT infrastructure and adapt the exploits to this
environment when a conflict escalates.]{.underline}** **[The latter
approach is more likely to succeed against adversaries with low network
security, which does not apply in the case of Russia, or in contexts
where less sophisticated and less closely targeted cyber effects are
required. Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for
future targeted effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more
minor effects, they cannot]{.underline}**---as several informants
indicated---**[be certain that they will be able to deliver the cyber
effect at the specific time it is requested]{.underline}** by CYOC.
**[This is because the IT vulnerabilities upon which exploits depend
might not exist for ever. Cyberspace is a dynamic environment:
vulnerabilities are patched, systems are updated or replaced and bad IT
security practices are identified and improved]{.underline}**. This
means that **[exploits are temporary]{.underline}** in nature **[and
cannot be stored for later]{.underline}** use.33 States must constantly
ensure that the exploits still work, which requires minor adjustments
when updates take place. **[As a consequence, the larger the military
'cyber arsenal', the more technically skilled human resources are needed
for its maintenance. In the current labour market, where recruitment and
retention of a cyber workforce is difficult, extensive investment is
required for states to be able to stand ready with cyber effects
available when requested.]{.underline}** In short, **[if a state is to
offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation, then the state is likely to
have to be able, first, to predict what Russian IT systems it is going
to target months or years in advance, and second, to marshal the
necessary resources to develop and maintain a large array of exploits
that can be used against these systems. Even if this is successfully
done, the state still faces difficulty in ensuring that an effect is
delivered as promised.]{.underline}**

Defense Pledge. That's a Bad Idea.\" POLITICO,

President Joe Biden has issued grave warnings that Russia might launch a
cyberattack against the United States in retaliation for the punishing
sanctions levied after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. He's advised
American companies to "accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"
and many officials expect an attack against critical U.S. infrastructure
to be inevitable. One way Biden and other Western leaders are attempting
to deter potential Russian cyber retaliation during the Ukraine crisis
is through NATO's Article 5 collective defense pledge --- that an attack
on one is an attack against all. That's because since the 2014 NATO
summit in Wales (which, coincidentally, took place following another
Russia-Ukraine crisis), the alliance has affirmed that Article 5 extends
to cyberspace. In other words, a cyberattack against any NATO member
could conceivably represent an attack against the entire alliance. The
pledge is the embodiment of the allies' security guarantee to each other
and the beating heart of NATO. After Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that NATO policy on
collective defense and cyberspace holds strong, noting that NATO has
"decided to make clear that a cyberattack can trigger Article 5." And
following an extraordinary meeting of heads of state and government on
March 24, the alliance reinforced that it is "ready to impose costs on
those who harm us in cyberspace." But despite this rhetoric, exactly how
and when Article 5 applies to cyberspace remains unclear. This ambiguity
is a problem --- with potentially disastrous consequences. Staking the
credibility of Article 5 to what are often murky activities in
cyberspace threatens to undermine the broader principle of collective
defense. We can't risk fracturing the transatlantic alliance at a
critical juncture in its history over a debate on what constitutes a
major or minor cyberattack. For that reason, NATO should move quickly to
clarify its policy on cyberattacks and explicitly state the threshold
for what would trigger an Article 5 response. Furthermore, **[NATO
members should commit to treating]{.underline}**
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** that do **[not]{.underline}** rise to the
level of a **[major attack as a national matter --- not one for the
alliance. Such a shift might face some initial
resistance]{.underline}**, particularly in light of the Kremlin's
history of malicious cyber activities. One of the first state-initiated
cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia against Estonia, a NATO member,
in 2007. In the intervening years, Moscow has increased its malicious
cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered in December
2020 in which Russia gained access to a treasure trove of U.S. data.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO members, along
with the annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the alliance to adopt a
Cyber Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized cyberspace as a military
domain. Two years later, NATO created a Cyberspace Operations Center in
Mons, Belgium to improve situational awareness and coordinate cyber
operations. Since then, the alliance has consistently reaffirmed the
application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At the 2021 summit in Brussels,
NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber Defense Policy, with allies
agreeing to employ the "full range of capabilities" at all times to
"deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats."
Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." In
practice, however, NATO leaders have avoided clarifying the conditions
under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5 and how NATO would
respond. When pressed about Russian cyberattacks in the Ukraine context,
Stoltenberg cautioned that, "we have never gone into the position where
we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we
trigger Article 5." This equivocation is not surprising, for several
reasons. **[The nature of cyberspace often confounds unequivocal
deterrence declarations. States tend to operate in cyberspace with
plausible deniability, which can make it difficult to rapidly ascertain
responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}**. Also, **[it can be
challenging to understand the intent behind observed cyber behavior, and
there is often a substantial time lag between when an initial
penetration of a network occurs and when the target even realizes the
breach]{.underline}**. And **[the vast majority of cyber operations
cause virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[it can take time to develop and identify a way to
infiltrate a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage
of a vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may lack a
palatable cyber response option for retaliatory purposes at the desired
time.]{.underline}** This creates a slew of practical problems if
Article 5 were to be invoked for a cyberattack. **[From an
implementation perspective, it would trigger deliberations within the
North Atlantic Council]{.underline}**, NATO's primary decision-making
body. **[Decisions made within the NAC]{.underline}** **[require
unanimity, which can be difficult to achieve for many issues but is
especially burdensome for cyber ones, given all of the ambiguities
outlined above. The most likely outcome of this process would be a long,
drawn-out deliberation resulting in a divided alliance unable to agree
on how or whether to respond]{.underline}**. Quite simply, some allies
are unlikely to want to risk World War III for a cyberattack that
disrupts the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another country
but doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage. These challenges
have major strategic implications for NATO. After years of publicly and
repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and reinforcing that policy
in response to the Ukraine conflict, **[a failure to achieve consensus
and respond to]{.underline}** a Russian c**[yberattack]{.underline}**
against a NATO member could imperil Article 5 in other areas. The
**[disunity that is likely to be revealed during NAC deliberations would
then undermine]{.underline}** the **[broader political
cohesion]{.underline}** that has, for the most part, been remarkably
strong throughout the war in Ukraine. This would make it more difficult
for the alliance to respond to other forms of Russian behavior. As Biden
emphasized at a press conference last month, "the single-most important
thing is for us to stay unified ... We have to stay fully, totally,
thoroughly unified." NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its
current cyber policy, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian
assaults during the present crisis. However, rather than an all-out
Russian cyberattack, a far more plausible scenario is a lower-level
attack carried out by the Russian government or a proxy group against
one or more allies. In this case, the alliance's interests --- not to
mention transatlantic security --- would be better served by adopting
nationally-tailored responses rather than pulling the Article 5 lever.
Additionally, to prevent further escalation and reinforce the implicit
firebreak that currently exists between cyber and conventional military
operations, NATO allies should also agree to restrict any retaliatory
response against Moscow to the cyber realm or non-military instruments
of power. With little chance of improved NATO-Russian relations any time
soon, time is of the essence to get this right. **[The allies should
begin the hard political legwork now to ensure members get on the same
page before NATO's June summit,]{.underline}** if not sooner.
**[Achieving consensus on significant cyber issues has previously taken
time]{.underline}**. **[NATO's attribution of the Microsoft Exchange
hack]{.underline}** last summer to China was an important step for the
alliance and sent a strong signal to our adversaries. But **[it took
months to reach agreement on the statement;]{.underline}** the hack was
uncovered in March 2021 and the NATO statement was not made public until
July. In the current crisis, the alliance will not have the luxury of
waiting four (or more) months to agree on a response. To avoid incurring
damaging costs to NATO's credibility and its deterrent powers, the
allies should refine their cyber policy, now. We live in an age in which
more people have access to highly sophisticated technologies and almost
every social, economic or military asset has become 'securitized' or
vulnerable to disruption -- whether temporary or more lasting -- from an
outside attacker or even an inside source.

How likely is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered? The
answer to this question is not clear, in respect of either its
preparation or its execution. This is not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and patched; it is also
because of the difficulty of assessing the effects and possible
side-effects of an exploit when navigating and analysing complex IT
infrastructures. In other words, **[reconnaissance is difficult in
cyberspace, and so is the containment of effects. The Russian attempt to
use ransomware aimed at disrupting critical Ukrainian infrastructure in
2017, for example, succeeded---but simultaneously encrypted computers
globally, causing substantial economic damage to multinational
businesses]{.underline}** such as Maersk and FedEx.34 **[Collateral
damage and unintended consequences are serious issues for NATO. The
alliance takes pride in its adherence to the principles laid out in
international law, such as proportionality and
discrimination]{.underline}**, as former NATO Deputy Assistant
Secretary-General Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 Thus, **[disruptions of
servers with huge negative implications for civilians, or the use of
generic cyber tools that risk spreading their effects far and wide, are
most likely not going to be considered for use in NATO
operations.]{.underline}** Indeed, one of the main challenges to US
efforts to disrupt servers in working against ISIS was finding ways to
ensure that civilians were not hit by their cyber effects.36 **[Another
aspect of the difficulty of assessing the cyber effect relates to
adversaries' cyber defence efforts. For the more sophisticated players
in cyberspace, cyber defence has developed into more than simply
patching, clearing and updating systems. Cyber defence is also
increasingly about following an intruder's activity in one's own network
and creating 'honeypots' or 'honeynets'; or about following data traffic
back to the intruder's network.]{.underline}** In short, **[cyber
defence is also about deception and active defence]{.underline}**.37
This approach to cyber defence offers valuable insights into the
intruder's techniques and strategies; but the mere knowledge that
deception is becoming a predominant defensive strategy also introduces
doubts into the intruder's assessment of possible effects. Consequently,
as **[Russia is considered a peer competitor with considerable
cyber-defensive capacities, one informant expressed scepticism about the
extent to which smaller member states are confident in their ability to
deliver a cyber effect when it is requested by NATO]{.underline}**.38
**[This is especially the case if operational success depends on a
specific effect. Even if a state has developed the appropriate exploit,
it must also be able to verify that the effect is achieved and ensure
that the effect is contained to minimize collateral
damage]{.underline}**. And even if **[a state]{.underline}** is
confident about its current ability to contain and verify an effect, it
**[must also be confident that it can deliver, verify and contain the
effect]{.underline}** at the specific time in the future when CYOC
requests it. **[The process of integration is further complicated by the
fact that NATO must be willing to hand over to contributing states the
responsibility for making battle damage assessments and collateral
damage estimations]{.underline}**. As the following subsection shows,
**[states are generally unwilling to share classified information about
exploits]{.underline}**. Hence, **[the delegated NATO commander is
unlikely to receive much useful information about how cyber effects are
delivered before a decision about their deployment must be
taken.]{.underline}** As commanders would prefer to have control over
the capabilities used, member-state cyber effects are likely choices of
method only if alternative, conventional effects are unavailable.

### Links \-\-- Cyber = Distrust

#### NATO cyberoperations exacerbate distrust between members -- cyber exploits require secrecy which results in allied deconfliction.

**Jacobsen 21** \[Jeppe T. Jacobsen is a Ph.D. candidate at the Danish

The third **[challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to]{.underline}** a well-known military concept,
**[deconfliction]{.underline}**. **[The coordination by allies and
military units of their efforts to avoid confliction, between for
example an air operation and a special forces operation in the same
area, is a central element in every military campaign]{.underline}**.
Deconfliction is all about openness and communication between allied
partners. But **[in cyberspace, deconfliction comes with several
difficulties.]{.underline}** At the core of these difficulties is the
fact that **[the tools and techniques that produce cyber
effects]{.underline}**---which are often also used and heavily depended
on for intelligence collection---**[are developed in secret and must
stay secret until the effect is achieved. If the IT vulnerabilities and
exploits are known, vendors or adversaries can fix or replace the
software and thereby render the effect impossible to
achieve]{.underline}**.39 In an alliance not known for sufficient mutual
trust among members to share intelligence,40 **[there is little
indication that allies will become more open about the cyber tools and
techniques they currently have at their disposal]{.underline}**. The
request-based model is the result of that lack of trust. And **[the
unwillingness to share cyber intelligence seriously challenges NATO's
ambition to]{.underline}** use CYOC to **[facilitate information-sharing
to increase situational awareness and thereby achieve the 'cyber
readiness' and 'cyber resiliency']{.underline}** that NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană hopes to attain.41 Furthermore, **[lack
of coordination and discussion about the use of military cyber
capabilities,]{.underline}** both internally in each state and among
allies, **[can have negative implications for intelligence activities
and general network security]{.underline}**. A **[conventional military
decision to deliver cyber effects is rarely concerned with maintaining
access and staying secret after an effect is achieved]{.underline}**.
Even though it is customary to try to obscure the vulnerabilities that
are being exploited, it is difficult to ensure that those operating the
targeted system or third-party network analysts do not identify and fix
the vulnerabilities in, for example, commercial products used all over
the world. Thus, **[military plans to engage other state entities need
to weigh the benefit of delivering cyber effects against the risk of
losing intelligence capacity, as well as the risk that other actors
(allies, corporations, adversaries, criminals, etc.) will use the same
exploits against oneself.]{.underline}** In other words, **[there is a
conflict of interest between attack, intelligence collection and
internal defence in each NATO member state]{.underline}**.42 The desire
of the US Cyber Command to become more independent from the National
Security Agency (NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a stronger voice
when the US government assesses whether a vulnerability should be
disclosed to vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or used to
deliver 'loud' cyber effects.43 **[The risk of confliction among allies
arises from the fact that a similar assessment procedure does not exist
across NATO]{.underline}**. As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member states.44
**[If the Netherlands, for example, offers to deliver a 'loud' cyber
effect in a NATO operation, British or American intelligence operations
could end up being disturbed because they rely on the same
vulnerabilities which---when used in military operations---risk being
exposed and subsequently fixed.]{.underline}**45 When deploying 'loud'
cyber effects, **[malicious actors such as criminals are also given the
opportunity to identify and exploit the same vulnerabilities in
unpatched systems in allied countries.]{.underline}** The ransomware
incidents known as **[WannaCry and NotPetya are examples of the damage
that can emerge from government exploits becoming publicly
available]{.underline}**---even though the specific vulnerabilities were
already patched by Microsoft and updates released to supported
systems.46 In short, **[there is a dilemma]{.underline}** both
internally, between intelligence agencies and the military, and
externally, **[between allies]{.underline}**. While it is difficult to
do much about the latter, **[the internal power dynamics in most states,
with the intelligence agencies as the primary cyber actors, are likely
to limit the willingness of most states to deliver military cyber
effects---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC makes
requests]{.underline}**. **[They also limit the willingness to share
cyber threat information across the alliance through
CYOC.]{.underline}** This section has pointed to three characteristics
about cyberspace that limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations. **[In a complex and constantly changing cyberspace, it
continues to be difficult to develop and maintain sophisticated exploits
for targeted cyber effects. This is especially the case if the cyber
effects are requested for a specific time and place in order to
guarantee operational success, and if they simultaneously have to be
verifiable and conform to international legal principles]{.underline}**.
Neither the member states, which face an internal dilemma between
attack, intelligence collection and defence in cyberspace, nor the NATO
commander, who will prefer to control the capabilities used, are likely
to feel sufficiently confident about the targeted or highly integrated
cyber effects to choose that option if other capabilities are available.

confidence.]{.underline}** My proposed solution: NATO allies should
establish memoranda of understanding on offensive cyber effects
operations in systems or networks based in allied territory. Objectives
of Out-of-Network Operations in Allied Networks Allied states may
operate in each other's systems or networks in at least three ways: as
an observer, gathering intelligence on adversarial activity in others'
networks; as a passerby, transiting through allied systems and networks
to access a certain adversarial target; or as a disrupter, seeking to
cause friction for an adversary's operation within an ally's network or
system**[. The German case discussed above is the only publicly known
case of a state acting as a disrupter in an allied network. But we can
expect that more of these cases will be publicly disclosed in the
future.]{.underline}** It has now been widely discussed that the U.S.
Cyber Command has undergone a significant shift in strategic thinking
away from deterrence toward persistent engagement and defend forward.
Following these recent changes in strategic thinking, U**[.S. Cyber
Command seeks to cause friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers,"
operating "globally, continuously and seamlessly."]{.underline}** In a
similar vein, NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone
writes in an article for Joint Force Quarterly: "We must ... maneuver
seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as
possible to adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the
battlespace **[to create operational advantage for us while denying the
same to our adversaries."]{.underline}** While one may expect
adversaries to maneuver in allied networks, t**[he U.S.]{.underline}**
is currently the only NATO state **[that makes causing friction in
allied networks a necessary and explicit component of its strategy.
Other military cyber organizations could follow in the near
future]{.underline}**. And we already see countries moving in this
direction. On Aug. 1, the Communications Security Establishment Act
(CSE) came into force in Canada. According to the Canadian government,
"CSE could be authorized to proactively stop or impede foreign cyber
threats before they damage Canadian systems or information holdings, and
conduct online operations to advance national objectives." The Canadian
government does not explicitly talk in its latest strategy about the
need to operate "globally, continuously and seamlessly" or to cause
friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers." In that regard, it needs to
do more strategic thinking---as other countries do---on the exact role
of cyber operations on allied networks in the military context. But the
proposed memorandum of understanding on cyber offense addresses exactly
this possibility.

increased strategic rivalry from rival global power
centre]{.underline}**s. A more **[aggressive cyber posture
can]{.underline}** certainly **[be seen in the establishment of the US
Cyber Command]{.underline}**, a unified and expanding military command
structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber
operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the
Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act,
and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism
programme**[. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by
the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of
ICT specialists employed]{.underline}** to penetrate foreign networks
(Gellman and Nakashima 2013). In 2012, Obama signed Presidential
Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military
the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart
cyber attacks against US systems (Nakashima 2012). **[The wealth of
cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and
associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach
to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US
government.]{.underline}** Mary O Connell takes up this line of
argument, suggesting that the **[US government has become "trapped in an
ideology of militarism"]{.underline}** (O'Connell 2012, p. 191) and
claiming that "the US military today has the largest concentration of
expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace" (O'Connell
2012, p. 187). She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia
attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus,
t**[he US government "began releasing a number of policies on cyber
security that were predominantly military in orientation]{.underline}**"
(O'Connell 2012, p. 188). This would seem to support the line of
argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than
non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue
within the transatlantic security community. **[This hard power approach
to cyber security in the US c]{.underline}**ould also be explained by
the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American
context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could
face a "cyber Pearl Harbour" is a prime example of the securitisation
and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the
highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war
analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and
doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that
clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the
formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks
might be met with conventional attacks; an idea "lifted" from the 1960s
strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might
also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber
security issues. They further argue that "there is a massive amount of
threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers,
most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the
threats" Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in
suggesting that **[a new "cyber industrial complex" is forming in
America]{.underline}**, the huge US government spending on cyber
protection for the federal government, such as a \$1 billion contract
awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may
create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be
militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the
arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime. **[In
Europe]{.underline}**, at least on the surface, **[a softer cyber
security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have
typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with
cyber attacks,]{.underline}** reflecting a European **[preference for
soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in
Europe to militarise cyberspace.]{.underline}** The new **[European
Union Cyber Security Strategy]{.underline}**, for example, **[is based
on promoting norms in cyberspace,]{.underline}** encouraging dialogue
between nations, **[enhancing technical capacity and
resilience]{.underline}**, and fighting cybercrime (Ashton 2013). The
most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in
Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report
cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, **[the strategy is
defensively orientated and non-militaristic.]{.underline}**

**[One]{.underline}** way to explain this is through the existence and
dominance of a largely **[unspoken but widely [accepted
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For decades, **[the [predominant actors in
cyberspace]{.mark} have been [intelligence agencies]{.mark}; and the
norms that characterize interactions between intelligence agencies are
not primarily concerned with military concepts such as conflict
escalation and deterrence]{.underline}**.67 In the world of intelligence
agencies, success is not about keeping a distance between oneself and
the adversary by signalling one's intentions and capabilities. It is
about being able to outmanoeuvre adversaries in a space of constant
contact.68 There are always risks, and **[the work usually takes place
in legal grey zones where a clear distinction between war and peace is
not the guiding principle]{.underline}**. This is an arena where the
opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is taken when it arises.
In short, espionage and counter-espionage do not fit well with the
thorough military operational planning that characterizes NATO
operations. **[Intelligence operations]{.underline}**, on the other
hand, **[fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where anonymity is easy
to achieve and uncertainty a constant condition]{.underline}**.69 The
states that embrace cyberspace as a domain where the intelligence norm
dominates are able to use a broader array of tools to pursue or respond
to various foreign political objectives than only those that relate to
military operations. In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built
implicitly on the dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to
become more agile and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend
forward').70 The United States considers 'constant contact' and
'persistent engagement' as the necessary guiding principles to achieve
superiority in cyberspace and to take full advantage of the broader
potential for pursuing its political objectives through cyberspace.
During the 2018 US midterm elections, for example, the US Cyber Command
worked closely with the NSA to disrupt servers operated by the Russian
Internet Research Agency aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension
in the United States.71 More recently, the US Cyber Command responded
with various cyber effects against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary
Guards apparently placed mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These
practices illustrate that, for the United States, cyber effects provide
political options when one does not want to escalate existing tensions
into military confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies
through CYOC supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing
the possibility that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend
forward' and work persistently through allied networks.73 **[[A more
cyber-active NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[risks being
counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks. [Unintended conflict escalation
from]{.mark} ongoing [cyber activity is mainly a risk if military
analysts]{.mark}---in a strategic environment with heightened attention
to military confrontation---[ignore the dominant intelligence
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If that happens, **[it becomes more likely
that ['persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be
misinterpreted as military preparation, armament or the initial phase of

that has publicly returned to its original raison d'être of deterrence
and collective defence, [becomes the entity that coordinates cyber
effects]{.mark} below the threshold of armed conflict, then [the
likelihood increases that Russia misinterprets these effects as
escalatory and acts accordingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[[a more active NATO]{.mark} in the current strategic environment
[increases]{.mark} the [risk that]{.mark} the existing [intelligence
norm will be undermined and replaced by a more militarized
norm]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The influence of AI on NATO comes with a set of opportunities,
challenges and risks]{.underline}**. **[Its adoption process has
been]{.underline}** **[incremental and prescriptive]{.underline}**. The
rising geopolitical conflicts and the use of AI in such conflicts have
required the establishment of a dynamic ecosystem to support
interoperability. **[The military adoption of AI requires an innovation
ecosystem that is self-sufficient, supports deterrence and
resilience]{.underline}**, and encompasses the strategic innovation
process. **[NATO's AI strategy]{.underline}** raises many concerns
related to the AI-driven autonomous weapon systems, as it **[does
not]{.underline}** adequately **[address]{.underline}** the development
of such systems, **[its deployment and governance]{.underline}**. The AI
strategy mostly talks about the ethical and responsible use of AI and
has omitted the challenges related to the use of lethal autonomous
weapon systems. For the US, its priorities lie in ensuring responsible
use of AI-enabled systems with their allies for operational and data
sharing**[. It remains to be seen if all the 30 NATO states agree on the
same rules]{.underline}** **[and would be willing to agree on practical
guidelines for]{.underline}** the operational **[use of AI-enabled
systems]{.underline}**. Another challenge for NATO is to standardise
rules for all member states in dealing with AI-enabled autonomous weapon
systems. Countries like Turkey are working on autonomous weapons and
have developed AI-enabled loitering munitions. Turkey has requested the
US for upgraded F-16 fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The
Biden Administration has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of
Turkey's F-16 fighter jet fleet.26 Turkey's armed drones have also been
used in the Ukraine conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems, it
will be necessary for all NATO members to have standardised rules when
it comes to deployment of such systems. Also, **[there is no transparent
allocation of roles for different NATO bodies]{.underline}**, **[and "no
dedicated line of funding" for its AI strategy]{.underline}**.27 **[The
finances are shared through multiple funding like NATO Innovation Fund
and DIANA which manages funding for various other projects leading to
uncertainty over availability of funds and budget cuts]{.underline}**.
This will be a significant challenge for the effective implementation of
the AI strategy.28 Some other challenges with the adoption of AI
strategy through innovation include fragmented national innovation
initiatives, allied technological categorisation and digitisation gaps,
speed of adoption and spending levels and the underuse of NATO's
mechanisms to undertake collaborative defence innovation.29

//um-ef)

More broadly, this chapter illustrates that regional and
**[international organizations have high stakes for military AI
governance]{.underline}**. As development, procurement, and
implementation of AI is accelerating, it is imperative that
international organizations facilitate cooperation among states and
industry partners to guide responsible military AI implementation
aligned with core values and legal obligations. The convening and
coordinating power of international organizations, among other
governance tools, is a necessary step for state cooperation and policy
alignment. How exactly NATO interacts with other international
organizations in the security architecture, including the UN and EU, is
a political topic that will also have important implications for the
composition of international technology governance regimes, and is a
subject for further research. On that note **[NATO]{.underline}**, or
any other international organization, **[is not exempt
from]{.underline}** these **[political hurdles]{.underline}**. **[As
EDTs increasingly become a focal point in the geopolitical space, any
approach of AI governance]{.underline}** in the international security
environment **[will have global political undertones]{.underline}**.
**[This will undoubtedly be a significant hurdle for NATO as it balances
responsible AI development and Allied coordination and
cooperation]{.underline}** in a changing geopolitical landscape. And
certainly, **[the political realities may well represent the greatest
challenge and disincentivize NATO to emerge as a leader in responsible
military AI]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the three pillars indicate
that NATO is an institution with considerable opportunity to shape
responsible AI governance. More specifically, this entails urging and
facilitating Allied standards and policies to establish foundations for
emerging military technology built on informed and ethical principles
and enhance the international security environment.

#### AI governance causes massive infighting within the alliance -- divergent priorities between allies makes cohesion impossible and hampers NATO efficacy.

**Heikkila '21** \-- (Melissa Heikkilä, 3-29-2021, \"NATO wants to set
AI standards. If only its members agreed on the basics.,\" POLITICO,

**[On paper, NATO is the ideal organization to go about setting
standards for military applications of artificial intelligence. But the
widely divergent priorities and budgets of its 30 members could get in
the way.]{.underline}** The Western military alliance has identified
artificial intelligence as a key technology needed to maintain an edge
over adversaries, and it wants to lead the way in establishing common
ground rules for its use. "We need each other more than ever. No country
alone or no continent alone can compete in this era of great power
competition," NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the
alliance's second in command, said in an interview with POLITICO. **[The
standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic
oversigh]{.underline}**t. David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of
concern with the tech\'s ethical implications has sped along the
integration of AI into the military apparatus. \"I\'m \... not sure that
they\'re having the same debates on principles of responsible use or
they\'re definitely not applying our democratic values to these
technologies," he said. Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll
out the world\'s first binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is
seeking closer collaboration with Washington to oversee emerging
technologies, including artificial intelligence. But those e**[fforts
have been slow in getting off the ground. F]{.underline}**or Geoană,
that collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working closely with
the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on "high risk"
applications. The **[pitch NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a
standard, it becomes in terms of defensive security the gold standard in
that respective field]{.underline}**," Geoană said. **[The alliance\'s
own AI strategy, to be released before the summer, will identify ways to
operate AI systems responsibly, identify military applications for the
technology, and provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see
whether it\'s up to NATO standards]{.underline}**," van Weel said. The
strategy will also set ethical guidelines around how to govern AI
systems, for example by ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at
all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is
responsible for the actions of AI systems. "If an adversary would use
autonomous AI powered systems in a way that is not compatible with our
values and morals, it would still have defense implications because we
would need to defend and deter against those systems," van Weel said.
"We need to be aware of that and we need to flag legislators when we
feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm of \[being
detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence," he continued. Mission
impossible? **[The problem is that NATO\'s members are at very different
stages when it comes to thinking about AI in the military context. The
U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use of
AI in the defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and
the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense
and military implications in their national AI
strategies.]{.underline}** "It's absolutely no surprise that the **[U.S.
had a military AI strategy before it has a national AI strategy,\" but
the Europeans \"did it exactly the other way around]{.underline}**,\"
said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, said: That **[echoes familiar transatlantic
differences]{.underline}** --- and previous U.S. President Donald
Trump\'s complaints --- **[over defense spending, but also highlights
the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.]{.underline}**
The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently. **[There are also
divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to develop,
including lethal autonomous weapons systems --- often dubbed "killer
robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy targets without human
control. Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S.
have developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons,
while others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns
about the technology.]{.underline}** These weapons systems have also
faced fierce public opposition from civil society and human rights
groups, including from United Nations Secretary-General António
Guterres, who in 2018 called for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has
"retained autonomous weapon systems as part of the interests of NATO."
The group hopes that its upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical
use of the technology without "stifling innovation." Staying relevant
**[These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting
drive.]{.underline}** \"I think there's a certain danger that if NATO
doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it may be marginalized by
other such efforts," Franke said. She pointed to the U.S.-led AI
Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries from Europe and
Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context --- a forum which
could supplant NATO as the standard-setting body. That could have
consequences for human rights, too. "NATO... is a great place to
responsibly think about how to harness the good parts of this technology
and how to prohibit the parts that would be catastrophic for
humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at the end of the
day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty International,
which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign. "Without oversight
mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures, which would
guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful human
control" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum," Coyle
said. Franke **[said it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the
basics,]{.underline}** like increased data sharing to develop and train
military AI and cooperating on using artificial intelligence in
logistics. "If NATO countries were to cooperate on that, that could
create good procedures and set precedents. And I think we should then
move on to the more controversial things such as autonomous weapons
systems," she said.

complexity]{.underline}**. First is the issue of personal agency. If CBT
is able to motivate, enable, and even control human decision making and
action, where does individual responsibility end? Are soldiers
responsible for their actions when under the influence of advanced CBT,
and under what conditions? Relatedly, **[how does the Alliance ensure

It would, however, be erroneous to solely limit the analysis of
disagreements among NATO members to the actions of Turkey as the current
'problematic ally.' **[Even Western European Allies sometimes hold
positions that are incompatible with each other]{.underline}**. **[Key
disagreements pertain to threat perception and]{.underline}** hence
**[defense priorities]{.underline}** as well as to the likelihood of
continued US security guarantees. **[These disagreements]{.underline}**
run deep---sometimes so deep that they are not always visible at the
surface level of every-day policy issues. Yet, they **[clearly shape
positions]{.underline}**, as a closer look at the ongoing European
defense debate reveals. In past years, many important aspects of this
debate revolved around the notion of European strategic autonomy. Long
known and used in a French national context,14 the 2016 European Union
Global Strategy lifted "strategic autonomy" to the European level. The
document "nurtures the ambition of strategic autonomy for the European
Union," but does not provide a concise definition of the notion's
content or implication.15 The ensuing and There is No "Europe" 161 at
times heated debate among Europeans was not particularly enlightening at
the conceptual level and is today considered in need of being
"detoxified."16 Yet, the debate has offered many meta-level insights
into the various national approaches to European security and defense.
Two variables are key in this context: threat perception and assessments
of the likely future of US security guarantees for Europe. **[Threat
perception is an absolute classic in European defense debates: the
question of against what or whom Europe needs to be
defended]{.underline}**. **[Diverging threat perceptions translate into
different and even incompatible views on what policies the Alliance
should adopt regarding certain key issues]{.underline}**, notably in its
relationship with Russia as the single most important issue for
Euro-Atlantic security in the 21st century. Moreover, given that threat
perception requires translation into defense planning, **[this is also a
debate about allocating capabilities and defining priorities in light of
scarce resources]{.underline}**. Most important in the context of threat
perception is how Europeans should deal with Russia, notably in a wider
vision of Euro-Atlantic security. The second variable pertains to the
United States and its engagement in European security. Here, the key
question is that of the mid- and long-term reliability of US security
guarantees and the conclusions Europeans need to draw for their own
security cooperation, which, in turn, has ramifications for NATO.

Initial discussions on the next **[Strategic Concept]{.underline}**
**[revolved around the need to prepare the Alliance for]{.underline}** a
world characterised by **[the return of inter-state threats and great
power competition]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** alone **[marked
a sharp contrast with the Alliance's post-Cold War focus on
transnational challenges]{.underline}** and non-peer competitors.
**[What would the return of great power competition entail for the
evolving balance between NATO's]{.underline}** so-called **[three core
tasks]{.underline}** (i.e. collective defense, crisis management and
cooperative security)**[?]{.underline}** **[How should NATO
balance]{.underline}** **[a renewed focus on]{.underline}** inter-state
threats and **[great power competitors]{.underline}** **[with the
ongoing relevance of transnational threats]{.underline}** and
challenges, like terrorism or the climate-security nexus? When thinking
about great power competition, **[how much emphasis should NATO put on
Russia's immediate threat to Europe]{.underline}**, as opposed to the
more systemic challenge represented by China's strategic rise? **[And
what should be the right balance between the military and non-military
aspects of great power competition?]{.underline}** The latter question
becomes particularly relevant **[in light of]{.underline}** the growing
salience of "hybrid" forms of warfare and **[emerging disruptive
technologies]{.underline}**, **[which compel the Alliance to emphasize
societal resilience at home and step up its efforts to innovate
tech]{.underline}**nologically. **[The war in Ukraine]{.underline}** --
and ongoing debates about how the Alliance can assist Ukraine while
strengthening deterrence in Eastern Europe -- **[have become important
topics in Strategic Concept discussions]{.underline}**. In a way, the
current war vindicates the view that we do indeed live in an
increasingly competitive world, and that inter-state threats are back.
On the other hand, the overt and direct nature of Russia's invasion
challenges some of the pervading assumptions about how future conflict
was likely to unfold in indirect and hybrid ways. Even though the
Strategic Concept is meant to inform long-term strategy, **[the salience
of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}** and the fact that it is likely to
reverberate for years to come, **[makes the crisis important when
developing the Concept]{.underline}**. That said, uncertainty as to the
fate of Russia's operations in Ukraine or how they may impinge on
Russia's power and strategic posture along the Eastern border of the
Alliance, mean that any reflection on NATO's strategy in the East will
need to go beyond the Strategic Concept. More broadly,
**[the]{.underline}** Strategic **[Concept must look
beyond]{.underline}** immediate challenges in **[Europe and take stock
of the broader shift in global power]{.underline}** from the
Euro-Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific. The Strategic Concept from a
historical perspective The current NATO Strategic Concept, adopted in
Lisbon in 2010, aims to strike a balance between the Alliance's
so-called three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management and
cooperative security. In many ways, the Lisbon Strategic Concept draws
on the previous one (adopted in Washington in 1999). It represents a
crystallisation of NATO's experience in the post-Cold War period, an era
characterised by Western military-technological supremacy, and the
seeming absence of peer competitors. In the immediate post-Cold War
period, the belief that former adversaries like Russia and even emerging
great powers like China could somehow be integrated in the rules-based
order was still widely held. This was a truly exceptional period. The
power surplus enjoyed by the United States and its allies gave the West
a free hand (both politically and militarily) to engage in ambitious
out-of-area endeavours, and leverage crisis management operations and
collective security initiatives to expand the remit of the so-called
open and rules-based international order, not only in the broader
Euro-Atlantic neighbourhood but also beyond. During the long-post Cold
War era, collective defense and deterrence took a back seat. Even though
they constituted the fundamentals of Euro-Atlantic security, they were
considered almost superfluous in light of Western military-technological
supremacy. Crisis management and collective security ruled the day. But
this world is gone and great power competition is back. That reality was
illustrated by Russia's annexations of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and
Crimea in 2008 and 2014, and even more starkly by its invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. Also striking has been China's strategic rise
and growing assertiveness in East Asia and beyond. Peer competitors are
once again challenging security, and geopolitical and security
architecture in the important regions of Europe and East Asia, but also
the institutional and normative fabric that underpins the open,
rules-based international order. **[Adapting the Alliance
to]{.underline}** this **[new wave of great power
competition]{.underline}** **[is arguably the main
challenge]{.underline}** in the coming decade. Beyond Ukraine Since
NATO's birth in 1949 -- and potentially as far back as the industrial
revolution -- the Euro-Atlantic region has been the undisputable centre
of gravity of global politics. Developments in and around the
Euro-Atlantic region typically had a profound impact upon geopolitical
and strategic balances elsewhere. However, in today's and tomorrow's
worlds, the opposite is likely to be true. As the Indo-Pacific becomes
the center of gravity of global economic growth, military competition
and technological innovation, dynamics emanating from that region are
likely to have a growing impact on other regions, including the
Euro-Atlantic. Thus, the geopolitical and security architecture of the
Euro-Atlantic region is likely to be increasingly affected by exogenous
factors. In a world that no longer revolves around the Euro-Atlantic
region, and is increasingly defined by China's strategic rise and the
growing centrality of the Indo-Pacific region, the Alliance will need to
think more globally about security. To be sure, **[the Euro-Atlantic
region will remain NATO's direct referent]{.underline}**. However, the
future of that region -- and that of NATO itself -- will likely become
increasingly affected by broader geostrategic dynamics to a degree and
in ways that are unfamiliar to NATO and its member countries. NATO must
therefore adapt to a world in which the Euro-Atlantic region will remain
important, but will probably become a secondary theatre in world
politics, as well as in the context of US geostrategy. These changes
should push the Alliance to develop a more global approach to security.
Beyond the more specific question of whether NATO itself should act
globally (e.g., by developing a presence in the Indo-Pacific region),
the Allies ought to think more systematically about the main
communicating vessels between Euro-Atlantic security and broader
geostrategic dynamics, specifically the Indo-Pacific. Three stand out:
the global implications of China's rise; the evolution of the
Sino-Russian relationship; and America's need to prioritise between
Europe and Asia, and what that may mean for NATO, European security and
the longstanding debate about a transatlantic division of labour. The
war in Ukraine, and Allied efforts to assist Ukraine and to bolster
deterrence in the East, seem to have led to a revival of the
transatlantic relationship, and a renewed focus on Europe, including for
the United States. Yet contrary to what one may instinctively think, the
war in Ukraine is unlikely to alter the steady shift in the centre of
global strategy and politics -- or, for that matter, of US geostrategy
-- towards the Indo-Pacific region. Rather than halt a shift towards the
Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine crisis and the response to it so far, provide
a powerful illustration of how European geopolitical and security
dynamics are increasingly affected by extra-European ones. For one
thing, China- and Asia-centric considerations have featured prominently
in debates about how the United States should respond to Russia's
aggression in Europe. Some experts argue that the United States should
avoid getting bogged down in a European war -- lest this should distract
its attention from the Indo-Pacific. Others have contended that a strong
U.S. response will deter adversaries and reassure allies elsewhere,
notably in the Indo-Pacific. As long as the security of Europe and the
Indo-Pacific hinges largely on US power, and as long as these two
regions continue to exercise significant pressure on US defense
resources, their alliance and deterrence architectures will probably
remain intertwined. This underscores the importance of greater political
and military coordination between NATO and its key partners in the
Asia-Pacific, namely Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea and New
Zealand. For another thing, it is also important that NATO and its
Asia-Pacific partners have a common picture on Russia and China, and how
their relationship may evolve. Without ignoring existing frictions, if
the Sino-Russia relationship remains broadly cooperative, attempts to
drive a wedge between them may prove challenging. The broader point,
however, is that whatever the United States and its European and
Asia-Pacific allies think they can do in relation to engaging Russia or
China, or manipulating their relationship, they must remain aligned.
Otherwise, there is a risk they may draw different conclusions about
either power's trajectory or how their relationship may evolve, and thus
frame their policies on the basis of different premises. This could
conceivably trigger competition between the United States and its
allies, and among NATO Allies themselves. Conclusion The war in Ukraine
has become an important aspect in the debate about NATO's forthcoming
Strategic Concept. Discussions on how to continue to assist Ukraine and
bolster deterrence along the Eastern part of the Alliance will no doubt
take center stage in Madrid in June. This is understandable: deterring a
war in Europe is what NATO was created for. In fact, when it comes to
the main questions informing the debate on the Strategic Concept - i.e.
the balance between the three core tasks; state vs. non-state threats;
military vs. non-military; Russia vs. China, etc. - the war in Ukraine
may make the pendulum swing closer to the former than many would have
anticipated just prior to the invasion. However, **[preparing the
Alliance for a context increasingly defined by great power competition
requires looking beyond the current crisis in Eastern Europe, and taking
stock of broader geo-strategic developments]{.underline}**. This is
particularly important in light of the decreasing centrality of the
Euro-Atlantic region in global strategic competition, and the fact that
security dynamics in and around Europe will be progressively affected by
extra-European developments. Critically, **[the Alliance will need to
develop a more global approach to security, and more specifically a
better understanding of geo-strategic developments in the Indo-Pacific
region, and their likely implications for Euro-Atlantic
security.]{.underline}**

### Internals \-\-- Prioritize k Deterrence

**[The 2010 Strategic Concept displays all the signs of an Alliance
faced with a range of security challenges but no major
threats]{.underline}**. It was drafted and approved at a time when NATO
forces were heavily engaged in a war of choice in Afghanistan, and when
the vast majority of allies did not perceive Russia -- let alone China
-- as an adversary, but rather saw it as a potential strategic partner.
Certainly, some allies wanted NATO to 'come home' and focus its energies
on Europe, Russia and collective defence, but most
**[allies]{.underline}**, including the United States, **[preferred NATO
to be global in orientation and better prepared for crisis
management]{.underline}**. Thus, **[there was little consensus as to
what NATO's key strategic focus should be in an indeterminate security
environment]{.underline}**.7 **[Unsurprisingly]{.underline}**, **[the
Strategic Concept does not set any clear strategic
priorities]{.underline}**. **[It merely identifies three core
tasks]{.underline}**: collective defence, crisis management and
cooperative security. **[Collective defence is catalogued first, but
there are no indications that the order in which the tasks are listed is
meant to signify a hierarchy of priorities. Several new initiatives and
forward-looking schemes are introduced, yet the concept stops short of
giving precedence to any core task.]{.underline}** Likewise, **[the
potential threats, risks and challenges identified by the concept, most
of which are unconventional and transnational in nature, appear to be
listed in no particular order.]{.underline}** Tellingly, **[the concept
describes the security environment as being characterised by 'a broad
and evolving set of challenges' that include the proliferation of
nuclear weapons, technology-related trends and environmental
constraints]{.underline}**.8 **[The 2010 concept's ambiguity concerning
threats and strategic priorities predictably spills over into its (lack
of) military guidance]{.underline}**. Unlike the 1991 and 1999 Strategic
Concepts, **[the 2010 version does not include a detailed section on
'Guidelines for Defence' that lays out comprehensive directions for
military planners. I]{.underline}**t speaks in generic terms of new
defence initiatives and lists aspirations to develop future
capabilities, yet **[it is silent on concrete measures, desired military
effects and objectives]{.underline}**. Compared with its forerunners,
and particularly the Cold War concepts, the 2010 document is thus
extraordinarily political in character and oriented towards public
diplomacy, and by implication rather disconnected from the military side
of NATO. Any bridge linking the Alliance's political masters to its
military authorities, as previously established by the 'Guidelines for
Defence' in 1991 and 1999, is awkwardly missing.

//um-ef)

**[NATO has embarked on]{.underline}** the process of producing a
revised Strategic **[Concept,]{.underline}** which will be **[presented
at]{.underline}** the forthcoming **[2022]{.underline}** summit in
Madrid. As part of this process a **[vigorous debate is taking place
over its role as a security provider]{.underline}**. As China grows in
prominence on the organisation's strategic agenda, an underlying
question is that of the type of presence or power projection the
alliance is willing to commit to in the Indo-Pacific area. A shift
towards greater involvement in this area would likely meet with US
approval. On NATO's southern border, many remain preoccupied with risks
stemming from the Middle East and North Africa region -- terrorism,
instability and migration -- while new conventional and hybrid
challenges are arising from geopolitical rivals that include Russia,
Iran and, increasingly, China. Russia, with its enduring assertiveness
in terms of both rhetoric and action, remains a considerable threat to
Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, and others, as the latest troop
manoeuvres on its border with Ukraine and growing hold over Belarus
illustrate. **[The problem]{.underline}**, of course,
**[is]{.underline}** that such **[challenges are hard to reconcile,
given competing risk perceptions]{.underline}**, and even more so **[to
synthesise into a single strategic narrative.]{.underline}**
Historically, this is perhaps unsurprising. **[For most of its existence
NATO's essential raison d'être was firmly anchored in its core Article 5
task]{.underline}** of ensuring collective defence.5 It was only after
the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the organisation began a
historic process of strategic reorientation away from the territorial
defence of European states toward a broader range of security concerns
and responsibilities. In the latter end of the 1990s this paved the way
for a series of decisive NATO-led military interventions in the civil
wars of the former Yugoslavia which, together with the advent of the
Responsibility to Protect (R2P), produced a great deal of optimism
regarding the ability and perceived duty of foreign powers to defend
populations against state-perpetrated atrocities in other parts of the
world. But as the early optimism of the 1990s turned into the excesses
of the so-called "War on Terror" and 2003 invasion of Iraq, this
enthusiasm began to falter. With the alliance's difficult experiences in
Libya and Afghanistan came an enduring perception of mission fatigue and
a sense of NATO's own limitations as a military organisation supporting
crisis management. While **[Afghanistan]{.underline}** helped to erode
allied willingness to engage in future comparably ambitious
stabilisation efforts abroad, events in Libya accelerated underlying
trends by elevating questions over whether NATO was suited to act as a
primary enforcer of R2P. This **[produced enduring scepticism regarding
the general desirability and efficacy of NATO's engagements
abroad]{.underline}**, which culminated in 2014 with the end of the
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and the
transition to a "train-and-advise" mission that withdrew in September
2021.

**[NATO achieves its objectives by upscaling its readiness, response and
military capabilities to deter an adversary]{.underline}**. It aims at
maintaining military forces in the right place and time capable of
deterring or, if necessary, repelling an adversary. In this context,
**[NATO leaders, who are aware of the fact that unity is essential for
success, comply with the principles of "cohesion" and "coherence".
Hence, "cohesion" and "coherence" have become distinctive indicators of
NATO's current strategic concept]{.underline}**. According to the former
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, "**[the Alliance that
cannot ensure collective defence loses cohesion in achieving collective
security".]{.underline}** In order to clarify the principles that are
crucial for the implementation of the new strategy, it is necessary to
understand what "NATO's cohesion" and "NATO's coherence" mean.Footnote1
**[NATO's cohesion means a level of political and ideological unity as
well as solidarity between the members of the Pact]{.underline}**. It
mainly refers to the principles on which the Alliance is based. This is
**[particularly true of the Member States' commitment to collective
defence, threats and challenges facing the Alliance.]{.underline}**
**[NATO's coherence refers to consensus among the Member States in order
to guarantee the Alliance's capabilities and capacities necessary to
ensure the effective implementation of NATO's missions. It involves
strategic plans]{.underline}**, **[resource requirements, material
capabilities, operational procedures, command structures, the number of
soldiers and logistical infrastructure]{.underline}** (Hodges et al.
2019). The dynamics of events after 2014 as well as the emergence of new
international threats (e.g. ISIS, refugees, epidemics) has led to
increasing expenditures on security and collective defence (Grygiel and
Wess Mitchell 2014). This issue seems to be extremely important and
therefore still remains within the realm of discussions among the
politicians and bodies responsible for the state security. With time and
transformations in geopolitical and military situations in the world,
the requirements for the North Atlantic Pact have also changed, which
has inspired the authors to write this article.

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

**[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was under way, the "fog of war" and]{.mark}
rising [unpredictability would inevitably set]{.mark} in, complicating
the implementation of any]{.underline}** predetermined theories of
escalation, deescalation and inter-**[conflict management. The actual
dynamics of]{.underline}** a **[conflict]{.underline}** and the
perceptions of the stakes involved **[are extremely difficult to
predict. Simulations]{.underline}** and table-top exercises can
**[give]{.underline}** only **[limited insights]{.underline}** into the
actual decision-making processes and interactions.

Still, **[[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} managed and
[controlled]{.mark} in a way that would bring it to a swift end
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian theory]{.mark} of
victory]{.underline}** would **[seek to [exploit weak points in]{.mark}
an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the conviction that
democracies are weak and]{.underline}** their leaders and populations
are **[risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may [assume]{.mark}
that]{.underline}** its **[[threats of]{.mark} horizontal or vertical
[escalation could be]{.mark}]{.underline}** particularly **[[effective.
It would]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[try to bring home the
notion]{.underline}** that **[it has much higher stakes in the
conflict]{.underline}** (regime survival) **[than]{.underline}** a
majority of the **[NATO members]{.underline}** involved,
**[and]{.underline}** thus **[will be ready to [push]{.mark} the
[boundaries]{.mark} of]{.underline}** the **[conflict further. It
would]{.underline}** most likely **[[try to]{.mark} test and
[exploit]{.mark} potential [divisions]{.mark} within the Alliance,
combining selective diplomacy and activation of its intelligence assets
in]{.underline}** some **[NATO states]{.underline}** with a degree of
selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

**[[Any]{.mark} NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} inevitably [have a
nuc]{.mark}lear [dimension]{.mark}. The role of nuclear weapons as a
tool [for escalation control]{.mark} for Russia has been]{.underline}**
thoroughly **[debated by experts, but when]{.underline}** and how
**[Russia might use]{.underline}** (and not merely showcase or activate)
**[nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an open question.
Beyond]{.underline}** catch phrases such as **["escalate to
de-escalate"]{.underline}** or "escalate to win" **[[there are a]{.mark}
wider [range of options for Russian]{.mark} nuclear weapon
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[[a single nuclear]{.mark}
warning [shot could be lethal]{.mark} or non-lethal. It could be
directed against a]{.underline}** purely **[military target or
a]{.underline}** military-**[civilian one. [Detonation could be]{.mark}
configured for an [EMP effect. A "false flag"]{.mark} attack
is]{.underline}** also **[conceivable. These options]{.underline}**
might be used to **[signal escalation and could significantly
[complicate]{.mark} NATO's [responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. **[It is
less clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the
conflict]{.underline}** to achieve these goals, **[and what
mechanisms]{.underline}** and means **[it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline}** some degree of **[control]{.underline}** over
the conflict.

**[The goals]{.underline}** and methods **[of waging a [conflict]{.mark}
with Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline}** probably **[[have to be
limited]{.mark} in order [to avoid]{.mark} a massive [nuclear
exchang]{.mark}e. Such limitations]{.underline}** would also involve
restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian territory. But
too narrow an approach **[could put too much restraint on NATO's
operations: the Russian regime's stability may]{.underline}** ultimately
**[need to be threatened]{.underline}** in order **[to force the
leadership into terminating the conflict]{.underline}**. NATO would thus
need to establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian
actions would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks
against military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be
useful as tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover,
individual NATO Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's
actions, might pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

**[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of [escalation
control]{.mark}]{.underline}** and on lessons **[from the Cold
War]{.underline}** confrontation **[[might be misleading]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [Russia-NATO conflict would]{.mark} play out
would [be]{.mark} radically different from the 20th
century]{.underline}** screenplay. Moreover, **[instead of
gradual]{.underline}** (linear) **[escalation or salami tactics
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline}** surprizing
**[["leap frog" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, possibly
**[connected]{.underline}** with actions **[in different
domains]{.underline}** (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

**[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline}** most likely **[not survive the first hours
of]{.underline}** an **[actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable
of [underestimat]{.mark}ing the [resolve]{.mark} of the other side to
prevail]{.underline}** in a conflict **[and the other side's willingness
to]{.underline}** commit the necessary resources and **[endure the
costs, especially once both]{.underline}** sides **[start
committing]{.underline}** their **[political capital]{.underline}** and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

**[The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including
the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Russia's ongoing war of naked aggression against
Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering
questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which
threat should be the focus of NATO's upcoming strategic
concept.]{.underline}** The answer is clear: **[The U.S. must lead the
Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization's raison d'être
of collective defense]{.underline}**. While the Alliance faces
challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism
originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that **[Russia
continues to be the only existential threat to member
states.]{.underline}** **[NATO must send a strong signal that it is
strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the
increased threat from Russia. Deterrence measures should include an
Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and
continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated
Alliance operational planning in light of Russia's position in Belarus
and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in
the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO
treaty's Article 5.]{.underline}** These deterrence measures must be
carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective,
China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect
hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be
to the detriment of the nation's ability to counter China. The
Importance of NATO Deterrence Has Only Increased **[From the Arctic to
the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and
the interests of its members]{.underline}**. For member states in
Eastern Europe, **[Russia represents a real and potentially existential
threat.]{.underline}** **[Russia's]{.underline}** entrenched position in
Belarus, along with its **[ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation
that borders four NATO]{.underline}** members, in two, **[scramble the
geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational
planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and
resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern
flank.]{.underline}** Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine will
hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their
commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an
intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its
member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a
significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for
NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties
have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.
Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty---an attack on one is an attack on all---Article 3 is the most
important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3
states that member states, at a minimum, will "maintain and develop
their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack." Only a
handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to
their Article 3 commitment. In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense
investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales
Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on
defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on
"major equipment" purchases by 2024. **[NATO allies have made real and
sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far
from enough]{.underline}**. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2
percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.1

but it **[does not have global escalation dominance vis-à-vis NATO.
Russia shares borders not only with NATO members to its west but also

apparatus to address multiple threats both within and outside its

balance of power that will become even more unfavorable as time goes
by.]{.underline}** **[Russia is outmatched by the United

China. **[Because of U.S. military capabilities, NATO is in a more
advantageous situation. Total NATO defense expenditures exceed those of
Russia by a factor of 10.]{.underline}** Even if we exclude U.S. defense
expenditures, European NATO members still spend more than twice as much
on their militaries than Russia. Of course, European allies vary in
their operational readiness and willingness to fight Russia. However,
**[because the United States has a significant nuclear weapons arsenal,

Unfortunately, **[the world seems to have]{.underline}**
**[forgotten]{.underline}** **[the importance of]{.underline}**
**[standing up to a bully]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Remember that **[MAD]{.underline}**
**[was about the balance of terror]{.underline}**: lose the balance and
all that remains is terror. Today, **[NATO]{.underline}** **[must
balance]{.underline}** **[Russian threats to use nukes with
a]{.underline}** **[commitment]{.underline}** **[to retaliate in
kind]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[meet Putin's
escalation]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** **[escalation of its
own]{.underline}**. **[In a MAD world]{.underline}**, **[caving in to
nuclear intimidation is a]{.underline}** **[sign of
weakness]{.underline}** **[that makes a war]{.underline}** **[more
likely]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[in case of any aggression]{.underline}**, **[the
response]{.underline}** **[must be total war]{.underline}**. The paradox
of Narva helps in understanding the calculus. Suppose that the Russian
army captured Narva, a small Estonian city bordering Russia. If NATO did
not respond to this attack on a member state, the Alliance would be
dead, and all countries without nuclear weapons, lacking a credible
deterrent against a nuclear strike, would be obvious targets of future
aggression.

**[A limited NATO response would mean that the aggressor
could]{.underline}** **[keep pushing boundaries]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[raising its demands]{.underline}**, just as
Hitler raised his demands in the name of peace. **[One
must]{.underline}** therefore **[conclude that the answer is to
go]{.underline}** "**[all in]{.underline}**," **[no matter how small
Russia's aggression is]{.underline}**. **[This also means that
NATO]{.underline}** **[must avoid]{.underline}** **[describing what it
will]{.underline}** **[not do in response to aggression]{.underline}**.
Instead, **[the Alliance must]{.underline}** **[credibly
signal]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[all options are on the
table]{.underline}**.

**[The prospect of a nuclear war is terrifying]{.underline}**. **[But it
is]{.underline}** equally if not **[more terrifying]{.underline}** **[to
think that a madman in the Kremlin]{.underline}** with nuclear weapons
**[can]{.underline}** **[beat into submission]{.underline}** **[whole
countries]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}**
**[continents]{.underline}** **[by threatening to launch his arsenal
against]{.underline}** **[anybody]{.underline}** **[who meddles with his
ambitions]{.underline}**.

Today, **[when Ukraine is the target]{.underline}** **[of Putin's
delusional ambitions]{.underline}**, **[some]{.underline}** US
**[policymakers may ask why NATO should risk a nuclear confrontation
over a country that is not a member]{.underline}**. **[Putin
may]{.underline}** **[then threaten]{.underline}**
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
**[members]{.underline}** Finland or Sweden. But, again, the argument
goes, they are not in NATO, so why risk Armageddon? **[The day after
tomorrow]{.underline}**, **[the target may be Poland or
Germany]{.underline}** -- but at least they are not America.

**[W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar **[II]{.underline}** **[is
a grim reminder that]{.underline}** "**[a quarrel in a faraway
country]{.underline}**, between people about whom we know nothing," as
Neville Chamberlain infamously described the Sudeten crisis,
**[can]{.underline}** **[quickly escalate]{.underline}** **[into
a]{.underline}** **[global conflagration]{.underline}**. But **[such
dangerous progressions are]{.underline}** **[not
inevitable]{.underline}**.

**[If Ukraine has the courage to]{.underline}** **[battle Russian
aggression]{.underline}** **[under the most difficult
conditions]{.underline}**, **[the West]{.underline}**
**[must]{.underline}** **[find the nerve to stand up to Putin's nuclear
blackmail in order to preserve the wider peace]{.underline}**. **[Russia
has shown that it is ready to]{.underline}** **[murder innocent
Ukrainians]{.underline}**, **[but it is]{.underline}** **[not ready to
commit suicide]{.underline}**. **[And]{.underline}**
**[that]{.underline}** **[holds the key to preventing more unspeakable

Seventy years after NATO's birth, **[[the Alliance is still confronting
an existential threat]{.mark} to its east]{.underline}**, several
defense and foreign affairs ministers said on December 3. Although
French President Emmanuel Macron has made waves by suggesting that
terrorism, not Russia, was the biggest threat facing NATO today, **[the
defense ministers from [Estonia and Lithuania]{.mark} were clear that
they still [see Moscow as their biggest]{.mark} challenge. "Russia has
shown with its actions that it is a serious [security
threat]{.mark},"]{.underline}** Estonian defense minister Jüri Luik said
during a panel discussion on Baltic and Black sea security during the
NATO engages event in London on December 3. "For Lithuania, \[Russia\]
is the only external existential threat we have," added Lithuanian
defense minister Raimundas Karoblis. While Macron has a legitimate
concern in preventing terrorism in Europe, Luik argued that unlike
terrorism, **["[Russia is the existential threat"]{.mark} because "it is
a nation state." [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he added, **[[is "the
only organization that can viably" deter Russian aggression against its
neighbors]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Both ministers praised NATO's efforts
to protect the Baltic states from Russian attack and show Moscow that
the Alliance would not leave them undefended. "Lithuania has never had
such a great number of guarantees and allies as we have now," Karoblis
said. Luik warned, however, that persistence is key to staving off
Russian aggression. "**[[If we are serious in our actions]{.mark}, if we
are clear and [concise in our messaging, then the threat is quite
low]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he explained. "**[But [if we are weak, if
we are wobbly, then the threat can go up]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Both
Karoblis and Luik suggested that NATO needs to do more to shore up its
Baltic defense, including larger exercises to show "how we bring in
additional troops if they are necessary," as Luik suggested. Karoblis
highlighted the need for "more precise defense planning," a wish that
has become controversial after a reported Turkish attempt to block new
military plans for the Baltics and Poland until NATO recognizes Syrian
Kurdish groups as terrorist organizations. Despite the supposed Turkish
opposition, neither Luik nor Karoblis were concerned that the proposed
plans would be blocked more than temporarily. "The discussions are going
on all the time," Luik explained, adding that "if we don't find a
compromise here, we hopefully will find it a bit later. But I am
absolutely sure we will find a compromise." Karoblis promised "we will
find a solution to this." Black Sea instability But **[while [the
Baltics may remain firmly in NATO's sights]{.mark}, Romania's defense
minister Nicolae Ciuca warned [that the Black Sea region,]{.mark} the
other vital part of the Alliance's eastern flank, [needs to be accounted
for]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}** "NATO and the EU need to have a very
coherent approach to the whole flank," rather than just tailoring
solutions to either the Baltics or the Black Sea, he argued. In the
latter especially, he continued, "we need to focus on strengthening the
NATO and EU presence and NATO and EU cooperation in order to support the
partnership countries," such as Georgia and Ukraine, who have both faced
invasion by Moscow in the last decade. "Whether you like it or not, we
defend your eastern flank," Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko
told the crowd in London, warning that the growing number of priorities
for NATO in the Baltics and the Southern flank are causing the region to
"believe that we are being left alone" despite being under daily
pressure from Moscow. Georgian foreign minister David Zalkaliani agreed
that the region must be one of importance for NATO because ["**[without
a secure Black Sea, there will be no security in the Euro Atlantic
security space.]{.underline}**"]{.mark} Zalkaliani particularly lamented
the failure of NATO leaders to approve the accession of either Ukraine
or Georgia to NATO despite pledging to do so at the 2008 NATO Summit.
Despite the prolonged wait, "Georgia is already acting like an ally,"
Zalkaliani explained, as his country has met the 2 percent of GDP
defense spending goal and has contributed troops to NATO missions in
Afghanistan and Europe. "When a country like Georgia delivers it has to
be reciprocated," he argued. Prystaiko agreed, noting that the
"indecisiveness" of NATO since the 2008 promise has given Moscow the
greenlight to attack both countries. **[Russian President Vladimir
[Putin,]{.mark} Prystaiko argued, [can only be deterred through the
strength of NATO. "He still appreciates and respects the mightiness of
the Alliance. That is actually the only language which Putin
understands."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Breaking NATO causes Russian aggression that escalates to nuclear war

**Beauchamp 18** \[Zack, senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers
global politics and ideology, "How Trump is killing America's
alliances,"
6/12/18, <https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17448866/trump-south-korea-alliance-trudeau-g7>\] 

How **[the weakening of American alliances could lead to a massive
war. ]{.underline}**There has never, in human history, been an era as
peaceful as our own. This is a hard truth to appreciate, given the
horrible violence ongoing in places like Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar, yet
the evidence is quite clear. Take a look at this chart from the
University of Oxford's Max Roser. It tracks the number of years in a
given time period in which "great powers" --- meaning the militarily and
economically powerful countries at that time --- were at war with each
other over the course of the past 500 years. The decline is
unmistakable: \[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\] This data should give you some
appreciation for how unique, and potentially precarious, our historical
moment is. For more than 200 years, from 1500 to about 1750, major
European powers like Britain and France and Spain were warring
constantly. The frequency of conflict declined in the 19th and 20th
centuries, but the wars that did break out --- the Napoleonic conflicts,
both world wars --- were particularly devastating. The past 70 years
without great power war, a period scholars term "the Long Peace," is one
of history's most wonderful anomalies. The question then becomes: Why
did it happen? And could Trump mucking around with a pillar of the
global order, American alliances, put it in jeopardy? The answer to the
second question, ominously, appears to be yes. **[[There is significant
evidence that]{.mark} strong American alliances --- most notably the
NATO alliance and US agreements to defend Japan and South Korea ---
[have been instrumental in putting an end to great power war]{.mark}.
"[As this alliance system spreads and expands, it correlates with
t]{.mark}his dramatic decline, this unprecedented [drop, in
warfare]{.mark},"]{.underline}** says Michael Beckley, a professor of
international relations at Tufts University. "**[[It's a really, really
strong correlation."]{.mark} ]{.underline}**A 2010 study by Rice's Leeds
and the University of Kentucky's Jesse C. Johnson surveyed a large data
set on alliances between 1816 and 2000. They found that countries in
defensive alliances were 20 percent less likely to be involved in a
conflict, on average, than countries that weren't. **[[This holds true
even after you control for other factors that would affect the
likelihood of war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like whether a country is a
democracy or whether it has an ongoing dispute with a powerful neighbor.
In a follow-up paper, Leeds and Johnson looked at the same data set to
see whether certain kinds of alliances were more effective at protecting
its members than others. Their conclusion is that alliances deter war
best when their members are militarily powerful and when enemies take
seriously the allies' promise to fight together in the event of an
attack. The core US alliances --- NATO, Japan, and South Korea --- fit
these descriptors neatly. A third study finds evidence that alliances
allow allies to restrain each other from going to war. Let's say Canada
wants to get involved in a conflict somewhere. Typically, it would
discuss its plans with the United States first --- and if America thinks
it's a bad idea, Canada might well listen to them. There's strong
statistical evidence that countries don't even try to start some
conflicts out of fear that an ally would disapprove. These three
findings all suggest that **[NATO and America's East Asian alliances
very likely are playing a major role in preserving the Long
Peace]{.underline}** --- which is why Trump's habit of messing around
with alliances is so dangerous. According to many Russia experts,
Vladimir **[Putin's deepest geostrategic goal is "breaking"
NATO.]{.underline}** The member states where anyone would expect him to
test NATO's commitment would be the Baltics --- Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania --- small former Soviet republics that recently became NATO
members. We can't predict if and when a rival like Putin would conclude
that America's alliances seemed weak enough to try testing them.
Hopefully, it never happens. But the more Trump attacks the foundations
of America's allies, the more likely things are to change. **[[The
absolute risk of a Russian invasion of a NATO
state]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a North Korean attack on the South is
relatively low, but the consequences **[[are so potentially catastrophic
--- nuclear war! ---]{.mark} that it's worth taking anything that
increases the odds of such a conflict seriously.]{.underline}** The
crack-up of the West? The world order is a little like a game of Jenga.
In the game, there are lots of small blocks that interlock to form a
stable tower. Each player has to remove a block without toppling the
tower. But each time you take out a block, the whole thing gets a bit
less stable. Take out enough blocks and it will collapse. The
international order works in kind of the same way. There are lots of
different interlocking parts --- the spread of democracy, American
alliances, nuclear deterrence, and the like --- that work together to
keep the global peace. But take out one block and the other ones might
not be strong enough to keep things together on their own. At the end of
the Cold War, British and French leaders worried that the passing of the
old order might prove destabilizing. In a January 1990 meeting, French
President François Mitterrand told British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that he feared a united Germany could seize control of even
more territory than Hitler. Some experts feared that in the absence of
the external Soviet threat, Western European powers might go back to
waging war with each other. Thankfully, those predictions turned out to
be wrong. There are multiple reasons for that, but one big one --- one
that also helped keep relations between other historical enemies, like
South Korea and Japan, peaceful --- is a shared participation in US
alliance networks. The US serves as the ultimate security blanket,
preventing these countries from having to build up their own armaments
and thus risk a replay of World War I. But **[[if American alliance
commitments become and remain less credible]{.mark}, it's possible this
order could crack up. ]{.underline}**America's partners aren't stupid.
They understand that Trump is the product of deep forces in American
politics, and that his victory might not be a one-off. If they think
that this won't be the last "America First" president in modern history,
depending on America the way that they have in the past could quickly
become a nightmare. **[The worst-case scenarios for a collapse in the US
alliance system are terrible. [Imagine full Japanese and German
rearmament]{.mark}, alongside [rapid-fire prolif]{.mark}eration [of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}. Imagine a crack-up of NATO, with
[European powers at loggerheads while Russia gobbles up the Baltic
states and the rest of Ukraine.]{.mark} Imagine [So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea's historical [tensions with Japan reigniting]{.mark}, and
a war between those two countries]{.underline}** or any combination of
them and China. All of this seems impossible to imagine now, almost
absurd. And indeed, in the short run, it is. There is no risk --- zero
--- of American allies turning on each other in the foreseeable future.
And it's possible that the next president after Trump could reassure
American allies that nothing like this could ever happen again. But the
truth is that there's just no way to know. **[When a fundamental force
for world peace starts to weaken, no one can really be sure how well the
system will hold up. Nothing like this --- the leader of the world's
hegemon rounding on its most important allies --- has ever happened
before]{.underline}**. What Donald Trump's presidency has done, in
effect, is start up another geopolitical Jenga game. Slowly but surely,
he's removing the blocks that undergird global security. It's possible
the global order survives Trump --- but it's just too early for us to
say for sure. **[Given the stakes, it's a game we'd rather not
play.]{.underline}**

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, **[NATO continues to
be of vital importance]{.underline}** **[to American
security]{.underline}** interests in five principal ways. First,
**[[NATO]{.mark} is at the [core]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of]{.mark}
one of the most significant foreign policy
accomplishments]{.underline}** **[in American
history]{.underline}**---**[the creation of a long-term [peace in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}** following the close of the Second World
War. **[Because of NATO]{.underline}** and the emergence of the European
Union, **[Europe is [united]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[after centuries
of]{.mark} division and [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[NATO's military
strength has been a [major reason]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[for]{.mark}
the [absence of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the Soviet Union and
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council
study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on defense
during the First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World War and
13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to those
levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have enjoyed
for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that peace. And
due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy. Second,
**[NATO delivers]{.underline}** additional **[benefits to]{.underline}**
U.S. **[military objectives and operations]{.underline}** beyond our
shores. **[NATO is at the [heart of]{.mark} our
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of North America]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[Europe]{.underline}** **[from [nuclear and
conventional]{.mark} threats]{.underline}**. British and French nuclear
weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North Atlantic area.
Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed that **[the best
way]{.underline}** **[to defend our country is through American forces
forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies]{.underline}**. **[This
strategy remains right for today given Russia's invasion of
Georgia]{.underline}** in 2008, **[of Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014 **[and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}**. **[NATO remains our
[primary vehicle for deterring Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Eastern
Europe. The **[NATO allies host a great number of [critical
bases]{.mark} for U.S. forces]{.underline}**---Ramstein in Germany,
Aviano in Italy, Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in
Turkey---**[that serve as a platform]{.underline}** **[for our presence
in Europe, as well as for U.S. [force projection against terrorist
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in North Africa and the Middle East and
for]{.underline}** our **[continued military operations in
Afghanistan]{.underline}**. **[Europe is a [critical]{.mark}
link]{.underline}** **[[in]{.mark} the development of our Ballistic
[Missile Defense]{.mark} network]{.underline}** focused on the Middle
East with Turkey, Romania, Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands,
Denmark, the UK and other allies all hosting elements of this system.
**[NATO allies]{.underline}** continue to **[participate in the U.S.-led
[coalition against]{.mark} the [I]{.mark}slamic
[S]{.mark}tate]{.underline}** in the Middle East. **[Many of the allies
play [lead roles]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
other **[[counter terror]{.mark} operations]{.underline}** **[such as
French forces in Mali]{.underline}** supported by the U.S. In
Afghanistan, the **[NATO allies remain with us in combat operations and
in training the Afghan military]{.underline}**. Over 1000 soldiers from
European and other partner nations have died there during the last
seventeen years. **[NATO continues to maintain the hard-earned peace in
Kosovo]{.underline}** **[with European troops bearing the large share of
the burden]{.underline}**. An EU-led force has taken on all of the
peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other
activities. Third, **[the NATO allies are among our closest and most
supportive global partners as we [confront]{.mark} the great
[transnational challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** that define this
century---**[the fight against [terrorism]{.mark}, the entire complex of
[cyber]{.mark} threats, [climate change]{.mark}, the risk of
[pandemics]{.mark}, mass [migration]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and
others]{.underline}**. The **[NATO allies]{.underline}** and our
partners in the European Union **[act together]{.underline}** with us on
these and other issues. **[This is of [incalculable
benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to the U.S]{.underline}**. **[Neither
Russia nor China have treaty allies]{.underline}**. **[NATO is a
significant advantage]{.underline}** **[for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[when it acts as a [force multiplier for
American interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[We are now in a new era of sustained confrontation with Russia. It is
not a broad-based competition for influence across numerous
domains]{.underline}** (e.g. economic), as is the case with China;
rather**[, it is a dynamic confrontation throughout the transatlantic
theater, most heatedly along NATO's eastern flank from the Arctic in the
north to the Black and Mediterranean Seas in the south. Russia wishes to
push its influence or direct control of territory as far west, north,
and south as possible, especially in the former Soviet states. Russia
has now demonstrated both the intent and capability to mass forces to
underwrite a sustained coercive-diplomacy campaign and invade the
sovereign territory of another nation]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[now
that Russian forces have undertaken operations in Ukraine, Putin may
decide to further threaten the territory and freedom of action of
additional non-NATO members, such as Georgia, Moldova, and
Finland]{.underline}**---**[as well as NATO members
themselves]{.underline}**. **[Russia today has a preponderance of
conventional combat forces in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}** No matter
what happens next regarding Russian military operations in Ukraine and
Belarus, **[the security environment in Europe and adjoining regions has
been structurally changed for the worse]{.underline}** for the short to
medium term. Thus, **[NATO's approach of deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}**---conducted by rapid reinforcement to its
frontline allies---**[can no longer be NATO's sole model for deterrence.
Deterrence by denial must now gain greater weight in NATO's strategic
concept.]{.underline}** Based on Russian actions, the 1997 NATO-Russia
Founding Act---and its restrictions on NATO's eastern posture---is no
longer relevant. **[We are in new, dangerous territory---a period of
sustained tensions, military moves and countermoves, and major
intermittent military crises in the Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}**
that will ebb and flow for at least the remainder of the 2020s, if not
longer. In this environment, **[military tensions will likely be
exacerbated by increased, aggressive Russian]{.underline}**
unconventional **[activities in the homelands of NATO]{.underline}** and
European Union (EU) members. We should expect Russia, feeling the impact
of coordinated Western sanctions and other diplomatic measures, will
ramp up the level and intensity of cyberattacks, election meddling,
online disinformation, covert activities, and support for extremists in
homelands across the democratic world. On top of a local
conventional-combat power imbalance between Russian and allied forces in
Eastern Europe, and increasingly aggressive sub-threshold operations,
**[the Alliance]{.underline}** also **[faces a highly dynamic
strategic-forces balance]{.underline}**. **[Russia has undertaken a
long-term, sustained nuclear-modernization program that has produced
several new types of offensive nuclear weapons. These novel systems
present new threats to NATO, its outmoded conceptual approach to nuclear
deterrence, and its aging nuclear force inventories.]{.underline}** In
turn, **[the Alliance will need to assure its nuclear deterrent
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Modernized and adapted NATO nuclear
capabilities must be prioritized in order for the Alliance to
effectively deter numerically superior Russian forces from attacking
NATO's eastern-flank members]{.underline}**, **[from
Norway]{.underline}** in the north **[through Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Turkey]{.underline}** in the
south. While **[this conclusion]{.underline}** may run counter to the
Biden administration's initial proposition to reduce US reliance on
nuclear weapons in its national security strategy**[, it would represent
a clear-eyed reappraisal of the new security environment.]{.underline}**
That Biden administration commitment was made well before the ongoing
Russian invasion of Ukraine. If President Biden were to wisely decide to
reassess this policy position, he would likely gain bipartisan and
Alliance-wide backing.

American strategists anxious to prioritize China as the "pacing
challenge" for U.S. defense strategy may object to any increase in the
resources devoted to European security. That would be a mistake.
**[Ensuring that Russia does not further destabilize Europe will have to
be]{.underline}** just as high **[a priority in the years to
come]{.underline}** as the China threat. That is because **[any
scenarios that could involve [hostile threats to NATO territory]{.mark}
could raise terrifying questions about possible escalation, even
eventually to the use of nuclear weapons, and could have existential
implications.]{.underline}** Moreover, despite the ongoing emphasis on
Asia as the most dynamic region on Earth, **[Europe remains the region
where America's preponderance of democratic, advanced, prosperous allies
is found --- and also the region where the world wars originated in
earlier eras]{.underline}**. Its strategic significance should never be
doubted. What is more, Europe's role in addressing the rise of China
will be central to any successful effort. Finally**[, to the extent
China is seen as a major challenge, it is all the more reason that
European security must be stabilized as an anchor of the future global
order]{.underline}**. **[The United States and allies do not have the
military, economic, or diplomatic bandwidth to address escalating
crises]{.underline}** and conflict in both Europe and Asia at the same
time. New crises and conflicts in Europe must be prevented before they
begin, to the maximum extent possible. I argue here that **[NATO should
shift from what has been, in effect, a tripwire defense of the Baltic
states and Poland since 2017 to a modest forward defense
posture]{.underline}**. Russian President **[Vladimir Putin must know of
NATO's unambiguous commitment to defend alliance territory and feel no
doubt that the United States and its allies would do whatever it took to
prevail in a war that he might initiate against one or more of the
alliance's members. The United States and allies should build facilities
and position forces with the intent of making this forward defense
enduring. The United States and allies should build facilities and
position forces with the intent of making this forward defense
enduring]{.underline}**. The concept of rotational deployments is no
longer appropriate given the scale of what is now needed, together with
the severity and hostility of the Russian actions that have made such
changes necessary. NATO should not adhere to its previous policy, dating
to the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, that ruled out permanent
stationing of allied combat forces on the territories of new members.
Those days are gone. Russia, with its attack on Ukraine, has now
violated the foundational principle of that Act --- the peaceful
resolution of disputes. Nor is rotational presence less expensive than
permanent basing. Indeed, by placing upward pressure on the size of the
U.S. force posture, it risks being much more expensive, given the large
number of units it inevitably entails. Thus, **[what has been termed
NATO's enhanced forward presence (eFP) will need to beef
up]{.underline}**. Rather than have small and disparate combat
formations from many countries, **[NATO should establish enough combat
punch in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that it could credibly fight to
protect these countries' territories in a future war against Russia,
while awaiting reinforcement from points further west]{.underline}**.
**[As the alliance's military and strategic backbone, U.S. military
formations must be an integral part of that NATO mix, to make the
alliance's commitment to successful defense and military victory
absolutely unambiguous]{.underline}**. That is the most promising way to
make deterrence robust, given what we now know about Putin and his
romanticized, twisted, dangerous vision of a greater Russia. The force
packages need not be particularly large, but they should be combat
capable, positioned in forward locations, and set up for the long term,
given the likelihood that Putin or a similar successor will remain on
the scene for many years.

### AT: China thumps Russia deterrence

#### China doesn't thump Russia deterrence -- the strategic concept will just mention it but focus on Russia.

However, Gupta said **[the summits would not greatly impact Europe-China
relations]{.underline}**. \"**[There are very serious situations in
Europe. And I think this is a serious situation in Europe that is going
to force NATO to be less ambitious in thinking about China and more

than that]{.underline}**.\"

### Impacts \-\-- Focus Deters China/China War

#### NATO is perfectly positioned to deter China

On the eve of the NATO Summit in London last December, th**[e Alliance's
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed the need for a collective
response to China's emergence as a global power.]{.underline}** "This is
not about moving NATO into the South China Sea," he stated, "but it's
about **[taking into account that China is coming closer to us---in the
Arctic, in Africa, investing heavily in our infrastructure in
Europe]{.underline}**, in cyberspace." At the summit, NATO heads of
state diplomatically declared that China has become a concern**[: "we
recognize that China's growing influence and international policies
present both opportunities and challenges that we need to address
together as an Alliance."]{.underline}** Indeed, it is hard, if not
impossible, for NATO to avoid China. Beijing presents a full spectrum
challenge to the transatlantic community---a challenge whose potential
mirrors, if not surpasses, that once posed by the former Soviet Union.
China's \$14 trillion economy is expected to soon surpass that of the
United States, and Beijing exercises that might in a predatory fashion
around the globe, including in the United States and Europe. China
threatens to boycott companies and countries that criticize its
policies, leverages its debt instruments against poor nations, and is
buying up critical infrastructure around the world. Its acquisition of
European ports has raised concerns of top NATO commanders who warn that
such ownership could adversely affect the Alliance's ability to use
those facilities in times of crisis. China is a technological challenge
to the West. It is a leader in 5G communications, artificial
intelligence, hyper-sonic weapons, and quantum computing. It has
demonstrated repeatedly that it is willing to exercise that prowess
against Western interests and security. Chinese cyber espionage and
disinformation campaigns have become part of daily life for all NATO
allies, including both their governments and private enterprises.
Beijing's military is a major driver behind China's technological edge
and is developing and exercising global reach. China's \$260 billion
defense budget has a purchasing power estimated to equal or exceed 70
percent of that of the US defense budget. China's military cooperation
with Russia continues to expand and the two exercise not only in the
plains of Central Asia but in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. Chinese
military forces are the pointy of end of the spear Beijing uses to
undermine the rules based international order. Its maritime claims and
aggressive activities in South and East China Seas stand among its more
prominent actions. And, China's leadership relishes its role as an
ideological challenge to the West and the latter's practice of liberal
democracy. China usesits economic, technological, and military power to
promote globally its form of national authoritarianism. Beijing even
asserts that its political model has provided the most adept and agile
response to today's coronavirus epidemic. So how should NATO should
respond to China's growing global assertiveness? What should be NATO's
China strategy? When considering this issue, it is important to
recognize that **[the foundation for a relevant NATO role in a
transatlantic China strategy has long been established]{.underline}**.
For decades, the Alliance has been operating around the world. NATO has
led the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan since
2003. Its naval forces have patrolled against pirates off the shores of
Africa, commencing with operation OCEAN SHIELD in 2008. As a member of
the Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO provides training to military
establishments across the Middle East. And, on a daily basis the
Alliance addresses terrorism, cyber-threats, disinformation, and other
global issues. **[Most relevant to addressing China are the Alliance's
long-standing relationships with key democracies of the Indo-Pacific
region. NATO established Global Partnerships with Korea, New Zealand,
and Mongolia in 2012, Australia in 2013, and Japan in
2014.]{.underline}** These relationships are predominantly consultative,
but most of these partners have contributed to NATO missions, including
in Afghanistan. **[As the transatlantic community's lead instrument for
security collaboration, NATO can contribute to the former's relationship
with China in three important ways. As a multinational security forum,
it can foster among NATO allies and partners a shared awareness of
China's capacities and activities that generate risk to and opportunity
for the North Atlantic community. NATO has long served as an important
forum through which its Allies and partners share intelligence data and
assessments needed to foster and facilitate collaborative
action]{.underline}**. Second, **[NATO can help develop and promulgate a
transatlantic security strategy and posture regarding
China]{.underline}**. That strategy's objectives should include the
development of a cooperative relationship with China as well the
dissuasion of China from undermining the interests of the transatlantic
community. The latter would **[define the appropriate role and means for
the Alliance to contribute to deterrence and when necessary defense
against Chinese aggression that imperil those interests.]{.underline}**
Third, N**[ATO's civilian and military capacities should be used to
facilitate the defense and security component of a Western strategy
addressing China---including in the tasks of engagement, deterrence, and
defense]{.underline}**. The following are five actions NATO could
undertake as part of its approach to China, none of which would require
it to undertake a significant reprioritization of its current mission
sets and all of which would support the aforementioned: **[The Alliance
should offer to establish a NATO-China Council]{.underline}**. This
would mirror the NATO-Russia Council whose roots date back to 1997. Its
establishment would recognize and respond to the realty of China's
growing influence and reach. This forum would spur Alliance members to
more seriously and comprehensively address in a coordinated manner the
challenges posed by China. Its establishment would underscore that this
dimension of great power competition is not between China and the United
States but between China and the transatlantic community, one bound by
shared values, interests, and history. And this forum could be used to
identify and foster opportunities for constructive collaboration with
China, such as counter-piracy operations. Second, **[NATO should deepen
its engagement with its Pacific partners, Australia, New Zealand, the
Republic of Korea, Japan, and Mongolia.]{.underline}** The consultative
dimension of these relationships should be complemented with more
regular and more robust military exercises (especially air, maritime,
and special forces exercises) and operations, including those designed
to ensure freedom of navigation. Such events under the NATO flag would
be a useful complement to US maritime and air exercisers in the Pacific
that have long featured the participation of European allies. Past US
RIMPAC exercise series, for example, have included military aircraft,
ships, and staffs from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In less tense times, China
even participated in RIMPAC events. Third, **[the Alliance should
establish in the Indo-Pacific, perhaps]{.underline}** in one of the
region's partner countries, a Center of Excellence (COE) and integrate
officers and NCOs from selected partners into the Alliance's Command
Structure. Both initiatives would help increase the Alliance's
understanding of the Indo-Pacific region, institutionalize its presence
in the region, and deepen these partners' familiarization with NATO
missions, structures, and protocols. **[The Alliance should also
establish a small military headquarters element in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}**, perhaps embedded in the COE or in United States
Pacific Command to help facilitate and coordinate NATO exercises and
operations. It, too, could contribute to Alliance's awareness of
developments in the region and, if the opportunity emerges, Alliance
collaboration with China. These initiatives will take effort to launch
and execute. Some allies will balk at adding additional missions to NATO
and their own military forces when resources are already strained. But
the aforementioned will not generate onerous costs and can build upon
European, US, and Canadian military operations in the Pacific that are
already the norm. Moreover, European attitudes toward China have
significantly hardened. Eighteen months ago, many Europeans were content
to regard China as an economic partner, notwithstanding its
authoritarian political system and aggressive conduct in the Pacific.
That has since changed as Europe has experienced with increasing
frequency Beijing's diplomatic and economic belligerence toward those
that criticize its actions and policies. In March 2019 the European
Union formally described China as a "strategic competitor," "an economic
competitor," and "a systemic rival promoting alternative models of
governance." Beijing pugnacious conduct during the coronavirus pandemic
has only reinforced this new European perspective. Beijing will likely
balk at the offer of a NATO-China council as it will oppose an increased
NATO presence in the Indo-China, especially one that fosters deeper
political-military collaboration among the region's democracies. Even
NATO Partners in Asia may balk at elevating their relations with NATO
out of a desire to avoid further complicating relations with China.
**[NATO may have to initiate its China strategy on its
own,]{.underline}** leveraging the territories Allies control in the
Indo-Pacific and conducting its own operations and exercises in the
region. That will **[demonstrate the commitment and determination
necessary to earn the confidence and support of its partners for a more
active Alliance presence in the region. China will then also be likely
to demur, realizing that having regular communication with the world's
most powerful military alliance can be important means to avoid
conflict, promote peace, and facilitate mutually useful
cooperation.]{.underline}** A NATO strategy for China alone will be not
a sufficient solution to the West's increasingly tense relationship with
Beijing**[. A coherent and effective transatlantic strategy for China
will have to be comprehensive, one that leverages the full complement of
diplomatic, economic, technological, social, and military capabilities
and dynamics that define geopolitical power. For it to have maximum
success it will have to combine the capacities of both Europe and North
America and be reinforced through collaboration with community's
democratic partners in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. **[As the
institution that effectively marshals the military capabilities of the
transatlantic community and one that has established relationships with
the leading states of the Indo-Pacific, NATO is well positioned to
foster that collaboration. Such NATO engagement would help underscore
that Beijing's belligerence risks provoking a geopolitically costly
reaction from a vibrant and unified global coalition of
democracies]{.underline}**. NATO's potential role in a transatlantic
strategy regarding China should not be underestimated.

#### Reorganizing NATO priorities around deterring China/Russia is necessary and good -- commitment and first steps happening now.

As promised, President Biden and his administration are moving swiftly
to repair America's damaged relationship with its NATO allies ---
following four years in which President Donald Trump bitterly complained
that they weren't pulling their weight. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's
first official call after his confirmation was to the long-suffering
head of the NATO alliance, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg; Biden
followed up by releasing a video of his own call with Stoltenberg,
purposefully going beyond the traditional print "readout." "We've got a
mountain of work to do ahead of us, from covid to climate to tackling
security challenges," Biden told the NATO head. But once the "America is
back" calls and speeches are finished, the Biden team must face the hard
task of preparing NATO for its next chapter. Thirty years after the fall
of the Soviet Union, the mission of this organization founded after
World War II to safeguard the freedom of Western Europe and North
America is no longer clear. Restoring European allies' trust in U.S.
competence won't be enough to rehabilitate the transatlantic partnership
if the allies don't solve this identity crisis. With Trump gone, the
alliance can't simply go back to business as usual --- because for some
time now business as usual in NATO has meant taking on more and more
roles and activities in a frantic quest for relevance. And while Trump
absolutely damaged the alliance, it would be foolhardy to blame all of
its problems on him: Mission drift, for instance, long predated his
administration. **[A longer-term corrective may involve reorienting the
security organization's focus toward its traditional role of deterring
and defending against strategic competitors: Russia,]{.underline}** yes,
but even more so **[China. That nation is the obvious successor to the
mid-20th-century Soviet Union in harboring global ideological
aspirations at odds with those of the major Western
democracies]{.underline}** The end of the Cold War understandably
precipitated NATO's identity crisis. With U.S. guidance, the
organization pivoted away from its longtime focus on collective defense
against Moscow --- an attack on one member would be considered an attack
on all --- toward a global peace-enforcement role. The security of
nations outside the alliance became a concern on the theory that
instability and violence beyond NATO's borders could spill over onto
alliance territory, and because intervention to stop humanitarian
catastrophes was seen as inherently right. (In the 1990s, then-Sen.
Richard Lugar famously declared that the alliance must go "out of area"
lest it risk going "out of business.") This shift was accompanied by
expansion: Since the late '90s, NATO has nearly doubled its membership,
from 16 to 30, incorporating states that were once part of the Soviet
Union, like Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, or members of the Warsaw
Treaty Organization, like Poland. Early examples of NATO's new role
included the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 to halt violence against
Kosovar civilians perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic's regime, followed
by peacekeeping duties there. In 2003, NATO took on the task of
enforcing peace in Afghanistan after the invasion by a U.S.-led
coalition. In 2011, it intervened in Libya to impose a U.N. Security
Council cease-fire resolution on the Moammar Gaddafi regime. Obama
embraced 'endless wars.' Biden probably will, too. Civil strife and
violence in these and other hotspots are unlikely to recede anytime
soon, but NATO is ill equipped to fix such **[problems. Worldwide crisis
stabilization is too open-ended a goal to serve as the organizing
principle for a military alliance --- and such ambitions stretch
valuable NATO resources at a time when threats to the North Atlantic
region are growing. Refocusing NATO to check the dangers posed by
China's rise would restore it to something closer to its original
mission of safeguarding allies from strategic
competitors]{.underline}**. What about Russia? It remains meddlesome,
but it is largely under control --- and a shadow of its former self.
**[Yes, Moscow retains the ability to wreak havoc in any manner of ways,
but in conventional military terms it doesn't pose the same threat to
the alliance it once did, and NATO has moved swiftly to counter what
threat there i]{.underline}**s. Following Russia's 2014 annexation of
Crimea, NATO established new commands and headquarters in Poland, Latvia
and Romania --- its biggest investment in force structure since the Cold
War. There remain areas of internal disagreement: On matters like the
spreading of misinformation in elections, some European members ---
France, for instance --- seem inclined to shrug off President Vladimir
Putin's provocations. And Germany in particular is eager to embrace
financial and energy collaborations with Russia (though it faces
pressure to back off as Putin clamps down on dissidents). Putin will use
these splits to try to divide the allies against themselves, but **[on
the big question --- checking and containing Russian military
adventurism --- NATO is united, and effective.]{.underline}** It is
China that represents the bigger menace over the long term to Western
values and interests. At present, China is primarily an economic and
political threat, not a military one, but NATO should prepare for the
latter possibility, given Beijing's increasingly assertive foreign
policy. After all, it has cracked down on Hong Kong, clashed with India
in the Himalayas, levied tariffs on Australia after officials criticized
its handling of the coronavirus, and said Britain would "bear the
consequences" for excluding telecom firm Huawei from its 5G network.
China has been steadily investing in European infrastructure: State-run
shipping companies own significant stakes in 13 European ports, for
instance, and the telecom equipment company ZTE has a large presence in
southeastern Europe. When countries cede control of their
infrastructure, their "resilience," or ability to recover from the shock
of a natural disaster or armed attack, suffers. (Maintaining resilience
is a core part of NATO's mission statement.) Such developments also make
it easier for Beijing to impose its will on NATO members --- by
threatening to end access to a port, say. China has already proved
itself adept at using other tools in its arsenal --- such as economic
influence --- to intimidate and coerce states, as when Beijing imposed
an eight-year ban on Norwegian salmon in retaliation for the awarding of
the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident. To safeguard against
a future when China decides to use its growing military power in similar
fashion, NATO should invest more in military assets and planning today.
**[Narrowing the alliance's focus and prioritizing China]{.underline}**
hardly mean that NATO-flagged vessels would appear tomorrow in the South
China Sea, where Beijing has been expanding its naval bases. The shift
would, at least at first, **[represent more of a change in strategic
mind-set.]{.underline}** But China has already begun to encroach on the
North Atlantic region. In the Arctic, for example, Beijing is working on
liquid-natural-gas drilling projects with Russia; it is also sending
icebreakers to the Norwegian Sea. To address these developments, **[NATO
could start by formally including the "High North" in its strategic
documents for the first time and by increasing its presence in the
region. Biden certainly seems focused on China at the national level ---
promising to maintain Trump's tougher stance, without the
counterproductive measures (like tariffs)]{.underline}** --- but it is
not clear that his administration has grasped the **[role NATO can
pla]{.underline}**y. When the president spoke with Stoltenberg, he
proposed adding global issues ranging from democratic backsliding to
climate change and the pandemic to the alliance's agenda. Defense
Secretary Austin similarly identified a laundry list of tasks, including
tackling corruption and international criminal organizations, during the
NATO defense ministers' meeting in February. Still, **[at a Munich
Security Conference event last month, Biden said that America and its
allies "must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with
China." And there's a growing movement in D.C. think tanks --- from
which Biden is drawing many of his advisers --- arguing for such an
orientation. Stoltenberg, an early and frequent advocate of having NATO
address the implications of China's rise, would be a key figure in the
refocusing: In his own comments at the Munich gathering, he stressed
that China is the "defining issue" for the transatlantic relationship.
Stoltenberg and a group tasked with charting the alliance's long-term
course --- the NATO 2030 working group --- have recommended deepening
and broadening relationships with partners in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}**. By necessity, **[refocusing on China would
involve curtailing NATO's other sprawling activities]{.underline}** ---
beneficial in itself. Beyond ending the training and advising missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan, pausing NATO expansion would make sense, since
it would be inadvisable to add new members --- such as Ukraine and
Georgia, thereby provoking Russia --- as it works out its identity
crisis. Russia is already pretty much contained; admitting Ukraine and
Georgia, a move for which many Europeans have little appetite anyway,
would doom arms-control and other negotiations with Moscow. Regrettably,
as with Russia, Europe is divided over how to deal with China. Many
European allies are wary of picking sides in the struggle for influence
between the United States and its Asian rival. Some, like Germany, even
appear outright resentful at the suggestion that they must choose.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed last year to conclude the
E.U.-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment --- even though the
incoming U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had strongly
signaled that Europe should wait till Biden's inauguration. China's rise
is indisputably the most significant geopolitical development of the
21st century. It would be strange for an alliance as potent as NATO to
ignore the challenge. A Europe that continues to downplay the danger
posed by China's growing influence in the North Atlantic area could lead
Xi to succeed where Trump and Putin failed: He could splinter the
alliance. International organizations like NATO move slowly, and it will
take time to lay the groundwork for tackling the security implications
of China's ascendance. By beginning that shift now, the alliance may
avoid a greater challenge later.

**[At their recent meeting in Brussels, NATO leaders agreed an ambitious
transatlantic agenda for the future: NATO 2030. The alliance is
determined to address global developments relevant to its security by
strengthening and broadening political consultations]{.underline}**;
further enhancing resilience; fostering technological innovation;
tackling the implications of climate change as a threat multiplier; and
**[increasing cooperation with partners, including in the Asia-Pacific.
The vigorous implementation of these commitments will help NATO to deal
with the strategic implications of China's rise to world power
status.]{.underline}** For the first time, **[NATO acknowledges that
China's ambitions, strategy, and behaviour present systemic challenges
to alliance security. It is determined to "engage China with a view to
defending the security interest of the Alliance."]{.underline}** At the
same time**[, Russia's aggressive actions continue to constitute a
threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Its growing cooperation with China
carries the risk of concurrent strategic challenges in the Euro-Atlantic
and Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**s. **[The United States considers
China its primary strategic competitor and is shifting its strategic
focus to the Asia-Pacific. NATO must therefore ensure Euro-Atlantic
stability. Credible deterrence and defense against Russia remain its
priority task. The new Strategic Concept must address all these
challenges, ensure a shared strategic vision, and strengthen alliance
cohesion.]{.underline}** KATE HANSEN BUNDTSECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
NORWEGIAN ATLANTIC COMMITTEE **[NATO's joint statement on China as a
systemic challenge to the rules-based international order and the
summit's approval of the NATO 2030 reform package were necessary steps
in NATO getting ready for China.]{.underline}** But this was far from
saying that China is a challenge that will trigger conventional military
use or out-of-area operations for NATO. NATO needs to confront China in
areas where it poses a challenge to the alliance. Facing cyber,
technological, and other asymmetric threats, such as disinformation
campaigns and attempts to influence political decisionmaking processes,
calls for action. And clearly, out-of-area does not apply to these
threats. China is becoming a global power in terms of high technology.
Chinese companies are already center stage when it comes to surveillance
technology. And in the race to control and influence the global digital
infrastructure, China is playing an increasingly bigger role in the
development of technological standards. It is also expanding its nuclear
programs. Together this is challenging alliance security and democratic
values. In addition, China has been growing as a global economic
superpower through its direct investments in European infrastructure,
which also calls for allied awareness. **[If NATO members are to protect
their common values, it is vital that they stand up against
authoritarian forces that want to undermine the allies. Following the
summit this week, NATO member states have jointly agreed that this is a
battle they want to take on together.]{.underline}** RALUCA
CSERNATONIVISITING SCHOLAR AT CARNEGIE EUROPE The rise of China and the
evolving Sino-U.S. great power rivalry are the defining geopolitical
features of our time. They will unquestionably have a defining impact on
NATO's 2030 agenda and its new Strategic Concept. China's rise as a
high-tech great power and systemic challenger should be seen as an
opportunity to remember NATO's very purpose as a high-level political
and military organization. But **[NATO requires the United States and
the EU to come together and improve joint strategic awareness, encourage
a coherent Euro-Atlantic approach for the Indo-Pacific, and recommit to
the defense of common democratic values and a rules-based international
order.]{.underline}** **[A first step in the right direction was NATO
leaders taking a tougher line on China at the Brussels
summit.]{.underline}** Details about a specific NATO China policy in the
communiqué were sparse. But an emphasis on China shows that the
alliance's traditional and still almost exclusive Russia focus is
slightly shifting. China's military reach is getting closer to the
Euro-Atlantic area. It will likely challenge the alliance's ability to
build collective resilience, safeguard critical infrastructure, address
emerging and disruptive technologies, and protect sensitive supply
chains. Such wide-ranging challenges are complex. They will require a
comprehensive EU-U.S. **[NATO approach and a shared vision as well as a
constructive dialogue with China where possible. The alliance will also
need to overcome substantial and potentially show-stopping
intra-alliance political and military organizational
hurdles.]{.underline}** Closer cooperation with the EU, given its
regulatory, economic, and technological innovation instruments, would
also enable NATO to respond to the multifaceted risks and threats of
this new era. MARTA DASSÙSENIOR DIRECTOR OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AT THE
ASPEN INSTITUTE If "ready" means that **[NATO is able and willing to
consider China as a potential security challenge, NATO is ready. China
will figure prominently in the new Strategic Concept, to be approved in
2022. For the first time in a NATO communiqué, China's military buildup
is considered to be a systemic challenge to alliance security. And
NATO's new global agenda entails commitments in critical fields,
amplified by or related to China's rise: from value chains'
vulnerabilities in strategic sectors to the need to preserve a
technology edge in defense; from countering cyber attacks---mostly from
Russia but also from China---to reinforcing resilience of democratic
societies.]{.underline}** If, however, "ready" means that NATO will
engage military in the Asia-Pacific region, this is not the case: NATO
is not turning into a Sino-centric alliance. And Washington is not
asking NATO to support the United States militarily in Asia. Joe Biden
is suggesting, instead, a new transatlantic bargain: NATO, with renewed
American commitment, will focus mainly on Europe and collective
defense---and here Russia remains the main military threat for the
alliance. At the same time, European allies will support Washington in
containing China, first of all in diplomatic and economic terms. Is
Europe ready to sustain its part of the bargain? This is the key

#### NATO is investing in Russia and China deterrence now -- solves

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine dominated the NATO defense ministers\'
meeting in Brussels, but the ministers --- including Secretary of
Defense Lloyd J. Austin III --- also considered a range of actions and
programs in preparation for the Madrid Summit on June 29. Not since the
fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 has there been as serious a threat as
Russia\'s unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday at a press conference. This
drastically changed the security environment in Europe and the globe, he
said. \"We must set out NATO\'s response for the longer term,\" he said.
\"At the summit, we will take decisions to make NATO even stronger and
more agile in a world that is more dangerous and more competitive. I am
confident that the Madrid Summit will be a transformative summit.\"
**[The secretary general said there are a number of areas where the
heads of state and government will make decisions in Madrid. He expects
the 30 NATO nations to significantly beef up deterrence and
defense.]{.underline}** \"**[We will also decide on a new NATO strategic
concept, setting out our position on Russia, on emerging challenges, and
--- for the first time --- on China]{.underline}**,\" he said. \"And in
this context, I welcome that **[the leaders of our Asia-Pacific partners
will take part in our summit for the first time.\" The Indo-Pacific
nations that will attend the summit are Australia, Japan, New Zealand
and South Korea.]{.underline}** Spotlight: Focus on Indo-Pacific The
leaders will also look at better burden-sharing and resourcing for the
alliance. Finally, they\'ll discuss the historic applications for NATO
membership by Finland and Sweden, he said. The defense ministers looked
at all these areas and made progress, the secretary general said. **[The
ministers met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov and got
an update on the situation in the embattled country. \"We addressed the
imperative need for our continued support, as Russia conducts a
relentless war of attrition against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said. \"NATO
allies and partners have been providing Ukraine \[with\] unprecedented
support, so that it can defend itself against Moscow\'s aggression.\"
Many NATO countries --- including the United States --- have announced
additional assistance, including much needed heavy weapons and
long-range systems.]{.underline}** But as Russian President Vladimir
Putin\'s war continues, the ministers discussed plans to support Ukraine
for the long haul. \"**[We are putting together a NATO comprehensive
assistance package for Ukraine, helping Ukraine improve interoperability
with NATO, transitioning from Soviet-era to modern NATO equipment, and
further strengthening security institutions]{.underline}**,\"
Stoltenberg said. Spotlight: Support for Ukraine \"Russia\'s aggression
is a game-changer,\" he said. \"So, NATO must maintain credible
deterrence and strong defense.\" The defense ministers addressed the
scale and design of our future posture --- the so-called footprint of
NATO forces in Europe. They also discussed how the alliance can work in
all domains of warfare: land, sea, air, cyberspace and space. On land,
the idea is \"**[more NATO forward-deployed combat formations to
strengthen our battlegroups in the eastern part of our
alliance]{.underline}**,\" Stoltenberg said. He said there will be more
air, sea and cyber defenses, as well as pre-positioned equipment and
weapon stockpiles. The strategy calls for a new force model, \"**[with
more forces at higher readiness and specific forces pre-assigned to the
defense of specific allies to enable much faster
reinforcement]{.underline}**,\" he said. \"A number of allies have
committed to contribute to our stronger presence in the eastern part of
our alliance. But we still have some work to do as we look to the
summit, where I expect further announcements.\"

#### Active denial solves China \[short\]

Even as events in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine have captured the attention
of U.S. foreign policy elites, the United States faces key questions
about its military position in Asia. In **[the face of growing Chinese
power, can the United States continue to provide a credible deterrent in
Asia without either bankrupting itself or pursuing risky strategies that
raise new questions about crisis stability?]{.underline}** While other
security issues remain important, none will have a more fundamental
effect on the U.S. military budget or the way the United States does
business overseas. Basic precepts of U.S. foreign and security policy
are under debate. Notable commentators have recently argued that U.S.
forward defenses in Asia are no longer viable and that the United States
should transition to a less engaged strategy of "offshore balancing."
Others have countered that the right combination of new technologies and
offensive systems might yet restore U.S. dominance. While we welcome the
new debate, neither of the most prominent alternative approaches is
advisable. The United States requires a new strategy, one that does more
to assure U.S. partners than offshore balancing but that is also
affordable and does not rely on a vulnerable hair-trigger offensive
posture. Fortunately, **[the United States could realize such a
strategy, though it would require significant diplomatic efforts as well
as a variety of military adjustments. What we label an "active denial
strategy" would maintain a forward presence but be oriented toward
denying an opponent the benefits of military aggression, rather than
trying to ensure a decisive defeat. The strategy would have three
primary features: first, a resilient force posture and the exploitation
of strategic depth; second, a focus on combat against offensive maneuver
forces instead of strikes against home territories; and third,
leveraging the capabilities of allies and partners. This active denial
strategy aligns well with the status quo nature of U.S. interests and
provides a cost-effective deterrent that would reduce rather than
increase the incentives for pre-emption during crises.
What]{.underline}** follows is an outline of the challenges facing U.S.
diplomats and commanders in Asia, the state of the debate on U.S.
military strategy today, and an alternative to current options that
offers a better combination of attributes.

#### Active denial strategy of deterrence effectively solves Chinese adventurism by flipping their cost-exchange ratio -- prevents US-China war \[long\]

**Heginbotham and Heim '15** \-- (Eric Heginbotham, Jacob L. Heim,
06-03-2015, \"Deterring Without Dominance,\" The Washington Quarterly,
v.38, no. 1, Spring 2015, p.185-199,

**[An active denial strategy seeks to deter Chinese adventurism by
maintaining a capability to refuse China the benefits of military
aggression.]{.underline}** This is different than maintaining
all-aspects dominance. Dominance is fast becoming prohibitively
expensive and may well be inadvisable when confronting a nuclear-armed
great power. Instead, **[active denial involves both defending the
territory of U.S. allies and partners as well as making retaliatory
strikes against Chinese combat forces involved in offensive operations.
The active denial strategy differs from the offshore control strategy by
meeting Chinese aggression directly, thereby making it more difficult
for China to achieve a fait accompli.]{.underline}** Unlike the
alternative approaches outlined earlier, active denial offers a broad
strategy that includes many branch options for a U.S. president.
**[There are three mutually-reinforcing components of the active denial
strategy. The first is resilient U.S. combat power, capable of surviving
a pre-emptive Chinese strike; this will require a portfolio of
adjustments to survivability and deployment patterns. The second is
capabilities optimized for attacking Chinese forces directly engaged in
offensive operations such as amphibious ships, aircraft, and landed
forces. And the third is bolstering and leveraging the capabilities of
allies and partners. The United States should assist partners in
improving their defensive capabilities (create mini-A2/AD bubbles) as
well as fully using the geographic advantages offered by partner
states.]{.underline}** A Resilient Force **[Surviving a pre-emptive
Chinese strike requires that U.S. forces be resilient in the face of
Chinese attacks. This includes a portfolio of measures including
hardening airbase facilities; dispersing aircraft and other critical
assets; prepositioning missile defenses; employing camouflage and
concealment, electronic warfare, and rapid repair capabilities; as well
as developing procedures and training for fighting under
attack.]{.underline}** Making aircraft carriers and air bases
operationally resilient introduces risk into Chinese military options by
denying the PLA confidence in its ability to suppress U.S. air power.
Dispersal can take two forms. On-base dispersal spreads aircraft,
maintenance equipment, and fuel supplies around a given base and
minimizes the amount of damage that a single arriving weapon can do.
Theater-level dispersal spreads aircraft across more locations in order
to minimize the impact of losing any single location. U.S. Marine Corps
concepts for distributed operations using the short takeoff and vertical
landing F-35B from improvised bases offer an extreme example of
theater-level dispersal. The Marines have also demonstrated their
capability to operate conventional fighters from expeditionary
airfields, for example during the 2012 Geiger Fury exercise held on the
island of Tinian in the Northern Marianas. In a similar vein, the U.S.
Air Force has developed a "Rapid Raptor" concept for quickly deploying
F-22 fighters to austere locations for short periods. **[Dispersal will
stress combat support capacity, likely requiring Army support for key
enablers such as logistics, security forces, and combat engineers. All
of these dispersal concepts would complicate Chinese targeting and offer
survivability benefits]{.underline}**. In addition to dispersal, **[the
operational resilience portfolio will need to include some hardening of
key facilities (air bases, command-and-control centers, and
ports).]{.underline}** Hardening key nodes at those facilities (e.g.,
communications, fuel storage, and aircraft) can be a cost-effective way
to mitigate vulnerabilities. This could involve reinforcing existing
buildings with steel or concrete or constructing new bunkers and
underground facilities (if local geography permits). However, attempting
to make entire facilities invulnerable is prohibitively costly, and
probably unrealistic. Therefore, hardening efforts must pursue
cost-effective ways of protecting critical capabilities. U.S. forces
would come under the most intense attacks at the start of a conflict.
Consequently, **[a resilient force posture would seek to exploit U.S.
strategic depth in Asia.]{.underline}** At the outset, relatively more
U.S. forces might be deployed at a distance from China, rather than
being concentrated overwhelmingly in China's immediate periphery as they
are today. **[Long-range bombers flying from lower threat areas, in
conjunction with submarines firing cruise missiles, could provide a
great deal of U.S. combat power during the opening phase of a conflict.
Resilient air bases and carriers near conflict areas will generate
sorties to support these other assets, and will become a primary means
of attack as adversary surveillance capabilities are diminished and
missiles inventories exhausted.]{.underline}** Missile defenses (such as
Navy ships armed with SM-3 interceptors and the Army's Patriot air
defense system) can intercept some portion of incoming ballistic
missiles. These capabilities are far from perfect but they can reduce
the number of missiles that could reach defended aircraft carriers and
bases, forcing an adversary to expend more missiles to achieve its goals
and drawing down its finite quiver of ballistic missiles more quickly.
In the future, directed energy systems might augment these layered
defenses.14 Camouflage, concealment, and deception could complicate
China's ability to locate U.S. forces. A final component of the
resilience portfolio lies in rapid repair capabilities. The U.S. Air
Force recently demonstrated a rapid runway repair capability able to
fill dozens of craters in an air base's runways and taxiways in eight
hours.15 In the event of a conflict, this resilience portfolio would
multiply targets and confuse PLA planners, thereby minimizing the damage
that a Chinese attack could do and enabling U.S. forces to rapidly
rebound from what damage did occur. **[Although U.S. forces would
initially be deployed in greater depth than they are today, resilience
would not require ceding ground to China from the outset.]{.underline}**
Some U.S. forces would remain in areas close to China during peacetime
and at the outset of a conflict**[. And as the war progressed, the
resilient force posture would permit U.S. forces to shift their center
of gravity back towards the Chinese mainland]{.underline}**. Countering
Attacking Forces A robust ability to counter Chinese power projection
will require another portfolio of capabilities. The United States must
be prepared to counter power projection in three domains: naval forces,
air power, and landed forces. The strategy focuses on defeating PLA
assets beyond China's shores, rather than on striking mainland targets.
In countering Chinese naval forces, **[U.S. submarines will continue to
have a significant advantage over Chinese anti-submarine warfare
capabilities.]{.underline}** But U.S. submarines have capacity
limitations both in how many torpedoes each carries and how many
submarines can operate in a given area. In addition to submarines, the
military will need an expanded inventory of joint long-range anti-ship
missiles. Integrating such missiles on U.S. Air Force aircraft will
expand anti-surface warfare capacity. Land-based anti-ship cruise
missiles, either operated by the Army or by U.S. allies, could also play
a role, as could modern anti-ship mines. Expanding the ability to
air-deliver mines from stand-off ranges would give the U.S. military
additional flexibility and free up other highdemand assets such as
submarines. **[In countering Chinese air power, the first line of
defense would be provided by U.S. aircraft from aircraft carriers and
resilient ground bases working in conjunction with allied air
forces.]{.underline}** Air defenses, in the form of U.S. Navy air
defense destroyers and cruisers or land-based air defenses such as the
Patriot system, could provide a second line of defense. Allies and
partners could contribute to this second line of defense with their own
assets. These could be bolstered by foreign military sales facilitated
by the United States and possibly by Japan, which has recently relaxed
its ban on arms exports. To defeat landed forces, a combination of
capabilities would again be required. Many of the same weapons needed to
attack adversary surface warfare groups could be used to interdict
amphibious forces before they reached land. A suite of weapons could be
used against beachheads, including air-delivered weapons optimized to
attack ground forces (such as cluster munitions and sensor-fused
weapons), naval fires (land-attack missiles and, in the future, perhaps
rail guns), and ground-based fires (including artillery, multiple-launch
rocket systems, and anti-tank guided missiles). **[The ultimate means of
reducing Chinese ground forces is through land power, ideally that of a
partner or ally but potentially with U.S. support]{.underline}**.
Leveraging Allied Strengths **[The third component of a denial strategy
is buttressing allied strengths and capitalizing on partner geography.
One possibility is to assist allies and partners in creating their own
A2/AD zones equipped with air defenses, anti-ship cruise missiles,
mines, and sensor networks.]{.underline}** By focusing on defensive
weapons, the effort would seek to **[make U.S. partners and allies
dangerous porcupines whose capabilities would only be a threat to an
aggressor seeking to change the status quo]{.underline}**. A second
important facet will be improving partners' ability to operate with U.S.
forces. Measures could include combined training exercises, data sharing
procedures, military advisors, embedded liaisons, and prepositioned
supplies to enable U.S. forces to rapidly deploy into the country.
During peacetime, the sales of key defensive systems and combined
training exercises will demonstrate the challenges China would face if
it attempted to change the status quo through force. Increasing the
scope and frequency of exercises would also improve familiarity between
the United States and its partners, enabling them to operate together
better should deterrence fail. The April 2014 agreement with the
Philippines regarding an expanded U.S. rotational presence is an
important step in deepening contact between the U.S. military and key
allies and partners.16 Shifting the Cost-Exchange Ratio **[All three
elements of the denial strategy are designed to turn the tyranny of
distance on its head, or at least to neutralize the most significant
disadvantages posed by geography. China can, and likely will, build
power projection forces (]{.underline}**i.e. longer-range missiles,
aerial tankers, longer-range bombers, and improved satellitebased
communications and surveillance) to challenge the United States farther
from its coast. But **[these systems will begin to place China on the
losing side of cost-exchange ratios.]{.underline}** The two-stage
missiles required to strike targets beyond roughly 1,000 kilometers are
more expensive than singlestage systems, and all other things equal,
doubling the range of a bomber roughly doubles its cost. In summary**[,
the resiliency measures described above make U.S. forces less lucrative
targets against which China would have to launch more expensive missiles
and bombers. If executed correctly, this strategy would proliferate
targets more quickly and more cheaply than China could add to its
missile inventory.]{.underline}** On the U.S. side, although many of the
capabilities required for an active denial strategy would be provided by
legacy systems (such as Virginia-class attack submarines and long-range
cruise missiles carried by B-52 and B-1 bombers) some new or expanded
capabilities would be required. Improving the resilience of air bases
and the survivability of aircraft carriers would require new spending in
areas such as electronic warfare, rapid repair capabilities, and
hardening. The most expensive element would likely be missile defenses
with, for example, a single SM-3 interceptor costing approximately \$10
million.17 Although some new capabilities would be required under an
active denial strategy, their total costs would be far less than those
associated with a strategy aimed at restoring all-aspects dominance.
Moreover, the strategy would probably not require an increase in the
overall defense budget. Curtailing investment in conventional prompt
global strike and reducing the F-35 buy, which would become less
critical under a strategy that does not depend on penetrating Chinese
mainland air defenses, are savings that could pay for the active denial
strategy. As of 2013, the total acquisition cost of the F-35 program was
estimated at over \$320 billion (in 2012 dollars).18 The F-35 will still
be a key U.S. Air Force capability, and one that is critical for air
superiority, but fewer of these aircraft would be required under a
strategy predicated on a dynamic defense-in-depth, or active denial
strategy.

**[If a conflict with China arises, the United States will need a
strong, cohesive NATO]{.underline}**, as well as other partnerships
around the world **[to maintain order and security]{.underline}** in
Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond**[. The United States
remains committed to Europe's security and stability. But it also
expects its European allies to pick up their share of the burden for
collective securit]{.underline}**y so as to help maintain order in the
continent and around the globe. **[It is of vital importance to the
United States that its defense and security relationship with European
countries, especially within NATO, not only remains healthy but is
correctly oriented to current and likely future
challenges.]{.underline}** Several things remain to be achieved if
**[Europe and the United States]{.underline}** in this regard. First,
they **[must build a common approach]{.underline}** not only **[in
defense]{.underline}**, but across **[economic, information, and
political domains.]{.underline}** Second, they must solve the
**[continued inequity in burden sharing that hinders a stronger
relationship between them and erodes the confidence of many Americans in
the efficacy of NATO]{.underline}**. Third, it is necessary to achieve
greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Black Sea
region. Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve its deterrence
capability against Russia's aggressive behavior. The interests and
responsibilities of the United States are global, with freedom of
navigation on the seas and preservation of the global commons being
prime examples. Its allies and partners benefit from these freedoms as
well, but these have now **[come under threat, most notably in the South
China Sea and with China's growing control over much of the
infrastructure of the world, particularly in Europe and Africa. The
threat from China is real and growing]{.underline}**, and if it
materializes the United States will need a strong, cohesive NATO, as
well as other partnerships around the world to maintain order and
security in Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond, while the
majority of its forces and capabilities, particularly air and naval
ones, are operating in the Pacific theater. **[The stability, security,
and economic prosperity of the United States are directly linked to that
of Europe. The bulk of its global economic relationships are in North
America and the European Union, and the majority of its most reliable
allies and partners are in Europe.]{.underline}** To give but one
example, the shared intelligence obtained from Europe is essential to
the implementation of the recently published U.S. National Defense
Strategy. In this context, it **[is of vital importance to the United
States that its defense and security relationship with European
countries, especially within NATO, not only remains healthy but is
correctly oriented to current and likely future
challenges.]{.underline}** The U.S. Priority: China A war between China
and the United States is not inevitable, but **[the next 15 years could
see the eruption of]{.underline}** such a **[conflict]{.underline}**.
While this may not reach the threshold of full-scale war or a nuclear
conflict, **[the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have set
their country on a trajectory that will lead to]{.underline}** a
strategic situation that may result in s**[ustained armed conflict,
potentially stretching across the Pacific region, in all
domains.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the **[combination of China's huge
population, export-oriented economy, and lack of natural
resources]{.underline}** could **[generate an inexorable push towards
conflict.]{.underline}** **[The CCP leadership has emphasized the
development of military capabilities that could deny the U.S. Navy
access to the South China Sea, including long-range air and missile
defense and anti-ship capabilities.]{.underline}** This anti-access area
denial (A2AD) capability does not depend on a large Chinese navy but
instead uses well-protected, land-based systems. **[The creation of
artificial islands in the region, most of which are already being armed
and garrisoned with A2AD capabilities, are violations of international
law and agreements that clearly demonstrate the CCP's strategy and
intentions.]{.underline}** Enforcement of freedom of the seas and
recognized international waters by the United States and others is
necessary to counter these policies. In one recent demonstration of CCP
intent, there was a near-collision incident between Chinese and U.S.
Navy ships, caused by unsafe and unprofessional behavior by the Chinese
one. Statements by the China's minister of defense during his recent
visit to the Pentagon, including demands that the U.S. forces stay away
from the articifial islands, indicate that his country will continue to
push aggressively its territorial claims. Meanwhile, **[in Europe China
has become an increasingly significant and potentially divisive
influence in a variety of aspects; especially in infrastructure,
technology transfer, and trade. The Belt and Road Initiative has
resulted in dramatic increases in Chinese investment in Europe, control
of hundreds of European companies, and ownership or control of more than
10 percent of Europe's ports]{.underline}**. These developments, and the
CCP's strategy and behavior, are **[cause for concern about the
potential for conflict with China within the next 15
years.]{.underline}** They also show why **[the United States must
prepare for this eventuality.]{.underline}** During the Cold War, the
United States used a "two and a half wars" framework for force
structure. This was not a strategy, but rather a mechanism meant to
assess how much capability and capacity its armed forces needed to deter
effectively and, if necessary, win simultaneous conflicts in two
different operational theaters and "hold" in a third, minor theater at
the same time, for as long as necessary. Today, and for the foreseeable
future, the United States can no longer exercise this capability and
capacity. Therefore, **[in the event of conflict with China, it will
need a strong, cohesive NATO as well as partnerships around the world in
order to continue deterring a revanchist Russia and to carry on
counter-terrorism operations in the Middle East while the majority of
U.S. forces and capabilities are operating in the
Pacific.]{.underline}** The U.S. Commitment to Europe Many **[European
leaders have expressed uncertainty about the United States' commitment
to Europe]{.underline}**, based on **[President Barack Obama's "pivot to
the Pacific"]{.underline}** and, more recently, President Donald
**[Trump's questioning of the relevance and value of NATO and the
EU]{.underline}**. The facts on the ground, however, demonstrate that
the United States, including the current administration, is fully
committed to its long-time allies and partners in Europe. Everything
promised by the Obama administration at the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw
is being delivered by the Trump administration: a rotational armored
brigade combat team, pre-positioned equipment for an army armored
division, and the Enhanced Forward Presence battle group in Poland. The
administration just announced an additional 1,500 soldiers in an
artillery brigade and short-range air defense battalion that will be
assigned to Europe. The operational contingency fund, known as the
European Reassurance Initiative, which started during the Obama
administration, has increased steadily over the last three years and is
now known as the European Deterrence Initiative, reflecting U.S. backing
for Europe and deterrence of Russia. Also telling was the Senate vote
just prior to this year's NATO's summit in Brussels, which affirmed by a
98:2 margin U.S. support for Article 5. The United States' commitment to
European partners like Ukraine and Georgia also remains very strong, as
evidenced by provision of the Javelin anti-tank weapon system, other
equipment, and training, as well as continued support for these
countries' eventual membership in NATO and the return of their
territories from Russia.

healthy]{.underline}** [but is **correctly oriented**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} current and likely future [challenges]{.underline}.

Several things remain to be achieved if Europe and the United States in
this regard. First, they must build a common approach not only in
defense, but across economic, information, and political domains.
Second, they must solve the continued inequity in burden sharing that
hinders a stronger relationship between them and erodes the confidence
of many Americans in the efficacy of NATO. Third, it is necessary to
achieve greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the
Black Sea region. Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve its
deterrence capability against Russia's aggressive behavior.

The [interests and responsibilities of the]{.underline}

**[global]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} **[freedom of

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Baltics/Arctic

#### Solves war in Baltic Seas, North Atlantic, and Arctic.

"Cohesion in the EU and Nato will keep the peace in Baltic Sea,"
Frivarld,
https://frivarld.se/sakerhetsradet/cohesion-in-eu-and-nato-will-keep-the-peace-in-baltic-sea/micahw

I would argue that [in the situation we now are in]{.underline}, [in the
Baltic Sea Region]{.underline}, **[cohesion]{.underline}** in the EU and
[in]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** [is the]{.underline} **[most
important challenge]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[stronger]{.underline}** [the confidence in the cohesion
of]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[lower]{.underline}** [the likelihood of military use]{.underline} of
force [in the Baltic Sea region]{.underline}.

Each state is first and foremost dependent on its own will and ability
to assert its security. But [all states depend on]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [with others]{.underline}, [**especially**
in the case of a potential conflict with]{.underline} a country like
**[Russia]{.underline}**. This also applies to the militarily
non-aligned states Finland and Sweden.

Sweden and Finland are now preparing for being able to give and receive
support in crises, from each other, "beyond peace". No other partnership
than that of Finland or Sweden has closer cooperation with NATO. The two
non-aligned states also have special cooperation agreements with the
United States and are increasingly participating in increasingly
large-scale exercises with the NATO states.

[During]{.underline} President **[Trump's]{.underline}** [four
years]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[transatlantic
link]{.underline}** [has been]{.underline} **[weakened]{.underline}**.
We have had a situation where [not only]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** [but
also the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
have [sought to]{.underline} **[divide]{.underline}** EU and [NATO
member states]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline} **[good
hope]{.underline}** [that the link will be]{.underline}
**[strengthened]{.underline}** again [under]{.underline} President
**[Biden]{.underline}**.

The transatlantic link is important. [Security in the **Baltic
Sea**]{.underline} region [and the situation in the **North Atlantic**
and the **Arctic** are]{.underline} **[closely linked]{.underline}**.
And vice versa. One challenge is to build transatlantic cooperation
strong regardless of whoever is president of the United States. This
means that [European states need to take]{.underline} **[greater
responsibility]{.underline}** [for the strength of the transatlantic
link]{.underline}. The US, independently of the president, is said to
have increased its focus on the Pacific. But the US will still be
important for security in the Baltic Sea Region.

Unfortunately, [the]{.underline} **[cohesion]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}** [is not as strong as
it should be in order to take greater responsibility for the
transatlantic link]{.underline}. The situation is perhaps most difficult
in the eastern Mediterranean. It is actually in the neighborhood of the
Baltic Sea region. Already the Crimean War in the 1850s showed this.

In the EU, the challenge is to defend the Union as a community of values
​​and at the same time develop a real capacity to act as a foreign and
security policy actor -- especially in the geographical proximity of the
Union.

[The situation is]{.underline} **[not at all hopeless]{.underline}** --
but it is demanding. EU and [NATO members]{.underline}, as well as NATO
partners, [in the Baltic Sea Region have **every reason**]{.underline}
[to contribute to a]{.underline} **[strong transatlantic
link]{.underline}** and to strong cohesion [between member states in
Europe]{.underline}.

Inevitably, [the security situation in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}
Region [and in its immediate neighborhood is]{.underline} **[most
important]{.underline}**, especially with regard to defense policy. The
[lack of cohesion]{.underline} in a larger context **[only
underlines]{.underline}** [this relationship]{.underline}.

Most Likely To Begin", July 20^th^,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044>\]

While **[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapons could potentially be [use]{.mark}d in
any number of future warfighting scenarios, there are multiple reasons
to suspect that [the greatest danger]{.mark} exists with regard to
[the]{.mark} three [Baltic s]{.mark}tates. Here are eight of those
reasons]{.underline}**.

First, both **[[Washington and Moscow assign high strategic
significance]{.mark} to the future disposition of the Baltic
states]{.underline}**. **[From Moscow\'s perspective, the three states
are located close to the centers of Russian political and military
power, and therefore are a potential base for devastating
attacks]{.underline}**. For instance, the distance between Lithuania\'s
capital of Vilnius and Moscow is less than 500 miles \-- a short trip
for a supersonic aircraft. **[From Washington\'s perspective, failure to
protect the Baltic states from Russian aggression could lead to the
unraveling of America\'s most important alliance]{.underline}**.

Second, **[[Washington has been]{.mark} very [public about]{.mark} it
[commitment]{.mark} to the Baltic states]{.underline}**. For instance,
**[in 2014 President Obama stated during a visit to Estonia that defense
of the three countries\' capitals was \"just as important as the defense
of Berlin and Paris and London]{.underline}**.\" That is an
extraordinary assertion considering that the population of metropolitan
London (about 8 million) is greater than that of all three Baltic states
combined (about 6 million), and that the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea
is so close to the Russian heartland.

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Deterrence

#### Strict capabilities aren't enough for COMPLETE Russian deterrence \-\-- Russia can collapse deterrence by creating openings in NATO disagreements \-\-- Cohesion is the only way to ensure Deterrence

Chart removed for brevity The direct comparison between the **[military
capabilities of Russia and NATO]{.underline}** indicates that there
**[is no real threat in terms of quantitative or qualitative advantage
in Russia's favour.]{.underline}** On the contrary, **[NATO is in the
lead]{.underline}**, **[with a huge advantage]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** both **[equipment and personnel]{.underline}**
**[as well as tech]{.underline}**nology, **[quality and
quantity]{.underline}**. **[However, there are areas in favour of
Russia]{.underline}**. These include **[WRE]{.underline}**
(radio-electronic warfare), **[aviation and air defence capabilities,
radar systems]{.underline}** as well as nuclear carriers and weapons.
Needless to mention other types of mass destruction weapons which,
according to the International Humanitarian Law of Armed Conflict (IHL),
ought to cease to exist, whereas Russia is highly likely to possess them
(chemical weapons were used in counter-terrorism operations and special
combat operations). Over the past two decades, **[the Russian defence
industry has developed, researched and introduced dozens of
radio-electronic warfare systems capable of disrupting and completely
immobilizing most of the forces in the area]{.underline}**s of land, air
and water. Russian technologies are effective at fighting aircrafts,
cruise missiles, radars, conventional missiles and unmanned aircrafts.
The latest implemented system is the Palantin system, which has been
deployed in the Kaliningrad Oblast and Crimea. This system is able to
disrupt the operation of AWACS at a distance of 250 km. Probably, it is
also able to disrupt all radio, GPS and mobile systems as well as create
the so-called apparent targets that mask the correct flight paths of
projectiles fired from the Iskander launcher. Thus, combating and
destroying Iskander missiles have become even more difficult. Moreover,
the system also functions as a reconnaissance platform (Cranny-Evans
2019; Hodges et al. 2019). The deployment of Iskander and Krasucha
(Gawęda 2015), as well as Palantin and aeronautical defence systems in
the Kaliningrad Oblast and Crimea, including the S-300 and S-400, create
strong Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) nodes with the simultaneous
capability to strike by means of airborne and land forces within the
depth of their practical impact range (A2/AD nodes). Another threat
worth noting, **[particularly important for NATO Eastern Wall states, is
Russia's conduct of operations which cannot be immediately repelled by
the Alliance due to their little scale]{.underline}**. **[They take
place in the form of quick, limited or offensive operations giving
Russia the advantage of "facts made"]{.underline}** and allowing it to
join into the peace talks from that position. Figure 4 presents the
summary of the estimated military capabilities, presented earlier in
individual innovation trends, of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces
in Europe at the end of 2019. It illustrates the deployment of the
Strategic Connected Commands, the army and corpses as well as
"inaccessible areas" and potential targets to be attacked in the event
of a conflict (air bases, airports and radar systems). It is worth
noting that almost the entire area of Poland is an anti-access zone
(A2/AD) (Gawęda 2018), which means that **[any allied defence support
from the air, at least in the first phase of a conflict, will be very
difficult.]{.underline}** Operations of the Polish aviation and
capability to command them also seem highly problematic. Unfortunately,
that confirms the likelihood of limited offensive capabilities as
described above. \*\*Chart removed\*\* **[Russia's significant asset
is]{.underline}** also the fact **[that it constitutes a single entity
in contrast to NATO]{.underline}** whose forces, which guarantee the
security of Central and Eastern European states, are distributed
throughout the world (including the US and Canada). **[Thus, the
distance gives Russia a big advantage]{.underline}**. The **[USA, being
the major pillar of NATO, have several sensitive security spots and,
therefore, have to operate on many levels]{.underline}**, not just
watching over their own national and NATO's interests, but also, in
particular, European states neighbouring with Russia. Moreover, **[the
distance and response time create problems, while Russia has the freedom
to choose the time and space to provoke and attack]{.underline}**.
**[However, it is not the military threat that is the most dangerous for
NATO]{.underline}**. **[The main threat are the attempts made by Russia
to bring individual member states into conflict with each other in order
to break down NATO's cohesion]{.underline}**. **[Success of such
attempts could create a space for Russia to undertake possible military
actions]{.underline}**. The tools provided by the supplemented Gerasimov
doctrine entitle Russia to use all methods and measures of combat such
as: pre-emptive attacks, impacts on civilians and administration centres
(psychological and information operations), as well as the use of
nuclear weapons. In other terms, it entitles Russia to wage a total war
at a convenient time and place.

Summing up the provisions of the consecutive **[[NATO
Summits]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the declarations in Brussels of 2018,
it can be concluded that they **[[were crucial to the strategy pursued
by NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** nowadays. **[[The Alliance's new command
structure has become more suited for undertaking effective joint defence
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Definitely, assessing the consecutive
provisions, it can be stated that by introducing the standby initiative,
**[[NATO has become capable of putting into operation a greater number
of troops almost instantaneously.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[The
Alliance's forward-looking presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Central
and Eastern Europe **[[has also been modified, which should translate
into a major increase in the Alliance's defence
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the event of potential enemy
aggression (Graf 2018). The most recent **[[NATO
Summit]{.underline}]{.mark}** in London of December 2019 **[[reaffirmed
the Alliance's unity and commitment to Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the Washington Treaty stating that an attack on one ally would be
considered an attack on all. "In difficult times, we are stronger as an
Alliance, and our citizens are safer. Our bond and mutual commitment
guarantee our freedoms, our values and our security for 70 years to
come. We are working to ensure that NATO guarantees these freedoms,
values and security for future generations".---The Alliance's
declaration proclaims.Footnote17 The leaders reaffirmed that NATO
guarantees security and fundamental human rights as well as the rule of
law on the territory of the Member States for the people living there.
"**[[Solidarity, unity and cohesion are the fundamental principles of
our Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[As we are working together to
prevent conflicts and preserve peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, NATO
remains the foundation of our collective defence and the basic forum for
consultation and security decisions among the allies. We reaffirm the
lasting transatlantic relationship between Europe and North America, the
observance of the objectives and principles of the United Nations
Charter and our solemn commitment as set out in Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty that an attack on one Ally will be considered an
attack on all of us"---they reaffirmed in the declaration. Most
importantly for Poland and the Baltic states, **[[NATO leaders agreed on
the updated defence plans for Poland and the Member
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They also expressed their criticism of
Russia's aggressive actions (Gotkowska and Szymański 2017).Footnote18

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Taiwan War

#### NATO cohesion spurred by Ukraine and Russia prevents Chinese invasion of Taiwan

(John, "China Is Learning Lessons From West\'s United Response to
Russia," pg online @
<https://www.newsweek.com/china-learning-lessons-wests-united-response-russia-ukraine-invasion-1686259>
//um-ef)

**[[China is watching the West]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'s collective
response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is **[[learning lessons that]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[may change
its]{.underline}]{.mark}** own **[[calculations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[it seeks to annex
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to senior officials in
Washington and London. When the threat of economic sanctions failed to
deter Vladimir Putin and the first of Russia\'s 150,000 troops began
pouring into Ukrainian territory on February 24, Taiwan became a
trending topic as **[[observers feared]{.underline}]{.mark}** China\'s
President **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping **[[would be emboldened
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** make good on his vow to **[[capture
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** democratic **[[island]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of 23.5 million people. However, as Putin\'s forces failed to achieve
their blitzkrieg goals and the war entered its second week, the thinking
changed. Ukraine\'s leaders remained in Kyiv; its armed forces fought
back and ordinary civilians joined the resistance. **[[A galvanized
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the early effects of the West\'s
unprecedented punishment on Russia\'s economy began to **[[give China
watchers pause]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taiwan\'s Foreign Minister Joseph
Wu called the Ukrainian resistance an inspiration for the Taiwanese
people. Taipei joined several Asian governments in imposing export
controls on Russia and landed on Moscow\'s list of \"unfriendly\"
countries this week. Russia\'s forces continue their march toward
Ukraine\'s capital and may eventually achieve their military objectives
even as political goals---regime change and the submission of its
public---remain out of reach. But the events of the past days have
already made China more reluctant to invade Taiwan than just several
months ago, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told
the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. \"The view is both that
**[[it is likely to reinforce China\'s perspective on the seriousness
with which we would approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** an infringement on
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and in the unity that they\'ve
seen between Europe and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, particularly in enacting sanctions,\"
she said. \"Not just that unity, but the impact of those sanctions I
think are both things that are critical to their calculus and something
that will be interesting for us to see how they learn those lessons.\"
In her opening remarks, Haines said
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**---\"an unparalleled
priority\"---**[[would prefer \"coerced unification that avoids armed
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" The Chinese government has been
working to isolate Taiwan and undermine its elected leaders for years,
she said. \"At the same time, Beijing is preparing to use military force
if it decides this is necessary.\" In answer to a similar question, CIA
Director William Burns said he \"would not underestimate President Xi
and the Chinese leadership\'s determination with regard to Taiwan.\"
However, Burns said **[[Beijing has been \"surprised and unsettled\"
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[Russians]{.underline}]{.mark}** have **[[encountered in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"Everything **[[from the strength of
the Western reaction,]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the way in which
Ukrainians have fiercely resisted,\" he said. \"I think **[[there\'s an
impact on the Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** calculus **[[with regard to
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who heads the
Pentagon\'s Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers at the
Russia-focused hearing that Taiwan and Ukraine were \"two different
things completely.\" He then hinted at the considerable U.S. military
presence in Asia. \"I also believe that our deterrence posture in the
Pacific puts a very different perspective on all of this,\" said
Berrier. \"We do know that \[**[[China\] is watching very, very
carefully]{.underline}]{.mark}** what happens and how this plays out.\"
At a similar briefing of the U.K.\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee on
Monday, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Beijing \"does not want
to associate too closely\" with Russia\'s new status as a \"global
pariah.\" She left little doubt that **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
**[[set]{.underline}]{.mark}**ting **[[a precedent with its united
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[sending a message to
China]{.underline}** in the process. \"There\'s also the issue of the
importance of showing strength as NATO,\" Truss said, \"because **[[the
rest of the world will be watching,]{.underline}]{.mark}** including
China, on how **[[the West]{.underline}]{.mark}** continues to
respond.\" \"Of course, **[[if we see a weak
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[that is likely to embolden
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So I see a tough policy on Russia and a
tough policy on China as being complementary,\" she said.

#### US-China nuclear war over Taiwan likely and causes extinction -- deterrence and no first use don't apply

Taiwan and the Prospects for War Between China and America, The
Diplomat,
http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/taiwan-and-the-prospects-for-war-between-china-and-america/)

For the United States and its allies and partners in Asia, **[[China's
aggressive efforts]{.mark} to assert questionable claims in the South
and East China Sea, enforce a disputed Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ), build the rocket/missile and naval [capabilities]{.mark} needed
[to invade Taiwan,]{.mark} and build a substantial ballistic missile
capability all work to create a situation where conflict between the
U.S. and the PRC could occur and [rapidly escalate]{.mark}. Given that
American political and military leaders have a poor understanding of
Chinese ambitions and]{.underline}** particularly their opaque
**[nuclear thinking]{.underline}**, there is ample reason to be
concerned that **[a future conflict could escalate to a limited nuclear
conflict]{.underline}**. Thus, it is worth taking a look at the PRC with
an eye toward offering insight into Chinese motivation and thinking when
it comes to how a possible **[[crisis over Taiwan]{.mark} could
[escalate to]{.mark} the use of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Chinese Capabilities In their latest estimate, Hans M. Kristensen and
Robert S. Norris assess that the Second Artillery Corps possesses forty
long-range nuclear missiles that can strike the United States if fired
from China's eastern seaboard and an additional twenty that could hit
Hawaii and Alaska. The challenge for China, is reaching the East Coast
-- home to the nation's capital and largest economic centers. To
overcome this challenge China is also developing its JL-2
submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which is a sea-based variant
of the DF-31 land-mobile long-range missile that will go to sea on
Jin-class submarines. China may also be developing a new mobile missile,
the DF-41, which will carry multiple warheads, giving the Chinese a way
to potentially defeat an American ballistic missile defense system. It
is worth noting that the quantity, though not the quality, of China's
nuclear arsenal is only limited by its dwindling stock of weapons grade
plutonium. This raises the question; to what end is China developing and
deploying its nuclear arsenal? Chinese Motivation The textbook answer is
straightforward. China seeks a secure second (retaliatory) strike
capability that will serve to deter an American first strike. As China
argues, it has a "no-nuclear-first policy" which makes its arsenal
purely defensive -- while its other capabilities such as cyber are
offensive. Potential nuclear adversaries including Russia, India, and
the United States are fully aware that China's investment in advanced
warheads and ballistic missile delivery systems bring Delhi, Moscow,
and, soon, Washington within reach of the "East Wind." While not a
nuclear peer competitor to either Russia or the U.S., China is rapidly
catching up as it builds an estimated 30-50 new nuclear warheads each
year. While American leaders may find such a sentiment unfounded, the
**[[PRC has a strong fear that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[will use its nuclear arsenal as a
tool to]{.underline}**]{.mark} blackmail [(**[coerce)
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[into taking or not taking a number of
actions that are against its interests. China's fears are not unfounded.
Unlike China]{.underline}**, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[maintains an ambiguous use-policy in order
to provide maximum flexibility.]{.underline}** As declassified
government documents from the 1970s clearly show, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates certainly **[planned
to use overwhelming nuclear force early in a European conflict with the
Soviet Union]{.underline}**. Given American nuclear superiority and its
positioning of ballistic missile defenses in Asia, ostensibly to defend
against a North Korean attack, **[China sees its position and ability to
deter the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as
vulnerable]{.underline}**. Possible Scenario While there are several
scenarios where conflict between the United States and China is
possible, some analysts believe that a **[[conflict over Taiwan remains
the most likely place where the PRC and the U.S. would come to
blows]{.mark}. Beijing is aware that any coercive action on its part to
force Taiwan to accept its political domination could incur the wrath of
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. **[To prevent the
U.S. from intervening in the region, China will]{.underline}** certainly
turn to its anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) **[strategy]{.underline}**,
beginning with non-lethal means and non-lethal threats **[to
discourage]{.underline}** the **[American public from supporting the use
of force in support of Taiwan]{.underline}**. If thwarted in its initial
efforts to stop Chinese aggression against Taiwan, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[may be tempted to
resort to stronger measures and attack mainland China. A [kinetic
response to a cyber-attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example, although
an option, **[would very likely [lead to escalation]{.mark} on the part
of the Chinese. Given the regime's relative weakness and the probability
that American attacks]{.underline}** (cyber and conventional) **[on
China will include strikes against PLA command and
control]{.underline}** (C2) **[nodes]{.underline}**, which mingle
conventional and nuclear C2, the **[Chinese may escalate [to]{.mark} the
[use of a nuclear weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** (against a U.S. carrier
in China's self-declared waters for example) **[as a means of forcing
de-escalation]{.underline}**. In the view of China, **[[such a strike
would not be a violation of its no-first-use policy because the strike
would occur in sovereign Chinese waters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus
**[making the use of nuclear weapons a defensive act. [Since Taiwan is a
domestic matter,]{.mark} any [U.S. intervention would be]{.mark} viewed
as [an act of aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This, in the minds of
the Chinese, makes the United States an outside aggressor, not China. It
is also important to remember that nuclear weapons are an asymmetric
response to American conventional superiority. **[Given that China is
incapable of executing and sustaining a conventional military campaign
against the continental U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
**[China would clearly have an asymmetry of interest and capability with
the United States -- far more is at stake for China than]{.underline}**
it is **[for]{.underline}** the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. In essence, **[the only effective option in
retaliation for a successful U.S. conventional campaign on Chinese soil
is the nuclear one]{.underline}**. Without making too crude a point, the
nuclear option provides more bang for the buck, or yuan. **[Given that
mutually assured destruction]{.underline}** **[[(MAD) is not part of
China's strategic thinking]{.mark} -- in fact it is explicitly rejected
-- the PRC will see the situation very differently than the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

## Euro War Impacts 

### Impacts \-\-- Euro/Russia War Escalates

#### WWIII 

Adrian **Bonenberger 17**, Vocativ Staff, Where Could The European Cold
War Go Hot Again? Think a war in Europe won\'t happen? Here\'s a look at
the issues most likely to spur a military confrontation, 1-27-17,
<http://www.vocativ.com/397190/europe-cold-war-military-conflict/>

Since 2014, however, and the West's failure to protect an avowedly
pro-European Ukraine, it has become increasingly popular to describe the
West's relationship with Russia as a new Cold War. Reading the
headlines, it certainly seems like **[Moscow]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[Europe]{.underline}** **[are one badly-aimed
missile]{.underline}** or bomb **[away from World War
III.]{.underline}** As political realities in the US and abroad are
challenged, what are the lines or issues most likely to lead to war in
Europe? Imperial Russia By A Different Name One variable that seems
constant right now is Russia. Whether one sees things from Russia's
perspective (wherein Russia is surrounded by hostile neighbors intent on
its destruction) or those of its nearest neighbors (which see Russia as
an aggressive and expansive imperial bully), Russia's actions are
indisputable. It has invaded and occupied portions of Ukraine and
Georgia. It has countenanced cyberattacks on Estonia, Ukraine (which
included the first deaths attached to cyberwarfare), the U.S., Georgia,
Azerbaijan and NATO. It is pursuing a long game to undermine and
destabilize any and all political alliances that do not include it, as
well as those that do include it. The weaker everyone else is, the
greater the room for Russian opportunism. Russia has also taken the side
of America's primary antagonists in the Middle East. This has made it
the friend of isolationists, nationalists, and left-wingers who
(paradoxically, given Russia's own actions) oppose an American and
European hegemony, backed by the increasingly questionable threat of
military intervention. Whether it is lashing out in righteous
self-defense or as part of an unethical attempt to grow larger and more
powerful at the expense of its smaller and weaker neighbors, there is no
question that Russia is looking to expand its brand. The Return Of
Nationalism **[Across Europe]{.underline}**, explicit **[nationalism is
on the rise]{.underline}** at levels unseen since the early 20th
century. While hard to quantify, the success of so-called
"**[populist]{.underline}**" political **[parties with]{.underline}**
**[nationalist agendas]{.underline}** **[suggests]{.underline}** **[a
growing dissatisfaction]{.underline}** with NATO, the EU, and the U.S..
Over the last two years, far-right parties have won political power,
gained credibility, or advanced substantial nationalist agendas in
Poland (Law and Justice), Hungary (Jobbik), Romania (the recent founding
of a new nationalist party) Austria, Italy (rejection of judicial and
legal reform), the U.S. (Trump/Alt-Right), Germany (Alternative for
Germany), UK (Brexit), France (Le Pen's National Front) and others.
**[Nationalism overlaps]{.underline}** well **[with]{.underline}**
**[Russia's agenda]{.underline}**, because it erodes federalism---the
idea that different people in different countries could lay aside tribal
instincts like linguistic or ethnic affinities to cooperate. **[This
makes it easier for Russia to project power]{.underline}** at a local or
regional level without sacrificing much in the way of money or manpower.
Even nationalists like those in Poland and Germany who tend to dislike
Russians for a variety of actual and perceived historical slights seem
to receive financial support from Russia. This seems based on the
principle that a Europe of many countries will be less unified in
opposing Russia's agenda. In principle, those countries that have a
strong nationalist political voice end up pursuing policies that
strengthen (relatively) Russia. For people who believe that NATO, the
U.S., or the EU are too strong, that may not be a particularly
troublesome issue. Immigration There are at least three different types
of national responses to the question of (largely Middle Eastern and
African) immigration into Europe. The first draws on 20th century legal
precedents guaranteeing humans fair and dignified treatment regardless
of their national background. This response, exemplified by Germans and
Scandinavians, tends to view immigrants as refugees fleeing war or
economic oppression for which Europe or the West have some kind of
responsibility given the global economy. Nations like Germany, Denmark
and Sweden are considered among the most generous to refugees. Germany
especially has embraced modern attitudes toward immigration, in the wake
of its catastrophic spasm of ethnic cleansing during WWII. Other
countries with colonial legacies have maintained generous post-colonial
policies. Absent active restitution, countries like France, the UK,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Portugal---any country that
had its finger in the exploitative pie that was 17th-20th century
Africa, South America, and Asia---provide expedited or dual-citizenship
options for many people living in countries formerly touched by European
sails and soldiers. This is similar to the posture of countries like
Germany. It also results in specific ethnic and religious traffic
flowing from the formerly colonized to the colonizer. A critical
difference between the experience of countries like Germany and those
like France or the UK (for example) is that Germany's posture toward
immigration and citizenship embraces an assumed modern, cosmopolitan
future, and exists without any natural enemies safe for the white
supremacists and Neo-Nazis who nearly destroyed Europe during World War
II (until recently, not a credible source of dissidence). Colonialism
did not die easily in the UK, France, or other similar countries, and
much military blood and cash was expended in attempting to keep colonial
holdings within the fold. Groups nostalgic for former imperial glory
tend to see immigration as an affront to national dignity, beyond being
unwise policy. Groups that evaluate immigration through the lens of
colonial nostalgia are not Nazis or necessarily white supremacists,
though the practical implications of their attitudes end up being
similar enough to warrant comparison. Finally, there are nations in
Central and Eastern Europe whose attitudes on immigration were shaped by
their experiences in WWI and WWII, as well as life behind the Iron
Curtain. Ethnic cleansing and population movements by the Nazis and the
Kremlin-led USSR left countries with the idea that ethnic homogeneity
was an absolute good, and ethnic diversity was an existential threat.
During the first part of its life, the USSR viewed ethnicity as
threatening to the ideal of a classless society, although that slowly
devolved into a view that non-Russian ethnicities were dangerous. This
is not to diminish or excuse a powerful racial element in resistance to
immigration, simply to frame it in the context of places that
experienced the Holocaust firsthand, often actively participating in it
in a way that ended up shaping every subsequent generation. Religion The
European immigration "crisis" is complicated by the issue of religion.
There are two key fault lines at play here: Orthodox versus
non-Orthodox, and Christian versus Islam. Countries like Germany,
Hungary, Croatia, Poland and Slovakia tend to be Catholic. The primary
factor in considering their political preferences is their experience
with Soviet-style governance, wherein Orthodox Christianity was a proxy
for Russian intelligence agencies, and Catholicism was part of
resistance to totalitarianism and Russian nationalism. Orthodox
countries tend to be pro-Russian: Greece, Bulgaria Macedonia and Serbia
all share religious and cultural affinity for one another, as well as
Russia. They tend to be hostile to the idea of immigration from the
Middle East and Africa based on religious grounds, given the
relationship between church and state. This has been the case for
centuries. Religious constituencies within all European countries tend
to view the EU's stance toward religion with skepticism, and see efforts
to resettle non-Christians within their borders as direct attacks on
both their Christianity and ethnicity. Still, there are substantial
differences between Orthodox countries (which tend to be pro-Russian)
and Catholic countries that spent time behind the Iron Curtain (which
tend to be anti-Russian). Countries Formerly Occupied Or Annexed By
Russia Polish voters empowered the "Law and Order" party based partly on
its promises to block non-Christian (most importantly, Islamic)
immigration and the expansion of EU power at the expense of Polish
autonomy. At the same time, Poland is among the most staunch and
enthusiastic NATO member-states. Its army is the fourth largest in
Europe behind Russia, Ukraine, and France. Its chief foreign policy
priorities have nothing to do with Middle Eastern immigration, and
everything to do with preventing a repeat of the 20th century, where
Poland was occupied by Russian soldiers on three separate occasions, and
forced to adopt Soviet governance at bayonet-point. Similar in their
opposition to recent Russian militancy to Poland are the Baltic States,
as well as countries like Sweden, Finland, and Romania. The fate of the
Baltics and Finland were determined as part of agreements between Nazi
Germany and the USSR to enforce German and Russian "spheres of
influence" according to Hitler and Stalin's vision for Europe. The
Baltics were made into independent SSRs within the USSR, while Sweden
maintained its independence. Finland was invaded and had large portions
of territory annexed into Russia, and Romania was partitioned before and
after WWII, first by agreement between the USSR and the Nazis, and later
by conquest. Within the Baltics, anti-Russian attitudes are tempered by
former Russian citizens of the USSR who lost their national standing
when the USSR collapsed. This is most conspicuous in Latvia, but is also
true for Lithuania and Estonia. Broadly speaking, any country with an
ethnic or Russian-speaking population that borders Russia or was part of
the USSR's sphere of influence. It is a visible reminder of Russia's de
facto colonization of other nations within the USSR, the consequences of
which---the current war in Ukraine, as well as the past war in
Georgia---explain why national security is among the most urgent
priorities for these countries now (satirically represented here, though
more recent developments suggest that Germany would remain part of the
EU and France perhaps would not). Another way of stating this European
dynamic would be thus: countries with no direct experience of the USSR
tend not to see Russia as an imminent military threat. Those with direct
experience of the USSR (and which therefore have vocal Russian-speaking
minorities as viable political entities) see Russia as an existential
threat. Economic Ideals Those **[countries that have had difficulty
adjusting]{.underline}** their **[economies]{.underline}** to meet the
EU's standards, **[or]{.underline}** which **[have not
prospered]{.underline}** during their time in the EU
**[have]{.underline}** **[become]{.underline}** powerful passive
**[allies of]{.underline}** **[Russia]{.underline}**.
**[Greece]{.underline}**, **[Italy]{.underline}**,
**[Spain]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[Bulgaria]{.underline}**
have all **[come to view sanctions on Russia as damaging]{.underline}**
**[to their]{.underline}** own **[economies]{.underline}**. **[They view
competition]{.underline}** with Russia **[as harmful to their
economic]{.underline}** **[interests]{.underline}**, either "someone
else's problem" or somehow the fault of the U.S.. The EU's structure
(exposed during Greece's economic crisis of 2012) does not privilege
every country equally, nor is it designed to---its design offers
benefits to those countries that are best able to leverage Europe's many
markets and industries. Those in favor of the EU would stress that each
country that joined the EU did so transparently and freely, and expected
to benefit from its structure by investing time and energy---these
**[people]{.underline}** would **[say that countries failing
to]{.underline}** **[maximize]{.underline}** their **[income within the
EU have themselves to blame]{.underline}**. **[Those opposed to the
EU]{.underline}** (many Greek nationalists) **[believe that it is an
exploitative system.]{.underline}** Energy Dependence The final factor
that determines a country's relationship with Europe versus Russia is
its dependence on Russian oil and gas. After the fall of the USSR, some
countries that had existed behind the Iron Curtain were able to maintain
privileged relationships with Russian energy producers. Dependence on
the Russia used to be the single greatest European weakness, and still
is for certain countries (most conspicuously Hungary, which goes out of
its way to propitiate Russia, but also other Central European powers as
well as Ukraine itself). Lately, though, low oil prices, longtime pushes
for energy independence using renewable sources, as well as the opening
of alternate energy markets in the Middle East have made it increasingly
difficult for Russia to monopolize Europe's energy, and therefore have
reduced its political influence there. This places Russia in a serious
bind, as the US's development of new technology to access additional
energy reserves means that as the price of oil and gas rises, it becomes
profitable for it to reenter the energy market---meaning European
countries will never again be entirely dependent on Russia for energy.
**[The Prospect of War]{.underline}** Although there are many fault
lines that could lead to conflict, it still seems unlikely that European
war will spread west from Ukraine. Still, **[it's]{.underline}**
**[worth paying attention to]{.underline}** these various
**[collisions]{.underline}** **[between]{.underline}** **[Russian and
European countries]{.underline}**. No **[century in history has seen a
Europe free from war]{.underline}**---**[the question is always one of
degree]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[intensity]{.underline}**.
So far, **[the 21st century]{.underline}** still **[has all
the]{.underline}** **[elements in place for]{.underline}** a truly
**[epic struggle]{.underline}** **[between European countries and
Russia]{.underline}**. And **[this conflict,]{.underline}** unlike those
of the last century, **[may be adjudicated by nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**.

Escalation of War (15)

Increasing, enlarging, or intensifying the nature, magnitude, or
parameters of a war. Escalation may entail an increase in troops,
additional third party involvement, the use of deadlier weapons, or a
change in political or military objectives. Escalation may be likened to
a ladder, in that the level of coercion and force tends to increase as
the war becomes more costly and uncertain. In a limited war, states can
employ sundry military measures to challenge one another's resolve and
capabilities. in such conflicts, the goal of escalation may be to defeat
or force the surrender of an adversary, or to mete out increased
punishment to pressure a foe to negotiate or terminate the action that
originally precipitated the conflict. **[In a limited war, military
objectives]{.underline}** tend to **[escalate rapidly. [In a nuclear
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, the stakes are far
greater---**[[rapid escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** must be avoided,
as it **[[could spell instant]{.underline}]{.mark}** disaster or
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a nuclear age, most experts
believe there is no such thing as a "limited" nuclear war. For
example**[, [if one side initiated]{.mark} a [war in Europe]{.mark},
even with conventional weapons, it is highly likely that [it would

If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did not exist today,
the United States would not seek to create it. In 1949, it made sense in
the face of a potential Soviet invasion to forge a bond in the North
Atlantic area among the United States, Canada, and the west European
states. Today, if the United States were starting from scratch in a
world of transnational threats, the **[debate]{.underline}** would be
**[over whether to follow liberal and neoconservative calls for an
alliance of democracies]{.underline}** without regard to geography or to
develop a great power concert envisioned by the realists to uphold the
current order. The United States is not, however, starting from scratch,
and **[NATO should not disappear. While the bonds across the Atlantic
may be frayed]{.underline}**, **[they are stronger than those tying the
United States to other parts of the world. Common history and values
matter]{.underline}**, as do the resources (both financial and military)
that Europe possesses. The **[NATO allies share a common interest in
preventing disruptions to the global economy]{.underline}**,
**[including attacks on freedom of navigation. As a community of
democracies]{.underline}**, the member states are **[threatened by
forces such as Islamic extremism and]{.underline}** the **[rise of
authoritarian states]{.underline}**. For the United States, **[the
alliance is a source of legitimacy for]{.underline}** actions in places
like Afghanistan. For Europe, **[NATO is a vehicle for projecting hard
power]{.underline}**. While **[NATO]{.underline}** alone cannot defend
against the range of threats facing the member states, it **[can serve
as the hub for American and European leaders to develop the ties with
other institutions and non-European countries]{.underline}** necessary
to provide for the common defense. For all its faults, **[NATO enables
the United States to partner with close democratic allies]{.underline}**
in ways that would be **[difficult without a formal
institution]{.underline}** that provides a headquarters and ready venue
for decision-making, as well as **[legitimacy and support for action
that ad hoc U.S.-led coalitions do not.]{.underline}** As has been true
since the fall of the Berlin Wall two decades ago, the United States
(and Europe) should want **[NATO]{.underline}** to succeed. After the
Cold War, the alliance dramatically redefined itself. In the 1990s, it
**[fostered stability across Europe]{.underline}** by beginning its
process of enlargement to the formerly communist east and by intervening
to stop genocide in the Balkans. In the 2000s, **[it broadened its scope
through]{.underline}** the mission in Afghanistan as well as a
**[counterterrorist operation]{.underline}** in the Mediterranean and
counterpiracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and off the Horn of Africa (in
addition to continuing the enlargement process). But as NATO has
broadened its scope, some members have grown concerned that the alliance
is shifting its attention away from Europe. These members seek to return
NATO to a more traditional understanding of its role defending against
threats on the continent, particularly as an increasingly authoritarian
and assertive Russian government has sought to reclaim a sphere of
influence lost in the Soviet collapse. In November 2010, NATO will
release a new "strategic concept" to guide the alliance going forward.
That document must state clearly that providing for collective defense
in the twenty-first century goes well beyond defending against the
"armed attack" of Article V. To remain relevant, **[NATO]{.underline}**
must expand its traditional understanding of collective defense to
**[confront the twenty-first-century threats of terrorism, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to both states and nonstate actors,
and cyberwarfare.]{.underline}** By necessity, the United States has
turned its attention away from Europe in order to **[counter these
modern threats]{.underline}**, which largely emanate from Africa, the
broader Middle East, and Asia. **[If NATO fails]{.underline}** to accept
a growing global role, **[then the United States will lose interest in
investing]{.underline}** in the alliance's future. But Europe faces
these threats too and must recognize that a more **[robust NATO
offers]{.underline}** it **[the chance to counter them.]{.underline}**
Given the varied nature and source of threats today, NATO can be
successful only if the Europeans agree to stronger NATO-European Union
(EU) cooperation and to closer ties with major non-European democracies,
particularly those in the AsiaPacific region.

Assistant Secretary-General David van Weel explains that although
[financial support from companies]{.mark} and start-ups [are crucial for
funding]{.mark} the research projects, intellectual property will not be
requested]{.underline}** (Vivienne Machi, 2021). This is where academia
joins the operation, providing the necessary technical knowledge for the
development and creation of technologies to improve Emerging and
Disruptive Technologies (EDTs): **[Artificial intelligence
([AI]{.mark}), [quantum]{.mark}-enable technologies, and
big-[data]{.mark} processing. This takes place on top of supporting the
remaining EDTs: Data and Computing, Autonomy, Biotechnology and Human
enhancements, Hypersonic technologies, and Space]{.underline}** (Tania
Latici, 2021).

**[Assistant Secretary-General van Weel also pointed out that the
defence community has a wide range of technological needs that go way
beyond the expected ones. Interested start-ups and Small to Medium-sized
Enterprises (SME's) are welcome to get to know the
project.]{.underline}** Thus, they can enter a trusted capital
marketplace that connects qualified investors pre-selected NATO with
start-ups, generating a strong network crucial for the development of
DIANA. Assistant Secretary-General van Weel further explained that SME's
and start-ups would not solely provide funds, as NM have exceptionally
agreed on building a venture capital fund for providing economic support
to companies that develop dual-use and key technologies that could be of
use for NATO. The NATO Innovation Fund is a bold optional investment on
a 15-year time plan with an expected budget of €70 million annually
(Vivienne Machi, 2021). Nonetheless, as van Weel stated, "I read
somewhere that NATO is not a bank --- we are not, but it will be a
country that will fund and give a general direction." **[This fund was
inspired by the US Department of Defense project "Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA)" established in 2019 that has proven to be an
efficient financial mechanism (Fuentitech, 2021) and aims to provide
extra financial aid to DIANA.]{.underline}**

**[[By investing in disruptive technologies, NATO expects to be ready
for the emerging security challenges]{.mark} facing the NM in this new
era of warfare.]{.underline}** **[By joining forces, efforts, and funds
with SME's, investors, and start-ups, NATO focuses on enhancing
technological and digital defence mechanisms.]{.underline}** These can
create more independence and self-sufficiency, allowing NM to achieve
the competitive military technological level of the United States and
China. The Assistant Secretary-General argued that defence innovation
has come a long way since the 1970s. The lack of proper investment in
the field has put NM in a dependent relationship with the current world
leaders in the area, namely the United States and China. **[In this
sense, the [DIANA initiative is presented as an alternative]{.mark}
solution [that will boost economic]{.mark}, military, [and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological [development]{.mark} for NM]{.underline}** (Maija
Palmer, 2021).

**[[DIANA]{.mark} also aims to [decrease]{.mark} the [gap]{.mark}
between SME's [and investors, positively affecting an economic
exchange]{.mark} that will impact future disruptive technologies
investment as a whole, benefiting all seven
areas: ]{.underline}**artificial intelligence; quantum-enabled
technologies; big data processing; hypersonics; biotechnology; space and
autonomy not only the military and defence inclined ones (Jane Edwards,
2021). **[[DIANA combines a multitude of strategic needs]{.mark}: the
start-up function for trustworthy stakeholders while developing new
technologies, the academic content producing function that provides the
intellectual and technical support]{.underline}** to the creation and
analysis of imminent technologies, and the funding function from
government and stakeholders that hold the capital power but lack the
creational capabilities.

**[After reaching its full capacities, [DIANA]{.mark} is scheduled [to
become the focal point for NM to cooperate and coordinate the
development of new military technologies]{.mark} through the offices and
tests centres that will be placed in the Alliance
countries]{.underline}** (Antonela Ionita, 2021). DIANA will have two
headquarters, in North America and Europe, that will work closely
together with their subordinated centres. **[Alongside this, the
maintenance of the network line that will connect start-ups, academia,
and stakeholders will be thoroughly coordinated by DIANA]{.underline}**.
Contrary to some doubts raised, DIANA does not present a threat to the
NATO Industry Forum (NIF), but is instead a completely different
community aiming to adapt NM's military strategies to the challenges
imposed by the new era of warfare (Fuentitech, 2021). 

**[NIF and DIANA will operate independently and will both abide by the
Secretary-General]{.underline}** (SACEUR), Supreme Allied Commander
Transformation (SACT), **[and NATO. It is key to allow both projects the
freedom to create and innovate that comes with the risks of not always
achieving a successful outcome.]{.underline}** The world's most
impactful defence organisations and leading start-ups have embedded
risk-taking in their culture, as it is the only way to assure
innovation, even if it is not necessarily the safest. **[This is why the
[funding for this project is a collaboration between government and
non-government actors, to allow the enhancement of military
tech]{.mark}nology and disruptive technological advances of NATO
Allies]{.underline}** (Nicholas Nelson, 2021).

#### NATO is already involved in setting Allied targets for emerging technology and building industry partnerships -- solves the aff better while avoiding direct engagement.

(Jamie Shea, 3-30-2016, \"Resilience: a core element of collective
defence,\" NATO Review,

In a globalised but also more confrontational and complex world,
resilience will remain an ongoing concern for Allies, requiring constant
adaptation as new vulnerabilities and threats emerge. Virtual
vulnerabilities Cyber space is perhaps the most extreme form of this
vulnerability as it interconnects the entire planet in real time, making
it possible for anybody to attack any electronically operated target
from anywhere at any moment. This vastly complicates the task of
defenders, who can rarely know in advance that an attack is being
launched, where it will strike or where it will originate. So the
defender has to try to protect every important part of the national
economic or military infrastructure all the time, while the attacker can
choose the individual segment or vulnerable fault line that he wishes to
disrupt. SCADAs -- or automated control systems for electrical grids or
energy pipelines -- are just one example of how infrastructure that we
depend on for the normal functioning of our lives is increasingly
automated, remotely controlled or integrated into ever more complex
networks, which are vulnerable to attack. SCADAs -- or automated control
systems for electrical grids or energy pipelines -- are just one example
of how infrastructure that we depend on for the normal functioning of
our lives is increasingly automated, remotely controlled or integrated
into ever more complex networks, which are vulnerable to attack. As we
move from the internet of things to the internet of everything, more and
more of the infrastructure that we depend on for the normal functioning
of our lives is being automated or controlled from remoter distances or
integrated into ever more complex networks. The SCADAs -- or automated
control systems for electrical grids or energy pipelines -- are but one
example. So are cross-border grids which means an energy blackout in
Italy can immediately turn off the power in parts of Switzerland, or an
overload at one transmission plant in India can plunge 400 million
people into temporary darkness, to cite just two recent examples. The
globalisation of networks and the increasing integration of physical
infrastructure into the virtual world, for instance the storage of data
not in machines but in 'clouds', has certainly brought about
efficiencies and savings. But it has also greatly magnified the
consequences of a disruption and the number of key nodal points and
attack surfaces that malevolent actors can exploit. Civil preparedness A
second tendency increasing the sense of societal vulnerability is the
state of civil preparedness within the Alliance. The delivery of forces
and military capabilities that NATO needs to uphold collective defence
or to project forces beyond its territory relies on civilian resources.
During the Cold War, many of these, such as railways, ports, airfields,
grids or airspace were in state hands and easily transferred to NATO
control in a crisis or wartime situation. Today, by contrast, 90 per
cent of NATO's supplies and logistics are moved by private companies and
75 per cent of the host nation support for NATO forces forward deployed
on the territory of the eastern Allies comes from private sector
contracts. Similarly, when facing distributed denial of service
cyber-attacks against its outward-facing networks, NATO has relied on
cooperation from the telecoms sector and the internet security companies
to filter and capture data, identify malware and provide extra
bandwidth. Without doubt the transfer of ownership and responsibility to
the private sector has brought cost-efficiencies; but the quest to
reduce costs and overheads to increase profitability has also led to
less redundancy and less resilience. In addition, as hybrid threats
below the threshold of NATO's collective defence clause (Article 5 of
its founding treaty) blur the traditional distinction between peace and
war, government special powers based on wartime emergency legislation
have become less practical to implement or even obsolete. Whether it be
for mobilizing troops for collective defence or to strengthen the
ability to defend against -- or recover from -- hybrid attack, NATO is
increasingly dependent on infrastructure and assets in the private
sector. Whether it be for mobilizing troops for collective defence or to
strengthen the ability to defend against -- or recover from -- hybrid
attack, NATO is increasingly dependent on infrastructure and assets in
the private sector. As a result, NATO faces two distinct but
inter-related resilience challenges: first, to ensure that it can
speedily move all the forces and equipment required to any part of the
Alliance facing an imminent threat or attack, ensuring full and
unimpeded access to all the infrastructure it needs for this purpose;
and second, to be able to anticipate, identify, mitigate and recover
from hybrid attacks with minimum disruptive impact on the Alliance's
social, political and military cohesion. Civil preparedness is, above
all, a national responsibility, in the same way that Allies must ensure
adequate cyber defence for their critical information technology
networks, especially the ones that NATO depends on for its own
operations. This said, Allies' security relies on individual nations
upholding this commitment; and NATO has an interest in obtaining as much
transparency as possible, so that it can assess potential
vulnerabilities or gaps and accurately measure progress. Avoiding
unpleasant surprises in crisis situations when the Alliance needs swift
and reliable information and the capacity to analyse, decide and respond
swiftly has to be the goal. Consequently, the theme of 'resilience' --
how to define it, assess it and enhance it across the Alliance -- has
become a leading topic for the NATO Summit in Warsaw, in July.
Resilience is increasingly seen as the corollary of deterrence and
reassurance measures in the classical military sphere as part of a
comprehensive security strategy for the Alliance. The seven baseline
requirements to be assessed are: 1) assured continuity of government and
critical government services; 2) resilient energy supplies; 3) ability
to deal effectively with the uncontrolled movement of people; 4)
resilient food and water resources; 5) ability to deal with mass
casualties; 6) resilient communications systems; and finally 7)
resilient transportation systems. These seven areas apply to the entire
crisis spectrum, from an evolving hybrid threat all the way up to the
most demanding scenarios envisaged by Alliance planners. So how can NATO
make its contribution to improving resilience within its 28 Allied
nations? Five specific areas come to mind: Cyber defence The first is
cyber defence. NATO experiences 200 million incidents on its networks
every day and around 200 more serious intrusion attempts every month.
This level of hostile activity is also what Allies are experiencing as
the 'new normal' in the cyber domain. NATO's first task has been to
upgrade the protection of its own networks by giving the NATO Cyber
Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) additional capabilities for earlier
detection and more rapid response to cyberattacks. Two Rapid Response
teams have also been created to assist Allies, as well as to manage
incidents affecting NATO itself. **[NATO has now moved on to help Allies
improve their cyber resilience by introducing capability targets into
the NATO defence planning process and devising a new memorandum of
understanding between NATO and individual Allies to establish secure
connectivity and arrangements for information-sharing and crisis
management.]{.underline}** A number of [**Allies have come together to
develop specific capabilities in fields such as a malware
information-sharing platform, training and education, and systems
configuration for effective decision-making.**]{.underline} The NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia has helped
NATO to organize state-of-the art annual exercises to improve the skills
of cyber operators using a cyber range that Estonia has transferred to
NATO. Finally, and given the importance of industry that owns 90 per
cent of the networks NATO and the Allies depend on, **[the Alliance is
developing a NATO-industry cyber partnership to encourage
information-sharing and best practices. This will give NATO a better
grasp of the rapid pace of innovation in the sphere of information
technology and how it can better integrate emerging technologies and new
concepts into its cyber defence.]{.underline}** The proposal to create
**[an 'innovation hub' at the NATO Communications and Information Agency
should facilitate this dialogue and mutual understanding between NATO
and the small-and-medium-size technology providers that are often the
most innovative in this area.]{.underline}** As the Alliance looks
towards the Warsaw Summit, some further measures are on the table. One
is a 'cyber defence pledge' or commitment to speed up national
implementation of the NATO capability targets, which requires sustained
national focus and adequate resources. A second idea is to look into the
political, legal and operational consequences of declaring cyber as a
domain, as many Allies have done already in terms of their national
cyber strategies. This reflects the increasing awareness that most
conflicts and crises these days have a cyber dimension and that -- as
NATO increases the momentum of its military activities for collective
defence -- NATO commanders need the requisite tools and authorities to
defend against advanced cyberattacks and to operate across the cyber
spectrum. Hybrid threats A second area of resilience is a strategy to
respond to hybrid warfare which NATO foreign ministers approved last
December. **[NATO is improving its intelligence-sharing and early
warning processes in order to better anticipate and map hybrid warfare
activities]{.underline}**. It is developing in this respect a set of
early warning indicators that can trigger a number of crisis-response
options. This is because rapid identification of a hybrid attack (as
opposed to an isolated or random incident) and speedy decision-making
are essential to nip these attacks in the bud and block escalation. NATO
ambassadors and defence ministers have held simulation and
scenario-based exercises to fine-tune their situational awareness and
responsiveness vis-à-vis threats, which are specifically designed to be
ambiguous and difficult to attribute. Effective strategic communications
to dispel false information, propaganda, lies and myths is also an
essential part of coping with hybrid attacks that seek to confuse public
opinion, aggravate social tensions and undermine trust in governments.
All this does not mean that Allies are as vulnerable to a hybrid attack
as Ukraine proved to be during Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.
However, **[Allies are now encouraged to map potential vulnerabilities
that can arise from Russia's involvement in business, financial, media
or energy concerns, for example, and to share the lessons learned from
resilience stress testing more broadly within NATO.]{.underline}**
Civil-military readiness A third area under discussion concerns NATO's
ability to fully implement its Readiness Action Plan for the
reinforcement and defence of Allies, whether to the east or to the
south. NATO members have to adjust their territorial defence mechanisms
and infrastructure to the new security environment and revive the
planning fora that existed during the Cold War. In particular, NATO
planners require cross-border transit arrangements for the rapid
deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force and NATO Response
Force. As new Graduated Response Plans for detailed collective defence
arrangements are adopted, the Allies must ensure that elements such as
transport, flight corridors, civil-military airspace coordination, fuel
stocks, pre-positioned equipment, port access and legal agreements are
fully integrated into military planning. Crisis-response measures to
activate civil emergency measures will need to be updated and civil
defence requirements will need to be given more attention, based on the
military requirements for the Readiness Action Plan and associated
capability packages for its deployment. A more sustained dialogue
between military commanders and national civil emergency authorities is
now being established. Stepping up cooperation with the EU A fourth area
is the relationship between NATO and the European Union (EU). The two
organisations occupy different parts of the resilience spectrum but
there is also considerable overlap in the middle. A joined-up approach
based on a shared situational awareness and coordination of responses is
key to a successful response. Currently NATO is talking with the EU on
enhanced cooperation in four areas: civil-military planning; cyber
defence; information-sharing; and analysis and coordinated strategic
communication to spot disinformation and communicate a credible
narrative. One early deliverable is a technical arrangement between the
NATO NCIRC and the EU Computer Emergency Response Team (EU CERT) for the
exchange of information, which was concluded in early February. Up to
the Warsaw Summit, NATO and the EU are continuing their discussions at
the staff level, as the EU finalises its own strategy to respond to
hybrid threats. The aim is to harmonise procedures and to support each
other's efforts in responding comprehensively. The ambition is to
identify pragmatic, flexible approaches which could be reflected in a
joint declaration by NATO and the EU at the Warsaw Summit. NATO and the
EU are also developing compatible 'playbooks' to ensure more
participation in each other's activities, such as exercises and
training. It is also important that NATO and the EU work together to
tackle other resilience challenges that do not result from deliberate
attacks. The most urgent of these is the migration crisis. NATO has
recently deployed a maritime task force in the Aegean to work with
Greece and Turkey and the EU border agency, Frontex, to monitor the flow
of refugees and migrants and in this way help to curb the illegal
activities of smugglers and traffickers. Working with partner countries
Finally, NATO's partners can also help to improve the Alliance's overall
resilience. Not only Ukraine but many other partners have been the
victim of hybrid operations. Their experiences and lessons learned can
help NATO to better understand the type and impact of hybrid tactics.
More information-sharing and early warning can help NATO decision-makers
to identify incipient attacks that could start in a partner country but
rapidly spread to NATO territory. Conversely, NATO's experience and
expertise can help partners improve their own capacity for resilience.
Unsurprisingly resilience areas like cyber defence and civil emergency
planning are increasingly featuring in defence capacity building
packages for partners such as Georgia, Moldova, Jordan and Iraq. In the
Baltic region, Sweden and Finland -- two of NATO's most active partners,
which have enhanced opportunities for dialogue and cooperation -- have
also faced hybrid pressures from Russia. These Nordic partners have
drawn closer to NATO through consultations, training and exercises,
including the conclusion of host nation support arrangements for crisis
assistance. In conclusion, Allies need to adapt constantly as new
vulnerabilities and threats emerge from non-state actors such as
so-called Islamic State, as much as from state actors like Russia.
Resilience is here to stay as a core element of collective defence. That
is why NATO will stay focused on reducing its exposure to threats to its
cohesion, independence and security.2

STUTTGART, Germany --- **[In less than two years, NATO hopes to have its
own]{.underline}**, modified version of the U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (**[DARPA) up and running. Alliance members
agreed]{.underline}** at the 31st annual summit, held June 14 in
Brussels, **[to launch a new initiative dubbed]{.underline}** the
Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic, or **[DIANA, meant
to speed up trans-Atlantic cooperation on critical
technologies]{.underline}**, **[and help NATO work more closely with
private-sector entities, academia and other non-governmental entities.
The goal is to have DIANA reach initial operating capability (IOC) by
2023]{.underline}**, David van Weel, assistant secretary-general for
emerging security challenges, said at a Tuesday virtual roundtable with
reporters. By next year, the hope is to have "the initial parts ...
starting to come up into fruition," he added. In the long term, DIANA
will have headquarters both in North America and in Europe, and link to
existing test centers throughout NATO member countries that **[will be
used for "validating, testing, and co-designing applications in the
field of emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline}**," van Weel
said. **[DIANA will also be responsible for building and managing a
network meant to help relevant startups grow and support NATO's
technology needs via grant programs]{.underline}**. **[The focus will be
on national security and defense purposes]{.underline}**, and DIANA will
not ask for or solicit companies' intellectual property, van Weel noted.
**[While he singled out artificial intelligence, big-data processing,
and quantum-enabled technologies, DIANA is meant to
support]{.underline}** all seven of the key emerging and disruptive
technologies --- or EDTs --- that NATO has identified as critical for
the future. The other four include: **[autonomy, biotechnology,
hypersonics and space]{.underline}**. Sometimes a technology company may
not realize that their product could be viable for the defense
community, he added. **[One key component of DIANA will be a trusted
capital marketplace, where smaller companies can connect with
pre-qualified investors who are interested in supporting NATO's
technology efforts]{.underline}**. Ensuring that investors are vetted
ahead of time will allow NATO to ensure "that the technology will be
protected from illicit transfers," van Weel said. **[The fund is modeled
after a The U.S. Defense Department]{.underline}** set up its own
trusted capital marketplace in 2019 as a tool that then-DoD acquisition
czar Ellen Lord said could help encourage domestically based venture
capitalists to fund national security and defense projects. That
marketplace served as inspiration for the announced NATO trusted capital
marketplace, per the alliance. **[Members also agreed for the first time
to build up a venture capital fund to support companies developing
dual-use and key technologies that could be useful to
NATO,]{.underline}** and which will be optional for member-nations to
participate in. The NATO Innovation Fund, as it's called, would have a
running time of about 15 years to start, and would be underwritten by
about 70 million euro (about \$83 million) per year, per van Weel.
**[The goal is not for NATO headquarters or for its member-nations to
run the innovation fund]{.underline}**, he noted. "**[The actual running
of a venture capital fund, we believe, should be done by companies that
have a broad range of experience in the field]{.underline}**." He cited
the U.S.-based capital venture firm In-Q-Tel as an example of the type
of partner NATO would seek to run the "day-to-day" business of the fund.
"I read somewhere that NATO is not a bank---we're not," van Weel said.
"But it will be the nations providing the funds, and giving the general
direction." **[These two initiatives of a technology accelerator and
innovation fund are "hopefully going to ... bring the alliance forward
into the 21st century]{.underline}**," van Weel said. NATO has
previously invested in information technology (IT) and software through
the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA), but the
difference with the innovation fund, and DIANA, is that the alliance
wants to better connect with early-stage startups, rather than larger
software companies or traditional defense firms, van Weel said.
"**[DIANA is not about taking over innovation for the NATO
enterprise]{.underline}**," he said. "**[It's a different
community]{.underline}**, **[and requires different funding mechanisms
and different types of engagement."]{.underline}** These two initiatives
have been long awaited and demanded by NATO observers, and versions of
both a "DARPA-like" technology accelerator and an alliance-wide
investment bank were included in a 2020 list of recommendations by
NATO's advisory group on emerging and disruptive technologies. But it is
still early days. While the IOC goal is 2023, "step one is we want to
know from allies what they want to offer to DIANA," van Weel said. Once
the NATO Innovation Fund has its participating members, for example, a
charter will be set up that will lay out the funding models, rapid
contracting processes, and leadership guidelines. "**[We are trying to
do this as fast as we can,"]{.underline}** van Weel assured, but then
noted, "we do want to get it right, because ... with the startup
community, you only get one chance."

published last week, following a meeting of NATO defence ministers. This
is not the only military research announcement to [pop
up](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/science-goes-war-western-allies-step-collaboration-military-research) in
the past weeks, with the US, Australia and UK setting out the AUKUS
Quantum arrangement which eyes expanded quantum, hypersonic and other
joint weapons research.

Technology dominance

**[[The nine techn]{.mark}ologies [NATO wants to advance]{.mark} are AI;
data and computing; autonomy; quantum-enabled technologies;
biotechnology and human enhancements; hypersonic technologies; space;
novel materials and manufacturing; and energy and
propulsion.]{.underline}**

**[These [are all strategic for NATO if it is to maintain
tech]{.mark}nological [dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Losing grip was
one of the drivers for DIANA, Jermalavičius says.

The bid for technology dominance over countries like China and Russia is
also a driver for DIANA's goal of shortening the technology development
cycle, especially when it comes to software, AI and quantum. "It's a
long horizon, but capabilities do not appear overnight," said
Jermalavičius.

The plan is for DIANA to launch challenge calls for non-dilutive
financing that does not require start-ups to give up equity or ownership
in their company. Mentoring, technology testing and potential contract
opportunities will be available to go hand in hand with the financing.

This will be delivered through network of innovation hubs across the
alliance. One such site is the Big Data for Smart Society Institute
(GATE) based in Bulgaria. An official at GATE said that the institute's
work in DIANA will focus on digital health, intra governmental
communications and using data in industry and city infrastructure. One
focus will be on disinformation research.

**[[However the official noted DIANA is still in its early
stages]{.mark}. [Talks are ongoing with NATO to flesh ou]{.mark}t
exactly [how cooperation will work]{.mark} between research
centres]{.underline}**, the national government, and the NATO
secretariat.

The approved charter stipulates some details, though others are still to
be discussed, for example the affiliated centres of the network and the
points of contact between them. **[The official said that many of [these
are likely to be finalised]{.mark} at a meeting [at the end of
June]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Euractiv,
https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/opinion/emerging-technology-the-geo-economic-achilles-heel-nato-needs-to-address/

To ensure NATO's relevance and to keep "our people safe", the Alliance
"must continue to strengthen and modernize our deterrence and defence,"
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Riga Summit on 30
November 2021. Innovation plays a critical role in modernizing armed
forces amid a complex strategic environment.

To this purpose, **[Stoltenberg unveiled the Defence Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic ([DIANA]{.mark}) on 22 October 2021.
DIANA shall [bring defence and commercial companies together]{.mark}
with military users to develop novel solutions that meet the needs of
the future battlefield.]{.underline}** He also launched the NATO
Innovation Fund to invest up to €1bn to support innovators developing
emerging technologies.

**[The announcement comes at a time when the [Alliance]{.mark} is
[working on a new Strategic Concept.]{.mark} Innovation will be key to
preserving NATO's edge]{.underline}**, as the Secretary-General pointed
out in his 2030 food for thought paper. Although NATO is a potent
defence organization, emphasis on emerging technologies reveals its
Achilles' heel.

**[[A]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence, autonomy,
[biotech]{.mark}nology, [quantum]{.mark} technology, [and other
tech]{.mark}nologies are at the heart of geoeconomic
competition]{.underline}**. Geoeconomic competition unfolds around the
projection of economic power within and across the domains of land, air,
sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve political goals.

Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business models amid a
growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven nations. It
aims to set the rules, principles, and standards that guide economic
activities and access to and ownership of emerging technologies.

NATO's current emphasis on emerging technologies with defence and
commercial applications risks making the Alliance subject to this new
geoeconomic dynamic. **[This [dynamic]{.mark} can [undermine NATO's
innovation agenda]{.mark} and endanger its strategic edge. Therefore,
NATO needs to respond.]{.underline}**

**[First, [NATO will embrace the]{.mark} realities of [economic
security]{.mark} seriously. This call flows logically from Article 2 of
the North Atlantic Treaty, [encouraging allies' economic
collaborations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[In our view, economic security combines national security and
economic policy with technology and innovation policy to identify
economic disruptions. It also prevents these disruptions from arising
and strengthens a coping capacity to deal with economic
emergencies.]{.underline}**

**[[Economic security requires allies]{.mark}, for example, [to
engage]{.mark} on defence-critical [standards]{.mark}, advancing
transparency for defence supply chains, and considering the interplay
between technology development, foreign direct investment, and export
control. Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should incorporate
economic security as an essential element.]{.underline}**

Second, economic security requires NATO to shape mindsets about defence
investments and sustainability. Already today, defence companies face
financial challenges as banks cancel bank accounts or refrain from
covering export risks.

The emphasis on environmental, social, and governance criteria (ESG)
that increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will
reinforce these problems as defence is considered toxic. But a narrow
interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible with the world
view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition to invest in
companies. It also means other investors will likely shy away from
investing in the same companies.

Therefore, the Alliance needs to step up activities with the European
Commission, which works on a classification system to identify
ESG-compliant activities, to make defence investments compatible.

**[Third, [business]{.mark} [is the first line of defence in a
geoeconomic world, and NATO needs a platform to discuss geoeconomics
with business.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Today, the NATO Industry Forum is the leading gathering to address
defence industrial matters with defence companies. However, the emphasis
on emerging technologies underlines the importance of non-defence
companies.

**[Therefore, [NATO should]{.mark} envisage a new special format of the
North Atlantic Council to [meet with the NATO Industry Forum
members]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and possibly also the European
Commission **[-- to allow state and corporate leaders to jointly engage
on the proposed economic security agenda.]{.underline}**

Fourth, strategic-level public-private dialogue also breathes new life
into deepening cooperation with the private sector. NATO should become
an early adopter of the solutions developed with allied money.

**[Making NATO the launch customer sends important market signals and
provides companies with an initial track record confirming the relevance
of their solutions]{.underline}**. In addition, the Alliance should step
up efforts to incorporate business into military operations. Logistics
companies already play a crucial role, and traditional defence
businesses provide frontline support.

The next stage comes with closely integrating digital companies to
leverage their contribution. But for non-defence companies to provide
frontline support, NATO not only needs the right mindset, but the
Alliance also needs to think about incentives such as covering personnel
risks on overseas deployments.

**[Finally, [NATO's ability to stimulate innovation and ensure economic
security]{.mark} also [depends on]{.mark} how it does
[business]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Critically, NATO needs to strive for a mission and capabilities-based
innovation portfolio that maximises the value of allied money. NATO may
take a page from the financial services industry and use a real options
approach to manage technological risk and drive technology development.
This approach prices technology building blocks like financial options,
advances risk mitigation, speeds up technology adoption and gives force
planners and developers more leeway to maximise input and output.

In addition, NATO should offer strategic hedging solutions for defence
critical raw materials by combining corporate demand estimates with
AI-based insights on financial and raw material markets. This will
facilitate optimal, company-tailored hedging strategies to mitigate the
corporate security of supply and price risks.

Overall, NATO's relevance in the 21st century remains tackling defence
challenges in a new strategic environment, increasingly defined by
emerging and rapidly changing technologies and the profoundly important
role of the private sector. To this purpose, NATO has embraced
innovation and emerging technologies.

<https://cepa.org/getting-nato-innovation-right/> //um-ef)

The **[[Defense Innovation Accelerator]{.underline}]{.mark}** and NATO
Innovation Fund announced at the NATO Summit are welcome developments,
but they require new authorities and differentiated talent. Swift
technological change has meant governments and the military created new
organizations and approaches to innovation and rapid acquisition.
Unfortunately, many do not have the necessary authority, budget, or
workforce to succeed, meaning that meaningful change and impact have
been sacrificed for theater. For the newly announced Defense Innovation
Accelerator North Atlantic (**[[DIANA)]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- with
planned locations in Toronto and Cambridge, UK -- and the NATO
Innovation Fund (NIF) to succeed, they **[[must address authority and
budget concerns, and then bring in the right personnel to lead and staff
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Authorities There are three key authorities
that NATO must get right for DIANA and NIF: **[[reporting lines,
patience]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or willingness to accept failure),
**[[and decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, **[[DIANA and NIF
should operate independently]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[with a direct
line into the most senior decision-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the
Secretary General, SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation ---
SACT, etc). Second, **[[they need to be allowed to
fail]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most impactful defense organizations
(and indeed commercial organizations, particularly in the startup world)
normalize taking big bets, with the knowledge that many will likely
fail, and even the ones that succeed may take years to realize their
full impact. Third and finally, **[[these new NATO bodies need to invest
in or provide support to initiatives and startups without requiring
external permission or consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same
time, they also need a clear transition partner for promising
capabilities to be handed off to (e.g. DARPA transitioning tech to the
U.S. Department of Defense), which can move from development to
deployment. **[[This will enable the Alliance to more readily identify,
develop, and deploy emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similar efforts including the U.S.
Department of Defense's DARPA and Defense Innovation Unit, CIA's
In-Q-Tel, and USAF's Strategic Capabilities Office, are effective
because they exist outside of traditional bureaucracies, leverage
non-traditional talent strategies, and have consistent budgets. Budget
Allocating funding seems obvious, but too often limited forethought is
given to this issue. To ensure success, organizational funding must be
significant, multi-year, and consistent or include inbuilt annual
growth. A number of high-potential initiatives have either been
announced with no dedicated funding or have had sizable funding gaps in
subsequent years damaging their brand and relationships with defense
companies and startups alike. The NIF in particular will likely rely on
the willingness of Alliance members to make contributions beyond other
NATO obligations. If so, multi-year commitments are crucial, as are
success metrics, such as return on investment, which are rarely used
within NATO or national government departments. Talent Finally, and most
overlooked, is getting talent right. External talent is crucial. It is
not enough to simply construct new organizations staffed in the
traditional manner. To realize their full potential, NATO must attract
talent with startup and/or venture capital (VC) experience, and pair
them with top subject-matter experts from R&D communities, both
government, and commercial. This cannot be done with NATO's current
Byzantine, long, drawn-out hiring process, which can last six months or
even longer, and advantage insiders versus external candidates. As such
the Alliance must engage and attract this talent. The good news is NATO
has a number of potential examples to draw on for potential hiring
pathways. In the U.S. the Defense Digital Service hires design and
technical experts for one-to-two "tours of duty," using their skillsets
and operate outside the traditional civil service. In the UK, strategy
and technology professionals are seconded into the Ministry of Defence,
the Department of Trade, and intelligence organizations such as GCHQ, to
provide experience or skills that may not exist within the current civil
service workforce. But providing pathways alone is not enough:
attracting this talent to apply and convincing them to join is just as
important. This requires identifying areas where they might work,
including industry, academia, and startups, and VC. At the same time,
other steps are needed. Upskilling existing NATO civilians -- among the
international and international military staff (IS and IMS) --- and
Alliance service members are needed to address this skill and
understanding gap. To do so, it is helpful to expose them to startup and
VC environments. Programs like Shift's Defense Ventures Program in the
U.S. have succeeded in building understanding between the Department of
Defense's civilian and military workforce and startups and VCs. They've
done so by bringing in high-performing defense personnel for eight-week
immersions with growing venture-backed startups or VC firms. This
cultivates the necessary connective tissue between startups, VCs, and
the military. NATO could readily follow a similar process by providing
its highest performers the opportunity to temporarily work alongside
leading North American and European startups and investors. What's Next?
**[Accelerating the development, deployment, and integration of emerging
and disruptive technologies into the strategic and tactical environments
is at the core of future NATO operations.]{.underline}** **[The
Alliance's move to build DIANA and NIF, along with incorporating the
right language into strategic documents are significant first
steps]{.underline}**. **[But building these initiatives from scratch
will require significant planning to establish the right authorities,
budget, and talent environment to enable these organizations to thrive.
In order to do so, they need to build outside of traditional NATO
structures and models while creating a differentiated talent and
organizational culture]{.underline}**.

### Impacts \-\-- EU Solves

#### EU Compass already includes increased focus on emerging technologies -- complementarity means NATO should stay out

**EU Council '22** \-- (Council of the EU, 3-21-2022, \"A Strategic
Compass for a stronger EU security and defence in the next decade,\"
Council of the European Union,
https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/21/a-strategic-compass-for-a-stronger-eu-security-and-defence-in-the-next-decade/,
accessed 6-18-2022) \-- nikki

Today the Council has formally approved the Strategic Compass, at a time
when we witness the return of war in Europe. The Compass gives the
European Union an ambitious plan of action for strengthening the EU\'s
security and defence policy by 2030. The more hostile security
environment requires us to make a quantum leap forward and increase our
capacity and willingness to act, strengthen our resilience, and invest
more and better in our defence capabilities. The strength of our Union
lies in unity, solidarity and determination. The objective of the
Strategic Compass is to make the EU a stronger and more capable security
provider. The EU needs to be able to protect its citizens and to
contribute to international peace and security. This is all the more
important at a time when war has returned to Europe, following the
unjustified and unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well
as of major geopolitical shifts. This Strategic Compass will enhance the
EU's strategic autonomy and its ability to work with partners to
safeguard its values and interests. A stronger and more capable EU in
security and defence will contribute positively to global and
transatlantic security and is complementary to NATO, which remains the
foundation of collective defence for its members. It will also intensify
support for the global rules-based order, with the United Nations at its
core. Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy The threats are rising and the cost
of inaction is clear. The Strategic Compass is a guide for action. It
sets out an ambitious way forward for our security and defence policy
for the next decade. It will help us face our security responsibilities,
in front of our citizens and the rest of the world. If not now, then
when? Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy The Strategic Compass provides a
shared assessment of the strategic environment in which the EU is
operating and of the threats and challenges the Union faces. The
document makes concrete and actionable proposals, with a very precise
timetable for implementation, in order to improve the EU\'s ability to
act decisively in crises and to defend its security and its citizens.
The Compass covers all the aspects of the security and defence policy
and is structured around four pillars: act, invest, partner and secure.
Act In order to be able to act rapidly and robustly whenever a crisis
erupts, with partners if possible and alone when necessary, the EU
will: - establish a strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity of up to 5000
troops for different types of crises - be ready to deploy 200 fully
equipped CSDP mission experts within 30 days, including in complex
environments - conduct regular live exercises on land and at sea -
enhance military mobility - reinforce the EU\'s civilian and military
CSDP (Common Defence and Security Policy) missions and operations by
promoting a rapid and more flexible decision-making process , acting in
a more robust way and ensuring greater financial solidarity - make full
use of the European Peace Facility to support partners Secure In order
to strengthen its ability to anticipate, deter and respond to current
and fast-emerging threats and challenges, and safeguard the EU\'s
security interest, the EU will: - boost its intelligence analysis
capacities - **[develop Hybrid Toolbox and Response Teams bringing
together different instruments to detect and respond to a broad range of
hybrid threats - further develop the Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox and set up
an EU Cyber Defence Policy to be better prepared for and respond to
cyberattacks]{.underline}** - develop a Foreign Information Manipulation
and Interference Toolbox - develop an EU Space Strategy for Security and
Defence - strengthen the EU's role as a maritime security actor Invest
Member states have committed to substantially enhance their defence
expenditures to match our collective ambition to reduce critical
military and civilian capability gaps and strengthen our European
Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The EU will: - exchange on
national objectives on increased and improved defence spending to match
our security needs - **[provide further incentives for member states to
engage in collaborative capability development and jointly invest in
strategic enablers and next generation capabilities to
operate]{.underline}** on land, at sea, in the air, **[in the cyber
domain]{.underline}** and in outer space - **[boost defence
technological innovation to fill strategic gaps and reduce technological
and industrial dependencies]{.underline}** Partner In order to address
common threats and challenges, the EU will: - strengthen cooperation
with strategic partners such as NATO, the UN and regional partners,
including the OSCE, AU and ASEAN - develop more tailored bilateral
partnerships with like-minded countries and strategic partners, such as
the US, Canada, Norway, the UK, Japan and others - develop tailored
partnerships in the Western Balkans, our eastern and southern
neighbourhood, Africa, Asia and Latin America, including through
enhancing dialogue and cooperation, promoting participation in CSDP
missions and operations and supporting capacity- building Background and
next steps The first version of the Strategic Compass was tabled by the
High Representative in November 2021, based on the first ever threat
analysis to which the intelligence services of the 27 EU member states
contributed and a structured dialogue phase amongst EU member states, EU
institutions and experts. Successive versions were discussed in February
and March 2022 to reflect the debate between member states and to take
into account the Commission\'s package on defence and space of 15
February and the latest international developments, including in
particular Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. It contributes
directly to the implementation of the Versailles agenda. Once approved,
the Strategic Compass is then expected to be endorsed by the European
Council on 24-25 March 2022.

European digital autonomy The most important aspect of transatlantic
estrangement, however, is not the loss of trust between the US and
Europe -- which they will eventually reverse. Rather**[, during the four
years of the Trump administration, and partly in response to
isolationist tendencies in the US, Europeans have become much more
comfortable talking about European strategic autonomy or
sovereignty.]{.underline}** Without encouraging the narrative that these
efforts are directed against the US, or were primarily an answer to
Trump, Europeans aim to empower Europe as an actor in its own right. In
**[the technological realm, this led to the idea of European digital
sovereignty, the aim of which is to build up European technological
capabilities]{.underline}**. Although **[European digital
sovereignty]{.underline}** is not specifically targeted at the US, it
has led, among other things, to efforts such as the possible regulation
of American technology companies and concerns over American firms
acquiring European start-ups. European **[campaigners]{.underline}** and
some policymakers **[believe US tech giants such as Google, Apple,
Facebook, and Amazon are forces to protect against. European thinking on
technology partly developed in opposition to the US and US
companies.]{.underline}** Thus, European efforts to build up **[digital
sovereignty may impede transatlantic cooperation. The EU's effort to
strengthen ethical AI, and to make 'trustworthy AI' a unique selling
point for Europe, might also end up creating problems for transatlantic
cooperation.]{.underline}** Many **[EU policymakers believe that the
EU's insistence on ethical AI will eventually become a location
advantage for Europe (]{.underline}**much like data privacy): as more
people become concerned about unethical AI and data security, they will
prefer to use or buy AI 'made in Europe' rather than elsewhere. In this
respect, two European aims are at odds with each other: on the one hand,
Europeans want to ensure that AI is developed and used in an ethical
way. Partnering with a powerful player such as the US on this matter
should be an obvious way to help them achieve this goal. However, **[if
the EU considers ethical AI not just a goal for humanity but a
development that may also create commercial advantages for Europe, then
transatlantic cooperation on this issue is
counterproductive]{.underline}**, as it would undermine Europe's
uniqueness. Finally, **[many Europeans have expressed scepticism about
the extent to which Europe and the US are indeed aligned on ethical AI
principles.]{.underline}** For example, the Danish national AI strategy
argues for a common ethical and human-centred basis for AI. It describes
ethical AI as a particularly European approach: "Europe and Denmark
should not copy the US or China. Both countries are investing heavily in
artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility,
ethical principles and privacy." Many **[Europeans feel that the US "has
no idea how to regulate" cyberspace and continues to show little
enthusiasm for doing so.]{.underline}** The EU, however, likes to think
of itself as a trailblazer when it comes to digital rights, such as the
2014 "right to be forgotten" or the 2018 General Data Protection
Regulation. Differing views on China As noted, only a few European
states look at AI through a geopolitical lens, and EU efforts on this
matter focus primarily on strengthening the EU as a global player. This
means that the American interest in using transatlantic cooperation as a
means to curb Chinese power is likely to have only limited traction in
Europe. And US companies, rather than Chinese ones, currently remain the
primary 'other' for Europe to measure itself against. European
regulation efforts still concentrate on US companies rather than Chinese
firm**[s]{.underline}**. In light of recent changes in language on China
in both NATO and the EU, which describe the country as a "strategic
competitor" and "systemic rival", European and American views of China
may converge eventually. But, at the moment, Europeans do not feel the
same urgency as the US when it comes to pushing back against China.
Unfortunately for those in the US who favour greater transatlantic
cooperation, th**[e European nation that most often thinks in
geopolitical terms, France, is among those most sceptical of the US.
Brexit]{.underline}** Finally, th**[e United Kingdom's exit from the EU
may further complicate transatlantic cooperation on AI.]{.underline}**
Even if the EU and the UK were to decide to work as closely as possible,
**[the EU would no longer be able to speak as much of Europe as
previously. Any transatlantic cooperation on AI will, therefore, require
coordination between three, rather than two, actor]{.underline}**s.
Given the UK's strong technology and AI credentials (AI leader DeepMind
is based in London, although it is now owned by Google's parent company,
Alphabet), the country is likely to want to play an important role in
any future negotiations on AI standards and use.

policies with China's authoritarian approach to autonomous systems and
data storage. On the other hand, **[[NATO is not the forum to solve
EU-US regulatory issues or to devise industrial policy for its
allies]{.mark}. If [NATO wishes to stretch further into non-military
aspects of security without harm to the integrity of its core business,
it needs to enhance]{.mark} the use of its [European
partnerships]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[This concerns [especially the
EU]{.mark} [due to]{.mark} the exclusive [trade competencies]{.mark}
that are [needed for transatlantic harmonization (standard setting,
investment screenings, export controls]{.mark}) [as well as the
significant civilian capacities]{.mark} it coordinates with relevance
for gray-zone defense.]{.underline}** NATO may perhaps see relevance in
deepening its partnerships with Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden due to
the high-tech industries they host (robotics, quantum computing, 5G).
**[As [NATO]{.mark} definitively winds down its operations in
Afghanistan, it [must restrain itself from renewed global
engagements]{.mark}]{.underline}** in view of China's rise. Stoltenberg
has emphasized the relevance of like-minded partner countries in the
Asia-Pacific in preserving the rules-based international order. However,
NATO's cooperation with these partners should focus primarily on their
utility for the alliance's own efforts at supply-chain and technological
decoupling from China. This could also lead to intelligence sharing and
joint military exercises without necessarily giving NATO a global reach.

**[The new NATO Strategic Concept set to be unveiled later this month
will press alliance members to envision deterrence as a matter not just
of tanks and bombs but of]{.underline}** supply chain security,
**[cyberattacks,]{.underline}** climate change,
**[innovation,]{.underline}** and more. "**[The strategic concept needs
to be able to live for the next decade, so it looks far beyond the
current crisis in Ukraine. It looks at the implications
for]{.underline}** our security of...climate change, **[innovation, the
use of...hybrid warfare, cyber war and the role of cyber in our
societies]{.underline}**. But also resilience. **[How resilient are our
Western societies to these kind of attacks]{.underline}** and what do we
need to do in order to tackle that?" David van Weel, **[NATO's assistant
secretary general for emerging security challenges, said on Friday
during the Defense One Tech Summit.]{.underline}** Much has changed
since NATO's most recent strategic concept document came out in 2010,
Van Weel said**[. Even before Russia launched a brutal war on the
alliance's doorstep, its members had growing concern about China's rise,
its influence over emerging technology, and its outsized share of the
world's electronics supply. The new concept will reflect the fact that
future threats to alliance members won't be purely
military.]{.underline}** "Supply chain was not an issue 10 years ago. We
were still globalizing. We were working on the basis of just-in-time,
just-enough logistic routes. And now we\'ve seen with the pandemic, with
the economic vision that China tends to use against countries or the
fact that a simple container vessel can get stuck in the Suez Canal for
two weeks, how fragile we are," he said. "Safety and security is much
more than building a border and having soldiers behind it. It\'s also
about being able to...look after yourself and be independent." While the
strategic concept will bring new emphasis to non-military threats, it
won't short-change military deterrence, a need dramatically demonstrated
by the ongoing Russian war on Ukraine. "I don\'t think it\'s either/or.
We see now in Ukraine that what they need, mostly, now in order to stop
the advancements of Russia in the Donbas is heavy artillery. And I think
many people would have said two years ago that heavy artillery is
probably not something we\'ll see in a conflict in the near future in
Europe," Van Weel said. "So we shouldn\'t be quickly drawing conclusions
on what means are obsolete, or needed. But I think it is safe to say
that **[in addition to that classical military deterrence and defense,
there is an aspect to deterrence and defense that needs to take into
account all these other \[things\]]{.underline}** whether they are in
energy supplies, supply chains, **[cyber, or in innovation and
technology that can be used against us.]{.underline}** "I\'m pretty
confident that **[all these aspects will feature prominently in the new

#### Strategic Concept will already include a focus on emerging tech -- link is non-unique

**[Emerging and disruptive technologies will be a key focus area of
NATO's new Strategic Concept]{.underline}** which will be unveiled later
this month, the U.S. ambassador to the alliance told reporters
Wednesday. The document is expected to be adopted at the upcoming NATO
summit in Madrid, marking the first time in more than a decade that the
transatlantic military pact has released a new Strategic Concept. The
guidance sets the alliance's strategy and security tasks, outlines the
challenges and opportunities it faces in a changing security
environment, and provides direction for its political and military
implementation. **[There will be "a lot on new threats and challenges, a
heavier emphasis on things like emerging and disruptive technologies,
heavier emphasis on new domains like cybe]{.underline}**r and space,
more on climate change," U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told the
Defense Writers Group in Washington. Smith did not elaborate on what the
emerging technologies are, and FedScoop did not have the opportunity to
ask her about them before the meeting with reporters ended. However**[,
individual members of NATO have already their signaled interest and
concerns about unmanned systems, AI, autonomy and hypersonics, among
other emerging capabilities]{.underline}**. For example, last week
senior Pentagon officials and their U.K. counterparts signed an
Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Statement of Intent, setting shared
strategic objectives related to AI readiness. **[The agreement "will
deepen AI cooperation between the two Allies, maintaining and increasing
interoperability and promoting values-based global leadership for the
responsible development, procurement, and use of AI in
defense]{.underline}**," according to a DOD news release. Non-NATO
members from the Asia-Pacific region will also be attending the summit
for the first time, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South
Korea. The threat posed by Russia and China will be addressed during
discussions and in the new Strategic Concept. At the meeting leaders
will have an opportunity "to have a conversation about what we're both
seeing. It's been interesting for me to watch, say, countries in the
Asia-Pacific talk about **[hybrid threats]{.underline}** on their side
of the Pacific, how are they grappling with **[disinformation,
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, the aggressive tactics that they're seeing,
acts of intimidation from China. And then you pair that with an Estonian
or a Lithuanian and they talk about some of the challenges that they're
seeing from Russia," Smith said. "It's about sharing lessons learned,
sharing new policies that we're developing. We've had a number of
conversations about emerging and disruptive technologies \[and\] how are
we grappling with that," she added. Other topics expected to be
discussed at the confab include NATO's force posture in Eastern Europe,
and Sweden and Finland's plans to join the alliance.

#### Emerging tech/AI focus within NATO is happening now -- codifying and enhancing it through the Strategic Concept is necessary to combat rising hybrid threats and build multinational capacity for resilience.

Concept Must Enhance Digital Access and Capacities,\" Just Security,

This month in Madrid, **[the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
will update its Strategic Concept,]{.underline}** the principal document
that guides the alliance's political-military strategy and collective
defense operations. The war in Ukraine has put resilience in the face of
Russian aggression front and center, especially in the cyber and
information operation domains. Over the years, NATO has digitized and
enhanced its security platforms, emphasizing interoperability of systems
among its now 30 current member states. **[If NATO is to become more
resilient against advanced persistent threats, hackers, and the maligned
states that sponsor them, then the 2022 Strategic Concept must infuse
multinational warfighting and deterrence against hybrid threats with
methods that facilitate access to data and information sharing on its
platforms and across multiple domains]{.underline}**, namely in air,
**[cyber]{.underline}**, **[information]{.underline}**, land, maritime,
and space **[operations.]{.underline}** The 2022 Strategic Concept The
Strategic Concept is among NATO's most important documents as it informs
alliance planning, resource allocation, and programming based on changes
in the threat environment. But the document has not been updated since
2010. The 2010 Strategic Concept, entitled "Active engagement, Modern
Defense," contained just one brief sentence about cyber attacks and did
not even mention China. It also stated that "Today, the Euro-Atlantic
area is at peace," even though Russia had invaded Georgia two years
before and the threat of a return to great power competition loomed. To
argue that a lot has happened between 2010 and 2022 would be an
understatement. Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in the
Donbas in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered any
illusions of a lasting peace with Russia. China's territorial ambitions,
economic assertiveness, threats against Taiwan, and military
modernization threaten the rules-based order**[. Emerging technologies
-- in the form of hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, and machine learning -- have intensified great power
competition. The 2022 Strategic Concept should highlight the essential
role of technology in collective defense. To build greater digital
capacity while also emphasizing resilience, NATO must adopt a new
technological orientation on the military strategic level of
command,]{.underline}** especially within the Allied Command
Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia and the Allied Command
Operations (ACO) in Mons, Belgium. ACT leverages advanced technologies
for security and defense in capabilities, procedures, public-private
partnerships, civil-military relations, and at NATO's Centers of
Excellence. Led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, ACO is
responsible for collective defense through direction, requirements,
planning, and execution at the strategic level. However, the Strategic
Concept 2022 should focus less on the emergence of new technologies and
more on how NATO's military and civilian personnel use them. **[ACO and
ACT must emphasize greater accessibility to information and data for its
multinational warfighters, cyber operators, and civilian professionals.
NATO must reach out to experts in the private sector, academia, and
non-governmental organizations to harness ways to expand access and
emphasize flexibility in multi-domain operations.]{.underline}** NATO
can do this by providing more grants to private sector partners and
establish a new center of excellence on data and information sharing.
**[ACO and ACT should also enable personnel and partners to readily
access data and information in DIMEL domains: diplomatic,
information/cyber, military, economic, and legal]{.underline}**. This
would expand the range of measures needed by ACT and ACO to connect and
correlate deterrence with evolving hybrid threats**[. To deter hybrid
threats across multiple domains, with enhanced access on different
digital platforms, NATO members should develop smarter and lethal
capabilities to confront threats from state and non-state actors. This
would allow ACT and ACO to prepare for any contingency and respond to
adversaries in battlefields and battlespaces.]{.underline}** Plug and
Play The 2022 Strategic Concept encourages collaboration in the
implementation of guidelines and procedures through a "plug-and-play"
concept, in which platforms and systems are optimized for readiness and
response at lightning speed. Plug-and-play is based on approaches used
in commercial software that allow for innovation and easy access to
networks and systems through secure platforms. The NATO School
Oberammergau should offer platform training and education courses
programs in mobile access for ACT and ACO personnel with appropriate
security clearances. This would allow them to access the appropriate
platform and utilize data and information necessary for their tasks and
responsibilities. For example, NATO's Small Arms and Light Weapons
(SALW) and Mine Action (MA) Information Sharing Platform contains rich
and publicly available datasets on the roles played by the alliance in
mitigating the illicit trade in small arms, tanks, aircraft, and naval
vessels. It reports and updates NATO-funded projects to prevent
adversaries from acquiring these weapons. However, the SALW-MA platform
is outdated and not user friendly, impeding its functionality in
practice. Put simply, NATO's ACT and ACO should focus as much on easing
access to information as it does on advanced technologies and
conventional weaponry. This would provide NATO with useful tools to
access data and intelligence on the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels and in land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains using devices and
platforms that can seamlessly connect in different locations. But NATO
Commands cannot simply expect its existing personnel to adapt. They must
be trained and educated on a regular basis to use digital
infrastructures in ways that make their jobs easier. **[On the strategic
level, the 2022 Strategic Concept must provide NATO's political and
military leaders with flexibility and resources to discern the diversity
of hybrid threats in the environment]{.underline}**. NATO's strategic
planners, cyber operators, and warfighters should be trained and
educated in relevant digital platforms, access, and sharing data and
information in ways that improve collaborative decision-making and
collective defense. On the operations level, personnel must be given
enough space to share data and intelligence as well as to train tactical
level personnel on software that enables them to collect, analyze,
process, and disseminate information quickly and easily across multiple
domains. **[Addressing these challenges is difficult for just one
nation-state, let alone for all 30 NATO members. Therefore, the 2022
Strategic Concept should emphasize connectivity between member states in
multi-domain operations]{.underline}** and in collaboration with the
private sector and academia. Accessibility to information and data
sharing among NATO members should be securitized and harmonized.
Essential Role of Artificial Intelligence The challenge for NATO is not
necessarily adopting and investing in emerging and disrupting
technologies for collective defense. Rather, the question is whether
**[ACT and ACO can enhance accessibility to digital platforms and ease
communications between platforms. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) can
play a role in overcoming critical obstacles. AI is now occupying a
greater space in NATO's collective defense orientation. The challenge in
the 2022 Strategic Concept will be delineating the degree to which AI
will enhance the ability of the alliance to analyze information and
assess data.]{.underline}** Moreover, AI is only as good as the data it
relies on. To maintain its technological edge, in 2021 **[NATO released
an Artificial Intelligence Strategy,]{.underline}** a good step toward
maximizing interoperability of weapons systems, improving
infrastructure, and building resilient hybrid defenses. While it
emphasizes collaboration with the private sector and academia, **[the
strategy needs further refinement as AI would help NATO's military and
civilian personnel interlink devices on different platforms, perform
rigorous data analytics, and quicken response time in response to a
conventional or hybrid attack. One innovation is the Defence Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA).]{.underline}** DIANA
leverages partnerships among academics, technology companies, start-up
firms to address the full spectrum of threats in the security
environment. Private sector firms utilizing DIANA can access innovation
sites and test centers that focus on artificial intelligence, machine
learning, quantum computing, autonomous machines, and biotechnology. In
the past, alliance members supported the creation and development of a
venture capital Innovation Fund for technology companies and start-ups.
**[The Strategic Concept should support the initiative with sustained
public funds in ways that allow for strategic-level planning at ACO and
ATO to communicate more effectively at the operational and tactical
levels. DIANA and the Innovation Fund are models for the
alliance.]{.underline}** An existing partnership that is proving
effective is NATO's collaboration with Klarrio, a firm that provides the
alliance with innovative real-time data analytics and streaming services
to combat disinformation and fake news. Klarrio has partnered with
NATO's Strategic Communications Center (StratCom) to assist the alliance
in the information domain by streaming data analysis, processing, and
applications analytics to identify and eradicate disinformation for
NATO's strategic-level planners. It supports and updates dashboard
services to track suspicious activities in social media platforms,
maintains an interactive user interface, generates analytical reports,
and uses machine learning to analyze data and information.

Why is Nato not doing more? Taken together, **[all the

Initially backing Ukraine, albeit at arm's length, gave Nato a boost.
Its stock rose from the low-point of [last year's Afghan withdrawal
debacle](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/26/nato-was-a-political-failure-in-afghanistan-says-defence-secretary).

But if, as expected, the war grinds on, if both sides grow desperate, if
the diplomatic impasse deepens, and if the threat of wider conflict
rises, Nato's long unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities will
become both more obvious and more hazardous for those crouching behind
its battlements. Its post-Soviet bluff may finally be called.

It would be unrealistic to expect seamless political unanimity in so
large an organisation. But **[the fact that each member]{.underline}**

Nothing in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get clear
answers. For starters, **[the 30-strong alliance is
unwieldy]{.underline}**. In military terms, only a handful of members
matter---above all, the United States---but in political terms, even
little Luxembourg and Iceland get a voice. Worse, **[the
political]{.underline}** **[divides are huge]{.underline}**.
**[Turkey]{.underline}** **[under]{.underline}** President Recep Tayyip
**[Erdogan]{.underline}** **[is a semi-authoritarian]{.underline}**

**[constant obstacles]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[distractions]{.underline}**. The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious
display since the start of the war, have already enriched the
language: [Scholzen](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scholzen) is a German
neologism for "dither,"
while [makronic](https://polishnews.co.uk/the-word-makronic-in-ukrainian-a-reference-to-the-attitude-of-emmanuel-macron/) in
Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as
"vacuous grandstanding while doing nothing."

Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a big question mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.
**[Any threat or provocation]{.underline}** **[from
Russia]{.underline}** **[is unlikely to be clear or conveniently
timed]{.underline}**. **[More likely it will]{.underline}**
**[be]{.underline}** **[something deliberately ambiguous]{.underline}**,
such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the territory of
a front-line state and hits a target. **[Some countries would favor a
tough response.]{.underline}** **[Others would fear escalation and want
dialogue]{.underline}**. Still **[others would take the ambiguity as a
convenient excuse to do nothing]{.underline}**. Would the 30---soon to

diplomacy, and compromise. **[Those actually facing the]{.underline}**

Paul **Antonopoulos 21**, PhD Candidate at Vila Velha University, "2021:
A year of NATO disunity like no other,"
<https://infobrics.org/post/34879/pairie+micahw>

**[2021]{.underline}** **[is arguably the year when]{.underline}**
**[intra-NATO tensions]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[rivalry]{.underline}** **[widened]{.underline}** **[more so then
ever]{.underline}** **[since the alliance\'s inception in
1949]{.underline}**. Although NATO most recently expanded its membership
to include Montenegro in 2017 and North Macedonia in 2020, **[the rift
caused by]{.underline}** **[competing interests]{.underline}** **[and
the]{.underline}** **[emboldening]{.underline}** **[of revisionist
ideologies]{.underline}** (neo-Ottomanism and Anglo Chauvinism) **[among
bloc members has]{.underline}** **[only widened]{.underline}** **[in
recent years]{.underline}**, but no other like 2021.

**[Intense NATO]{.underline}** **[disunity]{.underline}** first
**[became prevalent during the]{.underline}** **[Syrian
War]{.underline}**. **[Turkey]{.underline}** **[continues to
be]{.underline}** **[enraged]{.underline}** **[that the]{.underline}**
**[US]{.underline}**, **[France]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[other member states]{.underline}** **[train]{.underline}**, **[fund
and arm the]{.underline}** People's Protection Units
(**[YPG]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** **[Syrian
branch]{.underline}** **[of the]{.underline}** Kurdistan Workers Party
(**[PKK]{.underline}**) **[that Ankara recognizes as a]{.underline}**
**[terrorist organization]{.underline}**. Meanwhile,
**[Washington]{.underline}** **[is furious that]{.underline}**
**[Turkey]{.underline}** **[defied warnings to]{.underline}** **[not
purchase]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[Russian-made
S-400]{.underline}** **[missile defense system]{.underline}**, **[and
thus in]{.underline}** December **[2020]{.underline}** **[imposed
sanctions on its fellow NATO member]{.underline}**, **[an]{.underline}**
**[unprecedented action]{.underline}**. **[With]{.underline}** former US
President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** **[unwilling to]{.underline}**
**[confront Turkey]{.underline}** **[in a]{.underline}** **[serious
way]{.underline}** **[in order to]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}**
**[jeopardize his personal business interests in the
country]{.underline}**, his successor Joe **[Biden]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** **[more willingly confronted]{.underline}** his
Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan]{.underline}**.

On Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day (April 24, 2021),
**[Biden]{.underline}** **[recognized the]{.underline}**
Turkish-perpetrated **[Armenian Genocide]{.underline}**, **[something
successive presidents]{.underline}** **[refused to do]{.underline}**
**[out of fear of]{.underline}** **[alienating]{.underline}** **[a
Turkey that was once seen as a]{.underline}** **[bulwark]{.underline}**
**[against the Soviet Union/Russian Federation]{.underline}**. Seeing as
the previous non-recognition of the genocide was for political and
geopolitical reasons, **[the recognition signifies a]{.underline}**
**[major change]{.underline}** **[in Washington's attitude towards
Ankara]{.underline}**.

Although **[Washington]{.underline}** **[bemoans Ankara as being
revisionist]{.underline}**, **[its]{.underline}** **[own contradictory
revisionism]{.underline}** actually **[caused]{.underline}** a **[deeper
disunity]{.underline}** **[among NATO members in 2021]{.underline}**
**[following]{.underline}** the announcement of **[AUKUS]{.underline}**,
a trilateral Anglo security pact between Australia, the UK and the US.
**[Under the pact]{.underline}**, **[the US will share]{.underline}**
**[nuclear propulsion technology with Australia]{.underline}**. **[This
culminated in Canberra]{.underline}** **[cancelling]{.underline}**
without notice **[the]{.underline}** **[French--Australian submarine
deal]{.underline}** worth €56 billion, **[ending efforts]{.underline}**
**[for the two countries to develop a]{.underline}** **[deeper strategic
partnership]{.underline}**.

**[The]{.underline}** **[sudden cancellation]{.underline}** **[of a
lucrative contract]{.underline}** and defense strategy **[with Australia
was a]{.underline}** **[humiliation]{.underline}** **[for Paris as its
ambitions for]{.underline}** **[more global influence]{.underline}**
**[was dealt a blow]{.underline}**. The French Ambassadors to Washington
and Canberra were recalled to Paris, and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le
Drian said "With Britain, there is no need. We know their constant
opportunism."

**[Washington pleaded to Paris that it had no knowledge that Canberra
was about to]{.underline}** "**[backstab]{.underline}**", as Le Drian
termed it, **[their planned strategic alliance]{.underline}**. **[The
UK's]{.underline}** post-**[Brexit]{.underline}** Anglo Chauvinistic
**[ideology]{.underline}**, **[something that Canberra naturally aligns
with]{.underline}**, **[motivated the]{.underline}** **[humiliating
manner]{.underline}** **[in which France was sidelined to make way for
AUKUS]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** **[total
disregard]{.underline}** **[for French industry and strategic interests
made Paris]{.underline}** **[lose trust in NATO]{.underline}**.

**[This]{.underline}** "**[backstab]{.underline}**"
**[spurred]{.underline}** on **[Paris to seek greater strategic
alliances]{.underline}** **[at a]{.underline}** **[bilateral
level]{.underline}**, **[leading to a mutual defense pact
that]{.underline}** **[supersedes NATO]{.underline}** **[with
Greece]{.underline}**. Greece is also **[frustrated]{.underline}**
**[with NATO as]{.underline}** **[daily Turkish
violations]{.underline}** **[against its airspace]{.underline}**,
Turkish **[threats of a]{.underline}** **[casus belli]{.underline}**
**[if it expands its maritime zone]{.underline}** in the Aegean Sea to
12 nautical miles from its six (as permitted by international law),
**[and Turkish attempts to]{.underline}** **[exploit energy
deposits]{.underline}** **[in Greece's maritime space]{.underline}**,
**[is]{.underline}** **[met with indifference]{.underline}**. In this
way, **[Athens]{.underline}** **[lost trust]{.underline}** **[in NATO as
a peace guarantor]{.underline}**, something that made its pact with
France a security necessity.

The **[Biden]{.underline}** administration **[praised
what]{.underline}** Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
**[Mitsotakis]{.underline}** **[termed as]{.underline}** "**[strategic
autonomy]{.underline}**" **[from Washington]{.underline}**, **[a minor
concession likely to try and appease Paris as it lost its more lucrative
agreement with Australia]{.underline}**. However,
**[Ankara]{.underline}** **[continually berates]{.underline}** **[the
French-Greek pact]{.underline}**, with Turkish Defense Minister
**[Hulusi Akar]{.underline}** **[saying that Greece's alliance with
France will cause]{.underline}** **[cracks in NATO]{.underline}**. **[On
another occasion he said]{.underline}** "\[**[Greece is]{.underline}**\]
**[trying to]{.underline}** **[overpower Turkey]{.underline}** **[with
armaments and challenges]{.underline}**, in cooperation with some other
countries," an indirect reference to France. Akar added: "\[Greece\] has
different ambitions that it seeks to achieve through other alliances."

**[There is]{.underline}** **[clearly]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**
**[major breakdown]{.underline}** **[in NATO unity as accusations are
being made between member states on who is responsible for causing
cracks]{.underline}**. T**[his comes as the US]{.underline}**
**[continues to expect]{.underline}** all **[member states to be
compliant]{.underline}**, **[as the UK]{.underline}** **[retracts to
Anglo Chauvinism under the guise of]{.underline}** "**[Global
Britain]{.underline}**", **[as]{.underline}** **[France]{.underline}**
**[attempts to have more international influence]{.underline}**, **[and
as]{.underline}** **[Turkey]{.underline}** more **[aggressively pursues
a]{.underline}** **[neo-Ottoman]{.underline}** **[policy]{.underline}**.

[2021 saw]{.underline} **[Greece]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[France]{.underline}** **[lose trust in NATO]{.underline}**, Turkey
accuse Greece of causing disunity, the US angered as Turkey announces it
wants to purchase another S-400 unit from Russia, [and the]{.underline}
formation of an **[Anglo bloc]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
seemingly **[supersedes]{.underline}** [NATO and French
interests]{.underline}. [Throw into this quagmire the]{.underline}
**[massive disparity]{.underline}** [of interest among NATO members to
support]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}** against Russia, [and it
appears that the bloc is disunited]{.underline} **[like never
before]{.underline}**.

[These events suggests that]{.underline} **[2021]{.underline}** [is a
year where NATO's]{.underline} **[fragility and disunity]{.underline}**
[was]{.underline} **[more apparent]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
**[any other year]{.underline}**, especially in the post-Cold War
period. [With these tensions]{.underline}, particular as the Anglo bloc
and Turkey pursue revisionist policies and ideologies, [disunity within
NATO will]{.underline} **[not only continue]{.underline}** [into
2022]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} **[intensify]{.underline}**.

### Non-UQ \-\-- No Cohesion

#### NATOs strategic concept is failing now -- cohesion is dead and its super overstretched.

While many allies have stepped up, **[important European Nato members
cower behind an alliance they previously disparaged and neglected. They
use it to avoid making costly national commitments to Kyiv that might
anger Moscow. Daydreaming]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** EU
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}**, France's Emmanuel **[Macron
prefers talk to action]{.underline}**. **[Germany's Olaf Scholz
epitomises dither and delay.]{.underline}** **[Viktor
Orbán]{.underline}**, Hungary's sanctions-busting prime minister,
**[often seems to bat for the other side. Cynically self-serving
attempts by Turkey]{.underline}**'s troublemaker president, Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan**[, to sabotage Finland and Sweden's membership applications
also undermine a united front.]{.underline}** Jens **[Stoltenberg,
Nato's]{.underline}** inoffensive **[secretary general, will struggle to
repair these fissures.]{.underline}** Poland and other "frontline"
states want a tougher approach, including permanent positioning of
additional troops, heavy weapons and planes on Russia's borders. In
response, Nato officials promise "robust and historic" decisions. As for
Ukraine, its leadership has all but abandoned hopes of membership,
solemnly promised at Nato's 2008 Bucharest summit, and has ceased
calling for direct military intervention. "Of course, we will hear words
of support... we are very grateful for that," said its foreign minister,
Dmytro Kuleba. Having previously accused Nato of "doing nothing", he
does not expect concrete action in Madrid on accession or, for example,
"Black Sea security". That last remark referred to the unforgivable,
ongoing US-European failure to challenge Moscow's illegal blockade of
Ukraine's ports, which is creating global food shortages. Nato could and
should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so helping
persuade Putin to end his genocidal war It's one of many areas where
Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so
helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war. **[Why is Nato not
doing more? Taken together, all the rationales and excuses for passivity
and inaction produce a picture of an alliance significantly less united,
powerful and organised than its admirers pretend. Initially backing
Ukraine, albeit at arm's length, gave Nato a boost. Its stock rose from
the low-point of last year's Afghan withdrawal debacle. But if, as
expected, the war grinds on, if both sides grow desperate, if the
diplomatic impasse deepens, and if the threat of wider conflict rises,
Nato's long unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities will become both
more obvious and more hazardous for those crouching behind its
battlements. Its post-Soviet bluff may finally be called.]{.underline}**
It would be unrealistic to expect seamless political unanimity in so
large an organisation. But **[the fact that each member has an equal say
when, in terms of military capacity, they are absurdly unequal, hinders
swift, bold decision-making.]{.underline}** A Russian nuclear or
chemical provocation, for example, would be likely to produce a
paralysing cacophony of conflicting voices within Nato -- and Putin
surely knows it. At the same time, **[there is huge over-reliance on the
US, a military superpower without whose agreement nothing happens and
behind whose might the laggards lurk, refusing to pay their
way]{.underline}**. **[Organisationally and militarily]{.underline}**,
too, **[Nato is all over the place]{.underline}**. It has three joint
command headquarters -- in Italy, the Netherlands and the US. But its
top general is based in Belgium. **[Inter-operability of different
countries' weapons systems is lacking, as are joint training exercises,
arms procurement and intelligence-sharing. Nato is also increasingly
overstretched]{.underline}**, **[caught between a Russian threat in the
Euro-Atlantic area and challenges in the Indo-Pacific from an
aggressively expansionist China.]{.underline}** Leaders from Japan,
South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are expected in Madrid. Their
shared nightmare: a "no limits" totalitarian Sino-Russian global axis
with echoes of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact. **[Nato is due to publish its
10-yearly "strategic concept" on how to deal with all this, plus
trans-national terrorism, destabilising climate change, cyber warfare
and the rise of anti-democratic states. It's a tall
order.]{.underline}**

### Non-UQ \-\-- No Cohesion (Turkey)

#### Turkey does a little trolling.

**[Turkey Is a Disruptive Ally]{.underline}**,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/turkey-nato-russia.html/micahw

WASHINGTON --- **[When]{.underline}** President Recep Tayyip
**[Erdogan]{.underline}** of Turkey **[threatened this month to
block]{.underline}** **[NATO membership for Finland and
Sweden]{.underline}**, **[Western officials were]{.underline}**
**[exasperated]{.underline}** --- **[but]{.underline}** **[not
shocked]{.underline}**.

**[Within an alliance that operates by consensus]{.underline}**, **[the
Turkish strongman has come to be]{.underline}** seen as something of
**[a]{.underline}** **[stickup artist]{.underline}**. **[In
2009]{.underline}**, **[he]{.underline}** **[blocked]{.underline}**
**[the appointment of a new NATO chief from Denmark]{.underline}**,
complaining that the country was too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet
Muhammad and too sympathetic to "Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey.
**[It took]{.underline}** **[hours of cajoling]{.underline}** **[by
Western leaders]{.underline}**, **[and a]{.underline}** **[face-to-face
promise]{.underline}** **[from]{.underline}** President Barack
**[Obama]{.underline}** **[that NATO would appoint a Turk]{.underline}**
**[to a leadership position]{.underline}**, **[to satisfy]{.underline}**
Mr. **[Erdogan]{.underline}**.

After a rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel the next year,
Mr. **[Erdogan]{.underline}** **[prevented]{.underline}** **[the
alliance from working with the Jewish state for]{.underline}** **[six
years]{.underline}**. A few years later, Mr. **[Erdogan]{.underline}**
**[delayed]{.underline}** **[for months]{.underline}** **[a NATO plan to
fortify Eastern European countries against]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}**, again **[citing]{.underline}** **[Kurdish
militants]{.underline}** **[and demanding that the alliance declare ones
operating in Syria to be]{.underline}** **[terrorists]{.underline}**. In
2020, Mr. **[Erdogan sent a]{.underline}** **[gas-exploration
ship]{.underline}** backed by fighter jets **[close to Greek
waters]{.underline}**, **[causing France to send ships in]{.underline}**
**[support of Greece]{.underline}**, also a NATO member.

Now **[the Turkish leader is]{.underline}** **[back]{.underline}** **[in
the role of]{.underline}** **[obstructionist]{.underline}**, **[and is
once again invoking the Kurds]{.underline}**, as he charges that Sweden
and Finland sympathize with the Kurdish militants he has made his main
enemy.

"These countries have almost become guesthouses for terrorist
organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us to be in
favor."

Mr. **[Erdogan's stance is a reminder]{.underline}** **[of
a]{.underline}** **[long-festering problem]{.underline}** **[for
NATO]{.underline}**, which currently has 30 members. **[Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}** **[may have]{.underline}** **[given
the alliance a new sense of mission]{.underline}**, **[but NATO
must]{.underline}** **[still contend]{.underline}** **[with an
authoritarian leader]{.underline}** **[willing]{.underline}** **[to use
his leverage to]{.underline}** **[gain political points at
home]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}** **[blocking
consensus]{.underline}** --- at least **[for a time]{.underline}**.

#### Greece [hates]{.underline} Turkey's guts.

Anthee **Carassava 22**, Senior International Journalist at The Times,
"Greek Forces on High Alert over Crisis with Turkey,"
https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-forces-on-high-alert-over-crisis-with-turkey/6598746.html/micahw

**[Greece's armed forces are on]{.underline}** **[high
alert]{.underline}** **[in the Eastern Aegean Sea as tensions escalate
with Turkey]{.underline}**. **[Officials have been responding
to]{.underline}** what they say are **[mounting
provocations]{.underline}** **[by Turkey's leadership]{.underline}**.

**[Senior Greek Defense Ministry sources]{.underline}** **[say the
military intelligence they have gathered point to the prospect
of]{.underline}** so-called **[hybrid threats]{.underline}** **[that
Greece]{.underline}** may **[face from]{.underline}** its neighbor
**[Turkey as the two NATO allies]{.underline}** **[compete for oil and
gas drilling rights in]{.underline}** contested parts of
**[the]{.underline}** **[Aegean]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[Mediterranean seas]{.underline}**.

The **[points of friction between the two countries are]{.underline}**
**[many]{.underline}**.

A **[crisis]{.underline}**, the sources say, **[may]{.underline}** also
**[spring from a]{.underline}** **[sudden surge in refugee flows from
Turkey]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}** from **[unexpected
wildfires]{.underline}** **[in remote locations or islands in the Aegean
Sea that Turkey wants to see]{.underline}**
**[demilitarized]{.underline}**.

Some **[security analysts say that]{.underline}** while **[Turkey's
recent actions]{.underline}** -- including the bellicose remarks of its
leader -- **[are]{.underline}** **[serious]{.underline}**, an **[armed
conflict is unlikely]{.underline}**. Retired General Leonidas Tzoumis
said both countries stand to lose from a military confrontation, but he
warned that **[Turkish actions may lead to]{.underline}** a
**[miscalculation]{.underline}**. **[That prospect]{.underline}**, he
said, **[requires]{.underline}** **[heightened vigilance]{.underline}**
**[by Greece\'s armed forces]{.underline}**.

Tzoumis said **[Greece is facing]{.underline}** what he calls a
**[classic Turkish game of]{.underline}** **[controlled
escalation]{.underline}**, one **[of]{.underline}** **[repeated
provocations]{.underline}** **[that can trigger a]{.underline}**
**[serious enough incident]{.underline}** **[that would eventually force
Greece to negotiate matters like the Aegean Sea dispute and territorial
rights that Greece has been refusing to discuss because]{.underline}**
-- the analyst said - **[it does not want to]{.underline}** **[cede an
inch]{.underline}**.

**[Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades]{.underline}** over
rights to the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean. **[They are also locked
in a]{.underline}** **[fierce arms race]{.underline}** **[that has them
spending]{.underline}** among **[the]{.underline}** **[highest
amounts]{.underline}** **[in defense compared to other NATO member
states]{.underline}**.

Turkey has the second largest army in the NATO alliance.

**[U.S. reluctance is blocking Ankara]{.underline}** **[from
obtaining]{.underline}** a fresh batch of American-made **[F-16 fighter
jets it needs to crush Kurdish separatists in its north]{.underline}**.
Some **[officials]{.underline}** **[in the United States and western
Europe have voiced]{.underline}** **[concerns]{.underline}** **[that a
rearmed Turkey]{.underline}** could pose a threat to Greece and others
in the region.

Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdogan]{.underline}**
**[said he was]{.underline}** **[cutting off all contact]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}** Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
**[Mitsotakis]{.underline}** **[because of an address the Greek leader
made to the U.S. Congress]{.underline}**, **[urging it to keep blocking
the sale]{.underline}**.

**[Mitsotakis]{.underline}** also **[sealed a deal for F-35 fighter
jets]{.underline}**, **[dashing]{.underline}** **[hopes of a détente in
relations with Turkey]{.underline}**, despite a March meeting with
Erdogan **[in which the two men agreed to avoid]{.underline}**
"provocations" **[as]{.underline}** the war in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**
**[rages]{.underline}**.

**[Turkey has]{.underline}** **[since]{.underline}** **[carried out what
Greek officials say is an unprecedented surge]{.underline}** **[in
violations of Greek airspace]{.underline}**. **[Refugee flows
are]{.underline}** **[spiking]{.underline}** again. **[Turkey has
recently sent out an exploratory vessel to the Aegean]{.underline}**.
This week, **[Ankara]{.underline}** **[openly contested]{.underline}**
**[Greek sovereignty over 23 islands]{.underline}**, **[many of them
populated and some of them tourist destinations favored by Americans and
Europeans]{.underline}**.

Mitsotakis warns that **[any serious threat from Turkey will not go
unanswered]{.underline}**. **[In a bid to rally European
support]{.underline}**, **[he has been meeting key European
leaders]{.underline}**, **[presenting them with]{.underline}** the
**[worrying intelligence report]{.underline}** **[and a list of what
Greece considers Turkish provocations]{.underline}**.

In remarks Tuesday at a news conference, **[Mitsotakis said he
was]{.underline}** -- in his words - **[not interested]{.underline}**
**[in]{.underline}** **[psychoanalyzing]{.underline}** **[Turkey's
behavior]{.underline}**, **[nor would he engage in]{.underline}** what
he called '**[this play of bellicose remarks]{.underline}**.' **[But
Mitsotakis told reporters provocations will not and should not be
tolerated]{.underline}**, **[especially from a country that says it
wants to join the European Union]{.underline}**.

Mitsotakis said **[he would push his EU counterparts to issue a strong
protest against Turkey]{.underline}** when they meet at a summit in late
June.

Until then, **[military officials warn]{.underline}**, **[Greece's armed
forces will continue to remain on alert]{.underline}**.

**[Turkey is walking a]{.underline}** **[narrow line]{.underline}**. For
now, **[NATO states are]{.underline}** **[acting]{.underline}** **[as if
these difficulties will be settled]{.underline}**. Turkey has a right to
raise its concerns. Finland and Sweden have a right to explain their
views. **[Delaying the membership process]{.underline}** too long
**[could]{.underline}** **[escalate]{.underline}** **[the level of

Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdogan]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** **[doubled down]{.underline}** **[on his
opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the NATO
alliance]{.underline}**, **[a move that would be]{.underline}**
**[historic]{.underline}** **[for the two Nordic countries in the wake
of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**.

\"**[We will not say \'yes\' to those]{.underline}**
\[**[countries]{.underline}**\] **[who apply sanctions to Turkey to join
security organization NATO]{.underline}**,\" **[Erdogan said at a news
conference late Monday]{.underline}**. He was referring to Sweden\'s

activities in Syria.

### Non-UQ \-\-- Concept broad now

**[The most substantive item on the agenda is an updating of Nato's key
Strategic Concept -- which sets the alliance's values and strategic
objectives for the next decade]{.underline}**. The current version,
adopted in 2010, has served Nato well -- but it was based on premises
that no longer apply. Then, the global war on terror and Nato's role in
expeditionary operations as far afield as Afghanistan were what
determined its purpose. Now, according to deputy secretary general
Mircea Geoană, speaking at a conference in Copenhagen on June 10, Nato
is more preoccupied with a new era of what he referred to as great power
competition -- focusing on Russia and China. It seems certain that a new
document will be adopted. Russian belligerence has helped forge
agreement, as has a growing appreciation of the "systemic challenges"
posed by China. **[The multiple challenges of Nato's security
environment mean the document will pay attention to many other issues.
Some will be quite separate from Russia and China -- climate change,
global health and terrorism]{.underline}** among them. But others --
**[hybrid and asymmetric threats, the militarisation of space, cyber
security and the geostrategic importance of the Arctic and the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}** -- will be intimately connected to
calculations concerning Moscow and Beijing.

#### Non unique -- its already expanding to cyberattacks, China, and adding new members.

Even as a war rages in its own backyard, **[NATO will use its highly
anticipated summit later this month to look beyond the concerns of the
moment and address the threat posed by China for the first time in a
major document]{.underline}**, a top American official told reporters on
Wednesday. **[Much of the conversation]{.underline}** at the **[upcoming
summit in Madrid is]{.underline}** still **[expected to focus on
deterring Russia]{.underline}** **[amid its invasion of Ukraine and
considering the applications from Finland and Sweden to join the
alliance]{.underline}**. But the strategic concept to be unveiled at the
summit must encompass the next decade, which **[will see threats from
China and emerging technology such as cyber attacks]{.underline}**, said
Julianne Smith, the United States' permanent representative to NATO. "We
are largely in agreement that Russia is the preeminent challenge, the
primary threat that the NATO alliance is facing in this moment, and
because of that, you'll see a heavy emphasis on Russia right out of the
gates at the top," Smith said at an event hosted by the Defense Writers
Group. "There is also an appreciation across NATO that this document is
not intended to last for a week. This document...is supposed to last for
10 years." **[NATO's current strategic concept was released in 2010,
four years before Russia annexed Crimea and years before major cyber
attacks were commonplace]{.underline}**. The 36-page document does not
mention China; it also says the alliance seeks "a true strategic
partnership" and more cooperation with Russia. The new,
not-yet-finalized document set to be released in Spain will include the
first mention of China in a NATO strategic concept, Smith said---though
a statement released in June 2021 after an alliance summit in Brussels
said that China's "growing influence and international policies can
present challenges that we need to address together as an alliance."
NATO leaders are also expected to address cooperation between Russia and
China and how it affects the alliance, Smith said. NATO members have
been united in their condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
**[The alliance itself has provided no military support to Ukraine, a
non-member,]{.underline}** but many member countries, including the
United States, have shipped billions of dollars worth of arms to Kyiv in
addition to money for humanitarian aid and economic recovery. Besides
the long view of the strategic concept, Smith said, NATO leaders might
also release a communique or political declaration about the current
threat posed by Russia and the war in Ukraine. NATO, which includes
countries in Europe plus the United States and Canada, is seeking to
expand its relationships with governments outside the region, and has
invited leaders from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea to
attend the summit in Madrid, Smith said. **[Smith said there is no talk
of an Indo-Pacific-focused council within NATO, but added that bringing
in partners from the region can help share lessons about Chinese and
Russian cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.]{.underline}** "It's
been interesting for me to watch countries in the Asia-Pacific talk
about hybrid threats on their side of the Pacific...from China. Then you
pair that with an Estonian or a Lithuanian, and they talk about some of
the challenges that they're seeing from Russia," she said. One of the
biggest questions to be addressed at the summit is how many troops or
weapons NATO will position on its border with Russia in the medium and
long term, Smith said. NATO ramped up its presence on its eastern front
when the war in Ukraine began, but it's not clear how long those troops
will stay, or what the force posture will look like if the fighting
ends. **[There's also the question of whether Finland and Sweden, which
applied to join NATO last month, will be welcomed into the alliance by
the summit in late June amid Turkish opposition because of the Nordic
countries' views on terrorism.]{.underline}** NATO leader Jens
Stoltenberg said Wednesday that he will meet in "in the coming days" in
Brussels with senior officials from Turkey, Finland, and Sweden to
discuss Turkish concerns. "I'm confident that we will find a united way
forward," Stoltenberg said during a press conference at the State
Department.

### Non-UQ \-\-- No Coord Now

#### No coordination now \-\-- U.S. too unpredictable

Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis, "American Leadership
in NATO: A Rocky Return but a Firm Future," pg online @

// um-ef)

**[The concept is a guiding document]{.underline}**, now under
development, intended to revitalise NATO's purpose and core tasks for
the future. After former US President Donald Trump's and French
President Emmanuel Macron's respective accusations of NATO being
"obsolete" and "brain dead", the alliance is in grave need of a new
concept that brings the US and Europe together to tackle the security
challenges of today and tomorrow. The problem, however, is that **[the
two sides are not entirely coordinated]{.underline}** on how to do that.
Compared to the Trump era, **[divisions among the allies are not nearly
as evident]{.underline}**. **[But given Washington's growing focus on
the Indo-Pacific over Europe and flawed coordination efforts thus far,
its allies have some doubts about how America's intentions regarding
NATO will mesh with their own]{.underline}**. **[Europe,]{.underline}**
for its part, is in some ways stronger than ever---thanks to four years
of consolidating its own interests and capabilities in response to
growing US unpredictability. Now, it **[finds itself sometimes at odds
with Washington over key issues such as China]{.underline}**,
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}** **[and even
technology]{.underline}**. Simultaneously, it is more capable of
defending its positions. Given the domestic political volatility in the
**[US]{.underline}**, its **[allies are skeptical about what US
decisions will last through the next presidential
elections]{.underline}**. This means their own decisions matter even
more. All of these dynamics complicate the crafting of NATO's future
common agenda.

### Non-UQ \-\-- Cyber

#### The strategic concept will already discuss cyber.

**[Even before the Russian invasion, the Madrid Summit was poised to be
a game-changer for the alliance. The summit crown jewel was to be the
agreement on a new strategic concept for the alliance]{.underline}**.
Much has changed since the last time NATO leaders approved a strategic
concept in 2010. \"Even before February 24, there was a deep
appreciation across the alliance that the language on Russia from 2010
was sorely outdated and needed a significant upgrade and needed to
reflect the current environment,\" Smith said. \"**[There was also an
appreciation that China, for the first time, needed to be part of the
strategic concept.\"]{.underline}** In addition, **[the concept must
address new threats and challenges, including \"a heavier emphasis on
things like emerging and disruptive technologies, heavier emphasis on
new domains like cyber and space, \[and\] more on climate
change]{.underline}**,\" she said. And then, **[Russia]{.underline}**
again invaded its neighbor, which **[added new demands and complexities
to the summit. Now, there is a force-posture piece to discussions in
Madrid. The allies --- including the United States --- have sent
thousands of service members to the alliance\'s frontline states to
deter Putin]{.underline}**. The number of NATO battlegroups in those
states increased from four to eight. Biden has pledged to defend every
inch of NATO territory. The allies will discuss how the long-range
footprint of NATO forces in Europe should look. \"What over the medium-
and long-term should the alliance be looking to do in that neighborhood
to reinforce NATO\'s eastern flank?\" Smith asked. **[Another response
to the Russian invasion is applications by Sweden and Finland to join
the alliance]{.underline}**. The two nations, long NATO partners, have
military capabilities that would fit seamlessly into the alliance, Smith
said. \"The hope is that those two countries will join us in Madrid as
invitees,\" she said. **[China, too, is a concern. The foreign ministers
of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will join NATO leaders
in Madrid]{.underline}**. Smith believes **[this will broaden \"the
conversation]{.underline}** **[about our shared security, ... talking to
them about things like emerging and disruptive technologies and
cyber,\"]{.underline}** she said.

opportunity "to have a conversation about what we're both seeing. It's

talk about hybrid threats on their side of the Pacific, how are they
grappling with disinformation, cyberattacks, the aggressive tactics that
they're seeing, acts of intimidation from China. And then you pair that

added.

**[The new NATO Strategic Concept set to be unveiled later this month
will press alliance members to envision deterrence as a matter not just
of tanks and bombs but of]{.underline}** supply chain security,
**[cyberattacks,]{.underline}** climate change,
**[innovation,]{.underline}** and more. "**[The strategic concept needs
to be able to live for the next decade, so it looks far beyond the
current crisis in Ukraine. It looks at the implications
for]{.underline}** our security of...climate change, **[innovation, the
use of...hybrid warfare, cyber war and the role of cyber in our
societies]{.underline}**. But also resilience. **[How resilient are our
Western societies to these kind of attacks]{.underline}** and what do we
need to do in order to tackle that?" David van Weel, **[NATO's assistant
secretary general for emerging security challenges, said on Friday
during the Defense One Tech Summit.]{.underline}** Much has changed
since NATO's most recent strategic concept document came out in 2010,
Van Weel said**[. Even before Russia launched a brutal war on the
alliance's doorstep, its members had growing concern about China's rise,
its influence over emerging technology, and its outsized share of the
world's electronics supply. The new concept will reflect the fact that
future threats to alliance members won't be purely
military.]{.underline}** "Supply chain was not an issue 10 years ago. We
were still globalizing. We were working on the basis of just-in-time,
just-enough logistic routes. And now we\'ve seen with the pandemic, with
the economic vision that China tends to use against countries or the
fact that a simple container vessel can get stuck in the Suez Canal for
two weeks, how fragile we are," he said. "Safety and security is much
more than building a border and having soldiers behind it. It\'s also
about being able to...look after yourself and be independent." While the
strategic concept will bring new emphasis to non-military threats, it
won't short-change military deterrence, a need dramatically demonstrated
by the ongoing Russian war on Ukraine. "I don\'t think it\'s either/or.
We see now in Ukraine that what they need, mostly, now in order to stop
the advancements of Russia in the Donbas is heavy artillery. And I think
many people would have said two years ago that heavy artillery is
probably not something we\'ll see in a conflict in the near future in
Europe," Van Weel said. "So we shouldn\'t be quickly drawing conclusions
on what means are obsolete, or needed. But I think it is safe to say
that **[in addition to that classical military deterrence and defense,
there is an aspect to deterrence and defense that needs to take into
account all these other \[things\]]{.underline}** whether they are in
energy supplies, supply chains, **[cyber, or in innovation and
technology that can be used against us.]{.underline}** "I\'m pretty
confident that **[all these aspects will feature prominently in the new
strategic concept."]{.underline}**

British-made systems that provide ground troops with information on the

innovation]{.underline}**. "Ultimately, we hope that these
recommendations enable NATO allies to better innovate, scale, deploy,
and integrate AI and autonomy-based technologies to form agile,
system-wide solutions. NATO to test quantum and hypersonics NATO has
found itself on the ropes of late -- it's had to contend with Russia's
illegal invasion of Ukraine, increasing missile tests from a
rambunctious North Korea and the ever-growing technological might of
China. Last October, it signaled AI as a potentially game-changing
addition to its arsenal, with its members formally adopting an AI
strategy to try and maintain a technological edge against its
adversaries. **[That strategy includes plans to spend \$1 billion to
"futureproof" the security pact.]{.underline}** New test centers will

This month in Madrid, **[the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
will update its Strategic Concept,]{.underline}** the principal document
that guides the alliance's political-military strategy and collective
defense operations. The war in Ukraine has put resilience in the face of
Russian aggression front and center, especially in the cyber and
information operation domains. Over the years, NATO has digitized and
enhanced its security platforms, emphasizing interoperability of systems
among its now 30 current member states. **[If NATO is to become more
resilient against advanced persistent threats, hackers, and the maligned
states that sponsor them, then the 2022 Strategic Concept must infuse
multinational warfighting and deterrence against hybrid threats with
methods that facilitate access to data and information sharing on its
platforms and across multiple domains]{.underline}**, namely in air,
**[cyber]{.underline}**, **[information]{.underline}**, land, maritime,
and space **[operations.]{.underline}** The 2022 Strategic Concept The
Strategic Concept is among NATO's most important documents as it informs
alliance planning, resource allocation, and programming based on changes
in the threat environment. But the document has not been updated since
2010. The 2010 Strategic Concept, entitled "Active engagement, Modern
Defense," contained just one brief sentence about cyber attacks and did
not even mention China. It also stated that "Today, the Euro-Atlantic
area is at peace," even though Russia had invaded Georgia two years
before and the threat of a return to great power competition loomed. To
argue that a lot has happened between 2010 and 2022 would be an
understatement. Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in the
Donbas in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered any
illusions of a lasting peace with Russia. China's territorial ambitions,
economic assertiveness, threats against Taiwan, and military
modernization threaten the rules-based order**[. Emerging technologies
-- in the form of hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, and machine learning -- have intensified great power
competition. The 2022 Strategic Concept should highlight the essential
role of technology in collective defense. To build greater digital
capacity while also emphasizing resilience, NATO must adopt a new
technological orientation on the military strategic level of
command,]{.underline}** especially within the Allied Command
Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia and the Allied Command
Operations (ACO) in Mons, Belgium. ACT leverages advanced technologies
for security and defense in capabilities, procedures, public-private
partnerships, civil-military relations, and at NATO's Centers of
Excellence. Led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, ACO is
responsible for collective defense through direction, requirements,
planning, and execution at the strategic level. However, the Strategic
Concept 2022 should focus less on the emergence of new technologies and
more on how NATO's military and civilian personnel use them. **[ACO and
ACT must emphasize greater accessibility to information and data for its
multinational warfighters, cyber operators, and civilian professionals.
NATO must reach out to experts in the private sector, academia, and
non-governmental organizations to harness ways to expand access and
emphasize flexibility in multi-domain operations.]{.underline}** NATO
can do this by providing more grants to private sector partners and
establish a new center of excellence on data and information sharing.
**[ACO and ACT should also enable personnel and partners to readily
access data and information in DIMEL domains: diplomatic,
information/cyber, military, economic, and legal]{.underline}**. This
would expand the range of measures needed by ACT and ACO to connect and
correlate deterrence with evolving hybrid threats**[. To deter hybrid
threats across multiple domains, with enhanced access on different
digital platforms, NATO members should develop smarter and lethal
capabilities to confront threats from state and non-state actors. This
would allow ACT and ACO to prepare for any contingency and respond to
adversaries in battlefields and battlespaces.]{.underline}** Plug and
Play The 2022 Strategic Concept encourages collaboration in the
implementation of guidelines and procedures through a "plug-and-play"
concept, in which platforms and systems are optimized for readiness and
response at lightning speed. Plug-and-play is based on approaches used
in commercial software that allow for innovation and easy access to
networks and systems through secure platforms. The NATO School
Oberammergau should offer platform training and education courses
programs in mobile access for ACT and ACO personnel with appropriate
security clearances. This would allow them to access the appropriate
platform and utilize data and information necessary for their tasks and
responsibilities. For example, NATO's Small Arms and Light Weapons
(SALW) and Mine Action (MA) Information Sharing Platform contains rich
and publicly available datasets on the roles played by the alliance in
mitigating the illicit trade in small arms, tanks, aircraft, and naval
vessels. It reports and updates NATO-funded projects to prevent
adversaries from acquiring these weapons. However, the SALW-MA platform
is outdated and not user friendly, impeding its functionality in
practice. Put simply, NATO's ACT and ACO should focus as much on easing
access to information as it does on advanced technologies and
conventional weaponry. This would provide NATO with useful tools to
access data and intelligence on the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels and in land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains using devices and
platforms that can seamlessly connect in different locations. But NATO
Commands cannot simply expect its existing personnel to adapt. They must
be trained and educated on a regular basis to use digital
infrastructures in ways that make their jobs easier. **[On the strategic
level, the 2022 Strategic Concept must provide NATO's political and
military leaders with flexibility and resources to discern the diversity
of hybrid threats in the environment]{.underline}**. NATO's strategic
planners, cyber operators, and warfighters should be trained and
educated in relevant digital platforms, access, and sharing data and
information in ways that improve collaborative decision-making and
collective defense. On the operations level, personnel must be given
enough space to share data and intelligence as well as to train tactical
level personnel on software that enables them to collect, analyze,
process, and disseminate information quickly and easily across multiple
domains. **[Addressing these challenges is difficult for just one
nation-state, let alone for all 30 NATO members. Therefore, the 2022
Strategic Concept should emphasize connectivity between member states in
multi-domain operations]{.underline}** and in collaboration with the
private sector and academia. Accessibility to information and data
sharing among NATO members should be securitized and harmonized.
Essential Role of Artificial Intelligence The challenge for NATO is not
necessarily adopting and investing in emerging and disrupting
technologies for collective defense. Rather, the question is whether
**[ACT and ACO can enhance accessibility to digital platforms and ease
communications between platforms. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) can
play a role in overcoming critical obstacles. AI is now occupying a
greater space in NATO's collective defense orientation. The challenge in
the 2022 Strategic Concept will be delineating the degree to which AI
will enhance the ability of the alliance to analyze information and
assess data.]{.underline}** Moreover, AI is only as good as the data it
relies on. To maintain its technological edge, in 2021 **[NATO released
an Artificial Intelligence Strategy,]{.underline}** a good step toward
maximizing interoperability of weapons systems, improving
infrastructure, and building resilient hybrid defenses. While it
emphasizes collaboration with the private sector and academia, **[the
strategy needs further refinement as AI would help NATO's military and
civilian personnel interlink devices on different platforms, perform
rigorous data analytics, and quicken response time in response to a
conventional or hybrid attack. One innovation is the Defence Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA).]{.underline}** DIANA
leverages partnerships among academics, technology companies, start-up
firms to address the full spectrum of threats in the security
environment. Private sector firms utilizing DIANA can access innovation
sites and test centers that focus on artificial intelligence, machine
learning, quantum computing, autonomous machines, and biotechnology. In
the past, alliance members supported the creation and development of a
venture capital Innovation Fund for technology companies and start-ups.
**[The Strategic Concept should support the initiative with sustained
public funds in ways that allow for strategic-level planning at ACO and
ATO to communicate more effectively at the operational and tactical
levels. DIANA and the Innovation Fund are models for the
alliance.]{.underline}** An existing partnership that is proving

formidable and proactive actor against persistent Chinese and Russian
hacks, espionage, and infiltration of allied networks. Washington will
also push allies to do more to counter Chinese and Russian
disinformation, investment in sensitive critical infrastructure and
other hybrid activities in allied nations, which have serious security
implications. For some at NATO, resilience should also include stronger
sustainability guidelines and natural disaster response capacities to
mitigate shocks from climate change. **[[But given NATO's limited

Intensifying internal political--military dialogue It is clear that
**[[NATO's broad engagement with a range of amorphous
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** following the end of the Cold War
**[[eroded its own internal political--military
dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The art of managing such crises was new
to the Alliance, and **[[it relied more on diplomacy and a host of other
non-military means to do so]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[rather than
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** defence plans and military
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, as NATO -- with some
difficulty -- built experience in crisis management from Bosnia and
Kosovo to Afghanistan and Libya, the close communication that had once
existed between the North Atlantic Council and SACEUR withered, becoming
more contingent in nature. The Strategic **[[Concept should help to
rebuild this relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By **[[prioritising
collective defence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and building a narrative of
values, the Strategic **[[Concept would invite a dialogue on the
compatibility of a broad set of values with a focused military strategy
to keep Russia at ba]{.underline}]{.mark}**y in the Euro-Atlantic area.
The challenge will be to sustain this dialogue. The Reflection Group
appointed by Stoltenberg rightly emphasised the need to enhance NATO's
political consultations,but gave scant attention to political--military
dialogue.48 **[[NATO should consider putting military technology front
and centre in this dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Military technology
has come a long way, offering vastly enhanced processing power
**[[rooted in artificial intelligence (AI)]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
faster loops from decision to strike, and the high speeds of hypersonic
weaponry. Of course, **[[rapid change can cause problems that need
political framing and guidance.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[New
technology complicates not only inter-service or joint warfare but also
multinational warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** and, not least, the
civilian decision-making that is meant to lie at the heart of

**[To ensure NATO's relevance and to keep "our people safe", the
Alliance "must continue to strengthen and modernize our deterrence and
defence]{.underline}**," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at
the Riga Summit on 30 November 2021. **[Innovation plays a critical
role]{.underline}** **[in modernizing armed forces amid a complex
strategic environment. To this purpose,]{.underline}** **[Stoltenberg
unveiled]{.underline}** the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (**[DIANA]{.underline}**) on 22 October 2021. DIANA shall bring
defence and commercial companies together with military users to develop
novel solutions that meet the needs of the future battlefield. He also
launched the NATO Innovation Fund **[to invest up to €1bn to support
innovators developing emerging technologies]{.underline}**. The
announcement comes at a time when the Alliance is working on a new
Strategic Concept. Innovation will be key to preserving NATO's edge, as
the Secretary-General pointed out in his 2030 food for thought paper.
Although NATO is a potent defence organization, emphasis on emerging
technologies reveals its Achilles' heel. **[Artificial intelligence,
autonomy, biotechnology, quantum technology, and other technologies are
at the heart of geoeconomic competition. Geoeconomic competition unfolds
around the projection of economic power within and across the domains of
land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve political
goals]{.underline}**. **[Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning
business models amid a growing dichotomy between market-driven and
state-driven nations]{.underline}**. It aims to set the rules,
principles, and standards that guide economic activities and access to
and ownership of emerging technologies. NATO's current emphasis on
emerging technologies with defence and commercial applications risks
making the Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic dynamic. This
dynamic can undermine NATO's innovation agenda and endanger its
strategic edge. Therefore, NATO needs to respond. First, NATO needs to
embrace the realities of economic security seriously. This call flows
logically from Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, encouraging
allies' economic collaborations. In our view, economic security combines
national security and economic policy with technology and innovation
policy to identify economic disruptions. It also prevents these
disruptions from arising and strengthens a coping capacity to deal with
economic emergencies. **[Economic security requires allies, for example,
to engage on defence-critical standards, advancing transparency for
defence supply chains, and considering the interplay between technology
development, foreign direct investment, and export
control]{.underline}**. **[Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should
incorporate economic security as an essential element.]{.underline}**

As **[[NATO prepares to update its Strategic Concept, some might be
tempted to]{.underline}]{.mark}** regard this moment as an opportunity
to **[[push NATO beyond Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- that is,
**[[beyond political division and towards]{.mark} a new era of
[trans-atlantic solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such a push is
certainly needed, and dovetails with the heightened awareness that in a
new geopolitical age, and following the debacle in Afghanistan,
democratic values may lack the power to bring allies together and to
offer the kind of unified vision required for renewed geopolitical
competition. **[[The danger]{.underline}]{.mark}** highlighted in this
article **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[political enthusiasm for
renewal might well produce a myopic, inadequate Strategic
Concept]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO has been here before: **[[in
2009--10]{.underline}]{.mark}**, eager to move beyond the political
divisions built into the war on terror, **[[NATO embraced a Strategic
Concept that was perfectly crafted to speak to the Alliance's broad
range of political interests and sensibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
In an age of contingent crisis management, NATO could muddle through
without a clear statement of political--military priorities and defence
guidance. **[[In an era of great-power competition, this kind of
muddling through would be a calamity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO's
post-Crimea adaptation tells the story. NATO responded with political
vigour, condemning Russia and placing the burden of change on Moscow
while bolstering its own defence and deterrence posture. However,
internal political limitations meant that NATO did not develop its
thinking on the nature of the threat and the effects that would serve to
deter it. By 2016, when Trump burst onto the scene, NATO's capacity for
such in-depth political thinking seemed non-existent. The military
authorities seized the initiative, crafting a new military strategy
centred on desired effects and deterrence. This first real strategy
since the adoption in 1967 of NATO's Flexible Response strategy was then
met with political ambivalence. **[[NATO needs to get its strategic
house in order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The political--military divide
outlined in this article is real but not yet alarming; **[[a failure to
tend to it in the new Strategic Concept would sound the
alarm]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Confronting Russia while competing with
China, digesting the lessons of Afghanistan and **[[developing a range
of policy competences in cyber, resilience, outer space,
capacity-building and more is indeed a tall political
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Strategy is about
priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, and **[[NATO's priorities
must bridge the political-- military divide.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Thus, the new Strategic **[[Concept could do worse than establish
collective defence as an overriding priority]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
wrap it in a narrative of democratic values necessitating both a
rebalanced NATO and collective defence; **[[and invite continuous
political--military dialogue on military technology and its strategic
implications.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Link turn \-\-- bioweapons

#### Including bioweapons in the strategic concept improves deterrence.

**[Amid growing speculation that Russia could employ chemical weapons in
its war against Ukraine, NATO has collectively voiced its concern over
such an escalation]{.underline}**, saying it would "result in severe
consequences." The Alliance has also pledged to increase protective
equipment for Ukraine while enhancing its readiness against any
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. But how serious
are the chemical and biological threats, and what exactly should NATO do
to prepare? The West is right to be concerned. Russia used nerve agents
from the Novichok family of chemical weapons to target a former Russian
intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in the United
Kingdom in 2018 and prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny in
Siberia in 2020. These attacks---predictably denied by
Moscow---contradicted Russia's claims that it destroyed the remnants of
its chemical weapons program in 2017. Russia has also propped up a
Syrian regime that repeatedly used chemical weapons in its brutal civil
war, as well as wielded its United Nations Security Council (UNSC) veto
to shield Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other responsible
individuals in his government from justice. This impunity has set a
dangerous precedent that could tempt Russia: If Damascus could get away
with it, why can't Moscow? Meanwhile, Russia has also circulated
disinformation about a purported biological weapons program in Ukraine
backed by the United States---and even brought these false claims to the
UNSC in March (they were swiftly dismissed). Related conspiracy theories
have taken off on platforms such as Twitter and Telegram, received air
time on US television channels, and were parroted by China. These
allegations could set the pretext for a false-flag attack involving
chemical weapons that Russia could use to expand its invasion or justify
additional military action against Ukraine. While sanctions have
destabilized the Russian economy and shrunk the resources available for
President Vladimir Putin's war efforts, he likely already has what he
needs to mount chemical attacks in Ukraine. Moves, not just messaging
**[To preempt Russia's use of chemical or biological weapons, the United
States and its NATO allies must publicly demonstrate that the West takes
this threat seriously and are prepared to respond.]{.underline}** In the
past few weeks, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Department of
Defense spokesperson John Kirby have done just that, raising these
issues on social media and during press conferences. NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg made clear that any use of chemical or
biological weapons would violate international law, while citing worries
that the effects of biological or chemical agents would be felt in
Ukraine's neighboring countries (several of which are NATO members). And
just as it "pre-bunked" potential Russian false-flag operations before
the invasion began, the United States should also aggressively and
proactively debunk Russian misinformation about chemical and biological
weapons. Additionally, **[NATO should update its strategy for countering
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**
T**[he Comprehensive, Strategic-Level Policy for Preventing the
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Defending Against
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Threats was last
updated in 2009 and does not account for the numerous developments in
the international security environment]{.underline}**. For example,
**[the document references cooperation with Russia as a key element to
curbing WMD proliferation, which is clearly untenable
today]{.underline}**. Russia has also shown its willingness to flout
international norms and use CBRN weapons---so **[NATO's new
policy]{.underline}** **[must place a corresponding emphasis on the
ability to defend against such weapons. The Alliance is set to release
its next Strategic Concept]{.underline}** at the Madrid Summit in June;
**[by referencing a more relevant CBRN policy in that document, NATO
would send a clear message to Moscow that CBRN threats remain top of
mind.]{.underline}** Messaging, however, is not enough. Words must be
backed up by tangible actions. NATO has sent forty thousand troops to
allied nations close to Ukraine; they should be reinforced with CBRN
defense capabilities. NATO's top military commander, US Air Force
General Tod Wolters, has already activated the Alliance's Combined Joint
CBRN Defense Task Force, putting it on alert in case it is required to
deploy. It can respond to a chemical, biological, radiological, or
nuclear attack with reconnaissance, sampling, protection, and
decontamination capabilities, among others. Deploying this task force to
support other military reinforcements along its eastern flank would
demonstrate NATO's practical preparedness to respond to contingencies
that could involve CBRN weapons used by Russia. Finally, the US
Department of Defense should sustain its support of Ukraine via the
Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, which was established after
the fall of the Soviet Union to secure and destroy Soviet WMD materials.
The CTR program has a long history of working with Ukrainian officials
to reduce WMD threats by destroying nuclear delivery systems and
improving biological safety and security. US efforts can benefit from
CTR's long-standing relationships with Ukrainian government partners to
quickly deliver additional supplies and equipment, which could include
supporting other US government efforts to provide Ukraine with
protective gear in case of a chemical attack. **[Through coordinated
efforts that incorporate public messaging]{.underline}** and tangible
action, **[NATO might have a chance to dissuade Russia from escalating
the conflict in Ukraine to chemical warfare]{.underline}**. But to do
that, Moscow needs to know that the use of chemical weapons will not
help its ill-fated invasion and will not be tolerated.

NATO has defined two distinct responsibilities concerning cyber defence:
(a) collective defence and (b) the protection of NATO networks. In 2011,
**[the NATO Cyber Defence Policy established that "\[i\]n order to
perform the Alliance's core tasks of collective defence and crisis
management, the integrity and continuous functioning of its information
systems must be guaranteed]{.underline}**."6 **[The Wales Summit
Declaration]{.underline}** of 2014 **[expanded on this when the Alliance
affirmed that cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective
defence,]{.underline}** yet the Enhanced NATO Policy on Cyber Defence of
2014 failed to delineate roles and responsibilities.7 **[The task of
defending the alliance against armed attacks through cyberspace with
military means was thereby added on top of a policy for network defence.
As long as the NATO Cyber Defence Policy merely recognises that the
principle of collective defence is applicable in cyberspace, while
limiting possible action to the protection of networks, it will continue
to cause confusion among Allies]{.underline}**. The principle of
collective defence is NATO's raison d'être and lies at the heart of
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. It commits the Alliance to protect
and defend the Allies' territory and populations against an armed
attack.8 Consequently, **[the accepted core responsibility of the
Alliance in cyberspace is to defend the Allies against armed attacks
through cyberspace, when necessary through military
means]{.underline}**. However, **[the only means at its disposal is the
protection of its own networks and systems]{.underline}**. This means
that **[while the Alliance recognises that cyberspace can be used by
adversaries to launch an armed attack against it, it is impossible for
the Alliance to counter such an attack in and through
cyberspace]{.underline}**. For NATO, this is rather a novel approach to
its responsibilities. It would, for instance, be unimaginable that in
response to an armed air attack, NATO would not allow for the use of air
power, but would limit its response to the use of air defence systems.
**[While the core tasks of collective defence and the protection of own
networks are clearly connected and overlapping responsibilities, they
are executed under different political, legal, and organisational
frameworks]{.underline}**. The responsibility for the protection of its
own networks is, in principle, the same for NATO as it is for any other
large public or corporate organisation working with sensitive
information. It is essential to the security and continuity of these
organisations, but it is a task mostly carried out in a peacetime
context and day-to-day business setting. Outside of an armed conflict,
cyber attacks against NATO as an organisation will be qualified as cyber
espionage, cyber crime or, in some cases, information operations; but
not as armed attacks. Thus, **[the organisation has the obligation to
protect its networks, systems and data but there is a big difference
between guarding duties and combat actions]{.underline}**. Likewise, as
the Alliance will not use military means to counter these types of cyber
attacks, the guiding policy should not be defined in military
terminology or integrated into a larger military framework. However,
**[that does not mean that a guiding policy for the use of cyber
operations is unnecessary and it certainly does not mean that a network
defence policy can substitute a cyber operations policy.]{.underline}**

**[Given modern armed forces' dependency on digital technology, it is
legitimate to expect that NATO would adapt to this new reality. Since
2002, NATO has invested significantly in improving the defence of its
networks]{.underline}**. However, NATO has shown little inclination to
move away from its current purely defensive posture in cyber defence. At
the political level, Allies remain reticent when it comes to discussing
the options of using military (offensive) capabilities within a NATO
setting. For most of them, cyber operations are generally still
uncharted territory in which confusion abounds. Moreover, Allies that
have invested heavily in cyber capabilities worry that others might
benefit without making a similar investment themselves. Allies therefore

**[Five steps could transform NATO into an innovator in its strategic
environment]{.underline}**: establishing a civil-military technology
assessment capability; **[prioritizing]{.underline}** systemic
**[innovation]{.underline}** targets; **[setting ambitious benchmarks
linking innovation to capability development, deterrence, defense, and
resilience; doubling down on collaborative innovation so that no ally
gets left behind in the innovation competition]{.underline}**; and
committing to more ambitious NATO-EU cooperation. Throughout NATO's
history, **[defense innovation has been critical to its technological
edge and its deterrence and defense posture against multiple threats.
The unprecedented progress in emerging and disruptive technologies
(EDTs) offers the prospect and challenge of transformative defense
innovation for allied armed forces and societies at large. Technological
progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, advanced
robotics, biotechnologies and human enhancement, quantum technologies,
big-data analytics, and fifth-generation telecommunication systems, as
well as growing autonomy in the critical functions of military systems,
promise to change how wars are fought, how fast, where, and by whom.
These technologies enable new forms of military presence, coercive
action, and power projection in and across old and new
domains]{.underline}** (for example, **[cyberspace]{.underline}** and
outer space) **[and below and above the conventional threshold of armed
conflict.]{.underline}** However, **[NATO and the transatlantic allies
are neither the only nor the most agile actors investing in emerging and
disruptive technologies. China and Russia already invest substantially
in and have accelerated their adoption of these technologies in military
applications]{.underline}**. **[To maintain its strategic advantage
against China and Russia, NATO needs to become an agent of innovation
and be more agile and strategic in supporting allies to jointly exploit
new technologies for deterrence, defense, and resilience purposes. NATO
has prioritized EDTs and signaled it has joined "the technological
adoption race" against China and Russia.]{.underline}**1 Much work
remains to be done. Allies remain divided on the ethical and legal
specifics of the military use of EDTs and by their national-industrial
preferences. Technological capacity across the alliance also varies
significantly and, as always, funding is in short supply. Concrete
decisions on how to consolidate innovation in EDTs, a critical task for
NATO's mission and future adaptation, are expected at this month's
Brussels summit. Specifically, allies will respond to calls for a
"strategic surge" in EDTs2 innovation by establishing a Defense
Innovation Accelerator, an opt-in instrument funded through dedicated
national contributions, which NATO hopes will incentivize innovation and
transatlantic cooperation on emerging technologies.3 As NATO prepares to
embark on the adoption of emerging and disruptive technologies, this
brief takes stock of its ongoing efforts in this field. It examines what
drives the alliance's efforts to exploit EDTs for defense innovation and
what it would take for NATO to become an innovator in an environment of
unprecedented technological progress and great-power competition. NATO's
ongoing efforts in innovation and EDTs are a step in the right
direction. However, to survive in a world of multipolar great-power
competition and deliver security to its members, it needs to innovate,
not just to adapt incrementally. **[NATO needs a new framework in which
innovation drives adaptation]{.underline}**, rather than the other way
round as is currently the case. **[Investing now in the establishment of
a resilient innovation capability for the whole of the alliance is a
long-term investment in the future of NATO and a strategic
necessity]{.underline}**. In addition to ongoing efforts, NATO allies
should consider five further steps: establishing a NATO civil-military
technology assessment capability; prioritizing systemic innovation
targets; setting ambitious benchmarks linking innovation to capability
development, deterrence, defense, and resilience; doubling down on
collaborative innovation so that no ally gets left behind in the
innovation competition; and committing to more ambitious NATO-EU
cooperation. NATO, Innovation, and Emerging Technologies **[In
NATO]{.underline}** and the armed forces of 30 allies,
**[technology-driven defense innovation]{.underline}**4 **[is an ongoing
process that encompasses transformational or disruptive
innovation---"revolutions in military affairs"---and evolutionary,
incremental, or sustained innovation]{.underline}**. The **[alliance has
solid experience and practice in defense innovation and technology
assessment]{.underline}**, not least because defense innovation is seen
as a crucial part of continuous adaptation to its strategic
environment.5 However, the commercialization of digital emerging
technologies critical to allied security and defense, the ongoing
technological competition with great powers such as China and Russia,
and its own inertial bureaucratic procedures challenge NATO's capacity
to innovate.

**[This issue, over which there are no major disagreements among V4
states, comprises cybersecurity and the development of the alliance's
resilience in cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[All member states agree that
this new operational domain has become vital in all types of conflicts,
and therefore must be a key area of cooperation amongst NATO
members]{.underline}**. Our experts also noted that **[cyber resilience
is an area where cohesion can be achieved at the lowest
cost]{.underline}**. This does not diminish the importance of the topic
at hand; rather, it shows us that there are still key challenges which
have to be overcome in the near future. Despite the fact that it is not
a physical area of operations, **[cyberspace cannot be separated from
the aforementioned geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. It is also
connected with the question of the alliance's stance towards Russia and
China; both of these countries have robust capabilities in cyberspace,
which they are keen to utilise in the developing great power
competition. This factor is also relevant on a lower level, connected to
other disruptive and hostile powers such as Iran or North Korea, as well
as non-state actors such as international terrorist organisations. The
V4 countries naturally have lower levels of readiness in cyberspace than
the great powers do; however, **[it is entirely possible for small and
medium-sized powers to enhance their resilience against
cyberattacks.]{.underline}** For example, **[Estonia reacted (with the
support of NATO) to Russian cyber aggression, and developed robust
defensive infrastructure and practices, which should be emulated by
other countries.]{.underline}** Due to its limited size, resources,
demography, and industrial capacity, Estonia could not aspire to such a
power position in terms of conventional warfare. **[International
cooperation in cyber resilience is also a force multiplier, and no
country can or should rely solely on itself.]{.underline}** Thus, **[it
is in the interests of security and political stability to have more
pronounced cooperation in this field.]{.underline}** The V4 can be a
champion in this area: **[Poland is a great example of the rapid
development of the cyber industry, deeply anchored in the transatlantic
alliance. The security environment in the 21st century is fundamentally
different to any time in the past. The geopolitics of today is not about
the possession of territory and material resources, but
about]{.underline}** the interdependence of economies and companies, as
well as the **[incorporation of new technologies, such as 5G networks
and AI]{.underline}**, often developed either in the US or China. In
such an environment, **[NATO should incorporate defence capabilities
into the fields of cyberspace]{.underline}**, countering fake news,
human trafficking, and weaponising migration.

**[Industrial cooperation and technological innovation is a subject that
has been gaining ground in NATO circles]{.underline}** in recent years,
**[particularly with regard to emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline}**. It is true that the economic interests of
the companies based in the member countries differ, and that **[so far
NATO has not managed to consolidate the channels of existing
collaboration.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the EU's aspiration to attain
strategic autonomy, and the particular attention it pays to the
technological-industrial aspect of defence, heralded another episode of
transatlantic discord, now on the way to being healed thanks to the
concept of so-called 'open' strategic autonomy, which will enable
non-EU-member allies to take part in its industrial and technological
initiatives. Added to the discrepancies between allies **[there is now
the need to address the challenge posed by emerging technologies and
those threatening to disrupt the traditional military superiority of the
Alliance]{.underline}**. In this context, **[the NATO 2030 report
emphasises the importance of the Alliance maintaining its technological
lead over possible rivals and warns of the progress made by China in

Technology advances. The participants agreed that **[technology advances
are important for NATO's continued cohesion. Technology will constitute
a significant intervening factor in how NATO nations maintain their
cohesion in the future for three reasons]{.underline}**. First,
**[ever-evolving]{.underline}** communication **[technology can
facilitate the spread of risks coming from outside of the Alliance and
exacerbate their negative effect.]{.underline}** The examples that
resonated the most during focus group sessions are information warfare
and targeted propaganda against NATO nations. Internet communications
technology creates infinite room for alternative media that distort
reality, contribute to the emergence of populist and radical movements,
and increase the danger of miscommunication among nations. Second,
**[NATO risks losing the innovation game to the commercial defense
industrial sector]{.underline}**. In the future, private companies will
continue to stay ahead of NATO in designing specifications and setting
standards for platforms. **[This can have a major impact on readiness
and interoperability among NATO nations if their innovation
efforts]{.underline}** (e.g., the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) **[do not
materialize]{.underline}**.31 Third, **[some nations may become
reluctant to share their latest technology acquisitions]{.underline}**,
especially if they put private gains above the collective endeavor. This
would pose a challenge "for anyone to share information they own without
gaining any profit for themselves." The **[political unwillingness may
feed distrust, which can result in a deepening interoperability gap
between allies on the battlefield, and ultimately, a less cohesive
Alliance.]{.underline}**

#### No tradeoff -- incorporating emerging tech cooperation into the strategic concept makes NATO deterrence more effective and modern

**Thomson and Stacey 6/19**/22 \[Sir Adam Thomson, former United Kingdom
ambassador to NATO, is now director of the European Leadership Network,

Graham Stacey, former chief of staff of NATO Transformation, is senior

But while strong defense is necessary for deterrence, it does not
guarantee it. **[For effective collective defense in unstable times, the
2022 Strategic Concept must deliver modern deterrence fit for the next
decade.]{.underline}** That means changes from the 2010 Concept, which
was written for a less demanding era. The new wording should adapt
existing text but give sharper focus and clearer intent. **[The 2022
Concept should move the Alliance beyond 2010's purely military
conception of deterrence to modern, full-spectrum
deterrence]{.underline}** in peace, crisis and war**[, using all the
tools available to NATO and developing intellectual capital on
deterrence across all levels of the Alliance.]{.underline}** Agreed NATO
language since 2010 already recognises the need for modern deterrence to
be full spectrum. But the 2022 Concept should further guide Allies on
how. Four quite simple adjustments would make NATO's deterrence more
effective at lower risk and lower cost. First, resilience. The first
segment of the deterrence spectrum is to deny your enemy the ability to
damage or coerce you. **[Allies are already sharply focused on things
like diversifying energy supplies and defending against
cyberattack]{.underline}**. Last year, they agreed, painfully, on
reviewing each other's resilience, because to an important degree **[the
Alliance is only as strong as its weakest link]{.underline}**. But
**[national resilience wasn't explicitly part of 2010 deterrence. It
needs to be made integral in 2022]{.underline}**. Second, communication.
Deterrence is all about what goes on in the mind of the adversary.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows just how spectacularly Moscow can
miscalculate not only its next-door neighbour Ukraine but also the West
as a whole. The Alliance needs not just the capability and credible will
to defend itself but also the ability to communicate those facts
accurately to its adversaries. Far more than in 2010, the new Concept
must say how NATO will enhance its channels of diplomatic and military
communication and use the full potential of its existing ones to plant
deterrence, risk reduction and de-escalation with maximum effectiveness
into Kremlin and other hostile minds. Third, shaping deterrence through
diplomacy. NATO seeks international stability with undiminished security
for all. It has always sought negotiated agreements to deliver this.
Arms control is in NATO's DNA, as is the diplomacy with which to deliver
it, because arms control can facilitate better deterrence at lower risk
and lower cost. The 2010 Concept doesn't describe arms control and the
diplomacy to deliver it as a part of deterrence. The new Concept should
make arms control central to NATO's modern deterrence toolkit, shaping
the confrontation with Russia and putting Moscow on the diplomatic
defensive. Fourth, **[updating for the coming decade.]{.underline}**
**[Emerging disruptive technologies]{.underline}** are already accepted
in the 2010 Concept as a part of deterrence. But less is said about
their **[impact]{.underline}** on **[strategic decision
making]{.underline}** (including nuclear): So many **[new technologies
from hypersonic missiles through space weapons to artificial
intelligence can distort or disrupt decisions. The complexity of the
interaction of disruptive technologies is an issue in itself. Effective
decision making is key to deterrence credibility]{.underline}**. So,
**[the 2022 Concept should include not just keeping the Alliance on the
technological front edge, understanding the threats and exploiting the
opportunities, but also confronting the challenges of technological
complexity for NATO decision making.]{.underline}** Thus ensuring that
mitigation is a central part of Alliance capability and institutional
development for the years to come. If the 2022 Concept sets the course,
the detailed planning will follow --- and **[NATO will be safer because
its deterrence will be stronger.]{.underline}**

LONDON --- **[The Taliban\'s stunningly swift advances across
Afghanistan have sparked global alarm, reviving doubts about the
credibility of U.S. foreign policy promises and drawing harsh criticisms
even from some of the United States\' closest allies.]{.underline}** As
Taliban fighters entered Kabul and the United States scrambled to
evacuate its citizens, concerns grew that the unfolding chaos could
create a haven for terrorists, unleash a major humanitarian disaster and
trigger a new refugee exodus. **[U.S. allies complain that they were not
fully consulted on a policy decision that potentially puts their own
national security interests at risk --- in contravention of President
Biden\'s promises to recommit to global engagement.]{.underline}** And
**[many around the world are wondering whether they could rely on the
United States to fulfill long-standing security commitments stretching
from Europe to East Asia.]{.underline}** \"Whatever happened to
\'America is back\'?\" said Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Defense
Committee in the British Parliament, citing Biden\'s foreign policy
promise to rebuild alliances and restore U.S. prestige damaged during
the Trump administration. \"People are bewildered that after two decades
of this big, high-tech power intervening, they are withdrawing and
effectively handing the country back to the people we went in to
defeat,\" Ellwood said. \"This is the irony. How can you say America is
back when we\'re being defeated by an insurgency armed with no more than
\[rocket-propelled grenades\], land mines and AK-47s?\" **[As much as
its military capabilities, the United States\' decades-old role as a
defender of democracies and freedoms is again in
jeopardy]{.underline}**, said Rory Stewart, who was Britain\'s minister
for international development in the Conservative government of Theresa
May. \"The Western democracy that seemed to be the inspiration for the
world, the beacon for the world, is turning its back,\" Stewart said.
**[Britain has voiced some of the bluntest criticisms of the
pullout]{.underline}**, which is unusual for a country that regards
itself as the United States\' closest ally. Britain made the biggest
contribution to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and suffered the highest
number of casualties after the United States. In comments Friday,
**[British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace predicted civil war and the
return of al-Qaeda]{.underline}**, the terrorist organization whose
attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, prompted the U.S.-led intervention in
Afghanistan. **[\"I feel this was not the right time or decision to
make,\" he told]{.underline}** Sky News. \"**[Of course al-Qaeda will
probably come back, and certainly it would like that kind of breeding
ground.\"]{.underline}** \"**[Strategically, it causes a lot of
problems, and as an international community, it\'s very difficult . . .
what we\'re seeing today]{.underline}**,\" he added. Rivals of the
United States also have expressed dismay. Among them is China, which
fears that the ascent of an extremist Islamist government on its western
border will foster unrest in the adjoining province of Xinjiang, where
Beijing has waged sweeping crackdowns on the Uyghur population that have
been denounced by the West. Washington \"bears an unavoidable
responsibility for the current situation in Afghanistan,\" Col. Wu Qian,
a spokesman for China\'s Ministry of National Defense, said earlier this
month. \"It cannot leave and shed the burden on regional countries.\"
Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected criticisms that the
withdrawal damages U.S. credibility. He said staying mired in a conflict
that is not in the \"national interest\" would do far more damage.
\"Most of our strategic competitors around the world would like nothing
better than for us to remain in Afghanistan for another year, five
years, 10 years, and have those resources dedicated to being in the
midst of a civil war,\" Blinken told CNN. \"It\'s simply not in our
interest.\" But **[the manner and implementation of the withdrawal has
left allies feeling betrayed]{.underline}**, said Cathryn Clüver
Ashbrook, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. Germany's
government, which withdrew its troops in June and is evacuating its
embassy, has refrained from overt criticism of the U.S. withdrawal.
Nonetheless, some **[German officials and lawmakers are seething at
Washington\'s failure to consult coalition partners]{.underline}** such
as Berlin, Clüver Ashbrook said. **[Germany is particularly concerned
about the potential for an exodus of Afghan refugees]{.underline}**
similar to the influx of 2015, when more than 1 million migrants,
spurred largely by the war in Syria, surged into Europe, with many
headed for Germany. \"The Biden administration came to office promising
an open exchange, a transparent exchange with its allies. They said the
transatlantic relationship would be pivotal,\" she said. \"As it is,
**[they\'re playing lip service to the transatlantic relationship and
still believe European allies should fall into line with U.S.
priorities.\"]{.underline}** \"**[We\'re back to the transatlantic
relationship of old, where the Americans dictate everything. . . . \'Yes
we want to partner with you, but in reality, we want to be able to tell
you what to do and when]{.underline}**,\' \" she added. The United
States\' Arab allies, which have long counted on the U.S. military to
come to their aid in the event of an attack by Iran, also have faced
questions over whether they will be able to rely on the United States.
\"**[What\'s happening in Afghanistan is raising alarm bells
everywhere]{.underline}**,\" said Riad Kahwaji, who heads the Inegma
security consultancy in the United Arab Emirates, which hosts one of the
biggest American military contingents in the Middle East. \"**[The
U.S.\'s credibility as an ally has been in question for a
while]{.underline}**,\" he said. \"We see Russia fighting all the way to
protect the Assad regime \[in Syria\], and now **[the Americans are
pulling out and leaving a big chaos in Afghanistan.\"]{.underline}**
Clüver Ashbrook said Biden\'s plan to build an alliance of democracies
to counter the influence of China and Russia is also in doubt, now that
the West will no longer maintain a significant presence in Central Asia.
For China and Russia, there is opportunity as well as concern in the
departure of U.S. troops. Both Moscow and Beijing have hosted Taliban
delegations in recent weeks in an attempt to pave the way for a
post-American future in the region. The humiliating conclusion of the
two-decade U.S. venture into Afghanistan will aid their efforts to
persuade many governments to seek out relationships elsewhere, analysts
say. In a commentary directed at Hong Kong, China\'s state-run Global
Times cited Afghanistan in a signal to democracy activists not to heed
repeated American promises to \"stand by\" Hong Kong. \"**[It has been
proven repeatedly that whomever U.S. politicians claim to stand with
will face bad luck, plunge into social unrest and suffer severe
consequences]{.underline}**,\" the commentary said.

As a starting point, **[it is important]{.underline}** **[to
recognize]{.underline}** that **[almost]{.underline}**
**[all]{.underline}** **[NATO nations]{.underline}**, **[other than the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
**[have]{.underline}**---in the words of a recent European Union (EU)
analysis---**[had "years of defence underspending]{.underline}**,
**[which has led to an accumulation]{.underline}** **[of gaps and
shortfalls]{.underline}** in the collective military"
capabilities.[1](javascript:void(0))

Most importantly in the context of the current environment,
**[the]{.underline}** "**[capacity to operate
full-spectrum]{.underline}** **[and at high intensity]{.underline}**
**[was neglected]{.underline}**."[2](javascript:void(0)) That neglect,
and the concomitant need to focus on reestablishing the capacity for
high-intensity battle, is well recognized by NATO military leaders. For
example, France's "Strategic Vision of the Chief of Defense Staff"
specifically sets forth the requirement to be able to "respond...in a
high-intensity conflict."[3](javascript:void(0)) Yet, as a recent RAND
report stated: **[France's capacity to sustain]{.underline}** **[a
high-end]{.underline}**, **[conventional]{.underline}**
**[conflict]{.underline}** nonetheless **[is limited]{.underline}**. The
French military might be able to accomplish all its assigned missions at
once, but it **[lacks depth, meaning]{.underline}** **[that such
demanding]{.underline}** **[operations]{.underline}** **[would quickly
exhaust]{.underline}** both its human and material resources." **[What
is true for France is similarly true for other]{.underline}**
**[European militaries]{.underline}**,
**[including]{.underline}**---perhaps most
importantly---**[Germany]{.underline}**, **[which has suffered from
years of underspending and strategic neglect]{.underline}**. In
addition, while operating at a different scale in terms of resources and
reach, the US military itself is insufficiently prepared, in particular,
in terms of its munitions and supply inventories for a sustained,
high-intensity conflict. However, these deficiencies are entirely
remediable if appropriate measures are taken.

**[conventional]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**, if necessary,

attack]{.underline}**---**[is the cornerstone of the
alliance]{.underline}**. "All for one and one for all" sounds fine, but
nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch, or
Canadian displeasure. Yet **[the result of this is a colossal
dependence]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** **[U.S.
capabilities]{.underline}**, **[ranging]{.underline}** **[from
ammunition]{.underline}** **[and spare]{.underline}** parts (of which
European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny)
**[to]{.underline}** **[military transports]{.underline}** **[that move
forces]{.underline}** **[quickly]{.underline}** **[and

territory **[from]{.underline}** a country like

Conversely, **[the countries that most need
defending]{.underline}**---Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---**[are the
least able to bear the burden]{.underline}**
**[themselves]{.underline}**. **[They need advanced
weapons]{.underline}**, particularly for air and missile defense,

land along the Polish-Lithuanian border, the so-called Suwalki Gap, is
particularly vulnerable to attack from Russia's militarized Kaliningrad
exclave and Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland and
Lithuania both want a big U.S. military presence---either a permanent
base or a persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this strategic
chokepoint.

headquarters]{.underline}**, **[one]{.underline}** divisional
headquarters **[split between Latvia and Denmark]{.underline}**,
**[another]{.underline}** divisional headquarters **[in
Poland]{.underline}**, **[and a corps headquarters at]{.underline}**
**[a different location in Poland.]{.underline}** Overall responsibility
for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint Forces Command
headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands; and Norfolk,
Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe, Air Force Gen.
Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in
Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea region has yet to
be decided---which is just as well, because **[NATO has yet to create a
naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the]{.underline}**
**[alliance drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and
defense of its northeastern members]{.underline}**, **[let alone decided
who would actually provide the forces and equipment in order to make
them credible.]{.underline}** Military mobility is meant to be the
responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command, headquartered in
Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the European Union's own
defense policy.

A further problem is exercises: **[NATO]{.underline}** **[does not
conduct fully]{.underline}** **[realistic]{.underline}**, **[large-scale
rehearsals]{.underline}** of how it would respond to a Russian attack.
One problem is that **[these are costly]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[disruptive]{.underline}**. Another is that they
expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO members, which can cope with a
carefully scripted exercise but lack the ability to improvise. A third
reason is the fear, in some countries, that practicing war-fighting
would be provocative. Also **[lacking are detailed plans]{.underline}**
**[for fighting a war against Russia]{.underline}**, covering such
issues as reinforcing of front-line states, **[countering a Russian
attack]{.underline}**, **[regaining any temporarily occupied
territory]{.underline}**, and---most of all---dealing with a nuclear or
other escalation. As a result, **[nobody is quite sure how anything
would work in a crisis]{.underline}**. Instead, another assumption
reigns: that in a crisis, the United States would take over and do the
heavy lifting on all fronts---logistics, intelligence, and combat.

Worse, **[NATO]{.underline}** **[is unprepared for]{.underline}** **[the
changing nature of modern]{.underline}** **[warfare]{.underline}**.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[old-style assault]{.underline}** on
Ukraine **[is all too familiar]{.underline}**. **[But the artillery
bombardments]{.underline}** **[and missile strikes]{.underline}**
**[that are grinding down]{.underline}** **[Ukraine's defenses are only
part of the Kremlin's arsenal.]{.underline}** Its most effective weapons
are nonmilitary: subversion, diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics,
economic coercion, corruption, and propaganda. **[The most
burning]{.underline}** current **[example]{.underline}** **[of
nonmilitary warfare]{.underline}** **[is Russia's
weaponizing]{.underline}** **[of hunger]{.underline}**. **[By blocking
Ukraine's grain exports]{.underline}**, **[Russia has]{.underline}**
**[raised the specter of famine over millions of people]{.underline}**,
including in volatile and fragile countries in North Africa and the
Middle East. Mass starvation is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but
its consequences include political unrest and mass migration, a direct
threat to Europe. Yet **[NATO is ill-equipped]{.underline}** **[to deal
with this]{.underline}**. **[It cannot mandate more economical use
of]{.underline}** **[grain]{.underline}**---for example, by feeding less
to livestock and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. **[It has no food
stockpiles to release to a hungry world]{.underline}**. **[It cannot
build]{.underline}** **[new railways to ship]{.underline}** Ukrainian
grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant vessels that
might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea blockade.
**[NATO has little in-house expertise]{.underline}** **[in countering
Russian disinformation and almost zero influence]{.underline}** **[in
African and other countries]{.underline}** **[susceptible to Kremlin
narratives]{.underline}** **[blaming the West for the food shortages
that are already starting now.]{.underline}**

#### America [dropped the ball]{.underline} by making it clear that they [wouldn't]{.underline} escalate in Ukraine\-\--NATO [can't recover]{.underline} without risking [war]{.underline}.

Dr. Nadia C. **Schadlow 22**, National Security Visiting Fellow at the
Hoover Institution and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, "Why
Deterrence Failed Against Russia," Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-u-s-deterrence-failed-ukraine-putin-military-defense-11647794454/micahw

**[A credible deterrent is designed to alter a potential aggressor\'s
calculations of risk and reward]{.underline}**. Vladimir **[Putin
determined that the]{.underline}** potential **[cost of invading Ukraine
was]{.underline}** **[relatively low]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** on Feb. 24 **[he attacked]{.underline}**. It will
be the job of historians to try to understand why **[deterrence
failed]{.underline}**.

**[Deterrence involves]{.underline}** two factors:
**[capability]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[will]{.underline}**. Capability means having the military strength to
deliver intolerable damage to an adversary. Will is the determination to
use that strength and deliver that damage.

**[The U.S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year to strengthen
its military capabilities]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** they
**[are formidable]{.underline}**. **[Resolve costs
nothing]{.underline}**, but it is priceless when it comes to deterring
aggression. **[By]{.underline}** **[signaling]{.underline}** **[that the
U.S. had]{.underline}** **[no intention]{.underline}** **[of using its
capabilities]{.underline}**, the **[Biden]{.underline}**
**[administration seriously weakened]{.underline}** **[their deterrent
value]{.underline}**.

The **[White House has]{.underline}** **[consistently]{.underline}**
**[broadcast what it won\'t do]{.underline}**, **[removing
a]{.underline}** **[crucial component]{.underline}** **[of
deterrence]{.underline}**: **[the ability to]{.underline}**
**[amplify]{.underline}** **[risk through ambiguity]{.underline}**. Mr.
Putin now knows exactly how much to escalate the conflict because U.S.
officials have told him exactly what the maximum U.S. response will be.

In early December, President **[Biden ruled out the possibility of using
U.S. military power]{.underline}**, **[stating that]{.underline}**
**[any consideration]{.underline}** **[of American combat troops in
Ukraine was]{.underline}** \"**[off the table]{.underline}**.\" In
January, even after trying to explain his comment that a \"minor
incursion\" wouldn\'t warrant a forceful response, Mr. **[Biden repeated
what he]{.underline}** **[wouldn\'t do]{.underline}**. **[There
wouldn\'t be]{.underline}** \"**[any American forces]{.underline}**
**[moving into Ukraine]{.underline}**,\" he said. In February he did it
again, explaining that U.S. actions were \"totally defensive\" and that
we \"had no intention of fighting Russia.\"

What is particularly puzzling is that **[these messages
were]{.underline}** **[broadcast]{.underline}** **[against a backdrop
of]{.underline}** **[increasing intelligence]{.underline}** **[that
Russia was preparing for war]{.underline}**. While **[the White
House]{.underline}** apparently had a strategy to \"aggressively
release\" intelligence, it concurrently made clear that it **[wouldn\'t
act on this intelligence to deter]{.underline}** Mr.
**[Putin]{.underline}**.

Most recently, Secretary of State **[Antony Blinken discounted the
possibility of deploying]{.underline}** **[N]{.underline}**orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization **[warplanes to support the Ukrainian
resistance]{.underline}**. He explained publicly that he was worried
**[such an arrangement might drag the U.S. and NATO into open conflict
with Russia]{.underline}**. This view was **[repeated]{.underline}**
**[by top military leaders]{.underline}**. The commanding general of the
U.S. European Command announced that the American intelligence community
had assessed that the \"transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken
as escalatory.\" In case this wasn\'t clear, the command further
clarified that it had no plans to \"facilitate an indirect, or third
party transfer of Polish aircraft.\"

Such statements consistently play down the will of the U.S. The Biden
administration\'s repeated statements that it is unwilling to escalate
under any circumstances increases the risks of unintended escalation.
Mr. Putin and his military are calculating American will based on what
they see and hear. This is likely why they are acting as though there is
little threat of resistance from any power more potent than the
Ukrainian military.

This doesn\'t necessarily mean that the U.S. should deploy its troops to
Ukraine or establish a no-fly zone by contesting Russian aircraft. The
current bipartisan consensus is that such actions aren\'t in the
American interest. But there is no reason to broadcast our reservations
and reveal the weakness of our will.

Why share internal policy discussions and military deliberations with an
adversary? A plausible explanation is that **[the White House has
decided to give priority to the U.S. domestic audience]{.underline}**,
as opposed to signaling to Russia. But **[by]{.underline}** **[openly
taking options off the table]{.underline}**, not only does **[the
administration]{.underline}** **[undercut]{.underline}** **[its
operational flexibility]{.underline}**, **[it gives the
enemy]{.underline}** **[additional clarity]{.underline}**. There is
value in ambiguity---especially when Russia is a master at it.

**[The Russians]{.underline}**, with their vivid history of resisting
better-equipped armies from imperial Sweden, France and Germany,
**[understand the importance of will]{.underline}**. **[It is a key
component of their military doctrine and is expressed in their concept
of]{.underline}** \"**[escalate to de-escalate]{.underline}**.\" That
means that **[the Russian military has stated its willingness to
increase the intensity of violence to end a war on favorable
terms]{.underline}**. Few observers doubt either Mr. Putin\'s ability or
willingness to do so.

### No Impact \-\-- Russia 

#### Russia won't escalate\-\--there's no [military]{.underline}, [allies]{.underline}, or [political incentives]{.underline} for them.

Dr. Limor **Simhony 22**, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for
National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, "NATO Intervention in Ukraine
Won't Spark World War III," Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/01/nato-intervention-in-ukraine-wont-spark-world-war-iii/micahw

**[The]{.underline}** **[main concern]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}** any such **[escalation could lead to]{.underline}**
**[W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar **[III]{.underline}**.
There are two reasons that **[this is]{.underline}**
**[unlikely]{.underline}**. The first is that **[Russia's military
capabilities are]{.underline}** **[poor]{.underline}** **[relative to
those of Western armies]{.underline}**. Their **[forces
are]{.underline}** **[not sufficiently trained]{.underline}**; **[their
equipment and weapons are]{.underline}** **[dated]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[inferior]{.underline}**; **[they
experience]{.underline}** **[major logistical]{.underline}**,
**[operational]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[tactical
difficulties]{.underline}**; **[and]{.underline}** their **[soldiers
have]{.underline}** **[low morale]{.underline}**.

Damaging **[economic sanctions]{.underline}** also **[mean that Russia
may not be able to]{.underline}** **[fund]{.underline}** **[a wider
war]{.underline}**. The **[expectation that Moscow will]{.underline}**
be able to **[escalate the war into other theaters in an effective
way]{.underline}**, especially by conventional means,
**[is]{.underline}** **[unrealistic]{.underline}**. It is possible that
if the Russian military continues to struggle, Russian President
Vladimir Putin will deploy chemical or even nuclear weapons to increase
gains and deter the West from interfering---but that is unlikely.

The **[second]{.underline}** is that **[Russia has become]{.underline}**
**[isolated]{.underline}**. To fight a world war, **[Russia needs
powerful allies]{.underline}**, **[which it does not
have]{.underline}**. Its strongest ally, **[China]{.underline}**, **[has
largely remained on the sidelines]{.underline}** since the war started.
**[It]{.underline}** **[abstained]{.underline}** **[from voting against
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**.**[N]{.underline}**.
**[resolution demanding that Russia ends its offensive]{.underline}**,
**[and it is worried]{.underline}** **[about secondary sanctions if it
aids Russia]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** **[only
countries]{.underline}** besides Russia **[that voted to reject the
resolution were]{.underline}** **[Belarus]{.underline}**, **[North
Korea]{.underline}**, **[Eritrea]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[Syria]{.underline}**---**[hardly a winning alliance]{.underline}**.
**[Both world wars saw]{.underline}** **[blocks]{.underline}** **[of
powerful allies fight one another]{.underline}**. Currently, **[such a
bloc]{.underline}** **[does not exist]{.underline}** **[on Russia's
side]{.underline}**.

These **[factors mean that there is]{.underline}** **[not a high
risk]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** substantial **[escalation into
total global war]{.underline}**. **[This should]{.underline}** be enough
to **[convince]{.underline}** **[Western nations to]{.underline}**
**[change]{.underline}** **[their engagement policy and help
Ukraine]{.underline}** win the war **[by repulsing an opponent that
is]{.underline}** **[considerably inferior]{.underline}** militarily
**[to their own forces]{.underline}**. It is unlikely to happen for two
main reasons: fear of Russian nukes and the West's aversion to
casualties.

The most widely discussed reason is **[the concern that Russia will use
nuclear weapons if NATO intervenes militarily]{.underline}**.
**[Putin]{.underline}** has **[reasserted]{.underline}** **[Russia's
right to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine]{.underline}**, making this a
legitimate concern. However, **[it is]{.underline}** **[more
likely]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**---albeit different to Cold War
deterrence---**[will hold]{.underline}**. **[Russia's deployment of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, either against Ukraine or against a NATO
member state, **[could incur]{.underline}** **[devastating
consequences]{.underline}** **[for Russia]{.underline}**.

As then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in 2018, dismissing the
notion that tactical nuclear weapons are somehow a lesser threat, "Any
nuclear weapon used ... is a strategic game-changer." Therefore, **[if
NATO]{.underline}** **[retaliates]{.underline}** **[with a powerful
response]{.underline}**, either nuclear or conventional, **[it may
target]{.underline}** **[strategic]{.underline}** **[Russian military
positions and]{.underline}** perhaps even **[sites of political
power]{.underline}**, aiming at **[wiping out]{.underline}** **[Russian
military capabilities and]{.underline}** targeting **[those in positions
of authority]{.underline}**---**[a move that could]{.underline}**
**[threaten]{.underline}** **[Putin's leadership]{.underline}**. A NATO
retaliation should therefore be considered a major threat to Putin,
especially because rivals include numerous nations with considerable
nuclear capabilities, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and
France.

In addition, **[at the]{.underline}** **[heart of this
conflict]{.underline}** **[stands]{.underline}** **[national
identity]{.underline}**. **[Putin has]{.underline}** **[little
motivation]{.underline}** **[to devastate a county that
he]{.underline}** **[wishes to annex]{.underline}** **[and
has]{.underline}** **[not knowingly made]{.underline}** any
**[preparations for using nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Fear of the
bomb accounts for one reason behind the West's decision to leave Ukraine
to fight on its own.

**[NATO's role in the]{.underline}** Middle East and North Africa
(**[MENA]{.underline}**) **[is]{.underline}**
**[politically]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[operationally
complex]{.underline}**. **[That a security and defense organization
would play an important role in a]{.underline}** **[contiguous
region]{.underline}** **[from which]{.underline}** **[numerous security
threats]{.underline}** **[emanate makes]{.underline}** intuitive
**[sense]{.underline}**. As **[NATO seeks to]{.underline}**
**[adapt]{.underline}** **[to the evolving security environment
while]{.underline}** **[revisiting its Strategic Concept]{.underline}**,
**[its]{.underline}** **[ambition]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[role]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the **[MENA]{.underline}**
**[need to be factored in]{.underline}**.

The **[security environment on NATO's]{.underline}** **[southern
periphery]{.underline}** **[is challenging]{.underline}**.
**[From]{.underline}** **[Libya]{.underline}** **[to the]{.underline}**
**[Near East]{.underline}** **[and the]{.underline}** **[Persian
Gulf]{.underline}**, the **[MENA]{.underline}**
**[concentrates]{.underline}** a fair number of **[threats that range
from]{.underline}** **[regional conflicts]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** **[state fragility]{.underline}**,
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[transnational
organized crime]{.underline}**. These **[also pose direct and indirect
risks to the security of NATO members and their
societies]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** those related to
**[uncontrolled migration]{.underline}**, **[human
insecurity]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[climate
change]{.underline}**. More recently, **[the]{.underline}**
**[reemergence of Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the
emergence of **[China]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[MENA]{.underline}** **[have made a NATO role there]{.underline}**
**[even more pertinent]{.underline}**. If Russia is in Libya and Syria,
**[both countries that]{.underline}** **[generate
insecurity]{.underline}** **[for the alliance]{.underline}**, then
**[there is an]{.underline}** **[additional rationale]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** some sort of **[presence in the
region]{.underline}**.

**[The reality is]{.underline}**, however, **[different
as]{.underline}** **[NATO]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** for long
**[struggled to assert itself as a security provider on its southern
periphery]{.underline}**. Not that it has abstained from intervening.
**[From]{.underline}** **[Libya]{.underline}** **[to the]{.underline}**
**[Mediterranean Sea]{.underline}** **[and the]{.underline}** **[Gulf of
Aden]{.underline}** **[it has been]{.underline}** **[very
present]{.underline}**, **[but the coherence and impact of its
interventions have been]{.underline}** **[fragile]{.underline}**.

Three factors can explain the difficulties that NATO is encountering in
the MENA. First, **[the]{.underline}** **[broad range]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[diffuse nature]{.underline}** **[of the threats
and risks in the region make it]{.underline}**
**[difficult]{.underline}** **[to come up with a response that
is]{.underline}** **[coherent]{.underline}** **[yet]{.underline}**
**[sufficiently targeted]{.underline}**. Simply understanding what and
where the problems are is daunting. Second, **[it follows from the
nature of the threats that NATO might not be the best-suited institution
to tackle them]{.underline}**. **[Many of the risks relate to political
or socioeconomic factors for which a military alliance
brings]{.underline}** **[little added value]{.underline}**. Third,
**[NATO's role is hindered]{.underline}** **[by the]{.underline}**
**[diverging agendas]{.underline}** **[of its members]{.underline}**.
Not only do **[allies]{.underline}** **[disagree]{.underline}** **[about
how central the region should be for NATO but some are
also]{.underline}** **[openly confronting]{.underline}** **[one another
in some of the sensitive southern theatres]{.underline}**.

### No Impact \-\-- Baltics

#### No Russian intent to infringe on the Baltics.

**Person 15**---(Associate Professor of International Relations at the
United States Military Academy). Robert Person. "6 reasons not to worry
about Russia invading the Baltics". Washington Post. November 12, 2015.

So could the Baltics be next? I don't think so, for six reasons. 1.
Vladimir Putin can't keep the Baltics out of NATO or the E.U.
International relations scholar John Mearsheimer has made a provocative
argument that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was provoked by NATO
expansion in the 1990s and 2000s. Whether or not you agree, the Baltics
made it into the club before Russia had the capacity to stop them. Some
experts have argued that one of the main reasons Russia provoked
conflict in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014 was to effectively
veto NATO membership for those countries --- because NATO would be
unlikely to let in new members with open territorial disputes. Invading
your neighbors may be a good strategy for keeping them out of NATO or
the E.U., but it's not so useful once they're already members, since it
would guarantee a catastrophic war between Russia and NATO.
**[2.]{.underline}** **[Russia will never have a seat at the table in
Baltic politics]{.underline}** In my previous post on the Monkey Cage, I
argued that **[Putin's key strategic objective in Ukraine was to install
a government in Kiev that would give Moscow a say in making Ukrainian
foreign and domestic policy.]{.underline}** But **[that couldn't happen
in the Baltics. Ever. The historical antagonism is too
strong.]{.underline}** My previous **[research on national identity in
the Baltics]{.underline}** **[shows]{.underline}** that the **[Soviet
occupation of the Baltics during WWII remains central to national memory
and identity. Russia is seen as the imperial "other" against which the
Baltics define themselves, and would never be allowed to interfere in
domestic politics.]{.underline}** What's more, Putin has so far failed
to achieve his strategic objective of installing a pliant pro-Russian
government in Kiev. Even if he imagined it possible, there's little
reason to believe he would be any more successful in the Baltics.
**[3.]{.underline}** **[The Baltics don't have the same symbolic meaning
as Ukraine and Crimea Ukraine has deep symbolic meaning for
Russia.]{.underline}** Citizens of both countries consider the ancient
empire of Kievan Rus (and its capital, Kiev) to be the cradle of eastern
Slavic civilization**[.]{.underline}** Kiev's Prince Vladimir the Great
brought Orthodox Christianity to his subjects in 988, during a golden
age of Slavic civilization that was the foundation for later
achievements by Muscovy and the Russian empire. In fact, they just
installed the cornerstone for a massive new monument to Prince Vladimir
near the Kremlin in Moscow. Parts of modern-day Ukraine had been part of
the Russian empire since the 16th century; Crimea became part of Russia
in 1783. This deep historical connection of civilizations has long made
Ukrainian independence hard for Russia to swallow. Putin once famously
remarked to George Bush: "You have to understand, George. Ukraine is not
even a country." And for most of Russia's history, he's right: Ukraine
only became a country in 1991 after centuries as the borderland of the
Russian and Soviet empires. That Ukraine took Crimea with it only made
things worse, as the peninsula was only "gifted" to the Ukrainian Soviet
Socialist Republic by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, a transfer that many
Russians saw as illegitimate both before and after the Soviet collapse.
**[Ukraine is special for Russia. The Baltics are a different
story.]{.underline}** My research has traced the territorial evolution
of Russia in the Baltic region. While the Baltics became part of the
Russian empire through the partitions of Poland in the 18th century, the
Tsars were sufficiently "hands off" to allow strong national identities
to flourish that opposed Russian domination. What's more, **[the Baltics
were independent between the world wars. When the Soviet Union forcibly
annexed them again in 1940, Baltic citizens saw it as an illegitimate
foreign occupation -- and continued to resist for the next 51
years.]{.underline}** Even as Gorbachev struggled in the dying days of
the USSR to hold together some kind of union, he knew that it would not
include the Baltic Republics, and left them out of his proposed treaty
salvaging what was left of the Soviet Union. Russia and Russians have
long recognized that the Baltics are culturally and historically
distinct from Russia, according to surveys and interviews I've conducted
across Russia and Latvia. Whether the historical and cultural importance
of Ukraine was a motivation or just a justification for Putin's actions
in Ukraine, comparable symbolism is absent in the Baltics, making them
less likely targets for Russian interference. **[4.]{.underline}**
**[Russian access to Kaliningrad is not threatened.]{.underline}** For
now. Throughout its post-Soviet history, Ukrainian leaders used the
Russian naval base in Sevastopol, Crimea, as a bargaining chip with
Russia. After the Orange Revolution of 2004-5, pro-Western President
Viktor Yushchenko announced that Ukraine would not renew Russia's lease
of the base after 2017. Though his successor, the ill-fated Viktor
Yanukovych, reversed that decision, many have argued that permanently
securing access to the base was a key strategic objective of Russia's
invasion of Crimea. Annexing the peninsula solved the strategic problem
of where to locate the Black Sea Fleet once and for all. By contrast,
**[no Baltic or Western government has ever made serious attempts to
block Russian access to the exclave of Kaliningrad]{.underline}**,
though Lithuanian officials have recognized their theoretical ability to
do so. But actually following through on the threat to cut railways,
roadways and utilities to Kaliningrad would almost certainly provoke a
Russian military response and guarantee a dangerous escalation with
potentially nuclear implications. So no country even tries. Yes,
Kaliningrad could conceivably emerge as a flashpoint, especially if
Russia uses it for an aggressive anti-access/area denial strategy.
Russian missiles based in Kaliningrad could keep NATO naval and ground
forces from reaching the Baltics in the event of a Russian attack,
isolating the three countries from the rest of the alliance at a
critical moment. But as long as Lithuania allows Russians access to the
region, war over Kaliningrad is unlikely. **[5.]{.underline}** **[Baltic
Russians are not Crimean, Donbas or Russian Russians]{.underline}** Much
of the talk of a Russian invasion of the Baltics has centered around the
ethnic Russians living there. As one reporter in Riga put it, "If Putin
felt justified in his actions against Ukraine, where 17 percent of the
population is ethnic Russian and 24 percent Russian-speaking, Latvia's
allegedly endangered minority would seem to provide him with a
convenient pretext for action." **[One social activist in Latvia
warned]{.underline}** about what many observers fear: "Military
aggression in the old style --- tanks crossing the border --- is not
likely here. ... But what they call **[a hybrid offensive]{.underline}**
**[--- provocations, a media war --- that is very possible and hard to
defend against."]{.underline}** Hybrid warfare combines conventional and
unconventional modes of warfare, bringing the battle to new
battlegrounds. As retired Col. John McCuen writes, "the decisive battles
in today's hybrid wars are fought not on conventional battlegrounds, but
on asymmetric battlegrounds within the conflict zone population, the
home front population and the international community population." Thus,
many have speculated that the Russian minorities of the Baltics could
offer Russia a sympathetic target population to use as its launching pad
for a hybrid invasion, just as it used the native separatist movements
in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine as cover for hybrid warfare. **[I don't
think that's likely.]{.underline}** I recently wrote in the Moscow Times
that **[the Baltic Russians are not particularly amenable to Russian
hybrid warfare. Though they have many lingering grievances over
language, cultural and citizenship policies, these grievances have not
translated into separatism.]{.underline}** More and more ethnic Russians
have gained citizenship in the Baltic States and increasingly seem to
hold the view of Nils Ušakovs, the ethnically Russian mayor of Latvia's
capital city, Riga: "I was born here. ... I'm a Latvian national; a
Russian-speaking Latvian who is a patriot of my country." This attitude
is especially prevalent among the younger generation of Baltic Russians,
who increasingly see themselves as European and enjoy the benefits of
living in the European Union. **[Even the older generations who still
feel a stronger connection to Russia can see the contrast in living
standards between Russia and the Baltics.]{.underline}** Katri Raik is
the director of Narva College in Estonia, which caters to Estonia's
Russian population, and compares Narva with the Russian city Ivangorod
that sits just across the river: **[What would happen if Narva were to
hold a referendum?]{.underline}** Would its residents want to live in
Estonia or in Putin's Russia? **[Anyone]{.underline}** with any common
sense ... **[would want to live in Estonia. Because life here is better,
more stable, the pensions are higher]{.underline}**, we have social
welfare. People in Narva know what they would choose because they often
travel to Ivangorod. Research by Ammon Cheskin confirms this point.
While Baltic Russians maintain a close cultural affinity with Russia,
Russia's political and economic attraction is much lower.

### No Impact \-\-- AT Cohesion

#### Nato cohesion impacts are empirically disproven.

A few months ago, **[acute divisions plagued the United States, the

**[Germany]{.underline}**, Europe's leading nation, had **[developed a

**[Poland]{.underline}**, a frontline state now aligned against Russia,
was **[descending deeper into autocracy, inviting punitive measures from
its EU partners. A mendacious Tory prime minister led the United
Kingdom]{.underline}**. **[The US, damaged by Trumpism, a mismanaged

**[External risks]{.underline}**. The **[participants found
it]{.underline}** **[questionable]{.underline}** **[whether allies will
be able to find a]{.underline}** **[common conventional
threat]{.underline}** **[that would be]{.underline}** perceived as
**[strong enough to]{.underline}** "**[transcend]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[domestic pressures]{.underline}** **[and
the]{.underline}** **[concept of sovereignty]{.underline}**." Although
an absence of external threat to the Alliance is very unlikely, **[the
future risk will lie in]{.underline}** **[multiplication]{.underline}**
**[of external threats and a]{.underline}** **[lack]{.underline}** **[of
common perception of those threats]{.underline}**.

This **[underdeveloped]{.underline}** **[common understanding of
external threats]{.underline}**, accompanied by differential threat
assessments, **[could]{.underline}** **[weaken]{.underline}** **[NATO's
cohesion]{.underline}**. To illustrate this point, although the survey
participants listed the failure to activate Article 5 in case of attack
as a potential risk, further discussions showed that **[non-Article 5
missions]{.underline}** **[could constitute the]{.underline}** **[real
test]{.underline}** **[for NATO's cohesion]{.underline}**. In words of
the one of participants, "**[if there is an operation and]{.underline}**
**[only two nations]{.underline}** **[show up]{.underline}**, **[this
is]{.underline}** **[not cohesion]{.underline}**."

For some nations, **[this]{.underline}** **[threat
multiplication]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[dissimilar threat
perceptions]{.underline}** **[can lead to an]{.underline}**
**[operational overstretch]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}** to an
eventual "**[mission creep]{.underline}**." In contrast, **[other
nations might develop an]{.underline}** **[excessive sense of
security]{.underline}** **[that would]{.underline}** lead them to
**[reduce]{.underline}** **[their attention and]{.underline}**
**[willingness]{.underline}** **[to participate in NATO
activities]{.underline}**. For this reason, **[terrorism]{.underline}**,
**[for instance]{.underline}**, **[cannot]{.underline}** **[constitute
NATO's defining threat]{.underline}**. Additionally, **[the changing
nature of threats to allies' security will require
domestic]{.underline}**, **[nonmilitary means]{.underline}** **[to
address them]{.underline}**, **[rather than alliance-wide military
measures]{.underline}**. In other words, "nations will be looking inside
to maintain order."

**[Political and economic factors]{.underline}**. The group of political
and economic factors points to the **[risks of]{.underline}** **[severe
disagreements]{.underline}** **[among]{.underline}** the
**[allies]{.underline}**, **[which could lead to the]{.underline}**
**[weakening]{.underline}** **[of the transatlantic bond]{.underline}**,
**[disintegration tendencies]{.underline}** within the European Union,
**[or even]{.underline}** **[withdrawal]{.underline}** **[of a NATO
nation from the Alliance]{.underline}**.

At the level of political elites, the **[participants identified the
crisis of political leadership in NATO nations among the]{.underline}**
**[most probable causes]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** **[weakening
alliance cohesion]{.underline}** in the future. Particularly,
**[populist leaders who prefer narrow]{.underline}**,
**[short-term]{.underline}** **[political gains at home and who are
prepared to]{.underline}** "**[undermine]{.underline}** **[an
international institution to gain consensus]{.underline}**
**[internally]{.underline}**" **[represent a]{.underline}** **[serious
threat]{.underline}** **[to multilateralism]{.underline}**, **[on which
the Alliance has]{.underline}** **[depended]{.underline}**. Oftentimes,
**[national leaders]{.underline}** "**[use]{.underline}**
**[NATO]{.underline}** **[as a]{.underline}**
**[scapegoat]{.underline}** **[for their domestic political
games]{.underline}**," while "NATO does not \[and cannot\] fight its own
nations."

At the level of domestic population, the **[support for the
Alliance]{.underline}** in member states **[can decline due to
NATO's]{.underline}** **[unclear purpose]{.underline}**. **[This could
become an]{.underline}** **[acute problem]{.underline}**, especially
**[if national leaders]{.underline}** continue to **[frame security
problems]{.underline}** **[exclusively]{.underline}** **[in domestic
terms]{.underline}** instead of treating them as NATO-wide.
Particularly, **[concerns over sovereignty]{.underline}** **[could
override the relative value of the Alliance's]{.underline}**
**[collective good]{.underline}** **[and make governments]{.underline}**
**[pull]{.underline}** limited funds **[away]{.underline}** **[from
NATO]{.underline}**.

In a similar vein, **[demographic shifts]{.underline}** **[changing the
socioeconomic and cultural fabric of nations]{.underline}**, **[such as
an]{.underline}** **[aging population]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[migration]{.underline}**, **[will drive
differences in]{.underline}** **[fiscal priorities]{.underline}**,
**[which could result in]{.underline}** **[decreasing]{.underline}**
**[national defense spending]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[if
the]{.underline}** **[free-riding behavior]{.underline}**
**[reaches]{.underline}** **[critical proportions]{.underline}**
**[within NATO burden sharing]{.underline}**, **[it can
create]{.underline}**, out of those who bear their fair share, **[a
group of allies]{.underline}** **[disinterested]{.underline}** **[in
defending free-riding nations]{.underline}**, **[as they could cease to
see]{.underline}** "**[return on their investment]{.underline}**."

**[Organizational structures and processes]{.underline}**. This
project's focus groups concluded that **[NATO's]{.underline}** **[rigid
organizational processes]{.underline}** that **[hold onto the
past]{.underline}** could **[result in an Alliance]{.underline}**
"**[unable to evolve]{.underline}** **[with member states' national
interests]{.underline}**." **[Bureaucratic politics within the Alliance
structures could cause NATO's]{.underline}** **[slow
adaptation]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[contemporary needs and
values]{.underline}**. For instance, the **[participants listed
the]{.underline}** **[top-down defense planning process]{.underline}**
**[of determining capability requirements as a case where the Alliance
and evolving national interests]{.underline}** **[do not
align]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[civil-military frictions]{.underline}** on both NATO and
national levels **[could]{.underline}** **[negatively
affect]{.underline}** **[readiness]{.underline}** of the forces. Long
**[decision-making processes and]{.underline}**
**[underdeveloped]{.underline}** **[institutional procedures
in]{.underline}** **[national headquarters]{.underline}** **[could
prevent the Alliance from developing a]{.underline}** **[legal
framework]{.underline}** **[for a]{.underline}** **[common
course]{.underline}** **[of action under the NATO flag]{.underline}**;
**[for instance]{.underline}**, **[in addressing]{.underline}** **[new
adversaries]{.underline}** **[that use]{.underline}** **[unconventional
means such as cyber]{.underline}**. Put simply, NATO cannot be faster
than the individual countries that make it up.

Lastly, **[size matters]{.underline}**; **[cohesion is]{.underline}**
**[more difficult to forge]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[maintain]{.underline}** **[in an]{.underline}** **[ever-enlarging
alliance]{.underline}**, especially **[when]{.underline}**
**[increasingly divergent]{.underline}** **[national interests tend
to]{.underline}** **[change]{.underline}** **[the modus operandi of the
Alliance]{.underline}**. More rather than less often, **[NATO's
international staff will need to find compromise]{.underline}**
**[during its decision-making processes between a political and formal
equality]{.underline}** hoped to enhance Alliance cohesion on the one
hand and the desirable Alliance effectiveness on the other hand.

**[Technology advances]{.underline}**. The participants agreed that
[technology advances are]{.underline} **[important]{.underline}** [fo**r
NATO's continued** cohesion]{.underline}. [Technology will constitute
a]{.underline} **[significant intervening factor]{.underline}** [in how
NATO nations **maintain**]{.underline} their [cohesion in the
future]{.underline} for three reasons. First,
**[ever-evolving]{.underline}** [communication technology can facilitate
the]{.underline} **[spread of risks]{.underline}** coming from outside
of the Alliance [and]{.underline} **[exacerbate]{.underline}** [their
negative effect]{.underline}. The [examples that resonated]{.underline}
**[the most]{.underline}** during focus group sessions [are]{.underline}
**[information warfare]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[targeted
propaganda]{.underline}** against NATO nations. Internet
**[communications technology]{.underline}** [creates]{.underline}
**[infinite room]{.underline}** [for alternative media that]{.underline}
**[distort reality]{.underline}**, [contribute to]{.underline} the
emergence of populist and **[radical movements]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}** [the danger of]{.underline}
**[miscommunication]{.underline}** among nations.

Second, **[NATO risks]{.underline}** **[losing]{.underline}** **[the
innovation game to the]{.underline}** **[commercial defense industrial
sector]{.underline}**. In the future, **[private
companies]{.underline}** will continue to **[stay ahead]{.underline}**
of NATO **[in designing specifications and setting standards for
platforms]{.underline}**. This can have a major impact on readiness and
interoperability among NATO nations if their innovation efforts (e.g.,
the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) do not materialize.31

Third, **[some nations may become]{.underline}**
**[reluctant]{.underline}** to **[share their latest technology
acquisitions]{.underline}**, especially if they put private gains above
the collective endeavor. **[This would pose a challenge]{.underline}**
"**[for]{.underline}** **[anyone to share information]{.underline}**
they own **[without gaining any profit]{.underline}** for themselves."
**[The]{.underline}** **[political unwillingness]{.underline}**
**[may]{.underline}** **[feed distrust]{.underline}**, **[which can
result in a]{.underline}** **[deepening]{.underline}**
**[interoperability gap between allies on the
battlefield]{.underline}**, and ultimately, **[a]{.underline}** **[less
cohesive Alliance]{.underline}**.

**[Core values]{.underline}**. The **[participants acknowledged that
shared values]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[identity]{.underline}** **[mean that allies]{.underline}** **[do not
represent]{.underline}** **[a threat to each other]{.underline}**.
**[NATO's core liberal-democratic values]{.underline}**, defined in the
Preamble and Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, **[further frame
the]{.underline}** **[nonadversarial culture]{.underline}** **[of the
Alliance's internal relational dynamics]{.underline}**.32
**[Yet]{.underline}**, although core values scored high in the survey,
the **[discussions revealed the]{.underline}**
**[disagreement]{.underline}** **[about whether they are]{.underline}**
**[more crucial for cohesion]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}**
**[national interests]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}**.

The **[findings indicated that the]{.underline}** **[general
problem]{.underline}** with core values **[relates to the]{.underline}**
**[intangibility]{.underline}** **[of the common good that NATO
produces]{.underline}**. **[If the Alliance is
successful]{.underline}**, "**[nothing happens]{.underline}**," **[which
leads nations to take peace]{.underline}**, **[security]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[stability for granted]{.underline}**. This
**[can affect the]{.underline}** **[overall understanding]{.underline}**
**[of NATO's purpose among domestic populations]{.underline}**. Due to
an unknown or unclear purpose of NATO, this "we-feeling" can disappear.

Moreover, the **[rise of populism]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[radical nationalism]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
**[authoritarian inclinations]{.underline}**, further **[fueled by
hybrid]{.underline}**, **[cyber]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}**
**[information warfare]{.underline}** coming from Russia, **[appears
threatening]{.underline}** **[to NATO's core values and will create
frictions]{.underline}** [within NATO]{.underline}. Arguably, the
Islamic State also uses a "**[strategy of chaos]{.underline}**"
**[intended to divide the NATO nations and to destroy the cohesion
within and among their societies]{.underline}**. Further regarding
authoritarian regimes, the **[participants mentioned that the Alliance
should]{.underline}** **[think twice]{.underline}** **[before
establishing a partnership with]{.underline}** yet **[another
country]{.underline}**.

Additionally, some participants [believed that the continuing migration
to Europe from the Middle East and Nor**th Africa**]{.underline} region
**[would]{.underline}** **[change the fabric]{.underline}** of the
European societies. European societies might drift apart due to the
different paces of change in their identities and values.

To conclude, **[although there was no consensus]{.underline}** **[among
the participants on the degree to which common values play a role in
NATO and its cohesion]{.underline}**, **[sufficiently aligned
interests]{.underline}** **[of NATO nations]{.underline}**, together
with a shared purpose of NATO, **[constitute a definite
precondition]{.underline}** **[for a cohesive Alliance]{.underline}**.

### Impact Turn \-\-- Cohesion = Russia War

#### NATO cohesion is worse -- causes the alliance to pursue more punitive measures which provokes Russian backlash.

Of course, **[unfocused actions bred largely of self-regard were always
doomed to fail]{.underline}**. **[Take, for instance, sanctions, widely
hailed as projecting Western resolve against Putinism.]{.underline}**
Ineffective against even toothless regimes such as Cuba, **[sanctions
have predictably failed to deter the Russian leader while exposing
billions across the world to steep inflation and hunger]{.underline}**.
**[Additional punitive measures have been very selectively imposed, with
more focus on maintaining unity than on the political, economic and
social repercussions for a world that has barely recovered from two
radically destructive years of the pandemic.]{.underline}** It should
not be surprising that **[most nations, including close Western allies
such as India and Turkey, continue to do business with
Russia,]{.underline}** or that **[Putin has retaliated by blockading
ports that supply the world with wheat and fertilizers. Now convinced of
their own rhetoric about the strength of the Western coalition, US
politicians and commentators have clamored to change the regime in
Moscow and fatally weaken Russia, with no reference to how such
fantasies of supreme power worked out in Iraq, Afghanistan and
Libya.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, three months into the war, these same
figures seem no closer to defining realistic Western objectives in
Ukraine. In fact, **[the options before the US and Europe have always
been blindingly clear. They could throw their full support behind
Ukraine's resistance to Russia, make sanctions watertight and cut off
all financial support for Putin's war machine. Or they could bring
forward the unavoidable obligation to talk to their enemies and offer
incentives for both Ukraine and Russia to reach a negotiated
solution.]{.underline}** The first option is scarcely ideal. **[Nations
that depend on Russia for its energy and food needs won't end their
relationship with the country overnight --- not even
Germany]{.underline}** will do so. Also, increasingly **[direct military
confrontation with a nuclear-armed state is unwise.]{.underline}** Yet
**[the second option is hardly being vigorously pursued right
now]{.underline}**. Thus, **[Ukraine receives from the West neither the
weapons it seeks for a more fruitful war effort, nor sufficient
motivation to pursue peace through diplomacy.]{.underline}** What we do
get, in copious measure, is a psychodrama --- of a tiny but powerful
minority of politicians and journalists who have been trying to resolve
the identity crisis of the West by rhetorically exaggerating its will
and resources against Putin. During his four years in power, US
President Donald **[Trump wrecked the cold war idea of the West as free,
democratic and rational. In Europe, hard-right movements and
personalities that were openly admiring of Putin further blurred a
Western self-image forged during the long confrontation with
totalitarian Soviet communism.]{.underline}** A brazenly imperialist
Russia has now appeared to cleanse and vivify that identity just as the
Soviet Union once did. **[Declarations that "the West must hold its
nerve," even as death and destruction stalk Ukraine, fuel the suspicion
that achieving some kumbaya moment of synchronized purpose and identity
has become more vital to the West than averting a global humanitarian
catastrophe]{.underline}**. Needless to say, **[old
assumptions]{.underline}** --- **[of a singular West possessed of
colossal power or prestige or nerve --- cannot be sustained today by a
profoundly fragile coalition of Western countries which are internally
divided, with angry populations pursuing widely different
socio-political destinies.]{.underline}** It is true that many members
of the West's political and media elites, mostly middle-aged, white and
male, fundamentally experienced the world as its hegemons. Too many
disorientating things have happened since they were young --- among
them, the rise of China, a country nursing its sense of humiliation by
Western powers, and the re-emergence of a defeated rival Russia as an
energy superpower. Faced with such resentful and implacable challengers,
they have naturally sought shelter in the easy certainties and slogans
of their youth. But **[peace and stability in the world will depend on
whether today's fragmented West can find less treacherous ways of
dealing with the rest]{.underline}**.

**[without a]{.underline}** far more strategic,
**[centralized]{.underline}**, and **[White House-driven approach to the
challenges ahead]{.underline}**. **[We are at the]{.underline}**

strategies]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** kind of **[defensive]{.underline}**, **[on-the-fly
responses]{.underline}** **[we've seen on artificial intelligence and 5G
telecommunications]{.underline}**.

**[At some point]{.underline}** in the 1970s, **[Republicans
and]{.underline}** eventually **[Democrats began to develop an
allergy]{.underline}** **[to anything that resembled]{.underline}**
**[government direction of industry]{.underline}**,
**[even]{.underline}** if it was predicated **[on national security
grounds]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** **[central
role]{.underline}** **[that government played in]{.underline}**
**[industrial planning]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[policy]{.underline}** in the Second World War and continued to play
through the early Cold War **[was]{.underline}**
**[dismissed]{.underline}** **[as an aberration]{.underline}**.
**[With]{.underline}** **[supply-side economics]{.underline}**
**[ascendant since the Nixon presidency]{.underline}**, **[the argument
for]{.underline}** a **[laissez-faire]{.underline}** approach toward
**[industry prospered]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** **[less
government direction]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[better,
and the economy will organically innovate]{.underline}**, **[the
thinking]{.underline}** went (and **[goes]{.underline}**).

**[Fast-forward to the present]{.underline}**, and **[it's
a]{.underline}** **[different world]{.underline}**. U.S.
**[competitors]{.underline}** around the world **[are]{.underline}**
**[anything but laissez-faire]{.underline}** **[with their national
industrial policies]{.underline}**. **[China]{.underline}** has
**[launched]{.underline}** an **[ambitious industrial plan
on]{.underline}** **[key technologies]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[innovations]{.underline}**
**[through]{.underline}** its "**[Made in China 2025]{.underline}**"
initiative. President **[Xi Jinping has been clear]{.underline}** **[on
the need to seize what]{.underline}** "**[presents the Chinese people
with an opportunity you rarely see in a]{.underline}** **[thousand
years]{.underline}**." **[Russia]{.underline}** has **[maintained
a]{.underline}** **[heavy hand]{.underline}** **[in protecting and
promoting those industries]{.underline}** **[key]{.underline}** **[to
its national security]{.underline}**, **[even]{.underline}** **[as it
becomes a global innovation laggard]{.underline}**. U.S. **[allies and
partners from]{.underline}** **[France]{.underline}** to
**[Germany]{.underline}**, **[Japan]{.underline}** to
**[Israel]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[South
Korea]{.underline}** to **[Singapore]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** also **[put into place strategies and policies to
grow]{.underline}** **[domestic industries]{.underline}**
**[around]{.underline}** **[emerging technologies]{.underline}** **[and
to]{.underline}** **[foster innovation]{.underline}** **[in areas of
national priority]{.underline}**. They've looked intensely at everything
from focused R&D to scaling up technologies and upskilling workforces
for the changes underway.

**[None of this is your grandfather's or grandmother's industrial
policy]{.underline}**. **[It's aimed at the cutting edge of
tech]{.underline}**, and it's hardly a socialist approach. Instead,
**[it's an effort by]{.underline}** **[national
governments]{.underline}** **[to concentrate existing resources and
infuse capital smartly to address the most important elements of future
science and technology and manufacturing competitiveness]{.underline}**.
To be sure, this is something the United States has also done over this
time frame but in a largely balkanized way that depends on informal
networks, one-off initiatives, and few economies of scale. **[The type
of White House leadership on these issues seen during the Cold
War]{.underline}** **[has been missing]{.underline}**. There has been
plenty of talk of "moonshots" but little implementation of them.

**[As a result]{.underline}**, **[America is achieving]{.underline}**
**[far less than its potential]{.underline}** **[across a]{.underline}**
**[range of technologies]{.underline}** **[in which its]{.underline}**
**[early lead]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[rapidly
diminishing]{.underline}**: **[artificial intelligence]{.underline}** to
**[additive manufacturing]{.underline}**, **[electric
vehicles]{.underline}** to **[unmanned systems]{.underline}**,
**[etc]{.underline}**. And at an economy-wide level, **[the United
States is]{.underline}** **[failing]{.underline}** **[to take advantage
of what the]{.underline}** **[Fourth Industrial
Revolution]{.underline}** **[can offer for]{.underline}** **[reshoring
manufacturing]{.underline}** **[and creating new]{.underline}**,
good-paying **[jobs as some of these technologies transform
the]{.underline}** **[overall economy]{.underline}** **[and
risk]{.underline}** **[large-scale labor dislocation]{.underline}**. An
argument can also be made that the innovation economy is becoming
dangerously concentrated, with big companies getting bigger and less
room for the innovation that startup companies bring. **[Strategic
investments by the government could change that]{.underline}**.

**[America's]{.underline}** **[collective amnesia]{.underline}** **[on
the]{.underline}** **[past success]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
**[government industrial policy intervention]{.underline}** **[is
puzzling]{.underline}**. Nearly **[every major U.S. technological

**[Despite]{.underline}** broad **[lip service]{.underline}** **[to that

to address them. **[Protecting U.S. industry on these issues isn't

NATO and Technological Change: Three Pillars of AI Governance This
section considers three pillars where **[NATO has procedures and
competency to operationalize AI governance through both mechanisms of
policy alignment and standards, and enhance security in the
international environment.]{.underline}** The pillars reflect
foundational issue areas constitutive of governance but are also issue
areas where previous scholars have cautioned as particularly challenging
in the AI governance space. **[The three pillars---(1) ethics and
values, (2) legal norms, and (3) safety and security---are meant to
illustrate three conditions for NATO to facilitate policy and standards
harmonization.]{.underline}** Importantly, these pillars are not
exhaustive areas in which NATO will need to consider governance
structures to responsibly implement AI technology, but rather highlight
particular issues that researchers and analysts acknowledge as
significant hurdles in navigating AI governance (see Table 69.2).54
Core, shared values at foundation of Alliance's political cohesion that
informs civilian oversight of operations and overall institutional
effectiveness; included in principles **[Alignment between differing
legal interpretations between Allies, particularly as affects the
ability of forces to communicate and interoperate in dynamic contexts;
constant calibration of policies based on legal
interpretations]{.underline}** Strategic planning for maintaining
integrity of information in military operations and transparency
measures that reinforce democratic accountability; setting priorities on
defensive systems and countermeasures to protect from motivated attacks
and intentional failure modes of AI-enabled weapon systems NATO
Standardization and Certification **[Basis of standards reinforcing
responsible state behavior (see legal norms) and responsible engineering
practices (see safety and security); human-centric views of
responsibility and accountability also embedded in technical adoption
measures]{.underline}** Precedents of legal standards dealing with
international humanitarian law, including detention standards and
training publications Certification frameworks and technical, human, and
procedural standards to prevent emergent behavior and enhance robustness
and resilience of systems to behave predictably in conflict environments
The first pillar considers **[NATO's role in the evolution of ethical
and values-driven AI.]{.underline}** One ongoing debate **[regarding AI
as a military technology]{.underline}** is the **[ethical implications
and baseline values the Allies, and others, want infused in the
development and adoption of AI.]{.underline}** The **[Allies themselves
lack uniform consensus on numerous, substantial ethical questions on the
use of AI]{.underline}**, as most clearly seen in the adjacent area of
the ethics of autonomy in weapons systems including lethal autonomous
weapon systems (LAWS). In this discussion, we spotlight **[NATO's role
in facilitating and shaping ethical harmonization as an operational
requirement to ensure successful future missions.]{.underline}** The
second pillar examines **[legal norms as a domain wherein legal
uncertainty regarding AI has tangible implications for Allied legal
interoperability, a subset of larger coalition
interoperability]{.underline}**. Thus far, the legal debate regarding AI
has been largely fixed on the issue of a treaty banning the use of LAWS.
In this section, we advocate for a more nuanced legal picture in which
**[NATO can facilitate legal coordination and tackle some of the
foundational legal issues which will prevent successful legal
interoperability in future operations.]{.underline}** The third pillar
identifies **[safety and security of AI systems as prerequisite to
trustworthy and responsible AI in any context, but especially so for the
conduct of military activity.]{.underline}** At the NATO level, Allied
forces must **[ensure their systems interoperate safely and predictably
both to ensure effective command and control (C2) internally, and to
prevent disruptions from attacks. It is a foundational facet of
coordination that shows the overlap between NATO interests in military
effectiveness and incentivization for responsible
innovation]{.underline}**.

#### NATO key to the development of ethical AI

Ethics and values One of the vital aspects of AI which has garnered
significant global attention is the ethical implications of artificial
intelligence as a military technology---an issue that has divided much
of the global community, including NATO member states. As a starting
point, researchers and analysts have considered the implications of
emerging military technology in terms of ethical responsibility and
regulation, especially as states and organizations continue to release
AI ethical principles, guidelines, and standards.55 We explore how
**[NATO can operationalize the debate around ethics and values of
military AI to garner coordination and continue progress of EDT
harmonization among partners]{.underline}**. Building on the theoretical
discussion from STS and military innovation literature above, **[the
adoption of technologies that reinforce values serves the strategic
interest of NATO to shape technological innovation against current waves
of illiberalism.]{.underline}** Additionally, infusing AI development
with certain ethical principles and values can have operational
advantages and benefits, and **[NATO can, in particular, promote the
ethical principles as operational standards for the
Allies.]{.underline}** A common critique within the ethics debate is
that approaching new technology with an ethical or democratic
values-driven perspective translates into comparative military
disadvantage. Essentially, if your adversary develops technology without
the constraints of ethical principles then there will be diminished
effectiveness on the battlefield.56 We find this critique unfounded
because it assumes there is a false trade-off between ethics and
effectiveness; instead, we argue ethical foundations are built into the
architecture of modern warfare.57 As such, ethics is a background
condition for battlefield effectiveness, which is already infused in
military decision-making and helping to guide the boundaries of
international humanitarian law. As such, ethical guidelines do not have
to detract from a military's capacity or competency to devise means and
methods of warfare that will serve their national or coalition
interest.58 If anything, a first-mover advantage can incentivize an
ethical and values-driven AI to establish the threshold of technological
standards globally.59 **[The political dimension of the Alliance rests
on the bedrock of a shared commitment to the "principles of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law," as enshrined in the
foundational North Atlantic Treaty of 1949.60 Shared values are
important for NATO operations because they help constitute their
legitimacy.]{.underline}** In addition to the North Atlantic Council
exerting civilian oversight over NATO operations, legitimacy also
includes respect for international legal principles including the core
principles of international humanitarian law, or the laws of armed
conflict, distinction, proportionality, and necessity. Without political
oversight and legitimacy, NATO's military power would be less effective
at shaping norms and promoting stability in the international system.
**[The introduction of AI means that NATO has the moral and strategic
imperative to adopt technologies that confer legitimacy and responsible
innovation.61 Acting on a shared commitment to democratic values is
vital to the political cohesion of the NATO Alliance, just as much as it
is a determinant of military effectiveness in a predictable security
environment.]{.underline}** Put simply, shared values are important to
both political and operational coherence between Allies. In its 2018
Framework for Future Alliance Operations, the strategic command Allied
Command Transformation urged discussion of the legal and ethical
dimensions of technological advancement to both know how it would impact
NATO decision-making and how the Alliance would be prepared to address
adversaries who do not share in that vision.62 As such, NATO is
contending with the ways that ethical AI impacts its own cohesion
internally and how differences between allies may project outward in the
face of competitors whose ethical frameworks and commitment to the rule
of law differ. Internally, there is a strong national government
commitment to responsible AI. Recently, transatlantic cooperation has
initiated partnerships of largely NATO states committed to advancing
responsible AI with goals towards data sharing and future
interoperability.63 AI defense partnerships are not restricted to
military innovation but rather aim to facilitate civilian innovation
cooperation for defense purposes. Externally, as AI-enabled autonomous
systems enter the arsenals of more technologically advanced countries,
uncoordinated ethical frameworks between Allies could pose operational
risks. Without wider alignment, AI systems will have "varying technical
specifications based on the legal and policy decisions made by
individual governments when answering the key questions."64 Further,
although one motivation of autonomous systems is the increased safety of
military personnel by removing them from dangerous situations, the lack
of alignment could lead some Allies to perceive other capitals'
deployments of unmanned forces as a lack of commitment to put lives on
the line, therein posing credibility risks for Allies to assure one
another.65 These credibility risks can be mitigated by accountability
and verification standards and procedures that NATO can implement for
multinational operations, and efforts to institutionalize these
procedures for AI are underway.66 While the NATO AI Strategy is expected
to create a common foundation for the Alliance's pursuit of AI, it is
the implementation of principles for safe, ethical, legal, and
interoperable AI that will reveal how coherent different national
perspectives are. As of August 2021, only the United States and France
have publicly issued their military AI strategies.67 Other allies,
including Canada and the United Kingdom, have emerging views on
responsible military AI, but little official information about how they
implement their ethical risk assessments is publicly available.68
**[NATO's influence in the functioning of joint operations and
multinational military operations situates the Alliance to coordinate
between how Allies implement ethical principles in their own national AI
development.]{.underline}** Specifically, **[NATO is well-situated to
advocate for transparency, accountability, and data governance, which
are also adoption factors that can translate into operational benefits,
among other values.]{.underline}**69 For example, **[these factors can
promote coordination among Allies on ethical guidelines on the
development and use of AI, as this will be a necessary foundation in any
future joint operation that uses this technology.]{.underline}** "The
transatlantic partnership must focus on coordinating these core
principles and systematic governance to ensure AI systems development
aligns with the rule of law and democracy. In particular, this must
ensure answering questions about human dignity, human control, and
accountability ... **[NATO remains the organization that can bring these
two (U.S. and EU) together and establishes the ethical bottom
line."]{.underline}**70 The issues of transparency and accountability
will define the scope of future implementation. Many remaining questions
and uncertainty will be addressed in NATO's forthcoming AI ethical
principles guidelines. But the guidelines adopted in 2021 do not address
every ethical dilemma. Regarding accountability, especially, likely
major questions will continue to affect the Alliance. As Assistant
Secretary-General for Emerging Security Challenges David van Weel
recently clarified, NATO will offer a framework of responsible use for
the Allies---but the question of accountability for member states, as
opposed to civilian technology manufacturers for example, is one
principle that will not have an easy solution.71

#### NATO key to international norms setting and legal interoperability -- other alliances don't solve.

International legal norms In certain respects, the legal debate mirrors
much of the ethical debate surrounding AI as the two address many of the
same issues. International law is a values-based system embedded in
certain principles and practices agreed-upon within the international
system. This section certainly identifies the complementarity of the
ethical discussion surrounding AI, but it also illustrates where the
legal debate can depart from the ethical considerations to address
different sorts of legal challenges that face the Alliance. Lawyers,
researchers, and civil society grapple with existing legal regimes
relevant to military operations and the uncertainty and ambiguity
surrounding automated decision-making, particularly in lethal
decision-making. Thus far, the legal dialogue has been heavily anchored
in the applicability of international humanitarian law (IHL), and other
relevant legal regimes, to lethal autonomous weapons systems.72 IHL,
also known as the laws of war or the laws of armed conflict, regulate
the means and methods of warfare and, as such, is pivotal to the
emergence of military technology and how existing legal structures are
disrupted. The legal debate often revolves around the prospect of a
"treaty ban" of LAWS.73 But the legal debate is much more nuanced than
the likelihood of international treaties banning any particular weapon
system. Especially because NATO is not a regulatory body, it cannot
institute measures to regulate emerging technology for the Allies.
Instead, NATO's function in the legal domain may be more effective
outside the traditional legal debates around emerging military
technology and more embedded in fostering cooperation and coordination
among military partners. Other avenues of legal regulation may fall
short of an international convention or prohibition, but nevertheless
factor significantly in regulating and/or delineating state policies.
Additionally, non-lethal applications of AI, as well as applications of
AI that do not figure into autonomous systems, also raise important
legal questions under international law. Arguably, norms around
non-lethal applications are more urgent as their development is more
advanced, harder to define, and less controversial in integration.74
Ultimately, NATO's facilitative power can help ensure that integration
of EDTs like AI into military capabilities and into multinational
coalition operations is consistent with member states' legal
obligations. **[One vital and unique contribution for NATO is
facilitating legal interoperability among the Allies to resolve some of
the most pressing legal barriers for AI implementation in future Allied
operations. Legal interoperability, a subset of larger coalition
interoperability, refers to the operational coordination around partner
legal obligations and interpretations.75]{.underline}** It ensures "that
**[within a military alliance, military operations can be conducted
effectively consistent with the legal obligations of each
nation]{.underline}**."76 Legal interoperability is a critical component
of multilateral operations that has thus far been under-examined,
despite its centrality to successful military operations. This is
largely because "**[legal factors have a bearing on everything in
alliances and coalition operations---from determining basic
'troop-to-task' considerations to decisions regarding the targets to be
engaged---and the types of ordinances that may be
used."]{.underline}**77 **[To enhance legal interoperability, NATO can
exert its influence on how Allies can develop and deploy AI consistent
with their legal obligations through its unique standardization
capacities]{.underline}**. Historically, **[NATO has taken significant
steps to bridge the legal gap between Allies on critical procedures that
bridge responsible state behavior with such "troop-to-task"
considerations.]{.underline}** One instructive example from past
operations is detention policies in non-international armed conflicts.78
**[The promulgation of detention standards illustrates the operational
significance of NATO's common legal procedures]{.underline}**, even for
coalitions of the willing that formally operate outside NATO structures.
By way of background, the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan had internal
debates regarding the 96-hour security detention time period.79 The
United States advocated extending the 96-hour rule, where coalition
partners insisted adhering to the NATO standard, even though it was not
a NATO operation.80 Generally **[the detention example illustrates NATO
legal standards providing clarity to non-NATO operations; in some cases,
Allies adopt NATO standards as accepted thresholds that continue to
inform coalition policies beyond NATO structures and
operations.]{.underline}** Implementing AI in future military operations
will almost certainly complicate legal interoperability as there is a
lack of uniform standards, as in the detention example. Even some of the
more basic implementation measures will garner legal uncertainty and
Allies will inevitably navigate with minimal legal clarity and no
standard procedures. Despite the roots of the legal debate stemming from
the question of lethality, the most pressing (and urgent) legal issues
will address the integration of necessary AI-enablers, such as data
gathering and sharing. Furthermore, NATO has coordinated initiatives to
promote awareness of Allies' legal obligations and has a dedicated
office focusing on legality. This centralizes the institutional capacity
to focus on alignment not only between the policies of NATO Allies, but
coherence with the international community more broadly. Among others,
the NATO Legal Practitioners' Workshop and inter-organizational dialogue
between NATO, the UN, and the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), the latter of which has a delegation to NATO that provides legal
training and education to practitioners.81 The NATO Office of Legal
Affairs (OLA) itself can also play a central role in navigating the
challenges to legal interoperability. As the example of detention
standards illustrates, NATO has been successful in implementing legal
standards which translated into operational clarity and coalition policy
outside NATO operations. As part of its focus on responsibility in its
EDT agenda, NATO has opportunities to facilitate AI legal
standard-setting and coalition policies to ensure safer and responsible
use of AI in Allied operations.

Safety and security For humans to meet ethical and legal commitments
when developing and deploying AI, the systems themselves must be safe,
secure, and reliable. More simply put, if humans and institutions
interacting with AI do not have confidence that the systems will perform
as expected, then they cannot assure that its development and deployment
are responsible. This makes safety and security a key pillar of
responsible AI governance for any actor.82 As this section explores for
NATO in particular, **[safety and security are indispensable to the
Alliance's stated goals to focus its approach to EDTs in the areas of
"deterrence and defense, capability development, legal and ethical
norms, and arms control aspects."83]{.underline}** Politically,
democratic militaries using AI cannot be accountable to their
citizenries nor their coalition partners if they lack mechanisms to
trace and explain how their systems are reliable. Accidents and
interference with AI systems could likewise create political risks for
the Alliance. For example, if deepfakes and micro-targeted information
attacks compromise confidence in the integrity of information used to
build a common operating picture, then the operational difficulties
could also erode political trust between Allies in a few key ways. In
the North Atlantic Council, disagreement about the integrity of
information could slow the decision-making body's ability to react to
fast-changing operational realities.84 Further, compromised AI systems
may not only make it harder for forces to prevent harm to
non-combatants, but also to prevent friendly fire. In this way,
coalition forces arguably face even higher obligations to coordinate on
the reliability of their systems, relative to adversaries and near-peer
competitors that tend to operate alone. As such, responsible AI
governance is not purely technical; policy alignment and strategic
planning are likewise necessary to draw attention to risk management
above the tactical level. Even without being attacked, governability of
AI in a NATO context also means understanding how AI-enabled and
autonomous systems developed by the 30 Allies---and other
partners---will interact with one another. NATO has expressed interest
in governability as a principle of AI "to disengage or deactivate in
case of unintended behavior,"85 which echoes the U.S. Department of
Defense definition of governable AI.86 Disengaging adversaries is
important to maintain de-escalation measures in conflict. For NATO,
interoperability between systems also relates to governable AI because
allies must also consider how the interactions between the 30 Allies'
own AI-enabled and autonomous systems may result in unintended or
emergent behavior.87 This means that NATO has a responsibility to
coordinate activities---be they technical exchanges, standardization
efforts, or training and exercises---to build confidence that the
systems perform as humans intend.88 Without this coordination, the lack
of interoperability of allied systems could lead to accidents, and
separately, the potential loss of operational effectiveness also
presents vulnerabilities for adversaries to exploit. In addition to
governability, NATO and its Allies are assessing the risks that bias,
attacks, and lack of interpretability can introduce in relation to the
anticipated uses of a given AI system.89 In security and defense, new
and heightened risks include poisoning of the information environment,
deception systems and techniques, uncertainty about the performance of
systems in new and unknown environments, and the possibility that
tensions or accidents escalate at a faster tempo than humans and
institutions can process, among others. These risks can manifest either
in motivated attacks or unintentional failure modes.90 In both cases,
assuring and certifying that military assets are safe and secure is
important given the inherently high risk in operational environments.
These operational environments include the presumption that an adversary
is disrupting one's own systems, be it by directly attacking the AI
systems themselves, or disrupting the broader command, control, and
communications systems under which the AI systems are operating.91
Mitigating these types of risks is typically done in testing,
evaluation, validation and verification (TEVV) and in experimentation
activities.92 Yet AI cannot be validated and verified the way
traditional software systems are because there is no guarantee that an
AI system will perform in the real world as it does in a testing
environment, and because lifelong-learning systems will perform
differently over their lifecycle. Having robust assurance and TEVV
processes in place are also important for operators to build trust in
the systems they are meant to use, as well as for citizenries and
coalition partners at large to see that accountability procedures still
apply. As such, building institutional procedures to govern AI safety
and security is necessary to build trust in the use of the
technology---as well as to develop countermeasures and defensive systems
that protect against adversarial threats. NATO thus has an institutional
responsibility to prevent and mitigate these intentional and
unintentional failures if using AI in operations and mission support.93
As Table 69.1 shows, the Alliance also has a range of relevant entities
to coordinate national approaches to AI safety and security, as well as
facilitate safety measures as part of responsible use in the
Alliance-wide ecosystem. **[NATO has an important role to play in
military standardization and Allied policy planning for safe, secure,
and interoperable AI. This includes the coordinating role of the
Conference of National Armaments Directors and the Command, Control and
Consultation Board to implement complementary acquisition processes that
fuse AI adoption measures with safety responsibilities.
F]{.underline}**urthermore, entities including STO and NSO have a
**[significant role setting the technical baseline and promulgating
materiel standards that provide the technical framework for safety and
security.]{.underline}** Although their staffs are themselves small,
they both convene hundreds, if not thousands, of subject matter experts
in working groups. As such they both offer unique technical networks to
help shape safety and security in a way that minimize risk in
operations. **[NATO's resources and leadership are vital to using
standards and coalition policy to instill safe and secure technological
development, a necessary condition to interoperable and successful
future operations.]{.underline}**

Conclusion At the core, this chapter argues that **[NATO is well
positioned to steward the development of military AI and institute
governance mechanisms towards coalition inclusion of responsible AI
while simultaneously maintaining incentives for comparative
advantage.]{.underline}** Using the three pillars---**[ethics and
values, legal norms, and safety and security---as issue areas which
present AI governance challenges, we show that NATO has space to emerge
as a leader in AI governance and contribute to responsible adoption of
EDTs in the international security environment.]{.underline}** This
builds on foundations that derive NATO's responsibilities to govern AI
according to its values, legal obligations, and institutional interests.
These foundations from both STS and military innovation studies offer
ways that the Alliance can activate its existing governance mechanisms
to exert influence in new ways. Not only is this influence important for
the Alliance to bolster its institutional relevance in an evolving
international security architecture, but it also dovetails with its
capacity to shore up military effectiveness and interoperability as
Allies modernize their arsenals and associated concepts into the
frontier of AI. Importantly, we do not argue NATO is the only---or even
the most important---actor shaping AI governance in international
security. Other contributors in this Handbook impressively detail
efforts at both state and regional levels. Our aim has been to convince
sceptics that **[NATO has a role that is not replicated by other
stakeholders in the international security environment. NATO has
particular influence, procedures, and the competency to institute
certain governance mechanisms---namely standardization and policy
planning---that it can build on without needing to expend time building
new institutions from scratch.]{.underline}** Beyond just a role,
**[NATO is incentivized to emerge as a steward of AI governance and use
these mechanisms for future operations, should the Alliance wish to
maintain its unique position as a leader encouraging policy alignment,
defense planning, and military standardization.]{.underline}** More
broadly, this chapter illustrates that regional and international
organizations have high stakes for military AI governance. As
development, procurement, and implementation of AI is accelerating, it
is imperative that international organizations facilitate cooperation
among states and industry partners to guide responsible military AI
implementation aligned with core values and legal obligations. The
convening and coordinating power of international organizations, among
other governance tools, is a necessary step for state cooperation and
policy alignment. How exactly NATO interacts with other international
organizations in the security architecture, including the UN and EU, is
a political topic that will also have important implications for the
composition of international technology governance regimes, and is a
subject for further research. On that note NATO, or any other
international organization, is not exempt from these political hurdles.
As EDTs increasingly become a focal point in the geopolitical space, any
approach of AI governance in the international security environment will
have global political undertones. This will undoubtedly be a significant
hurdle for NATO as it balances responsible AI development and Allied
coordination and cooperation in a changing geopolitical landscape. And
certainly, the political realities may well represent the greatest
challenge and disincentivize NATO to emerge as a leader in responsible
military AI. Nevertheless, **[the three pillars indicate that NATO is an
institution with considerable opportunity to shape responsible AI
governance. More specifically, this entails urging and facilitating
Allied standards and policies to establish foundations for emerging
military technology built on informed and ethical principles and enhance
the international security environment.]{.underline}** In any discussion
of AI as an emerging military technology, it is necessary to strike a
balance between acknowledging the transformative potential of AI in the
security environment, while simultaneously recognizing the "hype" that
may, thus far, be unfounded. But some conclusions are clear. The risks
and opportunities of military AI can pose significant challenges for
future military operations, and this necessarily means there are many
stakeholders with a vested interest in developing, promoting, and
implementing responsible military AI. As multinational coalitions and
military operations are a foundational security policy for much of the
world, this means NATO is also a stakeholder with a vital interest in
promoting safe and secure technology among its partners, both
traditional and non-traditional. As the international security
environment continues to shift, there is space for NATO to pursue its
agenda to maintain technological superiority not just to protect and
defend its way of life, but also to build on its pillars of AI
governance to steward military innovation on a responsible trajectory.
