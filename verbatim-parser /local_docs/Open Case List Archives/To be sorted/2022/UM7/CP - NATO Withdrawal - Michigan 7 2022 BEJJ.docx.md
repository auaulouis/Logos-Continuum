# Russia Cooperation CP -- BEJJ

This CP has two versions, one that functions to fiat in offense, the
other to pair with NATO Bad.

The basic version argues that security cooperation is the necessary and
core foundation for all NATO operations and that ending security
cooperation with NATO would break the alliance (while being incompatible
with the plan). The goal is to let the neg force a NATO good/bad debate
against affirmatives that' have explicitly said they solve NATO
cohesion/NATO good impacts, and/or to provide uniqueness for NATO bad
impact turns.

The second version includes a negotiation with Russia, including ending
American security cooperation with NATO\-\--the goal being to give the
Neg a Russia Relations DA, with the CP generating Uniqueness. The
security cooperation freeze helps with 'Russia says yes' and also
answering perm do both (sends mixed signals, doesn't appear genuine,
etc.).

Cooperation,\"
https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/the-hard-power-of-security-cooperation/\]

[America's **strategic leaders**]{.underline} are quick to [use the
phrase "**allies** and **partners**" in today's dynamic **global
security environment**. They describe it as a]{.underline} unique
American advantage, the nation's most significant [strategic asset, and
the core of strategic competition and integrated deterrence.
Sometimes]{.underline}, though, [it is difficult [to understand
how]{.mark} such [**soft-power concepts** translate into]{.mark}
**actual [hard-power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With all eyes today focused
on the strength of European partnerships, air-force activity over
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s eastern flank [[provides a powerful
example]{.mark} of this concept. It is the result of a **firm
foundation** [constructed through **intentional**]{.mark} long-term
**relationship-building** and **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
activities]{.underline}.

[International relationship-building among allies]{.underline} and
partners is more than a soft-power activity. Yes, [[these
activities]{.mark} build **collegiality**, **credibility**, and
**trust**. But they also **[facilitate]{.mark}** the hard power of
**combat [effectiveness]{.mark}** by [fostering
**interoperability**]{.mark}, building a portfolio of
**[complementary]{.mark} weapons [systems]{.mark}**, and **demonstrating
success** in **combined operations** [through **training** and
**exercises**]{.mark}. International activity]{.underline} that
thoughtfully and intentionally develops, [equips, educates, trains,
exercises, [and]{.mark} integrates forces [ultimately]{.mark} provides
[the]{.mark} **fertile [ground]{.mark}** [that **knits together
allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} and partners who are able [to **reliably**
and **effectively operate** together. Doing so facilitates **deterrent**
and **operational** objectives.]{.underline} The allied air-force
response to Russian aggression in Ukraine has powerfully demonstrated
these important truths.

Allied Air Response to Russian Aggression

On March 10, 2022, Gen. Jeff Harrigian, commander of NATO Allied Air
Command and United States Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa,
hosted the NATO Air Chiefs' Symposium in Germany. This was not a meeting
called in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, it is a
regular and established meeting held semi-annually for over 40 years
that happened to fall at a particularly meaningful time for NATO and the
pending rollout of two major U.S. strategy documents. The symposium
brought together air chiefs or their national senior representatives
from 31 countries, most of them in person. While the collegial
atmosphere of friendly partnerships in the room at Ramstein Air Base was
evident to all of us who were involved, the meeting was characterized by
the potency of hard-power that had been fostered by those long-standing
relationships. It was a meaningful manifestation of soft-power
translated into combat effectiveness, cemented by a common cause, and
punctuated by a poignant video teleconference with Lt. Gen. Mykola
Oleschuk, the commander of the Ukrainian air force.

The rapid ability of NATO's Allied Air Command to establish defense and
deterrence as the result of the Russian aggression in Ukraine has been
staggering. All along NATO's eastern flank, advanced aircraft perform
around-the-clock air policing, homeland defense, and enhanced vigilance.
The air tasking order includes a slew of combat capabilities carefully
woven together. For the last four weeks, these forces have collectively
demonstrated stunning flexibility, integration, responsiveness, and
effectiveness in ways that strategic competitors could only dream of. It
has been allies and partners in action at a critical moment. None of
this happened by accident, and it didn't come out of nowhere. [American
senior leaders and **[security cooperation]{.mark}** professionals have
**[deliberately developed]{.mark}** strong [relationships]{.mark} with
allies]{.underline} and partners over time, [thereby providing a **solid
foundation** for **integrated deterrence** and **strategic
competition**]{.underline}. While these efforts have been largely
effective, some security cooperation policies and processes continue to
hinder successes.

Air and Space Interoperability

For years, senior leaders and [security cooperation professionals have
carefully crafted **strong relationships**, **superb interoperability**,
and **shared capabilities**]{.underline}. These efforts have created a
large fleet of common fighter aircraft --- like F-16s, F-18s, and F-35s
--- that seamlessly patrol the skies over NATO allies alongside their
Gripen, Rafale, Typhoon, and even MiG counterparts. These fighter
aircraft also fly alongside American bombers as a part of bomber task
forces. MQ-9s gather imagery and data alongside NATO RQ-4s. E-3s and
E-7s from multiple nations provide shared surveillance and
command-and-control while C-130s, A400s, and C-17s execute airlift.
KC-135 aircrew establish refueling tracks alongside their A330 partners.
Nonetheless, security cooperation activities that equip ally and partner
air forces are only part of this success.

[Close **collaboration** fosters **trust** and **understanding** that is
[**essential** to **enduring**]{.mark} and **effective**
[partners]{.mark}hips]{.underline}. These air chiefs grew up together.
They were educated together. They have researched, developed, tested,
and evaluated capabilities together. They have created tactics together,
deployed together, and fought together. [[They]{.mark}
regularly]{.underline} engage with one another, and --- [recognizing the
value of these interactions]{.underline} --- [[insist]{.mark} that
[members]{.mark} of their]{.underline} air [forces [do]{.mark} the same
through [**combined exercises**, **training**, and
**exchanges**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, these air chiefs have
created integrated command-and-control structures, interwoven networks,
established common data links, operationalized a mission partner
environment, and shared intelligence. Finally, they have enjoyed
consistency through the long-term benefits of the State Partnership
Program, and have employed a wide range of security cooperation tools to
meet their common objectives. Today, their bonds of trust are fortified
by a shared threat and their unified response to it.

This manifestation of hard-power is not only related to the skies. Many
of these air chiefs control large portions of their national space
capabilities while some are dual-hatted as space chiefs. Collectively,
they enjoy shared space situational awareness and other space-based data
agreements; collaborative launch and payloads; and complementary
satellite communication, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. Recognizing the challenges of a contested space
environment that is a warfighting domain, they understand the urgency of
space control. They also realize they are interwoven into joint forces
that span all domains and are part of whole-of-government strategies. It
is hard-power on display.

Soft Power Translated to Combat Effectiveness

While the hard-power example of allied air and space force activity on
NATO's eastern flank during the last month has been striking, the
principles are generalizable and translatable to other theaters and
other situations. For decades, [American]{.underline} senior leaders and
[**[security cooperation]{.mark}** professionals have carefully crafted
**strong [relationships]{.mark}** among **allies**]{.underline} and
partners around the world that [[provide the **necessary foundation**
for]{.mark} a strategy of **[integrated
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in an environment of strategic
competition. [They have created common or **[interoperable
fleets]{.mark}**]{.underline} of aircraft that can fly together and
fight together. [These **weapons systems** are operated through
**integrated** **[c]{.mark}**ommand-[**and**-**c**]{.mark}ontrol systems
[and]{.mark} with **[shared data-link]{.mark}** architectures. Their
**effectiveness** has been shaped through **common education**, refined
through **combined training**, and proven through **robust
exercises**]{.underline}. Ally and partner relationships are not simply
a flaccid display of soft power, nor are they a federalized force that
operates separately in the same general areas of responsibility. They
are actually an operationally effective, integrated force. Yet, some
security cooperation processes continue to hinder progress and harm
effectiveness.

Barriers to Further Progress

There is still much work to be done to overcome security cooperation
obstacles and properly create a force that is fully ready for strategic
competition and ideally postured for integrated deterrence. First,
[[onerous]{.mark} **security [barriers hinder progress]{.mark}** in
**interoperability** and **integration**]{.underline}, creating
operational risk to avoid minor technical risk. When making
exportability rulings, decision-makers too heavily and strictly consider
security risk or concerns about technological exploitation, preventing
the export of U.S. weapons systems without a proper consideration for
the operational necessity of offering that capability to allies and
partners in order to share burdens and develop interoperability. As a
result, in the name of maintaining a unilateral technological advantage,
bureaucrats pass on operational risk to combatant commanders and
warfighters who expect to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with fully-capable
allies and partners. Second, exportability of combat-relevant systems
remains an afterthought of the acquisition process. Though American
policy directs that new systems be designed for exportability, waivers
to this policy are liberally applied and commonplace. Finally, [[slow
**security cooperation** processes often]{.mark} deliver certain systems
**late-to-need**, in part because of **plodding** security-focused
**decision-making mechanisms** that are a part of exportability
rulings]{.underline}. Delayed delivery schedules create a competitive
disadvantage as compared to strategic rivals [[while
**frustrating**]{.mark} **the [allies]{.mark}** and
**partners**]{.underline} that the United States will rely upon in the
next conflict. In the end, some [Defense Department and interagency
policies]{.underline} and processes continue [to **zealously guard**
capabilities]{.underline} while **[[hinder]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
[[**interoperability** and]{.underline}]{.mark} harming operational
**[[effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. American leaders and security
cooperation professionals need to systematically eliminate these
remaining obstacles to properly meet integrated deterrence objectives.

### CP\-\--Russia\-\--1NC

#### Text: The United States federal government should negotiate a grand bargain with the Russian Federation, including committing to cease U.S. participation in NATO initiatives. 

#### Negotiating a [grand bargain]{.underline} is the [only path]{.underline} to a [sustainable]{.underline} European security theater\-\--it [spills over]{.underline} to concessions on [arms control]{.underline}, [Ukraine]{.underline}, AND Russian withdrawal from [breakaway regions]{.underline}. 

**McFaul '22** \[Michael; February 11; Professor of Political Science,
Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University;
Foreign Affairs, "How to Make a Deal with Putin,"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2022-02-11/how-make-deal-putin>\]

If Putin does agree to negotiate, then [Biden]{.underline} and his team
[should **not** just offer defensively **minimal concessions** to freeze
the crisis]{.underline}. Instead, in concert with allies and partners,
[[Biden should **seize the**]{.mark} **diplomatic [offensive]{.mark}**
[and counter with a]{.mark} **comprehensive**, **[grand
bargain]{.mark}** for enhancing European security]{.underline}. Call it
"Helsinki 2.0." [[This]{.mark} agreement [could]{.mark} refresh and
**[modernize]{.mark}** the **[Helsinki]{.mark} Accords** signed during
the Cold War, [which **stabilized** the
**continent**]{.mark}]{.underline} even as U.S.-Soviet competition grew
in other parts of the world. [[It]{.mark} could **[resuscitate]{.mark}**
and amend defunct **[arms control]{.mark}** agreements [and provide
a]{.mark} **bigger [framework]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} European security,
and in the process help solve]{.underline} the issues surrounding
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Convening a major summit to renegotiate European security will give
Russia an international platform that Putin does not deserve. But that
symbolism shouldn't stop Biden, NATO leaders, and other European
democracies. The Helsinki Accords recognized the Soviet Union as a
superpower, and that affirmation helped persuade Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev to make concessions. [Putin also likes **attention**, and the
West should be prepared to offer **cheap pageantry**]{.underline} not
only to prevent a new Russian invasion into Ukraine but also [to repair
Europe's broken security architecture. The **U**nited **S**tates and
Europe must have the courage to move **beyond** defensive **patchwork
fixes** and instead pivot to **bold**, **aggressive initiatives** to
make the continent safer]{.underline}.

Bit by Bit

[[On]{.mark} the **[surface]{.mark}**, the [**1970s** were not]{.mark}
an [auspicious]{.mark} time for Soviet-U.S. compromise]{.underline}.
Many observers believed the Kremlin's power was rising and Washington's
was falling. Communists were taking power in parts of southeast Asia and
southern Africa. Tension between the world's main blocs was running
high.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} in the middle of the decade, Canadian,
Soviet, [U.S., and European [diplomats **set aside**]{.mark} their broad
and fundamental **[disagreements]{.mark}** to discuss an issue of
**shared concern**: European security]{.underline}. After several years
of negotiations, they produced and signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act,
which codified ambiguous issues left over from World War II. At the
heart of the accords was a central compromise: Western states de facto
recognized the borders that resulted from Soviet conquests after World
War II, and in return, the Soviet Union agreed to "respect human rights
and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience,
religion or beliefs, for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion, and joined the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) tasked with implementing these obligations.
The Soviet Union and the West also tacitly agreed to disagree on the
precise definitions of government accountability, human rights, economic
rights, and non-intervention in internal affairs. Ambiguity, they
showed, is sometimes necessary for effective diplomacy. 

In the first two decades after the accords were signed, [[Europe
saw]{.mark} an **explosion** of [new]{.mark} **security
[agreements]{.mark}** and **treaties**]{.underline}, particularly after
Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. In 1987, he joined U.S.
President Ronald Reagan to sign [[the **I**]{.mark}ntermediate-Range
**[N]{.mark}**uclear **[F]{.mark}**orces]{.underline} (INF)
[Treaty]{.underline}, eliminating a whole class of highly destabilizing
weapons. In 1990, [[the **C**]{.mark}onventional **[A]{.mark}**rmed
**[F]{.mark}**orces in **[E]{.mark}**urope]{.underline} (CFE)
[Treaty]{.underline} came online, substantially reducing the size of
conventional forces deployed on the continent. [The 1990
**[Vienna]{.mark} Document**]{.underline}, signed by Canada, the Soviet
Union, the United States, and most of Europe and Central Asia, expanded
transparency about weapons and military training exercises.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia and the West continued to make
deals that helped keep Europe secure. The 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which
followed the Vienna Document, allowed signatories to fly reconnaissance
missions through one another's territories to collect information on
military activities. [The ambitious 1990 **Charter of
[Paris]{.mark}**]{.underline} trumpeted that all European signatories
would "build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of
government of our nations." It declared prematurely that "the era of
confrontation and division of Europe has ended." [The 1994
**[Budapest]{.mark} Memorandum**]{.underline} on Security Assurances for
Ukraine sent Kyiv's nuclear weapons to Russia in exchange for promises
that Moscow, the United Kingdom, and the United States would respect
Ukraine's territorial integrity. [The 1997 **N**ATO-**R**ussia
**F**ounding **A**ct]{.underline} established mechanisms for the two
parties to collaborate, marking a high point in cooperation.

But during the following decade, ties between the two sides
deteriorated. [Putin](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2020-06-09/pinning-down-putin#author-info) came
to power in 2000, and he grew progressively more disappointed with the
West as NATO further expanded in 2004; as Washington started a war in
Iraq; and after the so-called color revolutions in Georgia in 2003 and
Ukraine in 2004. The West, meanwhile, grew disenchanted with Moscow
after Russia launched the
second [Chechen](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2000-03-01/russias-ruinous-chechen-war) war;
grew more autocratic; invaded Georgia and recognized Abkhazia and South
Ossetia as independent countries in 2008; annexed Crimea in 2014; and
then supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, leading to ongoing war
and thousands of deaths.

European security agreements from the previous two decades began to
break down. Russia stopped implementing the CFE Treaty in 2007. Putin
then violated virtually every European and international security
agreement his Kremlin predecessors signed. The United States stopped
meeting its CFE obligations in 2011, and under former President Donald
Trump, pulled out of the INF and Open Skies treaties, as well. The
Vienna Documents today do little to enhance transparency, and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)---the
successor to the CSCE---has become feckless in large measure because
Moscow objects to its efforts to
monitor [elections](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2018-03-16/putins-past-explains-russias-future) and
protect human rights.

Getting to Yes

After decades of division, it will be difficult---and maybe
impossible---for Russia and the West to strike any security deals on
Europe. They have little faith in each other and plenty of reasons for
suspicion. But given the stakes, the world
must [try](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2021-06-14/how-biden-should-deal-putin).
[If Putin signals a **commitment** to **negotiate**, Biden and his
European partners should **go big**. After all, Europe's security
architecture needs **genuine repair** and **creative
renewal**]{.underline}.

[They should [**start** with]{.mark}]{.underline} steps toward
[revamping **[transparency]{.mark}**, which will allow each country to
keep tabs on the other's activities]{.underline} and better predict each
other's actions. Right now, Russia, the United States, and Europe have
less information about the deployment of rival soldiers and weapons than
at any time since the end of the Cold War. [[A]{.mark} new **grand
[bargain]{.mark}** on European security could [commit]{.mark} **all
[signatories]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} more **frequent [monitor]{.mark}ing**
of troop deployments, [weapons]{.mark} deployments, and military
exercises. [The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
**Russia**]{.mark} have **[learned]{.mark}** how to **successfully
implement** an obtrusive inspections regime [from]{.mark} the **[New
START]{.mark} Treaty**]{.underline}, which limits the number of nuclear
warheads and delivery vehicles each country can deploy. New START is one
of the few U.S.-Russian deals that still operates, and a broader
agreement could share the treaty's obligations to short-notice
inspections and close probing of weapon systems. [Helsinki 2.0 could
allow Russian inspectors to visit]{.underline} the sites of U.S.
[missile defenses in Poland and Romania, and NATO monitors]{.underline}
could have similar access to Russia's Iskander missiles in
[Kaliningrad]{.underline}.

[Moscow and [Washington could]{.mark} further **bolster transparency**
by rejoining, amending, and **[moderniz]{.mark}ing** previously
**effective [agreements]{.mark}**[, such as]{.mark} the **[Open
Skies]{.mark} Treaty** [and]{.mark} **CFE**]{.underline}. To avoid
dangerous miscalculations, both states must also work to revive the
Vienna Documents. That means Russia and every NATO country should offer
specified notifications about training and impose new limits on the
scale and locations of exercises, especially because exercise
preparations can appear very similar to planning for an actual attack.

Diplomats should also dust off, modernize, and implement old ideas that
never came to fruition. Russia and the United States failed to implement
a 2000 memorandum of agreement on [sharing data about missile
launches]{.underline}, known as the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC),
because of technicalities and mounting hostilities in U.S.-Russian
relations. But an initiative of its kind between Moscow and NATO or
among all OSCE members [would enhance all of **Europe's
security**]{.underline} (including Russia's) [and could have **better
odds** of **[succeed]{.mark}**ing]{.underline}.

Transparency, of course, is just one aspect of arms control. After
Russia and the West agree to open their systems for inspections,
diplomats will need to turn to the issue of control itself. They should
begin by addressing the most destabilizing forces: the troops and
weapons stationed on or near the Russian border. [[On a
**reciprocal**]{.mark} and **verifiable [basis]{.mark}**[, all sides
should **pull**]{.mark} **these [back]{.mark}**, beginning with the
massive Russian army mobilized around Ukraine today]{.underline}. They
should also pull back their rockets. [[This may **seem** like a **hard
ask**]{.mark} of Moscow, [but Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} has already
proposed that signatories not deploy land-based intermediate- and
short-range missiles in areas where they can reach other signatories.
Russian commentary [has [**emphasized** keeping]{.mark} all such
[weapons out]{.mark} of Ukraine. [Their demand is **reasonable**]{.mark}
as long as Moscow places **similar restraints**]{.underline} on
short-range rockets that can hit Kyiv, Riga, Tallinn, Vilnius, or
Warsaw.

The Biden Administration could also propose some limits on missile
defenses in Europe. [[Washington]{.mark} could **agree to
[refrain]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} deploying **[defense systems]{.mark}**
on the continent with capabilities [against]{.mark} Russian
**[i]{.mark}**nter**[c]{.mark}**ontinental **[b]{.mark}**allistic
**[m]{.mark}**issile[**s** **in return** for limits on]{.mark} **Russian
missile [defenses]{.mark}** in the European theater]{.underline}. This
may sound like a big U.S. concession, but it's not. The U.S.
interceptors that are currently deployed (SM3s) have no capability
against Russian strategic weapons. The smartest place for interceptors
that can defend the U.S. homeland against Russian or North Korean
weapons (the Ground-Based Interceptor, or GBI) is Alaska, which is where
they are mostly already located.

To better safeguard the United States and Europe from quick, devastating
attacks, negotiators also must try to reduce the overall number of
missiles---especially nuclear missiles. [Ideally, both **Russia** and
the **U**nited **S**tates would **rejoin** and **credibly implement**
the **INF treaty**]{.underline}. To do so, Russia would have to agree to
include its 9M729 missile in the agreement. If a complete ban on
intermediate-range ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles in Europe
proves impossible, negotiators could at least prohibit these kinds of
rockets from being armed with nuclear warheads. Although this would be
difficult to verify, [negotiators should also try to **restrict** or
**ban** the deployment of **t**actical **n**uclear **w**eapon**s** in
Europe]{.underline} (including Russian territory west of the Ural
Mountains).

Diplomats also must attempt to reduce the amount of conventional
weaponry on the continent, going beyond either the original or adapted
CFE treaties. If new limits on conventional weapons prove impossible,
negotiators could consider more modest regional limits, such as in the
Baltic or Black Sea regions. [[They should]{.mark} try to **place
[limit]{.mark}s** in Europe on **cluster bombs** and
**[cyber]{.mark}weapons**, [which]{.mark} can [target]{.mark} civilians
and **[c]{.mark}**ritical **[i]{.mark}**nfrastructure]{.underline}.

Finally, [Western diplomats must **insist** again that Putin **obtain
permission** before placing troops in **other countries**, which would
keep Russia **in line** with agreements signed by its previous leaders.
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} will dispute who the legitimate host nation
is in Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. But he [[might be
**persuaded** to relinquish]{.mark} **Russian [claims]{.mark}** of
consent [in]{.mark} certain **[breakaway regions]{.mark}**, such as
Transnistria in Moldova and Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine]{.underline},
if in return, NATO allies could drop a demand from the CFE treaty that
placed constraints on Russian troop movements between different
regions---or "flanks"---of Russia. (Of course, this new provision would
not mean greenlighting buildups on the borders of other countries.) Such
a deal is unlikely, but Western diplomats must affirm the principle of
host nation consent.

#### US-Russian cooperation solves extinction.

and Columbia University; \"Why Russia and America Need Each Other,\"

\"The main message I have today is that [we need to **awaken to the
importance** of the relationship between Russia and the United
States;]{.underline} [we should not leave it on **auto-pilot
indefinitely,\"**]{.underline} [said Dmitri Trenin, senior associate and
deputy director, Carnegie Moscow Center]{.underline}, at a 2 February
2007 seminar at the Kennan Institute. Trenin recounted the current
problems in the relationship, arguing that both sides have unrealistic
expectations of one another. In his view, [[the]{.mark} U.S.-Russian
[relationship is]{.mark} of [**crucial
importance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and he described ways in which
relations could be improved.

\"At the beginning of this year, the talk in both capitals is rather
downbeat,\" Trenin said, adding, \"I think people agree more or less
that we have never had a relationship that was at such a low level as
today since 1991.\" Trenin said that this is true in spite of what he
sees as a great deal of shared interests between the two countries.

[According to Trenin, the **deterioration** of U.S.-Russian relations is
viewed in **starkly different terms** in Washington and in
Moscow.]{.underline} \"If you put your ear to the ground in Washington,
it\'s all because of Putin\'s authoritarianism at home, and increasing
assertiveness abroad,\" Trenin said. He added that Washington views
Russia\'s increased strength as a direct result of its large exports of
oil and natural gas, and for this reason Russia\'s resurgence is seen as
both undeserved and fragile.

\"If you listen in Moscow, you get a very different story,\" Trenin
observed. Prevailing opinion in Moscow regards the heightened tension
between the United States and Russia as a natural consequence of
Russia\'s increased strength. Russia\'s leadership believes that
tensions inevitably arise when one power gains strength rapidly while
another country\'s power diminishes, Trenin stated.

Both of these views are wrong, Trenin believes. \"Despite what some
people in Russia hope, the United States is not a declining power, Iraq
notwithstanding,\" he stated. \"As the world\'s most important nation,
it will be around for a long time.\" [On the other hand, he continued,
Russia is **more important** than most Americans realize. \"[Despite
what]{.mark} a number of [people]{.mark} in the U.S. have [concluded,
Russia **is not**]{.mark} **so much [in decline]{.mark}**[; it
is]{.mark} rather in the process of **[reformatting]{.mark} itself**,
emerging [as a **totally different economy**]{.mark} and **a totally
different society** than the Soviet one,\"]{.underline} Trenin said.

The steady deterioration of relations is threatening to jeopardize
future Russian-American partnership and cooperation, Trenin warned:
\"The U.S. and Russia may be straying into the territory of direct
material damage to their existing interests.\" He noted that this
situation is not likely to change until the respective American and
Russian presidential elections in 2008. [Both of the new presidents will
probably be untested statesmen, and thus an opportunity for
**reinventing the relationship** will arise.]{.underline}

In spite of these disagreements, Trenin emphasized that [Russia and the
United States **need one another** and that cooperation between the two
countries is **essential**.]{.underline} [[On]{.mark} a **wide range of
[issues]{.mark},**]{.underline} [U.S. and Russian [interests coincide,
including **non-prolif**]{.mark}**eration** [of w]{.mark}eapons of
**[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction**]{.underline},
**[[managing]{.mark} the rise of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
[dealing with the]{.underline}]{.mark} [difficult situation in the
[Middle East]{.mark}, and [resolving]{.mark} \"frozen
conflicts.\"]{.underline} In addition, [[Russia]{.mark} needs American

In connection with this, Trenin believes that [a new global institution
needs to be formed to **maintain stability and security**.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} organization would be similar to the G-8, in that it
[would provide a forum for the discussion of major problems confronting
the world,]{.underline} he said, but would be more inclusive than the
G-8, because it would not require a country to be \"democratic.\" The
group could include all the G-8 members, as well as China, India, and
Brazil. Russia wants to be given a seat at the table where decisions are
made, Trenin stressed, and such an organization could be one way to
accomplish this goal.

Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, senior
director of Guard Hill House; \"American security cooperation needs an
'integrity check',\"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/american-security-cooperation-needs-an-integrity-check/\]

[Yet successful **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline}---which includes arms transfers,
training, security assistance, treaties, or agreements---[[is built
around]{.mark} two key principles: [**trust** and]{.mark} **integrity of
[commitment]{.mark}**[, both]{.mark} of which are [**at risk**
today]{.mark} thanks to]{.underline} the haphazard US [withdrawal from
Afghanistan]{.underline}.

In the US military, [the term "integrity check" refers to]{.underline} a
[concern about]{.underline} an individual's or unit's [**capability** or
**trustworthiness**]{.underline}. Following the debacle in Kabul, the
United States and its global security cooperation posture is in dire
need of one.

[Just [look at]{.mark} the **[anger]{.mark}** expressed [by]{.mark}
stalwart **[NATO]{.mark}** allies such as the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom, which in the
aftermath of 9/11 unquestionably joined in to invoke the Washington
Treaty's Article 5 for collective self-defense (the first time the
Alliance ever did so). That NATO launched its first operations outside
the Euro-Atlantic area and began a far-reaching transformation of
capabilities signaled its trust in the United States' reliability when
it came to security cooperation.

Now, [treaty **[allies]{.mark}** and **partner** nations [are
**reassessing**]{.mark} their bilateral **security
[relationships]{.mark}** [with the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
It's not just the NATO states caught off-guard by the haphazard
departure from Afghanistan that will think twice before embarking upon
future military campaigns with the United States. Resolute defense
partners in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific---including Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan---likely also need
overt reassurance, such as a clear national-security strategy and
declared recommitments.

Additionally, these partners are increasingly feeling the need to
proactively raise their own defense capabilities by boosting their
budgets or coordinating with allies to ensure regional security along
with the United States.

Besides stress-testing the integrity of American security cooperation,
the Afghanistan withdrawal also highlights the necessity of staying the
course on long-term investment in mutually beneficial security
partnerships with countries with which the United States has shared
interests---or shared threats. [[Well before]{.underline}]{.mark} the
fall of [**[Afghanistan]{.mark}**, foreign [partners were]{.mark}
already **[questioning]{.mark} the [reliability]{.mark}** of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates at a
time when the debate in Washington about our global posture was becoming
increasingly politicized.

[[The case for partnering]{.mark} with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[needs to be]{.mark}
**clearly [articulated]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} the
**[presence]{.mark}**, **performance**, [and **processes** of]{.mark}
American **[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline}. The
quality of US aerospace and defense equipment, the commitment to build
capabilities, and the reassurance that comes from partnering with the US
military must include further transparency, accountability, and
predictability of policies.

[[If not]{.underline}]{.mark}, American [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}
and partners [[will be **hesitant**]{.mark} **to collaborate** with us
on future **shared security** requirements---[or]{.mark} simply **[seek
cooperation elsewhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Lack of US investment [crushes]{.underline} NATO -- exposes [deficiencies]{.underline} and [drastically weakens]{.underline} NATO

**Bergmann & Cicarelli '21** \[Max, Siena; 1-13-2021; \"NATO's Financing
Gap,\" Center for American Progress,
<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/>, smarx,
AZM\]

[The **U**nited **S**tates as NATO's financial backbone]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[operated on the **assumption**
that]{.underline}]{.mark} its most powerful member, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [would play the same
role]{.mark} it had during the first two world wars]{.underline}.

In the years [after WWII, the United States pushed to rebuild Europe,
both [economically]{.mark} and militarily]{.underline}. While the
Marshall Plan provided critical economic assistance, [the United
States]{.underline} also effectively [financed the military
reconstruction of Western Europe]{.underline}. Through the 1949 Mutual
Defense Assistance Act and the 1951 Mutual Security Act, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [provided]{.mark}]{.underline}
more than **[\$[50 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in today's dollars in
military aid]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the newly formed
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.13

When [NATO]{.underline} was formed, it [was seen as a way of keeping
Americans engaged in Europe and preventing the **U**nited **S**tates
from reverting to]{.underline} a post-WWI
**[isolationism]{.underline}**. [But [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [was]{.mark} also [focused on]{.mark} encouraging
European rearmament]{.underline} and reducing reliance on the United
States, [which led to **strong early U.S. [support]{.mark}** [for
European defense]{.mark}]{.underline} restructuring and
[integration]{.underline}. U.S. efforts to spur rearmament, particularly
in West Germany, were a crucial motivating factor for France to push for
European integration through the merging of the coal and steel
industries into the European Coal and Steel Community.14 The United
States also strongly backed a French proposal to create a European
Defense Community (EDC), which would have formed a pan-European army.15
In the aftermath of WWII, the United States therefore sought and
encouraged ways to spur European defense reforms in an effort to
strengthen the European pillar of the newly formed alliance, which would
have reduced Western Europe's military and economic reliance on the
United States. Ultimately, however, the [EDC never took
hold]{.underline} and a European Army was never formed. [[Europe
integrated **economically**]{.mark}, but **[not
militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Defense was left to nation-states, coordinated through NATO, [leaving
the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} not only [[as
the]{.mark} lead military guarantor of European defense but also as
**its de facto [financial backbone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As Western
Europe recovered economically, [individual]{.mark} NATO [members took
on]{.mark} responsibility for [financing]{.mark}]{.underline} and
sustaining investments in their military capabilities, [[which led
to]{.mark} U.S. [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Cold War
[[about]{.mark} **European [underinvestment]{.mark}** in
defense]{.underline}.16 However, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
military [presence]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline} and focus on the
Soviet Union meant that it [[**made up** for]{.mark}]{.underline}
whatever **[[European]{.mark} military
[deficiencies]{.mark}]{.underline}** may have existed.

After the Cold War, unlike after WWII, the United States and many NATO
members cut defense spending, taking the so-called peace dividend.
However, NATO simultaneously expanded eastward, incorporating numerous
Warsaw Pact countries. These former Warsaw Pact members had militaries
that had been designed and built with the purpose of operating with the
Soviet Union against the alliance. Additionally, and similar to NATO's
founding members after WWII, these nations lacked the financial
wherewithal to rebuild their militaries. Yet unlike after WWII, the
United States made no significant investment to rebuild and transform
the militaries of these new members states.

[[When NATO was called]{.mark} on [in Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}
after 9/11, [[it was the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[that]{.mark}]{.underline}, through coalition support funds, [[provided
funding]{.mark} and assistance [to encourage]{.mark}]{.underline},
support, and sustain member [state [operations]{.mark} in
Afghanistan]{.underline}.17 [[Following]{.mark} Russia's invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2014, [[the alliance recognized]{.mark}
the [need for **urgent investment** to deter
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Members pledged to spend more, and [the
United States established the European Reassurance
Initiative]{.underline}, now called the European Deterrence
Initiative.18

[The]{.underline} European Deterrence [Initiative provided **tens of
billions** of dollars to **bolster NATO's capacity** to deter
Russia]{.underline}. [It invested in modernizing and expanding military
facilities, provided training assistance to forces, and funded the
development of military capabilities]{.underline}.19 [This [**American**
effort]{.mark} has been significant in **[bolster]{.mark}ing [NATO's
overall strength]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once again, [it was an example
of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**stepping in financially to
fill a gap** in the alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

smarx, AZM\]

On paper, [[NATO]{.mark} has the potential to be viable]{.underline} as
a collective security organization [[without the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. Remove the United States from the
equation and [NATO [retains]{.mark} 27]{.underline} member [states with
nearly]{.underline} **[[600 million people]{.underline}]{.mark}**\[iii\]
and a combined nominal GDP of almost \$20 trillion.\[iv\] [This **should
be** more than adequate]{.underline} to build a self-sufficient military
infrastructure. A majority of NATO's members are also deeply connected
both politically and economically through the European Union.\[v\] [[In
the long term]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [[NATO]{.mark} without the United
States [may]{.mark}]{.underline} not only **[[be
feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but desirable.
**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [these]{.underline} rosy structural
[facts belie a **more troublingly reality**]{.underline} [in
NATO's]{.underline} immediate [future]{.underline}.

[When looking at]{.underline} NATO's **[[short-term]{.mark}
viability]{.underline}**, [the picture [**is far less positive**
without]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[**substantial commitment** of the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates.]{.underline} The [most
obvious]{.underline} item of [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} [if the US
were to]{.underline} leave or **[moderate its commitment]{.underline}**
to NATO in the short term [[would be]{.underline} **[sheer
manpower]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In 2016, [[the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} had a [combined [troop
s]{.mark}trength]{.underline} of around 3.1 million active duty
personnel. [[Without the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}[nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, that immediately **[[drops by]{.mark}
nearly [half]{.mark}]{.underline}** to somewhere below 1.9 million
personnel.\[vi\] [[This ignores]{.mark} thousands of pieces of
**[military equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that would **no longer
support NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including armored vehicles,
aircraft, and ships]{.underline}. Granted, Russia---the most prominent
threat to NATO---has significantly cut down its active duty forces in
recent years, estimated at just over 900,000 active duty personnel in
2016.\[vii\] However, the [exact number of reservists [Russia
has]{.mark}]{.underline} at its disposal is unknown, and [could be
anywhere from 2 to **[20 million personnel]{.mark}**]{.underline}
depending on the scale of a call up.\[viii\] [While NATO]{.underline}
forces [may have an advantage in training, equipment, and organization,
past a certain point]{.underline} **[[quantity surpasses
quality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Russia has]{.underline} also [been
increasing efforts to update its **military arsenal**]{.underline},
purchasing new weapons and equipment to close that gap as well.\[ix\]

The **[[more important question]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[may
be who would assume]{.mark} the burden of **[leadership]{.mark} for the
alliance**]{.underline} [in the absence of the **U**nited
**S**tates.]{.underline} Among the most influential of NATO's members,
[[there is **no**]{.mark} **obvious [candidate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[to take the lead if the **U**nited **S**tates were to step
aside]{.underline}, and [[all]{.mark} the obvious candidates [face their
own **significant political issues**]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
abroad. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[K]{.mark}**ingdom['s]{.mark}
[relationship]{.mark} with]{.underline} continental [Europe [has been
**strained**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
[[after]{.underline}]{.mark}math of [its vote to leave the
[EU]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its relationship will be further tested in the
months and years to come as that process plays out.\[x\] [[Germany's
President]{.underline}]{.mark}-elect, former Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, [has broken with Chancellor]{.underline} Angela
[Merkel's governing coalition with a more conciliatory tone towards
Russia]{.underline}. [He [has **criticized NATO**
policies]{.mark}]{.underline} on sanctions and military exercises.\[xi\]
Meanwhile, [France remains in a constant state of high alert following a
string of terrorist attacks]{.underline} over the past several years---a
threat it is not alone in facing---with new plots being uncovered and
thwarted in February and troops remaining deployed on the
streets.\[xii\]

[These]{.underline} existing [political issues are aggravated by the
fact that the [UK, Germany, and France]{.mark} all **[face populist or
nationalist surges]{.mark}** in their domestic politics]{.underline}, a
trend seen across Europe. [The UK Independence Party]{.underline} played
an instrumental role in Britain's decision to leave the EU. [National
Front]{.underline} candidate Marine Le Pen is highly likely to make it
to the second round of the French presidential election this year. [The
Alternative for Germany party]{.underline} of Frauke Petry and Jorg
Meuthen seems poised to gain its first seats in the Bundestag following
elections this fall. [Among a laundry list of controversial policy
positions, these [parties have]{.mark} tended to]{.underline} either
[have **highly [critical views of NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [close
[**ties to Russia**, or **both**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[xiii\] [While
the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is obviously not without its
own domestic political issues, the relative [size]{.mark}, power, [and
strength]{.mark} of its institutions all [put it in a **better
position** to]{.mark} simultaneously [deal with]{.mark} such [issues and
wrangle]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} at the same time]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} [**questionable** if Britain, France, or Germany would
be able to do the same]{.underline} if the mantle of leadership fell
upon them.

[[If the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [were to leave]{.mark}
NATO]{.underline} in the next four years, [[**even if** the alliance
were not to **collapse immediately**]{.mark},]{.underline} [[the
ensuring vacuum would]{.mark} call into [question]{.mark} its
**[short-term survivability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But even if
President Trump does not truly plan to leave NATO, the longer the doubt
over continued US participation, the greater damage this uncertainty
creates. It encourages political forces within member states not
consistent with NATO's values and it may encourage potential adversaries
to undertake provocative and aggressive actions. It is critical that
President Trump be more consistent and clear in voicing his desire to
remain in the alliance, and frame whatever criticisms he has of
NATO---which are not baseless---in the context of improving the
alliance. It is also critically important that the President strive to
set a better domestic political example for NATO allies as they face
increasing levels of political instability and uncertainty of their own.
More than his own approval ratings may be riding on his ability to be a
unifying political figure.

### Solvency\-\--Ext

Building off President Biden's participation in the 2021 Brussels
Summit, the United States is joining with our Allies to ensure NATO is
fit for purpose in an era of increased strategic competition. In Riga,
Foreign Ministers will discuss the development of [NATO's next Strategic
Concept]{.underline}, which will guide the Alliance as it addresses
current and emerging challenges. The new Strategic Concept will be
prepared for adoption at the NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain, June 29-30,
2022. At the Brussels Summit, NATO leaders endorsed the Comprehensive
Cyber Defense Policy to support the Alliance's overall deterrence and
defense posture. Putting that policy into practice, Allies are
developing a Cyber Action Plan to ensure NATO's resilience against
increasingly frequent and complex malicious cyber activity perpetrated
by state and non-state actors, including disruptive ransomware attacks
against critical infrastructure.

Recognizing the increasingly complex threats to our security, Allied
leaders affirmed in December 2019 and in June 2021 that [national and
collective resilience are essential for credible deterrence and defense,
and vital to safeguard our societies, citizens, and shared
values.]{.underline} Allied leaders issued a Strengthened Resilience
Commitment that outlined future priorities, including on the
[**security** of supply chains, critical infrastructure, and energy
networks]{.underline}, as well as preparedness for pandemics and natural
disasters. Allies have subsequently updated [NATO's]{.underline} seven
[**baseline requirements** to support the effective enablement of armed
forces]{.underline} and the Alliance's three core tasks of collective
defense, crisis management, and **[cooperative security.]{.underline}**

At the Brussels Summit, Allies endorsed a Climate Change and [Security
Action Plan positioning NATO as a leading international
organization]{.underline} for understanding and adapting to the impact
of climate change on security. NATO recognizes climate change as a
defining challenge of our times and a threat multiplier impacting Allied
security. NATO is incorporating climate change considerations into its
full spectrum of work, ranging from defense planning and capability
development to civil preparedness and exercises.

To maintain the Alliance's technological edge, Allies are negotiating
the provisional Charter of the Defense Innovation Accelerator for the
North Atlantic, [an initiative that will facilitate technological
cooperation and speed the adoption]{.underline} of technological
solutions to enhance the Alliance's defense and security.

In the 2019 Leaders' Statement and the 2021 Brussels Communique, NATO
Allies recognized the PRC's growing influence and international policies
can present challenges we need to address together as an Alliance.
Beijing is building up its military and expanding its footprint in
cyberspace, the Arctic, and in areas that directly affect Transatlantic
security, including the Middle East and Africa.

The progress Allies have made on defense spending helps ensure NATO is
ready and has the capabilities required to meet any challenge. European
Allies and Canada have increased their defense spending by more than
\$260 billion since 2014. These increases are significant, but
[Allies]{.underline} must also [continue to make investments to
meet]{.underline} their [NATO]{.underline} Capability
[Targets]{.underline}, [to increase]{.underline} the
[readiness]{.underline} of their armed forces, especially the NATO
Readiness Initiative, and [to meet force generation
commitments]{.underline} for NATO missions and operations.

<https://ecfr.eu/article/four-ways-europeans-can-help-refocus-nato/>
/alundy)

As the nature of global security shifts; as China rises; and with Joe
Biden in the White House, it is time for Europeans to consider how they
can best play their part in modernising NATO.

The first thing [Europeans]{.underline} can do is to [seek to retain
American support for the alliance by making clear they recognise, and
will respond to, today's shifting strategic priorities]{.underline}. We
are now back to a situation in which, from the United States'
standpoint, its alliance with Europe gives it a comparative advantage in
global power competition. But even the most Atlanticist US president
will ask Europe to sustain its part of a transatlantic bargain fit for
the present, not for the past. Since America's priorities are domestic
renewal and competition with China, such a bargain has the following
contours: [NATO]{.underline}, with American support, [will focus mainly
on Europe and **collective defence**]{.underline}; at the same time,
[Europeans will **support** Washington]{.underline} in containing China,
in diplomatic and economic terms. Therefore, when faced with US-China
"extreme competition", to use Biden's formulation, Europe will not be
able to remain neutral without paying a high price on the transatlantic
front.

To make this bargain functional, a more political NATO, and a more
globally wise NATO, must emerge -- and both dimensions require a
stronger NATO-EU link. This is because some of the solutions to shared
security challenges -- especially as far as hybrid threats are concerned
-- will come from EU member state decisions coordinated at the EU level.

Therefore, how to deal with China is becoming a key variable in
transatlantic relations. However, while this is extremely important in
strategic terms, it is less so in purely military terms: Washington is
not asking Europeans to support it militarily in Asia. Some individual
European allies are offering their (limited) help, but
[NATO]{.underline} as a whole [is bound to remain a regional defence
alliance.]{.underline} As a consequence -- and this is the second
priority -- the challenge for NATO is how to adopt a globally wise
perspective while preserving its core mission. If it does not adopt such
a global perspective, NATO could be side-lined, with a growing gap
between European and US security perceptions.

A more global NATO, while not engaging militarily in the Asia-Pacific
region, will have to confront the implications of China's rise for
Euro-Atlantic security. That means, for instance, [reducing European
vulnerabilities]{.underline} in value chains in strategic sectors,
monitoring strategic foreign investments, preserving technology edge,
countering cyber attacks, and [building up the resilience of democratic
societies.]{.underline} This widening of the very concept of security
necessarily involves the EU, with its economic leverage, more than it
ever did in the past. Thus, by definition, [improving the **coherence**
between NATO and the EU is becoming a key factor for transatlantic
**security**.]{.underline}

Accessed -- 6/22/2022, WWIS

For almost seventy years, NATO has positively influenced the world. The
Alliance's many credits include acting as a major factor in deterrence
of nuclear war, contributing to the erosion of the communist ideology of
the Soviet Union, and projecting stability in difficult places such as
Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. Although these measures of [past
performance indicate that NATO could continue to succeed in the future,
there are no guarantees. In fact, if the complex and adaptive [security
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} continues to evolve on its present
course, [it will become increasingly [difficult to maintain
cohesion]{.mark} of the Alliance. Arguably, it is one of the most
successful alliances in human history, but [without cohesion,
NATO]{.mark} can and [will fail]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Whether one agrees with Carl von Clausewitz's supposition that [the
[center of]{.mark} gravity of any [alliance]{.mark} is "[unity]{.mark}
formed by common interests" or not, no one can deny that if the members
are of one mind, an alliance exists.1 Conversely, [if]{.mark} the
[members do not have]{.mark} a [common understanding]{.mark}, an
[alliance does not exist.]{.mark}]{.underline} Between these two
extremes lie varying degrees of cohesion, and, as such, directly
proportional degrees of effectiveness, efficiency, and synergy. If one
makes the assertion that cohesion is a center of gravity of NATO, then
it becomes essential to identify the types of variables that affect the
strength of this center of gravity.

In the spring through the summer of 2017, the authors of this article
conducted in-depth research into the factors that contribute to or
detract from Alliance cohesion pursuant to the development of the
document The Framework for Future Alliance Operations.2 This article
summarizes the project's analysis of factors that could affect Alliance
cohesion in the future. It provides a model grounded in data to help
readers understand and visualize the aspects of cohesion. [It is an
exploration of the realm of the possible and acts]{.underline} as a
solemn warning to leaders of the [many possible ways the Atlantic
alliance could fracture in the future.]{.underline}

Underlying Conceptual Definitions

As with many research projects, this study began with an exploration of
conceptual definitions. The NATO Glossary defines a center of gravity as
the "characteristics, capabilities, or localities from which a nation,
an alliance, a military force, or other grouping derives its freedom of
action, physical strength or will to fight."3 This Clausewitzian
metaphor refers to a "focal point" as "the source of power that provides
moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act" for the
group.4 Rather than "characteristics, capabilities, or locations,"
centers of gravity can be "dynamic and powerful physical and moral
agents of action or influence."5 Even though some question the idea of a
center of gravity, the concept retains its relevance for many
contemporary planners as it helps them understand the complexities of
the security environment and the relationships between systems, as well
as prioritize efforts.6

The next key term, alliance cohesion, reflects the degree to which the
members are able to agree on goals, strategies, and tactics, and
coordinate activity for attaining those goals.7 In addition to this
behavioral component, cohesion represents the particular quality that
makes its members operate as a whole during times of crisis. Literature
from the psychology field defines cohesion as "bonds, either social or
task based, that contribute to the synergistic functioning as a whole."8
Other accounts claim "alliance cohesion is based upon the distance
between individual member interests and the collective alliance
interest."9 In defining this term, it is key to note that cohesion is a
very fluid idea, contextually based and highly subjective. Therefore,
this research proceeded under the assumption that cohesion is largely
qualitative in nature.

Some assert that the best moment to understand cohesion is in time of
crisis, such as when the Alliance faces a significant conflict. In case
of wartime alliances, cohesion refers to the states' ability to
coordinate military strategy, agree on war aims, and avoid making a
separate peace, together with "the degree of convergence among member
states' commitments to the alliance."10 This is important, since
conventional wisdom asserts the source of cohesion is usually the
element (be it political, economic, military, or nonmaterial) that is
targeted by adversary activities and likely results in the defeat of the
attacked party. It then follows that by adhering to these definitions,
one could consider Alliance cohesion to be at the level of a center of
gravity, since it "exerts a certain centripetal force that tends to hold

Many scholars in the fields of political science and international
relations have conducted research into the topic of cohesion.
Especially, the post-Cold War period led some to assert that cohesion
between North America and Europe is "no longer guaranteed by a commonly
acknowledged existential threat."12 With their national interests "less
predetermined by a priori ideological considerations," the "situational
nature of threats and challenges, capabilities, and commitments, and
interests and alignments" has directly affected Alliance cohesion.13 One
can therefore assume that if a direct existential threat exists, the
bond is stronger than when it does not.

Therefore, the first and the most parsimonious factor that emerges is
threat---a cognitive, or perceptual, concept, whose degree is mostly a
function of capabilities.14 Particularly, the level and source of threat
tell about the raison d'être of alliances and inform us about their
internal dynamics and durability.15 The alliance cohesion theory's
dominant explanation concerns the external threat to alliance.
Especially, the realist school of thought writes, "Alliances have no
meaning apart from the adversary threat to which they are a response,"
while being "maintained by stronger states to serve their interests."16

[The next key observation is that the [evolving security context]{.mark}
and disappearance of traditional alliance politics have led to the
default mode of uses of "coalitions of the willing" and "[alignments of
convenience]{.mark}."]{.underline}17 [Especially in terms of operations
in Afghanistan and Iraq, [cohesion]{.mark} has [become]{.mark}
"[challenged]{.mark} politically as well as militarily]{.underline}."18
Moreover, threat assessment differentials in terms of dissimilar
prioritization based on the perceived level of threat negatively affect
alliance cohesion to a significant extent. In the past few years,
cohesion waned as the multiplication of crises---including international
terrorism, mass migration, and Russian foreign policy---deepened
strategically the east-south division among NATO allies, and as the
Alliance's internal disputes intensified due to rising populism and
Euroscepticism.19 While these various "domestic pressures and diverging
threat perceptions are threatening to pull Allies apart," [[cohesion
"remains]{.mark} critically [dependent on]{.mark} its [collective
defense commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}."20

In outlining realist, economic, institutionalist, and
social-constructivist theoretical perspectives, other categories of
variables emerged: internal dimension of threats, bureaucracy and
alliance institutionalization, and shared values and identity. What
happens inside the Alliance could matter as much as what happens outside
the Alliance.

Given that NATO's endurance had not conformed to the predictions of
traditional alliance theory, Ohio University professor Patricia Weitsman
suggested examining internal and external threat dyads in order to
understand alliance cohesion.21 She found that NATO survived the end of
the Cold War due to low internal threat, which concerns the politics of
alliances. Consequently, this alliance cohesion theory says the lower
the internal threat, the more cohesive the alliance; and the greater the
external threat, the higher level of alliance cohesion.22

Another important factor in alliance cohesion is the way in which
intra-alliance cooperation institutionalizes bureaucratic structures.23
For instance, some assert that consultative norms and structures can
mitigate internal threats to cohesion.24 Furthermore, the Alliance's
institutional structures allow for information exchange among allies
that can raise the level of alliance cohesion independently from
external factors.25 Additionally, the transatlantic bond has depended on
credible signaling (i.e., an ally's trust in another's assurances).
Especially in the context of nuclear sharing, "weak signals" of U.S.
commitment to Europe could damage NATO's cohesion.26

[The next factor that emerges is that [tech]{.mark}nology and its rapid
[development]{.mark} remains omnipresent, [affect]{.mark}ing both the
relative operational [effectiveness]{.mark} and
[interoperability]{.mark} of the Alliance.]{.underline}27 Lastly, some
assert that [Alliance [cohesion flows from]{.mark} the degree of
[security community formation]{.mark} and the [socialization of]{.mark}
political and [military elites within]{.mark} and among democratic
[allies]{.mark} that possess a shared set of values and collective
identities.28]{.underline}

Having laid the conceptual foundation inspired by the existing scholarly
literature, this study explored, examined, and refined these ideas in an
attempt to ascertain the factors that affect the cohesion of NATO in a
practical sense.

Methodology

The primary research objective of this study was to identify and explore
which factors were likely to affect NATO's cohesion through 2035 and
beyond in terms of both risks and opportunities. This project targeted
students and professionals as the next generation of leaders from
different backgrounds (e.g., academia, military, industry, etc.) to
understand their perspectives on NATO's cohesion. The primary question
that guided this research was, "Which factors are likely to affect
NATO's cohesion through 2035 and beyond?"

The study followed a grounded theory methodology and employed both
quantitative and qualitative methods, triangulated with the scholarly
literature on alliance cohesion theory. Between March and June 2017,
researchers gathered data through a series of focus groups, an online
survey, and a workshop prepared in cooperation with the Innovation Hub
sponsored by NATO Allied Command Transformation. In total, almost one
hundred persons participated from across NATO and Partnership for Peace
nations.29 The researchers then analyzed the data with the objective of
identifying the thematic categories of variables and the organization of
these themes into a theoretical model grounded in the data.30

Findings: Five Cohesion Factors

In making sense of Alliance cohesion in the future, this study first
refined the understanding of cohesion itself. The findings indicate that
NATO's cohesion means synergy and the ability of NATO nations to think
and act together. That is, to develop shared interests, values, and
common standards and rules, and to respond to problems as a united
group. Relying on mutual trust, cohesion is "doing what is best for the
community" and looking beyond self-interests. Building on the analogy of
ties between family members, the participants stated that cohesion is an
expression of staying together despite differences, of "something bigger
than ourselves." One participant believed that "without cohesion, the
Alliance would implode."

Consequently, based on the scholarly literature and corroborated through
the focus groups, this study established that alliance cohesion
fluctuates in accordance with a variety of factors. The data collected
in this study indicated that variables that affect alliance cohesion
fell into five thematic areas: (1) external risks, (2) political and
economic factors, (3) organizational structures and processes, (4)
technology advances, and (5) core values (see figure 1).

External risks. The participants found it questionable whether allies
will be able to find a common conventional threat that would be
perceived as strong enough to "transcend the domestic pressures and the
concept of sovereignty." Although an absence of external threat to the
Alliance is very unlikely, the future risk will lie in multiplication of
external threats and a lack of common perception of those threats.

This underdeveloped common understanding of external threats,
accompanied by differential threat assessments, could weaken NATO's
cohesion. To illustrate this point, although the survey participants
listed the failure to activate Article 5 in case of attack as a
potential risk, further discussions showed that non-Article 5 missions
could constitute the real test for NATO's cohesion. In words of the one
of participants, "if there is an operation and only two nations show up,
this is not cohesion."

For some nations, this threat multiplication and dissimilar threat
perceptions can lead to an operational overstretch or to an eventual
"mission creep." In contrast, other nations might develop an excessive
sense of security that would lead them to reduce their attention and
willingness to participate in NATO activities. For this reason,
terrorism, for instance, cannot constitute NATO's defining threat.
Additionally, the changing nature of threats to allies' security will
require domestic, nonmilitary means to address them, rather than
alliance-wide military measures. In other words, "nations will be
looking inside to maintain order."

Political and economic factors. The group of political and economic
factors points to the risks of severe disagreements among the allies,
which could lead to the weakening of the transatlantic bond,
disintegration tendencies within the European Union, or even withdrawal
of a NATO nation from the Alliance.

At the level of political elites, the participants identified the crisis
of political leadership in NATO nations among the most probable causes
of weakening alliance cohesion in the future. Particularly, populist
leaders who prefer narrow, short-term political gains at home and who
are prepared to "undermine an international institution to gain
consensus internally" represent a serious threat to multilateralism, on
which the Alliance has depended. Oftentimes, national leaders "use NATO
as a scapegoat for their domestic political games," while "NATO does not
\[and cannot\] fight its own nations."

At the level of domestic population, the support for the Alliance in
member states can decline due to NATO's unclear purpose. This could
become an acute problem, especially if national leaders continue to
frame security problems exclusively in domestic terms instead of
treating them as NATO-wide. Particularly, concerns over sovereignty
could override the relative value of the Alliance's collective good and
make governments pull limited funds away from NATO.

In a similar vein, demographic shifts changing the socioeconomic and
cultural fabric of nations, such as an aging population and migration,
will drive differences in fiscal priorities, which could result in
decreasing national defense spending. Furthermore, if the free-riding
behavior reaches critical proportions within NATO burden sharing, it can
create, out of those who bear their fair share, a group of allies
disinterested in defending free-riding nations, as they could cease to
see "return on their investment."

[Organizational structures and processes. This project's focus groups
concluded that [NATO's]{.mark} rigid [organizational processes]{.mark}
that hold onto the past could [result in]{.mark} an Alliance "[unable to
evolve]{.mark} with member states' national interests." [Bureaucratic
politics]{.mark} within the Alliance structures could [cause]{.mark}
NATO's [slow adaptation]{.mark} to contemporary needs and values. For
instance, the participants listed the top-down defense planning process
of determining capability requirements as a case where the Alliance and
evolving national interests do not align.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, civil-military [frictions]{.mark} on both NATO and
national levels could [negatively affect readiness]{.mark} of the
forces. Long decision-making processes and [underdeveloped]{.mark}
institutional [procedures]{.mark} in national headquarters could
[prevent]{.mark} the Alliance from [developing]{.mark} a legal
[framework for]{.mark} a common course of [action]{.mark} under the NATO
flag; for instance, in addressing new adversaries that use
unconventional means such as cyber. Put simply, NATO cannot be faster
than the individual countries that make it up.]{.underline}

Lastly, size matters; cohesion is more difficult to forge and maintain
in an ever-enlarging alliance, especially when increasingly divergent
national interests tend to change the modus operandi of the Alliance.
More rather than less often, NATO's international staff will need to
find compromise during its decision-making processes between a political
and formal equality hoped to enhance Alliance cohesion on the one hand
and the desirable Alliance effectiveness on the other hand.

[**[Tech]{.mark}nology [advances]{.mark}**. The participants agreed that
technology advances are important for NATO's continued cohesion.
Technology will constitute a [significant intervening factor in]{.mark}
how [NATO]{.mark} nations [maintain]{.mark} their [cohesion]{.mark} in
the future [for three reasons. First]{.mark}, ever-evolving
[communication]{.mark} technology can [facilitate]{.mark} the [spread of
risks]{.mark} coming from outside of the Alliance and [exacerbate
their]{.mark} negative [effect]{.mark}. The examples that resonated the
most during focus group sessions are [info]{.mark}rmation
[warfare]{.mark} and targeted propaganda against NATO nations. Internet
communications technology creates infinite room for alternative media
that distort reality, contribute to the [emergence of]{.mark} populist
and [radical movements]{.mark}, and [increase]{.mark} the [danger of
miscommunication]{.mark} among nations.]{.underline}

[[Second, NATO risks losing]{.mark} the [innovation game to]{.mark} the
[commercial]{.mark} defense industrial [sector]{.mark}. In the future,
[private companies]{.mark} will continue to [stay ahead of NATO]{.mark}
in designing specifications and setting standards for platforms. This
can have a major [impact on readiness]{.mark} and
[interoperability]{.mark} among NATO nations if their innovation efforts
(e.g., the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) do not
materialize.31]{.underline}

[[Third]{.mark}, some [nations]{.mark} may become [reluctant to
share]{.mark} their [latest tech]{.mark}nology acquisitions, especially
if they put private gains above the collective endeavor. This would
[pose]{.mark} a [challenge]{.mark} "for anyone to share information they
own without gaining any profit for themselves." The political
unwillingness may [feed distrust]{.mark}, which can result in a
[deepening interoperability gap between allies]{.mark} on the
battlefield, and ultimately, a [less cohesive
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Interoperability\-\--2NC

#### US presence and influence in cooperative security is essential to NATO's operations

**Carafano, 20** (James Carafano, Vice President, Kathryn and Shelby
Cullom Davis Institute, 10-14-2020, \"A Golden Opportunity for the U.S.
to Lead NATO Into the Future,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/golden-opportunity-the-us-lead-nato-the-future)

as NATO's leader, the United States must ensure that the reflection
outcome firmly moors a future alliance to both sides of the
Atlantic, refocuses the allies on the raison d'être of collective
defense, and ensures NATO's readiness to address a range of growing
challenges. The latter, of course, requires robust defense spending and
vigorous capabilities in increasingly active arenas such as cyber- and
information warfare. 

The last time the alliance conducted a comprehensive review was in
2010, with NATO's Strategic Concept. A decade later, the world looks
drastically different. Russia's malign behavior has metastasized, from
its invasion of Ukraine to its illegal annexation of Crimea, and from
its attacks on Western democratic institutions to its brazen political
assassinations on European soil. At the same time, the alliance faces
emerging challenges including the rise of China, disinformation attacks,
global pandemics, and threats from terrorism.

[The reflection]{.underline} process should [start with the bedrock
principle that transatlantic security]{.underline}
(which encompasses American security) [is rooted in]{.underline} a
strong NATO, with [robust U.S. participation and]{.underline} continued
[leadership]{.underline}. [A strong NATO requires defense investment,
openness to future alliance enlargement, and **political willingness**
to commit to collective defense.   ]{.underline}

Those taking part in the reflection should be guided by 10 principles,
the most important of which is that NATO's number one
mission is collective defense. Everything else the alliance does is
secondary to that mission. 

In the 21st century, NATO needs to return to basics, with territorial
defense as its primary goal. NATO cannot try to be everywhere in the
world doing everything all the time. It should think long and hard
before leading and conducting additional out-of-area military
interventions. If the member states believe that an out-of-area military
operation is needed, it should probably be led by a coalition of the
willing outside the formal NATO command structure. 

The alliance should not seek out problems elsewhere in the world when
there is so much for NATO to do in its area of responsibility: "the
North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer."  

For instance, four regions in the Euro-Atlantic region need constant
NATO attention to deter Russian aggression: the Arctic, the Balkans, the
Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. A fifth, the Middle East-North Africa
region, requires [NATO's focus and attention to increase local capacity
building, improve **interoperability**, and
strengthen relations]{.underline}. There are a host of ways in which
NATO can bolster collective defense in these regions. The strategic
review should give full consideration to each and every one of them.  

Finally, while collective defense must remain NATO's core focus, the
alliance does have a role to play in meeting other growing challenges.
[Ensuring NATO's readiness to address these challenges requires an
understanding of where the alliance has been, where it is now, and where
it is headed.  ]{.underline}

For 70 years, NATO has underpinned European and North
American security and economic prosperity. While Macron's comments may
have been ill-advised and out of touch, they have ignited a vital
process by which the alliance can recommit itself to its most important
task: territorial defense of the member states; enabling collective
defense; and understanding NATO's proper role in responding to growing
challenges, as well as the tools it has to address them.  

[U.S. leadership has the opportunity and responsibility to ensure
that the **strategic reflection** process guarantees this vital alliance
remains vibrant and able to meet the challenges of the
21st century]{.underline}. Forget about the nightmare of
a zombie alliance. The ongoing period of reflection gives NATO the
chance to reaffirm, "It's alive. It's alive!"

We would like to bring the attention of our German Readers [[a recent
decision]{.underline}]{.mark} (published 13 January 2017) [of the
Federal Court of Justice]{.underline} (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) [[with
far-reaching implications]{.mark} for practitioners]{.underline}. In
essence, the BGH held that any prohibition to distribute a product
entails an obligation to actively recall any products already on the
shelves, endorsing the view expressed by the Oberlandesgericht Munich in
2013. The same dispute has already led to a judgment of the ECJ on 23
November 2016 (not related to the enforcement of the order).

Plaintiff had obtained an injunction based on unfair competition law
(UWG) against the mareting and distribution of alcoholic beverages under
the signs \"RESCUE DROPS\" and \"RESCUE NIGHT SPRAY\" (\"es zu
unterlassen, im geschäftlichen Verkehr als Spirituosen gekennzeichnete
Produkte unter der Bezeichnung „RESCUE TROPFEN" und/oder „RESCUE NIGHT
SPRAY" zu bewerben und/oder zu vertreiben\"). By its wording, the order
only entails an obligation to cease and desist, and not any obligation
to actively recall any products. The order became provisionally
enforceable.

Defendant failed to recall any products already sold to retailers
(primarily pharmacies). Plaintiff argued that this violated the order -
and prevailed. The BGH held that in a case where the continued presence
of the products on the shelves of retailers creates a continued
disturbance (\"fortdauernder Störungszustand\"), [the obligation to
cease and desist includes the obligation to remove the continued
disturbance]{.underline}, although generally, an obligation [[to
cease]{.underline}]{.mark} (Unterlassungspflicht) [**[must be
distinguished]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark} [an obligation
[to remove]{.mark}]{.underline} (Beseitigungspflicht). [It was further
irrelevant that the buyers of the products were not obliged to comply
with any request for a recall of the products]{.underline} (since they
have become the legal owners of the products). The key reasoning is in
paras. 24-27 of the decision for those who read German.

While the injunction in this case was based on unfair competition law,
it is hard to see that the outcome would have been any different for a
prohibition based on trade mark, copyright or patent law. In essence,
[any obligation [to cease]{.mark}]{.underline} distribution of a product
in Germany in the future also **[[entails]{.mark} the obligation [to
recall]{.mark}]{.underline}** products already distributed (and not yet
used up). Failure to do so makes the Defendant liable to pay the
administrative fine imposed by the order in case of non-compliance - in
the case at hand, EUR 15,000 for the omission of recalling the products.

should be verboten by both sides --- the U.S. actually is [far more
guilty of such
meddling](https://www.npr.org/2016/12/22/506625913/database-tracks-history-of-u-s-meddling-in-foreign-elections) than
is Russia. So should be cyber‐​expeditions, other than
intelligence‐​gathering, which is an inherent part of international
relations. [**[Washington should]{.mark} [be prepared]{.mark}** [to
retaliate, **but**]{.mark} [**cutting** **diplomatic staff**]{.mark} in
response **i[s]{.mark} perverse and
[counterproductive]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

European governments should take a similar approach. For instance, they
could offer to drop repeated complaints that Russia is not a democracy
--- were they really shocked to discover this fact? --- in return, say,
for Moscow halting assassinations on European soil. After all, the
Europeans' humanitarian sensitivities instantly disappear when it comes
to accepting Saudi money for weapons used to kill Yemeni civilians.
Brussels has similarly accommodated Turkey, which has kidnapped
perceived enemies, meaning most anyone who criticizes [President Recep
Tayyip
Erdoğan](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/instead-of-warmongering-trump-should-throw-turkey-out-of-nato/),
from Europe.

[Even more important, **the [U.S. and]{.mark} its [NATO allies]{.mark}
[should]{.mark}** offer to **[end NATO expansion]{.mark}**. Inclusion
of [North
Macedonia](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/america-doesnt-need-another-weakling-nato-ally/) and [Montenegro](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2017/03/07/montenegro-awaits-senate-verdict-president-donald-trump-should-end-nato-expansion-charade/?sh=30d4012c5261) (at
least the latter is a great movie set!) demonstrate that the process has
outrun any potential usefulness. What's next? Bringing in the [Duchy of
Grand Fenwick](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053084/)? Most important,
[the U.S. should pledge]{.mark} that [neither Georgia]{.mark}
[nor]{.mark} [Ukraine will be added]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, this
decision should have been reached long ago. Including them is not in
America's interest --- they would bring conflict and controversy into
the alliance --- and could trigger escalation by Russia.

[[In return,]{.mark} [Moscow should]{.mark} end its [support for]{.mark}
Ukrainian [separatists,]{.mark} [while Kyiv]{.mark} [should
follow]{.mark} its [promise and grant]{.mark} greater [autonomy]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the [Donbass region]{.mark}. Ukraine would be politically
and militarily neutral but left to decide its own economic destiny. Such
a compromise might displease Ukrainians, who of course would remain free
to set their own course. But they have no right to NATO membership and
defense by America. The U.S. should simply make clear the Americans
won't be coming --- whether it is military aid today or soldiers (and
possibly nukes) tomorrow.]{.underline}

#### Bilateral negotiations [solve]{.underline}\-\--[both]{.underline} Biden and Putin want to [limit]{.underline} the risk of escalation.

Amy F. **Woolf 22**, specialist in nuclear weapons policy, 2/28/2022,
"Nuclear Arms Control After the Biden-Putin Summit,"
<https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11694>, RH

[Presidents [**Biden** and **Putin** reaffirmed "the principle that a
nuclear war cannot be won]{.mark} and must never be
fought]{.underline}." Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had
issued this statement in 1985, when they indicated that they were
"conscious of the special responsibility of the USSR and the U.S. for
maintaining peace." By issuing this statement, Reagan and Gorbachev
recognized the need to ease tensions that might lead to a conflict that
could escalate to nuclear war. Some [[experts]{.mark} have [suggested
that a U.S.-Russian reaffirmation of this statement might]{.mark} help
[bolster]{.mark} international **[nonprolif]{.mark}eration
[efforts]{.mark}** [by reducing the]{.mark} perceived [value of
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On January 3,
2022, the five nuclear weapons states recognized by the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (known as the P5) also affirmed this statement.
Some have suggested that both [[the]{.mark} U.S.-Russian [reaffirmation
and]{.mark} the [P5 confirmation]{.mark} might [offset the impression
that nuclear]{.mark} weapons [states]{.mark} seem to [view these weapons
as a viable tool]{.mark} to address regional security
challenges]{.underline}. The statement might also signal that the
[[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [states recognize the **growing risks**
of]{.mark} nuclear [escalation]{.mark} during **crises**.]{.underline}
Others, however, have questioned the value of the statement in the
current security environment, noting that, in 1985, it was a reflection
on the risk of large-scale nuclear war between the United States and
Soviet Union. Moreover, some argue that a statement excluding the
possible use of nuclear weapons in a regional conflict could undermine
efforts to deter large-scale conventional attacks or even
[cyberattacks]{.underline}. Some have also questioned whether the United
States might have to alter its employment policy or force posture if it
acceded to a statement forswearing the value of nuclear weapons in
regional conflicts. The Biden Administration has not addressed questions
about its rationale for reaffirming the statement. When it issued its
Interim National Security Strategic Guidance in March 2021, it noted
that [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would "take steps to
**reduce** the role of **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** in our
**national security** strategy."]{.underline} Reissuing this statement
on nuclear war may contribute to that goal without foreshadowing any
changes in the U.S. nuclear posture.

[Presidents [**Biden** and **Putin**]{.mark} agreed that the United
States and Russia [would engage in "a]{.mark}n integrated
**[bilateral]{.mark}** Strategic [Stability **Dialogue**" that
would]{.mark} "seek to [lay the groundwork for]{.mark} future [arms
control]{.mark} and risk reduction measures."]{.underline} The United
States and Russia had engaged in similar talks in the past, and [both
**Presidents** supported their **resumption** prior to the
summit]{.underline}. In his press briefing following the summit,
President [**Biden** noted that [this **dialogue** would allow
diplomats]{.mark} "[to work on a **mechanism** that can]{.mark} lead to
[control]{.mark} of new and **[dangerous]{.mark}** and sophisticated
[weapons]{.mark} that are coming on the scene now that reduce the times
of response]{.underline}, that raise the prospects of accidental war."

[[The U.S.-Russian]{.mark} strategic stability
[talks]{.mark}]{.underline} will likely not include other nations with
nuclear weapons--- such as China, France, and the United Kingdom---but
[[could include discussions about]{.mark} other types of weapons beyond
the long-range **[strategic weapons]{.mark}** [limited in New
START]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the two nations may hold different
views on which topics they should discuss and different understandings
of what constitutes strategic stability. In early September 2021, Bonnie
Jenkins, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for International Security
and Arms Control, noted that the United States would seek to capture new
kinds of intercontinental-range nuclear delivery systems and
nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the upcoming talks. [**Russia** appears
to favor a **broader agenda**; Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has noted
that the discussions should include everything that "influences
strategic stability,]{.underline}" [including "nuclear and non-nuclear
weapons, offensive and defensive weapons]{.underline}." For Russia, this
list includes ballistic missile defense, longrange strategic
conventional arms, and weapons in space. At the same time, with its
mention of "arms control and risk reduction measures," the joint
statement also seems to indicate that the talks will not focus
exclusively on negotiating a new treaty limiting nuclear weapons. They
might also address transparency and risk reduction measures that could
reduce the risk of inadvertent or intentional escalation to nuclear use
during a crisis or conflict. The agenda could also include emerging
technologies, operational practices, or doctrinal statements that might
exacerbate tensions or complicate crisis management.

#### Empirics [prove]{.underline}\-\--US-Russia relations have [resolved]{.underline} crisis through diplomacy.

relations and U.S. foreign policy, "A secret Deal With Putin Might Be
the Only Way Biden Can End the Ukraine Crisis,"

[With [Russian troops moving closer to the Ukrainian border from
multiple
angles](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/02/11/russias-military-build-up-enters-a-more-dangerous-phase),
the chance of war creeps higher by the day. Yet Presidents Joe **[Biden
and]{.mark}** Vladimir **[Putin are]{.mark}** still **[hinting
a]{.mark}t** the possibility of [a **diplomatic**]{.mark}
**[solution]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would offer Putin a
face-saving way out of the crisis he created.

The question is whether they can---and are willing to---devise a
mutually palatable deal, given the dense tangle of conflicting interests
driving this conflict. [There is a way to cut the knot: **[Biden
could]{.mark}** borrow a move from John F. Kennedy's playbook and
**[offer Putin]{.mark} [a secret]{.mark} [deal.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Here is the current state of affairs. After Putin and Biden's hour-long
phone conversation on Saturday, [the White House
read-out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/12/readout-of-president-bidens-call-with-president-vladimir-putin-of-russia/) made
it seem nothing had changed; [[Biden]{.mark}, it said[, warned]{.mark}
once again of "[swift]{.mark} and severe [costs"]{.mark} if Russia
invaded]{.underline} Ukraine. Period.

However, at a press conference in Moscow later in the day, Putin aide
Yuri Ushakov revealed that much more was discussed. [**[Biden]{.mark}**,
he said, [recalled the long record of **cooperation**]{.mark} between
[the two countries]{.mark}, noted the many issues on which they still
[needed to **cooperate**]{.mark}, and offered several diplomatic
compromises to the crisis]{.underline} (Ushakov did not detail what they
were). Putin said he would think them over, but complained that the West
was ignoring his fundamental demand---that [[**Ukraine** never join
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (A still-later background press briefing
by a "senior administration official" confirmed Ushakov's account.)

Biden, Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have all taken
maximalist positions on this issue: [Biden says NATO's open-door policy
can't be shut permanently on Ukraine; Putin says it must be; Zelensky
keeps asking to join the U.S.-led **military alliance**]{.underline}.
Any backing away from these positions would be seen as an act of
weakness: [[U.S. **credibility** would be shot]{.underline}]{.mark};
[**Putin** would lose what he sees as his last chance to restore
Russia's sphere of influence on its western border;]{.underline}
Zelensky would be hounded by anti-Russia nationalists who view any
compromise as treason.

[The question is whether they can]{.underline}---and are willing
to---[devise a mutually palatable deal, given the dense tangle of
conflicting interests driving this conflict.]{.underline} There is a way
to cut the knot: Biden could borrow a move from John F. Kennedy's
playbook and offer Putin a secret deal.

In the end, Kennedy instructed his brother, Robert Kennedy, the attorney
general (who also opposed the missile trade), to go see Soviet
Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and say we would take the trade---but only
if it was kept secret. If the Soviets revealed he accepted the deal, it
would be called off. Kennedy told just six of his advisers about his
agreement. (He deeply feared the political consequences of compromising
with the Kremlin.) To everyone else, and the rest of the world, he put
out a cover story, claiming he'd rejected the missile trade but instead
accepted a proposal that Khrushchev had put forth the night before: that
he would remove his missiles if Kennedy promised never to invade the
Communist island of Cuba.

The next day, Sunday, Oct. 29, Khrushchev announced he would remove the
missiles, reciting the fictional cover story.

Remarkably, [this deal was kept secret for a long time]{.underline}.
Only in 1982, on the 20th anniversary of the crisis, when the existence
of the tapes was about to be revealed, did McNamara, Bundy, and other
advisers reveal the true story---or at least part of it. (They did not
confess that they had all opposed the secret deal.)

If the deal had not been struck, U.S. air strikes were scheduled to
begin two days later, on Monday, Oct. 30---500 conventional bombing
raids per day, for five days, followed by a ground invasion of the
island. Some of the Soviet missiles were already armed with nuclear
warheads; they might have been launched in retaliation. And, though it
wasn't known at the time, the Soviets had secretly deployed 40,000
troops on Cuba to fend off a possible U.S. invasion. In other words, by
taking Khrushchev's deal, John Kennedy might have singlehandedly
prevented World War III.

What does all this have to do with the [**Ukraine crisis** of
2022]{.underline}? Putin has proposed a way out---keep Ukraine out of
NATO---that everyone, in this case including Biden, is denouncing as
unacceptable, even while admitting that Ukraine won't be allowed into
NATO for a long time, if ever.

[[The]{.mark} simplest [solution]{.mark} would be for Biden to just take
Putin's deal---[bar Ukraine from]{.mark} ever entering
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. But there are three problems with that idea.
First, it's an impossible promise; even if Biden wanted to make it,
there's no way to shut out Ukraine forever. Second, U.S. influence in
the world would tumble; every other ally would soon be looking for
another protector. Even John Kennedy, back in 1962, knew that he
couldn't accept Khrushchev's deal publicly. [He had to make it in
**secret**]{.underline}. (He even lied to his predecessor, Dwight
Eisenhower. When he informed the former five-star general that the
crisis was over, Eisenhower asked if he'd made a backroom deal. Kennedy
said that he hadn't.)

Would it be possible to keep such a pledge secret in today's
media-soaked environment? Back in 1962, Kennedy and his advisers met for
13 days in the Cabinet Room without any mention of the meetings being
leaked to the press. That would be unthinkable now. But what about a
secret deal with Putin, a man who has no problem with secrets?

Here is one way to do this---maybe. [[**Biden** could secretly send an
**emissary**]{.mark} to see Putin]{.underline}. CIA Director William
Burns would be a good choice; he has made low-profile trips Moscow
before. Burns could bring along this assurance: Ukraine will not join
NATO for as long as Biden is president; in practical terms, that is the
most that any president could promise. However, he could add, if Putin
makes this pledge public, the deal would be off---and, in fact, he could
count on Ukraine joining the alliance next week.

In addition, Burns could go on, if Russia pulled its troops away from
Ukraine, back to their original bases, [[Biden]{.mark} [would do]{.mark}
all the things he has proposed in recent talks, and take various
[**confidence building** measures to put U.S.-Russian relations
on]{.mark} more [stable footing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Some possibilities: [[Re-open **arms control** treaties that]{.mark}
President **[Trump abrogated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Open up all
military exercises and missile deployments in the region to inspectors.
Convene a conference on European security, to include consideration of
Russian interests and concerns. Open negotiations to settle ambiguities
in the Minsk Agreements, the ceasefire accord that Russia and Ukraine
signed in 2015 but have never implemented because of differing
interpretations. Senior U.S. and Russian officials have mentioned the
revival of Minsk as a way out of the crisis. It is now time to test the
proposition.

### Solvency\-\--Ext

#### Negotiating Putin's complaints about Europe [opens the door]{.underline} to good faith negotiations.

Juan **Diaz-Prinz 22**, Acting Director at the Inclusive Peace Processes
and Reconciliation, 6/12/2022, "Another Way to Help Ukraine: Prepare Now
for a Peace Process,"
<https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/06/another-way-help-ukraine-prepare-now-peace-process>,
RH

[[Why]{.mark}, then, [prepare for **peace talks**]{.mark}
now?]{.underline} [A first reason is [the **unpredictability** of
**war**]{.mark}, which dictates that the advantageous moment for a shift
to negotiations could appear without warning]{.underline} --- and could
disappear just as suddenly. A full strategy of support for Ukraine
requires that its supporters help to prepare it to make the most of
negotiations if and when Ukraine has the opportunity to benefit from
them.

Thus, [[even as]{.mark} Western [**democracies** rush]{.mark} arms and
**[assistance]{.mark}** to Ukraine, strategic [preparation]{.mark} now
[for a]{.mark}n eventual [**peace process** can]{.mark} [lead to]{.mark}
a broader set of choices, with a [better chance of success]{.mark}, as
Ukraine's government calculates its options]{.underline}. That
preparation also positions Ukraine and its allies to more quickly halt
bloodshed whenever conditions emerge for negotiations.

[**Russia** and **Ukraine** currently have nothing to offer each other
that could support peace talks to halt the war]{.underline}. Thus, a
starting point in strategically preparing for talks is to envision a
structure for negotiations that offers each side the chance to bargain
for something it wants. In many wars --- and assuredly in this one ---
[**[enticing]{.mark}** an aggressive belligerent like [Russia
into]{.mark} a [peace]{.mark} process [may require expanding]{.mark} the
field for [negotiations beyond]{.mark} the issues that triggered the
**[hostilities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[A way to draw Putin into]{.mark} eventual [peace]{.mark}
talks]{.underline} --- and into negotiating over his control of
Ukrainian territory --- [[will be to offer him the]{.mark} [chance to
bargain]{.mark} directly [with the **U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates** over his broader complaints]{.underline}. Essentially,
this will mean [[a **negotiation** over]{.mark} what Putin thinks is
[Russia's]{.mark} unfair **marginalization** as a great power and the
**[security]{.mark}** and **economic** [threats]{.mark} to Russia [of
expanding NATO]{.mark} and EU strategic influence]{.underline}. Indeed,
some have argued (against most evidence) that [[a **root** of the
**conflict** lies]{.mark} not in Ukraine but [in the]{.mark} Russian
[desire for a **reform** of]{.mark} the [European **security
architecture**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A viable peace process that creates
a path for Ukraine to seek a recovery of territory seized by Russian
arms will need to include these two elements:

[Broaden a peace process beyond simply **Russia-Ukraine** negotiations
to include a separate negotiation that includes **Europe** and
**NATO**]{.underline}. To encourage Russia to make difficult concessions
to Ukraine (notably a withdrawal from territories Russia has seized in
war), the peace process should proceed simultaneously on three levels.
[Russia-Ukraine [talks would address their **bilateral
disputes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second[, Russian [talks]{.mark} [with
the **E**]{.mark}**uropean [U]{.mark}nion** and Ukraine [would aim to
**reset** their **relations**]{.mark} (disrupted since 2014) and seek
agreement on economic and security arrangements for countries, like
Ukraine, that lie between Russia and the EU zone]{.underline}. Given the
failures of earlier diplomacy, involving the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, [[to resolve the **Russia-Ukraine**]{.mark}
**crisis**[, it will be necessary to **reform** that]{.mark}
[organization]{.mark} and re-establish it as a long-term
confidence-building measure to prevent future regional
conflicts]{.underline}. Finally, [[**Russia** talks with]{.mark}
**[NATO]{.mark}** and the **United States** [would take up issues of
**strategic stability**]{.mark} [and the U.S.-Russian
relationship]{.mark} in the world order.]{.underline} While some would
argue that broadening the negotiations would just reward Putin for his
use of force, only this full combination of negotiations, equal and
interlocking, might entice him into making concessions to Ukraine.

[Keep the status of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia undetermined
pending the completion of negotiations.]{.underline} To avoid the risk
of Russia consolidating its control over parts of Ukraine it has
captured, a peace process could establish that space as a buffer zone
under U.N. or other third-party control until negotiations are complete.
This would require a peacekeeping mission of some kind in that zone.
[This step also would serve as a confidence-building measure until a
**negotiated solution** can be reached.]{.underline} The longer the war
goes on, the more opportunity Russia will have to cement its hold on the
substantial swaths of territory Ukraine has lost already with "facts on
the ground," and to cover up war crimes there. Internationalizing the
negotiations and inserting peacekeepers could win time and space to
achieve a better outcome through non-military means.

As in any war, the lengthening of the conflict, the losses on each side
and the political entrenchment of belligerents' demands can make it more
difficult, or even politically dangerous, for leaders to make
concessions. The better chance of winning concessions will come from a
broad process that can address the many issues in dispute, including
many that risk hardening in place a new Cold War. [[These will
include]{.mark} nuclear [**arms control,** **cyber warfare**]{.mark},
Russia's role in distant conflict zones, and mutual accusations by
Russia and the West that each is **interfering** in the other's
political systems]{.underline}. While Ukraine's territorial integrity
and status seem like the biggest obstacles to a peace deal, issues such
as the investigation of war crimes, accountability for rebuilding
Ukraine and Russia's future role in the region may prove more difficult.

Critically, [the **European Union** and [Russia will have to **reset**
their **relationship**]{.mark},]{.underline} which collapsed after
Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. [Europe's **sanctions** on Russia and
divestment from **dependency** on Russian **oil** and gas pose long-term
costs for both sides. [Enticing Putin]{.mark} [to offer
**concessions**]{.mark} to Ukraine [might be achieved by]{.mark}
creating a broader zone for [**negotiating** his **complaints** against
Europe]{.mark}, the United States and NATO.]{.underline} The key to all
three negotiations is to ensure that they include regional neighbors and
that all sides see a chance to make political and economic gains at
different tables while also creating disincentives for prolonging the
war. The question is not whether to talk to the Russians or not, it's
what to talk to them about --- and when.

#### Putin's [clearly]{.underline} signaled he seeks [improved relations]{.underline}.

Sumantra **Maitra, 22** (4/22; National Security Fellow at the Center
for the National Interest., PhD in International Relations from
University of Nottingham; "A lost opportunity of a grand bargain:
Security architecture between NATO and Russia" Research Gate

// LVL

In that light, however, several CBMs can be thought of. First, [a
[further NATO enlargement]{.mark} [pause should be]{.mark} seriously
[considered, regardless of a war in Ukraine. Russia seeks a new grand
bargain]{.mark}, not tinkering within the old order.]{.underline} The
morphing of an alliance from a defensive one to a political one is the
thorny issue here, not a superficial alteration in force posture. NATO
expansion has been a cause of serious debates since the early nineties,
and with new evidence, the older strategic debates are returning to the
forefront. In the current structural format, one can even argue that
[[NATO has outlived its original purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
reversing any enlargement of NATO or curtailing the NATO bureaucracy
remains out of the question due to sheer political necessity, any
further enlargement will jeopardize regional balance to the point where
it might lead to an unnecessary conflict. An alliance is a grouping of
states based on shared interests, and the interests in a bloated diluted
group are fundamentally diverse, resulting in the hollowing of a core
security guarantee and encouraging freeriding in some parts of the
alliance and evangelical values promotion in other parts. In fact,
evangelical smaller powers who genuinely worry about a revanchist Russia
and American interest declining and its security umbrella weakening,
should oppose any further expansion, as that would almost inevitably
result in further erosion of strategic interests. Realism for a great
power is to avoid needlessly being dragged into a potential great power
conflict to defend peripheral interests, on behalf of smaller,
unimportant, strategically insignificant but ideologically evangelical
powers.14 A potential review of the weapons and platforms available to
Ukraine might be a stick to the aforementioned carrot. Recently,
military aid packages were delivered to Ukraine, a continuation of
long-term aid which included anti-tank missiles, small arms, training,
tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, night-vision, and patrol boats. While
this continued the bloodletting on both sides, it failed to nullify
Russia's advantage. However, this could be a bargaining chip as it is
within the rights and capability of the US to massively increase the
cost of Russian misadventure. Russia should be reminded that while it
has the capability to invade and overwhelm Ukraine, an insurgency aided
by Western weapons in that region would be far more brutal, compared to
Chechnya in the mid-nineties, in the eventuality of an actual war.
Concurrently, a grand bargain to pull Russia back into the European
fold, and further isolate China, would also include temporary ceasing of
what the Russians consider NGO warfare, and a financial aid and
promotion of "rights" and "civil societies" in post-Soviet space, in
case Russia is dissuaded from an invasion. It is a hard sell in
Washington, DC as much as it is a hard sell in parts of Eastern Europe,
and would require a deft back-channel diplomacy. Finally, since the
Russian side needs a security guarantee of a no-expansion pledge, a
counter concrete written assurance from Russia and deft back-channel
diplomacy to secure stability and a potential grand bargain is to be
expected, one that will entail a much-needed focus on the Asian theatre.
[The Russian president Vladimir [Putin's statement]{.mark} contained a
reference to the "Euro-Atlantic region" that would include the US and
Canada. Russia does not always use this particular rhetoric. It was not
an ultimatum to practiced ears, but [a plea for a **grand
bargain**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While the total EU GDP, not to
mention manpower, dwarfs Russia, [Russia still is a great power and has
enormous mischief power in its near abroad.]{.underline} [Clever
diplomacy could initiate a Ukrainian state official
neutrality]{.underline}, in a model similar to the Austrian
Neutralitatserkl ¨ arung ¨ in 1955, an idea that is increasingly gaining
traction among a certain section of Washington's policy circles.15
Combined, all of these [[policies]{.mark} [could]{.mark} potentially
[end the conflict]{.mark} and initiate a "negative-peace," stop the loss
of lives and bloodletting, potentially [stabilize Russian
insecurity]{.mark}, and in the long run [result in better
Russian-Western relations]{.mark}, as well as provide a neutral buffer
space [and]{.mark} a potential [long-term security
architecture.]{.mark}]{.underline} While chances of a war are high, and
bringing Russia back into the mainstream European fold is a long-term
aim, for now, a peaceful eastern frontier of EU and NATO would be
beneficial for a long-term pivot towards the Asia-Pacific.

LVL)

But the abundance of evidence that [[NATO]{.mark} was a sustained
[source of anxiety for Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} raises the question
of whether the United States' strategic posture was not just imprudent
but negligent. The fact that the NATO status question was not put on the
table as Putin signaled that he was serious about an invasion --- so
plainly that the U.S. government was spelling it out with day-by-day
updates --- was an error, and potentially a catastrophic one. It may
sound cruel to suggest that Ukraine could be barred, either temporarily
or permanently, from entering a military alliance it wants to be in. But
what's more cruel is that Ukrainians might be paying with their lives
for the United States' reckless flirtation with Ukraine as a future NATO
member without ever committing to its defense. Analysts say it's widely
known that Ukraine had no prospect of entering NATO for many years,
possibly decades, because of its need for major democracy and
anti-corruption reforms and because NATO has no interest in going to war
with Russia over Ukraine's Donbas region, where Russia has meddled and
backed armed conflict for years. [But by dangling the possibility of
Ukraine's NATO membership for years but never fulfilling it, [NATO
created a scenario that emboldened Ukraine to act tough and buck
Russia]{.mark} --- without any intention of directly defending Ukraine
with its firepower if Moscow decided Ukraine had gone too
far.]{.underline} [But for the West to offer to compromise on Ukraine's
future entry into NATO would have required admitting the limitations of
Western power]{.underline}. "[It was the desire of Western governments
not to lose face by compromising with Russia]{.underline}," Anatol
Lieven, senior research fellow on Russia and Europe at the Quincy
Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of "Ukraine and
Russia: A Fraternal Rivalry," told me. "But it was also the moral
cowardice of so many Western commentators and officials and ex-officials
who would not come out in public and admit that this was no longer a
viable project." The West didn\'t want to set limits on NATO\'s
enlargement and influence or lose face. So what it did was gamble. "The
choice that we faced in Ukraine --- and I\'m using the past tense there
intentionally --- was whether Russia exercised a veto over NATO
involvement in Ukraine on the negotiating table or on the battlefield,"
said George Beebe, a former director of Russia analysis at the CIA and
special adviser on Russia to former Vice President Dick Cheney. "And we
elected to make sure that the veto was exercised on the battlefield,
hoping that either Putin would stay his hand or that the military
operation would fail." What\'s happened has happened, and there's no
going back. But it still matters. The [**[U.S. must]{.mark} [do
everything]{.mark}** it can do [to end this war]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
which is already brutalizing [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, rattling
the global economy, and [[could]{.mark} quite [easily spiral into a
**nuclear-armed confrontation**]{.mark} between the U.S. and
Russia,]{.underline} if things get out of hand --- as swiftly as
possible, including negotiating on Ukraine\'s NATO status and possible
neutrality with an open mind. And over the longer term, Americans must
realize that [[in an increasingly multipolar world, reckoning with the
limits of]{.mark} their [power is critical for achieving a more
peaceful]{.mark} and just [world.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO was
originally formed as a military and political alliance between the U.S.,
Canada and several Western European nations in 1949. It was meant to
serve as a collective defense organization to contain the Soviet Union
during the Cold War, and its most important provision, Article 5, held
that an attack on one member of the alliance was an attack against all
of them. In 1990, [the [West led the Soviets to believe NATO would not
expand further eastward]{.mark} across Europe]{.underline} in exchange
for Germany reunification and the agreement that the new Germany would
be a NATO member. Most famously, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
once assured Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that the NATO alliance
would move "not one inch eastward" in exchange for this agreement, but
as the late Princeton University scholar Stephen Cohen pointed out in
2018, this pledge was in fact made multiple times by several Western
countries. [These [assurances were not honored]{.mark}, [and NATO has
expanded]{.mark} eastward over the years to include many more countries,
[all the way]{.mark} up [to Russia's borders.]{.mark}]{.underline} "It
is the broken promise to Gorbachev that lingers as America's original
sin," Cohen said then. NATO's expansion was hugely controversial in
policy circles in the 1990s. As foreign policy commentator Peter Beinart
has noted, around the time the Clinton administration was considering
NATO in the \'90s to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic ---
a debate that almost caused President Bill Clinton\'s Secretary of
Defense William Perry to resign --- many influential voices dissented:
"George Kennan, the living legend who had fathered America's policy of
containment against the Soviet Union, called [[NATO expansion]{.mark}
"[a strategic blunder]{.mark} of potentially epic
proportions]{.underline}." Thomas Friedman, America's most prominent
foreign policy columnist, declared it the "most ill-conceived project of
the post-Cold War era." Daniel Patrick Moynihan, widely considered the
most erudite member of the US Senate, warned, "We have no idea what
we're getting into." John Lewis Gaddis, the dean of America's Cold War
historians, noted that, "historians---normally so contentious---are in
uncharacteristic agreement: with remarkably few exceptions, they see
[NATO [enlargement]{.mark} as ill-conceived, ill-timed, and above all
[ill-suited to the realities of the post-Cold War
world."]{.mark}]{.underline} The major concern was that
[[expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} would backfire --- that it would, as
Kennan put it in 1997, "[[inflame the]{.mark} nationalistic,
[anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russia]{.mark}n
opinion]{.underline}." Indeed, [[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} hated it.
As Lieven previously told me, for decades the Russian political
establishment and commentators have vociferously objected to NATO
expansion and "[[warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that if this went as far as
taking in Georgia and Ukraine, then there would be
[[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} and strong likelihood of war."
Russia is no longer at the helm of a global superpower, but it is still,
at the very least, a regional great power, and as such it devotes
considerable resources to exerting its influence beyond its borders and
using the states around it as buffers. [[Russia views Ukraine]{.mark}, a
large country to which it has long-running cultural and historical ties,
[as a]{.mark} particularly [critical buffer state for protecting its
capital]{.mark}. The issue that [Russia saw]{.mark} in [NATO was not
just an expanding military alliance, but]{.mark} one that had shifted
gears to transforming and [proactively intervening in global
affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the end of the Cold War, NATO's
raison d'être no longer existed, but instead of disbanding, its mission
shifted to democracy promotion. The carrot of membership in NATO was
used to encourage countries to adopt liberalization and good governance
and align with U.S. political, economic and military interests. Of
particular concern to the Russians have been NATO's operations outside
of NATO countries. [The [Russians were shocked]{.mark} by NATO's bombing
campaign in Yugoslavia, [where NATO]{.mark} not only [intervened in the
affairs of a non-NATO country]{.mark}, but [took sides against]{.mark}
the Serbs, [allies of the Russians]{.mark}, and did so without United
Nations Security Council approval. [NATO has also been involved in
regime change]{.mark} and nation-building projects in places like Libya
and Afghanistan.]{.underline} "NATO is a defensive organization; I
don\'t think it had any plans on Russia," Thomas Graham, a former
special assistant to the president and senior director for Russia on the
National Security Council staff from 2004 to 2007, said regarding NATO's
expansion of territory and widening scope of operations. "All that said
... [[if you put yourself in the position of people in the Kremlin, you
can see why they came to that conclusion]{.underline}."]{.mark} Things
turned up a notch in 2008, when NATO declared that Ukraine and Georgia
"will become members" of NATO. It did not specify a timeline, and it was
assumed that it was conditional on the countries adopting political
reforms, but it infuriated the Russians. As a way to reassert its
dominance in the region, Russia invaded Georgia later that year. In
another sign of Russia's intolerance of losing out to Western influence
in those countries, Putin annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in
2014 in the wake of the protest-spurred ouster of Ukraine's
Russia-friendly president, which the West favored. John Mearsheimer, an
international relations scholar at the University of Chicago, argued
that a number of factors, including Ukraine's potential integration into
the Western European economy, played a role in Russia's concerns in
2014, but [NATO enlargement was the "taproot" of the crisis and [Russia
wanted to make sure that, among other things, a NATO base couldn't be
set up in Crimea as Ukraine drifted toward the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Mearsheimer also warned that this was foreshadowing, and Ukraine's
pseudo-membership status was going to bait Moscow and result in
catastrophe. "The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path, and
the end result is Ukraine is going to get wrecked," he said in a
lecture. Russia has grown concerned again about Ukraine for a number of
reasons. Analysts like Lieven and Beebe point out that Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken a number of sharp measures to
eradicate Russian influence in Ukraine recently by doing things like
banning the use of Russian language in schools and state institutions,
shutting down Kremlin-linked television stations and arresting some of
the most prominent Russo-sympathetic leaders in the country --- all
while cooperating on the ground with NATO. Russia read this as a sign
that Kyiv was throwing its lot in with the U.S. and the prospect of an
agreement ensuring autonomy for the separatist-held Donbas region,
crucial to Russia's plan to thwart Ukraine's NATO entry, might be dead.
All this brings us to the crisis at hand. The takeaway of this very
quick survey is not to convince you to agree with Russia's assessment
that NATO posed an existential threat to it or that it is justified in
its great power politicking. As Beebe put it, [[whether or not Russia's
perception is accurate]{.mark} or justified "[is immaterial]{.mark} to
whether that perception is genuinely held and to whether they will act
on that perception." [What matters is]{.mark} that there is clear
evidence [that **Russia sees NATO as destabilizing**, pro-democratic and
anti-Russian]{.mark} --- and clear evidence that it was willing to use
force to counter NATO\'s enlargement.]{.underline} Moreover, Putin sent
clear signals that he was serious about pulling the trigger if he
didn\'t get something. Shifting some 150,000 troops along Ukraine's
border for weeks was a real cost, and it placed pressure on him to not
back down without extracting a major concession and risk losing face in
front of Russia's political elite. "I thought, and continue to think,
that [[**we should have made a deal**, that there was a deal to be had
--- not a deal that we liked]{.mark}, obviously, [but a deal that the
realities of the situation that we\'re facing
required]{.mark}]{.underline}," Beebe said.

#### Russia doesn't threaten the US.

**Bandow, 21** (Doug Bandow, 6-8-21, assistant to President Ronald
Reagan and fellow specializing in foreign policy and civil liberties,

This still doesn't justify Moscow's brutal response in Ukraine, of
course. But having destroyed Iraq based on a lie, thereby destabilizing
the region, unleashing al‐​Qaeda/​ISIS, empowering Iran, wrecking minority
religious communities, and unleashing a tsunami of sectarian violence
that killed hundreds of thousands of people[,
[Washingto]{.underline}]{.mark}[n officials [should dispense
with]{.mark} the [sanctimony]{.mark}.]{.underline} Or they might ask
Mexico, which lost half of its territory to an aggressive, young United
States. Georgia and Ukraine are stuck in a bad neighborhood with
a belligerent big neighbor, and America can't change that.

Four points stand out. [First, though Ukraine has been badly treated by
Moscow, the issue matters not much for American and European
security.]{.underline} [Ukraine long was part of the Russian Empire (in
both old and new variants). **[Washington never]{.mark} [worried about
Kyiv]{.mark}**['s]{.mark} status [since]{.mark} **[Moscow was]{.mark}
the [key ]{.mark}**]{.underline}[p]{.mark}layer.

Ukraine is closer to Europe, which therefore should have a greater
interest in that nation's stability. The Europeans, however, recognize
that Russia's mistreatment of Ukraine --- seizing Crimea and backing
separatism in the Donbass in the east --- is sui generis. Putin has done
nothing to indicate he wants to try to swallow Ukraine, an impossible
task, and if he won't do that he isn't likely to launch a blitzkrieg to
overrun Europe (with three times Russia's population).

The main impact of [Moscow's Ukrainian
misadventure](https://spectator.org/ukraine-russia-united-states/) is
making Kyiv's membership in NATO unlikely, since present rules bar
admitting a country with active border disputes with a neighbor. But
that fits with European opposition to Ukraine's inclusion. Since the
conflict started in 2014, the more distant U.S., pushed by a curious
coalition of pro‐​war Republicans and anti‐​Trump Democrats, has been most
determined to confront Moscow.

[Second, [Putin]{.mark}'s government [doesn']{.mark}t [threaten the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. A direct attack on America is
inconceivable. As for the Europeans, even they, at least those not on
Russia's border, dismiss the likelihood of war:]{.underline} [[if they
were worried]{.mark}, [they would]{.mark} be [spendi]{.mark}ng
[more]{.mark} than 1 percent plus change [on]{.mark} their
[militaries]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a lot of sparring between
America and the Russian Federation in peripheral areas --- Syria, Cuba,
Venezuela, Libya --- but these are of marginal importance. And if
Washington did not treat Moscow as an enemy through sanctions and more,
the latter would be less likely to reciprocate by routinely challenging
U.S. interests. Russia's human rights situation is atrocious, but
murder, kidnapping, torture, mass imprisonment, and foreign aggression
don't bother American officials when conducted by Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Turkey, and more.

[Third, current [U.S. policy]{.mark} [is]{.mark} bizarrely [pushing
Moscow and Beijing]{.mark} [together]{.mark}. Richard Nixon transformed
the Cold War by engaging China and turning the geopolitical gap between
them from a ditch into a chasm.]{.underline} [Now Russia and the
People's Republic of China are working together against America.
S]{.underline}ome analysts seek to reassure by insisting that the two
will inevitably break up. Others counsel that nothing can be done to
prevent such cooperation.

Vladimir Putin has the world on edge. The [[Russia]{.mark}n president
[has deployed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders and
threatened "military]{.mark}-technical" [measures if NATO continues to
cooperate]{.mark} with Kyiv.]{.underline} He unilaterally drafted two
extraordinarily aggressive treaties in December designed to constrain
the organization and its members. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} contain
[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}s that are such nonstarters---most
centrally, [[closing NATO's open door to Ukraine]{.mark} and prohibiting
organizational forces and weapons in nations that joined after May
1997]{.underline}---that they read more like predicates for war rather
than sincere overtures for negotiations. Nonetheless, U.S. President Joe
[[Biden]{.mark} and NATO provided detailed written replies in January,
[attempting to start a dialogue with]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n
leader]{.underline}. If Putin spurns these offers, war is likely. But
[[Moscow has not]{.mark} yet wholly [rejected
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Conquering Ukraine would be no
cakewalk, and [Putin understands that killing thousands of
people]{.mark} from a nation he describes as "part of Russia" [would be
hard to explain to his citizens]{.mark}, especially if the Russian
military also suffers major casualties.]{.underline} Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the United States' response to the
initial proposal contained "a kernel of rationality," and [[Putin is
still speaking and meeting with Western leaders]{.underline}]{.mark},
including Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. [[If Putin does
agree to negotiate]{.mark}, then [Biden]{.mark} and his team [should not
just offer defensively minimal concessions to freeze the crisis]{.mark}.
[Instead,]{.mark} in concert with allies and partners, [Biden should
seize the diplomatic offensive and **counter with a comprehensive, grand
bargain for enhancing European security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Call it
"Helsinki 2.0." [This [agreement could refresh and modernize the
Helsinki Accords]{.mark} signed during the Cold War, [which stabilized
the continent]{.mark}]{.underline} even as U.S.-Soviet competition grew
in other parts of the world. [[It could resuscitate and amend defunct
arms control agreements and provide a bigger **framework for European
security**, and in the process help solve the issues surrounding
Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Convening a major summit to renegotiate
European security will give Russia an international platform that Putin
does not deserve. But that symbolism shouldn't stop Biden, NATO leaders,
and other European democracies. [The [Helsinki Accords recognized the
Soviet Union as a superpower,]{.mark} [and that affirmation helped
persuade Soviet]{.mark} leader Leonid Brezhnev to make
[concessions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin also likes attention, and the
West should be prepared to offer cheap pageantry not only to prevent a
new Russian invasion into Ukraine but also to repair Europe's broken
security architecture. [The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and
Europe [must]{.mark} have the courage to [move beyond defensive
patchwork fixes and instead pivot to bold, aggressive initiatives to
make the continent safer.]{.mark}]{.underline} On the surface, the 1970s
were not an auspicious time for Soviet-U.S. compromise. Many observers
believed the Kremlin's power was rising and Washington's was falling.
Communists were taking power in parts of southeast Asia and southern
Africa. Tension between the world's main blocs was running high. But in
the middle of the decade, Canadian, Soviet, U.S., and European diplomats
set aside their broad and fundamental disagreements to discuss an issue
of shared concern: European security. After several years of
negotiations, they produced and signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act,
which codified ambiguous issues left over from World War II. At the
heart of the accords was a central compromise: Western states de facto
recognized the borders that resulted from Soviet conquests after World
War II, and in return, the Soviet Union agreed to "respect human rights
and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience,
religion or beliefs, for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion, and joined the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) tasked with implementing these obligations.
The Soviet Union and the West also tacitly agreed to disagree on the
precise definitions of government accountability, human rights, economic
rights, and non-intervention in internal affairs . Ambiguity, they
showed, is sometimes necessary for effective diplomacy. In the first two
decades after the accords were signed, Europe saw an explosion of new
security agreements and treaties, particularly after Soviet reformer
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. In 1987, he joined U.S. President
Ronald Reagan to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty, eliminating a whole class of highly destabilizing weapons. In
1990, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty came online,
substantially reducing the size of conventional forces deployed on the
continent. The 1990 Vienna Document, signed by Canada, the Soviet Union,
the United States, and most of Europe and Central Asia, expanded
transparency about weapons and military training exercises. After the
Soviet Union collapsed, Russia and the West continued to make deals that
helped keep Europe secure. The 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which followed
the Vienna Document, allowed signatories to fly reconnaissance missions
through one another's territories to collect information on military
activities. The ambitious 1990 Charter of Paris trumpeted that all
European signatories would "build, consolidate and strengthen democracy
as the only system of government of our nations." It declared
prematurely that "the era of confrontation and division of Europe has
ended." The 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine
sent Kyiv's nuclear weapons to Russia in exchange for promises that
Moscow, the United Kingdom, and the United States would respect
Ukraine's territorial integrity. The 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act
established mechanisms for the two parties to collaborate, marking a
high point in cooperation.

[The Trump administration's antipathy toward arms control will strike
again on November 22, when the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[withdraws from]{.mark} the [Open Skies]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline}.
That is a mistake[. While Russia has violated the treaty, the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has reciprocated]{.mark}**. [NATO
allies support the treaty]{.mark} --- which focuses first and foremost
on [enhanc]{.mark}ing [European security]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
wish the United States to remain a party.

Whether the treaty can continue following the American departure remains
to be seen and will depend on what Russia does. When it takes office,
the Biden administration should consider reentering the agreement,
though that may require some creative international lawyering.

THE TREATY

The [[Open Skies]{.underline}]{.mark} Treaty, which entered into force
in 2002, [[permits countries to fly unarmed aircraft with
cameras]{.mark} and other sensors over the territory of the treaty's
other 34 members states.]{.underline} Based on an idea advanced by
Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, [Open Skies provides for the collection
of imagery of [military]{.mark} installations and activities in order to
**foster [transparency]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Each party to the treaty has two annual quotas: the number of flights
it may conduct over other treaty-parties (active quota), and the number
of overflights that it must accept (passive quota).]{.underline}
Aircraft are inspected before conducting an Open Skies flight, and
personnel from the country to be overflown are on board during the
flight.

The treaty offers several advantages. While the capabilities of U.S.
reconnaissance satellites are superior to those of Open Skies aircraft,
all 34 treaty-parties have access to imagery from the flights (whereas
satellite imagery is highly classified). [The treaty gives U.S. allies
and partners, who lack sophisticated imagery satellites, the opportunity
to gather confidence-building data.]{.underline} Moreover, [aircraft
offer **greater flexibility than satellites** in flight plans and can
fly under cloud cover. Open Skies flights can also be **used to send
political signals:** After Russia instigated the conflict in Donbas in
2014, for instance, the United States targeted flights at eastern
Ukraine and the bordering Russian territory in order to send a message
of U.S. support for Kyiv.]{.underline}

By 2019, the 34 parties had conducted a total of **[more than 1,500
overflights]{.underline}**. During the treaty's first 15 years of
operation, the United States conducted [196 flights over Russia and
Belarus (the two are paired for treaty purposes),]{.underline} [while
Russia conducted 71 flights over the United States.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [[Russia has violated]{.mark} the treaty [by imposing
restrictions]{.mark} on certain flights over its territory. In response,
the United States imposed reciprocal restrictions on Russian flights
over U.S. territory.]{.underline} While the Russian violations are
problematic, [[Washington has not declared]{.mark} that they constitute
a [material breach]{.mark} --- that is, a violation that vitiates the
central purpose of the treaty]{.underline}. Nevertheless, on May 21,
Secretary of State Pompeo released a statement saying that, unless
Moscow returned to full compliance, Washington would leave the treaty in
six months' time. The U.S. government provided formal notification of
its intention to withdraw to the other treaty parties the following day;
hence, the U.S. withdrawal will take effect on November 22.

A SERIAL KILLER OF ARMS CONTROL?

By all appearances, the Trump administration sees little value in arms
control and nonproliferation arrangements. In 2018, President Trump
decided to withdraw from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
that limited Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran can produce the fissile
material for a nuclear bomb in a much shorter time today than three
years ago. Meanwhile, the United States stands isolated, with close
allies such as Britain, France, and Germany staying in the agreement and
ignoring Washington's requests to apply sanctions on Tehran.

In 2019, [the Trump administration [withdrew from]{.mark} the 1987
[Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces]{.mark} Treaty, an agreement signed
by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev that banned an entire class of
missiles]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark} had
[violated]{.mark}]{.underline} the agreement by [[deploying **a**
prohibited missile]{.underline}]{.mark}, but President [[Trump]{.mark}'s
team showed **[no interest in preserving the
treaty]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [eschewing military and political
measures that [could have pressured Moscow]{.mark} to return to
compliance.]{.underline}

In 2020, administration officials reportedly considered conducting an
underground nuclear test. That would violate a long-standing test
moratorium observed by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and
France (the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would prohibit all
nuclear tests, has not entered into force). A U.S. nuclear test would
open the door to tests by others, eroding the nuclear knowledge
advantage the United States enjoys from having conducted more tests than
the rest of the world combined.

Happily, the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)
appears safe. True, the Trump administration could in its final days
give notice of an intention to withdraw, but the intention could only be
carried out three months later. President-elect Biden supports New START
and supports its extension; he would revoke any such notice.

However, Open Skies looks to be the outgoing Trump administration's next
--- and last --- victim.

WHAT NEXT FOR OPEN SKIES?

The Open Skies [[Treaty]{.mark} focused on [strengthen]{.mark}ing
[confidence and security]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}, one reason why
the Trump administration [[should have given]{.mark} the [views
of]{.mark} its [allies greater weight]{.mark}]{.underline}. A major
question now turns on what Moscow will do[, given that the U.S.
departure will mean that Russia can conduct flights over European
territory and Canada but not the United States]{.underline}.

[If Moscow decides to withdraw from Open Skies, perhaps citing the
[treaty's decreased value]{.mark} because it can no longer overfly
American territory, the treaty will collapse]{.underline}. [NATO allies
will see little point in overflying other allies or partners such as
Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. Alternatively, Moscow could decide to
remain in the treaty, at least for a time, in part to score propaganda
points over the U.S. withdrawal.

On 2 February, the latter released what it said was a leaked copy of a
US response to Russian demands, in which Washington offered talks with
Moscow on an agreement for both sides to refrain from stationing
offensive missiles or troops in Ukraine. The authenticity of the 11-page
leaked document has been confirmed.

On Thursday, US Ambassador John Sullivan received the Russian response
in Moscow, a senior State Department official said.

According to RIA Novosti, the main thrust of the Russian reply is as
follows:

creating benefits for Washington and its allies, [ignoring
the]{.underline} package **[nature of the proposals]{.underline}**,

Smith underscored that [the [U.S. and NATO]{.mark} position [was
two-track]{.mark}: to [pursue diplomacy by welcoming continued
dialogue]{.mark} with Russia; [and]{.mark} to [reinforce NATO
against]{.mark} potential [Russia]{.mark}n aggression]{.underline}.

The [U.S. has already unilaterally reinforced eastern flank
allies]{.underline} by sending 5,000 troops to Central and Eastern
Europe, including 3,000 Soldiers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division
to Poland and 1,000 from a U.S. Stryker squadron at Vilseck, Germany, to
Romania.

Stoltenberg said the U.S. additions are meaningful.

"I saw the Stryker units coming into Romania, coming into Constanta, and
there are more U.S. planes, there are more German, Italian, and other
allies \[who\] have also stepped up," he said.

In addition to troop movements, the U.S. Air Force has now sent eight
F-16s and 16 F-15s to the eastern flank.

Eight additional F-15s from the 336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter
Wing, at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., deployed to Lask Air
Base, Poland, on Feb. 14 to augment the eight F-15s already there from
the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, U.K., U.S. Air Forces in Europe
confirmed to Air Force Magazine. Eight F-16s from the 52nd Fighter Wing
at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, deployed to Fetesti Air Base, Romania,
on Feb. 11. The fighter jets in both locations will take part in NATO
enhanced air policing missions and joint training.

[[The U.S.]{.mark} also [maintains]{.mark} on [high alert]{.mark} an
additional 8,500 troops in the United States to act as a NATO Response
Force if called upon.]{.underline}

[[A NATO official]{.underline}]{.mark} from the eastern flank
[[told]{.underline}]{.mark} Air Force Magazine [[the alliance has "not
seen]{.mark} anything specific" with regard to [threats emanating from
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that hybrid activities, including
propaganda against border areas of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia,
continue.

A heavy Russian troop presence in Belarus, which borders the Baltic
countries, is also worrying because it has shrunk indications and
warning time.

The official said the Alliance is watching Russian activities closely to
see if actions match recent statements.

["I think **[everybody is waiting and watching with caution]{.mark}**
for those messages to be confirmed,"]{.underline} the official said.

A Feb. 14 move by the Russian lower house Duma to draft resolutions
recognizing the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, in southeast
Ukraine, as independent states also worries NATO.

"That would obviously be a new shift in in the escalation," Smith said,
adding that the recognition would violate Ukraine's territorial
integrity and break Russia's commitment to the Minsk protocol, which
reduced conflict in 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed
Crimea.

The NATO eastern flank official also cited the Duma resolutions as
concerning.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III was scheduled to leave Washington,
D.C. Feb. 15 to attend the Meeting of NATO Ministers of Defence,
scheduled for Feb. 15-16, before traveling on to Poland and Lithuania,
where he will meet with his counterparts and American troops. Before
leaving Brussels on Feb. 17, Austin and the other defense ministers of
the 30-member Alliance will meet with the defense ministers of aspiring
members Ukraine and Georgia.

**[[Putin]{.mark} has [made clear]{.mark} that [he does not want NATO to
expand eastward]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and [he]{.mark} has
specifically [called for barring Ukraine and Georgia]{.mark} from
entering the alliance. [NATO and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates have
[stood firm on the]{.mark} so-called NATO ["open-door policy"]{.mark}
that allows any country to pursue membership.]{.underline}

[Still, [**NATO leaders believe** there is a possibility of **averting a
Russian invasion.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[We believe [the best path is]{.mark} through [**dialogue and
de-escalation**.]{.mark} And [we have urged them]{.mark} at every turn
[to come back to the table,"]{.mark}]{.underline} Smith said of dialogue
with Russia. "[[We do not understand]{.mark} fundamentally, none of us
do, **[what is inside]{.mark} President [Putin's head.]{.mark}** And,
so, we cannot make any guess how, where all of this is

[[Tensions between Russia and]{.underline}]{.mark} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) **[have
[reached]{.mark} the point of [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
government of Russian President Vladimir [Putin is threatening a wider
military incursion into Ukraine unless the U.S.-led alliance makes
several major security concessions, including a commitment to cease
expanding eastward.]{.underline}

[[Russia says]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and NATO
have continually violated pledges]{.underline}]{.mark} allegedly made in
the early 1990s that the alliance would not expand into the former
Soviet bloc. Meanwhile, [**[alliance leaders]{.mark} have said they [are
open to new ]{.mark}**[diplomacy]{.mark} with Russia [on **arms
control**]{.mark} and other matters]{.underline} but that they are
unwilling to discuss forever shutting NATO's doors to new members.

What is the source of Russia's dispute with NATO?

[[Russian leaders have]{.mark} long [been wary of the]{.mark} eastward
[expansion of NATO]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly as the alliance
opened its doors to former Warsaw Pact states and ex-Soviet republics in
the late 1990s (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) and early 2000s
(Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia).
[Their fears grew in the late 2000s as the alliance stated its intent to
admit Georgia and Ukraine]{.underline} at an unspecified point in the
future.

For the Kremlin, [the notion that Ukraine]{.underline}, a pillar of the
Soviet Union with strong historic ties to Russia, [would join NATO was a
red line]{.underline}. [**["No Russian leader could stand idly]{.mark}**
by in the face of steps [**toward NATO membership** for
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[That would be a hostile act toward
Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}**" Putin warned U.S.
Undersecretary for Political Affairs William J. Burns, who is now
director of the CIA, in the weeks leading up to NATO's 2008 Bucharest
Summit.

Although NATO did not announce a formal membership plan for Ukraine and
Georgia at the Bucharest Summit, the alliance did affirm "that these
countries will become members of NATO," and it extended formal
invitations to accession talks to Albania and Croatia, which became
members in 2009. NATO expanded again in 2017, admitting Montenegro, and
in 2020, welcoming North Macedonia.

Did the United States promise the Soviet Union that it would freeze NATO
expansion?

[Russian officials say that [the U.S]{.mark}. government [made a pledge
to Soviet leaders not to expand the alliance's eastern
borders]{.mark}]{.underline}, a commitment they say came **[[during the
flurry of diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** following the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989 and surrounding the reunification of Germany in
1990. Proponents of this narrative often cite the words that U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker said to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in February 1990, that "there would be no extension of NATO's
jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east." They say **[[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and NATO]{.mark} have [repeatedly
betrayed this verbal commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the decades
since, [**[taking advantage of Russia's]{.underline}** [tumultuous
post-Soviet period]{.underline}]{.mark} [and expanding the Western
alliance several times, all the way to Russia's doorstep in]{.underline}
the case of [the Baltic states.]{.underline}

However, many Western analysts and former U.S. officials involved in
these discussions dispute what they say is a selective view of history.
They point out that, in early 1990, the focus of the diplomacy between
the so-called Two Plus Four (East and West Germany plus the United
States, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom) was the future
of Germany and the question of whether the soon-to-be unified country
would be part of NATO. (West Germany was already an alliance member,
while East Germany was part of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact.) They say
that the discussions were not about NATO's long-term plans for eastward
expansion, which would have made little sense at that time; the Warsaw
Pact and the Soviet Union still existed, and there was scant indication
they would dissolve as quickly as they did, in a matter of months. In a
2014 interview, Gorbachev said as much: "The topic of 'NATO expansion'
was never discussed. It was not raised in those years."

[**[The diplomacy between U.S. and Soviet leaders]{.underline}** [during
this period focused on Germany and included discussions
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [various [post-unification security
options]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the potential for Germany to
become part of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, for Germany to be
nonaligned, and even for the Soviet Union to join NATO. Early in the
talks, Soviet leaders insisted that a unified Germany never become part
of NATO, though they eventually accepted Germany's right to decide for
itself. Similarly, the United States stepped back from Baker's initial
language on not expanding "NATO's jurisdiction," which he reportedly
used only in the discussion about whether NATO troops would be based in
what was then East Germany. In the end, the treaty recognizing German
unification that the Two Plus Four powers signed in the summer of 1990
stipulated that only German territorial (non-NATO) forces could be based
in East Germany while Soviet forces withdrew. After that, only German
forces assigned to NATO could be based there, not foreign NATO forces.
The treaty doesn't mention NATO's rights and commitments beyond Germany.

[[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} defense ministers from across the alliance
arrived in Brussels on Feb. 15 [[eager to verify Russian claims that it
is]{.mark} withdrawing forces and **[open to a diplomatic
solution]{.mark}** to end the Russia-Ukraine crisis,]{.underline} even
as tens of thousands of Russian troops remained on Baltic borders.

With more than 130,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine on three sides
and a continuous buildup of military equipment, Russian President
Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} appeared [to change course]{.mark}]{.underline}
Feb. 14. In a televised exchange with Putin, [Russian Foreign
Minister]{.underline} Sergey [[Lavrov **suggested a diplomatic solution
was still possible.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Meanwhile, the Russian
Ministry of Defense announced Feb. 15 that some units had completed
their tasks and were returning to their military garrisons.

**[[But NATO is hesitant to take Putin at his
word]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"What we need to see is a significant and enduring withdrawal of forces,
troops, and not least \[of which\] the heavy equipment," NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a pre-ministerial press
briefing Feb. 15, in response to a question about Lavrov's comments a
day earlier.

"[So far, [we have not seen any de-escalation]{.mark} on the ground from
the Russian side. Over the last weeks and days, [we have seen the
opposite]{.mark}]{.underline}," Stoltenberg added. "A continued military
buildup with more troops, more battlegroups, more high-end capabilities,
artillery, air defense missiles, and a lot of support elements that
makes it possible for Russia to move into Ukraine for full-fledged
invasion or a more limited military incursion with hardly any warning
time at all."

However, [Stoltenberg said [there is]{.mark} **"some ground for
[cautious optimism"]{.mark}** based on the signaling from
Moscow.]{.underline}

[[A Russian]{.mark} Ministry of Defence [article]{.mark}]{.underline}
Feb. 15 describing joint exercises with Belarus and planned live fire
exercises Feb. 19, also [[mentioned]{.mark} that some [troops were
**preparing to return.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[The units]{.underline} of the Southern and Western military districts,
having completed their tasks, [have already begun loading onto rail and
road transport and will begin moving to their military garrisons
today]{.underline}," the story read.

[U.S. permanent representative to NATO]{.underline}, Ambassador Julianne
[[Smith, told]{.underline}]{.mark} reporters early Feb. 15 [**that [she
was hopeful for a diplomatic solution]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} that
[claims of a drawdown]{.mark} by Russia **[must be
verified.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[This is something that [we'll have to look]{.mark} at [closely and
verify]{.mark} in the days ahead,"]{.underline} Smith said during a
teleconference from Brussels, noting that Russia made a similar claim in
late December.

"[What's important is that we try to [verify based on]{.mark} the fact
[that **we've seen other instances**]{.mark} **in the past** [where
Russia]{.mark} has [claimed to be de-escalating, and]{.mark} in fact,
facts on the ground **[didn't prove]{.mark} that [to be]{.mark}
true,"**]{.underline} she added.

After the comments, [reports emerged that [Ukraine]{.mark}'s defense
ministry and two banks [came under cyberattack]{.mark}. Defense
officials have of late voiced concerns that Russia would commence any
conflict]{.underline} with cyber, informational, and hybrid warfare
tactics.

Meanwhile, the ranking [members]{.underline} of House committees for
Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence [introduced a bill to
sanction Russia now instead of threatening sanctions should Putin order
an invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine. [The bill cites Russia's military
buildup and the hybrid warfare tactics already committed]{.underline}
against Ukraine, [and calls for additional support]{.underline} to
Ukraine and allies on NATO's eastern flank.

Crisis [[instability]{.mark} over Ukraine [is playing ou]{.mark}t during

[eroding]{.mark} strategic [stability in the nuclear deterrent]{.mark}

[Russia]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} confluence [threatens]{.mark} to recast
and elevate two traditional [dangers of]{.mark} the bipolar [Cold War
era]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Throughout the nuclear age, the U.S. strategy of deterrence has aimed to
keep low a low probability event with high consequences. While the
probability of Russian nuclear use remains low, the Ukraine War has
elevated this risk to a level not seen since the most fraught moments of
the Cold War. As Putin warns that any Western interference in Ukraine
will be met with a "[lightning
fast](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/putin-warns-of-lightning-fast-retaliation-to-foreign-intervention-in-ukraine-138812997985)"
response from Russia, the crisis contains the risk of escalation---such
as a geographical spillover of the conflict beyond Ukraine's borders.

[[Crisis stability]{.mark} [and strategic stability]{.mark} [are
linked]{.mark}: strategic stability has been defined by U.S.
administrations as the absence of incentives to use nuclear weapons
first in a crisis. [With]{.mark} the [near-total collapse]{.mark} of the
arms-control architecture [from]{.mark} the [last fifty years]{.mark},
the [two]{.mark} great [powers are]{.mark} now [locked in]{.mark} an
unconstrained [arms race]{.mark}---[through]{.mark} their [nuclear
modernization]{.mark} programs (including the development [of]{.mark} a
[new generation]{.mark} of strategic nuclear systems, tactical nuclear
weapons, and [hypersonic
missiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/us/politics/russia-hypersonic-missile-attack-claim.html)),
[as well as]{.mark} the extension of their [competition into]{.mark} the
emergent domains of [cyberspace and outer space]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The first danger]{.mark} of the Cold War being recast and elevated [in
this]{.mark} emerging strategic [environment is]{.mark} the
[relationship between]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence and]{.mark} the
[possibility for conflic]{.mark}t at lower levels on the continuum of
military forc]{.underline}e. After both the United States and the Soviet
Union acquired thermonuclear weapons in the early 1950s, British
strategist B.H. Liddell Hart speculated, "To the extent that the H-bomb
reduces the likelihood of full-scale war, it increases the possibility
of limited war pursued by widespread local [aggression." Policy analysts
would later refer to this as the "[stability-instability
paradox](https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/402911/the-stability-instability-paradox/)"---that
[strategic stability]{.mark} at the nuclear level [could
generate]{.mark} [instability by]{.mark} [encouraging]{.mark} rival
[powers to pursue]{.mark} tactical [gains through]{.mark} [non-nuclear
means]{.mark} in regions peripheral to the central conflict]{.underline}
in what was then called the "Third World."

But even with the ideological overlay of the Cold War, these stakes were
less than vital and the conflicts typically involved one superpower
against the proxy forces of the other (e.g., Soviet backing of the North
during the Vietnam War, U.S. support for the Afghan Mujahedeen by the
Carter and Reagan administrations). These constraints significantly
mitigated the risks of escalation. By contrast, the potential
flashpoints between the United States and Russia are not peripheral
but vital interests.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has reset the debate over Vladimir Putin's
revanchist intentions. The scale of the Russian invasion---and the
Russian dictator's initial objective of regime change in
Kyiv---accompanied by nuclear saber-rattling is unprecedented and,
forebodingly, without geographical limits. The Kremlin has asserted a
right to "protect" ethnic Russians and Russian speakers beyond Russia's
borders (which it says numbers some 25 million people) and has even
offered citizenship to millions of ethnic Russians living in neighboring
former Soviet republics, including the three Baltic states that are NATO
members

[[The]{.mark} second [revived danger]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [Cold War
era]{.mark} [are threats to]{.mark} the [stability of]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} RAND Corporation strategist
Albert Wohlstetter challenged the assumption of an inherently stable
nuclear deterrent in a 1959 Foreign Affairs article, "The Delicate
Balance ofTerror." Wohlstetter's concern then was the vulnerability of
U.S. nuclear forces to surprise attack and that in a crisis the Kremlin
leadership might perceive an incentive to go first---to launch a
preemptive strike. This dynamic led to the Cuban Missile Crisis. [The
Soviet [deployment of]{.mark} medium-range ballistic [missiles]{.mark}
[on Cuba to target]{.mark} the [U.S]{.mark}. East coast [was a]{.mark}
[desperate bid to]{.mark} [redress]{.mark} the strategic [balance
with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
p]{.mark}recipitated the most [dangerous crisis]{.mark} [of the Cold
War]{.mark}. After the profound shock of that near Armageddon, the
Soviet Union began to match the U.S. deployment of large numbers of
secure second-strike nuclear forces. The crisis highlighted the
potentially catastrophic consequences of a "delicate" balance that
incentivized one side to go first.]{.underline}

Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, assured retaliation---eliminating
incentives for a surprise first strike---has been the sine qua non of
strategic stability[. The [risk for crisis stability]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
that [arms]{.mark} race i[nstability]{.mark} could revive those
incentives, making the deterrent relationships more "delicate."
[With]{.mark} the advent of [new technologies]{.mark}, escalation during
a crisis could occur in a non-traditional domain---[cyber or
space]{.mark}---and [could]{.mark} [misleadingly]{.mark} [be
viewed]{.mark} [as non-escalatory]{.mark} because it would be
non-kinetic. But an inadvertent [escalatory spiral]{.mark}
[could]{.mark} [be set off by]{.mark} a Russian [cyberattack]{.mark} [to
interfere with]{.mark} U.S. [communications]{.mark} with its nuclear
systems or an attack on reconnaissance satellites to blind the United
State]{.underline}s. Hints of that potentiality are already manifest:
Russia conducted an [anti-satellite missile
test](https://www.space.com/crussian-anti-satellite-missile-test-world-condemnation) last
November and, during the Ukraine war, has carried out
extensive [cyberattacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/us/politics/russia-cyberattacks-ukraine.html),
often in coordination with its battlefield operations.

In the Ukraine war, as during the Cuban Missile Crisis, inadvertent
escalation remains a major risk. [[Putin is a]{.mark}
[risk-taker]{.mark} (whose agents used a military-grade nerve agent in a
2018 assassination attempt on a Russian military defector in Britain)
[and]{.mark} he [is prone]{.mark} [to
miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. His assumptions going in to
Ukraine---that the conflict would be short and decisive, that the
Zelensky government would fold quickly, and that the West would be
feckless in its disunity---were all miscalculations that ironically led
many Western officials and analysts to conclude that he would threaten
but not invade.

[Given [Putin's]{.mark} [propensity for]{.mark} [risk-taking]{.mark}
[and miscalc]{.mark}ulation, the Biden administration [is
exploring]{.mark} [scenarios in]{.mark} [which Russian]{.mark} military
"[setbacks"]{.mark} and "desperation" (as CIA Director Burns' warned)
[lead to]{.mark} the [use of]{.mark} chemical or [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}. Under what U.S. officials describe as Russia's
"escalate-to-deescalate" strategy, Putin might double down in the face
of adversity by employing a single weapon for its demonstration
effect]{.underline}---to shock the Ukrainian and Western leaderships
into acceding to terms favorable to the Kremlin. While the Biden
administration has not laid down an explicit deterrent marker specifying
the U.S. response, a senior official warned that any Russian use of
nuclear weapons would mean "[all bets are
off](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/biden-russia-nuclear-weapons.html)"---a
tacit signal that such a violation of the nuclear taboo could move the
United States and NATO to become directly involved in the war. The Biden
administration could strengthen that deterrent message, as Stanford
Professor of Political Science [Scott
Sagan](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/04/20/u-s-must-can-prevent-russian-military-crossing-nuclear-threshold/#:~:text=Stanford%20scholar%20Scott%20Sagan%20found,of%20civilians%20in%20another%20country) has
recommended, by communicating directly to the Russian military that an
order from Putin to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine would be illegal, a
violation of the Geneva Conventions, and should not be obeyed.

### Impact\-\--Ext

#### **US-Russian relations solve a litany of impacts -- cooperation will be geographically and politically strategic**

**Einhorn '16** \[Robert; 02/26/2016; Master's in public affairs and
international relations from Princeton University, former State special
advisor for nonproliferation and arms control; \"Prospects for
U.S.-Russian nonproliferation cooperation,\" Brookings,

smarx, AZG\]

As long as overall bilateral relations remain in their current
adversarial condition, the opportunities for productive cooperation on
nonproliferation issues will be limited. But given the stake that both
governments share in preventing proliferation and the responsibility
they have as leaders of the global nonproliferation regime, it is
important that they [[look for areas where they could work
together]{.mark} to promote common goals.]{.underline}

• **[Dialogue.]{.underline}** With the demise of the U.S.-Russia
Bilateral Presidential Commission in the wake of Russian actions in
Ukraine, bilateral interactions on arms control and nonproliferation
issues have been limited and focused on immediate matters of concern,
such as Russia's violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty. Under current conditions, resurrecting wide-ranging,
senior-level forums such as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission in the
1990s is not realistic. However, **[the two sides should hold periodic
meetings]{.underline}**---led at the undersecretary or assistant
secretary level and supported by interagency teams---[to
[discuss]{.mark} a range of [nonprolif]{.mark}eration issues, compare
notes on the prospects for proliferation in various regions of the
world, and explore possible areas of common ground.]{.underline}

• **[[Combat]{.mark}ing [nuclear terrorism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia are founders]{.mark} and
co-chairs [of the]{.mark} Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism,
a]{.underline} voluntary, [[multilateral partnership]{.mark} of 86
countries dedicated to strengthening the capacity of its members [to
prevent]{.mark}, detect, and respond to]{.underline} acts of [[nuclear
terrorism.]{.underline}]{.mark} It [has sponsored more than 70
multilateral activities]{.underline} in such areas as nuclear detection,
forensics, and response and mitigation. [Despite the downturn in
bilateral relations]{.underline} and the termination of most bilateral
nuclear security programs, [the [Russia]{.mark}ns have been **[eager to
continue]{.mark} the initiative,**]{.underline} in part [because of the
co-leadership role]{.underline} they play in it. Especially [given
continuing concerns about terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons and
other WMDs]{.underline}, [[this remains a **promising area of bilateral
cooperation**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

• **[[Iran.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Russia will play a **crucial role**
in implementing the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}, including by
[accepting regular shipments of Iranian enriched uranium]{.underline}
and leading the conversion of the Fordow uranium enrichment facility
into a nuclear research center. **[[Russia is Iran's closest
friend]{.underline}]{.mark}** among the P5+1; as such, [its
cooperation]{.underline} with other P5+1 partners [in insisting on
strict enforcement of the agreement will be essential to convince Tehran
to comply.]{.underline} While much U.S.-Russian interaction on Iran will
take place in multilateral bodies, such as [the agreement's Joint
Commission, the United States and Russia, as **leading stakeholders**,
should also consult bilaterally.]{.underline}

• **[North Korea]{.underline}**. [In light of recent
nuclear]{.underline} and [missile tests and Kim Jong-un's apparent
intention to continue strengthening]{.underline} DPRK [strategic
capabilities,]{.underline} [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [will **occupy
a higher place** on **the**]{.mark} **international
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the period
ahead. While [Russia]{.underline} does not feel as directly threatened
as the United States, it [is surely concerned by North Korean
actions]{.underline}, not least because the actions could trigger a U.S.
response that Moscow doesn't like (as evidenced by its criticism of a
possible deployment of a U.S. antiballistic missile system, THAAD, in
South Korea). Although Russia is a less important player on North Korea
than China, it is probably less protective of the Kim regime than is
Beijing and may be more receptive to increasing pressure on Pyongyang.
[The United States should **explore options with Russia** for addressing
the North Korean threat.]{.underline}

• **[[Chemical weapons in Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although Russian
cooperation on Syrian chemical weapon issues has diminished since the
elimination of the 1,300 tons of chemical weapon agents, [[the
Russians]{.mark} apparently continue to [accept]{.mark} some
[responsibility]{.mark} for the fate of the U.S.-Russian
initiative]{.underline}. They have dragged their feet on calls for
investigations, but have eventually come around. [Washington should
press them to see this process through]{.underline}, especially [to
ensure that **Syria eliminates its entire chemical weapon
capability**]{.underline} and stops using chlorine or any other chemical
agent. And the [**two governments should cooperate** in]{.underline}
investigating and [stopping the Islamic State's use of mustard
agent.]{.underline}

• **[Civil [nuclear coop]{.mark}eration [with third
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While the nonproliferation commitments
the United States asks its nuclear cooperation partners to accept are
required by law and are a matter of public record, [the commitments
Russia seeks from its partners]{.underline}---aside from what Russia is
required to seek as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group---[are not
publicly known]{.underline}. The [United States and Russia **should
[consult]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the question of conditions of [nuclear
supply]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [addressing]{.underline}]{.mark} such
issues as whether [[supplier consent]{.underline}]{.mark} should be
required [[for uranium]{.mark} enrichment [and plutonium]{.mark}
reprocessing]{.underline} and the disposition of spent reactor fuel.
While the competitive commercial environment may limit what would be
discussed, and there is little prospect of arriving at common conditions
of supply, such **[consultations could usefully explore]{.underline}**
[how to **[minimize]{.mark} the likelihood** that nuclear cooperation
with third countries **will lead to
[prolif]{.mark}eration.**]{.underline}

• **[[Nuclear materials security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
Russia's termination of nuclear security programs and the U.S.
Congress's funding cutoff have ended most cooperation, some **[joint
work may be salvageable]{.underline}** [and could at least keep alive
the possibility of additional cooperation]{.underline} in the future.
For example, cooperation in repatriating HEU-bearing fuels to Russia
from Poland and Kazakhstan can continue. Further joint studies of
converting Russian HEU-fueled research reactors to operate on
low-enriched uranium fuels may also be possible. [The two
sides]{.underline} also [need to discuss]{.underline} the long-delayed
implementation of the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition
Agreement under which each side has agreed [to dispose]{.underline}
permanently of 34 metric tons of weapons-usable [plutonium.]{.underline}

In the current environment, bilateral cooperation will not be easy. But
given the importance to the global nonproliferation regime of the United
States and Russia playing leading roles, [it is **essential** that the
two governments **do what they can** to preserve the cooperation that
exists and seek to build on it wherever possible.]{.underline}

#### US-Russia arms racing goes nuclear\-\-- new threats over Ukraine and empirical relations US-Soviet

at Newsweek, "Ukraine Conflict Risks New U.S.-Russia Arms Race, World
Closer to Nuclear War,"

[The thunderous [eruption of]{.mark} Europe\'s worst [war]{.mark} in

between]{.mark} the world\'s top two nuclear powers, [Russia and
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,]{.underline} [[with]{.mark}
[**nuclear threats** being discussed]{.mark} as never before in the 21st
century only days into the conflict in Ukraine.]{.underline}

[What comes next, experts and insiders fear, is an acceleration of the
Cold War-era arms race that never truly ended]{.underline} and soon may
enter a new, even more dangerous phase.

[\"I am [deeply concerned]{.mark} [we have]{.mark} [arrived at]{.mark}
the [most dangerous]{.mark} [moment in]{.mark} our collective [nuclear
history]{.mark} since the Cuban Missile Crisis,\"]{.underline} Joan
Rohlfing, president and chief operating officer of the Nuclear Threat
Initiative, told Newsweek. In fact she said, \"this is probably a moment
as dangerous as the Cuban Missile Crisis.\"

In the 75 years since the U.S. introduced the world to atomic warfare in
the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [the [**standoff** between U.S.
and Soviet]{.mark} [warship]{.mark}s in the Caribbean more than half a
century ago still [marks]{.mark} one of the most [fraught
moments]{.mark} [in **nuclear history**]{.mark}, [bringing]{.mark} the
[two superpowers]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the brink of [unleashing their
w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}
against one another.

[Rohlfing has a long career of seeking to rein in the threat of nuclear
war. Before joining the Nuclear Threat Initiative and participating in
leading projects such as the establishment of the World Institute for
Nuclear Security and Nuclear Security Project, Rohlfing served in senior
positions at the Department of Energy and
the [Pentagon](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pentagon).]{.underline}

And now, in response to Russian President [Vladimir
Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)\'s recent decision
to raise the readiness level of his nation\'s nuclear triad amid
deteriorating ties with the U.S. and
its [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) allies, she spells out
explicitly why she\'s concerned in this moment in history.

[\"[We are at]{.mark} a [significantly]{.mark} **[escalated
risk]{.mark}** [of nuclear use]{.mark},\" Rohlfing said.]{.underline}

[As the conflict in Ukraine marks Europe\'s worst war in decades[,
nuclear threats]{.mark} are being discussed as never before [in
the]{.mark} [21st century]{.mark}, [worrying experts]{.mark} and
insiders [of]{.mark} an acceleration of the [**Cold War-era**
arm]{.mark}s race [between the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Russia]{.mark}. Above, Russian personnel stand at attention as the
armed forces prepare to move nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic
missiles to Moscow for a victory parade]{.underline} in this still from
a video published February 25, a day after Russian President Vladimir
Putin ordered the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.RUSSIAN
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE

President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden) has
sought to downplay the likelihood of mounting U.S.-Russia tensions
culminating in a nuclear exchange. Asked by a reporter Monday if the
U.S. should be concerned about the possibility of a nuclear war, the
president simply responded, \"No.\"

But [recent [reports o]{.mark}f a new [U.S.-Russia]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} hotline [opened]{.mark} in Europe indicate a
[growing]{.mark} worry of the potential for direct [clashes]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the two [powers,]{.mark} [by]{.mark} design or
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation,]{.underline} as both seek to flex their
strategic deterrence.

[Matching Russia\'s own nuclear actions, the [U.S. has flown]{.mark}
**[nuclear-capable]{.mark}** B-52 [bombers to]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}\'s
eastern flank, a region that has been at the center of the Kremlin\'s
enmity toward the West due to the alliance\'s expansion since the fall
of the Soviet Union 30 years ago]{.underline}. Putin, who has been in
power for two of those past three decades, has also overseen the
collapse of the arms control architecture painstakingly, sometimes
begrudgingly, built by Washington and Moscow throughout the Cold War.

[First, the [U.S. pulled out of]{.mark} the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty [(ABM]{.mark}) in 2002, early on in Putin\'s tenure and shortly
after the 9/11 attacks pivoted Washington\'s attention away from
[rebuilding U.S.-Russia]{.mark} [relations]{.mark} toward fighting the
\"War on Terror\" that continues to this day.]{.underline} Five years
later, Moscow withdrew from the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
Treaty (CFE), arguing that the level of restrictions imposed on Russia
no longer made sense in the wake of the USSR-aligned Warsaw Pact\'s
dissolution.

[[The most]{.mark} [recent casualty]{.mark} to non-proliferation efforts
[was]{.mark} the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
([INF]{.mark}), scrapped [by]{.mark} former President [Donald
[Trump]{.mark}](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump) in 2019
[after longstanding]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} [accusations that
Russia]{.mark} [had]{.mark} violated the accord with the production of a
new missile]{.underline} that breached the 500-5,500-kilometer ban on
ground-based weapons systems.

Russia, for its part, argued that the U.S. was already in violation of
the INF with the deployment in Eastern Europe of missile defense systems
that Moscow has argued could not only neutralize the country\'s own
firepower but also be fitted with offensive weapons. The INF\'s looming
death only further pushed Putin to pursue the development of new
nuclear-capable platforms he touted as \"invincible\" to existing and
even prospective defenses.

[\"They didn\'t listen to us, so listen to us now,\" Putin proclaimed
during his 2018 unveiling of nuclear-capable systems such as the RS-28
Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, the Avangard hypersonic
boost-glide vehicle, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic air-launched
ballistic missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-power cruise missile
and, perhaps the biggest game-changer of them all,]{.underline} the
Poseidon unmanned underwater torpedo, a weapon believed capable of
producing fiery, radioactive waves across a radius of thousands of
square miles.

[The [U.S.]{.mark} has largely [dismissed Russia\'s]{.mark} stated
[concerns]{.mark}, arguing that NATO was solely a \"defensive\"
alliance, so the continued pursuit of Washington and its allies of
state-of-the-art weapons of their own [and]{.mark} even the [continued
**deployment**]{.mark} [o]{.mark}f U.S. **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}** in
Europe, meant no offense to Moscow.]{.underline}

But just as the Kremlin watched with wariness at NATO\'s physical
expansion, so too has Russia witnessed a historic rival coalition
broaden its military mandate to include intervention in the Balkans and
Libya. And after unrest first broke out in Ukraine eight years ago with
the ousting of a Moscow-aligned government for one seeking to join the
Western alliance, here too NATO took a larger role in arming and
training Kyiv\'s security forces against a Moscow-backed separatist
insurgency as Russia moved to annex the Crimean Peninsula amid an
internationally disputed referendum.

While Rohlfing emphasized that the U.S. and NATO\'s past actions in no
way justified Putin\'s intervention last week, she acknowledged a need
to reflect on how we arrived at this low point with Moscow.

\"At some point when we get out of this crisis, we\'re going to need to
go back and take a careful look at how could we have done better in
listening more closely to Russian concerns and addressing them rather
than continuing to take actions that they perceived to be a threat to
their security interests,\" Rohlfing said.

Michael Krepon, who co-founded the Stimson Center think tank and
previously served in the State Department\'s Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency during the administration of former U.S.
President [Jimmy Carter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/jimmy-carter),
also saw missteps in the U.S. approach to European security after the
fall of the Soviet Union, errors he felt were now hard to correct.

[\"[Open-ended]{.mark} NATO [expansion was]{.mark}, in my view, an
[error in]{.mark} j[udgment]{.mark}, but once this door was opened, it
was hard to close,\" Krepon told Newsweek.]{.underline}

#### Western influence in Europe threatens Russian forces and causes miscalc---leads to nuclear annihilation 

**Scientific American, 6-1** (Scientific American, 6-1-22, "To Prevent
Nuclear Annihilation, Resume Negotiations Immediately,"
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-prevent-nuclear-annihilation-resume-negotiations-immediately/>)

["[It is]{.mark} either [the end of **nuclear weapons**, o]{.mark}r the

Prize in an open letter in March that has since
been [signed](https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/no_nuclear_war_loc/) by
more than a million people. Decades after the end of the cold war and
mere months after the U.S., Russia and other members of the United
Nations Security Council agreed that "a nuclear war cannot be won and
must never be fought," the specter of nuclear apocalypse again looms
over humankind.

[[Western]{.mark}]{.underline} powers contemplating
[**i[ntervention]{.mark}** in the war in Ukraine "[must know]{.mark}
that [Russia will]{.mark} [respond

[more than 90]{.mark} [million people]{.mark} within a few

[extreme]{.mark} level of [distrust]{.mark} between the adversaries
[makes it hard for]{.mark} [them to negotiate]{.mark}; nevertheless,
they must urgently strive to reduce the nuclear threat.]{.underline}

The crisis in Ukraine could provide an impetus. In 1962 the U.S. and the
Soviet Union narrowly averted nuclear war over the deployment of nuclear
missiles in Cuba. The terrifyingly close call sparked an era of arms
control. Ten years later the U.S. and the Soviet Union signed the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, constraining the development of
defensive shields against incoming missiles, and also agreed to limit
the numbers of intercontinental and other ballistic missiles. Another
agreement in 1987 banned intermediate-range nuclear weapons, and the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) of 1991 forced significant
reductions in U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals. These treaties created
"guardrails," says Daryl Kimball of the [Arms Control
Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/), without which "one side or
the other could go over the nuclear cliff."

[The doctrine of mutually assured destruction, or [**MAD,** held]{.mark}
that [neither superpower could]{.mark} [initiate]{.mark} an
[attack]{.mark} without itself facing annihilation[. But]{.mark} in
[2002 t]{.mark}he U[.S. withdrew from]{.mark} the **[ABM]{.mark}**
Treaty [and]{.mark} [began to
build](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-cant-count-on-missile-defense-to-defeat-incoming-nukes/) a
missile **defense system**, destabilizing this uneasy balance and
sparking a new arms race. In [2019]{.mark} then president Donald
[Trump]{.mark} went further, [abandoni]{.mark}ng the [Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces]{.mark} [Treaty.]{.mark}]{.underline}

These eliminations leave the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New
START, negotiated by former presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev
in 2010, as the only constraint on the numbers of strategic nuclear
weapons. [[Negotiation]{.mark}s for renewing and possibly expanding the
agreement were scheduled to begin this year; these talks [have]{.mark}
now [been suspended]{.mark}. But if New START is allowed to lapse, a new

Russia]{.mark} could [not agree to a follow-on treaty to the New START
treaty]{.mark} before it expires in 2026, [and]{.mark} the [NPT
review]{.mark} conference tentatively scheduled for August 2022 [would
fall]{.mark} by the [wayside]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As a consequence,
the incipient [arms race]{.mark} now underway, [fueled by new
tech]{.mark}nologies---[hypersonics, cyber tools]{.mark}, and
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence---[would
accelerate.]{.mark}]{.underline} A [[new wave of nuc]{.mark}lear
[prolif]{.mark}eration could [ensue]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially if
U.S. allies and partners lose faith in America's commitment to extended
deterrence. [[Mutually assured destruction]{.mark}, which for better or
worse has anchored strategic stability since the early 1970s, [would be
severely stressed in a multipolar nuclear landscape]{.mark} with Russia
and the United States fighting at least a proxy war.]{.underline}
Likewise, a [[broader conflict in Europe would]{.mark} stress, perhaps
to the [break]{.mark}ing point, the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[N]{.mark}**ations [and]{.mark} many of its [auxiliary]{.mark}
[organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Already stymied by a growing rift
between]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}ern permanent members [and Russia and
China]{.mark}, the [Security Council]{.mark} would have [failed]{.mark}
in [its]{.mark} primary [reason for being]{.mark}---to prevent the
outbreak of a major conflict in Europe.]{.underline} It could continue
to exist as a forum for the airing of grievances and acrimonious debate,
but it would serve little purpose as a platform for addressing major
global issues. Finally, the [[humanitarian costs]{.mark} of a wider
conflict in Europe [would be staggering]{.mark}, particularly [given the
destructiveness of modern weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beyond the
physical destruction and loss of life, untold numbers of refugees would
flow across borders not only into Central East Europe but perhaps
further West depending on the scale of the fighting. The strain on the
socioeconomic systems---coming on top of the stress of the two-year-old
pandemic, economic dislocation, and mounting inflation---could bring
some close to collapse.

The ongoing major Russian military buildup around [[Ukraine creates the
**potential for a catastrophic war** that]{.underline}]{.mark} can and
[[must be avoided through]{.underline}]{.mark} serious and deft
[[diplomacy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Among the many factors that have led us to this point is **[the
breakdown]{.underline}** [of important conventional and nuclear [arms
control]{.mark} agreements that helped **bring an end** to the first
Cold War. These **crucial [guardrails]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
including the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the Open Skies
Treaty, the ABM Treaty, and the INF Treaty, [are [no longer in
effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, [trust]{.underline} in each
others' intentions [has eroded, concerns about military capabilities
have grown, and **the risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation [is
high]{.mark}er.**]{.underline}

We are working hard to emphasize how and why [[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n
leaders [should]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[elevate action on diplomacy and
arms control]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [help **[defuse the
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} through their "Strategic Security
Dialogue," and why, [given the risks that nuclear weapons
pose]{.underline}, [a direct confrontation between the U.S./NATO and
Russia should be avoided.]{.underline}

Although Russia's written proposals on certain issues, such as
guarantees against further NATO expansion, are "non-starters" for U.S.
and NATO leaders, on other issues, [there are [proposals]{.mark} to
address mutual concerns about military capabilities that [provide a
**basis for talks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the credit of the Biden
administration, [[Washington's]{.mark} written [responses are
**serious**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} they [show there is
**room for negotiations**]{.mark} designed to resolve mutual security
concerns.]{.underline}

In particular, we believe [U.S. and Russian leaders **can and should
negotiate** new agreements to scale back large military exercises,
[avoid]{.mark} close military [encounters between Russia]{.mark}n [and
NATO]{.mark} forces, [and prevent]{.mark} the deployment of]{.underline}
intermediate-range [[missiles in Europe or]{.mark} Western
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In collaboration with experts in Russia, Europe, and the United States,
we are also pointing out that [Biden and Putin cannot afford to lose
sight of the need to conclude new agreements to further slash
their]{.underline} bloated strategic and nonstrategic [nuclear
forces]{.underline} and set limits on long-range missile defenses by
2025 and before New START expires in early 2026.
[Otherwise]{.underline}, [[the next showdown]{.mark} between Russia and
the West [will be]{.mark} **even [riskier.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In the nuclear age, [the U.S. and Russian leaders have a **special
responsibility to [avert military conflict]{.mark}** and to reduce the
threats posed by nuclear weapons. Failure is not an option.]{.underline}

Resuming a productive U.S.-Russian strategic dialogue will be difficult.
To get traction for the talks and begin the slow process of rebuilding
mutual trust and confidence, [the two countries should **develop a
framework for cooperation**]{.underline} [to deal with areas of common
or compatible interests]{.underline} and common threats, as well as for
managing disagreements. [[Given th]{.mark}e scale and scope of the
challenge and [the baggage]{.mark} that [both sides]{.mark} will
[bring]{.mark} to the table]{.underline}, small pragmatic steps should
be given precedence in the U.S. approach over big, ambitious goals. As
relations and other circumstances permit, [the priority]{.underline}
among these [should be]{.underline}: **[[avoid]{.mark}ing [a
U.S.-Russian conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in the
Euro-Atlantic]{.mark} area and]{.underline} **[[reducing]{.mark} the
risks of [inadvertent]{.mark} conflict and
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[[retool]{.mark}ing [strategic
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} response to the erosion of
[arms control]{.mark} and the development of new military
tech]{.underline}nologies[; cooperating to [prevent]{.mark} other
[countries from acquiring nuclear weapons;]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[preserving peace]{.mark} and stability]{.underline}** [[in the
M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}ast]{.underline}, especially the Persian Gulf;
[[preventing China from establishing heg]{.underline}]{.mark}emony over
the Asia-Pacific region; [[and managing]{.mark} U.S.-Russian competition
in [cyberspace.]{.mark}]{.underline}

AVOIDING U.S.-RUSSIAN CONFLICT

[Avoiding a conflict between the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and [Russia,]{.mark} and **especially
[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[should be the paramount U.S.
priority]{.underline}** [in the bilateral relationship]{.underline}.
Arguably, [there [is a]{.mark} much [great]{.mark}er [risk of]{.mark} an
[inadvertent war]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two countries [arising
[from]{.mark} [an **accident or miscalc**]{.mark}**ulations [and
miscomm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}---for example,
[[a]{.mark} military reaction to a **[false warning]{.mark}** of
attack]{.underline}---than from a premeditated attack.5 [The highest
risks are in the [Baltic and Black Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} regions,
where [[alliance members are]{.mark} most [vulnerable]{.mark} to an
attack with little warning and NATO and Russi]{.underline}an forces
[operate in close proximity.]{.underline} By the end of the next decade,
if not sooner, [the alliance and Russia should mutually aspire to
deterrent]{.underline} and defensive force [postures]{.underline} in
both regions that have eliminated or reduced to near zero the risk of a
conflict between them. However difficult to imagine, restoring a measure
of trust is necessary to improve the bilateral relationship. One way to
do this is for the United States and Russia to restore a serious and
strategic high-level dialogue, focused initially on building mutual
security in the Euro-Atlantic region.6 The two sides should address
several questions.

How worried is Russia about the risks of escalation and inadvertent
conflict in the European theater? If there is concern about the impact
of new weapons and technologies, what measures would Moscow consider
desirable and feasible for addressing the challenge of short warning
times available to the national command authorities to deescalate a
crisis before it precipitates armed conflict? What are Moscow's views
about how a crisis between NATO and Russia might begin and what
different escalatory paths it could take? How are changes in military,
surveillance, and other relevant technologies affecting Russia's crisis
calculations?

Should the United States and Russia, in addition to maintaining strict
compliance with their obligations under Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) agreements, consider more robust
transparency measures on force movements and notifications of exercises;
restrictions on the size, nature, and location of military exercises;
and geographic limits on where armed forces and weapons that can strike
deep into NATO territory and Russia can be deployed? Should they
consider new arms control negotiations in Europe that would constrain
deployments of destabilizing conventional weapons systems?

How can existing channels of communications for crisis management be
upgraded to mitigate the risks of confrontation? Should the two sides,
for example, create new bilateral civilian-military channels, starting
first perhaps at the operational level, that would work out and test new
procedures for crisis management?

**[MAINTAINING STRATEGIC STABILITY]{.underline}**

[[Strategic stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, defined here
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a condition [in which neither the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [nor Russia has an [**incentive
to strike first**]{.mark} with nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [[has
been]{.mark} an **[enduring]{.mark} feature of the U.S.-Russian nuclear
relationship** [for]{.mark} well **over [sixty
years]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In fact, [mutual vulnerability to nuclear
attack]{.underline}, based on secure second-strike capabilities, [has
proven to be highly resilient]{.underline} in the face of significant
changes in strategic force postures and military technologies. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Russia [share [a common
interest in]{.mark} **maintaining strategic stability** and
[eliminating]{.mark} all incentives for the use of any [nuclear]{.mark}
weapons]{.underline}---[a goal]{.underline} that will become
[increasingly difficult to achieve in the face of [emerging
weapons]{.mark} systems and tech]{.underline}nologies [[that could
**destabilize the nuclear relationship.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the near to mid-term, the risk of a premediated, large-scale nuclear
attack is extremely low. In [the longer term]{.underline}, however, [a
confluence of developments]{.underline}---[[the end of]{.mark}
U.S.-Russian strategic [arms control]{.mark}]{.underline} if the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is not [renewed and the
incorporation of new and potentially destabilizing
technologies]{.underline} into each country's conventional and nuclear
arsenals---[[coul]{.mark}d have far-reaching effects]{.underline},
**[[erod]{.mark}ing [strategic stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More
critically, [[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[could increase the risk
that an **accident or blunder** could **trigger**]{.mark} a conventional
conflict]{.underline} between the two countries [with the potential for
**[nuclear escalation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[By 2030, **if not sooner**]{.underline}, [it is conceivable that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.mark} might be [open to]{.mark} **establishing a new regime**
to [rebuild]{.mark} and adapt [the]{.mark} collapsing U.S.-Russian
**[arms control architecture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Such]{.mark} a
structure [would]{.mark} help **[maintain strategic stability]{.mark}**
[as both countries]{.mark} seek to [incorporate cyber]{.mark} weapons,
strategic conventional weapons, **[hypersonic missiles]{.mark}**,
space-based missile defense interceptors, ASAT weapons[, and AI]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} into their force postures and doctrines. [This goal
should become the central focus of a renewed high-level U.S.-Russian
dialogue on the requirements of strategic stability and nuclear risk
reduction.]{.underline} For this dialogue to be meaningful, it would
need to address the following questions.

[**["It is]{.mark} either [the end of nuclear weapons, or the end of
us," ]{.mark}**[wrote 16 winners of the Nobel Peace
Prize]{.mark}]{.underline} in an open letter in March that has since
been signed by more than a million people. Decades after the end of the
cold war and mere [months after]{.underline} the U.S., Russia and other
members of [the United Nations Security Council agreed]{.underline} that
"[a nuclear war cannot be won and must **never be fought,"** the specter
of [nuclear apocalypse]{.mark} again **[looms over
humankind]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Western powers contemplating intervention]{.mark} in]{.underline} the
war in [Ukraine "must [know]{.mark} that Russia will respond
immediatel]{.underline}y, and [[the consequences will be such]{.mark} as
you have **[never seen in]{.mark} your entire
[history,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} President Vladimir [[Putin
warned]{.mark} in a not so veiled threat of **[nuclear
retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline} on February 24, the day Russia
invaded Ukraine. Days later [he raised the alert levels of Russian
nuclear forces.]{.underline}

[If the prospect of nuclear war does not terrify you, it
should]{.underline}[. [If]{.underline}]{.mark} [either [Russia or NATO
used]{.mark}]{.underline} shorter-range "[tactical" [nuclear]{.mark}
weapons in a European conflict]{.underline}, [researchers]{.underline}
at Princeton University\'s Program on Science and Global Security
[concluded]{.underline} in a 2019 analysis, [[it could **rapidly
escalate into a thermonuclear war**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that would
kill]{.underline} or injure more than [90 million people **within a few
hours**]{.underline}. Further, [[the one treaty]{.mark} constraining the
nuclear arsenals of Russia and the U.S. **[will
expire]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2026. [The extreme level of distrust
between the adversaries]{.underline} makes it hard for them to
negotiate; nevertheless, they must urgently strive to reduce the nuclear
threat.

The crisis in [[Ukraine could **provide an
impetus**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1962 the U.S. and the Soviet Union
narrowly averted nuclear war over the deployment of [nuclear missiles in
Cuba]{.underline}. The terrifyingly close call [sparked an era of arms
control.]{.underline} Ten years later the U.S. and the Soviet Union
signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, constraining the
development of defensive shields against incoming missiles, and also
agreed to limit the numbers of intercontinental and other ballistic
missiles. Another agreement in 1987 banned intermediate-range nuclear
weapons, and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) of 1991 forced
significant reductions in U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals. These
**[[treaties create]{.mark}d ["guardrails,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** says
Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association, [[without which "one
side]{.mark} or the other [could **go over the nuclear
cliff."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The doctrine of mutually assured destruction]{.underline}, or
[[MAD]{.underline}, [held that neither superpower could
initiate]{.underline}]{.mark} [an attack [without]{.mark} itself
**[facing annihilation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But in 2002 the [[U.S.
withdrew from the ABM]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline} and began to build a
missile defense system**[, [destabilizing this uneasy
balance]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[sparking a new arms
race]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In 2019 then president [Donald Trump went
further, abandoning the]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**ntermediate-**[R]{.underline}**ange
**[N]{.underline}**uclear **[F]{.underline}**orces
**[T]{.underline}**reaty.

[These eliminations leave the New]{.underline} Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty, or New [START]{.underline}, negotiated by former presidents
Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, [as the **only constraint** on
the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons. [Negotiations]{.mark} for
renewing]{.underline} and possibly expanding the agreement
[[were]{.mark} scheduled]{.underline} to begin this year;
[these]{.underline} talks [have now been
**[suspended.]{.mark}**]{.underline} But [if New START is allowed to
lapse, a **new arms race** will begin]{.underline}.
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} then [unregulated nuclear [warheads were
**combined with**]{.mark} other unregulated [tech]{.mark}nologies, [such
as hypersonic or autonomous weapons, **the consequences would be
unimaginable.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[There is reason for hope]{.underline}: much of the rest of the world
has been doggedly pursuing arms control. Almost all nations signed
multilateral conventions that came into force in 1975 and 1997, banning
biological and chemical weapons, respectively. These [agreements may be
hard to enforce, but they confirm that the global community deems the
use of such weapons morally repugnant.]{.underline}

The U.N.\'s Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, advanced by
civil society in partnership with nonnuclear states, came into force in
January 2021. It aspires to "completely eliminate" nuclear weapons. None
of the nuclear-weapons states signed on. But the U.S. and Russia are
both signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1970, in
which nations without nuclear weapons agreed to never acquire them; in
exchange, they got access to peaceful nuclear technology and, crucially,
a promise from nuclear-armed nations to eventually eliminate nuclear
weapons.

Elimination admittedly seems elusive. Still, the U.S. could immediately
make the world a safer place by pledging to never be the first to use
nuclear weapons. And [as difficult as it may be, [the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[must strive to resume
negotiations]{.underline}** [with Russia to
**reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**the danger of [nuclear
warfare]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [We have lived long enough with this

Constrained and sometimes arbitrary financial support from member states
to many international organizations, particularly those with critical
international security functions, risks shortchanging their long-term
confidence and makes balanced and objective planning difficult. For
organizations devoted to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, this can negatively impact the deliberation and diligence
they require to investigate, analyze and act against state or other
actors seeking to unbalance global security norms and architecture.
[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has
a]{.underline} [**pivotal** role]{.underline}]{.mark} [to play
[in]{.mark} building support for a [global WMD nonprolif]{.mark}eration
system]{.underline} that works to support U.S. national interests and
global security. [[This will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [necessarily
[involve]{.mark} building **[international consensus]{.mark}** on
institutions]{.underline} that do not provide good nonproliferation
value-for-money, and seek to reform those organizations so they work
towards the common good.

[What? Me Worry?]{.underline}

Less government means better government, as propounded by Adam Smith in
The Wealth of Nations, became in the twilight of the last century, a
mantra of many western political leaders and the "Washington Consensus."
Coupled with residual distrust of foreign entanglements, this view
permeated not just the U.S. domestic political arena, but U.S. foreign
policy as well. For many international security institutions, including
those seeking to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD), the consensus came to mean small zero-growth regular
budgets, deferred investment in critical infrastructure, diverting
existing funds to the crises of the moment, and increased reliance on
voluntary donations -- in some organizations accounting for more than
the annual budget.

Adam [Smith]{.underline} would not be amused. Smith saw the
international arena as largely ungoverned interactions between states,
not at all akin to an overly regulated domestic economy. Indeed, he
[recognized the need for effective international institutions to manage
international relations.]{.underline} Moreover, Smith believed that the
arguments for less government intervention and free trade did not apply
to matters of national security and foreign policy. And, truly, in this
case, two wrongs do not make a right.

[Let's focus on the impact this restrictive funding approach has had on
an **[existential global security problem]{.mark} [-- WMD
prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}. The awareness of the risk posed by
WMD proliferation increased significantly in the early twenty-first
century.1 However, efforts to stop the spread and use of WMD prior to
9/11 focused on actions taken by states. Thus, the international order
on WMD included agreements such as the Geneva Protocol of 1925, the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1970), the Biological and Toxin
Weapons Convention (BWC, 1975), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC,
1997), the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials
(CPPNM, 1987), and the four main export control supplier groups, i.e.,
the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Wassenaar Arrangement.

However, [[after 9/11]{.underline}]{.mark} and other mass casualty
attacks, [[attention shifted to non-state actors]{.mark} and their
pursuit of WMD]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of
the mail to spread Anthrax, the activities of the A.Q. Khan network, and
[[the **interest in WMD**]{.mark} shown [by Al-Qaeda]{.mark} and other
terrorists. This]{.underline} shift [led the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations (UN) Security Council [to identify the
**[prolif]{.mark}eration [of WMD to terrorist groups]{.mark}** [as a
**major threat to international peace**]{.mark} and
security]{.underline} in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540 in
April 2004. UNSCR 1540 changed the perceptual dynamic about the
potential of terrorists and others to use WMD, and it quickened the
development of new nonproliferation institutions.2 In addition to UNSCR
1540, the early years of the century saw the creation of the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), the G7 (then G8) Global
Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass
Destruction (GP), the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism
(GCINT), the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of
Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT), and the amendment strengthening the CPPNM,
among others.

In parallel, several existing international institutions adapted to
these new threats and risks. The International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) gained a greater mandate to address nuclear security (further
enhanced through the four Nuclear Security Summits). The Organisation
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) increased its focus on
chemical security to prevent the re-emergence of chemical weapons
programs and took on even greater responsibilities with the use of
chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. The UN Security Council took
unprecedented actions in seeking to end the WMD programs of Libya, the
DPRK, and Iran, while the UN Office of Disarmament Affairs took on new
responsibilities for investigations on the use of chemical and
biological weapons and other nonproliferation activities. Several
organizations added or expanded the prevention of WMD proliferation in
their portfolio, such as the Financial Action Task Force, INTERPOL, and
the World Customs Organizations. Similarly, several of the
aforementioned supplier groups adapted their controls to increase their
focus on non-state actor threats or threats from pre-existing state WMD
programs.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has had a **leadership
role** in creating and maintaining every one of these agreements and
institutions]{.underline}, as the nonproliferation of WMD became a
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, especially after the end of the Cold
War. The United States drove the development of the international legal
and diplomatic landscape of WMD nonproliferation through the creation of
these institutions, agreements, arrangements, and regimes.
[[Prolif]{.mark}eration of WMD has almost **always [depend]{.mark}ed
up[on international cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so not
surprisingly, [effective efforts to prevent proliferation depend on
multilateral cooperation and coordination.]{.underline}

Has the United States found these institutions useful? Conduct a simple
thought experiment: Without them, which countries or non-state actors
would now have significant stockpiles of, or access to, WMD that
currently have none? How well could a single country (or the
international community) credibly detect or effectively limit
clandestine WMD programs in their absence? The United States has found
the value of these institutions so great that even during the Cold War
it found ways to create and cooperate in these institutions with its
greatest adversary -- such as its bilateral negotiations with the USSR
to draft the NPT.

Russia---An Increasingly Unreliable Nonproliferation Partner

• [[Russia is **inevitably**]{.mark} **a player** [in]{.mark} **most
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration issues**]{.underline} [by virtue of its many
roles: [as]{.mark}]{.underline} [one of three [NPT depositary]{.mark}
governments, a leading member of the IAEA board, [a **permanent member**
of the UN Security Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and a participant in
both the Iranian-P5+1 talks and Six-Party Talks with North
Korea]{.underline}; [as [a]{.mark} potential [source of
sensitive]{.mark} equipment, [materials]{.mark}, and technology; and as
[a]{.mark} **traditional [friend of countries of prolif]{.mark}eration
[concern.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

• [[Few nonprolif]{.mark}eration [problems can be resolved **without
Russia**]{.mark}**'s active support**]{.underline} or at least
acquiescence, and [Moscow is often well-positioned to play a spoiler
role.]{.underline}

• [Russia and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[have
common interests]{.underline}** [in stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and other WMD]{.underline} to additional countries,
[**[preventing terrorists]{.underline}** [from
getting]{.underline}]{.mark} [their hands on [WMD]{.mark} and related
materials, and avoiding a direct military confrontation.]{.underline}

• But Moscow has often given nonproliferation a lower priority relative
to other Russian goals: demonstrating its support for friendly states,
promoting its commercial interests, asserting its major-power status,
thwarting U.S. objectives, and opposing (U.S.-led) economic sanctions.

• [[Despite]{.mark} their]{.underline} many [[differences,]{.mark} [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark}
the [USSR]{.mark} often [saw **eye to eye on
nonprolif**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}, [starting [with the]{.mark}
negotiation of the [NPT]{.mark}]{.underline} (which for the Soviet Union
was a means of preventing a nuclear-armed Germany). [But post-USSR,
post--Cold War cooperation has been uneven and has deteriorated sharply
since]{.underline} Russia's annexation of [Crimea]{.underline} in 2014.

RUSSIA'S RECORD IN KEY AREAS

CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH THIRD COUNTRIES

Nuclear technology is one of Russia's few industrial strengths.
Especially given Moscow's bleak economic outlook, it is aggressively
marketing its nuclear reactors and related services in several regions
of the world.

• [[Russia is the only reactor]{.mark} supplier [willing to take back
plutonium]{.mark}-bearing spent fuel to its territory,
something]{.underline} that is [good]{.underline} both [for
nonproliferation]{.underline} and for Rosatom's sales pitch (because
[returning the spent fuel to Russia **eliminates the burden of storing
it**]{.underline} for prospective customers).

• However, [Russia is believed to be less demanding]{.underline} than
the United States [in]{.underline} terms of
[nonproliferation]{.underline} conditions and assurances required of
cooperation partners. A significant difference is that the United States
strongly discourages the acquisition of enrichment and reprocessing
capabilities, while Russia is more tolerant of countries acquiring such
capabilities and counts on legal restrictions and IAEA safeguards to
prevent countries from using fuel-cycle facilities to produce fissile
material for nuclear weapons.

COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION AND NUCLEAR MATERIALS SECURITY

[U.S.-Russian cooperation **since the early 1990s greatly reduced** the
[prolif]{.mark}eration risks stemming from the collapse of the
USSR]{.underline}. [Among the highlights were [security upgrades at
Russia]{.mark}n]{.underline} military and civilian [nuclear
facilities]{.underline}, [the blend-down of 500 tons of highly enriched
uranium]{.underline} from Soviet-era nuclear weapons that was then sold
to the United States for use as nuclear reactor fuel, and the
repatriation of Russian-origin HEU-bearing reactor fuels from Central
and Eastern Europe.

• [But [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, chafing at the donor-recipient
optic and suspicious of the presence of American monitors at sensitive
Russian facilities, **[[terminated]{.mark} practically all bilateral
nuclear security [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in 2013--2014,
and, in the wake of]{.underline} the [Crimea]{.underline} annexation,
[the U.S. Congress prohibited the use of U.S. funds in
Russia]{.underline}, effectively **[precluding even the few remaining
areas]{.underline}** [of cooperation.]{.underline}

• [Russian authorities argue]{.underline} that [they can]{.underline}
**[effectively secure]{.underline}** [their nuclear materials and
facilities without U.S. help]{.underline}. But [U.S. observers assert
that [there is]{.mark} much [unfinished]{.mark} nuclear security
[business]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russia, and [they strongly
[doubt]{.mark} that [Moscow has]{.mark} either the resolve or [the
financial resources]{.mark} **to do the job itself**]{.underline},
especially [[given]{.mark} pressures on the Russian budget from
[sanctions and low oil prices.]{.mark}]{.underline}

• A symptom of the U.S.-Russian divorce on nuclear security was the
[Russian decision not to participate in the Nuclear Security
Summit]{.underline} on March 31--April 1, 2016. The decision, which the
Russians say was [based on the heavy-handed, dominating preparatory role
played by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, was widely seen
as President Vladimir Putin's post-sanctions snub of President Barack
Obama, the host.

//smarx, AZG\]

Unveiling the 2020 Doomsday Clock in partnership with the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists, Mary Robinson [call]{.underline}s [for an
**urgent change of mindset**]{.underline} [to challenge the
**existential threats facing humanity.**]{.underline}

The following is a transcript of her 23 January speech

Thank you Rachel. Governor Brown, Chair Bob Rosner, ladies and
gentleman.

On behalf of myself, Ban Ki-moon and all The Elders: it is a great
honour to be here today, for what can only be described as a solemn
occasion.

I must say when I revealed the new time, I felt more and more anger, the
reaction of an angry grandmother, at what is happening.

When Nelson Mandela founded The Elders in 2007, he spoke of the need to
"support courage where there is fear, [foster agreement where there is
conflict]{.underline} and inspire hope where there is despair". I often
recall these words, but rarely do they feel as important as they do
today.

[The Doomsday clock is a globally recognised indicator of **the
vulnerability of our existence**.]{.underline} It is a striking metaphor
for the precarious state of the world but, most frighteningly as we have
just heard, it is a metaphor backed by rigorous scientific scrutiny.
[This is no mere analogy]{.underline}. [[We]{.mark} are now **100
seconds to midnight** and the world needs to wake up.]{.underline}

[Our planet [face]{.mark}s]{.underline} two simultaneous
[**[existential]{.underline}** t]{.mark}hreats: the climate crisis and
[[nuclear weapons.]{.underline}]{.mark} We are faced by a gathering
storm of extinction-level consequences, and [[time is running
out.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The science of the climate crisis makes it imperative that we take
urgent action in 2020. We need a change of mindset in politics, finance,
business and civil society, one that enables us to keep temperature
rises at or below 1.5°C, whilst protecting the rights, dignity and
livelihoods of those affected by the shift to a carbon neutral economy.

Not to do so will be a death sentence for humanity, and yet, world
leaders continue to ignore the science: international climate summits
fail to reach agreement and investment in the exploration and
exploitation of fossil fuels continues to increase.

Despite this dire picture of failing leadership and narrow
self-interest, we can draw hope and inspiration from the young
schoolchildren and activists who are striking under the banner "Fridays
For Future".

Here in the United States, I have been hugely inspired by the way so
many people from politics, business, labour unions, faith groups,
women's and youth movements declared they were "Still In" the Paris
accord despite the Federal Administration's withdrawal -- including of
course Governor Brown in California.

However, whilst [[public pressure gives us]{.mark} a sliver of [hope for
our climate, **the opposite is true on nuclear.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[As long as nuclear weapons remain]{.mark} in existence, [it is
**inevitable**]{.mark} that [they will]{.mark} **one day [be
used]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [whether [by **accident,
miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** [or design]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Yet the [scale of a potential catastrophe]{.underline}, and discussion
on what can be done to deescalate the risk of a nuclear war [has been
given a shockingly low amount of consideration]{.underline} by political
decision-makers, opinion formers and the public.

This is why The Elders have proposed a 'nuclear minimisation' agenda
that, we believe, would significantly contribute to reducing the threat
of nuclear catastrophe.

Our positions are summed up by what we call the "4 D's":

Doctrine: every nuclear state should make an unequivocal "No First Use"
declaration;

De-alerting: almost all warheads should be taken off high alert status;

Deployment: substantially reduce the one-quarter of all nuclear warheads
that are currently operationally deployed;

[Decreased numbers: **[dramatically cut the number of]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}** in existence.]{.underline}

However, such proposals will never come to pass if we do not [first
**[defend and strengthen]{.mark}** the nuclear [arms
controls]{.mark}]{.underline} that still exist.

The Elders believe [this must [begin with the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia
**negotiating the extension** of]{.mark} New [START]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- [the **only remaining bilateral agreement** between these two nuclear
super powers]{.underline} -- without delay.

I note that President [[Putin]{.mark} has explicitly said he [is
ready]{.mark} to do this]{.underline}, so I urge President Trump to
respond in kind so both men can get down to business. [They should
recall and reiterate the declaration of their predecessors]{.underline}
Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev [that "a nuclear war cannot be won
and must **never be fought".**]{.underline} These were pioneering words
at the time and [the world needs to hear them again.]{.underline}

[[Such]{.underline}]{.mark} a step [[would]{.mark} help [**create an
environment** for]{.mark} nuclear [disarmament]{.mark} ahead of the
**N**]{.underline}on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty [Review Conference]{.underline} later this year
[[and **inspire other leaders**]{.mark}]{.underline} to take similarly
bold steps.

Let such a nuclear détente be the way the world marks both the 75th
anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the 50th anniversary of the
Non Proliferation Treaty. Let this year be the start of new era of
nuclear negotiations. Let us hope to return here in a year's time to
reveal the hands on this clock are further from midnight than they are
today.

**[Iran.]{.underline}** Although [[Moscow]{.mark} was [willing to accept
a]{.mark} larger [Iranian civil nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}
than the United States or the Europeans, opposed economic sanctions in
principle, and sought throughout the nuclear talks to maintain good

[role in]{.mark} the [negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}, including by
[[gaining Iran's agreement to ship]{.mark} **virtually [its entire
stock]{.mark}** [of enriched uranium to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Its nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration and commercial [[interests
coincided]{.underline}]{.mark}. By supporting low limits on Tehran's
enrichment capacity, **[[Moscow could ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[[Iran would **remain dependent** on Russia to provide fuel]{.mark} for

### Impact\-\--Terrorism\-\--2NC

#### US-Russian relations [solve]{.underline} terrorism.

**Kseniya '18** \[Konovalova; 05/15/2018; Master Student, School of
International Relations, St. Petersburg State University; "РОССИЯ И
АМЕРИКА В СОВРЕМЕННОМ ГЛОБАЛЬНОМ МИРЕ,"

Counter-terrorism policy includes the practice, military tactics,
techniques and strategy that government, military, law enforcement and
intelligence agencies use to fight terrorism. Counter-terrorism
strategies also attempts to counter financing of terrorism. In case
terrorism arises due to border insurgency, counter-terrorism may use
counter-insurgency measures to curb it.

Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} became the Russian president]{.underline} in
2000, [and his [**central idea for Russian-U. S. cooperation**
was]{.mark} coordination on **[anti-terrorism]{.mark}**
policy]{.underline}. [[Chechnya was]{.mark} an [important]{.mark}
element]{.underline} for Putin. Even before the 9/11 event, [Putin has
repeatedly warned]{.underline} the United States of [the connection
between Russia's Chechen insurgency and fighting international terrorism
but the U. S. has never paid attention.]{.underline} [U. S.-Russia
counter-terrorism initiatives have been hampered by "the problematic
legacy of the cold war]{.underline} [and the lack of]{.underline} a
post-cold war security system competent of [incorporating **revised
attitudes**]{.underline} and meeting new international challenges, for
instance may it be Kosovo conflict in 1999, the military operation in
Iraq (2003), the Russia-Georgia crisis (2008), NATO's operations in
Libya (2011) and in the Ukraine crisis" \[7\].

The tragic events of **[9/11 marked a turning point]{.underline}** [in
the deteriorating U. S.-Russia relations particularly in **combating
terrorism**]{.underline}. Russia's reaction to the 9/11 terrorist
attacks on the U. S. was quick and constructive. [President Putin was
the first foreign leader to call]{.underline} President [Bush to
**express his condolences** and offer help]{.underline}. On request of
Washington, [he cancelled a few ongoing military exercises and ordered
Russian armed forces to terminate their standard operation responses to
U. S. nuclear forces' heightened state of alert]{.underline} \[8\].
[**Putin delineated [Moscow's support]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
the U. S. military campaign in [[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
"Operation Enduring Freedom" [[in]{.mark} terms of]{.underline}
[**[intelligence sharing]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [opening of [Russian
airspace]{.mark}]{.underline} for U. S. planes carrying humanitarian
aid, [help in [search-and-rescue]{.mark}]{.underline} operations in
Afghanistan, [enhanced [military assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance [and implicit endorsement
for]{.underline} the offer made by former Soviet Central Asian States of
**[logistical support]{.underline}** to the U. S. military \[9\].

The attack of [9[/11 gave Putin an opportunity to substantiate
the]{.mark} Second Chechen War as part of the **["Global War on
Terror"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} it was a justification of
[his stand **on**]{.mark} **the global nature of
[terrorism,]{.mark}**]{.underline} of which [Chechnya was only a
manifestation]{.underline}. [[He advocated for a **intensive global
effort**]{.mark} to tackle]{.underline} the threat caused by
[international terrorism.]{.underline}

In May 2002, President Bush and President Putin signed the treaty of
Moscow. This treaty considerably lowered the levels of operationally
deployed warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 \[10\]. They offered a
combined condemnation of all terrorist attacks, and pledged to achieve a
negotiated settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [The
Russian-U. S. Working Group on Fighting Terrorism was an important
mechanism]{.underline} which was formed in 2002. [This group considers
issues related to counter terrorist, nuclear and WMD threats.
It]{.underline} also [undertakes coordinating actions]{.underline} in
[blocking]{.underline} the means of [financial support of terrorism and
combating against illegal drugs trafficking]{.underline}, which has been
the major source of income of terrorist financing.

The increasing **[[cooperation]{.mark} on anti-terrorism]{.underline}**
between the two countries [[resulted in **greater
understanding**]{.mark} between the two powers]{.underline}. [[However,
**tension erupted** over]{.mark} the U. S]{.underline}. plan of
[invasion in [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} under the pretence of accusation
of the Saddam regime possessing weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
[Russia insisted on peaceful resolution of]{.underline} the
[Iraq]{.underline} dispute and along with France and Germany, **[it
strongly opposed the U. S. plan to attack Iraq]{.underline}** [without
the UN Security Council sanction. It condemned the unilateral
action]{.underline} of the U. S. invasion in Iraq in March 2003
supported by Britain.

Despite these disagreements, [the USA and Russia continued to
**cooperate on anti-terrorism** issues]{.underline}. In March and
October 2004, the U.S.-Russia Counter Terrorism Group met fostering
cooperative operational contacts between various U.S. agencies and their
counter parts in Russia. In December 2004, [Chiefs of FBI and FSB signed
a comprehensive memorandum of cooperation on
counterterrorism,]{.underline} according to which [both the
[countries]{.mark} would timely **[share]{.mark} the terrorist threat
[info]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also [decided
to]{.underline} expand their cooperation to [include information on
WMD]{.underline}. After the terrorist bombing of two Russian civil
aircrafts in August 2004, Russia also cooperated with the Transportation
Security Agency to raise airport security. However, Russians expressed
their criticism regarding lack of reciprocity in the information
sharing. Isakova mentions that [[Russia]{.mark} had [provided vital
intelligence]{.mark} data [on Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline} to United
States; while the CIA was providing their Russian counterparts just
basic data and accountability of known facts. The Russian side was
disappointed with such disproportionate cooperation.

In February 2006, the [USA designated three Russian organizations as
terrorist bodies on the **demand of Russia.**]{.underline} They were the
Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, which carried out Dubrovka Theatre
attack (2002), the Riyadus-Salikhin Recon-naissance and Sabotage
Battalion of Chechen Martyrs which carried out Beslan School Attack
(2004) and the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB), which
operates in North Caucasus and whose Arab leaders are the main channel
for Islamic funding of the Chechen Guerrillas.

In January 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the president of the
USA. In July 2009, he visited Moscow; he had meetings with President
Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin. Speaking at the New School of
Economics [Obama told that, "America wants a strong, peaceful and
prosperous Russia.]{.underline} [This belief is rooted in]{.underline}
our respect for the Russian people, and [a shared history between our
nations that goes beyond competition"]{.underline} \[11\]. In March
2010, the United States and Russia reached an agreement to reduce their
accumulation of nuclear weapons. On April 8, 2010 the new nuclear arms
reduction treaty, which was called the New START was signed by President
Obama and President Medvedev. This agreement reduced the number of
long-range nuclear weapons held by each country to around 1,500 from
1,700--2,200 set by the Moscow Treaty of 2002 \[12\]. The 1991 Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty which expired in December 2009 was replaced by the
New START.

In March 2012, Vladimir Putin was re-elected as the President of Russia
for the third term. In September 2013, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia made an agreement that placed Syria's
chemical weapons under international control]{.underline} with
successive annihilation. It was enshrined in the UNSC Resolution 2118 at
its 7038th meeting on 27 September 2013 \[13\]. In July 2014, [the
U.S.government officially accused Russia of having breached
the]{.underline} 1987 [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces]{.underline}
(INF) [Treaty]{.underline} by testing a banned medium-range
ground-launched cruise missile (probably R-500, a modification of
Iskander) \[14\]. [The U.S. were also concerned by the
test-firing]{.underline} in 2014 of the Russian RS--26 Rubezh
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which was capable of evading the
existing anti-ballistic missile defenses. In June 2015, the U.S. State
Department reported that Russia has failed to correct the violation of
the I.N.F.Treaty \[15\]. [Since then the [Russia-US relation]{.mark}
have been **[deteriorating]{.mark} with [every]{.mark} passing
[day]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Russia's annexation of [Crimea]{.mark}
in March 2014 [added]{.mark} more **[fuel to the
fire]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Due to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis]{.underline}, [the [relations]{.mark} between
Russia and the U.S.[are **at their worst**]{.mark} since the end of the
Cold War.]{.underline}

In November 2016, Donald Trump was elected as the president of the USA.
[Putin and Trump]{.underline} met at G--20 summit in Hamburg, Germany in
July 2017. Trump confronted Putin about tampering the 2016 US elections,
but Putin denied Russia's involvement. Apart from this, both leaders
**[discussed counterterrorism,]{.underline}** cybercrimes, Syria,
Ukraine, etc. As a result, both countries even announced a ceasefire in
southern Syria. In December 2017, [**[the CIA informed
Russia]{.underline}** [about terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} [who were
planning the explosion in St. Petersburg]{.underline} \[16\]. The
attackers intended to detoned usually overcrowded sites including the
Kazan Cathedral. Vladimir [Putin expressed his gratitude to the
CIA,]{.underline} and the Russian FSB agents found explosives and
weapons and the suspects were taken into custody. [The U. S. missile
strike on Syria in April 2018 led to a **dramatic rift between the two
countries**.]{.underline} [Russia condemned U. S. for its actions
against Syria]{.underline}. After the attack [the Kremlin decided to
suspend the 2015 memorandum of understanding on the air operations.
Under the agreement]{.underline}, [[the two countries]{.mark} have
**[traded info]{.mark}rmation** [about flights by US]{.mark}-led
coalition [targeting the Islamic State]{.mark}]{.underline} and Russian
planes functioning in Syria in support of the Assad government. The
Defense Ministry reported that [Moscow]{.underline} was taking this
action, because it [regarded the U. S. strike on Syria "as a **grave
violation of the memorandum."**]{.underline} President [Putin believed
that "the American strikes against Syria are an **aggression** against a
sovereign government in violations of the norms of international law,
and under a far-fetched pretext".]{.underline}

MOSCOW, January 13. /TASS/. Russia is not sure whether its US and NATO
partners will resort to concessions regarding proposed security
guarantees, but the dialogue on this issue is still underway at various
levels, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an
interview with the RTVI television channel. Asked whether Moscow hoped
for concessions on behalf of Russia's US and NATO partners regarding
security guarantees, Ryabkov said: \"Hope springs eternal.\" \"However,
in this case, we are rather uncertain that this is possible,\" the
high-ranking [**[Russia]{.mark}**n diplomat said. \"We need [to continue
**being insistent**]{.mark} to achieve the right course and the right
evolution on the Western side]{.underline}. This is what we will
continue doing.\" \"I must reiterate that [**[dialogue is]{.mark}**
still **[underway]{.mark}**]{.underline} at many levels and in many
directions,\" Ryabkov added. The negotiations between Moscow and
Washington dedicated to Russia's proposed security guarantees concluded
on January 10 in Geneva. On January 12, Russia discussed its security
concerns in Europe, as well as its drafts on security assurances at a
meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels, and on January 13 is
discussing the same issue at the Vienna session of the OSCE Permanent
Council. On December 17, 2021, the [Russian Foreign Ministry published
the [**draft agreements** between Russia and the US on]{.mark} security
guarantees and the measures of ensuring the [security of]{.mark} Russia
and [**NATO** member states]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO ready to hear As
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and US Representative to NATO
Julianne Smith said earlier, the [Western-led bloc is ready to hear
Russia's concerns]{.underline} and is ready to begin an open and
reasonable dialogue but is not ready for compromises, especially on the
issues of its expansion. [Moscow's [security **demands** are addressed
to the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and European
nations. Moscow has not sent them to such international organizations as
the European Union (EU) and NATO. In a broad outline, Russia's stance
boils down to [[three key points: the **pullout of US nuclear weapons**
from Europe, the termination of]{.mark} the practice of [deploying
NATO's]{.mark} conventional [forces]{.mark} near Russia's borders and
creating its military infrastructure there, [and NATO's official
**refusal to** draw **Ukraine**]{.mark} and Georgia [into the
alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Moscow's opinion, these measures
[[will]{.mark} help [remedy]{.mark} a serious [imbalance in
security]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline} that emerged after the break-up
of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. This [will help [**considerably
ease** the military]{.mark} and political **[tension

of the OSCE member states at their Istanbul summit in 1999 that the

[The June 16, 2021 meeting in **[Geneva]{.mark}** between U.S. President
Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin [gave a positive impulse
to a **bilateral U.S.-Russia relationship**]{.mark} that was plumbing
post-Cold War depths.]{.underline} Both sides made modest progress in
the following months, only to be wholly derailed by Putin's war of
choice against Ukraine. It will be a long time before the U.S.-Russia
relationship can approach anything that resembles "normal."

[[Early on in the]{.mark} Biden [presidency]{.mark} in 2021,
administration [officials made clear their]{.mark} readiness to [[push
back](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/04/26/the-first-100-days-breaking-with-trump-on-russia/) against
Russian overreach]{.mark},]{.underline} including with the use of
additional sanctions. At the same time, they noted the value of
guardrails to keep in check the adversarial aspects of the relationship.
[[Less than one week after Biden took office]{.mark}, [he and
Putin [agreed to
extend](https://www.politico.eu/article/putin-and-biden-confirm-extension-of-new-start-treaty/) the
**New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty**]{.mark} to 2026.]{.underline}

Interestingly,
[[both [**Biden**](https://www.armscontrol.org/armscontrol2022/POTUSmessage) and [the
**Kremlin**](https://tass.com/politics/1461157?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google.com&utm_referrer=google.com) have]{.mark}
recently [expressed]{.mark} a [desire to resume the **U.S.-Russia
dialogue** on **strategic stability**]{.mark} at some
point]{.underline}. That likely will not begin again until well after
the Russia-Ukraine war ends, and it would then be a dialogue conducted
by two countries coldly seeking to put constraints on what both regard
as an adversarial relationship.

[Ruling out a reset, [U.S. officials spoke of]{.mark} building [a
**predictable**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
[[**[stable](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-russia/engage-russia-but-remain-clear-eyed-while-doing-so-blinken-tells-nato-idUSKBN2BG2H6) relationship**
with Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin surely did not like it when
Biden referred to him as
a [killer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/europe/russia-biden-putin-killer.html) in
March 2021, but that did not prevent the Russian president from
accepting Biden's invitation to meet in Geneva.

The mistrust and bad blood will make cooperation challenging, even on
issues where both countries' interests converge, such as arms control,
climate change, and dealing with Afghanistan. [[Restoring]{.mark}
anything that looks like normalcy in the [bilateral]{.mark}
[relationship will]{.mark} likely [require]{.mark} two
things]{.underline}. First, [[Putin's departure from the
Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that may not happen for years.
Second, [[when Putin leaves power, his successor]{.mark} likely
[will]{.mark} have to [make]{.mark} significant policy [changes to
demonstrate that Russia will play by the rules of the international
order]{.mark}, no longer seek to use military force to impose its will
on neighboring states, and be ready to work with the West [for a
**stable** and **secure** Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
that will be some time in coming.

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky said last week about Russia's president. "[I need to talk to
Putin]{.underline}. [[The **world** needs to **talk** to
**Putin**]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is no other way to stop this war."

[The United States should heed this plea.]{.underline} Ukraine's
resistance to Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion has been both
heroic and effective, but its situation is precarious. For all their
flaws, Russia's armed forces may yet prevail in a prolonged conflict,
and there is still a real danger that much of Ukraine will become a
Russian vassal state under a puppet government. Moreover, even if
Ukraine can hold off Russian forces indefinitely, the prospect of
forcibly evicting them from its territory---particularly in the
south---is daunting. All the while, Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's
citizens ever more indiscriminately.

But as Zelensky's statement suggests, [[Ukraine's plan]{.mark} to end
this war [is]{.mark} probably [not to vanquish the invading
forces]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Rather]{.mark}, its goal appears to be
[to make the prospect of continuing the war, and the occupation]{.mark}
that could follow it, exceptionally [**painful** for]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark}**---]{.underline}so painful that Putin comes to view a
settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine's independence as the lesser
of two evils.

[[Putin may already be **feeling** the **pain**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The United States believes that Putin embarked on this war seeking to
conquer most or all of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has implicitly recognized
Zelensky's government by demanding, in return for an end to the war,
that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian
territory, and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. If
Ukrainian forces continue to perform well, Putin will have to settle for
still less and may even have to pay Ukraine reparations. (Conversely,
[if Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin will be able to drive a
harder bargain.)]{.underline}

Even in the best case, [[if]{.mark} [Zelensky wants a negotiated
settlement]{.mark}, [he]{.mark} [will]{.mark} likely have to
[make]{.mark} significant [concessions to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---as he has acknowledged. Any such
concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United
States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The
democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what
price it is willing to pay for an end to the slaughter of its citizens
and the preservation of Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state.

[[The **United States**]{.mark} and its allies [should support
**Zelensky** in any **diplomatic course** he
**pursues**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[he cannot end the war
without them.]{.mark}]{.underline} Economic sanctions on Russia
strengthen his hand at the negotiating table by raising the costs to
Russia of continuing to fight. By the same token, however, it is
virtually inconceivable that Russia would agree to a settlement without
sanctions relief. For this reason[, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
and its allies [must be prepared to **lift
sanctions**]{.mark}---including on Russia's central bank---if Russia
[and]{.mark} Ukraine negotiate and [implement a **settlement
agreement**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

To date[, [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its allies
have sent out **mixed messages**]{.mark} about **sanctions
relief**]{.underline}. U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland
indicated an openness to it. By contrast, French Finance Minister Bruno
Le Maire has declared "economic and financial war on Russia" with the
goal of causing "the collapse of the Russian economy." In a similar
vein, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that "the purpose
of the sanctions is to debilitate the Russian economy." [This
[**ambiguity** is **dangerous**]{.mark} because it risks obscuring the
existence of an off-ramp for Putin [and could]{.mark} thus prolong the
conflict and [increase]{.mark} [the]{.mark} small but real [chance of
**nuclear escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[U.S. President Joe **Biden** should clear up the confusion by stating
publicly that the purpose of sanctions is to end the war, not to remove
the government of Russia.]{.underline} In coordination with Kyiv, he
should dispatch a trusted lieutenant---such as Secretary of State Antony
Blinken or CIA Director William Burns---to try to negotiate with Russia.
[[**Washington** and its allies could]{.mark} also [explore whether they
could address Russian **security concerns**]{.mark}**,** and vice versa,
[through]{.mark} the [implementation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} reciprocal
[**arms control** measures]{.mark}---as the United States and NATO
proposed in January.]{.underline}

Success in this endeavor would be far from guaranteed, and the Biden
administration would take heat for even trying. This criticism, however,
could be undercut by Zelensky's stating publicly that he would support
sanctions relief for Russia in return for the implementation of any
agreement he negotiated.

And what of Putin? Is he willing to negotiate?

This question is difficult to answer because if he is interested in
negotiations, [he has a clear incentive to downplay that interest right
now.]{.underline} It is certainly possible that he will push on,
regardless of any concessions that Zelensky might offer. Indeed, he
informed French President Emmanuel Macron last week that the objectives
of Russia's invasion "will be fulfilled in any case."

However, as everyone who has haggled over anything knows, you end up
paying a higher price if you make it clear from the start that you're
desperate to buy. In this vein, [[**Putin** may be trying to **extract**
greater **concessions** at the negotiating table]{.mark} by claiming
that he has no interest in talking.]{.underline} Ultimately, it is
impossible to know whether there is a deal to be had unless we try to
get it.

**Kupchan 22** \[Charles Kupchan; 06/15/22; Professor of international
affairs at Georgetown University and senior fellow at the Council on

As the war in Ukraine grinds through its fourth month, defiant
Ukrainians continue to bloody Russian's invasion force. The United
States and its allies are backstopping Ukraine's staunch defense of its
territory through a steady inflow of weapons. The goal, as President Joe
Biden put it in a recent essay in the New York Times, is "to work to
strengthen Ukraine and support its efforts to achieve a negotiated end
to the conflict." [A [**negotiated end**]{.mark} to the conflict [is
**the right goal**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and one that needs to arrive
sooner rather than later. [[Ukraine]{.mark} likely **[lacks]{.mark} the
[combat power]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to expel Russia from all
of its territory, and the momentum on the battlefield is shifting in
Russia's favor. The longer this conflict continues, the greater the
death and destruction, the more severe the disruptions to the global
economy and the food supply, and the higher the risk of escalation to
full-scale war between Russia and NATO. Transatlantic unity is starting
to fray, with France, Germany, Italy and other allies uneasy about the
prospect of a prolonged war --- [especially against the backdrop of
rising inflation]{.underline}. But if [[Biden]{.mark} is serious about
facilitating negotiations, he [needs to]{.mark} do a better job of
[lay]{.mark}ing [the political groundwork]{.mark} and shaping a
narrative that prioritizes arriving at a diplomatic
endgame]{.underline}. There is still too much hawkish rhetoric in
Washington, with U.S. arms flowing to Ukraine "so that it can," in the
words of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, "repel Russian aggression
and fully defend its independence and sovereignty." Meanwhile, Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insists, not surprisingly, that "victory
will be ours" and urges Ukrainians to "defend every meter of our land."
And Biden, even as he makes mention of the [**[need for
diplomacy]{.mark}**,]{.underline} has so far been unwilling to caution
Kyiv against those aims, instead affirming "I will not pressure the
Ukrainian government --- in private or public --- to make any
territorial concessions." "We're not going to tell the Ukrainians how to
negotiate, what to negotiate and when to negotiate," Colin Kahl, the
undersecretary of defense for policy, reiterated this week. "They're
going to set those terms for themselves." [But [Washington has]{.mark}
not only a right to discuss war aims with Kyiv, but also **[an
obligation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This conflict arguably represents the
most dangerous geopolitical moment since the Cuban missile crisis. [A
hot [war]{.mark} is raging [between]{.mark} a [**nuclear-armed Russia**
and]{.mark} a [NATO-armed Ukraine]{.mark}, with NATO territory abutting
the conflict zone.]{.underline} This war could define the strategic and
economic contours of the 21st century, possibly opening an era of
militarized rivalry between the world's liberal democracies and an
autocratic bloc anchored by Russia and China. [These stakes [necessitate
**direct U.S. engagement**]{.mark} in determining when and how this war
ends. [Instead of offering arms]{.mark} with no strings attached ---
effectively leaving strategy up to the Ukrainians --- [Washington needs
to launch]{.mark} a forthright [discussion]{.mark} about [war
**termination with allies**]{.mark}, with Kyiv, and ultimately, with
Moscow.]{.underline}

Russia\'s military forces have formed a horseshoe around Ukraine,
surrounding it on three sides. The [[U.S.]{.mark} and its allies have
been [working to **deter Russia**]{.mark} from turning that military
buildup into an invasion, in large part through **diplomatic
efforts**.]{.underline} One of the Biden administration\'s most
experienced negotiators is Wendy Sherman. She worked out deals with
North Korea during the Clinton administration, then the Iran nuclear
deal under Obama. And now Sherman is leading the American effort to
de-escalate the tensions between Ukraine and Russia. Deputy Secretary of
State Wendy Sherman joins me now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you very much for having me. FLORIDO: Let\'s start
by talking about where things are. So far, [the strategy has been to
threaten **[severe sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And yet there seems
to be very little diplomatic progress. Putin continues to amass forces
at the Ukraine border. So do you think it\'s time to reconsider that
strategy? SHERMAN: Well[, I think that the [**strategy is really
working** very effectively]{.mark} to make the choice very clear to
Vladimir Putin. He can choose [diplomacy]{.mark}, dialogue and resolving
this [in a peaceful way, or]{.mark} he can go down the road of
determined deterrence and [consequences and
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} I hope he has not made the decision yet.
And what we are seeing, which often happens in situations like this, is
as we\'re getting closer and closer to his making that choice, [things
are in starker attention, and [we\'ve seen]{.mark} a flurry of
**[additional diplomacy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, as you pointed
out, there are forces of Russia surrounding Ukraine. Ukraine is no
threat to Russia. [I think the [international community has]{.mark} said
in [a **very solid voice**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that President
Putin should indeed endorse principles that he once agreed to, which was
sovereignty, territorial integrity, that countries get to choose their
own political future and their own alliances. [He has long supported
those. Now he appears to put those at risk.]{.underline} FLORIDO: Short
of invading Ukraine, Russia could do other things to destabilize the
country - cyberattacks, taking down the power grid or communication
systems. What have you told your counterparts in Moscow about how the
U.S. would respond to that kind of aggression? SHERMAN: I think that
[Russia knows that whatever they do, whether it is by a further
[invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}, by coercion or subversion, [using hybrid
attacks]{.mark}, that **[there will be
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if any troops go across the
border, they will be severe, solid, international and really bite. I
think that Putin needs to also understand that there is no question he
has the largest conventional military in Europe, but as many have said
to him, if indeed he goes forward with a further invasion of Ukraine,
there will be body bags returning to Moscow. It will not just be death
and destruction in Ukraine. It will have enormous consequences for
Russia. And although Putin may be able to take an advance in the first
couple of days, I have no doubt that Ukrainians will fight back, that
there will be an insurgency and that this will be a very bitter and
consequential conflict. FLORIDO: Ms. Sherman, any negotiation involves
concessions and sacrifices on both sides. What concessions are you and
what concessions is the U.S. offering during this negotiation? SHERMAN:
Well, I think that we responded to a non-paper - to \"treaties,\"
quote-unquote, that Russia sent to us with a non-paper of all of the
areas in which we could increase mutual security through reciprocal
actions. So we have yet to get a response from Moscow on that non-paper.
But there are many areas in which we can work together. Just this week,
there was an OSCE meeting on Tuesday, which I attended virtually, as did
my counterparts from all of the nations - I think 44 nations ended up
speaking - to embrace the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity, countries\' ability to make their own choices. OSCE has long
had a process to increase security for everyone in Europe, including
Russia. They have a seat at the table. [So there are many platforms,
[many **venues for** ]{.mark}**these
[discussions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We hope that President Putin makes
the right choice for himself, for the Russian people, for the security
of Europe, including Russia\'s security. FLORIDO: This isn\'t the first
time you\'ve negotiated with Russia. What is it like negotiating with
the Kremlin? SHERMAN: Russian negotiators are very smart. They\'re very
well-informed. They\'re very focused. But so are we. And what we have
that is so critical is solidarity, an alliance of many nations who
together are saying to President Putin that this is the direction in
which he should head for the security of Europe, which includes Russian
security. We hope he makes that choice. His other choice to in fact
further invade Ukraine will mean that there will be unbelievably
consequential sanctions, export controls, visa restrictions,
designations. A lot of harm will come to Russia. He doesn\'t need to
have that. He can make a choice to resolve this diplomatically and
peacefully. I hope he does. FLORIDO: In 2018, you wrote about your
negotiation strategy on the Iran deal and said that often [[in
negotiations]{.mark}, it\'s necessary to have a realistic sense of
one\'s own power]{.underline}. What is the U.S.\' power in this
negotiation? SHERMAN: [[The United States,]{.mark} along with our allies
and partners, [have **enormous power** in]{.mark} the [solidarity and
in]{.mark} that **[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as I\'ve been
describing in this conversation. I think the [**[Russians]{.mark} have
been [surprised]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} that
[solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} I think they\'ve been
surprised when President Biden says standing next to the German
chancellor that the next NS2 pipeline, which has been very
controversial, will end if Russia further invades Ukraine. And
Chancellor Scholz affirmed that Germany will be united in its response
with the United States. [We\'ve also slowed some forces and put others
on prepare to deploy orders to the eastern flank]{.underline} to ensure
that countries who feel most at risk, beyond Ukraine, of course, that
[we have troops there to send a message to Russia. And indeed, of
course, [we have **showed security assistance** to Ukraine,]{.mark}
including weapons that they can use to defend themselves. And a variety
of other countries have done exactly the same.]{.underline} FLORIDO:
Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, thank you for speaking with ALL
THINGS CONSIDERED. SHERMAN: Thank you very much.

This is [not the time for [negotiations in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But [[a **window of opportunity**]{.mark} will open and [we need to be
ready]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}when it does. It is not the time
because of the fresh outrages committed by Vladimir Putin and his troops
in Bucha, Mariupol and elsewhere. And it is not the time because we have
not yet reached what academics call a "mutually hurting stalemate":
Ukrainians are hurting and Russian soldiers are hurting, but Russia's
president is not yet hurting enough. British ministers are outcompeting
each other to expand Ukraine's war aims through aggressive rhetoric,
[[calling for complete victory]{.mark}. This may be satisfying but
it]{.underline} [[is irresponsible.]{.underline}]{.mark} So is crying
"appeasement" whenever negotiations are mentioned. We appear dangerously
close to being willing to fight to the last Ukrainian. This is not our
war, we are not fighting and we don't decide when it ends. [President
Volodymyr [**Zelensky** is]{.mark} far more [measured and]{.mark} is
**[clear the war cannot]{.mark}** be **[end]{.mark}**ed [**without
negotiations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last week he said: "Despite the
fact that they are destroying our bridges, I believe that not all
bridges have been destroyed yet." He cannot take risks with rhetoric
because he is responsible for Ukrainian lives. [We need to be prepared
for negotiations]{.underline} --- and to avoid the mistakes of the 2014
Minsk agreement. The steps agreed then were sensible but the Ukrainian
government was never going to be able to implement them in the sequence
in which they were to be taken. Currently, the most likely outcome is
that Putin will declare a ceasefire in place after managing to seize
more territory or he will carry on a grinding low-level war in the
Donbas. He will use this frozen conflict to apply continuing pressure on
Ukraine to prevent it from developing into a democratic and prosperous
country, free of corruption and moving in the direction of EU
membership. The Ukrainians should consider refusing such a ceasefire and
instead continue fighting and talking at the same time until Putin
agrees to withdraw to the pre-February 24 frontline. [We [need]{.mark}
to consider [a **new structure** for]{.mark} the [negotiations.]{.mark}
This conflict [**cannot be solved by Ukraine**
alone]{.mark}]{.underline}, nor should we return to the failed Normandy
format, with France and Germany at the table alongside the two
protagonists. [[The **US will have to use leverage**. Only
Washington]{.mark} can [provide]{.mark} what [Putin]{.mark} wants in
terms of [security]{.mark} architecture and a seat at the top table. The
security guarantees that Ukraine rightly demands will have to be
provided by America and its allies]{.underline}, and it is they who will
have to lift sanctions. It may be better therefore to think of this as a
triangular negotiation [[**involving Russia, Ukraine**]{.mark} and a
"Group of Friends" including **[the US,]{.mark}** EU **[and

The foreign ministers of [[Ukraine and Russia **are
meeting**]{.underline}]{.mark} on Thursday in the highest-level contacts
since Moscow's invasion --- but are expected to remain far apart on
steps to end the war between the two countries. Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba
is holding talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines
of a diplomatic forum in Turkey, their first meeting since Moscow
invaded its neighbour on February 24. Three rounds of talks in Belarus,
involving sets of political advisers from Moscow and Kyiv, have yielded
no long-term results. They have resulted primarily in attempts to
establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from Ukrainian
cities under heavy Russian bombardment. Kuleba on Wednesday said [[Kyiv
**wants a ceasefire**]{.mark}, the liberation of
territories]{.underline} under Russian control, and an end to the
catastrophic humanitarian conditions devastating large areas of the
country. [Kyiv has also signalled publicly that it may be [willing to
**compromise on**]{.mark} Russia's demand for Ukraine's **[future
neutrality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday
Ihor Zhovkva, deputy chief of staff in president Volodymyr Zelensky's
administration, said [Kyiv was [open to]{.mark} discussing
[**neutrality**]{.mark} if [in exchange]{.mark} it is [given security
guarantees]{.mark} by its neighbours.]{.underline} However, differences
on other issues including Russia's territorial claims on parts of
Ukraine appeared to make any agreement unlikely. Zelensky's Servant of
the People party on Tuesday said states such as the US, Turkey or
Ukraine's neighbours could act as guarantors, if their concrete
political, economic and military responsibilities in this capacity were
formalised. However, the party continued to uphold a commitment to
Ukraine joining Nato. "For its part, Russia must also legally state that
it recognises Ukrainian statehood and guarantees that it will not
threaten our state," the party added. Two people involved in
back-channel talks between Moscow and Kyiv said [Ukraine's [negotiators
have been **open to** ]{.mark}**offering [concessions]{.mark}** since
the start of the war]{.underline}, keen to stop the fighting. But
whereas Ukraine's delegation members had a direct line to Zelensky,
Russia's negotiators appeared to be working at least in part in the
dark, often appearing unaware what president Vladimir Putin wanted
beyond the most general terms, the people added. "The Ukrainians say,
'what do you want?' We say, 'we want Ukraine to declare neutrality!' The
Ukrainians say, 'great, what wording should we use?' And our guys have
no idea," one of the people said.

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," [Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[Zelensky said]{.mark}]{.underline} last week about Russia's president.
[["I **need to talk to Putin**]{.mark}. The world needs to talk to
Putin. [There is **no other way** to stop this
war."]{.mark}]{.underline} The [United States should heed this
plea]{.underline}. Ukraine's resistance to Russia's unprovoked and
illegal invasion has been both heroic and effective, but [its
**[situation is precarious]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For all
their flaws, Russia's armed forces may yet prevail in a prolonged
conflict, and there is still a real danger that much of Ukraine will
become a Russian vassal state under a puppet government. Moreover, even
if Ukraine can hold off Russian forces indefinitely, the prospect of
forcibly evicting them from its territory---particularly in the
south---is daunting. All the while, Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's
citizens ever more indiscriminately. James M. Acton Acton holds the
Jessica T. Mathews Chair and is co-director of the Nuclear Policy
Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But as
Zelensky's statement suggests, [[Ukraine's plan to end]{.mark} this [war
is]{.mark} probably [not to vanquish]{.mark} the invading [forces.
Rather]{.mark}, its goal appears to be to make the prospect of
continuing the war, and the occupation that could follow it,
exceptionally painful for Russia---so painful that Putin comes to view
[**a settlement agreement**]{.mark} that preserves Ukraine's
independence]{.underline} as the lesser of two evils. Putin may already
be feeling the pain. The United States believes that Putin embarked on
this war seeking to conquer most or all of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has
implicitly recognized Zelensky's government by demanding, in return for
an end to the war, that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge
Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as
independent states. If Ukrainian forces continue to perform well, Putin
will have to settle for still less and may even have to pay Ukraine
reparations. (Conversely, if Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin
will be able to drive a harder bargain.) Even in the best case, [[if
Zelensky wants]{.mark} a [negotiated settlement]{.mark}, he
[will]{.mark} likely [have to make]{.mark} significant [**concessions**
to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[as **he has
acknowledged**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Any such concessions will probably
be bitterly opposed by many in the United States and Europe. Ultimately,
though, it is not their call. The democratically elected government of
Ukraine should get to decide what price it is willing to pay for an end
to the slaughter of its citizens and the preservation of Ukraine's
existence as a sovereign state.

What is [[**Russia demanding** of NATO]{.mark} and the United

agreements]{.underline} that seek explicit, legally binding security
guarantees from the United States and NATO, respectively: Treaty [with
the United States]{.underline}. The draft treaty contains eight
articles, some of which call for tight restrictions on U.S. and NATO
political and military activities. Article 4 [calls for NATO [to **end
its eastward expansion**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} specifically,
deny future membership to ex-Soviet states, such as Ukraine. It would
also ban the United States from establishing bases in or cooperating
militarily with former Soviet states. Article 5 would [[block]{.mark}

shall refrain from deploying outside the party's national airspace or
territorial waters to areas where they could strike the other's

intermediate- and short-range, ground-launched missiles to their own
territories, and only in areas where they could not strike the other's
territory. Article 7 would [[block]{.mark} the parties [from deploying
nuclear weapons]{.mark} outside their respective territories and would

[several that [call for **dramatic military concessions** from the

divide NATO's Western and Eastern European membership. It would ban NATO
countries that were members of the alliance as of 1997 (a grouping that
excludes nearly all eastern members) from deploying military assets to
"any of the other states of Europe" in excess of what those members had
deployed by 1997. Such deployments could only take place "in exceptional
cases" and with Russia's consent. Article 5 would forbid the parties
from stationing intermediate- and short-range, ground-launched missiles
in areas that could strike the other parties. Article 6 would restrict
NATO "from any further enlargement," including admitting Ukraine.
Article 7 would ban NATO members from conducting any military activity
in Ukraine, as well as in other Eastern European states and those in
South Caucasus and Central Asia.

The United States owes billions of dollars in climate funding to
developing countries. But the war in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} is
delaying payments and [[slowing down]{.mark} U.S. [progress to
reduce]{.mark} **greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
that has leaders in low-lying and less wealthy nations feeling
frustrated and forgotten. \"Effectively, the [[U.S. owes]{.mark} the
rest [a climate debt ]{.mark}]{.underline}that needs to be paid,\" says
Mohamed Adow, the leader of PowerShift Africa, a coalition that
advocates for climate policies across the continent. \"Our continent is
effectively on the front line, and we are paying for the harms \[of\]
these climate pollutants.\" [In 2021, the U.S. promised to dramatically
cut greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} this decade, and send
long-overdue money to help developing countries transition to cleaner
energy and protect residents from rising seas, heat waves, food
instability and other dangerous climate effects. [[If the **U.S. follows
through**, it\'s]{.mark} still possible to [keep]{.mark} global
[temperatures from rising **catastrophically** and prevent]{.mark} tens
of millions of **[unnecessary deaths]{.mark},**]{.underline} according
to scientists and economists. But the [Russian [**invasion** of
Ukraine]{.mark} might [put]{.mark} many U.S. **[promises on
hold]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Months after renewing its pledges at the
international climate conference in Glasgow, the [[U.S. has not
passed]{.mark} any major climate
[legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Biden administration has
rolled back limits on domestic oil and gas drilling to cope with rising
energy prices. This spring, Congress allocated less than one third of
the international climate funding it pledged, even as it rushed billions
of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine. \"It\'s very disheartening
and worrisome,\" says Alejandra Lopez, a climate policy expert with
Transforma, an environmental think tank based in Colombia. \"I don\'t
mean to be disrespectful. \[The war\] is a major crisis,\" she says. But
\"even if this \[war\] is a very scary scenario, climate change
continues to be scarier.\" The [[lack of]{.mark} urgent [action by
the]{.mark} world\'s [**wealthiest economy**]{.mark} -- and the country
most culpable for climate change]{.underline} due to historical
greenhouse gas emissions -- is particularly frustrating for developing
countries that are suffering disproportionately from global warming. And
where every day of delay puts more people at risk. [**[By
2030]{.mark}**, climate change could push nearly [5.8 million people
in]{.mark}to **extreme [poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Latin America
and the Caribbean, according to the World Bank. The prognosis is even
more dire for island nations that are on track to be entirely underwater
by midcentury, and for cities in southeast Asia, Africa and the Middle
East where heat and rising seas will force millions of people to migrate
in order to survive. \"[We\'ve already lost so many lives to climate
change]{.underline},\" says Adow. \"Whether it\'s drought, whether it\'s
flood, whether it\'s cyclones, our continent has paid a huge price. This
is deeply unfair.\" The U.S. owes billions of dollars to developing
countries The U.S. owes billions of dollars in climate funding to less
wealthy nations. It\'s not charity, but something akin to reparations.
The idea is that countries that industrialized in the early and
mid-twentieth century became wealthy in part by burning oil, gas and
coal. Climate change driven by emissions from that early
industrialization poses the biggest threat to developing countries,
which have contributed far less to global warming. At global climate
talks, countries determined some of that [[wealth must]{.mark} now [be
used]{.mark} to build a cleaner global economy and protect low-income
nations from the effects of a hotter Earth.]{.underline} Under the 2015
Paris agreement, developed nations including the U.S., Canada,
Australia, Japan and European countries agreed to pay \$100 billion each
year to developing countries. \"This is the responsibility of developed
countries because their emissions are the primary driver of climate
change that the world is experiencing today, a disproportionate burden
of which is falling on developing countries,\" says Rachel Cleetus, an
international climate policy expert for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a science advocacy group in the U.S. But that \$100 billion
has never fully materialized. In 2018, the most recent year for which
there is complete data, contributions were slightly less than \$80
billion, in part because the U.S. contributed so little. Under the Obama
administration, the U.S. delivered just \$1 billion, which was about one
third of what it pledged under the Paris climate agreement. Then, the
Trump administration canceled U.S. membership in the agreement
altogether. The Biden administration said it would make good on past
promises by contributing more than \$11 billion per year to developing
countries by 2024. The first step toward that goal came last fall, when
the U.S. announced it would send \$3.1 billion to climate-vulnerable
developing nations. Then, in March, Congress allocated just \$1 billion
in international climate funding. \"When Biden came into office, he was
a huge source of hope,\" says Adow of PowerShift Africa. \"I would say
some of that hope was misplaced. He\'s talked a good game, but he
hasn\'t had much of substance. And now we see billions being pumped into
the war in Ukraine.\" In March, the U.S. sent more than \$13 billion to
Ukraine, and an additional \$40 billion in support is making its way
through Congress. A spokesperson for the State Department tells NPR that
U.S. international climate funding fell short this year, but that the
U.S. is nonetheless committed to increasing its climate support for
developing countries. The Russian invasion is influencing U.S. climate
policy in multiple ways There are many ways that the war in Ukraine is
delaying U.S. climate action, according to climate economists. The
[**Russian [invasion is contributing]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} global
economic **[inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which feeds opposition to
major infrastructure legislation stuck in Congress. That legislation
would help the U.S. meet its emissions goals by investing in electric
vehicles, solar and wind electricity and energy-efficient buildings.
[Higher [gas]{.mark}oline [prices]{.mark} also led the Biden
administration to [encourage]{.mark} U.S. fossil fuel [companies to
**produce more oil**]{.mark} and gas.]{.underline} And then there\'s the
problem of [mental bandwidth. \"[The biggest risk for]{.mark} U.S.
climate [action is]{.mark} just [a lack of **focus and
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" says Trevor Houser, a climate
analyst at the think tank Rhodium Group in the U.S. [\"Policymakers in
any country have limited attention, and the war in **[Ukraine]{.mark} is
a giant crisis** that [requires a lot]{.mark} of focus and
attention.\"]{.underline} Houser says the money going to Ukraine is not
being directly taken away from climate initiatives. But the focus on the
war and its effects is distracting U.S. policymakers from the urgent
work of reducing emissions and adapting to climate change around the
world. \"One of the big challenges of climate is that [[\[climate
change\] is always]{.mark} seen by policymakers as **[tomorrow\'s
issue]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline} Houser says. \"It\'s always the issue
you can come back to later.\" This week, United Nations Climate Envoy
Mark Carney warned that the war in Ukraine should not delay action to
rein in global warming, and cited the worsening effects of climate
change on people living in developing countries. This is a pivotal
moment for climate investment Developing countries feel the impacts of
the missing money acutely, because [[climate change]{.mark} is causing
[more severe]{.mark} floods, cyclones, droughts, wildfires and heat
waves [around the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.mark} is long-term change in the earth's overall
temperature,]{.underline} humidity[, precipitation]{.underline} pattern,
[etc. It [is a]{.mark} complex **[global environmental
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} faced by humanity these days [which has
led to **crop failure**, **disturbed natural ecosystem**, **scarcity of
freshwater supplies**]{.underline} and health issues [with some extreme
climatic conditions like rise in earth's surface temperature and sea
level]{.underline} (Beniston, 2003). [The [consequences]{.mark} of
climate change [have impacts on]{.mark}]{.underline} regional as well as
**[[global scales]{.underline}]{.mark}** which can be witnessed in
various earth's climate systems since the beginning of earth's
formatio[n]{.underline}. However, due to certain man- made activities,
climate change shoots up and causes warming of 0.1 °C per decade
observed over the last 50 years (Ramanathan et al., 1985).

After the industrial revolution, the human- caused climate drivers have
been increasing, and their effect dominates natural climate drivers.
Burning of fossil fuels and increased sophistication have disbalanced
the natural world. The human-induced environmental crisis is the
big-gest problem of these times, and this shoots up the climate changes.
The world population has already crossed the planetary boundary.
[According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]{.underline}
(IPCC, 2000; IPCC, 2001), [the increase in global mean
temperature]{.underline} is largely due to anthropogenic activities such
as industrialisation [which may likely increase global mean temperature
between **1.4 and 5.8 °C**]{.underline} by 2100. [This exceptional
change would result in **severe impacts** on the **hydrological**
system, **agriculture**, vegetation cover, wind pattern, **sea level,
melting glaciers** and **permafrost, ecosystem disturbances** and other
related processes]{.underline}. The report further highlights that
coastal areas and developing countries, including India, will be more
prone to these changes as they have a high emission rate and
comparatively high percentage of population having lower economic
conditions.

One of the possible reasons behind the present-day climate scenario is
failure of policy to reduce greenhouse gas emission and uncontrolled
developments without sustainability goals. The policies being made by
the international agencies such as the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol are not
implemented properly and thus, are insufficient to deal with climate
change effectively. This challenge can be addressed with sustainability
goals like water conservation, dependence on renewable and efficient
energy sources, forest and biodiversity conservation, etc. Due to the
poor economic conditions and lack of awareness among the citizens,
developing nations like India are likely to face more climate challenges
and opt migrations as adaptation strategies.

This chapter summarises the basics about climate changes (e.g. natural
vs human-induced climate change) and [consequences of climate change
which [induces **extreme events**]{.mark} such as cloud burst leading
food, landslides, avalanches, etc.]{.underline} Some long-term changes
like increase in earth temperature leading to [melting of ice cover,
[sea level rise]{.mark} causing to coastal area food]{.underline}, etc.
are also discussed. We also [elaborate on the impact on **cropping
pattern, [biodiversity loss]{.mark}** as well as **human
survival**]{.underline} and poor economic condition of the country [due
to climate change.]{.underline}

Natural Versus Human-Induced Climate Change

Earth is continuously receiving solar radiation in which \~29% is
radiated back into space, 23% absorbed in the atmosphere and the
remaining 48% absorbed at the surface (Wald & Basics, 2018). This
[**radiation** energy is **absorbed by** the **land, water** and other
components of **atmosphere** and then **reradiates back** in the form of
heat. This heat energy **warms the atmosphere**. The mixing of gases
**traps** some **energy** and obstructs them escaping directly into
space. Due to this, the **atmospheric blanket gets warm** and maintains
optimum temperature to support life called as greenhouse gas (GHG)
effect.]{.underline} Figure 10.1 represents the driver of climate change
and their effects.

[Earth surface emits **radiation** in the form of molecules **having
various vibration frequencies, some having** in the range of **infrared
radiation. When** this **IR** radiation **interacts with** the **GHGs**,
the molecular **vibrations are enhanced** because there is a match
between the wavelength of the light and the vibrational frequency of the
molecule. This makes vibration **more vigorous** and in turn **heating
the surrounding air**]{.underline} (Harren & Cristescu, 2019).
[**These** molecules **also emit IR radiation** in all directions, some
of which reaches earth's surface and **causes** the **greenhouse
effect**]{.underline} (Earle, n.d.).

According to the law of thermodynamics, the total energy absorbed by the
earth should be equal to the amount radiated back to space. But in
actual conditions, it does not happen; some amount of solar radiation
remains entrapped within the atmosphere. Therefore, the difference
between the total incoming and outgoing radiation is known as planet's
radiative forcing (Iacono et al., 2008). This climate forcing factor
will change the climate system. When the radiation absorbed is higher
than the radiation emitted, the planet warms up and is called positive
radiative forcing; on the other hand, when outgoing radiation is greater
than the incoming radiation, the planet cools and is called negative
radiative forcing.

The sun is the main component which impacts longest-term natural
forcing. Life and metabolic activities have evolved and changed the
atmospheric condition and amount of CO2 and CH4 -- greenhouse gases
(GHGs) -- over geological time scale. Both these [**GHGs contribute to**
the **temperature balance**, and its percentage makes the planet cool
enough to make it habitable. But **increased** amount of **CO2** in the
atmosphere from fossil fuel burning and increased carbon footprints push
climate forcing]{.underline} (Bennington, 2009). [This CO2 **traps
heat** from the atmosphere and **radiates it back** which **causes
warming.**]{.underline}

During volcanic eruption, lava and exploding rock fragments evolved with
particulate matter and gases. Sulphur dioxide and CO2 are the most
important among them. Sulphur dioxide is an aerosol that reflects
incoming solar radiation and has a net cooling effect (Earle, n.d.). Its
half-life is short and doesn't typically contribute to longer- term
climate change (Charlson et al., 1992). However, volcanic CO2 emissions
can contribute to climate warming. It is widely believed that the
**[[catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}** end-Permian
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (at 250 Ma) **[resulted from
warming]{.underline}** initiated due to eruption of the massive Siberian
Traps over a period of at least a million years (Liu et al., 2020).

[The **increased warming** changes [vegetation patterns]{.mark};
contributes to the **[melting of snow]{.mark}, ice** and **permafrost**;
causes sea level rise, **[ocean acidification]{.mark}** which reduces
the solubility of CO2 in seawater, **coral bleaching** and **toxic
habitat**; and has a number of other minor effects that are not noticed
significantly]{.underline} (Waldbusser & Salisbury, 2014). [Most of
these **[changes contribute to more warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**Melting of snow** and glaciers **acts as strong positive feedback**
because **frozen soil contains** trapped organic **matter** that is
**converted to CO2 and CH4**]{.underline} (Khvorostyanov et al., 2008).
On the other hand, increased CO2 can cause more vegetation growth and
thus, reduces the warming effect (negative feedback) (Foley et al.,
2005). [**Recent [studies suggest]{.mark}** that **glaciers** and
[permafrost]{.mark} are [**melting** at]{.mark} faster [rates which
**contribute to positive feedback**]{.mark} and warming
climate]{.underline} (Adger & Winkels, 2014a, b)

[Climate Change Impacts]{.underline}

[Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture Sector]{.underline}

[The [agriculture]{.mark} sector is very [sensitive to]{.mark} **adverse
effects of [climate change]{.mark}** [because it]{.mark} **directly
[affects]{.mark}** the **[output]{.mark}** because [disturbance]{.mark}
in weather patterns like **cold wave, heat storm** and **irregular
monsoon** [can hamper]{.mark} the [yield]{.mark}]{.underline} (Masud et
al., 2017; IPCC, 2007). [It results in the **decline of socio-economic
condition** of farmers. Therefore farmers]{.underline} of developing
nations like India [are **more vulnerable** and facing many difficulties
with climate change because they are more or less **dependent on
monsoon** for irrigation, etc.,]{.underline} which put extra pressure on
them (Verchot et al., 2007; IPCC, 2007). [The impacts of climate change
are **more severe to** the small-scale **farmers** than the large-scale
because climate change **drastically reduces agricultural productivity**
which adversely **affect the rural per capita** income and poverty
levels]{.underline} (Esham & Garforth, 2013). [The **impact** of climate
change **on ocean** and **other ecosystems**]{.underline} is presented
in Fig. 10.2. According to Redfern et al. (2012), [climate change
**induces** a **[decline in]{.mark} world rice
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} which led to increase the poverty
level of the farmers. The agriculture sector suffers from the following:
[(i) reduced agricultural productivity; **(ii) [food scarcity]{.mark}**;
(iii) [increased temperature]{.mark} of air and water; **(iv) [economic
crisis]{.mark}; (v) [reduced power generation]{.mark}**; and (vi) change
in cropping pattern due to change in precipitation, temperature, cloud
cover and [increased **carbon**]{.mark} **dioxide
[concentration]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baker & Allen, 1993).

[Impact of Climate Change over Polar Regions]{.underline}

[One of the [worst scenarios]{.mark} of climate change can be seen in
the Arctic where the glaciers are melting at an alarming rate resulting
in the **[shrinking of cryosphere cover]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
According to Comiso et al. (2008) on 14 September 2007, the extent and
area of the ice cover were 4.1 × 106 km2 and 3.6 × 106 km2,
respectively, which are 24% and 27% less than the previous record of 5.4
× 106 km2 and 4.9 × 106 km2 which was on 21 September 2005. This data is
37% and [**38% less** than the **climatological averages**]{.underline}
(Comiso et al., 2008). The year 2018 was recorded as the warmest (Cheng
et al., 2019). [The **temperature of air above** the Arctic **Ocean** in
September 2018 was **1.5 °C higher than the Arctic land**]{.underline}
(Kumar et al., 2020). [The Arctic sea generally melts during summer and
again frozen during winter, but now its **freezing speed is lesser**
than the melting because **summer exists for more time** than the winter
and due to which **permafrost not getting** enough **time to freeze**
again properly]{.underline} (Abraham et al., 2013). [The devastating
[melting]{.mark} of **permafrost** [results in]{.mark} the **[increased
temperature]{.mark} of the earth** as the **energy stored** in the form
of ice or snow **comes out** and there is additional warming. **The
[Arctic is warming]{.mark}** roughly **[twice as
fast]{.mark}**]{.underline} as the rest of the world (Taylor et al.,
2017).

In the Arctic, polar bears are most threatened. The female bears face
lots of challenges in building their den in autumn and feeding their
cubs in spring on the sea ice surfaces because of decreased density of
sea ice (Kovacs et al., 2011). Their main prey sources are seals which
are also suffering from climate changes as they have no ice land to
raise their young ones. Due to unavailability of sufficient foods, they
are feeding on lesser amounts than they previously did, and consequently
their population is declining day by day. It is estimated that its
population would decline by 30% by the middle of this century (Derocher,
2004).

[The [devastating **effects**]{.mark} of **climate change** can be
clearly seen [on]{.mark} the **[global food supplies, water scarcity,
conflict, pandemics]{.mark} and [global instability]{.mark}**. These all
speed up the migration of the human population to suitable
place.]{.underline}

[Dynamics of **Climate Change, Disasters**]{.underline}, and
Displacement in the Global South

Climate change is a natural process, but [climate scientists across the
globe are of the opinion that the rate of [climate change]{.mark} has
[increased]{.mark} as a [result of human
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this change has [increased the
probability of displacement due to associated disasters by 60% compared
to that in the 1970s. Climate change, as a driver of mobility, has both
short-term and long-term variables. Short-term or fast-onset events are
natural disasters like **floods, storms, heat and cold** **waves**, and
**droughts** whereas long-term or slow-onset events include changes in
temperature and precipitation variables over the years, changes in terms
of rise or fall in averages, and changes in frequency and intensity of
weather events]{.underline} (Bedarff & Jackobeit, 2017; and Abel et al.,
2019). This makes the study of dynamics between displacement and climate
change very complex (Fig. 9.4 showing variables of climate change- and
disaster-induced displacement in 2019).

Natural disasters have traditionally been associated with sudden,
forced, short distance, and temporary displacements, but with [climate
change-[induced]{.mark} slow-onset changes like **[rise in sea
level]{.mark}**, salt water intrusion, coastal **[erosion]{.mark}**,
increased rainfall, and **temperature unpredictability**, gradual,
long-term, long-distance **displacements** have also been on a rise in
the last 50 years. From over 20 million, climate change-induced
displacements between 2008 and 2018]{.underline}, future projections by
2050 vary between 25 and 500 million. [In spite of the variability of
numbers, it is certain that climate change-induced disasters will become
a major displacement force in the coming times]{.underline} (Gemenne,
2011; IPCC, 2012; and Wilkinson et al., 2016).

Although [it is a [threat to the globe]{.mark} as a whole, in
particular, climate change has become an **[existential
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the Global South as majority of its
[countries are still developing, have high density of
population]{.underline}, and are [located in vulnerable and low-lying
areas]{.underline}. Moreover, these nations have a [low level of
economic development]{.underline} which further [enhances their exposure
and vulnerability to post-disaster challenges. It is not merely a
problem for the future but a present reality that is **[altering]{.mark}
the** very [nature of]{.mark} global [weather events]{.mark} and
disasters and **causing [extreme devastation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Its
impacts and mechanisms vary from place to place based on geography; and
related losses and impacts are directly influenced topography, location,
socio-political structure, and economic development. However, [it is
obvious that the **[Global South]{.mark}**, owing to the lag in
development and research in area of climate change, [has]{.mark} an
inherent **[vulnerability]{.mark} to** the **associated
disasters**]{.underline}. In this context, this paper reviews [major
disasters and displacements induced by climate change (i.e.,
**droughts**, floods, tsunami, **sea level rise**)]{.underline} by
reflecting upon case studies of different countries and regions in the
Global South.

[Drought and Heat Stress]{.underline}

[**[Droughts]{.mark}** have been **increasing in
severity**,]{.underline} the reason of which cannot be attributed to
natural variability alone[. Changes in [rainfall, runoff]{.mark}, and
[rise in temperature]{.mark} (which [affects]{.mark} the
[groundwater]{.mark} table, **soil [moisture]{.mark}**, etc.) have
changed the characteristics of droughts, which have [become]{.mark} more
**[frequent and intense]{.mark}**. Due to complexity in identifying
different types of droughts and its slow-onset nature, it becomes
**difficult to monitor**]{.underline} displacements triggered by it.
Also, it is difficult to discern between voluntary and involuntary
movement caused due to drought. For example, in 2016, a drought year,
Telangana experienced 1.4 million displacements, but as this region
experiences seasonal migration, it became difficult to categorize this
in absence of a strict monitoring policy, in spite of the number of
migrants being a lot more than usual (GRID-IDMC, 2019). [Droughts
experienced in Syria, Somalia, Iraq, East Mediterranean, and Turkey from
2007 to 2017 have shown increased inter-linkages with climate change.
[Data suggests with]{.mark} **98% [certainty]{.mark}** that these
**[droughts were drier]{.mark}** than the last 500 years [and]{.mark}
are **[linked with climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover,
majority of forced migrants from Iraq and Afghanistan [point toward
**shortage of water**]{.underline} and increased dry conditions as the
reason for their displacement and inability to return home. For example,
the result of four [consecutive **years of below average rainfall** and
**high** average **temperatures** in North-West **Afghanistan caused
severe drought** in 2018]{.underline} and forced over 370,000 people to
migrate, more than 71% of which have no intention of returning even if
government assistance is granted (Gleick, 2017; and GRID- IDMC, 2019).
Pointing out a direct relationship between intention to move and
ultimate displacement, a sample survey on people of Malaysia, Indonesia,
and the Philippines concluded that [slow-onset events like **gradual
[rise in]{.mark}** average **[temperature]{.mark}** and increase in
[heat stress]{.mark} that can [lead to]{.mark} **drought, [food
shortage]{.mark}**, etc.]{.underline} are responsible for gradual
displacement of people (as more than 60% of people showed a desire to
move, with nearly 98% claiming the reason as heat stress). Majority of
this movement is internal (to a more suitable region) but the more
affluent prefer to move across the borders. Although the immediate cause
of movement is heat stress, other factors like desire for better living
standard, etc. also play a role, and in this context, a better
methodology to quantify the same needs to be formulated (Zander et al.,
2019).

[Floods and [Cyclonic Storms]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Cyclonic storms]{.underline} occur in tropical and sub- tropical
regions, and their [**linkages with climate change** and rising
temperature have been **studied by various scientific bodies**. The
IPCC]{.underline} (2012) [has pointed out the [increasing
**severity**]{.mark} **and intensity of cyclones**, hurricanes, and
typhoons as the [result of **increasing sea**]{.mark} **surface
[temperature]{.mark}** [and **rise in sea level**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In 2016 alone, 13 million people were displaced as a result of the
damage and losses caused by it. Countries like India and Bangladesh
experiencing 3--5 cyclones every year face maximum damages in spite of
good early warning systems due to low preparedness level to
post-disaster response. Majority of people thus displaced are sent to
temporary shelters and have to settle ultimately in poor, informal
settlements, thus enhancing the adverse impact of internal displacement
(Heslin et al., 2019). [This became evident with nearly **2.7 million
displacements** in India in 2018 after recurring floods (Kerala) and
three cyclonic storms]{.underline} (Titli, Phethai, and Gaja) [which
**aggravated the losses** of displaced and **increased** their
**vulnerability and poverty**]{.underline}. Government of the Republic
of Suriname (2015) has projected the possibility of displacement of the
country's entire population by 2020 based on its own climate change
models and has pointed out its dilemma of deciding whether to focus on
building adaptation in the current location or to prepare for eventual
forced displacement (Thomas & Benjamin, 2017). [In addition to cyclonic
storms, increased flooding caused by changes in rainfall patterns has
become a trigger for displacement in the Global South]{.underline}.
Floods in Niger and Benue rivers of Nigeria displaced 600,000 people
from 34 out of its 36 states (i.e., 80% of the country) in 2018. This is
in addition to the already displaced two million people as a result of
ongoing conflict with Boko Haram and struggle for access to resources.
Poor urban planning and unplanned development along the exposed river
banks and flood plains have made this African nation vulnerable to
frequent floods and forced migration (GRID-IDMC, 2019). The quantitative
household survey on intention, mobility, adaptive capacity, and exposure
to disaster risks in coastal cities of Bangladesh formulated a
displacement model till 2100 (based on coastal flooding and denudation
risks), which [pointed toward a directly proportional relationship
between disaster stress, mobility, and climate chang]{.underline}e
(Adams & Kay, 2019).

[Tsunami]{.underline}

In 2007 and 2009, tsunami destroyed parts of Solomon islands and Samoa,
respectively, as a result of which, thousands of people were forced to
move both temporarily and permanently to either relocate uphill or to
settle inland (Tabe, 2019). The 2004 tsunami led to government- funded
displacement of 20,000 people from smaller to larger islands in the
Pacific Ocean. Although less than half of those displaced returned to
their places of origin within 2 years, the rest couldn't due to damage
to islands and habitability conditions.

[Sea Level Rise]{.underline}

[There has been an average **rise of 3.2 mm of sea level** every year
due to rise in global temperature and **[melting of ice
caps]{.mark}**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2012). Millions of people living in
coastal regions and their settlements are at the most risk particularly
those located at low elevated zones and densely populated coastal
cities. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific and Indian
Ocean face a [**high degree of threat** from **climate change** and
**sea level rise** due to their low elevation level]{.underline}. For
example, people of Papua New Guinea's Carteret Islands have been forced
to displace to Bougainville Island (Connell, 2016; McLeman, 2018). Both
short- and long-term disasters have induced displacement in the region
since historical times, particularly in atoll islands like Tuvalu, Fiji,
Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, etc. where settlements are
constructed within a few meter distance from the coast and thus, floods,
tsunami, storm surges, etc. force population to displace. The general
trend has been of internal displacement within larger islands due to
short- term rapid disasters like floods, tsunami, hurricanes, etc.,
whereas [long-term disasters like **sea level rise** [create
**food**]{.mark}, habitation, and health
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} and force people to seek shelter across
national borders. In the longer run, these [**islands** are **expected
to submerge completely** as a result of sea level rise]{.underline}, and
their entire populations will have to be relocated (Bank & Fröhlich,
2018). [Additional challenge of excessive rainfall, [**increased CO2
emissions** caus]{.mark}ing **[ocean acidification]{.mark}**,
etc.]{.underline} have also led to displacement to the extent that 94%
of the households in Kiribati have experienced natural disasters, with
80% of them being rise in sea level (Heslin et al., 2019).

Another example is Bangladesh which is expected to lose 17% of its
cultivable land, and 30 million of its population are expected to be
displaced as a result of 1 meter rise in sea level according to IPCC
report, 2012. Being a densely populated nation with a large coastline,
it gets hit by cyclones, storm surges, excessive rainfall, floods, etc.
on a regular basis. According to Refugee and Migrants Movement Research
Unit, over 16 million people are expected to be displaced in Bangladesh
by 2050 as a result of climate- induced disasters (Siddiqui & Mahmood,
2015; and Khanam, 2018).

### Impact\-\--Ukraine\-\--Economy\-\--2NC

#### Ukraine has slowed growth and raised inflation\-\--spillover means global disruption

The conflict is a major blow to the global economy that will hurt growth
and raise prices. Beyond the suffering and humanitarian crisis from
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[the]{.mark} **entire [global
economy]{.mark}** [will feel the effects]{.mark} of slower growth and
faster inflation.]{.underline} Impacts will flow through three main
channels. One, higher prices for commodities like food and energy will
push up inflation further, in turn eroding the value of incomes and
weighing on demand. Two, neighboring economies in particular will
grapple with disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances as well as
an historic surge in refugee flows. And three, reduced business
confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices,
tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital
outflows from emerging markets. [[Russia and Ukraine are major]{.mark}
commodities [producers]{.mark}, and [disruptions]{.mark} have
[caused]{.mark} global **[prices to soar]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
especially for oil and natural gas. Food costs have jumped, with wheat,
for which Ukraine and Russia make up 30 percent of global exports,
reaching a record. Beyond global spillovers, countries with direct
trade, tourism, and financial exposures will feel additional pressures.
[[**Economies reliant** on]{.mark} oil [imports will see]{.mark} wider
fiscal and trade [deficits and]{.mark} more [inflation]{.mark}
pressure]{.underline}, though some exporters such as those in the Middle
East and Africa may benefit from higher prices. [Steeper [price
increases]{.mark} for food and fuel may [spur]{.mark} a greater risk of
[unrest]{.mark} in some regions]{.underline}, from Sub-Saharan Africa
and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia, while food
insecurity is likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the
Middle East. Gauging these reverberations is hard, but we already see
our growth forecasts as likely to be revised down next month when we
will offer a fuller picture in our World Economic Outlook and regional
assessments. Longer term, [the [war]{.mark} may [**fundamentally alter
the global economic**]{.mark} and geopolitical
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} should energy trade shift, supply chains
reconfigure, payment networks fragment, and countries rethink reserve
currency holdings. Increased [geopolitical [tension further]{.mark}
raises risks of **[economic fragmentation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
especially for trade and technology. Europe The toll is already immense
in Ukraine. [Unprecedented [sanctions]{.mark} on Russia will
[impair]{.mark} financial intermediation and [trade,]{.mark} inevitably
[causing a deep recession]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}there. The
ruble's depreciation is fueling inflation, further diminishing living
standards for the population. [Energy is the main spillover
channel]{.underline} for Europe as Russia is a critical source of
natural gas imports. Wider [[supply-chain disruptions]{.mark} may also
be [consequential]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} These effects will
[fuel inflation and [slow]{.mark} the [recovery]{.mark} from the
pandemic]{.underline}. Eastern Europe will see rising financing costs
and a refugee surge. It has absorbed most of the 3 million people who
recently fled Ukraine, United Nations data show. European governments
also may confront fiscal pressures from additional spending on energy
security and defense budgets. While foreign exposures to plunging
Russian assets are modest by global standards, pressures on emerging
markets may grow should investors seek safer havens. Similarly, most
European banks have modest and manageable direct exposures to Russia.
Caucasus and Central Asia Beyond Europe, these neighboring nations will
feel greater consequences from Russia's recession and the sanctions.
Close trade and payment-system links will curb trade, remittances,
investment, and tourism, adversely affecting economic growth, inflation,
and external and fiscal accounts. While commodity exporters should
benefit from higher international prices, they face the risk of reduced
energy exports if sanctions extend to pipelines through Russia. Middle
East and North Africa [Major [ripple effects]{.mark} from higher food
and energy prices and tighter global financial conditions are
likely]{.underline}. Egypt, for example, imports about 80 percent of its
wheat from Russia and Ukraine. And, as a popular tourist destination for
both, it will also see visitor spending shrink. Policies to contain
inflation, such as raising government subsidies, could pressure already
weak fiscal accounts. In addition, worsening external financing
conditions may spur capital outflows and add to growth headwinds for
countries with elevated debt levels and large financing needs. [Rising
prices may [**raise social tensions**]{.mark} in some countries, such as
those with weak social safety nets, few job opportunities, limited
fiscal space, [and **unpopular governments**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Sub-Saharan Africa Just as the continent was gradually recovering from
the pandemic, this crisis threatens that progress. Many countries in the
region are particularly vulnerable to the war's effects, specifically
because of higher energy and food prices, reduced tourism, and potential
difficulty accessing international capital markets. The conflict comes
when most countries have minimal policy space to counter the effects of
the shock. This is likely to intensify socio-economic pressures, public
debt vulnerability, and scarring from the pandemic that was already
confronting millions of households and businesses. Record wheat prices
are particularly concerning for a region that imports around 85 percent
of its supplies, one-third of which comes from Russia or Ukraine.
Western Hemisphere [[Food and energy prices]{.mark} are the main channel
for **[spillovers,]{.mark} which [will be substantial]{.mark}** in some
cases]{.underline}. High commodity prices are likely to significantly
quicken inflation for Latin America and the Caribbean, which already
faces an 8 percent average annual rate across five of the largest
economies: Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Central banks may
have to further defend inflation-fighting credibility. Growth effects of
costly commodities vary. Higher oil prices hurt Central American and
Caribbean importers, while exporters of oil, copper, iron ore, corn,
wheat, and metals can charge more for their products and mitigate the
impact on growth. Financial conditions remain relatively favorable, but
intensifying conflict may cause global financial distress that, with
tighter domestic monetary policy, will weigh on growth. The United
States has few ties to Ukraine and Russia, diluting direct effects, but
inflation was already at a four-decade high before the war boosted
commodity prices. That means prices may keep rising as the Federal
Reserve starts raising interest rates. Asia and the Pacific Spillovers
from Russia are likely limited given the lack of close economic ties,
but slower growth in Europe and the global economy will take a heavy
toll on major exporters. The biggest effects on current accounts will be
in the petroleum importers of ASEAN economies, India, and frontier
economies including some Pacific Islands. This could be amplified by
declining tourism for nations reliant on Russian visits. For China,
immediate effects should be smaller because fiscal stimulus will support
this year's 5.5 percent growth goal and Russia buys a relatively small
amount of its exports. Still, commodity prices and weakening demand in
big export markets add to challenges. Spillovers are similar for Japan
and Korea, where new oil subsidies may ease impacts. Higher energy
prices will raise India's inflation, already at the top of the central
bank's target range. Asia's food-price pressures should be eased by
local production and more reliance on rice than wheat. Costly food and
energy imports will boost consumer prices, though subsidies and price
caps for fuel, food and fertilizer may ease the immediate impact---but
with fiscal costs. Global Shocks [The [**consequences** of]{.mark}
Russia's [war on Ukraine have]{.mark} already [shaken]{.mark} not just
those nations but also the region and **[the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and point to the importance of a
global safety net and regional arrangements in place to buffer
economies. "We live in a more shock-prone world," IMF Managing Director
Kristalina Georgieva recently told reporters at a briefing in
Washington. "And we need the strength of the collective to deal with
shocks to come." While some effects may not fully come into focus for
many years, there are already clear signs that the war and resulting
jump in costs for essential commodities will make it harder for
policymakers in some countries to strike the delicate balance between
containing inflation and supporting the economic recovery from the
pandemic.

### Impact\-\--Ukraine\-\--Laundry List\-\--2NC

#### Prolonged Russian-NATO conflict creates a [nothing left to lose mindset]{.underline} in Russia -- cyberattacks, assassinations, refugee crisis, sanction retaliations, economic sabotage, expanding military front

Thomas **Graham, 22** (3/8/22; cofounder of the Russian, East European,
and Eurasian studies program at Yale University, professor on
U.S.-Russian relations and Russian foreign policy, as well as
cybersecurity and counterterrorism, PhD in Political Science from

<https://www.cfr.org/report/preventing-wider-european-conflict)//> LVL

The Russian military intervention in Ukraine could easily escalate into
a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and
further west into Europe. Although Russia, wielding massive military
superiority, might overrun Ukrainian forces in a matter of weeks,
stabilizing and pacifying the country will likely prove to be a grueling
and costly affair. A significant Ukrainian resistance movement is almost
certain to emerge. With sustained [[Western
support]{.underline}]{.mark}, it could [[prolong the warfare]{.mark} for
months, if not years]{.underline}. The first wave of sanctions that
Washington has levied on Moscow could be followed by others in a
continuing effort to raise the cost to Moscow and force it to yield. A
negotiated end to the conflict will not come easily, since Washington
has framed it in Manichean terms as a world historical struggle between
the democratic West and the aggressive, malevolent, and autocratic
Russia. [Anything short of "victory" will be decried as surrender or
appeasement in the West, while [Russia will not capitulate on a matter
it considers vital to its security]{.mark} and prosperity. The [stage
is]{.mark} thus [set for an escalating cycle of
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Moscow seeking to stamp out a
Ukrainian insurgency and retaliate against Western efforts to stop
Russia's advance. [[If the conflict wears on, Moscow]{.mark} could be
[increasingly tempted to expand]{.mark} its [military operations]{.mark}
further into Europe to achieve its goals.]{.underline} As a first
option, [[Russia could]{.mark} intensify [pressure]{.mark} on
[states]{.mark} neighboring Ukraine (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Romania, and
Slovakia) [that]{.mark} could [provide safe havens for
insurgents]{.mark} or the inevitable government-in-exile.]{.underline}
It will doubtless reinforce its military presence in Kaliningrad and
elsewhere in the Baltics and patrol the Baltic Sea more aggressively.
[It [could deploy hybrid-war tactics---cyberattacks, disinformation
campaigns, and economic sabotage---to destabilize countries]{.mark}
providing safe havens]{.underline}. If those actions did not
sufficiently degrade the resistance, [Moscow could even launch direct
attacks on insurgents]{.underline} and their supporters outside Ukraine,
as well as attempt to assassinate leading figures in the
government-in-exile, akin to the attacks it has made on Chechen rebels
and Federal Security Service (FSB) defectors in Europe in recent years.
[Such steps could, at a minimum, [draw frontline NATO states directly
into the military conflict with Russia, obligating the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} other [allies to come to their
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. To build up further pressure,
[[Moscow]{.mark} could [also "weaponize]{.mark}" the [inevitable refugee
flows into neighboring states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Refugees, who would
likely number in the millions, would move first into unoccupied
Ukrainian territory but eventually into adjacent European states, which
have shown little tolerance for outsiders. [[Moscow]{.mark} could [use
harsh military]{.mark} and police [tactics that would increase the
number of refugees and]{.mark} seek to [guide them into countries where
they would create]{.mark} the greatest [socioeconomic
stress]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Moldova. In addition, Moscow could
increase the tension by pushing Belarusian President Aleksandr
Lukashenko to again seek to push thousands of Middle Eastern migrants
across the borders into Poland and Lithuania. That could lead to border
clashes, as it almost did on occasion last fall, with Russia supporting
its ally, Belarus, and NATO states coming to the defense of allies under
attack. [A second option Moscow [could pursue is opening up a second
front in the Balkans]{.mark}]{.underline}. In recent years, Russia has
taken a number of destabilizing actions in the region, seeking to weaken
Montenegro after its accession to NATO, exacerbate tensions between
Serbs and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and undermine relations
between Serbia and Kosovo. As it fought in Ukraine, Russia could
encourage Republika Srpska leader Milorad Dodik to press for separation
from Bosnia, threatening to reignite the bitter wars of the 1990s in the
former Yugoslavia. [A [Balkans war would complicate]{.mark} the
[security calculus of all countries in the region, as well as that of
Germany and France]{.mark}, which have significant interests there. [To
quell]{.mark} the [fighting, NATO countries]{.mark} could decide [to use
military force]{.mark} against Bosnian Serb forces enjoying Russian
support.]{.underline} A third, riskier, option would be to directly
attack the United States, the country that Moscow believes is
orchestrating a larger anti-Russia campaign. [[In response to Western
sanctions]{.mark} designed to crater Russia's financial system and
undermine critical industries, [Moscow could launch]{.mark} major
[cyberattacks against U.S. critical infra]{.mark}structure. [If]{.mark}
a [cyberattack]{.mark} were to [take down a major financial institution
or corrupt its records, the ensuing havoc in U.S. markets could prompt
overwhelming public and congressional pressure for]{.mark} a [forceful
response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Ukraine\-\--Food\-\--2NC

#### Ukraine war collapsed grain infrastructure\-\--continued bans from Europe threaten food security

Since the invasion, much of [[Ukraine's current]{.mark} export [**grain

because of [damage to]{.mark} rail [infrastructure, closed ports
and]{.mark} Russian [blockades]{.mark} in the Black Sea.]{.underline}
Those blockages also mean there won't be sufficient storage available
when the 2022 harvest comes in, according to the WFP. The shortfall
could have [[**devastating consequences** for many]{.mark} countries who
[relied on Ukraine]{.mark} and Russia [for]{.mark} as much as [**half of
their wheat**]{.mark} imports]{.underline} from 2016 to 2020, including
Egypt, who recently made a deal with India to help replace some of the

longer delays at ports and drive up shipping costs. \"Russia's reckless

next year,\" Torero told Reuters. Western [[sanctions]{.mark} on

export curbs to protect its own farmers as global prices soared due to
strong demand and high energy prices. [[Russia]{.mark} and China

#### Our food systems are terminally [unsustainable]{.underline} -- they will cause [extinction]{.underline} unless we act [now]{.underline}

//smarx, AZG\]

[Studies show [our food system is
**unsustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [it will not
endure]{.underline}. We will only embrace the solutions if we first
[recognise the **serious dilemma** we have created with our economic
success.]{.underline}

[The Climate Change Commission]{.underline} has [received over 15,000
replies]{.underline} to its Draft Advice Report regarding how NZ can
deal with climate change. This level of response bodes well for how many
of us are engaged with this important issue.

[But what about all the other **existential threats** that we continue
to face which are **not getting attention?**]{.underline} In point of
fact, [there is not a single mainstream human designed system we rely on
daily that is **sustainable.**]{.underline}

[If something is unsustainable it means it **will not
last**]{.underline}. [If [none of the systems we rely on]{.mark} daily
[are sustainable]{.mark}, what are the implications for our wellbeing if
**they cannot endure?**]{.underline}

[Take our most basic energy needs -- food production. [It takes **more
energy to produce**]{.mark} our [food **than the food
provides**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Think about that for a moment. **[Our
food system is unsustainable]{.underline}**; it will not endure. [This
conclusion was reached by]{.underline} both [a United Nations study,
and]{.underline} another [by the World Business Council for Social
Development.]{.underline}

[Our food production was not always so energy intensive]{.underline},
but [with]{.underline} the current use of [heavy equipment, [heavy
artificial fertilizers]{.mark}, wide spread irrigation, [global
transport systems]{.mark}, storage and refrigeration, distribution [and
advertising]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we have [developed a]{.mark} highly
complex, and **[energy intensive]{.mark} food
[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In doing so [we]{.underline} have
[created an unsustainable way of meeting our most basic energy
needs.]{.underline}

Our use of the word sustainable has been distorted [to imply
that]{.underline} sustainability is a continuum, and that [with
continuous [tech]{.mark}nological advances we can increase our level of
sustainability]{.underline}. But this [[is a]{.underline} **[gross
misunderstanding]{.underline}**. [Being sustainable
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [more like [being pregnant, you]{.mark} either
[are or you aren't]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yes, [[one unsustainable
way]{.mark} of doing things [can be less unsustainable]{.mark} than
another]{.underline}, but **[[both remain
unsustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Both continue damaging ecosystems
and]{.underline} **[neither can endure]{.underline}**. [We have to [do
better than]{.mark} **simply [being less
unsustainable.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The critical threshold is whether or not the system can regenerate
itself]{.underline}. For example, if a food system can provide more
energy than the energy required to produce it. That is the only way we
can do things other than grow more food.

If we look at the macro picture of our human systems (food, transport,
construction, energy, housing, medicine, etc) and their cumulative
ecological impacts, their unsustainability becomes dramatically evident.
[[Researchers]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[developed a variety of
method]{.mark}ologie[s]{.mark} for monitoring our]{.underline}
collective [ecological impact, and it is not]{.underline} a
[pretty]{.underline} picture [no matter]{.underline} which of
[the]{.underline} several [methodologies]{.underline} you look at.

The Ecological Footprint measure, for example, tracks how much natural
systems produce annually in terms of food, food and fibre, and how much
we collectively consume. It also identifies how much waste natural
systems can safely absorb, and tracks how much we emit. In both cases,
[our production/consumption and wastes all exceed natures' capacity to
continue functioning]{.underline} over an extended time.

On a global basis [[we use]{.mark} almost [twice what the earth
produces]{.mark} or can absorb.]{.underline}

While we could sustainably live off the abundance nature provides
annually, instead [[we]{.mark} **gobble that up** and continue
[eat]{.mark}ing into [the natural "capital"]{.mark}]{.underline} that
produces that abundance. We not only fell new timber, but also old
growth; we not only harvest young fish, but also the more mature and
fertile fish; we pour more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it
and the oceans can safely absorb. It's like first using up the interest
from your financial savings and then dipping into your savings as well.
Eventually you end up with neither interest nor savings.

Of course, [highly developed nations like NZ consume and pollute much
more than the global average]{.underline}. NZ's Ecological Footprint is
4.4 global hectares\[1\] per capita, whereas the global fair share is
only 1.6; we are exceeding our global fair share by 275 percent. Do we
really care for fairness and social justice? Do we even appreciate how
our lifestyles impact people in poor countries?

Another macro look at humanity's impact on nature is simply in terms of
the amount of natural stuff we consume each year. Research indicates
[our global material footprint is **90 billion tons** of natural
resources]{.underline} (both renewable and non-renewable) each year, or
11 tons for every man, woman and child. Many [researchers suggest this
level is **significantly beyond any sustainable level**]{.underline} of
material use.

From an equity perspective, high income nations, like NZ, use more than
twice the sustainable levels of materials, and 10 times the level of low
income nations. Do we really need to consume so much?

Another way of looking at our collective impact on nature is the concept
of planetary boundaries, those major ecosystems that maintain and
sustain us. Again, the data are clear. [We are exceeding the biophysical
limits of several major boundaries]{.underline}, [some areas being at
**greater risk than climate.**]{.underline}

This picture of our collective impact on nature is not new. The Limits
to Growth study from the 1970's issued a warning. Subsequent updates
confirm the conclusions of the original projections.

[[Despite]{.mark} this **growing body of [empirical evidence]{.mark}**
[we]{.mark} continue to rely on an economic system that
[require]{.mark}s]{.underline} ever more renewable and non-renewable
[[resources.]{.underline} [We]{.underline}]{.mark} have unwittingly
[[constructed an **intricate trap**]{.mark} for ourselves.]{.underline}
[We]{.underline} either [continue our consumption and waste dispersion,
or we reduce our demands on nature]{.underline} (both in terms of using
it up at unprecedented rates and emitting more wastes than it can
absorb). But [if we reduce our use of resources our economy
falters]{.underline}. [And if we keep growing our economy, nature
falters]{.underline}. **[Either way [we are seriously
compromised]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [That is [the **existential
human dilemma**]{.mark}]{.underline} [which is]{.underline} **[[defining
our]{.mark} moment in [history]{.mark}]{.underline}**[;]{.mark} [climate
change is only one example.]{.underline}

The evidence regarding climate change was clear some 50 years ago. [We
now have evidence of even **broader existential threats** to human
wellbeing.]{.underline} We must [begin taking in this growing body of
evidence a whole lot quicker]{.underline} than we did about a climate
crisis. **[Attractive [solutions are available.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
But we will only embrace them if we first recognise the serious dilemma
we have created with our economic success.

#### Food production has [existential]{.underline} implications -- it [compounds]{.underline} warming, diseases, and ecosystem [destruction]{.underline}

Though a lot of progress has been made to decrease poverty and increase
food production for a growing population, [the number of people
[suffering]{.mark} from hunger [has **grown steadily**]{.mark} **over
the last five years**]{.underline}. In 2020, more than 811 million
people worldwide were hungry, up by 161 million \[1\]. [By 2030,
projections are that [656.8 million]{.mark} people [will be
hungry]{.mark}. This is 6% higher than]{.underline} the number of hungry
people in [2015]{.underline}, the year 193 governments committed to zero
hunger in the context of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.

The current [food systems]{.underline} that produce more than enough
food for all in the world, still [leave 9.9 percent of people globally
hungry.]{.underline} [[The system is]{.underline}]{.mark} edging out the
time-proven indigenous wisdom that has nourished both the planet and the
people, with [[extractive industrial]{.mark} models [that add
profit]{.mark} and convenience [for the privileged **at the cost**
of]{.mark} workers, [the land]{.mark}s, and the waters.]{.underline}

[[Food is **essential for life**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **binds us
together**]{.underline} as families and communities, and sharing food is
an expression of our love, a way we care for each other. But [food is
being reduced to a commodity, and [the systems]{.mark}]{.underline} that
serve it in the current form, [are [lead]{.mark}ing [us to
an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[existential crisis.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[Food [production]{.mark} now [takes up **40 percent of**]{.mark} **the
earth\'s [land]{.mark} surface**]{.underline}\[2\].
[[Agriculture]{.mark} also [makes use of **70 percent of**]{.mark} **all
available [water]{.mark} resources**]{.underline}\[3\]. [Human activity
is **primarily [responsible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for the decline
by]{.underline} **[60 percent of]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[global
[vertebrate species]{.mark}]{.underline}**---fish, birds, mammals,
amphibians, and reptiles over the last 40 years\[4\]. [Agriculture and
food [production]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[contributes]{.mark} about
**[one-fifth of]{.mark} all greenhouse** gas [emissions.]{.mark} Global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline} attributable to human beings [continued
its relentless march, [causing]{.mark} increased occurrences of
**[high-impact]{.mark} events**]{.underline}, [including [**extreme
heat,** wildfires and floods, and **record-breaking hurricane
seasons**]{.mark}, affecting millions of people. Despite the [massive
impact of food production on the earth]{.mark}, one-third of the food
produced for human consumption is wasted globally]{.underline}. This
amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year\[5\]. In addition,
[increasing]{.underline} sedentary lifestyles and [diets high in
sugars]{.underline}, saturated and transfats, low-fiber foods and
high-sugar drinks, [and [a high intake of]{.mark} fast food and
ultra-[processed foods contribute to]{.mark} non-communicable
[diseases]{.mark} and other health problems [precipitating a global
health crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} \[6\] [and creating]{.underline} with
[it **[mass ecosystem destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. All this is
[[compounded by]{.mark} the threats to human health, food security and
economic [stability]{.mark} posed [by]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19
pandemic.]{.underline}

[[Cultivating]{.mark}, fishing, buying food, cooking, [and
eating]{.mark}]{.underline} are actions that [[have **deeply
existential**]{.underline}]{.mark}, political, social, economic, and
spiritual [[implications]{.underline}]{.mark}. What we eat, what we
drink, [where we source it from, how we cultivate]{.underline} or rear
livestock, and the policies that guide and govern our food systems, [all
have a **profound influence** on the environment, the society, and our
own health]{.underline}. We are challenged to live with our eyes open,
speak truth to power and walk gently on this earth.

### Impact\-\--Ukraine\-\--Trade\-\--2NC

#### Ending the conflict is key to securing US interests and global trade networks

Stephen M. **Walt, 22** (3/29/22; columnist at Foreign Policy, professor
of international relations at Harvard University, PhD in political
science; "The Realist Case for a Ukraine Peace Deal"; Foreign Policy

All the attention on the fighting is understandable, but [what matters
in the end is how the conflict is resolved. It [may be]{.mark}
emotionally [satisfying to proclaim]{.mark} that [the only
acceptable]{.mark} [outcome is Russia's capitulation]{.mark}, regime
change in Moscow, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's prosecution for
war crimes, [but]{.mark} none of those outcomes is likely.]{.underline}
[Making these goals our war aim [is]{.mark} also [a good way to prolong
the fighting and raise the risk of escalation]{.mark} even higher. If we
care about Ukraine, our immediate goal should be to end the war before
even more damage is done]{.underline}. There are thoughtful pieces by
Thomas Graham and Rajan Menon, Michael O'Hanlon, Anatol Lieven, and
others that begin to wrestle with this difficult topic, but they all
recognize that getting there will not be easy. Moreover, [the ultimate
[goal should be conflict resolution]{.mark}---[not just an end to the
fighting but a political arrangement]{.mark} that makes a replay later
on less likely.]{.underline} You might think that a realist would regard
conflict resolution as a naive and idealistic notion popular among
woolly-headed academics and largely divorced from real-world concerns.
After all, doesn't realism emphasize the competitive tendencies that are
hard-wired into an anarchic political order? Yes, but it's a mistake to
think that realists see no interest in resolving conflicts when one can.
Properly understood, there is a hard-nosed realist case for resolving
conflicts whenever possible. Let me lay it out for you. [The most
obvious reason for great powers to try to [resolve]{.mark} ongoing
[conflicts]{.mark} is to [remove existing problems from]{.mark} the
[current foreign-policy agenda.]{.mark} Realists recognize that new
troubles are always lurking around the next corner, and [every]{.mark}
problem or [conflict]{.mark} that [you]{.mark} can [shut down now is
something you won't need to worry about when]{.mark} a [new crisis
erupts.]{.mark}]{.underline} The nuclear deal with Iran is an obvious
case in point. When it was in effect, the United States did not have to
worry very much about Iran's nuclear potential and didn't have to devote
a lot of time or bandwidth to negotiating a new agreement. So long as
Iran remained in compliance (and the International Atomic Energy Agency
repeatedly certified that it was), the problem could be left on the back
burner. By leaving the agreement, however, then-U.S. President Donald
Trump put Iran's nuclear program back near the top of America's
foreign-policy agenda. Not only did his blunder fuel regional violence
in ways that undermined U.S. interests, but leaving the nuclear deal
forced the Biden administration to devote time, energy, and bandwidth to
negotiating a new agreement to reverse Iran's renewed progress toward a
bomb. I'll bet President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and the rest of their team
wishes they didn't have to spend a minute on this issue right now. [A
second reason to [resolve conflicts is to protect allies]{.mark} and
friends who are [involved in a regional dispute]{.mark} or likely to get
drawn into one. [By making them more secure, they will be in a better
position to help]{.mark} you [in other ways. It's a win-win, especially
for]{.mark} a country such as [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, [which has partners in many places and defines its
interests broadly.]{.mark}]{.underline} Third, by definition, [resolving
conflicts reduces the risk of unwanted escalation]{.underline}.
[[When]{.mark} any [war is underway]{.mark}, there is always a chance
that [third parties will enter it voluntarily or get drawn in]{.mark} as
the protagonists try to prosecute the conflict more
effectively]{.underline}. The Congo wars in Africa eventually involved
nearly all the states bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
the Vietnam War expanded into Laos and Cambodia (with especially
horrific effects on the latter); and the Iran-Iraq War led to attacks on
foreign oil tankers and eventually led the United States and others to
respond militarily. Stopping the fighting made that problem disappear
virtually overnight. Moreover, [[wars invariably produce]{.mark} a lot
of nasty [unintended consequences, even for]{.mark} the
[winners]{.mark}.]{.underline} Supporting the Afghan mujaheddin against
the Soviet Union during the 1980s may have seemed like a great idea at
the time, and one can argue that it was worth it to bring the Soviet
empire down. But it also sowed the seeds of the terrorist movements that
attacked Americans from the 1990s onward and eventually provoked the
United States into the long and disastrous global war on terrorism. And
it certainly did nothing positive for the people of
[[Afghanistan]{.mark}, who have [endured]{.mark} more than [40 years
of]{.mark} near-constant [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Instead of
fueling]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}, maybe [doing more to settle it
way back then would have left everyone---including the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates[---better
off.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fourth, [helping to stop an ongoing war is an
ideal way for a great power to demonstrate its influence and its ability
to work for the greater good]{.underline}. In the first decade of the
20th century, for example, President Theodore Roosevelt's successful
mediation of the Russo-Japanese War enhanced America's status as a newly
influential actor on the world stage. Seventy years later, President
Jimmy Carter's stewardship of the Camp David Accords and
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty had similar effects. By contrast, [the
[repeated failure to broker a final Israeli-Palestinian peace
deal]{.mark} under the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations
[undermined America's image]{.mark} as a competent and objective
mediator.]{.underline} From this perspective, we may one day look back
on Russia's war in Ukraine as a giant missed opportunity for Chinese
President Xi Jinping. Imagine the prestige China might have garnered if
Xi stepped in and got the Russians and Ukrainians to come to terms. Not
only would this action have reinforced Chinese aspirations to be the
leading global power of the 21st century, but it would also have
underscored its stated commitment to the principle of national
sovereignty. Beijing could have boasted to others that the war had
demonstrated that decadent and declining great powers such as the United
States, its European allies, and Russia simply couldn't handle their
disagreements without fighting, while China's approach to world affairs
could deliver peace. Xi's failure to seize this opportunity suggests he
simply cannot admit that backing Putin so strongly over the past several
years was a bad bet. If so, he is displaying the same self-defeating
rigidity that helped bring the war about in the first place. Fifth, [a
[world where conflict and war are endemic is a world where trade and
investment cannot flow as safely or as freely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just
look at what is happening now, as the war in Ukraine accelerates the
retreat from globalization that was already underway. As my colleague
Dani Rodrik told the New York Times, the war has "probably put a nail in
the coffin of hyperglobalization." Liberals often argue that economic
interdependence promotes peace---and there is some evidence for that
proposition---but it may be even more accurate to say that [peace
facilitates interdependence]{.underline}. Countries at war are generally
not attractive investment opportunities, and they must divert resources
away from enhancing their citizens' lives and pour them onto the
battlefield instead. Realism's emphasis on the conflictive elements of
world affairs does not preclude it from seeing the material benefits of
more integrated global economy, and reaping these benefits requires a
world with less war. Last but by no means least, [resolving conflicts is
desirable because it reduces human suffering]{.underline} and enhances
human dignity. Nothing in the realist approach to foreign policy says
these things are unimportant, even if states often ignore such concerns
when vital interests are at stake. But realists see this situation as
part of the tragedy of power politics and welcome practical steps to
mitigate it. Conflict resolution is one of the most obvious.

This [[disparity in firepower is driving Ukrainian casualties beyond
what]{.underline}]{.mark} we believe [[it can
sustain]{.underline}]{.mark}, with up to 200 soldiers reportedly killed
each day and around 500 wounded. The toll on Kyiv's equipment is just as
devastating: Most of the Soviet-era equipment Ukraine possessed at the
beginning of the war has been destroyed, and it has run out of entire
categories of ammunition. **[[No military can sustain those kinds of
losses]{.underline}]{.mark}** and continue to offer effective
resistance---as evidenced by Ukraine's recent loss of several towns and
villages to the Russian invaders and near-encirclement on the Donbas
front. [[Policies in Kyiv and Washington]{.mark} seem to [ignore]{.mark}
these [battlefield realities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last week, Zelensky
reiterated his plans to regain all Ukrainian territory lost to Russia
since the first invasion in 2014---currently about 20 percent of
Ukraine. On the prospects for a negotiated settlement, he added one day
later that "there is no time for talking" to Russia. U.S. Deputy Defense
Secretary Kathleen Hicks recently said the Pentagon is "well equipped"
to support Ukraine for five, 10, or 20 years into the future. Yet our
own substantial experience deployed in combat leads us to wonder if
Ukraine can hold out for five to 10 months, much less one or two
decades. While there is still time, and Kyiv still controls 80 percent
of its territory, [a [change in U.S. policy would provide a chance to
save Ukrainian lives and prevent further territorial
losses.]{.mark}]{.underline} At minimum, [the [Biden]{.mark}
administration [should de-emphasize its goals of weakening Russia and
instead **prioritize diplomacy**, help]{.mark}ing Kyiv and Moscow find a
[negotiate]{.mark}d [end to the war]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is in the
U.S. national interest to prevent the war from escalating in Ukraine or
expanding beyond it[. [Avoiding the risk of]{.mark} direct [U.S.-Russian
or NATO-Russian confrontation is vital because of]{.mark} the [dire
global consequences of]{.mark} a [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
world is already at a greater risk of nuclear war than at any time since
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.

Anyone trying to figure out how this plays out should study the
literature on economic sanctions too. On the one hand, the financial
sanctions imposed this past week are a reminder of America's
extraordinary ability to "weaponize interdependence," especially when
the country acts in concert with other important economic powers. On the
other hand, a [substantial amount of serious [scholarship shows]{.mark}
that [economic sanctions rarely compel states to alter course]{.mark}
quickly]{.underline}. [The [failure of]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration's "[maximum pressure" campaign against Iran is another
obvious case]{.mark} in point. [Ruling elites]{.mark} are typically
[insulated from]{.mark} the [immediate consequences of sanctions, and
Putin knew sanctions would be imposed and]{.mark} clearly
[believed]{.mark} the **[geopolitical interests at stake were worth the

**[military activity]{.mark} in Eastern Europe**]{.underline} and
Ukraine, [part of a wish list of [security guarantees it wants to
negotiate]{.mark} with the West.]{.underline}

[Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are
essential for lowering tensions in Europe]{.underline} and defusing a
crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of
sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the
border. Russia has denied planning an invasion.

The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on
future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled
out.

Others would imply the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe and
the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the
Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the
Soviet Union.

In Washington, a senior administration official said the United States
was prepared to discuss the proposals but added: \"That said, there are
some things in those documents that the Russians know are
unacceptable.\"

The official said Washington would respond some time next week with more
concrete proposals on the format of any talks.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Washington would talk to its
allies. \"We will not compromise the key principles on which European
security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide
their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference,\"
she said.

NATO diplomats told Reuters that Russia cannot have a veto on further
expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own
military posture.

\"Russia is not a member of NATO and doesn\'t decide on matters related
to NATO,\" Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said.

Ukraine\'s foreign ministry said Kyiv had an \"exclusive sovereign
right\" to run its own foreign policy, and only it and NATO could
determine the relationship between them, including the question of
Ukrainian membership.

[It urged Moscow to re-engage with a peace process in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}, where some 15,000 people have been killed in a
seven-year conflict between Ukrainian government troops and
Russian-backed separatists.

Some Western political analysts suggested Russia was knowingly
presenting unrealistic demands which it knew would not be met to provide
a diplomatic distraction while maintaining military pressure on Ukraine.

\"Something is very wrong with this picture, the pol(itical) side
appears to be a smokescreen,\" Michael Kofman, a Russia specialist at
Virginia-based research organization CNA, wrote on Twitter.

Sam Greene, professor of Russian politics at King\'s College London,
said President Vladimir Putin was \"drawing a line around the
post-Soviet space and planting a \'keep out\' sign\".

\"It\'s not meant to be a treaty: it\'s a declaration,\" he said. \"But
that doesn't necessarily mean this is a prelude to war. It's a
justification for keeping Moscow's hair-trigger stance, in order to keep
Washington and others off balance.\"

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky said last week about Russia's president. "I need to talk to
Putin. [[The world needs to **talk** to Putin]{.mark}. There is no other
way to stop this war]{.underline}."

[The United States should heed this plea]{.underline}. Ukraine's
resistance to Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion has been both
heroic and effective, but its situation is precarious. [For all their
flaws, Russia's armed forces may yet prevail in a prolonged conflict,
and there is still a real danger that much of Ukraine will become a
Russian vassal state under a puppet government. Moreover, even if
Ukraine can hold off Russian forces indefinitely, the prospect of
forcibly evicting them from its territory---particularly in the
south---is daunting. All the while, Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's
citizens ever more indiscriminately]{.underline}.

But as Zelensky's statement suggests, Ukraine's plan to end this war is
probably not to vanquish the invading forces. Rather, its goal appears
to be to make the prospect of continuing the war, and the occupation
that could follow it, exceptionally painful for Russia---so painful that
Putin comes to view a settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine's
independence as the lesser of two evils.

Putin may already be feeling the pain. The United States believes that
Putin embarked on this war seeking to conquer most or all of Ukraine.
Today, Moscow has implicitly recognized Zelensky's government by
demanding, in return for an end to the war, that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian
neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize
Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. If Ukrainian forces continue
to perform well, Putin will have to settle for still less and may even
have to pay Ukraine reparations. (Conversely, if Russian forces achieve
breakthroughs, Putin will be able to drive a harder bargain.)

[Even in the best case,]{.underline} if Zelensky [wants a **[negotiated
settlement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, he will likely have to make
significant concessions to Russia---as he has acknowledged. Any such
concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United
States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The
democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what
price it is willing to pay for an end to the slaughter of its citizens
and the preservation of Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state.

The United States and its allies should support Zelensky in any
diplomatic course he pursues. Indeed, he cannot end the war without
them. Economic sanctions on Russia strengthen his hand at the
negotiating table by raising the costs to Russia of continuing to fight.
By the same token, however, it is virtually inconceivable that Russia
would agree to a settlement without sanctions relief. For this reason,
the United States and its allies must be prepared to lift
sanctions---including on Russia's central bank---if Russia and Ukraine
negotiate and implement a settlement agreement.

[To date, [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark} have **[sent]{.mark}** out **[mixed
messages]{.mark}**]{.underline} about sanctions relief. [[U.S.]{.mark}
Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland **[indicated]{.mark}** an
**[openness]{.mark}** to it.]{.underline} By contrast, French Finance
Minister Bruno Le Maire has declared "economic and financial war on
Russia" with the goal of causing "the collapse of the Russian economy."
In a similar vein, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that
"the purpose of the sanctions is to debilitate the Russian economy."
[This [**ambiguity** is **dangerous**]{.mark} because it [risks
**obscuring**]{.mark} the [existence of an **off-ramp** for
Putin]{.mark} and could thus **[prolong]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}**
and [increase]{.mark} the]{.underline} small but real **[[chance of

[U.S. President Joe Biden]{.underline} should clear up the confusion by
stating publicly that the purpose of sanctions is to end the war, not to
remove the government of Russia. In coordination with Kyiv, [he should
dispatch a trusted lieutenant---such as Secretary of State Antony
Blinken or CIA Director William Burns---to try to [negotiate with
Russia. Washington and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} could also [explore

[What does Russia want and [why is it]{.mark} so [hard for]{.mark} the
[U.S. to meet Moscow partway]{.mark}?]{.underline} Here\'s a guide.

1\. Russia wants a guarantee Ukraine can never join NATO

Russia\'s main demand is a commitment from NATO to end its further
expansion into former Soviet republics --- especially Ukraine. Russia
wants NATO to rescind a 2008 promise that Ukraine could someday join the
defense alliance. Many observers see it as a distant prospect that
Ukraine could join NATO because it doesn\'t meet membership
requirements. But Moscow doesn\'t see it that way. \"We don\'t trust the
other side,\" Russia\'s chief negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov, said after bilateral talks with the U.S. finished. [\"We
[need]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof,
legally binding** guarantees. Not assurances]{.mark}. Not
[safeguards]{.mark}. Guarantees. [With]{.mark} all [the
words]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[[\'shall,
must\']{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [everything that should be put
in.\"]{.underline}

Russia\'s reasoning: President Vladimir Putin views Ukraine as an
extension of what he calls \"historical Russia\" --- a part of the
Russian Empire and Soviet Union, and within Moscow\'s \"sphere of
influence\" today. The threat of Ukraine\'s westward turn after a street
revolution ousted the country\'s pro-Russian president in 2014 was the
driving force behind Russia\'s annexation of Crimea later that year.
Ukraine\'s desire to join the Western alliance also led to Russia\'s
sponsorship of separatists in the country\'s eastern Donbas region ---
in effect sabotaging its path to membership by fueling a civil war.

#### Verbal assurances fail\-\--[actions]{.underline} and [binding guarantees]{.underline} are key.

**Litvinova '21** \[Dasha; 12-21-2021; Journalist for AP NEWS; "Putin

[The [Russia]{.mark}n president on Tuesday reiterated his demand for
guarantees from the U.S.]{.underline} and its allies that NATO will not
expand eastward, [[**blaming** the West for \"tensions]{.mark} that are
building up in Europe]{.underline}.\"

Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s speech at a meeting with Russia\'s
top military brass came just days after Moscow submitted draft security
documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other
former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance's military
deployments in Central and Eastern Europe -- bold ultimatums that are
almost certain to be rejected.

The demands -- contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a
security agreement between Moscow and NATO -- were drafted amid soaring
tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stoked fears
of a possible invasion. Russia has denied it has plans to attack its
neighbor but pressed for legal guarantees that would rule out NATO
expansion and weapons deployment there.

Putin charged Tuesday that if U.S. and NATO missile systems appear in
Ukraine, it will take those missiles only minutes to reach Moscow.

\"For us, it is the most serious challenge -- a challenge to our
security,\" he said, adding that this is why the [[Kremlin needs]{.mark}
\"**long-term**, **[legally binding guarantees]{.mark}**\" from the
West, [as opposed to \"**verbal assurances**]{.mark}, **words** and
**promises**\" that Moscow **can\'t trust**.]{.underline}

Putin noted that NATO has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while
giving assurances that Russia's worries were groundless.

\"What is happening now, tensions that are building up in Europe, is
their (U.S. and NATO\'s) fault every step of the way,\" the Russian
leader said. \"Russia has been forced to respond at every step. The
situation kept worsening and worsening, deteriorating and deteriorating.
And here we are today, in a situation when we\'re forced to resolve it
somehow.\"

Russia's relations with the U.S. sank to post-Cold War lows after it
annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 -- gaining control
over long coastlines of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov -- and backed
a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that still controls territory
there. Tensions reignited in recent weeks after Moscow massed tens of
thousands of troops near Ukraine's border.

Putin has pressed the West for guarantees that NATO will not expand to
Ukraine or deploy its forces there and raised the issue during a video
call with U.S. President Biden two weeks ago.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu charged Tuesday that more than
120 staff of U.S. private military companies are currently operating in
two villages in war-torn eastern Ukraine, training Ukrainian troops and
setting up firing positions in residential buildings and different
facilities.

Putin said the U.S. \"should understand we have nowhere to retreat.\"

\"What they are now trying to do and plan to do at Ukraine's territory,
it's not thousands of kilometers away, it's happening right at the
doorstep of our house,\" he said.

[Putin added that [Moscow **hopes** \"constructive, **meaningful talks**
with]{.mark} a **visible [end result]{.mark}** -- and within a certain
time frame -- that would [ensure **equal security**]{.mark} for
all.\"]{.underline}

[\"Armed conflicts, bloodshed is not our choice, and we don't want such
developments. We want to [**resolve issues** by **political** and
**diplomatic means**]{.mark},\" Putin said.]{.underline}

THE WAR in [[Ukraine is]{.mark} the most [dangerous international
conflict]{.mark} since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.]{.underline}
Understanding its root causes is essential if we are to prevent it from
getting worse and, instead, to find a way to bring it to a close. There
is no question that Vladimir Putin started the war and is responsible
for how it is being waged. But why he did so is another matter. T[he
mainstream view in the West is that he is an irrational, out-of-touch
aggressor]{.underline} bent on creating a greater Russia in the mould of
the former Soviet Union. Thus, he alone bears full responsibility for
the Ukraine crisis. [But that story is wrong. [The West]{.mark}, and
[especially America, is]{.mark} principally [responsible for the
crisis]{.mark} which began in February 2014. [It has]{.mark} now [turned
into a war that]{.mark} not only [threatens to destroy Ukraine, but
also]{.mark} has the potential [to escalate into a **nuclear war**
between Russia and NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} The trouble over Ukraine
actually started at NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008, when George
W. [[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [administration [pushed]{.mark} the
[alliance to announce]{.mark} that [Ukraine and Georgia "will become
members]{.mark}"]{.underline}. [[Russian leaders responded]{.mark}
immediately [with outrage]{.mark}, [characterising this]{.mark} decision
[as an existential threat to Russia]{.mark} and vowing to thwart
it]{.underline}. According to a respected Russian journalist, Mr Putin
"flew into a rage" and warned that "if Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so
without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply fall apart."
[[America ignored Moscow's red line]{.mark}, however, [and]{.mark}
pushed forward to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's
border]{.underline}. That strategy included two other elements: bringing
Ukraine closer to the eu and making it a pro-American democracy. [These
efforts [eventually sparked]{.mark} hostilities in February 2014, after
[an uprising]{.mark} (which was supported by America) caused Ukraine's
pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, to flee the country. [In
response, Russia took Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil
war]{.mark} that broke out in the Donbas region of eastern
Ukraine.]{.underline} The next major confrontation came in December 2021
and led directly to [the [current war]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The main
[cause was]{.mark} that [Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The process started in December
2017, when the [[Trump]{.mark} administration decided to [sell]{.mark}
Kyiv "[defensive weapons]{.mark}".]{.underline} What counts as
"defensive" is hardly clear-cut, however, and [these [weapons]{.mark}
certainly [looked offensive to Moscow]{.mark} and its allies in the
Donbas region]{.underline}. [[Other NATO countries]{.mark} got in on the
act, [shipping weapons to Ukraine, training its armed forces]{.mark}
[and allowing it to participate in joint]{.mark} air and naval
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In July 2021, Ukraine and America
co-hosted a major naval exercise in the Black Sea region involving
navies from 32 countries.]{.underline} Operation Sea Breeze almost
provoked Russia to fire at a British naval destroyer that deliberately
entered what Russia considers its territorial waters. The [[links
between Ukraine and America]{.mark} continued [growing under]{.mark} the
[Biden]{.mark} administration]{.underline}. This commitment is reflected
throughout an important document---the
"us-[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} Charter on Strategic
Partnership"---that was [[signed]{.underline}]{.mark} in November by
Antony Blinken, America's secretary of state, and Dmytro Kuleba, his
Ukrainian counterpart. The aim was to "underscore ... a commitment to
Ukraine's implementation of the deep and comprehensive reforms necessary
for [[full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}." The document explicitly builds on
"the commitments made to strengthen the Ukraine-u.s. strategic
partnership by Presidents Zelensky and Biden," and also emphasises that
the two countries will be guided by the "2008 Bucharest Summit
Declaration." [Unsurprisingly, [Moscow found this evolving situation
intolerable and began mobilising its army]{.mark} on Ukraine's
border]{.underline} last spring to signal its resolve to Washington. But
it had no effect, as the Biden administration continued to move closer
to Ukraine. This led Russia to precipitate a full-blown diplomatic
stand-off in December. As Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, put
it: "We reached our boiling point." [[Russia demanded a written
guarantee that Ukraine would never become a part of NATO and that the
alliance remove]{.mark} the [military assets]{.mark} it had deployed in
eastern Europe since 1997]{.underline}. The subsequent negotiations
failed, as Mr Blinken made clear: "There is no change. There will be no
change." A month later Mr Putin launched [an invasion of Ukraine to
eliminate the threat he saw from NATO]{.underline}. This interpretation
of events is at odds with the prevailing mantra in the West, which
portrays NATO expansion as irrelevant to the Ukraine crisis, blaming
instead Mr Putin's expansionist goals. According to a recent NATO
document sent to Russian leaders, "NATO is a defensive Alliance and
poses no threat to Russia." The available evidence contradicts these
claims. For starters[, the [issue at hand is not what Western leaders
say NATO's purpose or intentions are; it is how Moscow sees NATO's
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr [[Putin]{.mark} surely [knows]{.mark}
that [the costs of conquering and occupying large amounts of territory
in eastern Europe would be prohibitive for
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As he once put it, "Whoever does
not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no
brain." His beliefs about the tight bonds between Russia and Ukraine
notwithstanding, trying to take back all of Ukraine would be like trying
to swallow a porcupine. Furthermore, Russian policymakers---including Mr
Putin---have said hardly anything about conquering new territory to
recreate the Soviet Union or build a greater Russia. Rather, since the
2008 Bucharest summit [[Russian leaders]{.mark} have repeatedly said
that they [view Ukraine joining NATO as an existential threat]{.mark}
that must be prevented]{.underline}. As Mr Lavrov noted in January, "the
key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward."
Tellingly, Western leaders rarely described Russia as a military threat
to Europe before 2014. As America's former ambassador to Moscow Michael
McFaul notes, Mr Putin's seizure of Crimea was not planned for long; it
was an impulsive move in response to the coup that overthrew Ukraine's
pro-Russian leader. In fact, until then, NATO expansion was aimed at
turning all of Europe into a giant zone of peace, not containing a
dangerous Russia. Once the crisis started, however, American and
European policymakers could not admit they had provoked it by trying to
integrate Ukraine into the West. They declared the real source of the
problem was Russia's revanchism and its desire to dominate if not
conquer Ukraine. My story about the conflict's causes should not be
controversial, given that many [[prominent American foreign-policy
experts]{.mark} have [warned against NATO expansion]{.mark} since the
late 1990s.]{.underline} America's secretary of defence at the time of
the Bucharest summit, Robert Gates, recognised that "[[trying to
bring]{.mark} Georgia and [Ukraine into NATO was]{.mark} truly
[overreaching]{.mark}]{.underline}". Indeed, at that summit, both the
German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas
Sarkozy, were opposed to moving forward on NATO membership for Ukraine
because they feared it would infuriate Russia. The upshot of my
interpretation is that [we are in an extremely [dangerous situation, and
Western policy is exacerbating]{.mark} these
[risks.]{.mark}]{.underline} For Russia's leaders, what happens in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has little to do with their imperial ambitions
being thwarted; it is about dealing with what [they regard as a direct
threat to Russia's future.]{.underline} Mr Putin may have misjudged
Russia's military capabilities, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian
resistance and the scope and speed of the Western response, but one
should never underestimate how ruthless great powers can be when they
believe they are in dire straits. America and its allies, however, are
doubling down, hoping to inflict a humiliating defeat on Mr Putin and to
maybe even trigger his removal. They are increasing aid to Ukraine while
using economic sanctions to inflict massive punishment on Russia, a step
that Putin now sees as "akin to a declaration of war". [America and its
allies may be able to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine, but the
country will be gravely damaged, if not dismembered.]{.underline}
[Moreover, [there is a serious **threat of escalation** beyond Ukraine,
not to mention the danger of nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the
West not only thwarts Moscow on Ukraine's battlefields, but also does
serious, [[lasting damage to Russia's economy,]{.mark} it is in effect
[pushing a great power to the brink]{.mark}. Mr [Putin]{.mark} might
then [turn to nuclear weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} At this point it is
impossible to know the terms on which this conflict will be settled.
But, if we do not understand its deep cause, we will be unable to end it
before Ukraine is wrecked and NATO ends up in a war with Russia.

Both [Sweden and Finland have applied for membership]{.underline} within
the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline} this week, with
both [countries ending their **long-standing** policy of
neutrality.]{.underline} On Wednesday, several NATO members announced
they would immediately [extend NATO-like military defense]{.underline}
to both Finland and Sweden. In a joint statement, Denmark, Iceland, and
Norway announced: "Should Finland or Sweden be victim of aggression on
their territory before obtaining NATO membership, we will assist Finland
and Sweden by all means necessary." The Biden administration made an
identical pledge, noting in a White House statement that while Sweden's
and Finland's: "... applications for NATO membership are being
considered, the United States will work with Finland and Sweden to
remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter
and confront aggression or the threat of aggression." Although neither
statement mentions Russia, it is clear that [both [statements]{.mark}
were [aimed at Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of communicating
that---regardless of what the formal membership process may be---both
Finland and Sweden will immediately become de facto members of NATO. Joe
Biden's move expands the number of counties for which Americans could be
expected to die and the number of countries that American taxpayers will
be expected to subsidize with their tax dollars. Also within the Biden
statement was the often-repeated---and false---claim that the expansion
of NATO benefits Americans overall: "NATO guarantees the security of one
billion people in Europe and North America.... By joining NATO, \[Sweden
and Finland\] will further strengthen our defense cooperation and
benefit the entire Transatlantic Alliance." But there are numerous
problems with this claim. NATO membership has nothing to do with
enhancing the defense of ordinary Americans. The American elites love
NATO, of course, because it expands regime spending and influence in
Europe. But when it comes down to actual military defense[, [expanding
NATO]{.mark} only [increases]{.mark} the [odds]{.mark} that
[Americans]{.mark} will be [pulled into]{.mark} a **[major

return]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Moreover, the [[Russian]{.mark}
regime's [inability]{.mark} to **overrun Ukraine** has]{.underline}
[[demonstrated]{.mark} that [Moscow presents **no
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Europe that the Europeans cannot quite
thoroughly counter themselves. But there's [one way to make the
addition]{.underline} of Sweden and Finland to NATO [a good
[deal:]{.mark} NATO can add whatever countries it wants so long as the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [leaves as]{.mark} part of the
[bargain]{.mark}]{.underline}. Two More Countries for Americans to
Subsidize Back in March, we examined the extent to which the [US
taxpayer overwhelmingly covers the costs of NATO]{.underline}. For
example, the total military spending of all NATO members combined is
more than \$1 trillion. So how much of this total is provided by US
taxpayers? In the first graph, we see that the [US's share of this is
70.5 percent]{.underline}, and that the top ten contributors constitute
95.0 percent of all military spending. That is, the US contributes 70
percent of all NATO defense dollars while the next nine states
contribute an additional 25 percent. The other twenty NATO member states
contribute a meagre and forgettable 5 percent of all spending.
[**\<\<CHART OMITTED\>\>**With the addition of Finland and Sweden, those
countries that contribute negligible amounts to NATO's defense
spending]{.underline} will increase to twenty-two. But the [situation
will remain essentially the same]{.underline}. According to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Sweden's total
military spending in 2020 was \$6.2 billion, which places it between
Romania and Norway. Finland's total spending of \$3.9 billion places it
between Portugal and Denmark. These tiny numbers aren't surprising.
Finland has a gross domestic product about the size of Missouri's, while
Sweden's GDP is about the size of Massachusetts's. **[\<\<CHART
OMITTED\>\>]{.underline}**It's possible that adding Finland and Sweden
into the mix could drop the US share of total NATO defense spending to
70.0 percent or 69.0 percent. [In any case, [Europeans]{.mark} can
continue to [milk the US]{.mark} taxpayer dry [for security]{.mark}
guarantees.]{.underline} After all, as non-NATO members, Sweden and
Finland spend approximately 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP on
military spending, respectively. (It's 3.7 percent for the US.) As NATO
members, there is [no real incentive for Finland and Sweden to spend any
more]{.underline}. [Given that NATO **[doesn't]{.mark} really [enforce
]{.mark}**[its]{.mark} "rule" that all members must spend [2.0 percent
of GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}, we can expect more business as usual should
Sweden and Finland join the alliance. What do Sweden and Finland
contribute to US security? Biden claims both countries will "benefit the
entire Transatlantic Alliance." Of course, they will do no such thing.
Finland, especially, is a net liability due to its long land border with
Russia and its maritime border in the vicinity of St. Petersburg. Here's
the problem with that. [NATO [started]{.mark} out [as]{.mark} an
[arguably reasonable]{.mark} alliance of Western European states [with
multiple buffer state]{.mark}s between NATO and the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. The only land border shared between Russia and a
NATO state at that time was in the distant north of Norway. [Yet,
[after]{.mark} years of [expansion]{.mark}, [NATO]{.mark} has expanded
**[right up to Russia]{.mark}** itself [throughout]{.mark} the [Baltic
and around Kaliningrad]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since NATO demands an
"attack" on one member be treated as an attack on all members, this can
[[turn small regional disputes into]{.mark} a **[global
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Now, NATO [wants to add]{.mark} to the
potential for such a situation by adding the [Finland-Russia
border]{.mark}]{.underline} into the mix. Should Finland or the Baltic
states get into a regional conflict with Russia, [how many Americans
will be asked to die to defend the distant reaches of eastern
Europe?]{.underline} [The [Ukraine]{.mark} War [Shows Europe Doesn't
Need the US]{.mark} for Defense]{.underline} If anything illustrates
[[now is a good time]{.mark} for the US to leave]{.underline} the
alliance, it's the [[lackluster]{.mark} performance of the [Russian
military]{.mark}.]{.underline} The US should never have pledged itself
to Europe's defense on legal, moral, and practical grounds. But, there
always remained the consequentialist argument that without the US in
NATO, the Soviets would roll through Paris and Rome and Madrid, imposing
Soviet despotism everywhere. Once the enormous Soviet military
disappeared from the globe, this same argument was then recycled with
"Russia" replacing "Red Army." [The [threat]{.mark} of the Soviets to
Europe **[was always exaggerated]{.mark},**]{.underline} but the [claim
that [Russia]{.mark} presents an [existential threat]{.mark} to Europe
is **[not even plausible]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The situation in
Ukraine has made this abundantly clear. The international Western media,
after all, has itself told us that Russian military [personnel are
[incompetent and woefully inept]{.mark}]{.underline} when it comes to
carrying out the assumed occupation of Ukraine[. Western reports
[routinely]{.mark} assert that [Russia]{.mark}n troops are [retreating,
failing]{.mark}, and sustaining [heavy losses]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [[Ukraine]{.mark} is a country [with a GDP per capita]{.mark}
that's [less than half]{.mark} of Russia's]{.underline}. Ukraine is
thoroughly [[undeveloped industrially]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
[relies]{.mark} heavily [on weapons gifted]{.mark}]{.underline} by
outsiders. If the Russians can't even make short order of Ukraine---a
country right on Russia's border---how will that same military roll
through Prague? Yet, even while the media labels the invasion a complete
debacle, we're also being told by pundits and "experts" that without
defense guarantees from the Americans, Helsinki will soon be Russian
territory. It's extremely doubtful that both claims can be true. In any
case, whatever the Western propaganda narrative currently claims, [the
fact is [Russia has a second-rate economy]{.mark} coupled [with
demographic decline]{.mark} at least]{.underline} as bad as that seen in
the rest of Europe. Russia's GDP---and thus its [[access to military
resources---is a small fraction of]{.mark} that of the [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion. In other words,]{.underline} Russia simply lacks what is
needed to present any real threat to Europe. The lack of quick progress
in Ukraine is only the latest evidence of this. The Europeans are
welcome to keep NATO going if they like. They're more than capable of
doing so. But the time has come for the United States to exit.

### Not Revisionist\-\--AT: Ukraine\-\--2NC

#### Russia interprets expansion as aggression \-- US bombing of Russian ally, Ukraine seen as buffer in Moscow

William **Glucroft, 22** (2/23/22; Freelance reporter; "NATO: Why Russia
has a problem with its eastward expansion"; DW
https://www.dw.com/en/nato-why-russia-has-a-problem-with-its-eastward-expansion/a-60891681
)LVL

The role of NATO--- the trans-Atlantic military alliance founded in 1949
specifically to counter the Soviet Empire in Europe --- has been an
evolving discussion [[since the breakup of]{.mark} the
[USSR]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1991. Back then, many foreign policy
experts were urging triumphant Western leaders to establish a new
security framework to redefine relations with Russia, which inherited
the ruins of the Soviet Union. [The [West]{.mark}]{.underline} \"held
all the cards in 1990-1991,\" Dan Plesch, a professor of diplomacy at
the SOAS University of London, told DW. \"The Soviet Union managed a
\[relatively\] peaceful end to empire, which is almost unprecedented and
for which they got no credit,\" he said. The demise of the USSR led to a
flurry of high-level meetings and negotiations between American and
Soviet --- later Russian --- officials, but \"we [[never made]{.mark} a
serious [effort to bring]{.mark} the [Russians
in]{.mark}]{.underline},\" according to Plesch. Amid intense political
and economic instability in [Russia]{.underline} during the 1990s,
opposing the Western alliance was one of the few issues that united the
country\'s fractious political spectrum, according to declassified
documents maintained by the National Security Archive at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C. \"[We believe that the
eastward expansion of NATO is a mistake and a serious one at
that]{.underline},\" Boris Yeltsin, Russia\'s first post-Soviet
president, told reporters at a 1997 news conference with US President
Bill Clinton in Helsinki, where the two signed a statement on arms
control. Indeed, [documents show a]{.underline} [[pattern of promises US
negotiators made]{.mark} to their Russian counterparts as well as
internal policy discussions [opposing NATO expansion to Eastern
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"In the current environment, it is not in
the best interest of NATO or the US that \[Eastern European\] states be
granted full NATO membership and its security guarantees,\" according to
a State Department memorandum in 1990, while those states were still
emerging from Soviet control as the Warsaw Pact disintegrated. \"\[We\]
do not, in any case, wish to organize an anti-Soviet coalition whose
frontier is the Soviet border. Such a coalition would be perceived very
negatively by the Soviets.\" None of these discussions ever became
official policy, and none of the alleged pledges ever made it into a
legally binding document with Russia. Moreover, they took place in a
specific contemporary historical context: The Berlin Wall had just
fallen in 1989. Especially the Baltic Sea states of Lithuania, Latvia,
and Estonia --- which were part of the Soviet Union from the 1940s to
1991 --- saw an increased drive for political self-determination and a
reorientation of the region\'s security structure. The three states
pointed to the UN Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and
Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, which refers to
\"political independence both internally and externally.\" After the
dissolution of the Soviet Union the Eastern European military alliance,
the Warsaw Pact, disbanded in 1991. US president Bill Clinton pursued
Partnership for Peace, which Russia joined in 1994. However, there was
disagreement over whether that was an alternative to NATO membership or
a pathway to it. In 1997 NATO and Russia signed the \"Founding Act\" on
mutual relations, cooperation, and security, and the NATO-Russia Council
was founded in 2002, both of which were intended to boost cooperation.
Moscow received access and a permanent presence at NATO headquarters in
Brussels. But this exchange has been largely halted since Russia\'s
attack on Ukraine in 2014. All the while, NATO maintained an \"open
door\" policy on membership and stood by all countries\' right to choose
their alliances. [From the Western perspective, keeping NATO to its Cold
War borders was only valid so long as Soviet forces remained in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. In the \"Two plus Four\" negotiations for a
reunited Germany in 1990, the two German states and the four World War
II allies --- the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union --- agreed
that no NATO soldiers may be stationed on the territory of the former
East German communist GDR. To this day, only the German Bundeswehr
operates here. Russia\'s sensitivities over NATO\'s possible eastward
expansion were well known. \"[[No matter how nuanced, if NATO adopts a
policy which envisions expansion into Central and Eastern Europe without
holding]{.mark} the [door open to Russia, it would be]{.mark}
universally [interpreted in Moscow as]{.mark} directed [against
Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}\" US diplomat James Collins wrote in a
State Department cable in 1993. But since 1990, NATO has gone through
five rounds of enlargement to include former parts of the Soviet Union
and several former Warsaw Pact states. In 2010, NATO\'s strategic
concept, which governs alliance policy, says \"NATO poses no threat to
Russia\" and calls for a \"true strategic partnership\" between the two
sides. The document came out two years after Russia\'s military
intervention in Georgia but before its first attack on Ukraine. It is
based on many of the post-Cold War arrangements that Putin now appears
to want to abandon. In 2008 NATO floated the possibility of Georgia
joining and intensified cooperation with Ukraine in 2014. At the same
time, many of the Cold War fail-safes --- such as arms control
verification and lines of communication --- have fallen away. [[NATO
carried out an aerial bombing campaign against Serbia]{.mark} in 1999
during the Kosovo war. Serbia was [a Russian ally]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Vladimir Putin was elected president not long thereafter. He still cites
the [[bombing]{.mark} as [proof of NATO aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- also in the context of the current crisis. The issue has taken a
central role as he has ordered his armed forces towards Ukraine\'s
borders, most recently sending some of them into breakaway regions that
Russia supports. \"[If Ukraine were to join NATO, it would serve as a
direct threat to the security of Russia,[\" Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}
said in televised remarks on Monday, during which he [[described]{.mark}
**[Ukraine as a \"springboard\" for a NATO strike against
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO has dismissed Putin\'s sense of
encirclement, given Russia\'s massive size that extends to the Pacific
Ocean. However, the vast majority of the Russian population lives on the
country\'s European side. JD Bindenagel, a former deputy US ambassador
to Germany, told DW that he believes NATO\'s mistake was not so much the
actual enlargement, but with not taking seriously the Russian view that
it had been betrayed. \"We never engaged with it; we thought this was a
ridiculous narrative. And so we would say, \'no that didn\'t happen,\'\"
he said.

#### Russian policy aims to keep the squo \-- even if they're revanchist they're not revisionist

Zachary **Paikin, 20** (11/10/20; Researcher in the EU Foreign Policy

Nonetheless, although the 2013-14 [[Ukraine crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}
represents a breaking point in Russia-West relations that has
inaugurated a period characterized most often by zero-sum hostility,
this [[does not imply]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Russian foreign policy
has suddenly adopted a]{.mark} distinctly [revisionist
character.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moscow's behavior may have grown more
assertive in recent years, but Russia's overall aim of restoring its
national power and obtaining recognition of its rights as a great power
has not changed. [[Revanchism does not]{.mark} necessarily [equate to
revisionism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Spoiler (or even revisionist)
[[tactics employed to achieve status quo aims are not the same as a
revisionist strategy.]{.mark}]{.underline} While Moscow may be unhappy
with a post-Cold War outcome that has "sidelined its security
interests," the "Western-centric system of liberal democracies" never
succeeded in entrenching itself as a fully legitimate and universally
accepted global order. Moscow's attentiveness to European normative
pronouncements may have waned as its declared "pivot to the east" has
accelerated in the years since the Ukraine crisis. However, Russia still
maintains that the EEU is designed to complement the EU through a
potential future integration of equals. [[Nor is Moscow's deepening
strategic partnership with Beijing necessarily a sign of a
revisionist]{.mark} global [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While Russia
and China have been pushed closer together by their respective
deteriorating relations with the United States, the process of
normalization of ties between them dates to the late Cold War
period.]{.underline} [[It is]{.mark} in [Moscow's interest to pursue
good relations with a country]{.mark} with which [it shares a]{.mark}
lengthy [border,]{.mark}]{.underline} just as it is natural for Russia
to seek to avoid isolation in the strategic triangle composed of itself,
China, and the United States. The assumption until now has been, at the
very least, that the rules-based international order---marked by a
universal commitment to multilateralism and the proliferation of robust
international institutions---is synonymous with the contemporary world
order. Yet the [growing consensus that global multilateralism is in
crisis demonstrates that a plethora of divergent ideas about how to
organize the world continue to co-exist. This [should encourage Western
countries]{.mark} [to rethink their policies toward Russia]{.mark} and
revisit some of their ingrained beliefs regarding the nature of the
contemporary order.]{.underline}

New York Times, a position he assumed in 2017, 3/29/2022, "Peace Talks
May be Little More than Russian Tactics, Analysts say,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html>,

BRUSSELS --- As envoys made progress in peace talks on Tuesday, [[Russia
offered **concessions**]{.mark} that signaled a more realistic course
for the war in Ukraine]{.underline}, [[while indicating it is also in
**no hurry** to **end** the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
diplomats and analysts.

[Russia's deputy defense minister]{.underline}, Aleksandr Fomin,
[presented the decision to "sharply reduce" military activity around the
Ukrainian capital, Kyiv]{.underline}, and the northern city of Chernihiv
as a gesture "to increase mutual trust for future negotiations."

"De-escalation is a euphemism for retreat," said Lawrence Freedman,
emeritus professor of War Studies at King's College London. "[[Russia is
adjusting its goals to reality, because war is]{.mark} quite
[empirical]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "It's not a ruse to say that
they are concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that's all they
can do."

[Some [analysts say]{.mark} such [an agreement
would]{.mark}]{.underline}, at minimum, h[ave to [give Russia control of
**Mariupol**]{.mark}, the besieged port city in Ukraine that is still
somehow holding out, to [create a]{.mark} secure [land route
between]{.mark} two areas that Russia occupies: **[Crimea]{.mark}** to
the west, [and]{.mark} the **[Donbas]{.mark}** to the east.]{.underline}
And it would also, they say, have to cede control over the two
administrative regions in the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, which Mr.
Putin has already declared to be independent republics.

Nor will Mr. Putin easily end the war, Mr. Heisbourg said. If he takes
the area east of the Dnieper, "that may be enough for now, but [[he will
rebuild his army and continue."]{.underline}]{.mark}

For both sides, said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the
London research institution, "[[the negotiations are **not
serious**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the sense that [[negotiations]{.mark}
now for both sides [are a **continuation** of the war, **not** a
**solution**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Russia can concentrate on the east,
and Ukraine will find it hard to move from its agile defense to serious
counterattacks, he said. "And Putin hasn't forgotten about Kyiv."

Even [if Mr. Putin can control and "settle" for another
partition]{.underline} of Ukraine in the east, "Ukraine has to sign up
for it, and if not, I don't think we lift the sanctions," Mr. Niblett
said.

His colleague, Mathieu Boulègue, a French scholar who studies the
Russian military, agrees that [[**Russia** is **not** negotiating in
**good faith**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but "**testing** the **waters**
and applying for time, to **regroup**]{.mark} and **re-equip**
[militarily]{.mark} and make more gains on the ground."]{.underline}

The Russian military appears to have taken control of what might be
called Phase 2 of a botched operation, he said, which should have been
Phase 1. Taking Mariupol, the land bridge and the Donbas "would have
been the grown-up military plan." [Modern warfare is half information
warfare, Mr. Boulègue said, "and success is what you make of it,"
especially in a repressive media environment as in Russia
now.]{.underline}

The Russian forces' inability to capture cities and keep territory is
apparent after a month, he said, "so [strategic goals have had to
change."]{.underline}

But to completely withdraw from Kyiv would allow the Ukrainians to
reinforce the Donbas region and give them a significant victory,
suggested Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at CNA, a defense
research institution in Virginia, [in a
tweet.](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1508795729728487427)

Traveling in Morocco, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken also
cast doubt on Russia's pledge to reduce hostilities. "[[There is what
Russia **says** and there's what Russia **does**]{.mark},"]{.underline}
he said on Tuesday. "We're focused on the latter. And what Russia is
doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that
continues as we speak."

[[Russia did **not** stop fighting after]{.mark} the **annexation** of
**[Crimea]{.mark}** in 2014]{.underline}, but actively supported the
separatists in the Donbas, said Ian Bond, a former British diplomat in
Russia and the head of foreign policy for the Center for European
Reform. "[I'm a **skeptic** about the Russians giving up on the
**war**]{.underline}," he said. "We've seen this movie before in 2014
and 2015. I view this as only a pause."

Ian Garner, a historian of Russian propaganda, [pointed out on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/irgarner/status/1508823205011730442) that
"[Putin's Russia --- indeed, post-Soviet Russia]{.underline} --- has
been engaged in mucky, endless conflicts for years," citing Transnistria
in Moldova, Abkhazia in Georgia and the Donbas, all areas in other
countries where Russian forces back separatist movements. "[Not ended,
maybe," he said, but "in the **intermission**."]{.underline}

Ukrainian and Western officials also suggested that Russia would be
willing for a demilitarized Ukraine to join the European Union, so long
as it [forswore joining NATO or hosting any foreign forces.]{.underline}

But [security [**analysts questioned** the **sincerity** of]{.mark} such
[an agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Mr. Bond said that [the problem with Ukraine's notion of neutrality
is]{.underline} that so far [**none** of the countries it wants to
guarantee it would agree to do so]{.underline}. It would be like NATO
membership with collective defense by another name, so highly unlikely,
he said.

As for [European Union membership]{.underline}, Mr. Niblett said, that
would represent [the largest danger to Mr. Putin]{.underline}, who
helped stimulate the 2014 revolt in Ukraine when he forced the
then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, to renege on a trade agreement with
the bloc. [If Ukraine joined now]{.underline}, Mr. Niblett said, [the
country would develop economically even faster]{.underline}, in contrast
to Russia, "and [you would end up with a South Korea next to a North
Korea, and I can't see Putin accepting that."]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--AT: Relations\-\--2AC

It is hard to imagine that [U.S.-Russian relations]{.underline} could
get much worse, but sadly, they are [unlikely to get better anytime
soon]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} has [defined his country's
[interests]{.mark} in ways that are **[incompatible with the]{.mark}
interests** of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its European
allies.]{.underline} The latter believe that [[democracy]{.mark}, the
[rule of law]{.mark}, and the provision of [security to]{.mark} eastern
[Europea]{.mark}n countries enhance stability;
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, meanwhile, [[considers]{.mark} the spread
of **[democracy]{.mark} to be [a threat to his
regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and believes that having vulnerable
neighbors enhances Russian security]{.underline}.

[**Any sustained improvement** of relations]{.underline} between the
United States and Russia beyond progress on arms control (such as the
recent extension of the New START treaty) [would require]{.underline}
one of two concessions: either [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[shelves its foundational support for
democracy]{.underline}** [and formally]{.underline} **[recognizes a
Russian-privileged sphere of influence]{.underline}** in the former
Soviet Union [or the Russian president decides his interests are not
threatened by greater democracy]{.underline} in the region
[or]{.underline} by having [fully sovereign neighbors]{.underline}.
**[Neither is likely to materialize]{.underline}** in the near future.
The election of U.S. President Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, who has
[[made]{.mark} support for [democracy]{.mark} at home and abroad [the
**centerpiece of his presidency**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[signals]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[will not cease]{.underline}** [to champion traditional democratic
values in Europe]{.underline} for at least the next four years.
Meanwhile, [as long as Putin remains in power]{.underline},
[Moscow]{.underline}'s policy [will]{.underline} continue to [be marked
by a fear of democracy and]{.underline} of the [full sovereignty of
Russia's neighbors.]{.underline}

THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

[U.S. decision-makers]{.underline} approached the post--Cold War world
with a clear lesson from the American experience in the twentieth
century. Like many others, [they drew a link between U.S. disengagement
from Europe after W]{.underline}orld [W]{.underline}ar [I]{.underline}
[and the onset of W]{.underline}orld [W]{.underline}ar [II]{.underline}
just two decades later. They also saw the United States' decision to
remain in Europe in the face of potential Soviet aggression after the
end of World War II as having saved Western Europe from a communist
fate. For U.S. officials, then, continued American dominance over
European security through NATO was necessary to keep the peace in the
uncertain times following the Cold War. The outbreak of war in
Yugoslavia exacerbated those fears, feeding the narrative that without
the United States, nationalism was waiting to be unleashed and conflict
could erupt anywhere in the region.

But the United States also sought to reassure first the Soviets and then
the Russians that the West would not take advantage of the end of
Moscow's domination of eastern Europe to undermine the former
superpower's security. When U.S. President Bill [Clinton
informed]{.underline} Russian President [Boris Yeltsin]{.underline} in
September 1994 [of plans to move forward with NATO
enlargement]{.underline}, [he said]{.underline}, "[I don't want you to
believe that I wake up every morning thinking only about how to make the
Warsaw Pact countries a part of NATO]{.underline}---**[that's not the
way I look at it.]{.underline}** What I do think about is how to use
NATO expansion to advance the broader, higher goal of European security,
unity and integration---a goal I know you share."

That quote succinctly summarizes the differences between the United
States and Russia during the Yeltsin presidency. For the United States,
NATO was the right instrument to achieve European stability and security
because it enabled the United States to remain in charge. The U.S.
president argued as much and sought to prove that he was not trying to
harm Russia by exploiting the Warsaw Pact's collapse. But American
leadership was precisely what made NATO the wrong instrument from
Russia's perspective. Yeltsin, although he might have agreed with
Clinton's objective of fostering European unity, did not share his
American counterpart's belief that NATO was the best means to achieve
it---nor did any other top Russian official. Under the U.S. leadership
of NATO, junior partnership would have been the best available option
for Russia. But given Russian opposition to such an arrangement, it was
ultimately left out of the Europe that the United States sought to build
through the alliance.

Yeltsin had staked his political fortunes on bringing his country into
the West. Since his domestic political battle with Mikhail Gorbachev in
the waning months of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin had sought to win favor
by being more pro-Western, pro-democracy, and pro-market than the Soviet
leader. He was too weak to oppose American policies, so he took what he
could get---not just financial assistance from the United States, its
allies, and international financial institutions but also symbols that
he was being treated like an equal. These included the NATO-Russia
Founding Act---which established a partnership between the West and
Russia as invitations to join the alliance were extended to the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland---and Russian participation in the G-7
group of advanced industrialized democracies, creating the G-8.

By the end of the 1990s, it seemed that for all the challenges in
relations between the United States and Russia (most notably over NATO's
78-day bombing campaign of Serbia on behalf of the Kosovars), the United
States and Europe had managed to overcome Cold War divisions and stave
off the worst of nationalism in Europe. Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic
was no longer able to unleash terror in the western Balkans; the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO and others were soon to
follow; the European Union was moving forward with its own expansion
across Europe; and Russia still seemed oriented toward the West. In
November 1999, Clinton visited his alma mater, Georgetown University, to
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It
was, in a sense, the valedictory of his effort to build on President
George H. W. Bush's vision of a Europe "whole and free." Clinton
reminded his audience that he had set out to "do for the Eastern half of
Europe what we helped to do for the Western half after World War II." As
for Russia, he argued, its "transformation has just begun. It is
incomplete. It is awkward. Sometimes it is not pretty, but we have a
profound stake in its success."

Clinton also declared, "Now we are at the height of our power and
prosperity." He meant it as a confirmation that the United States was
capable of shaping global affairs to its liking. After all, he had made
the notion of the United States as the "indispensable nation" a hallmark
of his presidency. Unfortunately, the belief that the United States was
at the height of its power and prosperity turned out to be a prophecy,
as others, including Russia, gained more power, and the United States'
ability to dominate those countries declined dramatically.

RUSSIA'S RETURN

Reflecting on the 1990s, Putin saw humiliation for Russia. He believed
that the West was working to impose its vision of world order. The
collapse of the Soviet Union was "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe
of the century," Putin declared. "As for the Russian people, it became a
genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen
found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory."

Putin was not suggesting that he wanted to re-create the USSR. But
rather than seek to integrate Russia into the West as his anti-Soviet
predecessor had done---which inevitably meant relegating Russia to the
role of junior partner to the United States---Putin sought to build an
independent great power, one that could engage with the West on its own
terms and dominate its immediate neighborhood. Early in Putin's
presidency, his policies were not necessarily antagonistic but sought to
free Russia from Western, and especially American, interference.

From an American perspective, NATO enlargement, the 1999 Kosovo war, the
2002 unilateral American withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABM Treaty), the 2003 Iraq war, and support for the 2003--5
"color revolutions" in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine were discrete
policies. [U.S. officials saw themselves not as harming Russian
interests but rather as]{.underline} **[fostering democracy and the rule
of law]{.underline}** [across]{.underline} central and eastern
[Europe]{.underline}, protecting the Kosovars from Milosevic's brutal
regime, [creating the ability to defend the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline} from Iran's ballistic
missile threat, eliminating the possibility that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein could threaten the world with weapons of mass destruction, and
[supporting reformers [**trying to build democracy** in fragile
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Reflecting on the 1990s, Putin saw humiliation for Russia.

The Russian perspective starkly differed. Officials in Moscow watched
the United States not only keep its Cold War alliance but expand it,
incorporating territory formerly controlled by the Soviet Union,
including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. When NATO went to war against
Serbia in 1999, it did so over Russian objections and without going
through the UN Security Council---where Russia's status as a permanent
member would have allowed it to veto the action. A mere four years
later, NATO went to war against Iraq, again without Security Council
authorization and again brushing aside Russian (as well as French and
German) opposition. [Many in Moscow viewed the United States' departure
from the ABM Treaty as degrading Russia's nuclear deterrent]{.underline}
(particularly [after the]{.underline} George W. [Bush administration
announced its plans to build a missile defense system with interceptors
and a radar]{.underline} to be stationed in Poland and the Czech
Republic, respectively). And for Putin, [[the "color revolutions"
were]{.mark} not evidence of civil society flourishing but rather
confirmation that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [was [pursuing regime change in
Europe,]{.mark} [including]{.mark} in Russia.]{.underline} [For
Moscow]{.underline}, then, [the same events that, from the American
perspective]{.underline}, [were discrete policies having little to do
with Russia built a narrative of a U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[[seeking to impose]{.underline}]{.mark}** [its
will and [principles on others]{.mark} to the detriment of Russian
interests.]{.underline}

In 2007, [[Putin]{.mark} went to the annual]{.underline} Munich Security
[Conference and gave a speech [**venting his opposition** to]{.mark}
U.S. actions]{.underline} on these grounds. [He complained about
[American unilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}: "**[One single center of
power.]{.underline}** [One single center of force. One single center of
decision-makin]{.underline}g. **[This is [the world of one
master]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [one sovereign]{.underline}." He argued
that "the process of [NATO expansion has nothing to do with
modernization of the alliance]{.underline}," declaring, "[We have the
right to ask, 'Against whom is this expansion directed?'"]{.underline}

And always, [there was Ukraine, which Putin told]{.underline} President
George W. [Bush]{.underline} in 2008 [was **"not even a
country."**]{.underline} Yeltsin a decade earlier had warned Clinton
that he could not accept Ukraine's membership in NATO and sought a
private agreement that the United States would not pursue it. By
February 2008, U.S. Ambassador to Russia William Burns was telling his
superiors in Washington, "Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of
all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin)." He warned that
Russian officials would view offering a Membership Action Plan (MAP)---a
step toward NATO membership---to Ukraine (and Georgia) at the upcoming
NATO summit as "throwing down the strategic gauntlet."

French and German opposition to offering Ukraine and Georgia MAPs took
the idea off the table, but the compromise forged within the alliance
led to a NATO summit declaration that Ukraine and Georgia "will become
members of NATO." By going to war with Georgia in 2008 and invading
Ukraine in 2014, Putin confirmed what Burns had warned against: Putin
would not tolerate the crossing of certain redlines perceived as too
threatening to Russia's interests.

Putin sought to build an independent great power, one that could engage
with the West on its own terms.

[The conflicts over [Ukraine and Georgia reflect]{.mark}ed
the]{.underline} United States' and Russia's **[[divergent]{.mark}
definitions of their [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** during the George
W. Bush and Putin years. As Clinton argued to Yeltsin in 1994, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [believed expanding Western
institutions would offer much-needed stability]{.underline} and security
to eastern European countries. Meanwhile, [Russia was
protecting]{.underline} what it viewed as [its privileged sphere of
influence]{.underline} from Western norms, rules, and institutions. [The
West believed sovereign countries could **make their own
choices**]{.underline} about their future, [which]{.underline}, in turn,
[was viewed in Moscow as **undermining Russian interests**]{.underline}
and, potentially, even its regime.

[There appeared to be a **brief respite from these conflicts** with the
"**reset,"**]{.underline} a policy undertaken by President Barack Obama
with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (who was keeping the presidential
seat warm while Vladimir Putin held the post of prime minister). The
reset was a transactional approach to policy, with each side recognizing
the other's core interests. Obama made clear he would not promote
Ukrainian and Georgian membership in NATO and abandoned the missile
defense plan launched by the Bush administration in favor of a different
missile defense deployment more clearly designed to combat Iran.
Meanwhile, Russia agreed to support stiffer sanctions on Iran to induce
Tehran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Most important, Moscow
allowed the United States to create a new corridor to resupply
Afghanistan through Russian-controlled airspace, which meant that the
United States was no longer completely reliant on Pakistan. The two
countries also agreed that it was in their mutual interest to forge a
new arms control agreement, the New START treaty, which would further
reduce their number of strategic nuclear weapons and provide
verification measures to uphold it.

[Alas, the **reset ended**]{.underline}. Although [the Russians
abstained during the]{.underline} Security Council's [vote authorizing
NATO to launch airstrikes against Libya]{.underline} in 2011 to protect
the population of Benghazi, [Putin fumed when the operation precipitated
the]{.underline} overthrow and [death of President]{.underline} Muammar
[al-Qaddafi.]{.underline} Later that year, **[protests erupted in
Russia]{.underline}** around the parliamentary elections, [and Putin
interpreted]{.underline} then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
[Clinton's statements as **egging on his opponents**]{.underline}. In
2013, Edward Snowden's leaks of National Security Agency documents,
followed by his receiving asylum in Russia, grabbed headlines. [[The
**relationship truly came undone** when Putin annexed Crimea and
started]{.mark} a civil war in]{.underline} eastern
[[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} the following year. [[Large countries
invading]{.mark} their [smaller neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly in Europe, [had been part of a bygone]{.underline} era and
shocked Europeans who had come to believe that the creation and
expansion of the European Union had definitively made war on the
continent a thing of the past. In response, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and its
allies [slapped sanctions]{.mark} on Russia. It seemed [the relationship
**could not get**]{.mark} **much [worse.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

DOOMED TO FAIL

[[Any attempt]{.mark} by]{.underline} Donald [Trump [to improve the
relationship was **doomed from the start**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having
been compromised by Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential
election, Trump could not afford to be seen as doing Putin's bidding,
especially in a number of key areas. [Congress]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[was not only unwilling to lift sanctions on Russia but added to them
after the Russian interference was exposed]{.underline}. [[U.S.]{.mark}
officials]{.underline} throughout the government---political appointees
and career officials alike---[remained committed to]{.underline}
continuing the United States' policy of providing reassurance to NATO's
eastern neighbors and [[reinforcing deterrence]{.mark} in the aftermath
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including]{.underline} stepped-up
air and sea [patrols in the Baltic]{.underline} Sea [and Black
Sea]{.underline} regions [as well as enhanced military exercises and
rotations of]{.underline} military [deployments]{.underline}. [[Beyond
**exacerbating existing political polarization**]{.mark} in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [[Putin achieved]{.mark} very
[little]{.mark} by interfering in U.S. domestic politics]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the]{.underline} Trump administration's National Defense
[Strategy]{.underline} and National Security Strategy [made clear that
[Russia was]{.mark} now, along with China, [a **"strategic
competitor."**]{.mark}]{.underline} And with the urging of his then
National Security Adviser John Bolton, [[Trump pulled out of the]{.mark}
three-decade-old I]{.underline}ntermediate-[R]{.underline}ange
[[Nuclear]{.mark} F]{.underline}orces [[Treaty over]{.mark} the
**long-standing complaint of [Russian violations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Although his predecessor had refused to commit to extending the New
START treaty, Biden agreed with the Russians on a five-year extension
shortly after he entered office. Addressing the dangers of nuclear
weapons is the one area in which the interests of the two sides allow
for greater cooperation. Arms control emerged as a staple of the
relationship in the aftermath of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, focusing
first on limiting nuclear testing and later on capping the numbers of
missiles and warheads. It is the one issue that creates the optic of two
superpowers, thereby giving Russia its cherished status as an equal to
the United States. And it is in the interests of both sides to limit
nuclear weapons and provide verification measures to prevent breaches.

A BLEAK FUTURE

In 1993, [Clinton decided to back Yeltsin as the best hope for a
U.S.-Russian partnership]{.underline}. Eight years later, George W.
[Bush looked Putin in the eye and came away believing he had peered into
the Russian president's soul. [Obama]{.mark}]{.underline} took office in
2009 [**[seeking a reset]{.mark}** of U.S.-Russian
relations]{.underline} with his first-term counterpart, Medvedev. Eight
years later, Trump began his presidency under the cloud of Russian
interference in the U.S. election but seeming to believe whatever Putin
told him.

In each case, [**[early high hopes]{.mark}** for the U.S.-Russian
relationship soon **[gave way to bitter
realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The 1999 NATO bombing campaign
against Serbia created the worst conflict between the two
powers]{.underline} during the Clinton-Yeltsin years. In 2008, [the
Russian-Georgian war left in tatters a relationship that had
foundered]{.underline} since the 2003 U.S. decision to go to war in
Iraq. Early in Obama's second term, [Putin ordered the
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, [leading
the West to impose sanctions and bolster its military
presence]{.underline} in eastern Europe. [And **[regardless of
Trump's]{.mark} strange [affinity]{.mark}** [for Putin]{.mark},
U.S.-Russian [relations]{.mark} **continued to [deteriorate]{.mark}**
during his term]{.underline}.

[[As Biden begins]{.mark} his presidency, **one aspect of U.S.-Russian
[relations is over]{.mark}:** the high hopes for what an incoming U.S.
president can achieve. [The SolarWinds hack, Russian election
interference]{.mark}, the conflict in [Ukraine, and]{.mark} the
[poisoning]{.mark} and arrest of [the Russian]{.mark} opposition
[leader]{.mark}]{.underline} Alexei [Navalny are just some of the issues
that [will **hinder**]{.mark} **any return** to [a]{.mark} more positive
U.S.-Russian [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But ever since
Putin first became president more than 20 years ago, [the bigger issue
has been the [clashing ambitions that]{.mark} U.S. and Russian [leaders
have for the world]{.mark}]{.underline} and especially for Europe.
Although it is possible that Trump would have bowed to Putin's vision in
a second term, [Moscow's and Washington's conflicting visions will be on
full display in the Biden years.]{.underline}

[Better [relations]{.mark} with another country [are]{.mark} never an
end in themselves but rather a means [to **promote national
interests**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
moment, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia **define theirs very
differently**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Beyond exploring new arms
control agreements to limit strategic nuclear weapons, [the bilateral
agenda for U.S.-Russian relations is likely to **remain pretty thin**
for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--AT: Arms Control\-\--2AC

#### The US has [no chance]{.underline} at successful arms control negotiations with Russia\-\--they [want]{.underline} to hold onto their nukes post-Ukraine.

Steven **Pifer 22**, former US ambassador to Ukraine and non-resident
senior fellow at the Arms Control and Non-proliferation Initiative,
5/23/2022, "The Russia-Ukraine War: A Setback for Arms Control,"
<https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/russia-ukraine-war-setback-arms-control>,
RH

The Russia-Ukraine war is entering its fourth month, with no end in
sight. [[The Kremlin seems intent on]{.mark} achieving a [victory on the
**battlefield**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[relations]{.mark} [between
the West and Russia **plummet** to **new lows**]{.mark}. [One
**casualty**]{.mark}: U.S.-Russian **[arms control
negotiations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Then, on February 24, 2022, the Russia launched its brutal and
unjustified invasion of Ukraine. [**[Washington]{.mark}** wound down
"business as usual" and [suspended]{.mark} the [strategic]{.mark}
stability **[dialogue]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Resumption of those discussions almost certainly will have to wait until
an end to the war, and likely for some time after that. [Arms control
[**skeptics** will]{.mark} seize on Russia's attack to [**intensify**
their opposition to any attempt to **negotiate**]{.mark} with
Moscow.]{.underline}

If U.S.-Russian discussions resume at some point, [[the **delay** will
have an **impact**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Persuading Moscow to negotiate
limits on non-strategic nuclear weapons, which would bring in a host of
complex questions]{.underline}, would have been difficult in any case.
Now, however, the sides would have little time to conclude a treaty, let
alone for the Senate to discuss ratification, before the U.S. political
season cranks up in 2024.

Setting aside the time factor, [[the]{.mark} Russia-[Ukraine war]{.mark}
almost certainly [will make it **harder** to **persuade**]{.mark}
Russian [**negotiators** to put]{.mark} non-strategic [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [on the table.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The Russian
military attaches]{.mark} **great [importance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} such
[weapons]{.mark}, [seeing them as]{.mark} one [means to make up
for]{.mark} U.S. and [NATO]{.mark} **[conventional]{.mark} force**
[advantages]{.mark}]{.underline} (to say nothing about China).

Given the abysmal performance by its military against a smaller and
out-gunned foe, [[the Russian General Staff is likely to regard
its]{.mark} non-strategic **[nuclear]{.mark} [arsenal]{.mark}** [as
**more necessary**]{.mark} than ever.]{.underline}

Of particular note, [[the]{.mark} Russian [military]{.mark} [has
devoted]{.mark} significant [efforts in recent years to **adding** to
its **arsenal**]{.mark} precision-guided **conventional weapons,**
including long-range strike systems such as the Kalibr cruise
missile]{.underline}. They demonstrated some of those weapons in Syria.

[[This will make it **harder** to get]{.mark} non-strategic nuclear
weapons in the [negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}. At a minimum, the
price that Russian negotiators will demand, such as limits on missile
defense, will increase.

[The **[Biden]{.mark}** administration thus [has **no chance**]{.mark}
[to get an]{.mark} ambitious **[agreement]{.mark}** in its first
term.]{.underline} As for a second term, who knows what the American
electorate will decide in November 2024?

[**[Arms control]{.mark}** offers a useful **national security** tool
that [can put guardrails on]{.mark} the adversarial aspects of the
**U.S.-[Russia]{.mark}n relationship**]{.underline}. As Washington and
Moscow find themselves at the most contentious point in their relations
since the early 1980s and perhaps since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
keeping such guardrails in place is more important than ever.
Unfortunately, [[the]{.mark} **Russia-Ukraine [war]{.mark}** [will make
doing that **more difficult** than ever]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration's antipathy toward arms control will strike
again on November 22, when the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[withdraws from]{.mark} the [Open Skies]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline}.
That is a mistake[. While Russia has violated the treaty, the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has reciprocated]{.mark}**. [NATO
allies support the treaty]{.mark} --- which focuses first and foremost
on [enhanc]{.mark}ing [European security]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
wish the United States to remain a party.

Whether the treaty can continue following the American departure remains
to be seen and will depend on what Russia does. When it takes office,
the Biden administration should consider reentering the agreement,
though that may require some creative international lawyering.

THE TREATY

The [[Open Skies]{.underline}]{.mark} Treaty, which entered into force
in 2002, [[permits countries to fly unarmed aircraft with
cameras]{.mark} and other sensors over the territory of the treaty's
other 34 members states.]{.underline} Based on an idea advanced by
Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, [Open Skies provides for the collection
of imagery of [military]{.mark} installations and activities in order to
**foster [transparency]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Each party to the treaty has two annual quotas: the number of flights
it may conduct over other treaty-parties (active quota), and the number
of overflights that it must accept (passive quota).]{.underline}
Aircraft are inspected before conducting an Open Skies flight, and
personnel from the country to be overflown are on board during the
flight.

The treaty offers several advantages. While the capabilities of U.S.
reconnaissance satellites are superior to those of Open Skies aircraft,
all 34 treaty-parties have access to imagery from the flights (whereas
satellite imagery is highly classified). [The treaty gives U.S. allies
and partners, who lack sophisticated imagery satellites, the opportunity
to gather confidence-building data.]{.underline} Moreover, [aircraft
offer **greater flexibility than satellites** in flight plans and can
fly under cloud cover. Open Skies flights can also be **used to send
political signals:** After Russia instigated the conflict in Donbas in
2014, for instance, the United States targeted flights at eastern
Ukraine and the bordering Russian territory in order to send a message
of U.S. support for Kyiv.]{.underline}

By 2019, the 34 parties had conducted a total of **[more than 1,500
overflights]{.underline}**. During the treaty's first 15 years of
operation, the United States conducted [196 flights over Russia and
Belarus (the two are paired for treaty purposes),]{.underline} [while
Russia conducted 71 flights over the United States.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [[Russia has violated]{.mark} the treaty [by imposing
restrictions]{.mark} on certain flights over its territory. In response,
the United States imposed reciprocal restrictions on Russian flights
over U.S. territory.]{.underline} While the Russian violations are
problematic, [[Washington has not declared]{.mark} that they constitute
a [material breach]{.mark} --- that is, a violation that vitiates the
central purpose of the treaty]{.underline}. Nevertheless, on May 21,
Secretary of State Pompeo released a statement saying that, unless
Moscow returned to full compliance, Washington would leave the treaty in
six months' time. The U.S. government provided formal notification of
its intention to withdraw to the other treaty parties the following day;
hence, the U.S. withdrawal will take effect on November 22.

A SERIAL KILLER OF ARMS CONTROL?

By all appearances, the Trump administration sees little value in arms
control and nonproliferation arrangements. In 2018, President Trump
decided to withdraw from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
that limited Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran can produce the fissile
material for a nuclear bomb in a much shorter time today than three
years ago. Meanwhile, the United States stands isolated, with close
allies such as Britain, France, and Germany staying in the agreement and
ignoring Washington's requests to apply sanctions on Tehran.

In 2019, [the Trump administration [withdrew from]{.mark} the 1987
[Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces]{.mark} Treaty, an agreement signed
by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev that banned an entire class of
missiles]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark} had
[violated]{.mark}]{.underline} the agreement by [[deploying **a**
prohibited missile]{.underline}]{.mark}, but President [[Trump]{.mark}'s
team showed **[no interest in preserving the
treaty]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [eschewing military and political
measures that [could have pressured Moscow]{.mark} to return to
compliance.]{.underline}

In 2020, administration officials reportedly considered conducting an
underground nuclear test. That would violate a long-standing test
moratorium observed by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and
France (the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would prohibit all
nuclear tests, has not entered into force). A U.S. nuclear test would
open the door to tests by others, eroding the nuclear knowledge
advantage the United States enjoys from having conducted more tests than
the rest of the world combined.

Happily, the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)
appears safe. True, the Trump administration could in its final days
give notice of an intention to withdraw, but the intention could only be
carried out three months later. President-elect Biden supports New START
and supports its extension; he would revoke any such notice.

However, Open Skies looks to be the outgoing Trump administration's next
--- and last --- victim.

WHAT NEXT FOR OPEN SKIES?

The Open Skies [[Treaty]{.mark} focused on [strengthen]{.mark}ing
[confidence and security]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}, one reason why
the Trump administration [[should have given]{.mark} the [views
of]{.mark} its [allies greater weight]{.mark}]{.underline}. A major
question now turns on what Moscow will do[, given that the U.S.
departure will mean that Russia can conduct flights over European
territory and Canada but not the United States]{.underline}.

[If Moscow decides to withdraw from Open Skies, perhaps citing the
[treaty's decreased value]{.mark} because it can no longer overfly
American territory, the treaty will collapse]{.underline}. [NATO allies
will see little point in overflying other allies or partners such as
Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. Alternatively, Moscow could decide to
remain in the treaty, at least for a time, in part to score propaganda
points over the U.S. withdrawal.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Terror\-\--2AC

#### **US-Russia cooperation can't solve terrorism in the Middle East -- differing tactics and barriers make them incompatible**

//smarx, AZG)

Foolish as it would be to argue that U.S. and Russian interests never
align, [[the U]{.mark}nited States in its broader battle with terrorism
**[cannot cooperate meaningfully with Moscow]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On
a practical level, [there are **[difficulties in sharing
intelligence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[even with trusted
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, much less in a relationship rife with
mistrust, as U.S.-Russia ties now are. More importantly, [the argument
that Moscow and Washington are fighting a common enemy]{.underline}
because both face threats from militant Islamists [is
**misleading**]{.underline}: A close look at the battles each is waging
reveals that [Russia and the U.S. are [fighting]{.mark} either different
groups or the same groups but [for **different reasons**]{.mark} and
[using **very different approaches**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today Russia
is America\'s adversary and its actions, particularly attempts to
fracture NATO, do not align with larger U.S. security goals. Calling
Moscow a "partner" in the counterterror fight would hand it a huge PR
victory---note that the Putin-Trump call was made public by the
Kremlin---and a giant fig leaf to cover up its efforts to undermine the
U.S. on the global stage.

Obstacles to Cooperation

Sharing intelligence with foreign countries is easier said than done.
[[Practical difficulties include]{.mark} concerns about **[revealing
sources and methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as well as **[strict
reg]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark}** [involving]{.mark} access to
[info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [with **varying levels of
classification**]{.underline}. [Clearing these hurdles is even more
difficult in a political climate where U.S.-Russian
**military-to-military contacts are all but frozen**]{.underline} [and
the U.S. intelligence community believes]{.underline} (PDF[) Russia to
have waged "an influence campaign]{.underline} in 2016 [aimed at the
U.S. presidential election,"]{.underline} with several official
investigations underway.

Syria ostensibly would be the place to start on counterterrorism
cooperation, but [Russia has proven to be an **unreliable partner** on
matters less sensitive than intelligence sharing.]{.underline} Earlier
this year, the U.S.-led coalition said Russian military officials had
rejected a coalition request for permission to strike Islamic State
targets near a strategically important garrison at al-Tanf, which is
used by U.S. troops. [[The Pentagon]{.mark} has [**repeatedly
complained** of **dangerous maneuvers**]{.mark} by Russia]{.underline}n
fighter jets, most recently in December. And U.N. investigators say
there is strong evidence suggesting that [[the Russian-brokered]{.mark}
2013 [deal to rid Syria]{.mark} of its chemical weapons [did not
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, while Moscow has blocked related
investigations from continuing. There are also reports that "the
Kremlin\'s diplomatic coordination with the United States is much less
intense" under the Trump administration than under Barack Obama\'s.

[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[remains unclear]{.mark}** exactly
[what Russia could provide]{.mark} to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [of value in terms of intelligence or military
capabilities]{.underline}. [The U.S. is **doing a better job** battling
Islamic State than Russia is. In areas [where Russian]{.mark}-backed
[forces operate,]{.mark} IS [fighters]{.mark} **regularly manage to
[move freely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially around the middle
Euphrates River valley, according to U.S. officials. Moreover, [despite
Putin\'s declaration of "victory]{.underline}" in December,
[[Russia\'s]{.mark} main military [facilities]{.mark} in Syria [were
**attacked**]{.mark} in January]{.underline}---first with mortars
killing two servicemen and then with a dozen armed drones, possibly from
territory covered by a Moscow-brokered cease-fire---[**[demonstrating
the]{.mark} Russian forces\' [vulnerability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Overall, [despite Moscow\'s growing influence in [the Middle
East,]{.mark}]{.underline} [the region [is]{.mark} still [not]{.mark}
one [where Russia has]{.mark} more **[knowledge or sway]{.mark}** than
Washington]{.underline}.

The \'Common Enemy\' Fallacy

[The primary reason U.S.-Russian counterterrorism cooperation is even
under discussion is because of the idea that the two countries are
fighting a common enemy]{.underline}---jihadist groups in general, and
Islamic State in particular. In reality, [Moscow\'s and Washington\'s
respective [wars on terror **differ**]{.mark}
**significantly**]{.underline} [[in motives]{.mark}, aims,
[targets,]{.mark} tactics and [strategies, and]{.mark} even [who the
enemy is,]{.mark} which further dims any prospects for
cooperation]{.underline}.

In Syria, for example, [the U.S. wants to defeat the Islamic State
because it is an **engine of international terrorism**]{.underline},
while [Russia fights]{.underline} the group mainly [because it is an
enemy of President Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}---whose regime Moscow
has saved from collapse. Meanwhile, [[Russian]{.mark} special
[forces]{.mark} and warplanes [serve as a **force multiplier** for
Hezbollah]{.mark}, a recognized terror group]{.underline}. [Differences
like these explain]{.underline} in large part [why [U.S.-Russian
cooperation in Syria has been]{.mark} **limited to ["deconfliction" and
avoiding accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while the two sides\'
definitions of the terrorist threat continue to diverge.

[[Another key difference in]{.underline}]{.mark} the two countries\'
[[threat perceptions]{.mark} is]{.underline} that [[Moscow]{.mark} has
long [had to fight]{.mark} Islamist terrorism **[in its
backyard]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while [the U.S. has been doing battle
in **distant lands**]{.underline}. In the mid- to late-1990s, [myriad
anti-Russian rebel groups,]{.underline} primarily from the traditionally
Muslim North Caucasus region, [adopted religious ideologies]{.underline}
instead of secular separatist aspirations---a shift attributed by many
scholars to the growing influence of foreign fighters from the Middle
East and Central Asia. [Since then, Islamic militants have launched many
high-profile attacks on Russian soil]{.underline} far beyond the
battlefields of the Caucasus. [These have included targeted
destruction]{.underline} of transportation infrastructure and
meticulously planned operations specifically designed to kill civilians
and spread terror throughout the population, such as the Moscow theater
hostage crisis in 2002 and the Beslan school siege in 2004. [The U.S.
has suffered far fewer attacks by jihadists on its home turf and has
been fighting largely to keep them away]{.underline} from its shores
[and to help protect allies]{.underline} in Europe.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} difference, too, [**[calls for different
approaches to counterterrorism]{.underline}**:]{.mark} [Expeditionary
counterterrorism requires a **significant deployment of military
force**, while domestic counterterrorism can rely more on **local and
federal police** and an array of intelligence agencies.]{.underline}

[The U.S. and Russia also **differ markedly** in their approaches to
fighting terrorism and [it is **hard to imagine** how these could
be]{.mark} made **[compatible.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Roughly put, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} aims to espouse a comprehensive approach that **[tries to
win hearts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and minds by finding out about
communities\' grievances and factoring in socioeconomic development;
[[Russia does not]{.mark} explicitly try to do this]{.underline}[,
[relying]{.underline}]{.mark} [instead [on]{.mark} **heavy-handed
methods**]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} of which [the U.S. military
could not easily get away with and in fact condemns.]{.underline}

[These]{.underline} have [included **[indiscriminate
bombing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [forced disappearances whose victims got
no legal representation, were held incommunicado]{.underline} and were
sometimes never heard from again; and [collective
punishment]{.underline}, including the [targeting]{.underline} of
[suspected insurgents\' families, friends and neighbors]{.underline}.
[[Russia\'s focus has been]{.mark} **largely kinetic**]{.underline}, as
[the military has **relied on a decapitation strategy**]{.underline} [to
eliminate successive high-ranking]{.underline} insurgent military
[commanders]{.underline} over the years. [This approach]{.underline} has
been quite effective in the short term, but also [may be myopic,
[trading]{.mark}]{.underline} (PDF) [[long]{.mark}er-[term stability for
short-lived security]{.mark}]{.underline}: [Insurgents\']{.underline}
social, political and [economic grievances have]{.underline} largely
[been ignored]{.underline}, practically [ensuring that future
generations of militants will pick up the mantle of jihad]{.underline}.
In Chechnya, for example, [anti-Moscow militants have been all but wiped
out under a ruthless, Moscow-backed strongman]{.underline}, but the
insurgency has shifted to neighboring Dagestan. Indeed, thousands (PDF)
of [[Russia]{.mark}n fighters have **[gone to wage jihad]{.mark}** in
Syria and Iraq]{.underline} and experts are just beginning to assess the
threats they will pose in years to come.

[In an ideal world Russia and the U.S. would be able to cooperate
against jihadist organizations]{.underline}, jointly developing
counterterrorist best practices, [but]{.underline} for all the reasons
listed above [**this is not realistic** at present.]{.underline}

## Revisionism

### Yes Revisionism\-\--2AC

#### Putin's policy reflects revisionist goals.

**Grigoryan, 22** (Armen Grigoryan, co-founder and vice president of the
Yerevan-based Centre for Policy Studies, 5/23/22, New Eastern Europe - A
bimonthly news magazine dedicated to Central and Eastern European
affairs, \"The war in Ukraine and historical revisionism,\"
<https://neweasterneurope.eu/2022/05/23/the-war-in-ukraine-and-historical-revisionism/>
/alundy)

On April 16th, Russian President Vladimir [Putin signed a law imposing
fines of up to 15 days in jail for equating the USSR and Nazi Germany's
goals]{.underline} and actions during the Second World War. This [law
also covers denial of the USSR's "humanitarian mission during the
liberation of European countries]{.underline}". This is the logical
extension of a law adopted in July, which prohibited these
aforementioned actions but did not mention punitive measures. Before
this, in 2014, public statements containing "false information" about
the USSR's wartime actions or Soviet veterans were criminalised.
An amendment to the country's criminal code imposed large fines or up to
five years imprisonment.

Such [legal amendments are yet another phase in the ongoing consecration
of Soviet victory in the "Great Patriotic War]{.underline}". The victory
is now the principal element in Russia's memory politics, with
corresponding [ideology used to legitimise **militarism** and **great
power ambitions**]{.underline}. These recent developments are not just
another step towards the country's revival of Soviet propaganda
narratives. [They are also intertwined with the Russian aggression in
Ukraine]{.underline} and some of the most tragic events of the ongoing
war. These changes once again demonstrate what can happen when
governments attempt to deny historical crimes through the use of
ideology.

At the same time, this is not very surprising. This became especially
clear to me after receiving a Visegrad Scholarship to study some of the
roots of current Russian policy at the Central European University and
Open Society Archives (OSA) in Budapest.

The OSA collection comprises communist propaganda materials from the
Stalin era to the 1980s, the findings of Ray J. Madden's US Congress
committee on the Katyń massacre, Polish samizdat and émigré press, a
number of western publications, Soviet publications from the late 1980s,
and other materials. Overall, [ƒ]{.underline}. Moscow originally denied
responsibility for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its consequences,
such as the partition of Poland, the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, and the Katyń massacre. The state would only formally admit
its guilt in the Gorbachev era.

A new national myth

However, [a revival of some Soviet narratives began a few years later
under the pretext of fighting against the "falsification of
history]{.underline}". In May 2009, Moscow established the Presidential
Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify
History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests. The then head of the
president's staff, Sergei Naryshkin, was appointed chairman of the
commission. Since 2016, Naryshkin has been the director of the Foreign
Intelligence Service. He recently made international headlines following
an infamous session of Russia's Security Council on February 21st.
During this meeting, he proposed the recognition of the so-called
"Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics" and was ridiculed by Putin.

Soon after the commission's creation, historian Boris
Sokolov predicted rather accurately that [its activities would result in
efforts to suppress information about the Soviet occupation and
annexation of the Baltic states]{.underline}, as well as other crimes
committed by the Soviet regime. He also highlighted the existence of an
official Soviet foreign ministry memorandum published in 1948. This
document was released in response to the publication of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols in [the US and was titled
"Falsifiers of History]{.underline}". The memorandum, which would
provide the basis for Soviet propaganda over the next few decades,
[denied the existence of the secret protocols and stated that Moscow's
pre-war attempts to form a collective security framework had been
undermined by Great Britain and France]{.underline}. As a result, the
USSR was compelled to accept the pact in order to win more time to
better prepare for an unavoidable war with Germany.

[It has also been noted that a gradual return to a **Stalinist
interpretation of history** began]{.underline}, at least in education,
right [at the start of Putin's rule]{.underline}. History textbooks
published in Russia in the 1990s admitted that the USSR's territorial
gains in 1939-40 happened against the will of the peoples of the Baltic
states and Eastern Poland (most of the authors avoided the term
"annexation", likely because it would imply similarities between Stalin
and Hitler's interests and methods). By 2003, however, any mention of
the secret protocols was removed from new textbooks. Since 2007, the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact has been explained in favourable terms, while
Stalin has become revered as an "effective manager".

Soon after the formation of the "falsification of history" commission,
the head of the Russian Defence Ministry's Institute of Military
History, Sergei Kovalev, published an article on the ministry's website.
This asserted that Poland had been responsible for beginning the Second
World War, as it had declined "justified" German demands. Meanwhile, the
USSR needed a non-aggression pact with [Germany and had deployed troops
in the Baltic states in order to improve border security]{.underline}.
The article was deleted from the website the next day and it was
explained that it just represented Kovalev's personal opinion. However,
arguments in favour of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and assertions about
Poland's responsibility for the beginning of the war would be repeated
later -- at a much higher level.

One significant example of the outcomes produced by the commission is a
book published in 2011 by State Duma member Vladimir Medinsky, who would
later continue developing the state's new ideology as minister of
culture. In The War: The Myths of the USSR, 1939-1945, Medinsky
justified the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact using familiar Soviet arguments.
He denied that the USSR was responsible for the Katyń massacre, and so
forth. Medinsky implied that the European Union was to blame for
statements that Stalin had been responsible for the beginning of war,
along with Hitler. A rather characteristic favourable review of
Medinsky's book stated that "Almost everything that liberal journalists
write about nowadays was invented long ago by Dr. Goebbels."

Perhaps most significantly, [the change of rhetoric could be observed in
Putin's statements]{.underline}. While during a visit to Poland in 2009
he had denounced the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as "collusion to solve
one's problems at others' expense", in 2015 he defended it at a joint
press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all the while
blaming western nations. This falls in line with the old Soviet argument
about Great Britain and France's unwillingness to support a collective
security framework. Later on, Putin increasingly appeared obsessed with
keeping the Soviet version of history intact. At a Commonwealth of
Independent States summit in December 2019, he lectured his
counterparts on the causes and events of the Second World War. He made
numerous allusions to Soviet propaganda, including speculation on the
"Munich Betrayal" in an attempt to exonerate the USSR and put the blame
on Great Britain, France and Poland. The extent of Putin's argument led
to a reply from Warsaw's foreign ministry, which highlighted the Soviet
Union's invasion, occupation, deportations and mass killings. This
document also proposed relaunching the Polish-Russian Group for
Difficult Issues that had operated in the 1990s. Another statement on
the issue was later made by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

In June 2020, Putin expanded on his historical argument in a
lengthy article in The National Interest. Among other issues, the piece
implied that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the USSR's actions had been
justified, as the "Munich Betrayal" had meant that the West would deal
with security issues without taking Soviet interests into account. He
also claimed that the USSR entered the war only when it had been
attacked by Germany and praised the Red Army's "liberation mission in
Europe". The Russian leader also defended the post-war division of
Europe by referring, even though indirectly, to the Yalta Conference
agreements. Most absurdly, [the Russian embassy in
Berlin [sent](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-baffles-german-historians-with-request-they-supplement-lectures-with-an-article-by-putin/30690752.html) a
translation of the **revisionist article**]{.underline} to a number of
German professors, asking them to make use of the work in their
lectures.

### Yes Revisionism\-\--1AR

#### Putin's propaganda is grounded in [revisionist tendencies]{.underline}, revising the past.

**Mendel, 22** (Iuliia Mendel journalist, ex-press-secretary to the
President of Ukraine, and communication consultant, 2-20-22, Putin --
the Crude Revisionist who Ignores Lessons of History,\" KyivPost,

/alundy)

[Vladimir Putin wants not only to seize new territories, but to own
history]{.underline}. History often falls victim to autocracies and
dictatorships. [Reshaped historical narratives become compelling
explanations of all-powerful leaders and serve]{.underline} their
**[propaganda]{.underline}** as one of the instruments to preserve and
increase their political weight.

No wonder that Russian President Vladimir Putin comes up with absurdly
manipulated historical facts to push his geopolitical policies. But [it
is more than just lies or manipulation. It is a well-grounded philosophy
that]{.underline} not only **[revises the past]{.underline}**, but also
becomes his instrument to reshape the present.

Isn't that what Putin does when he plays the "independent republics"
card, with which the post-Soviet space that emerged 30 years ago is
generously dotted by his bloody will: South Ossetia in Georgia,
Moscow-created Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics in Ukraine and the
breakaway Transnistria republic in Moldova -- God knows how many more
such black holes the Kremlin leadership can create with the help of
mercenaries and propaganda.

[Putin is **offended** by the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
His love for that bygone era is actively cultivated in Russia even 30
years after its implosion. [Putin manipulates the notion of democracy by
comparing artificially created pseudo-states with the real ones that
constituted the USSR]{.underline}. He may indeed not see the difference
between Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia and the conjured
formations of LPR, DPR, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, or Transnistria. In
this way, [Putin suspends the understanding of freedom as a hostage to
his biggest political intrigue -- the confrontation between the West and
Russia]{.underline}.

According to this primitive formula, if the U.S. once divided the USSR
into some 15 republics, [why can't Russia today break those republics
into smaller ones]{.underline}?

Having amassed nearly 200,000 troops with weapons and military equipment
around Ukraine's southeastern borders, Putin refuses to directly talk
with the political leadership in Kyiv. Literally, he ignores any attempt
at dialogue and sends messages through European interlocutors. This
seems to be his response to the Ukrainian leadership's unwillingness to
negotiate with the Russian installed puppets whose Moscow-armed
formations have been fighting in Ukraine's two easternmost regions of
Luhansk and Donets for nearly eight years.

The parallels are blustering, but quite possible for a man offended by
the historical collapse of the state he seems to consider his homeland,
the USSR, and who is already personally expressing doubts about
Ukraine's sovereignty. "I am convinced that [Ukraine's true sovereignty
is possible precisely in partnership with Russia]{.underline}," Putin
wrote in a diatribe in July 2021.

[Putin acts as if he really sees no difference between the sovereign
state of Ukraine and the quasi-republics that are under his own military
control]{.underline}. It is as if the Russian leader is trying to teach
the world a lesson by creating imitations and empty simulacra on copies
of real historical facts.

Putin's version of history distorts understandable values to help manage
his own country. If you don't know how to create, then "protect" and
take away. Russia's hybrid or covert invasions of Ukraine's Crimean
Peninsula and Georgia's Abkhazia, and Moldova's Transnistria province
under the guise of "protection" was done against phantom enemies he
conjured.

Isn't this what happened to the Soviet Union? While the West was
recovering from World War II, building democracy and competitive market
economies, the USSR was building tanks to defend itself and intimidating
its own people with U.S. aggression. A Ukrainian diplomat who survived
Stalin's death as a child recounted how his entire family stayed awake,
gazing up into the night sky. "We waited that every second we could see
American missiles that were going to destroy us," he recalled vividly
for the rest of his life.

[The Soviet Union, in fact, was built on falsehoods, **lies**, and
**unrealistic, artificial ideals**. Putin is deliberately repeating this
failed scheme and therefore risks his empire falling just as
loudly.]{.underline}

#### Russia is revisionist \-\-- it is transparent in its intentions to regain power and overthrow the international hierarchy

/alundy)

On the assumptions that changing the status quo is the basic aim of a
revisionist strategy (Buzan, 2008) and that acceptance of the risks
involved in the use of force is a key factor in distinguishing the
different forms of revisionism (Schweller, 2015), this study puts
forward a new typology of revisionism. The six types identified are
based on three dimensions: the means employed (peaceful/violent), the
nature of the objectives (territory/norms/power), and the level of
action (regional/global). The introduction of a new typology of
revisionism can also stimulate further research on the possible change
of goals, means, and level of action of the potential claims of the
revisionist powers that have economic and military capabilities to act
both regionally and globally to change the status quo (see the case of
Russia, China and, according to some scholars, the United States).
Further research insights can be derived from the application of
normative revisionism to the various empirical cases (see the Arab
countries and the developing). Our [empirical analysis]{.underline}, in
particular, [confirms the importance of the level of action as a new
element]{.underline} with respect to previous typologies and [makes it
possible not only to demonstrate the central part played by the military
option in Russian strategy inside and outside the post-Soviet space but
also and above all to confirm the escalation of the revisionist

interventions in Georgia and Ukraine, [and]{.underline} at [the global
level]{.underline} with the intervention in Syria. The respectively
nationalist (Georgia and Ukraine) and radical (Syria) nature of the
interventions emerges in relation both to the means and the level of
action of these interventions, and to the objectives. In Georgia and
Ukraine, Russia obtained the control and/or annexation of territories
like South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea, strengthened its position with
respect to neighbouring countries, and impeded the expansion of NATO and
the EU. In Syria it obtained control of the port of Tartus, ended the
American monopoly in the war on terrorism by asserting itself as a
strong party to the peace negotiations, challenged American interests in
the Middle East by strengthening the Assad regime, and clearly
manifested its determination to halt the decline that set in after 1989.
[The dual nature of Russia's objectives]{.underline} -- both territorial

As matters now stand, any talk of American decline at the military level
is misleading and empirically incorrect. It is, however, [necessary to
take the readiness to use military force as our starting point if we are
to understand the nature and the consequences of Russian revisionism at
the global level]{.underline}. A power in a position of hegemony cannot
in fact hesitate to use all of the diplomatic, economic, and military
means at its disposal in order to preserve its status and prevent any
destabilizing threats from calling it into question. The USA has made
systematic use of force since 1989 to preserve its spheres of influence
all over the world and eliminate threats (from figures like Milosevic,
Saddam Hussein, and Qaddafi) to the stability of the liberal world order
on which its indisputable supremacy rested. Where it intervened
militarily, with or without a resolution of the UN Security Council, [it
told the rest of the world that it was the only actor authorized -- or
rather self-authorized -- to intervene in defence,]{.underline} at least
formally, of human rights at the expense of national sovereignty.
[Russia's revisionism is the child of this strategy]{.underline}. In
order to alter the status quo in its favour, [Putin has]{.underline}
operated on at both the regional and the global levels to oppose
American expansion in the post-Soviet space and its version of
humanitarian intervention all over the world, not hesitating to use
force in order to challenge the United States [openly]{.underline} and

regional level, Georgia and Ukraine have been blocked. Their entry into

of a frontal clash with Moscow. At the global level, the effects of
Russia's strategy will have to be assessed in the medium and long terms.

wants to play a decision-making part once again]{.underline} in the
management of world affairs. It also wants a less centralized system

### Yes Revisionism\-\--Hybrid War\-\--1AR

/alundy)

The rise of digital diplomacy has provided state actors new venues to
promote their national interests. Twitter specifically has emerged as a
"megaphone and substantive communications medium"\[1\] for heads of
state, governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
and scholars. [The Russian Federation has exploited the growing
importance of social media platforms to diplomacy in order to seek
legitimization and normalization]{.underline} of its 2014 annexation of
Crimea, which is recognized almost universally as Ukrainian
territory.\[2\] Despite a robust digital campaign, the percentage of
Ukrainians that believe Crimea is Russian territory has actually
decreased since 2014. Furthermore, Russia's social media activity has
not strengthened its claim to Crimea, but it does provide insight into
how the state uses emerging technologies below the threshold of war to
meet strategic objectives.

Background

When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine found itself in possession of
the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Encouraged by both the
United States and Russia, Ukraine forewent the arsenal for international
security guarantees protecting its independence and territorial
sovereignty, as outlined in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.\[3\] In 2014,
Russia breached these security guarantees by invading and annexing the
Crimean Peninsula after the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych during the Revolution of Dignity (known internationally as
the Euromaidan Revolution). The annexation was swiftly condemned,\[4\]
with world leaders pointing to international law as the foundation of
their argument against a perceived act of aggression. Russian President
Vladimir Putin responded that the security guarantees made in the early
1990s were only valid with the pre-revolution Ukrainian government,
insinuating that the post-Euromaidan government was leading a "new"\[5\]
state, and that the Russian military had an obligation to protect ethnic
Russians from the "nationalist junta"\[6\] in Kyiv. With most of the
international community rejecting these justifications, [Russia launched
a **revisionist information campaign** to legitimize
occupation]{.underline} of the peninsula.

[Increased use of social media has led to a **proliferation** of
**historical revisionism** and reframing of current events, though the
Kremlin is not a rookie when it comes to contorting the narrative around
its behavior]{.underline}. For example, Moscow has long attempted to
erase the Red Army's mass murder of nearly 22,000 Polish soldiers in
1943 in Katyn, Russia by focusing conversations on the destruction of
the Belorussian village, Khatyn, by occupying Nazi forces.\[7\] It
wasn't until 1990 that the Soviets admitted the Red Army was
"responsible for the murders,"\[8\] despite Kremlin-sponsored social
media accounts, such as the Russian Mission to the EU account
(@RusMission_EU) denying this fact as recently as May 2020.\[9\] Russia
utilizes internet trolls,\[10\] bots,\[11\] and state-affiliated social
media accounts to shape narratives by targeting naïve social media users
who either inadvertently perpetuate falsehoods or rely on an extreme
form of confirmation bias\[12\] in which they only receive and re-share
content they agree with.

Russia's Digital Activity

In recent years, Russia has honed its social media tactics alongside a
contingency of its other information warfare practices. [Russia's
**information warfare** against Ukraine]{.underline} was described in
2014 by U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove as the "[most amazing
information warfare blitzkrieg]{.underline}."\[13\] Social media plays a
significant role in the Russian information warfare strategy as it
provides "cheap, efficient, and highly effective access"\[14\] to
audiences while maintaining plausible deniability for the Kremlin. The
conditions of the social media environment---sense of anonymity, reach,
and speed---provide unique challenges to combating information campaigns
on such platforms. Social media platforms allow trolls and bots to
congregate with real individuals that can be separated into three
categories: (1) "useful idiots," who unknowingly give credibility to
Russian propaganda and objectives; (2) "fellow travelers," who are
Russian and Kremlin sympathizers, and; (3) "agent provocateurs," who are
actively being manipulated by the Russian government.\[15\]
Collectively, these individuals and accounts provide ample ground for
the Kremlin to engage in narrative-shaping and other disinformation
campaigns.

Twitter and other social media present opportunities to the Russian
government to [export its historical and **political narratives** to
both foreign governments and private citizens in every corner of the
world]{.underline}. Those not privy to Ukrainian-Russian relations,
international law, or the underlying forces of the 2014 Revolution of
Dignity may be more susceptible to Russian propaganda that "Crimea is
Russia" and that Russia invaded to "protect Crimea" from the
"nationalist junta" that is the post-Euromaidan government.\[16\] These
individuals may promote these views, providing attention to Russia's
stance, further legitimizing and normalizing it. Furthermore, such
attention confirms the biases of pro-Russia activists who seek
validation of their views online.\[17\] Political pundits may also
accidentally or purposefully contribute to this bias. A November 2019
clip\[18\] of American political commentator Tucker Carlson asking, "Why
shouldn't I root for Russia? And I am," regarding the ongoing war in
eastern Ukraine went viral and was largely met with condemnation from a
variety of Twitter users. Carlson in this instance was a "useful
idiot,"\[19\] and the confidence his comment might provide to pro-Russia
activists, while difficult to quantify, should be considered.

[Nor is Russia likely to stop there. Spreading instability is a central
tenet of]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin's **hybrid warfare
doctrine**]{.underline}, and there is every reason to believe this
includes creating greater turbulence in Europe. The Russian president
has recently called the borders of all the former Soviet republics into
question, [[claiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNEb9VZvzw&feature=youtu.be) that
numerous unspecified republics left the USSR while in possession of
"historically Russian lands]{.underline}." [This]{.underline} thinly
veiled [threat is not limited to Ukraine, Belarus, or
Kazakhstan]{.underline}. It also applies to the three Baltic nations,
which are all EU and NATO member states.

[Putin underlined his]{.underline} ominously [imperial
thinking]{.underline} towards the Baltic states in a June
2020 [article](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/vladimir-putin-real-lessons-75th-anniversary-world-war-ii-162982) for
The National Interest that allowed the Russian ruler to share his
profoundly unapologetic view of Soviet conduct during WWII. He described
the 1940 invasion and annexation of the Baltic states as "the
incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia," before going on go
claim, "their accession to the USSR was implemented on a contractual
basis, with the consent of the elected authorities." [Comments of this
nature expose the grim reality of **Putin's revisionist
worldview**]{.underline}, [regardless of]{.underline} the [wishful
thinking]{.underline} that many of Ukraine's partners would prefer to
believe.

This raises a number of important questions. To what degree is the West
aware of the challenge it faces? Does the West recognize that spreading
turbulence closer to the heart of Europe is part and parcel of Russia's
strategy? Should Europe help to create a fault line that runs from the
Baltic States to the Black Sea? This is no metaphor, nor is it an
exaggeration.

[The experience of recent years should already have been sufficient to
convince Western leaders that appeasement is not an effective way to
address the security challenges presented by Putin's
Russia]{.underline}. Failure to confront the Kremlin in Crimea in early
2014 [has only encouraged greater **Russian boldness**]{.underline}.
Moscow has expanded its military presence everywhere from Syria to
Libya, while at the same time broadening the scope of its hybrid war
operations throughout North America, the European Union and beyond.

With examples of Russian aggression increasing in the international
arena, the Western world must decide where to draw the line. Ukraine
faces no such dilemmas -- the country is committed to defending every
inch of its territory, even if that means doing so alone. Western
leaders can either commit to helping Ukraine defend itself, or face the
consequences on their own territory in the near future.

At present, [the Western world seems unsure of how best to contain a
resurgent and revisionist Russia]{.underline}. As the front line nation
in the current confrontation, [Ukraine is the most obvious focus for
containment strategies]{.underline}. In practical terms, this means
revisiting the Minsk Process and adapting the framework of the current
dialogue to reflect geopolitical realities. Now is not the time to cling
dogmatically to existing arrangements. On the contrary, [creative
approaches are required in order to safeguard global security and
prevent further European destabilization.]{.underline}

As well as supporting a pragmatic approach to implementation of the
Minsk Agreements, [Western leaders should also revisit the role and
functions of]{.underline} the international [security
institutions]{.underline} involved in the Ukraine peace process. For
example, the OSCE has never deployed peacekeepers on a large scale to
neutralize a conflict. The time may now be ripe for such a move. We are
fully aware of the gravity of the challenge, but a successful outcome
would be significant for the entire continent. This would require real
leadership and could be a special task for Sweden, which will chair the
OSCE in 2021.

If the usual coalitions do not work, we in Ukraine should think about
creating new ones and attracting new allies.

The search for new models across various international platforms should
be coupled with expanded bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and all
countries invested in restoring peace in Europe and preserving it for
the wider world. Ukraine has recently progressed to the next stage in
its relations with NATO. We are ready to affirm Ukraine's new Enhanced
Opportunity
Partner [status](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/nato-upgrades-ukraine/) in
collective as well as bilateral security models. This could mean
recognizing Ukraine as a Major Non-NATO Ally, for example.

[The deteriorating international security]{.underline} climate since
2014 [is testament to the failure of the present policies towards a
**revisionist** Russia. There is]{.underline} evidently [a need to
identify]{.underline} and implement new [models that can ensure peace
and contain the Kremlin]{.underline}. The most pragmatic approach to
this challenge lies in greater support for Ukrainian sovereignty and
territorial integrity via the modification of the failing Minsk Process.
Further delays will only lead to additional costs.

### Yes Revisionism\-\--Ukraine\-\--1AR

#### Ukraine uniquely proves \-\-- Russia bases their rhetoric in historical revisionism to justify invasion.

**Serhan, 22** (Yasmeen Serhan is a staff writer at The Atlantic,
2-27-22, Who Is Vladimir Putin's Revisionist History For?, The Atlantic,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/putin-russia-ukraine-revisionist-history/622936/>
/alundy)

Putin is not the only world leader who has harkened back to an
ahistorical past to justify his decisions in the present. [Right-wing
nationalists [around the
world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/02/11/history-patriotism-right-wing-politics/) have
sought to portray themselves as the primary defenders of a glorious past
that their enemies would seek to deny or forget]{.underline}.
By [whitewashing uncomfortable
legacies](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/30/the-kremlin-is-trying-to-whitewash-russias-stalinist-past-a67096) and
seeking to cultivate a politics of [historic
grievance](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-rues-soviet-collapse-demise-historical-russia-2021-12-12/),
Putin has attempted the same. But in his justification for the invasion
of Ukraine, [Putin's ahistoricism has bordered on
**delusion**]{.underline}. Whether the Russian people or the rest of the
world share in it, for now, appears to be immaterial: If there's one
audience this revisionist history is designed for, it's Putin himself.

[The evolution of **Putin's** historical **revisionism** can be seen
throughout his public statements over the years]{.underline}. In 2005,
he famously [described](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7632057) the
collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of
the 20th century. Two years later,
Putin [bemoaned](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/24034) the
aftermath of the Soviet era and the pernicious, unipolar world---one led
not by Moscow, but by Washington---that it had created. Last year, in
perhaps the clearest articulation of his worldview, Putin said that
Ukrainians and Russians are "[one people---a single
whole](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843)." On Monday, he
took that sentiment even further, [declaring Ukraine to be "an
**inalienable** part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space"
whose independence was]{.underline} a product not of self-determination
(Ukrainians resoundingly voted in favor of independence from the Soviet
Union in a [1991
referendum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/25-years-independence-the-ukrainian-referendum)),
but rather ["a **mistake**]{.underline}."

Unlike his [2014
address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l10BsQzOGKM) announcing
Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was largely framed as a moment of
celebration, this was an angry speech---one ostensibly designed to make
Russia's people angry too, and to justify what was to come. "In
territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to note is our historical
land, a hostile 'anti-Russia' is taking shape," Putin said in another
address ahead of the invasion. "For our country, it is a matter of life
and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation."

It's hard to know what Putin means by historical future (which is, on
its face, an oxymoron), though we can take an educated guess. When Putin
speaks of Russia today, [he speaks of a country whose greatness is
defined by its past]{.underline}---namely, [its **imperial
history**]{.underline} and its victory during World War II---which he
believes [must guide its present]{.underline}. "Putin weaponized history
by giving it a function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine
Forum at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told me. As far as
the Russian president is concerned, "history is the fortune teller of
the future."

Such [historical narratives can]{.underline} be
[compel]{.underline}ling, especially when they elicit [the kind of
**nostalgic nationalism**]{.underline} that has proved potent elsewhere,
including in the United States (where Donald Trump's Republican Party
has dubbed itself the defender of ["patriotic
education"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/trump-patriotic-education.html)),
India (where Hindu nationalists have appealed to pride in India's past
to undermine its secular present), and Hungary (where Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán
often [invokes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/03/how-viktor-orban-turned-century-hungarian-history-into-secret-weapon/) the
territories the country lost after the First World War). "Putin is not
the only person who is old enough to have felt that sense of deep,
personalized humiliation and shame that came with the loss of power of
the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War," Keir Giles, the author
of [​​Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia to Confront the
West](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780815735748), told me. "Anything
that [reasserts Russia as that great power with a greater status than
others and the right to a global presence and global influence in
others' affairs]{.underline} will be popular in those sectors of the
Russian population."

Still, it's difficult to gauge just how big that sector is or how
pervasive the narrative has been among those who don't share Putin's
semi-mythological view of history. A recent [CNN
poll](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/02/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-poll-intl/),
published the day before the start of Moscow's military invasion of
Ukraine, found that though roughly half of Russians support using
military force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, only 36 percent
support doing so as a means of forcing a reunification of the two
countries. The lack of support for the latter was most clearly evidenced
by [anti-war
protests](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2022/02/photos-anti-war-protests-russia/622914/) that
have broken out across Russian cities.

When I spoke with Denis Volkov, the director of the Moscow-based Levada
Center, Russia's last independent pollster, in early February, he told
me that though the majority of Russians fear war, few would feel
comfortable voicing opposition to it if it came due to fear of
reprisals. Indeed, more than [1,700
arrests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/we-dont-want-this-russians-react-to-the-ukraine-invasion?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Othe) have
already been made. Besides, Volkov said, "public opinion will be no
limit to the Russian government."

Though Putin may feel obliged to justify his war of choice to the
Russian people, who with Ukrainians will share the costs of a bloody and
drawn-out conflict, [his revisionist history is designed to
appeal]{.underline} to no one more so than himself. By restoring
Russia's control over its former territories, [Putin not only corrects
what he sees as a historic wrong but also cements his place in Russian
history as the leader who restored the country to its rightful
status.]{.underline}

The irony is that in his quest to make Russia great again, he risks
achieving just the opposite. Invading Ukraine has already resulted
in [wide-ranging
sanctions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/sanctions-against-russia-at-a-glance-people-organisations-uk-us-eu) and
has all but ensured Russia's diplomatic isolation. Even Putin's friends
in Europe, such
as [Orbán](https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1497099482965721103?s=20&t=imIB8HpI9TF87fiiLNyf0g) and
Czech President [Milos
Zeman](https://www.reuters.com/business/czech-president-russia-should-be-cut-off-swift-2022-02-24/),
have gone out of their way to reiterate their support for Ukraine and
their commitment to a joint European Union stance.

"Putin's views have become more and more extreme over time to the point
where they are now more or less unrecognizable and have few points of
contact with history as it's understood in the outside world," Giles
said. "He's operating in a different plane of reality and in a different
century."

[White House has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of presenting
a version of revisionist history in his Victory Day speech]{.underline}.
As Putin used the occasion of Soviet victory to defend his Special
Military Operation on Ukraine, US Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that
[his words distorted facts]{.underline}. On Monday, the Russian Czar
addressed his countrymen from Red Square in Moscow but refrained from
announcing victory over Ukraine. 

Following the same, Psaki said, "But what I will say is that what we saw
[President Putin]{.underline} do is [give a version of revisionist
history that took the form of disinformation that we have seen too
commonly as the Russian playbook]{.underline}." 

"You know, our view is that we should remember --- and this is why I did
this at the top --- what this day is actually about, which is something
that we have all celebrated, which is the defeat of Nazis in --- after
World War Two, something that Russians have celebrated in the streets
for many years,\" she added. 

\'Patently False\' 

In his speech, [Putin blamed the West for triggering the ongoing
conflict in Ukraine and said that NATO threatened the security
of]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n Federation. \"Russia called on
the West for an honest dialogue, to search for reasonable, compromise
solutions, to take into account each other\'s interests. All in vain.
The NATO countries did not want to hear us, which means that they had
completely different plans. The danger grew every day. Russia gave a
pre-emptive rebuff to aggression. It was a forced, timely, and the only
right decision. The decision of a sovereign, strong, independent
country,\" [Putin]{.underline} said. However, Psaki said that hi[s claim
was "absurd" and "patently false."]{.underline} 

On the other hand, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelsnkyy vowed to
defeat Russia on Monday. He said, \"Very soon there will be two Victory
Days in Ukraine and someone will not have any.\" Marching on Khreschatyk
Street in the country\'s capital Kyiv, he spoke about two victory days
referring to triumph in world war II as well as Ukraine\'s victory in
the ongoing war. The embattled leader said that his countrymen will win
the war because they are fighting for their children. "We won then. We
will win now. And Khreshchatyk will see the victory parade -- the
Victory of Ukraine!" he claimed.

This is a somber moment for all of us. The Albert Hirschman Centre on
Democracy, like everyone else in this room, is committed to a just,
democratic, inclusive, and rules-based international order. This order
is now beset by fresh and dangerous uncertainties. In co-hosting [this
event](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/communications/news/town-hall-war-ukraine) we
would like to underscore the importance of this commitment as we try to
grapple with the dangerous uncertainties caused by Russia's unjustified
and brutal invasion of Ukraine.

[Russia has been a revisionist power since the 1990s]{.underline}. Its
[invasion of Ukraine could be a signal that it is now embarked on a
dangerously revanchist project]{.underline}. Time alone will tell how
this revanchist tendency might unfold. [A revanchist war in Ukraine
risks being prolonged]{.underline}, [it can also spread and escalate to
threaten the entire world]{.underline}. I must underline this obvious
point because the European dimension of the crisis has attracted
attention. But in the last 250 years, Europe has been remarkably
unsuccessful in containing conflicts in Europe to wars within Europe. So
[the whole world has a right to be concerned]{.underline}.

A 'just, democratic, inclusive, and rules-based international order' is
not just a mouthful. It can be an oxymoron. A just, democratic, and
inclusive international order has to be rules-based. It cannot be
otherwise. But there is no reason, a priori, why a rules-based order
should necessarily be just, democratic, or inclusive. [The international
order at any point in time is a constitutional settlement reflecting
power relations at its moment of origin]{.underline}. It changes slowly,
if at all, and often conditionally or contingently, as power equations
change.

[Revisionist projects, and resistance to them, are therefore the stuff
of international relations, and intrinsic to the international order and
its dynamics.]{.underline} Most such projects play by the rules. Brazil,
Germany, India, and South Africa have been campaigning unsuccessfully
for years to expand the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They can lead to institutional innovations: after failing to reform the
governance of multilateral financial institutions, China decided to set
up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank which is now backed by
nearly 100 countries, among them five members of G7. The Bandung
conference of 1955 was feared in the West as a move to set up a
parallel, non-Western United Nations. But despite problems with the UN
system, this remains unthinkable so long as we have hopes of reforming
it.
