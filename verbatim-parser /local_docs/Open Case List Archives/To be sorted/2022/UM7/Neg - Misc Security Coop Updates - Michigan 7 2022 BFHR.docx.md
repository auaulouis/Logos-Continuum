DOD has long played a crucial role in the implementation of Title 22
security assistance programs and activities, but for many decades, it
otherwise relegated the training, equipping, and assisting of foreign
military forces as a secondary mission on its list of priorities, far
below
war-fighting.[1](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45091.html#fn1) Beginning
in the 1980s, Congress [began providing DOD with additional authority in
Title 10 of the U.S. Code]{.underline} and annual NDAAs to conduct a
range of programs and activities **[funded by DOD
appropriations]{.underline}**. Congress began providing such authorities
in the 1980s for counternarcotics and humanitarian assistance; authority
for nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs was subsequently
added in the 1980s and 1990s.

Discussion of military and related assistance to foreign countries is
sometimes hindered by a lack of a standard terminology.9 The following
terms are frequently used to describe assistance to foreign governments,
security services, and militaries:

Security Assistance (Title 22). Although not defined in Title 22 of U.S.
Code, the term security assistance is commonly used to refer to the six
budget accounts for which the State Department requests international
security assistance appropriations and whose underlying authorities
reside in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA, P.L. 87-195) and Arms
Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA, P.L. 90-629), as amended.10

**[Security Cooperation]{.underline}** (Title 10). [DOD uses the term
security cooperation to refer to activities authorized by provisions in
Title 10 **and**]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Acts
(**[NDAAs]{.underline}**). The FY2017 [NDAA defines security cooperation
as \"any program, activity]{.underline} (including an exercise), [or
interaction of the Department of Defense with the security establishment
of a foreign country to achieve a purpose as follows:]{.underline}

[To build and develop allied and friendly security capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations.]{.underline}

[To provide the armed forces with access to the foreign country during
peacetime or a contingency operation.]{.underline}

[To build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests]{.underline}.\"11

Security Sector Assistance. In April 2013, the Obama Administration
issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23). The directive called
for an overhaul of U.S. security sector assistance policy and for the
creation of a new interagency framework for planning, implementing,
assessing, and overseeing security sector assistance. The term security
sector assistance refers to all State Department security assistance
programs and virtually all DOD security cooperation programs, exercises,
and engagements, as well as related activities of USAID, DOJ, and other
agencies.12

**Yazici 20** \[Ayşe Meriç Yazici, Ph.D. Student, İstanbul Aydın
University Post Graduate Education Institute, 04-21-2020, "An
Investigation on The Economic Feasibility of Space Elevator"
<https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/1245981> DOA:
7/25/2022 //ArchanSen\]

Design has a significant effect while constructing a space elevator.
[Researchers believe that [it is possible to have a]{.mark} working
[sp]{.mark}ace [elevator]{.mark} with 5 tons of load bearing capacity to
LEO orbit **in 15 years**]{.underline}. [This will lower down the
travelling costs]{.underline} to the Moon, Mars, Venus or asteroids from
the first orbit [to a great extent.]{.underline} Depending on the target
and the choice of rocket launch system for the first space elevator;
lifting costs are estimated to be decreased down to 100 \$. [[The later
extensions]{.mark} and larger elevators [will]{.mark} sooner or later
[make]{.mark} manned and commercial [activities possible on
large-scale]{.mark} as they will **diminish the costs for the
elevator**]{.underline} (Future Pundit, 2003).

Any object in GEO orbit has a potential gravitational energy of about 50
MJ (15 kWh). A space elevator using 0.5% efficiency of power
transportation with wholesale electricity prices from 2008 to 2009 will
require 220 US dollar/kg only as the cost of electricity. Edwards, PhD
have high hopes for technical advancement to increase the level of
efficiency to 2% (Edwards, 2003). Since the space elevators receive a
limited efficiency, launching price can be subjected to the market.

In the 55th International Space Congress, it was suggested that
[[a]{.mark} prestigiously acceptable [mega project for sp]{.mark}ace
[elevators]{.mark} has an estimate [cost]{.mark} of **[6.2 billion US
\$.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This is not much as compared to other mega
projects such as bridges, pipelines, tunnels, maglev trains, launching
vehicles etc (Raitt and Edwards, 2004).

[[Edwards also suggests]{.mark} that [it will cost **6 billion
dollars**]{.mark} to build a space elevator]{.underline}. This can be
compared with project Skylon -- one-layer orbit space plane with a
loading capacity of 12.000 kg, which is estimated to require an R&D and
production cost of about 15 billion \$ (Edwards and Westling, 2002). The
vehicle has a tag price of about 3.000\$ /kg. Skylon will also be
available to launch people and load into LEO orbit and GEO orbit points
(Scott-Scott et al, 2003). SpaceX Starship is another alternative
designed to be used for a similar purpose. Its cargo capacity is between
100 and 150 tons. Its R&D cost is 10 billion \$. Starship crew will also
cost about 200 million \$ and for Starship tanker, the cost is estimated
to be 130 million \$ and 230 million dollar for Super Heavy. The system
has a price tag lower than 140 \$ / kg, which is 47 \$ economic (SpaceX,
2012). It can also carry 100 people to Mars (Dinkin, 2017).

7\. CONCLUSION

In this paper, the Economic Feasibility of Space Elevator has analyzed
to some level. Despite its greatness and complexity, [[the
concept]{.mark} of the space elevator [does not seem]{.mark} to be [so
impossible]{.mark}. These elevators will certainly make the space more
accessible and be a mega structure]{.underline} like the Great Wall and
the pyramids. Although it requires profound financial investment; **[its
benefits will outweigh the initial financial costs once it is
built]{.underline}**. [[They will]{.mark} eventually [lower the costs
for]{.mark} asteroid mining, space logistics, space tourism, space
travel and **[space col]{.mark}onization**; all of [which will be the
mankind's basic needs to **survive soon.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Even
when this enormous mega structure comes to life, it will bring many
possible questions. How will we ever be able to protect this
state-of-the-art structure from the external threats? Questions such as
how to protect the space elevator from any natural disaster that will
suddenly occur in the world will always be the questions to be
considered.

#### It's possible [by 2030]{.underline} with [sustained growth]{.underline}

Victor **Tangermann**, 10-17-20**17**, \"A timeline for humanity\'s
colonization of space,\"
https://futurism.com/a-timeline-for-humanitys-colonization-of-space

[Humans have long desired to explore the vast realms of
space]{.underline}. Today, **[we are [finally poised to send
people]{.mark} out [into the cosmos]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, [a
number of [private and public space companies are gearing up for Space
Race 2.0]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a (very expensive) competition that
inches us closer to uncovering answers about our universe and exploring
new realms of our own humanity. [Though they are still in the race,
shifting priorities and limited budgets have undermined NASA's lead in
exploring the solar system and beyond.]{.underline} In the meantime,
[private entities like [SpaceX and Virgin Galactic are flush with
cash]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and they are stepping up to try and
engineer better, bigger, and faster rockets]{.underline}. And this is a
good thing because, if humans are to find life on other planets, or
perhaps a new planet for ourselves, more work needs to be done.
Engineers and scientists need to develop life support systems, find
reliable sources of water and fuel, overcome the negative effects living
in space has on the body, and find a faster way to travel. [There is
still much to be done, but sending the average person to the Moon and
beyond no longer seems so far out of reach]{.underline}. Yet, when will
it finally happen? When will humans finally roam across an alien world?
Here's a comprehensive timeline of our future beyond Earth. Late 2017:
Heavy Falcon Launch SpaceX plans to launch the Falcon Heavy for the
first time before the end of 2017. Because the rocket can be reused, the
Falcon Heavy rocket can deliver its payload into space at only a third
of the cost of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy.
This [[lower upfront cost means]{.mark} that [more]{.mark} organizations
[can carry out experiments]{.mark} in outer space]{.underline}. One of
these experiments is the Planetary Society's LightSail 2 solar sail that
will launch on board a Heavy Falcon in early 2018. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy
rocket lives up to its name. 27 rocket engines weigh down the 70-meter
(229-foot), 1.4-metric-ton (3.1-million-pound) rocket. That's a lot of
extra weight, but the payload makes it worthwhile --- the rocket can
launch 63,800 kg (140,660 lbs) of equipment, cargo, and passengers into
orbit around Earth. That's more than double the weight that the Space
Shuttle can haul to the same altitude. 2018: Preparing For Space Tourism
In 2018, SpaceX plans to launch more than ever before, sending 30
rockets into orbit (up from 20 in 2017). More attempts give the company
more data to show how it can perfect its technology to launch rockets
cheaply and securely. Eventually, this inexpensive and safe spaceflight
will make space tourism finally viable. In fact, just this year, SpaceX
announced that they would be sending two humans to orbit the Moon in
2018. Image Credit: Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic is gearing up to
launch its first astronauts into space before the end of February 2018.
Before it launches with passengers on board, though, the spacecraft will
have to undergo a series of test flights. The space plane, called the
VSS Unity, completed its fifth 'glide flight' (distinct from the
vertical trajectory of traditional space rockets) earlier in 2017. In
the first months of 2018, it will be taking flights closer to the
Karaman line, the official border between the Earth's atmosphere and
outer space located 100 km (62 miles) above the Earth's surface. Image
Credit: Planetary Society Around that same time in early 2018,
scientists will test the LightSail 2, a device that moves through space
by harnessing the power of solar photons --- no fuel tanks or thrusters
required. The LightSail 2, a citizen-funded spacecraft and created by
the Planetary Society (the largest nonprofit organization that promotes
the exploration of outer space), would be a proof of concept that solar
sailing could propel spacecraft deeper into space. The unmanned,
light-propelled spacecraft will hitch a ride on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy
rocket before taking its test flight at an altitude of 720 km (447.4
miles). 2019: Space Tourism And Observation Image Credit: Blue Origin
Blue Origin, the spaceflight services company started by Amazon founder
Jeff Bezos, recently announced that it intends to take tourists to space
before April 2019. In groups of six, passengers will board an 18-meter
(60-foot) rocket to the edge of space, around 100 km (62 miles) from the
Earth's surface. Once there, they will experience zero-gravity flight.
Three independent parachutes and a retro-thrust system ensure that
passengers will gently sail back to Earth. This experience does not come
cheap --- a ticket to board the New Glenn to reach Earth orbit is
rumored to cost anywhere between \$150,000 and \$250,000. And, yet,
there's little question that people will want to sign up --- Virgin
Galactic, a competing space tourism project, reportedly already has 700
people signed up. In 2019, Blue Origin plans to add two- and three-stage
rockets to its arsenal. They are fully reusable, up to 99 meters (326
feet) tall, and can deliver payloads at a relatively low cost, competing
with SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rockets. Image Credit: NASA NASA also intends
to launch its James Webb Telescope in the first quarter of 2019. The
telescope will observe the solar system in the infrared to see every
phase of the solar system's maturation; it will ultimately be 100 times
more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, thanks to its array of 18
hexagonal mirror segments. With a combined mirror diameter of 6.5 meters
(the Hubble measures in at only 2.4), the James Webb Telescope will be
able to detect events such as the formation of galaxies dating back to
the time of the Big Bang. It will also have a special focus on
discovering new planets that could be capable of supporting life.
2020-2025: "Earth Reliant" And Beyond From finding evidence of liquid
water to detecting organic matter in the soil of the Red Planet's
surface, the Curiosity rover has answered some fundamental questions
about what it's like on Mars. However, that information has also sparked
more questions about what other elements may be present. To this end, in
an effort to establish whether oxygen is present in the Martian
atmosphere, and at what concentration, Curiosity's successor, the Mars
2020 rover, will be saddled with a host of sensors and instruments that
will allow it to answer this question. Information about oxygen
concentration will be important if [[humans are]{.mark} ever [able to
visit the Red Planet]{.mark} themselves, which could be **possible [as
early as 2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are other things that need
to happen if we're going to colonize other planets. [NASA has
established three phases]{.underline} that we need to complete before
this is possible. In the first, which NASA calls "Earth Reliant," we
continue to test the feasibility of living in space and conduct more
research aboard the ISS. In the second ("Proving Ground"), operations
around the Moon will be used to establish ways to return humans to the
Earth safely. With those stages complete, we will finally reach the
third stage ("Earth Independent") in which humans establish a
self-sufficient colony on Mars. Image Credit: NASA Just over 50 years
after humans first touched the lunar surface, NASA is gearing up to
launch another manned spacecraft to go beyond the Moon. The astronauts
will be on board a ship called the Orion, which will lift off using
NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), a modular heavy launch vehicle. SLS is
similar to SpaceX's Heavy Falcon and has a maximum payload of 70 to 130
metric tons (150,000 to 290,000 lbs). First, though, the spacecraft will
do a few test runs without any humans on board. The first mission,
Exploration Mission-1, is slated for late 2018. The SLS will launch the
unmanned craft, travel to the Moon, enter orbit about 100 km (62 miles)
above the lunar surface, and use gravity to propel itself into deep,
unexplored space. The goal of this mission is to see if the craft can
help humans survive a trip to distant planets. The second mission
(Exploration Mission-2), planned for August 2021, will be NASA's first
manned test flight beyond the Moon. "During this mission, we have a
number of tests designed to demonstrate critical functions, including
mission planning, system performance, crew interfaces, and navigation
and guidance in deep space," Bill Hill, the deputy associated
administrator of Exploration Systems Development at NASA Headquarters
said in a 2016 NASA blog. To gain enough momentum to make the trip
around the Moon, the spacecraft will have to make multiple orbits around
Earth, occasionally igniting its thrusters. During its stable orbit of
the Moon, the Orion will gather data and test the spacecraft's
capabilities for interplanetary flight. 2022: Making Mars Habitable
While NASA spends the 2020s exploring how to best keep humans healthy in
space, SpaceX plans to start putting down the infrastructure for humans
to colonize it. SpaceX anticipates completing its first 54.6-million-km
(33.9-million-mile) trip to Mars in 2022. Image Credit: SpaceX In his
update earlier this year, Elon Musk revealed plans for a rocket that is
far bigger and more powerful than NASA's Space Launch System and even
his agency's own Falcon Heavy --- the BFR. A rocket that big would have
enough space for fuel to take humans to Mars, or even allow for
Earth-based city-to-city travel. With a maximum payload of 150 tons, the
enormous 106-meter (347.7-feet) rocket would break the current record
for biggest payload (including cargo, fuel, and passengers) launched
into orbit, while providing the lowest cost for each additional launch.
To reach the Moon, the BFR would launch from the Earth's surface,
transfer propellant from fuel depots previously stationed in Earth's
orbit, accelerate in orbit, pick up an injection of fuel for the
remaining distance to the lunar surface on the way, and land. SpaceX
plans to refuel the rocket once it is in orbit in order to extend its
range and payload capacity so that it can return safely to Earth. Tests
have already shown that it's possible to refuel rockets in space. NASA
conducted the Robotic Refueling Mission in 2011, and it successfully
completed a robot-actuated propellant transfer on an exposed platform of
the International Space Station. Image Credit: SpaceX By 2022, SpaceX
expects to land at least two cargo ships on Mars in order to establish a
habitat for humans. The primary goal of those initial missions is to
find a reliable source of water on the Martian surface. 2024: Manned
Missions On The BFR Image Credit: SpaceX Two years after those cargo
ships establish an infrastructure, SpaceX plans to send humans to
inhabit a colony on Mars. The passengers aboard the BFR's 40-cabin Mars
transit module will be the first to make the unprecedented trip. This
is, Musk would probably admit, an aggressive timeline. And it may not
work in SpaceX's favor: Due to planetary alignments and other factors
such as solar power requirements and fuel limitations, the launch window
of Earth-Mars travel is only a few weeks, according to Wired. And that's
assuming that all the other pieces fall perfectly into place --- neither
the BFR nor its predecessor, the Falcon Heavy, has yet had a successful
launch. Should the BFR mission make it to Mars, it will contain the
materials to construct a propellant production plant as part of its
Martian colony. The plan would suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and turn it into deep-cryo CO4 fuel using solar power. 2025-2030: A Year
In Space Image Credit: NASA SpaceX might be ready to send humans to live
in space by the early 2020s, but NASA is a little more cautious. The
government space agency is planning to put astronauts into orbit for a
year to find out if humans are indeed ready to live on a different
planet. In March 2016, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly completed a similar
year-long mission aboard the ISS to test the effects of zero gravity on
the human body and what that will mean for future space travel to Mars.
Unlike Kelly's mission, however, NASA's 2021 mission will put astronauts
in orbit around the Moon. [They'll be in a "deep-space gateway"
---]{.underline} a small ISS-like station that will serve as a testing
ground for future deep space missions, including later missions to Mars.
It [will be built over five earlier mission]{.underline}s, four of them
with humans aboard. The effects of spending a year in lunar orbit on the
human body, caused by factors such as different day-night cycles and
solar radiation, are still unknown. [2030s:]{.underline} NASA Sends
Humans To Mars Five years after SpaceX's manned missions to Mars, NASA
plans to send its own spacecraft to the Red Planet. Using data and
samples from the Curiosity and Mars 2020 rovers, [[NASA will]{.mark}
first [establish how humans could sustain themselves on the Martian
surface before sending manned spacecraft]{.mark} from its deep-space
gateway to do so.]{.underline}

#### Security cooperation [fails]{.underline}\-\--all our commitments are [uncredible]{.underline}.

R. Clarke **Cooper, 21** (R. Clarke Cooper, Nonresident Senior Fellow,
Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs,
Former U.S. Alternate Representative to the United Nations Security
Council, 9-3-2021, accessed on 7-18-2022, Atlantic Council, "American
security cooperation needs an 'integrity check'",

HBisevac)

Yet [successful security cooperation]{.underline}---which includes arms
transfers, training, security assistance, treaties, or agreements---is
[built around two key principles]{.underline}: [**trust** and
**integrity** of **commitment**]{.underline}, [both of which are **at
risk** today]{.underline} thanks to the haphazard US withdrawal from
Afghanistan.

In the US military, the term "[integrity check]{.underline}" [refers to
a concern about]{.underline} an individual's or unit's [**capability**
or **trustworthiness**]{.underline}. Following the debacle in Kabul,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} its
[global security cooperation posture is **in dire need of
one**]{.underline}.

Just look at the anger expressed by stalwart NATO allies such as the
United Kingdom, which in the aftermath of 9/11 unquestionably joined in
to invoke the Washington Treaty's Article 5 for collective self-defense
(the first time the Alliance ever did so). That NATO launched its first
operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area and began a far-reaching
transformation of capabilities signaled its trust in the United States'
reliability when it came to security cooperation.

Now, treaty allies and partner nations are reassessing their bilateral
security relationships with the United States. It's not just the NATO
states caught off-guard by the haphazard departure from Afghanistan that
will think twice before embarking upon future military campaigns with
the United States. Resolute defense partners in the Middle East and the
Indo-Pacific---including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan---likely also need overt reassurance, such as a clear
national-security strategy and declared recommitments.

Additionally, these [partners]{.underline} are [**increasingly feeling**
the need to proactively **raise** their **own** defense
capabilities]{.underline} by boosting their budgets or coordinating with
allies [to ensure regional security]{.underline} along with the United
States.

[Besides **stress-testing**]{.underline} the [**integrity** of American
security cooperation]{.underline}, the Afghanistan
[withdrawal]{.underline} also [highlights]{.underline} the [necessity of
**staying the course** on **long-term investment** in **mutually
beneficial** security partnerships with countries]{.underline} with
which the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has **shared
interests**]{.underline}---or shared threats. [Well before]{.underline}
the fall of [Afghanistan]{.underline}, [foreign partners]{.underline}
were [already **questioning** the **reliability** of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [at a time
when]{.underline} the [debate in Washington]{.underline} [about our
**global posture**]{.underline} was [becoming **increasingly
politicized**]{.underline}.

The case for partnering with the United States needs to be clearly
articulated through the presence, performance, and processes of American
security cooperation. The quality of US aerospace and defense equipment,
the commitment to build capabilities, and the reassurance that comes
from partnering with the US military must include further transparency,
accountability, and predictability of policies.

If not, American allies and partners will be hesitant to collaborate
with us on future shared security requirements---or simply seek
cooperation elsewhere.

We owe it to our fellow Americans, as well as to allies and partners, to
be candid about the costs of security and what it takes to support our
shared values of the rule of law, civil society, and human rights. As we
await the outcome of the Global Posture Review, or a revised
Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, anti-democratic adversaries in
Beijing and Moscow are aggressively exploiting each disruption
associated with the Taliban takeover in Kabul.

If alliances are indeed our "greatest asset"---whether in the Middle
East, Indo-Pacific, Africa, or Europe---it is crucial for US officials
to actively affirm their values through clear recommitments and presence
in security cooperation, such as the recent pledges made to Israeli
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.

We [would be **naïve** to believe that countries]{.underline} around the
world [have **no choice** but to **partner** with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Washington must be
deliberate in its efforts to prove why choosing the United States as a
security partner remains the best option.

### 2NC -- No Scol 

#### Space col is too expensive -- costs trillions.

Question: How do you build it? Discussion: Good question! Wave a magic
wand! In all seriousness, there are two possible approaches. Send a
nuclear powered robot to the asteroid belt, find an appropriate sized
carbonaceous chondrite asteroid. We're talking \~300 m long. Have it
mine water and blast it out to move its orbit to the Earth, inserting it
in geostationary orbit. Construct a cable by extrusion, probably
pointing away from the earth. When it's finished, rotate it into place
above a suitable point on the Earth. Profit. Problems include possibly
crashing said asteroid into Australia, and a slow rate of construction.
Even if it built a cable at 1 km/day, it would still take 100 years to
reach the required length. [[Launch a seed cable]{.mark} to
geostationary orbit.]{.underline} Currently the largest rocket available
can launch 6 tonnes to geostationary orbit. This is more than enough for
a clever communications satellite, so we'll have to make do. The
satellite consists of a spool and other gizmos, and the cable can be
paid out at the appropriate angle to compensate for Coriolis forces
rather rapidly. The [cable in question would be about a quarter of a mm
thick, but capable of supporting a large car, in addition to its own
considerable weight]{.underline}. Part of that extra mass could consist
of attitude control rockets at the LEO altitude to help it avoid space
junk, and possible laser systems for micrometeorites. Once the feeder
cable was secured, additional strands could climb and fix themselves
into place at an exponential rate. [Finally, [shielding, tracks,
dampers]{.mark}, giant [space lasers]{.mark} and other equipment could
be fixed in place and the cable **[completed in as little as 5
years]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Note that construction on a tail or
counterweight could proceed at the same time. As multiple strands could
be build on the earth at the same time, there is no bottleneck in this
approach. Disadvantages include the cost of the initial launch, weight
balance issues, and the vulnerability of the early cable to severing.
Question: What about vibrational modes? Discussion: The math of this is
left as an exercise for the reader. The sound velocity is given by the
square root of the tension divided by the linear mass density, just like
a guitar string. The sound velocity goes to zero near the ground,
implying that the wavelength also goes to zero, and the amplitude
necessarily increases. Fortunately the atmosphere provides some viscous
dissipation, but ultimately avoiding harmful vibrations is a matter of
clever design. Some transverse vibrations are probably an excellent way
to transmit power along the cable and to enable it to avoid collisions
with satellites at lower orbits. Question: What might other
[[hazards]{.underline}]{.mark} be? Discussion: Corrosion,
micrometeorites, lightning, attacks, etc. Most of these issues [[can be
dealt with]{.mark} by covering the structure in a shield like the shield
on the ISS]{.underline}. It consists of a ceramic layer which absorbs
the impact by shattering, and a metallic shield layer which can absorb
lots of small impacts. There are other valid approaches for absorbing
smaller collisions as well. The tracks would also be covered, possibly
by moveable hatches that open as the climber passes and close after it
leaves. Tracks would be multiply redundant and would be able to be
switched in case of damage or maintenance such that the overall system
could continue to operate without breaks. Although the cable could be as
narrow as 15 cm, it makes more sense to separate the strands in a
weight-sharing structure to which the tracks and other stuff can be
attached. That way the breakage of compromise of any particular strand
is less likely to affect those around it. Question: What would it look
like? Discussion: Not much. At any point along its length, perspective
would disappear it out of sight within a few km. On the earth's surface,
it would appear as a rope going up and disappear from sight before
reaching the clouds. From the top looking down the earth would be the
size of a basketball at arms' length. On the way down, the earth would
appear to dominate the view with a horizon for the whole day, but only
in the last half hour would you enter the atmosphere. For comparison, it
has similar length-width ratio with a railway rail that stretches across
a continent. Question: [So how much does it cost?]{.underline}
Discussion: This is impossible to estimate! The cost of a launch to
geostationary orbit is about \$150m, but this would be a trivial expense
compared to the materials. If [[each climber]{.underline}]{.mark} cost
the same as an A320, then they [[would cost \$100b]{.underline}]{.mark},
including a few spares. If the cable cost the same as steel, the
[materials would cost \$300b.]{.underline} Cable would likely be made
from coal or oil, or possibly atmospheric CO2. What you lose in material
construction costs you might make back because of the lack of refinement
needed. At a billion tonnes, the cable represents about 10% of the
current annual carbon output, so could be viewed as positive carbon
sequestration! [[**Including development costs and
peripherals**,]{.mark} a [cost in the **trillion dollar** range seems
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### OR that'll collapse the global economy.

happen if the US was a quadrillion dollars in debt?"
https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-the-US-was-a-quadrillion-dollars-in-debt}//JM

Most likely[, [if our economy is]{.mark} ever [**quadrillion Dollars**
in debt]{.mark}]{.underline}, than [**[nobody would lend us any
money]{.mark}**, because we would never be able to pay it
back]{.underline}, and if we did pay it back, [[the dollar]{.mark} we
payed it back with **[won\'t be worth anything]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
If nobody wanted to lend us any money, how would we mathematically pay
for all our expenses? Our expenses clearly exeed our tax revenues, and
therefore we would have to either come up with the money by raising
taxes, or cut spending. But, we all know how that goes...the political
politicians never want to cut spending, and if they raise taxes that
high they won\'t get re-elected, and there will be crazy riots, and
basically a full on rebellion, they come up with a genius
idea---inlfation. [If this situation ever becomes a
reality]{.underline}, which it probably will eventually, [there will be
a dollar crisis, and the dollar would collapse, **[the world economy
would collapse]{.mark}**, and for a few years there will be a situation
like there is in Venezuela, except worldwide]{.underline}, and then
finally people will do what they have done for thousands of years---go
back to gold and silver!

### 2NC -- T/Tradeoff

[Multiple high-level reviews of American [SC]{.mark}

commanders (GCC) coordinate with the CJCS and chiefs of mission around

[necessary]{.mark} to address the manner in which [the DoD currently
measures the value]{.mark} of partners? The simple answer is
**[money]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With budgets decreasing, [the United

#### It requires resources.

For context, the aforementioned security cooperation challenges
mentioned by Maj Croshier, and found throughout many parts of the world,
tend to follow a similar pattern.  A partner nation is experiencing
internal security challenges that preclude it from achieving a desired
security objective.  The security objective is of interest to both the
partner nation and the United States.  In view of this,
[the]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) [conducts
security cooperation activities with the partner nation in the form of
visits, conferences, equipping, or some other type of aid,]{.underline}
to help them address the security shortfall.  According to JP-3
"[[SC]{.underline}]{.mark} \[security cooperation\]
**[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a [commitment of
USG]{.mark}]{.underline} \[United States Government\] [**[resources and
funds]{.underline}** [to execute]{.underline}]{.mark} [security
cooperation [activities that benefit PNs]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Partner
Nations\] [[and the US]{.underline}]{.mark} \[United States\] [in their
achievement of mutual foreign and defense policy
objectives]{.underline}."\[ii\]  This is the main intent of security
cooperation and it is a fairly straightforward concept.  Regrettably, it
is in the application of this upfront mandate that we stumble across our
global challenge.

#### Must be substantive -- can't just be talks.
