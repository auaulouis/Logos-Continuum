\[TITLE CAPTION\]: [[Choosing to **ignore**]{.mark} the [side of the
argument you don\'t agree with **only weakens** your
own]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It Can Strengthen Your Argument

Or it may [[lead you to modify]{.mark}ing [your
argument]{.mark}]{.underline} some, either
[[because]{.underline}]{.mark} you\'ve realized [[you weren\'t
expressing something **clearly**]{.mark} **enough**]{.underline},
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} you weren\'t [[aware of all the
facts]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[danger of reading]{.mark} **extremely
[biased]{.mark}** [articles]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} listening to a biased speaker,
[is]{.underline} the chance of [[being fed
misinformation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unfortunately, not everyone is
honorable enough to not use whatever mischievous tactic they can to get
others to follow them.

Furthermore, [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} this did happen and [[you]{.mark}
went on to [cite]{.mark}]{.underline} their [**[misinformation]{.mark}**
to support your own]{.underline} argument, [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
would [[lessen your credibility as well as
**reassert**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[unreliability]{.mark} of
theirs]{.underline}. [This is [only if]{.mark} the source [isn\'t trying
to address both sides]{.mark} themselves]{.underline}. They, as well as
**[[you, don\'t need to agree with both sides or remain objective
in]{.mark} their [stance on the matter]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[but
cherry-picking things that only]{.underline}]{.mark} work to
[[strengthen your side of the argument]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[**actually [hurt]{.mark}** [it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, [[if you]{.mark} read rebuttals]{.underline}, [or [listen
to]{.mark} people who have]{.underline} just as much stock in their
[[oppositional argument]{.underline}]{.mark} that you have in yours,
[[you]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[gain]{.mark} **new
[perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[You]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[see where]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[opposition is]{.mark} coming
[from and modify it to strengthen **your own
argument**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a way that can better address your
points.

[Once you take]{.underline} the [time to assess]{.underline} the [points
of people who think differently]{.underline} than you, [[if]{.mark} you
decide]{.underline} afterwards that [[you\'re still satisfied with your
argument]{.underline}]{.mark} as it is, the [[information is **still
useful**]{.underline}]{.mark}. An [[instance]{.underline}]{.mark} could
occur [[where someone]{.underline}]{.mark} tries to [[**criticize** you
for not knowing what you\'re talking about]{.underline}]{.mark}, and if
they do, then [[you\'ll be able to say]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[you]{.mark} have **actually [read]{.mark}** up]{.underline} on [[both
sides of the argument]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or other resources, and
therefore do know what you\'re talking about. Depending on the person,
they may not care much, but forcing yourself to still pay attention to
that information does matter.

### Enclave Deliberation Bad

#### Studies demonstrate [casual]{.underline} evidence between the AFF's model and violence. If anything, these studies understate the effect.

Steffen Selmer **Andersen 7-7**-2022. Researcher at the Department of
Political Science, focusing on radicalization, terrorism, causes for
political violence, legitimacy, misogyny and public policy. \"Accepting
Violence? A Laboratory Experiment of the Violent Consequences of
Deliberation in Politically Aggrieved Enclaves\". Terrorism and
Political Violence. DOI: 10.1080/09546553.2022.2076600. DL

In the introduction, I raised the question whether enclave deliberation
might break down barriers that typically prevent politically aggrieved
people from accepting the use of violence as a means to meet their ends.
Unfortunately, this study indicates that we can answer this primary
question in a confirmatory way. [**[Enclave deliberation]{.mark}** among
aggrieved citizens seems to [**enhance** the **acceptance of
violence**]{.mark} in general and as a specific response to aggrieving
policies.]{.underline} Additionally, [I reproduced the finding that
enclave deliberation **causally enhances** existing political attitudes
and decreases enclave members' diversity in opinions. [This]{.mark}
result [was **strengthened** with a **DD-analysis** aimed at
investigating]{.mark} the [causality]{.mark} of this
argument.]{.underline}

Before discussing the implications of this study, [I address a few
important questions]{.underline} regarding generalizability and
ecological validity. Most experimental studies, especially conducted in
the laboratory, are met with two questions: (1) What can we infer from
an experiment where participants were mostly students when the study
population is relatively different, and (2) [can we trust the results
outside the laboratory?]{.underline}

Addressing the latter question first, [I acknowledge]{.underline} that
only [few experiments]{.underline}, this included, succeed in
[grasp]{.underline}ing [the complexity of real-world
situations]{.underline}. **[However]{.underline}**, less might also be
sufficient, and I argue that [[the]{.mark} **['artificiality']{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [this]{.mark} particular laboratory [experiment
should]{.mark} **[strengthen]{.mark} our belief** in [the
results]{.mark} rather than weaken it.]{.underline} First, in real life,
politically aggrieved citizens tend to segregate into enclaves because
of their similarities in, for example, opinions, whereas participants in
this study had to undergo a two-stage priming method to simulate such a
scenario. Others [studies]{.underline}72 [indicate]{.underline} that the
group [polarization]{.underline} effect [is]{.underline} **[even
stronger]{.underline}** [when participants know they are grouped with
**like-minded** strangers. Here, participants did not have
this]{.underline} information. Second, [enclave members tend to already
have **close affectionate** bonds]{.underline} or form them through
joint activities such as group discussions,73 [where participants were
**grouped with strangers**.]{.underline} Lastly, [outside the
laboratory, politically aggrieved [enclaves do not]{.mark} only
[deliberate once]{.mark}]{.underline}.74 **[Rather]{.underline}**,
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[meet up **numerous
times**]{.underline}]{.mark} (offline and online) [[before]{.mark}
"[taking action]{.mark}"]{.underline}---[[exemplified in the
**storming** of the]{.mark} **U.S. [Capitol]{.mark}**.]{.underline}75
Therefore, [if this study was to simulate "real-world"
deliberation]{.underline} in aggrieved enclaves, participants should
have had strongly felt political grievances, relatively strong
affectional ties with other participants, and partaken in several
enclave discussions before measuring their acceptance of violence. Had
it been practically and ethically feasible to "intensify" these
circumstances, [we would]{.underline}, however, from a theoretical
perspective, only [expect]{.underline} [participants' acceptance of
violence to **increase rather than decrease**]{.underline}. As such,
[the causal evidence]{.underline} provided by this study [should not be
seen in light of but **despite of**]{.underline} [the way [the
experiment was]{.mark} designed.]{.underline}

Returning to the related question concerning generalizability, it is
twofold: (1) [What do we learn about politically aggrieved enclaves from
a laboratory experiment [conducted on]{.mark} a
**[student]{.mark}-heavy** sample, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} (2) what
knowledge do we gain from a study of only
"[[lefties]{.underline}]{.mark}?" First, [the fact that most
participants were students should **not** bode **concern**]{.underline}.
Recall that [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} particular [student [sample
consisted of]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly **[highly
[educated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[people]{.mark} exclusively from a
well-established democracy where violence is luckily **still
seldom**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[they indicated]{.mark} high
**institutional trust**, **[agreeableness]{.mark}**, and **imagination**
[and low]{.mark} self-uncertainty and [neuroticism]{.mark}.
These]{.underline} are all characteristics which [typically]{.underline}
[**do not correspond** with the acceptance of violence.]{.underline}76
Therefore, [the utilized sample should be seen as a least-likely
case]{.underline} based on our prior knowledge [of what
predicts]{.underline} the acceptance of [violence. [In this light, the
results are **conservative estimates**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} this relation in
"[[real-world]{.underline}]{.mark}" [politically aggrieved
[enclaves]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, [what can we learn from only studying left-leaning]{.underline}
[participants]{.underline} on two policy areas? Obviously, this is a key
limitation of this study as I cannot report empirical evidence
suggesting that enclave deliberation increases the acceptance of
violence among politically aggrieved right-leaning enclaves. However,
the [group [polarization]{.mark} effect has been documented both among
Republicans and Democrats]{.underline} on various policy areas,77 and
numerous studies reveal that mechanisms such as group fusion do not
discriminate between jihadist,78 right-wing79 or left-wing ideologies.80
Consequently, I expect that [these mechanisms]{.underline} might [[kick
in **regardless** of]{.mark} **political [ideology]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} political [topics and increase]{.mark} the acceptance of
[violence **across the board**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still, it is an
interesting gap in our knowledge that calls for further investigation.

Another way forward is by testing the importance of and potential
interplay between the suggested theoretical mechanisms that link enclave
deliberation with the acceptance of violence. From the radicalization
literature, the mere amplification of existing political grievances in
itself is argued to lead to a discussion of "what to do about it" where
violence for some could be a viable solution. Within social identity
theory, mechanisms such as specific identity types and the strength of
them are suggested to be at play. However, the jury is still out in
terms of determining which of these mechanisms matter the most. Do they
interplay, and if so, how? Perhaps a third strain of literature might
provide a new set of applicable mechanisms? Future studies aiming at
shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the relationship between
enclave deliberation and the acceptance of violence should be welcomed.

[[This study]{.underline}]{.mark} has several implications. First, it
[[provides **empirical backing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the hypothesis
claiming that enclave deliberation increases]{.underline} the acceptance
of [violence]{.underline}, which is often implied but seldom tested
directly in radicalization research. Until now, we have primarily seen
case studies address this potential causal relationship and this study
was designed to contribute and supplement these studies with tight
experimental control of an independent variable receiving increased
public and academic interest. Second, these results provided another
test of the group polarization mechanism specifically in a political
context similar to the study by Schkade et al.81 As shown, [the
hypothesis gained **strong support** even after conducting a **DD
analysis** that more directly **tests the causality** of the
thesis.]{.underline} Thereby, we have further evidence from outside the
US indicating that when like-minded individuals deliberate, they, on
average, tend to have amplified political attitudes relative to before
deliberating. Third, these results imply that [enclave deliberation not
only amplifies existing political attitudes but]{.underline} also has
the potential to [increase]{.underline} enclave members' acceptance of
[violence]{.underline}. Lastly, although the aim was to test the
theoretical arguments in a face-to-face setting, the results might
travel to parts of the online sphere. In this experiment, participants
were filtered into likeminded groups and feed information intended to
conflict with their opinion. This dynamic resembles to some degree how
social media algorithms function, as users a filtered based on their own
preferences and those of their network. However, this point would need
further empirical investigation.

The results presented in this article suggest that [there is a **causal
link** between enclave deliberation and the acceptance of
violence.]{.underline} Now, we need to investigate further why they are
causally linked. Lastly, this article might provide practitioners
working with preventive work and policymakers with a clearer idea of
when and how to intervene in politically aggrieved enclaves.
Specifically, [[by **de-segregating**]{.mark} politically aggrieved
[enclaves]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} might
[[avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} them [enhancing]{.underline} their
acceptance of [[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. A measure such as
**[active [moderation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[might be
effective]{.underline}]{.mark} in this regard, especially online.
However, it is a difficult path to tread as potential interventionists
have to balance considerations of public security with citizens' civil
liberties.

### AT: Surrender to Blackness

#### Deference epistemologies are [worse]{.underline} for community formation, [reify]{.underline} trauma, and actively [strengthen]{.underline} hegemonic structures by marginalizing the people who [were never here to defer to in the first place]{.underline}.

**Táíwò, 20**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, "Being-in-the-Room Privilege: Elite Capture and
Epistemic Deference," The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4, dml)

I think it's less about the core ideas and more about the prevailing
norms that convert them into practice. The call to "listen to the most
affected" or "centre the most marginalized" is ubiquitous in many
academic and activist circles. But it's never sat well with me. In my
experience, [[when people say]{.mark} they need to ["**listen to the
most affected**", it]{.mark} isn't because they intend to set up **Skype
calls to refugee camps** or to **collaborate with houseless
people**]{.underline}. Instead, [it has more [often meant]{.mark}
handing **[conversational authority]{.mark}** and **attentional goods**
to those who **most snugly fit** into the social categories associated
with these ills -- **regardless** of what they actually **do** o0r **do
not know**, or what they **have** or **have not personally
experienced**]{.underline}. In the case of my conversation with Helen,
my racial category tied me more "authentically" to an experience that
neither of us had had. She was called to defer to me by the rules of the
game as we understood it. Even where stakes are high -- where potential
researchers are discussing how to understand a social phenomenon, where
activists are deciding what to target -- these rules often prevail. The
trap wasn't that standpoint epistemology was affecting the conversation,
but how. Broadly, [the norms]{.underline} of putting standpoint
epistemology into practice [[call for]{.mark} practices of
**[deference]{.mark}**: **giving offerings**, **passing the mic**,
**believing**]{.underline}. These are good ideas in many cases, and the
norms that ask us to be ready to do them stem from admirable
motivations: a desire to increase the social power of marginalized
people identified as sources of knowledge and rightful targets of
deferential behaviour. But [deferring in this way [as a]{.mark} **rule**
or [**default political orientation**]{.mark} can actually work
**[counter]{.mark}** to [marginalized groups' interests,]{.mark}
especially [in **elite spaces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Some rooms have
**outsize**]{.mark} **power** and **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
the Situation Room, the newsroom, the bargaining table, the conference
room. [[Being in these rooms means being in a position to **affect
institutions**]{.mark} and **broader social dynamics** by way of
deciding what one is to say and do. [Access]{.mark} to these rooms [is
itself a]{.mark} kind of **[social advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
one often gained through some prior social advantage. From a societal
standpoint, [the "**most affected**" by]{.underline} the [social
injustices]{.underline} we associate with politically important
identities like gender, class, race, and nationality [are
**disproportionately likely** to be]{.underline} incarcerated,
underemployed, or part of the 44 percent of the world's population
without internet access -- and thus [both **left out** of the rooms of
power and **largely ignored** by the people in the rooms of
power]{.underline}. [[Individuals]{.mark} who make it past]{.underline}
the various **[social selection pressures]{.underline}** that filter out
those social identities associated with these negative outcomes are most
likely to be in the room. That is, [they [are most likely to be in
the]{.mark} [room]{.mark} precisely [because of ways]{.mark} in which
[they are]{.mark} [**systematically different** from]{.mark} (and thus
potentially **unrepresentative** of) [the]{.mark} very [people
they]{.mark} are then **asked to [represent]{.mark}** in the
room]{.underline}. I suspected that Helen's offer was a trap. She was
not the one who set it, but it threatened to ensnare us both all the
same. Broader cultural norms -- the sort set in motion by prefacing
statements with "As a Black man..." -- cued up a set of
standpoint-respecting practices that many of us know consciously or
unconsciously by rote. However, [the forms of
[deference]{.mark}]{.underline} that often follow [are ultimately
**self-undermining** and only reliably [serve "**elite
capture**]{.mark}": the control over **political agendas** and
**resources** by a group's **most advantaged** people. If we want
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} use standpoint epistemology to
[**[challenge]{.mark}** [unjust]{.mark} power [arrangements, it's **hard
to imagine** how we could do **worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To say
what's wrong with the popular, deferential applications of standpoint
epistemology, we need to understand what makes it popular. A number of
cynical answers present themselves: some (especially the more socially
advantaged) don't genuinely want social change -- they just want the
appearance of it. Alternatively, deference to figures from oppressed
communities is a performance that sanitizes, apologizes for, or simply
distracts from the fact that the deferrer has enough "in the room"
privilege for their "lifting up" of a perspective to be of consequence.
I suspect there is some truth to these views, but I am unsatisfied. Many
of the people who support and enact these deferential norms are rather
like Helen: motivated by the right reasons, but trusting people they
share such rooms with to help them find the proper practical expression
of their joint moral commitments. We don't need to attribute bad faith
to all or even most of those who interpret standpoint epistemology
deferentially to explain the phenomenon, and it's not even clear it
would help. Bad "roommates" aren't the problem for the same reason that
Helen being a good roommate wasn't the solution: the problem emerges
from how the rooms themselves are constructed and managed. To return to
the initial example with Helen, the issue wasn't merely that I hadn't
grown up in the kind of low-income, redlined community she was
imagining. The epistemic situation was much worse than this. Many of the
facts about me that made my life chances different from those of the
people she was imagining were the very same facts that made me likely to
be offered things on their behalf. If I had grown up in such a
community, we probably wouldn't have been on the phone together. Many
aspects of our social system serve as filtering mechanisms, determining
which interactions happen and between whom, and thus which social
patterns people are in a position to observe. For the majority of the
20th century, the U.S. quota system of immigration made legal
immigration with a path to citizenship almost exclusively available to
Europeans (earning Hitler's regard as the obvious "leader in developing
explicitly racist policies of nationality and immigration"). But the
1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration
possibilities, with a preference for "skilled labour". My parents'
qualification as skilled labourers does much to explain their entry into
the country and the subsequent class advantages and monetary resources
(such as wealth) that I was born into. We are not atypical: the
Nigerian-American population is one of the country's most successful
immigrant populations (what no one mentions, of course, is that the
112,000 or so Nigerian-Americans with advanced degrees is utterly
dwarfed by the 82 million Nigerians who live on less than a dollar a
day, or how the former fact intersects with the latter). The selectivity
of immigration law helps explain the rates of educational attainment of
the Nigerian diasporic community that raised me, which in turn helps
explain my entry into the exclusive Advanced Placement and Honours
classes in high school, which in turn helps explain my access to higher
education\...and so on, and so on. It is easy, then, to see how [this
deferential form]{.underline} of standpoint epistemology [contributes to
elite capture at **scale**. The rooms of power and influence are at the
end of causal chains that have **selection effects**. [As you
get]{.mark} higher and [higher]{.mark} forms of [education]{.mark},
[social experiences **narrow**]{.mark} -- [some students are pipelined
to **PhDs** and others to **prisons**]{.mark}. Deferential ways of
dealing with identity can **inherit** the distortions caused by these
selection processes]{.underline}. ​[But it's equally easy to see
locally]{.underline} -- in this room, in this academic literature or
field, in this conversation -- why [this deference]{.underline} seems to
make sense. It is often an improvement on the epistemic procedure that
preceded it: the person deferred to may well be better epistemically
positioned than the others in the room. It [may well be the **best we
can do** while holding **fixed** most of the facts about the rooms
themselves: what power resides in them, who is admitted]{.underline}.
[But these are the **last** facts we should want to hold
fixed]{.underline}. Doing better than the epistemic norms we've
inherited from a history of explicit global apartheid is an awfully low
bar to set. [The facts that explain who ends up in which room shape our
world **much more powerfully** than the squabbles for **comparative
prestige** between people who have already made it into the rooms. And
when the conversation is about social justice, the mechanisms of the
social system that determine who gets into which room often just are the
parts of society we aim to address]{.underline}. For example, the fact
that incarcerated people cannot participate in academic discussions
about freedom that physically take place on campus is intimately related
to the fact that they are locked in cages. [Deference epistemology marks
itself as a **solution** to an epistemic and political problem. But not
only does it **fail** to solve these problems, it **adds new
ones**]{.underline}. One might think [questions of justice ought to be
primarily concerned with fixing disparities around **health care**,
**working conditions**, and **basic material** and **interpersonal
security**. Yet conversations]{.underline} about justice [have come to
be shaped by people who have **ever more specific practical advice**
about fixing the **distribution of attention** and **conversational
power**. [Deference]{.mark} practices that serve **attention-focused
[campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. we've read too many white men,
let's now read some people of colour) [can **fail** on their own
**highly questionable** terms: attention to **spokespeople** from
marginalized groups could]{.underline}, for example, [**[direct
attention]{.mark} [away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the need to change
[the]{.mark} **social [system]{.mark}** []{.mark}that marginalizes them.
Elites from marginalized groups can **benefit** from this arrangement in
ways that are **compatible** with social progress. But treating group
elites' interests as **necessarily** or even **presumptively aligned**
with full group interests involves a **political naiveté** we cannot
afford. Such treatment of elite interests functions as a **racial
Reaganomics**: a strategy reliant on **fantasies** about the exchange
rate between the attention economy and the material
economy]{.underline}. [[Perhaps the lucky few]{.mark} who get jobs
finding the **most culturally authentic** and **cosmetically radical
description** of the continuing carnage [are]{.mark} really **[winning
one for the culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Then[, after we]{.mark} in
the chattering class get the **clout we deserve** and [**secure the
bag**, it]{.mark}s contents [will eventually **trickle down** to]{.mark}
the [workers who **clean up after our conferences**]{.mark}, to **slums
of the Global South's megacities**, to its **countryside**. **[But
probably not]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A fuller and fairer assessment of
what is going on with deference and standpoint epistemology would go
beyond technical argument, and contend with the emotional appeals of
this strategy of deference. Those in powerful rooms may be "elites"
relative to the larger group they represent, but this guarantees nothing
about how they are treated in the rooms they are in. After all, a person
privileged in an absolute sense (a person belonging to, say, the half of
the world that has secure access to "basic needs") may nevertheless feel
themselves to be consistently on the low end of the power dynamics they
actually experience. [Deference epistemology]{.underline} responds to
real, morally weighty experiences of being put down, ignored, sidelined,
or silenced. It thus [has an important non-epistemic appeal to members
of]{.underline} stigmatized [or marginalized groups: it **intervenes
directly** in morally consequential practices of giving attention and
respect]{.underline}. The social dynamics we experience have an outsize
role in developing and refining our political subjectivity, and our
sense of ourselves. But [this]{.underline} very [strength]{.underline}
of standpoint epistemology -- [its recognition of the importance of
perspective -- becomes its **weakness** when combined with **deferential
practical norms**. Emphasis on the ways we are marginalized often
matches the world as we have experienced it. But, from a structural
perspective, the rooms we **never needed to enter** (and the
explanations of why we can **avoid** these rooms) might have **more to
teach us** about the world and our place in it. If so, the deferential
approach to standpoint epistemology actually **prevents** "**centring**"
or even **hearing** from the most marginalized; it **focuses** us on the
interaction of the rooms we **occupy**, rather than calling us to
account for the interactions we **don't experience**]{.underline}. This
fact about who is in the room, combined with the fact that speaking for
others generates its own set of important problems (particularly when
they are not there to advocate for themselves), eliminates pressures
that might otherwise trouble the centrality of our own suffering -- and
of the suffering of the marginalized people that do happen to make it
into rooms with us. [The dangers with this feature of deference politics
are **grave**, as are the risks for those outside of the most powerful
rooms. For those who are **deferred to**, it can supercharge
**group-undermining norms**]{.underline}. In Conflict is Not Abuse,
Sarah Schulman makes a provocative observation about the psychological
effects of [both trauma and felt superiority]{.underline}: [while
these]{.underline} often [come about for different reasons]{.underline}
and have very different moral statuses, [they result in similar
behavioural patterns. Chief among these are [**misrepresenting**
the]{.mark} stakes of [conflict]{.mark} (often by **overstating harm**)
or representing others' independence as a **hostile threat** ([such as
failures to "**centre**" the **right topics**]{.mark} or **people**).
These behaviours, whatever their causal history, [have **corrosive
effects**]{.mark} on individuals who perform them as well as the groups
around them, **[especially when]{.mark} a [community]{.mark}'s [norms
magnify]{.mark}** or **multiply** [these behaviours]{.mark} rather than
**constraining** or **metabolizing** them]{.underline}. [For those who
**defer**, the habit can supercharge **moral cowardice**. The norms
provide social cover for the **abdication of responsibility**: it
displaces onto **individual heroes**]{.underline}, a hero class, or a
mythicized past [the work that is **ours** to do **now** in the present.
Their perspective may be clearer on **this** or **that specific
matter**, but their **overall** point of view isn't **any less
particular** or **constrained** by history than ours]{.underline}. More
importantly, [deference places the accountability that is **all of
ours** to bear onto **select people** -- and, more often than not, a
**hyper-sanitized** and **thoroughly fictional caricature** of
them]{.underline}. The same [tactics of deference]{.underline} that
insulate us from criticism also [**insulate** us from **connection** and
**transformation**. They **prevent** us from engaging **empathetically**
and **authentically** with the struggles of other people]{.underline} --
prerequisites of coalitional politics. [As identities become **more**
and **more fine-grained** and **disagreements sharper**, we come to
realize that "**coalitional politics**"]{.underline} (understood as
**[struggle across difference]{.underline}**) [is, simply, **politics**.
Thus, the deferential orientation, like that **fragmentation** of
political collectivity it enables, is ultimately
**anti-political**]{.underline}. [[Deference]{.mark} rather than
interdependence [may **soothe short-term psychological wounds**]{.mark}.
[But]{.mark} it does so [at a **steep cost**]{.mark}: [it can
**undermine**]{.mark} the [epistemic goals that **motivate**]{.mark} the
project, and it entrenches a politics **unbefitting** of anyone
[fighting for **freedom**]{.mark} [rather than]{.mark} for
**[privilege]{.mark}**, for **collective liberation** rather than mere
**parochial advantage**]{.underline}. How would a constructive approach
to putting standpoint epistemology into practice differ from a
deferential approach? [A constructive approach would focus on the
pursuit of **specific goals** or **end results** rather than avoiding
"**complicity**" in injustice or adhering to **moral principles**. It
would be concerned **primarily with building institutions** and
cultivating practices of **information-gathering** rather than
**helping**]{.underline}. It would focus on accountability rather than
conformity. [It would calibrate itself **directly** to the task of
**redistributing social resources** and **power** rather than to
**intermediary goals** cashed out in terms of **pedestals** or
**symbolism**]{.underline}. It would focus on building and rebuilding
rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them -- it would be a
world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual structures
of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique of the ones
we already have. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan presents a clear
example of both the possibilities and limitations of refining our
epistemic politics in this way. Michigan's Department of Environmental
Quality (MDEQ), a government body tasked with the support of "healthy
communities", with a team of fifty trained scientists at its disposal,
was complicit in covering up the scale and gravity of the public health
crisis from the beginning of the crisis in 2014 until it garnered
national attention in 2015. The MDEQ, speaking from a position of
epistemic and political authority, defended the status quo in Flint.
They claimed that "Flint water is safe to drink", and were cited in
Flint Mayor Dayne Walling's statement aiming to "dispel myths and
promote the truth about the Flint River" during the April 2014
transition to the Flint River water source. That transition was
spearheaded under the tenure of the city's emergency manager Darnell
Earley (an African-American, like many of the city residents he helped
to poison). After the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) circulated a
leaked internal memo from the federal Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) in July of 2014 expressing concern about lead in Flint water, the
MDEQ produced a doctored report that put the overall measure of lead
levels within federally mandated levels by mysteriously failing to count
two contaminated samples. The reaction from residents was immediate. The
month after the switch in water source, residents reported that their
tap water was discoloured and gave off an alarming odour. They didn't
need their oppression to be "celebrated", "centred", or narrated in the
newest academic parlance. They didn't need someone to understand what it
felt like to be poisoned. What they needed was the lead out of their
water. So they got to work. The first step was to develop epistemic
authority. To achieve this they built a new room: one that put Flint
residents and activists in active collaboration with scientists who had
the laboratories that could run the relevant tests and prove the MDEQ's
report to be fraudulent. Flint residents' outcry recruited scientists to
their cause and led a "citizen science" campaign, further raising the
alarm about the water quality and distributing sample kits to neighbours
to submit for testing. In this stage, the alliance of residents and
scientists won, and the poisoning of the children of Flint emerged as a
national scandal. But this was not enough. The second step -- cleaning
the water -- required more than state acknowledgement: it required
apportioning labour and resources to fix the water and address the
continuing health concerns. What Flint residents received, initially,
was a mix of platitudes and mockery from the ruling elite (some of this
personally committed by a President that shared a racial identity with
many of them). This year, however, it looks as though the tireless
activism of Flint residents and their expanding list of teammates has
won additional and more meaningful victories: the ongoing campaign is
pushing the replacements of the problematic service lines to their final
stage and is forcing the state of Michigan to agree to a settlement of
\$600 million for affected families. This outcome is in no way a
wholesale victory: not only will attorney fees cut a substantial portion
of payouts, but the settlement cannot undo the damage that was caused to
the residents. A constructive epistemology cannot guarantee full victory
over an oppressive system by itself. No epistemic orientation can by
itself undo the various power asymmetries between the people and the
imperial state system. But it can help make the game a little more
competitive -- and deference epistemology isn't even playing. [The
**biggest threats** to social justice attention and informational
economies are **not the absence of yet more jargon** to describe, ever
more precisely or incisively, the]{.underline} epistemic, attentional,
or interpersonal [**afflictions** of the disempowered. The biggest
threats are the **erosion** of the **practical** and **material bases**
for popular power]{.underline} over knowledge production and
distribution, particularly that [which could **aid effective political
action** and **constrain** or **eliminate predation** by elites. The
**capture** and **corruption** of these bases by well-positioned
elites]{.underline}, especially tech corporations, [goes on **unabated**
and largely **unchallenged**]{.underline}, including: the corporate
monopolization of local news, the ongoing destruction and looting of the
journalistic profession, the interference of corporations and
governments in key democratic processes, and the domination of elite
interests in the production of knowledge by research universities and
the circulation of the output of these distorted processes by
established media organizations. Confronting these threats requires
leaving some rooms -- and building new ones. [The constructive
approach]{.underline} to standpoint epistemology is demanding. It [asks
that we **swim upstream**: to be **accountable** and **responsive** to
people who **aren't yet in the room**, to build the kinds of rooms we
could **sit in together**]{.underline}, rather than merely judiciously
navigating the rooms history has built for us. But this weighty demand
is par for the course when it comes to the politics of knowledge: the
American philosopher Sandra Harding famously pointed out that standpoint
epistemology, properly understood, demands more rigour from science and
knowledge production processes generally, not less. But one important
topic stands unaddressed. [The deferential approach]{.underline} to
standpoint epistemology [often comes packaged with concern and attention
to the importance of **lived experience**]{.underline}. Among these,
[**traumatic experiences** are especially foregrounded]{.underline}. At
this juncture, scholarly analysis and argument fail me. The remainder of
what I have to say skews more towards conviction than contention. But
the life of books has taught me that conviction has just as much to
teach, however differently posed or processed, and so I press on. [I
take concerns about trauma **especially seriously**. I grew up in the
United States, a nation structured by **settler colonialism**, **racial
slavery**, and their aftermath]{.underline}, with enough collective and
historical trauma to go round. [I also grew up in a Nigerian diasporic
community, populated by many who had **genocide in living
memory**]{.underline}. At the national and community level, I have seen
a lot of traits of norms, personality, quirks of habit and action that
I've suspected were downstream of these facts. At the level of
individual experience, [I've watched and felt myself change in reaction
to fearing for my dignity or life, to crushing pain and humiliation. I
reflect on these traumatic moments **often**, and **very seldom think**:
"**That was educational**".]{.underline} These experiences can be, if we
are very fortunate, building blocks. What comes of them depends on how
the blocks are put together: what standpoint epistemologists call the
"achievement thesis". Briana Toole clarifies that, by itself, one's
social location only puts a person in a position to know. "Epistemic
privilege" or advantage is achieved only through deliberate, concerted
struggle from that position. I concede outright that this is certainly
one possible result of the experience of oppression: have no doubt that
humiliation, deprivation, and suffering can build (especially in the
context of the deliberate, structured effort of "consciousness raising",
as Toole specifically highlights). But these same experiences can also
destroy, and if I had to bet on which effect would win most often, it
would be the latter. As Agnes Callard rightly notes, trauma (and even
the righteous, well-deserved anger that often accompanies it) can
corrupt as readily as it can ennoble. Perhaps more so. Contra the old
expression, pain -- whether borne of oppression or not -- is a poor
teacher. Suffering is partial, short-sighted, and self-absorbed. We
shouldn't have a politics that expects different: oppression is not a
prep school. When it comes down to it, the thing I believe most deeply
about [[deference epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [asks
something of trauma that it **cannot give**]{.underline}. Demanding as
the constructive approach may be, [the deferential approach]{.underline}
is far more demanding and in a far more unfair way: it [asks the
traumatized to shoulder burdens **alone** that we ought to share
**collectively**]{.underline}. When I think about my trauma, I don't
think about grand lessons. I think about the quiet nobility of survival.
The very fact that those chapters weren't the final ones of my story is
powerful enough writing all on its own. It is enough to ask of those
experiences that I am still here to remember them. [Deference
epistemology asks us to be **less** than we are -- and not even for our
**own** benefit]{.underline}. As Nick Estes explains in the context of
Indigenous politics: "[The **cunning** of trauma politics is that it
turns **actual people** and **struggles**]{.underline}, whether racial
or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, [into matters of **injury**. It
[**defines an entire people**]{.mark} mostly [on their
**trauma**]{.mark} and not by their **aspirations** or **sheer
humanity**]{.underline}". [This performance is]{.underline} not for the
benefit of Indigenous people, but "[[for **white audiences**]{.mark} or
**institutions of power**]{.underline}". I also think about James
Baldwin's realization that the things that tormented him the most were
"the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive,
who had ever been alive". [That I have **survived abuse** of various
kinds, have faced **near-death** from both accidental circumstance and
violence]{.underline} (different as the particulars of these may be from
those around me) [is **[not a card to play]{.mark} in gamified social
interaction** or a **weapon to wield in [battles over
prestige]{.mark}**. It is **not** what gives me a **special right to
speak**, to **evaluate**, or to **decide for a group**. It is a
concrete, experiential manifestation of the **vulnerability** that
connects me to most of the people on this Earth. It comes between me and
other people not as a **wall**, but as a **bridge**]{.underline}.

pick up. [[Black Lives Matter has done a great job]{.underline} [in

### Ontology -- Kelley

#### Anti-Blackness isn't historically calcified 

**Kelley 17** Gary B. Nash Professor of American History at UCLA (Robin
D.G., "Robin D.G. Kelley & Fred Moten In Conversation," transcribed from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-2F9MXjRE, 1:57:36-2:02:56, dml)

KELLEY: Um, Fred---Fred will take most of these questions. So that\'s
why I\'m going to begin first because he\'s gonna, he\'s gonna---he\'s
gonna end it because he, he, he has the answer to all these questions
'cause I turn to him for these questions. On the specific, on the first
question, I just want to make sure I understand it because I\'m, you
know, I don\'t always recognize, uh, it may be because I\'m just old,
but [I don\'t always recognize]{.underline}, uh, [that black
politics]{.underline}, black \[unclear---maybe "guys"\] work politics
[have been **structured** or **defined** by white
supremacy]{.underline}. I mean, white supremacy is there. And I guess
maybe because I\'m such a student of Cedric Robinson, you know, [**not
everything is about**, or **in response to**, white
supremacy]{.underline}. And in fact, one of the critiques coming out of
doing Southern history was this idea that race relations framework, that
race relations defines, uh, African-American history or Black history.
And [it\'s **simply not true** because much of what people do in terms
of]{.underline}, of [**[social formation]{.mark}**, **community
building**]{.underline}, um, is, is, is what Raymond Williams might call
alternative cultures. In other words, it [[may be **structured in
dominance**]{.mark} in some ways, [but **not defined by**]{.mark}
**it**]{.underline}. And [Cedric]{.underline}\'s Black Marxism, you
know, really made this point. He [talks about the **ontological
totality**]{.underline}, you know, the, this sense of being and making
ourselves whole, in that we come out of an experience, again, structured
by white supremacy, structured by violence, [**structured by
enslavement** and **dispossession**]{.underline}, but, [but one in which
**western hegemony didn\'t work**]{.underline}, you know, that modes of
thinking wasn\'t defined by Enlightenment modes of thinking. In other
words, that, that [part of the [Black radical tradition is]{.mark} a
**[refusal to be property]{.mark}**, to **even admit that human beings
could be property**]{.underline}. You know, so [[we]{.mark} sometimes
[give white supremacy]{.mark} **way [too much
credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and maybe I misunderstood the question.
And so I think that there\'s lots of things that happen outside of joy
and survival, and survival is important, but survival is not the end
all, you know. So I think, and I\'ll give you one very, very specific
example, and now I\'m not gonna say anything else after this. [The way
we have tended to more recently [treat **slavery**, **Jim Crow** and
**mass incarceration**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a piece, [[as]{.mark} the
**reinstantiation of [the same thing]{.mark}**, the **continuation**,
that **[denies]{.mark} the fact** [that these]{.mark} systems
[are]{.mark} **actually [distinct]{.mark}**, that they are
**historically specific**, [and]{.mark} in fact they're
**[responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} to, in many ways, [[to]{.mark} [the
**weakness** of]{.mark} this as [a racial regime]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So if you think of like the whole idea of the new Jim Crow to me is
very, very problematic. Um, although that book by Michelle Alexander is
very, very powerful and very useful in terms of educating people about
prisons. [Jim Crow was **not the continuation of slavery**]{.underline}.
It was not. [[Jim Crow was a **response to the Black
Democratic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, uh, [**[upsurge]{.mark}** after
slavery]{.underline}. It was a revolution of Reconstruction. [It was a
way to try to suppress that]{.underline}. The fact that, that, you know,
there was this incredible response. [That\'s why]{.underline} there\'s
a, [there\'s [a **huge gap** between]{.mark} 1877 at [the]{.mark}
official [end of Reconstruction and]{.mark} the [rise of Jim
Crow]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [the 1890s, disfranchisement,
lynching]{.underline}. That\'s because [you\'ve had **13**, **14**,
**15**, **20**, [**25 years** of]{.mark} a **[democratic
possibility]{.mark}** and **struggle**. The **same thing with mass
incarceration**---yes, we\'ve had incarceration, but]{.underline} it\'s,
but that, that, that, [that **upward swing** has a lot to do with,
again, **responses** to the struggles in the 1960s]{.underline}, the
assault on the Keynesian welfare-warfare state, the fact that you know
the, the war on political, the formation of political prisoners, those
struggles in fact was the state\'s response to opposition. And so [if we
**don\'t acknowledge that**]{.underline}, then [what we end up doing is
thinking that somehow there\'s a structure of white supremacy that\'s
**unchanging**, **fixed**, and **so powerful we can\'t do anything about
it** when in fact it\'s the **opposite**. [White supremacy is
**fragile**]{.mark}. White supremacy is [**weak**. Racial
regimes]{.mark} actually are **[always]{.mark} having to [shore
themselves up]{.mark}** precisely [because they\'re
**unstable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can see that. [We **can\'t see
it** because the whole system]{.underline} of hegemony [is to give us
the impression that it is **so powerful**, there\'s **no space out**.
And yet it's **working overtime**]{.underline} to, [to **respond to our
opposition**]{.underline}. Right. That may not answer your question, but
that\'s sort of a way I think about it. Maybe it's not satisfactory, but
yeah.

GR\]

[It would be **easy** to see]{.underline} in all this [**powerful
evidence** that racism is a **permanent fixture**]{.underline} in
America's social fabric [and]{.underline} even, perhaps, an
**[inevitable]{.underline}** aspect of human nature. Indeed, the mere
act of labeling others according to their age, gender, or race is a
reflexive habit of the human mind. Social categories, like race, impact
our thinking quickly, often outside of our awareness. Extensive research
has found that these implicit racial biases---negative thoughts and
feelings about people from other races---are automatic, pervasive, and
difficult to suppress. [**[Neuroscientists]{.mark}** have also
[explored]{.mark} **racial [prejudice]{.mark}** [by exposing people
to]{.mark}]{.underline} images of faces while scanning their brains in
**[[fMRI]{.mark} machines]{.underline}**. Early studies found that when
people viewed faces of another race, the amount of activity in the
amygdala---a small brain structure associated with experiencing
emotions, including fear---was associated with individual differences on
implicit measures of racial bias. This work has led many to conclude
that racial biases might be part of a primitive---and possibly
hard-wired---neural fear response to racial out-groups.

There is little question that categories such as race, gender, and age
play a major role in shaping the biases and stereotypes that people
bring to bear in their judgments of others. However, research has shown
that how people categorize themselves may be just as fundamental to
understanding prejudice as how they categorize others. When people
categorize themselves as part of a group, their self-concept shifts from
the individual ("I") to the collective level ("us"). People form groups
rapidly and favor members of their own group even when groups are formed
on arbitrary grounds, such as the simple flip of a coin. These findings
highlight the remarkable ease with which humans form coalitions.

Recent **[[research confirms]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[**[coalition]{.mark}-based preference[s]{.mark}** [trump
**race**]{.mark}**-based preferences**]{.underline}. For example, both
[[**Democrats and Republicans** favor]{.underline}]{.mark} the resumes
of those affiliated with [[their]{.mark} **political
[party]{.mark}**]{.underline} [much [more than]{.mark} they
favor]{.underline} those who share **[their
[race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These coalition-based preferences remain
powerful even in the absence of the animosity present in electoral
politics. Our research has shown that the simple act of placing people
on a mixed-race team can diminish their automatic racial bias. In a
series of experiments, White participants who were randomly placed on a
mixed-race team---the Tigers or Lions---showed little evidence of
implicit racial bias. [**Merely [belonging]{.mark}** [to a **mixed-race
team** trigged **positive** ]{.mark}**automatic
[associations]{.mark}**]{.underline} with all of the members of their
own group, irrespective of race. Being a part of one of these seemingly
trivial mixed-race groups produced similar effects on brain
activity---[[the **amygdala** responded to **team**]{.mark}
**membership** [rather than **race**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken
together, these studies indicate that momentary changes in group
membership can override the influence of race on the way we see, think
about, and feel toward people who are different from ourselves.

Although these coalition-based distinctions might be the most basic
building block of bias, they say little about the other factors that
cause group conflict. Why do some groups get ignored while others get
attacked? Whenever we encounter a new person or group we are motivated
to answer two questions as quickly as possible: "is this person a friend
or foe?" and "are they capable of enacting their intentions toward me?"
In other words, once we have determined that someone is a member of an
out-group, we need to determine what kind? The nature of the relations
between groups---are we cooperative, competitive, or neither?---and
their relative status---do you have access to resources?---largely
determine the course of intergroup interactions.

Groups that are seen as competitive with one's interests, and capable of
enacting their nasty intentions, are much more likely to be targets of
hostility than more benevolent (e.g., elderly) or powerless (e.g.,
homeless) groups. This is one reason why sports rivalries have such
psychological potency. For instance, fans of the Boston Red Sox are more
likely to feel pleasure, and exhibit reward-related neural responses, at
the misfortunes of the archrival New York Yankees than other baseball
teams (and vice versa)---especially in the midst of a tight playoff
race. (How much fans take pleasure in the misfortunes of their rivals is
also linked to how likely they would be to harm fans from the other
team.)

Just as a particular person's group membership can be flexible, so too
are the relations between groups. Groups that have previously had
cordial relations may become rivals (and vice versa). Indeed,
[**[psychological]{.mark} and biological** [responses to **out-group**
members]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}can
**[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, depending on whether or not that
out-group is perceived as threatening. For example, people exhibit
greater pleasure---they smile---in response to the misfortunes of
stereotypically competitive groups (e.g., investment bankers); however,
this malicious pleasure is reduced when you provide participants with
counter-stereotypic information (e.g., "investment bankers are working
with small companies to help them weather the economic downturn).
Competition between "us" and "them" can even distort our judgments of
distance, making threatening out-groups seem much closer than they
really are. These distorted perceptions can serve to amplify intergroup
discrimination: the more different and distant "they" are, the easier it
is to disrespect and harm them.

Thus, not all out-groups are treated the same: some elicit indifference
whereas others become targets of antipathy. Stereotypically threatening
groups are especially likely to be targeted with violence, but those
[[**stereotypes** can be **tempered** with]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[**[info]{.mark}rmation**[. If]{.mark}]{.underline} perceptions of
intergroup relations can be changed, [[individuals]{.mark} may
**[overcome hostility]{.mark}** toward perceived foes [and
become]{.mark} **more [responsive]{.mark}**]{.underline} to one
another's grievances.

[[The **flexible nature**]{.underline}]{.mark} of both group membership
and intergroup relations [[offers **reason** to be]{.mark} cautiously
[**optimistic** about]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the potential for
greater **[[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** among groups in conflict
(be they black versus white or citizens versus police). One strategy is
to bring multiple groups together around a common goal. For example,
during the fiercely contested 2008 Democratic presidential primary
process, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama supporters gave more money to
strangers who supported the same primary candidate (compared to the
rival candidate). Two months later, after the Democratic National
Convention, the supporters of both candidates coalesced around the party
nominee---Barack Obama---and this bias disappeared. In fact, merely
[[creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a sense of [[cohesion]{.mark} between
two competitive groups [can **increase empathy**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the suffering of our rivals. These sorts of strategies can [help
**[reduce aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward hostile out-groups,
[[which is **critical** for]{.mark} creating more opportunities for
**constructive [dialogue]{.mark}** [addressing]{.mark} greater **social
[injustices]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Of course, instilling a sense of common identity and cooperation is
extremely difficult in entrenched intergroup conflicts, but when it
happens, the benefits are obvious. Consider how the community leaders in
New York City and Ferguson responded differently to protests against
police brutality---in NYC political leaders expressed grief and concern
over police brutality and moved quickly to make policy changes in
policing, whereas the leaders and police in Ferguson responded with
high-tech military vehicles and riot gear. In the first case, multiple
groups came together with a common goal---to increase the safety of
everyone in the community; in the latter case, the actions of the police
likely reinforced the "us" and "them" distinctions.

Tragically, these types of conflicts continue to roil the country.
Understanding the psychology and neuroscience of social identity and
intergroup relations cannot undo the effects of systemic racism and
discriminatory practices; however, it can offer insights into the
psychological processes responsible for escalating the tension between,
for example, civilians and police officers.

Even in cases where it isn't possible to create a common identity among
groups in conflict, it may be possible to blur the boundaries between
groups. In one recent experiment, we sorted participants into
groups---red versus blue team---competing for a cash prize. Half of the
participants were randomly assigned to see a picture of a segregated
social network of all the players, in which red dots clustered together,
blue dots clustered together, and the two clusters were separated by
white space. The other half of the participants saw an integrated social
network in which the red and blue dots were mixed together in one large
cluster. Participants who thought the two teams were interconnected with
one another reported greater empathy for the out-group players compared
to those who had seen the segregated network. Thus, reminding people
that individuals could be connected to one another despite being from
different groups may be another way to build trust and understanding
among them.

A mere month before Freddie Gray died in police custody, President Obama
addressed the nation on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma:
"We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and
discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to
America. To deny...progress \-- our progress \-- would be to rob us of
our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America
better.\"

The president was saying that we, as a society, have a responsibility to
reduce prejudice and discrimination. These recent findings from
psychology and neuroscience indicate that we, as individuals, possess
this capacity. Of course, this capacity is not sufficient to usher in
racial equality or peace. Even when the level of prejudice against
particular out-groups decreases, it does not imply that the level of
institutional discrimination against these or other groups will
necessarily improve. Ultimately, [[only **collective**]{.mark}
**action** and **institutional [evolution]{.mark}** can [address]{.mark}
**systemic [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [science is
**clear**]{.mark}]{.underline} on one thing, though: individual bias and
discrimination are changeable. [**[Race]{.mark}-based
[prejudice]{.mark}** and discrimination]{.underline}, in particular,
[[are]{.mark} created and reinforced by]{.underline} many [social
factors]{.underline}, [but they are [**not inevitable** consequences
of]{.mark} **our [biology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps understanding
how coalitional thinking impacts intergroup relations will make it
easier for us to affect real social change going forward.

#### Psychoanalysis is nonfalsifiable

(link credit to EM)

[WE SHOULD congratulate the Science Museum for setting up an exhibition
on psychoanalysis. Exposure to pseudoscience]{.underline} greatly h[elps
understand genuine science, just as learning about tyranny helps in
understanding democracy.]{.underline} [[Over]{.mark} the past [30
years,]{.mark} **[psychoanalysis has]{.mark}** quietly **[been
displaced]{.mark}** in academia [by scientific psychology.]{.mark} But
it persists in popular culture]{.underline} as well as being a lucrative
profession. [It is the psychology of those who have not bothered to
learn psychology]{.underline}, and the psychotherapy of choice for those
who believe in the power of immaterial mind over body.
[**[Psychoanalysis is]{.mark} a [bogus]{.mark} science** because **its
practitioners do not do scientific research**]{.underline}. When the
field turned 100, a group of [[psychoanalysts admitted this gap]{.mark}
and endeavoured to fill it. They claimed to have performed the first
experiment]{.underline} showing that patients benefited from their
treatment. Regrettably, **[[they did not include a control group and did
not entertain]{.mark} the possibility of [placebo
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Hence, their claim remains
untested]{.underline} (The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, vol
81, p 513). More recently, a meta-analysis published in American
Psychologist (vol 65, p 98) purported to support the claim that a form
of psychoanalysis called psychodynamic therapy is effective. However,
once again, the original studies did not involve control groups. [In
[110 years, psychoanalysts have not set up a single lab]{.mark}. They do
not participate in scientific congresses,]{.underline} do not submit
their papers to scientific journals and are foreign to the scientific
community - [a marginality typical of pseudoscience]{.underline}. This
does not mean [their hypotheses]{.underline} have never been put to the
test. True, they [are so vague that they are hard to test and some of
them]{.underline} [are]{.underline}, by Freud\'s own admission,
[irrefutable]{.underline}. Still, [most of the testable ones have been
soundly refuted]{.underline}. [For example, most dreams have no sexual
content. The Oedipus complex is a myth]{.underline}; boys do not hate
their fathers because they would like to have sex with their mothers.
[The list goes on.]{.underline} As for therapeutic efficacy, little is
known because psychoanalysts do not perform double-blind clinical trials
or follow-up studies. Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience. Its concepts
are woolly and untestable yet are regarded as unassailable axioms. As a
result of such dogmatism, [psychoanalysis has remained basically
stagnant for more than a century, in contrast with scientific
psychology, which is thriving.]{.underline}

### A2: Warren

#### Warren's understanding of fungibility is [ahistorical]{.underline}

**Mahoney, 19**---M.A. candidate in Liberal Studies at Dartmouth
(Sommer, "(de)Humanization and Onticide: Lexicography for Ontology,"
CLAMANTIS: The MALS Journal: Vol. 1: No. 5, Article 5, dml)

Calvin [[**Warren** would]{.underline}]{.mark} pause here to
[[reassert]{.mark} his claims about slavery---[that slavery's]{.mark}
economic [violence **created**]{.mark} and **reaffirmed the [white
identity]{.mark}**, and did so through the **commodification of the
slave** into a **fungible object**]{.underline}. My argument against him
is twofold. First: [if we can **trace the history of the moral schema**
that produced this fungibility, does that not mean that fungibility was
**invented**, and can be **uninvented**? Is it not **possible** (**not a
universally recognized truth**, but a **possibility**) that there is a
**way to unmake the schema** that created whiteness and ritually
sacrificed blackness? Perhaps]{.underline} Calvin [Warren would argue
that no, there is no way]{.underline}---because the black ontology is
being perpetually sacrificed and destroyed, there is no way to stop that
cycle. [It is an **endless feedback cycle**]{.underline}, he would
argue---and as it spins, it maintains its integrity (sacrifice and
creation), and progresses forward, consuming each black ontology as each
black baby is born. [But]{.underline} here we can return to Kate Manne.
Ignore Warren's protestations for a moment, and [consider]{.underline}
the second part of my two-fold argument: [even if the morality of agency
schema **brought about white identity**, is it possible that [black
people have]{.mark}]{.underline} consistency [[**rejected** and **fought
off**]{.mark} **these [assaults]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} their
[ontology]{.mark}? Is it possible that **music**, **art**, **dance**,
**religion**, **protest** and **defiance**---all of which were **rich
[traditions]{.mark}** [in slave culture]{.mark}---[indicated]{.mark} a
[**truth** that white violence **could not reach**]{.mark} because it
**cannot understand**?]{.underline} Here I would like to propose a new
way to look at dehumanization: (de)humanization. The parentheses
indicate liminal space between action and thought, the place where
destruction and construction are in harmony. [To **de-humanize**, to
**take away humanity**, is an **action**. [By definition]{.mark}, it is
an action [that **can only be done to a human**]{.mark}. To **strip away
humanity**, [the perpetrator must]{.mark} actually]{.underline} (like
Manne suggests) [**[recognize their victim as human]{.mark}**. You
wouldn't call a monkey a "monkey!" as an insult because a) you recognize
this to be a **factual statement**, and b) a monkey has **no capacity to
understand** what an "insult" is, and **cannot feel insulted**. A
person, especially a black person, can feel **embarrassed**,
**threatened**, or **degraded**]{.underline} by being called a monkey.
[[If slavers **actually thought** black humans were not humans---**why
build an ontology around (de)humanizing**]{.mark}? How could that
practice **withstand the test of time**: [**either** it would]{.mark}
**have to [stop]{.mark}**[, because]{.mark} black people [were
**successfully denied humanity**]{.mark} and there would be **no more
reason to (de)humanize**, [or]{.mark} the very [attempts]{.mark} of
de-humanization **actually [reaffirm]{.mark} the [essential
humanity]{.mark}** possessed by each human]{.underline}.

#### You can't have metaphysics without ontology 

**Heckman 17** (Ian Heckman, PhD candidate in philosophy and aesthetics,
\"What is the difference between metaphysics and ontology?\", Quora,
June 4 2017,
<https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-metaphysics-and-ontology>,
mmv)

[**[Ontology is the study of what things exist]{.mark}** and what kinds
of things they are]{.underline}. A completed ontology is an ontology
that states what things exist in the world. There might be one
individual thing in which everything else is merely a property of that
one thing (Spinoza). There might be lots of little things, namely
fundamental particles, and things like chairs and tables are really just
arrangements of those particles. (Reductionism). It's about carving up
the world and seeing what really exists and how many things exist.

[**[Once we have an ontology, we can finish]{.mark} building the rest of
our [metaphysic]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}. A completed metaphysics is a full
picture of reality. This is not just a picture consisting of what things
exist, but it is a picture which understands the objects posited by the
ontology both how they work, and how they interact with one
another]{.underline}. This picture is ultimately much more informative
than merely an ontology.

For example, an ontology of the mind might posit two fundamental
substances, a spiritual substance and a material substance. But then a
metaphysical but non-ontological question is how do these two substances
interact? And more importantly, how can they interact, given that their
natures are so substantially different from one another? And this gives
rise to the mind-body problem.

[It should be clear that a complete [**metaphysics** **is always going
to include an ontology**]{.mark}**,** but not vice versa. You can always
posit entities without saying much about understanding them. But you
can't understand how reality works without knowing what kinds of
entities exist]{.underline}.

#### Hope is good for black people -- we cite the *[best]{.underline}* study 

**Davidson et al 2010** (Collin L. Davidson, MS, LaRicka R. Wingate,
PhD, Meredith L. Slish, MS, and Kathy A. Rasmussen, MS, \"The Great
Black Hope: Hope and Its Relation to Suicide Risk among African
Americans\", Suice and Life-Threatening Behavior, 40(2) April 2010, The

mmv)

The results from this study are generally consistent with our
hypotheses. Specifically, [hope negatively predicted thwarted
belongingness and perceived burdensomeness while predicting acquired
capability to enact suicide in the positive direction]{.underline}.
[These results suggest that as a whole, [hope]{.mark} may serve to
[buffer African American]{.mark} individuals **[against
suicide]{.mark}**, consistent with previous findings in other ethnic
groups]{.underline} (Davidson et al., in press; Range & Penton, 1994).
As discussed above and in a previous study (Davidson et al., in press),
[the marginal positive prediction of hope for acquired capability to
enact suicide may be due to the tendency of people with high hopes to
set more goals and more challenging goals, thus possibly putting
themselves in more situations where they would be likely to experience
pain]{.underline}. If the experience of pain became frequent enough,
these individuals would theoretically habituate to the pain resulting in
higher levels of acquired capability to enact suicide. Further, [it was
found that hope and the pathways subscale significantly predicted
suicidal ideation such that higher hope scores predicted less suicidal
ideation]{.underline}. In contrast, the goals and agency subscales did
not significantly predict suicidal ideation. This suggests that simply
having the goal or agency to enact suicide is not enough---the strength
of the relationship is in the pathway or plans to enact suicide. This is
consistent with previous research that has shown that plans and
preparations for suicide are one of the strongest predictors for suicide
completion (Joiner, Rudd, & Rajah, 1997); stronger even than the desire
to enact suicide. These findings may relate to the significant
prediction of the pathways component to suicidal ideation. Taken
[together with the aforementioned results, this suggests that hope
serves as a protective factor for both suicidal risk as described in the
interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide]{.underline} (Joiner,
2005) [and suicidal ideation]{.underline}. [These results are contrary
to previous findings]{.underline} (Davidson et al., in press) [which
showed that although higher hope did predict lower burdensomeness and
thwarted belongingness, hope did not predict suicidal
ideation]{.underline}. It is possible that, [[among African Americans,
hope **plays a larger role as a protective factor**]{.mark} for suicide
**[in comparison to a]{.mark}** predominantly **[Caucasian
sample]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, we investigated the
differences between the two samples and [found that the African American
sample had significantly higher levels of hope, goals, and agency and
that each of these scales had larger standard deviations than the
predominantly Caucasian sample]{.underline}. It is possible that [the
larger variability of scores contributed to the likelihood of
significant findings]{.underline}. Future research should aim to clarify
this relationship. Finally, consistent with our third hypothesis, it was
found that the components of Joiners (2005) theory of suicidal behavior
together predicted suicidal ideation. These results offer further
support for the validity of Joiners theory in conjunction with the
existing empirical studies that support this theory. Additionally, these
results further expand the generalizability of Joiner\'s theory to an
African American sample. Although the components as a set predicted
suicidal ideation, when examined individually, only burden-someness and
belongingness individually predict suicidal ideation, while acquired
capability does not. This finding is not consistent with a previous
study that examined the theory in a largely Caucasian population (David-
son et al., in press), wherein each component separately predicted
suicidal ideation. Joiner proposed that for an individual to desire
suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness must be
elevated, whereas for an individual to physically carry out a suicide
attempt, they must have higher acquired capability to enact suicide.
Theoretically then, it may be that individuals who only have elevated
levels of acquired capability may not have suicidal ideation because
they have no desire to end their lives. Again, future research should
further investigate this relationship. One limitation of the current
study is that the [sample]{.underline} is not particularly diverse, as
it [is composed only of people who self-identified as African
American]{.underline}. However, it is of note that this is the first
study to our knowledge to examine Joiners theory of suicidal behavior in
an African American sample. It is ideal to generalize the presence of
theoretical findings to many different populations. Regarding this
situation. Popper (1959, p. 269) stated, \"once a theory is well
corroborated, further instances raise its degree of corroboration only
very little. This ride however does not hold good if these new instances
are very different from the earlier ones, that is if they corroborate
the theory in a new field of application\" (emphasis added). [Although
the participants in this study were African American, they were somewhat
diverse in their place of living, and came from all over the Big XII
conference area, including the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,
Missouri, Iowa, Texas, and Colorado]{.underline}. In line with the
previous limitation, it is important to note that there is a great
amount of diversity among Black people, lo elaborate, there are cultural
differences related to the geographic location in which a person lives
(all of our participants were living in the midwest), as well as their
ethnic heritage and recent ancestors\' country of origin (United States,
Africa, Caribbean Islands, etc.). Given the heterogeneity among Black
people in America, it is important that researchers attend to ethnic
differences among Blacks in the study of suicide related behaviors.
Future studies should work to investigate risk factors within Black
groups. Some may consider the focus on a relatively low-risk group of
participants (African American college students) a limitation of our
study; however, a great deal of research on suicidal behavior and risk
factors has been conducted with college samples. In addition, we
specifically took the stance of examining suicidal behavior from a
positive psychology approach, as suggested in Wingate et al. (2006).
Given that the rate of suicide for African Americans has been
consistendy low in comparison to Caucasian Americans, it may be
beneficial to identify the protective factors that help to temper the
risk. Once these protective factors are identified in African Americans,
it may then be possible to implement and encourage these factors in
other ethnic groups. This emphasis on buffers against suicide risk may
serve to supplement the existing emphasis on suicide risk factors in
clinical practice. Indeed, [research has shown that hope tends to
protect individuals from negative outcomes in mental health]{.underline}
(e.g., depression and anxiety) [and the current study and previous
studies have suggested that hope can also protect against suicide
risk]{.underline} (Davidson et al, in press; Range & Penton, 1994). [It
is possible that [instilling hope]{.mark} in clients **[can provide
incremental increases in]{.mark} client [safety\']{.mark}** **above and
[beyond]{.mark} the [common clinical practices]{.mark}** of identifying
and protecting clients from risk factors to ensure their
safety\']{.underline}. Indeed, Stellrecht et al. (2006) highlighted the
importance of applying research to the clinical setting and provided
recommendations for using the interpersonal-psychological theory of
suicide in risk assessment, crisis intervention, and general therapy.
[Specific to African Americans, it may prove beneficial for clinicians
to use techniques that encourage increased feelings of belongingness
within, and contributions to, the African American community. This could
include having the client become involved in activities where they are a
member of a group, where they give back, and where they have
similarities to others in the group]{.underline}. Cognitive techniques
could be used to address distorted cognitions surrounding feelings of
burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Similarly, drawing from hope
theory, [clinicians may be able to focus on challenging cognitive
distortions related to a lack of hope, subsequendy increasing hope as a
protective factor]{.underline}. They may also be able to capitalize on
the hope that clients already possess when presenting to therapy, and
work to generalize that hope to areas of the clients life where it is
lacking. Though the current findings may inform prevention and treatment
of suicidal behavior in the future, it should be noted that additional
research is required to confirm some of these potential applications.
The findings from the current study are important in that they replicate
and extend the findings of Davidson et al. (in press), which
demonstrated that hope served as a protective factor for suicide risk in
a largely Caucasian sample. [As mentioned earlier, **[African Americans
tend to be at higher risk for suicide due to overrepresentation in lower
socioeconomic-status environments]{.mark}**, associated [**stress, and
discrimination,**]{.mark} but they enact suicide at lower
rates]{.underline}. Some researchers have hypothesized (see Gibbs, 1997)
that this paradox is due to protective factors such as religiosity or
strong family ties. [The current study adds to these assertions by
demonstrating that hope is potentially an important protective factor
for African Americans]{.underline}. To our knowledge, [this is the only
study that has investigated suicide from a positive psychology
perspective in an African American sample, and one of few studies to do
so in a general sample]{.underline}.

### AT: Communication is Bad

#### Communication and meaning are [possible]{.underline} and [desirable]{.underline} -- framing speech as pure flux destroys any benefits gained from [intersubjective processes of meaning]{.underline} in [specific political contexts]{.underline}

**Merawi 11** (Fasil, Addis Ababa University, Master's Thesis in
Philosophy, "Habermas and the Discourse of Modernity,"
http://etd.aau.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/3596/3/FASIL%20MERAWI.pdf)

As Culler sees it, Derrida raised three main objections towards Searle's
speech act theory. First, any speech act can be quoted and be analyzed
in another context and the idea that meaning will be the same in another
context, is something fictional. Habermas criticized Derrida for failing
to recognize that what Austin meant by the fixation of meaning in
everyday communication and the normal use of language, is based on
idealizing presuppositions that are present in every communicative
action (PDM, 195-196). Second, Derrida argued that, for a normal speech
act to be successfully employed, meaning needs to be arrested, and this
to be done by presenting general rules and conditions under which a
given utterance is to be employed and analyzed. But speech acts can have
different meanings depending on the contexts. Here, Derrida speaks of
'grafting' i.e. that a speech act can be quoted in another context. So,
the contexts are infinite and one cannot come up with a theory of the
employment of speech acts specifying where and how they should be
employed since meaning is contextual, and the contexts are many. Here,
culler supports Derrida's argument by claiming that even the "intentions
of the speakers\...are to be interpreted in different contexts." (PDM,
197) Searle objected to Derrida's second argument, by asserting that,
what prevents flux and fluctuation of meaning is not found in what is
uttered, but the general assumptions in which it is uttered. So, [[when
using speech]{.underline}]{.mark} acts [[on a day to day level,
participants are operating within a set of assumptions]{.mark} that
define what something normally means]{.underline} and does not mean.
Further, [[the assumptions within]{.mark} which
[speech]{.mark}]{.underline} acts occur, **[are not]{.underline}**
theoretical **[constructs]{.underline}** that are [**built to arrest
meaning**, [but **necessary assumptions behind the process of
communication**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, Derrida, against Searle
argued that, it is the potential of the text to be interpreted in many
ways and not our intentions and assumptions that make different
interpretations possible. So, the text by itself plays a context
creating function. As Habermas sees it, [as long as participants in an
intersubjectivist communicative process are oriented towards
understanding]{.underline}, then [meaning will not be
deferred]{.underline}. **[[Wrong interpretations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and abnormal usages of language **[[could be]{.underline}]{.mark}**
simply **[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark}** as something that hinders
consensus and understanding. Idealizations that are found beyond
communicative action and the fact that the various claims raised during
communication are open to critique, and can be empirically tested will
easily help to "distinguish between 'usual' and 'parasitic' uses of
language" (PDM, 199). By 'parasitic', Habermas meant that the normal use
of language in everyday communication is for reaching understanding.
Other artistic, metaphorical and non-literal usages of language are
derived from the normal usage. Further, eventhough 'parasitic' usages of
language prevail in everyday communication; still actors are able to
bypass these usages since they are oriented towards reaching
understanding. By revising the Derrida/Searle debate and employing his
arguments as well, Habermas believes that, he managed to defend his
communicative rationality with its validity claims. In everyday
communication [[the infinite flow of meaning]{.underline}]{.mark},
poetic and rhetoric elements [[are **put**]{.underline}]{.mark}s
**[[aside for the sake of understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Having
done this, Habermas wants to refute the idea that there is no
distinction between logic and rhetoric and that all texts can be
analyzed on literary and rhetorical terms. The issue as, Habermas sees
it, is the acceptance that all language contains literary and rhetorical
elements, while at the same time defending philosophy and the special
forms of inquiry against the domination of literary elements, and hence
the viewing of their validity claims as something impure and
contaminated with artistic and metaphorical elements. Habermas, claims
that Derrida's general notion of text as a mixture of Heterogeneous
elements, makes him blind to the fact that [[in everyday communication
there is the possibility to]{.underline}]{.mark} raise and [[defend
claims in **reference to**]{.underline}]{.mark} the three
**[[validity]{.underline}]{.mark}** claims, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the various [[specialized]{.underline}]{.mark} forms of
[[inquiry]{.underline}]{.mark} are also [[oriented towards **solving
specific problems**]{.underline}]{.mark} (PDM, 205). Habermas thinks
that there is an affinity between Rorty and Derrida in relation to their
views on language, communicating subjects. In Rorty, the languages of
the sciences and other forms of inquiries create the contexts that
necessarily determine everyday communication. Further, the capacity of
validity claims to challenged inherited horizons is unacknowledged.
(PDM, 206) Furthermore, both Derrida and Rorty, failed to distinguish
between everyday interaction in which distinct validity claims are
raised, and the various forms of inquiry that are geared toward solving
specific problems (PDM, 207). Derrida is accused by Habermas of failing
to distinguish between how language has a capacity of making the world
visible and intelligible and how it can be used to solve specific
problems. So, Derrida in his general notion of a 'text' tried to merge
all the sciences, including philosophy, criticism, art, literature and
so on under one category of literature. Habermas claims that on the one
hand, we have everyday world of communication based in the different
validity claims, while on the other, the various specialized forms of
inquiry that are geared at solving specific problems. Philosophy and
literary criticism are found between the two. Literary criticism
connects everyday world and the artistic realm, while philosophy, is
related to the forms of inquiries in having a universalistic dimension.
Philosophy facilitates disputation of claims between everyday world and
specialized inquiries. (PDM, 207-208)

### AT: Debate is Bad

#### Agonistic debate SOLVES collapse and oversaturation of meaning 

Bryan S. **Turner 4**, Dean of Social Sciences at Deakin University,
Australia, "Baudrillard for Sociologists," in Forget Baudrillard?, 2004
edition, p. 80-83

#### While, as far as one can tell, Baudrillard was not influenced by Bell's vision of the role of technology and the media in shaping postindustrialism, he was influenced by Marshall McLuhan's analysis (Gane 1991b:48) of the impact of new media on the transformation of modern culture, especially in The Gutenberg Galaxy (McLuhan 1967). McLuhan was particularly sensitive to the idea that we live in a processed social world where human beings live in a complete technostructure. This technological environment is carried with us as extensions of our own bodies, but McLuhan did not adopt a pessimistic view of the age of anxiety, because his 'technological humanism' (Kroker et al. 1984) and Catholic values committed him to the idea of the immanence of reason and the hope of an escape from the labyrinth. Indeed, a global technological system could become the basis of a universalistic culture. Although he was fully aware of the sensory deprivation which he associated with the impact of the mass media, he none the less remained committed to the hope that these negative effects were not fatal. [[Baudrillard]{.mark}, who]{.underline} as we have noted [was]{.underline} deeply [influenced by McLuhan's idea that **the content of messages was**]{.underline} relatively **[unimportant in relation to their form]{.underline}**, [has [embraced a]{.mark}]{.underline} very [**[nihilistic position]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with respect to our]{.underline} **[processed environment]{.underline}**.¶ [Baudrillard's pessimistic view]{.underline} of the fissure in the historical development of the modern [is based on his view of the masses]{.underline}. Baudrillard's analysis of the masses is a product of the Situationist responses to the May events of 1968, when it became increasingly obvious that the critical social movements of modern society would not be dominated by Marxist theory or directed by a vanguard of the working class. The crisis of May 1968 had not been predicted by Marxism or by mainstream sociology, but they did validate the claims of Situationists like Guy Debord in the journal Internationale Situationiste. However, if the crisis had been unanticipated by conventional political analysis, then the sudden collapse of the students' and workers' movements of 1968 found no easy explanation in the framework of mainstream social sciences.¶ Baudrillard's concept of the inexplicable nature of the mass depend a great deal on the unusual circumstances surrounding the May events. By 1973 with the publication of The Mirror of Production (Baudrillard 1975), Baudrillard was already moving away from an orthodox Marxist view of production, arguing that Marxism, far from being an external critique of capitalism, was merely a reflection or mirror of the principal economistic values of capitalism. **[[Instead of engaging in]{.mark} the [production of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [a subversive, oppositional movement would have to challenge the system from the point of view of]{.underline} **[meaninglessness]{.underline}**. Subversion would have to rob the social system of significance. In taking this stand, Baudrillard followed the Situationist claim that whatever can be represented can be controlled (Plant 1992:137). The mass events of 1968 offered a promise of the nonrepresentational moment, the pure event of authenticity, which could not be explained, and therefore could not be manipulated. Baudrillard, in dismissing Marxist theory as a means of representing events, sought to replace the idea of a mode of production with a mode of disappearance.¶ In taking this attitude towards modern social movements, Baudrillard's argument also rests on the various meanings of the word 'mass'. Baudrillard is thus able to make allusions to the idea of physical substance, matter, the majority and the electrical meaning of earth. The translator's note to In the Shadow of the Silent Majority points out that faire masse can mean to form a majority and to form an earth. Baudrillard argues by allusion that the mass absorbs the electrical charges of social and political movements; the mass thus neutralizes the electrical charge of society. This use of allusion, parody and irony is typical of Baudrillard's mode of analysis, which is a type of sociological poetics, a style which is likely to make sociologists feel uncomfortable (Gane 199la:193). There is here also a continuity with the style of Dada and the Situationists. The poetic and striking character of [Baudrillard's style]{.underline} **[has no counterpart in professional social science]{.underline}**, least of all in the British context.¶ [Baudrillard's 'sociological fictions']{.underline} (1990a:15) are striking and challenging, but they **[are not]{.underline}** ultimately **[convincing]{.underline}**. [Arguments which depend on allusion, allegory and]{.underline} similar [rhetorical devices are decorative but they are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[powerful]{.underline}**. The notion of 'mass society' already has a clearly worked out sociological critique. The idea of 'mass society' might have been relevant in describing the new markets which were created in the post-war period with the advent of innovative technologies, which had the immediate effect of lowering prices and making commodities available to a mass audience. However, the trend of sociological analysis in the last two decades has been to assert that [mass audiences have been broken down into more selectively constructed niches]{.underline} for more individualized products. It is controversial to argue that industrialization necessarily produces a mass society, characterized by a common culture, uniform sentiments or an integrated outlook. The idea of a mass society was often associated with the notion that the decline of individualism would produce a directionless mass as the modern equivalent of the eighteenthcentury mob. Critical theorists like Adorno and Marcuse associated the massification of society with authoritarianism and a potential for fascism. Of course, [[Baudrillard's version of mass society is]{.mark} based on [a]{.mark}]{.underline} particular **[[view of the mass media creating]{.mark} a [hyperreality]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in which the real has been absorbed by the hyperreal]{.underline}; **[meaning has imploded on itself]{.underline}**. Although Baudrillard's analysis of hyperreality is postcritical (Chen 1987), he does adopt in practice a critical position towards American civilization, which is the extreme example of massification. Rather like critical theorists, Baudrillard believes that the (bourgeois) individual has been sucked into the negative electrical mass of the media age. [However,]{.underline} **[sociological research]{.underline}** [on mass audiences shows that]{.underline} **[there is no ground for believing that media messages are received, consumed or used in any standardized manner]{.underline}**, [and [the majority of social scientists]{.mark} working on culture]{.underline} have attempted to [[argue]{.mark} that]{.underline} [[cultural objects]{.underline}]{.mark} in the age of the mass media [[are]{.mark} appropriated, transformed and [consumed]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[in diverse forms and according to various practices]{.underline}**]{.mark} (de Certeau 1984). In fact, [sociologists]{.underline}, largely inspired by the Situationists, [have argued that]{.underline} [everyday life is resistant to massification]{.underline} and that the concrete reality of everyday life-situations is the principal arena within which opposition to massification can be expected. Everyday life was regarded by both Guy Debord and Henri Lefebvre (1991) as the foundation of authenticity. **[[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by arguing that criticism belongs to the period of modernism and not to the age of hyperreality, [has]{.underline} **[[ruled out opposition to the system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least **[[at the level of public debate and formal politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### AT: Meaning isn't Real

#### They get [coopted]{.underline} by fascism. Info's [not dissuasive]{.underline}---shared meaning-making is [inevitable]{.underline} and can generate [positive value]{.underline} and [political change]{.underline}.

**Bailey, 20**---Assistant Professor in Politics in the School of
International Studies at the University of Nottingham (Mark, "Cassirer,
Fatalism and Political Myth: Historical Lessons in the Consequences of
Pessimism for International Relations," *Pessimism in International
Relations*, Chapter 4, pg 57-64, SpringerLink, dml)

Specifically, Heidegger's work was instrumental in sowing [a public mood
of **deep pessimism**]{.underline} about the future [in]{.underline} its
[assertions that humanity is]{.underline} defined by Geworfenheit, the
condition of being involuntarily 'thrown' into the stream of time,
leaving it [**permanently a prisoner** of the conditions and temporality
of its existence]{.underline}.12 Coupled with the successive political
and economic crises of the interwar period---which provided considerable
apparent veracity to the principal theses of both Spengler and
Heidegger)---[this climate of fatalism and pessimism was **fundamentally
explosive**]{.underline}, potentially [creating 'a **pliable
instrument** in the hands of the political leaders']{.underline}.13 In
making these points, Cassirer recognised that [[a]{.mark} culture of
fatalism also represented the **death of politics**]{.underline}. As
Colin Hay explains, '[[fatalism and resignation are the **antithesis**
of politics]{.mark}. The extent to which our destiny is determined by
processes **beyond our control** is the extent to which it is
**non-political**]{.underline}... Similarly, [the extent to which we
entrust our destiny to fate is the extent to which we **deny ourselves**
the capacity to **shape outcomes**]{.underline}',14 [Unable to
**perceive an escape** from their present torment, **[millions of
Germans]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the 1930s [[were prepared to
**surrender their political** and **ethical freedoms**]{.mark} to those
who proclaimed that they could]{.underline}.

It was an attempt to find answers to the questions raised by the rise of
uniquely modern forms of political mythology that spurred Cassirer to
write The Myth of the State. In answer to the crises of the time, the
Nazis proved particularly adept at offering a carefully fabricated,
superficially plausible and emotionally compelling account of the
reasons behind the contemporary political and economic situation that
made the complex and multifaceted beguilingly simple. Moreover, [by
capitalising on a **deep sense of historical fatalism** and
**pessimism**, the **Nazi account** of the reasons for Germany's woes
effectively delivered them **carte blanche** to remake German society
and culture in their **own genocidal image**]{.underline}.

Cassirer's Historical Context

Cassirer was writing in response to a twin crisis in Continental
philosophy and the increasing degeneration of the political situation in
interwar Germany. In many respects, he was embarking on a doomed mission
to save the existing liberal order, consummated in Germany in the
formation of the Weimar Republic. He also sought to preserve the
liberal, Kulturphilosophie tradition of figures such as Goethe, Herder
and Humboldt from being consumed by [**reactionary** and
**anti-rationalist** political and cultural forces]{.underline} in
interwar Germany that despised the fundamental optimism that underpinned
this movement's view of culture as the source of human self-liberation.
The first of these twin philosophical crises was the impact of Darwinism
on philosophy, which Cassirer argued had led to 'a complete anarchy in
thought'.15 The publication of the Origin of the Species (1859) resulted
in a major shift in the character of anthropological philosophy from
mathematical explanations of human nature to biological ones. It
similarly **[encouraged]{.underline}** a widespread belief that the
empirical facts of evolution would similarly lead to a metaphysical
revelation of the fundamental principles underpinning evolution's
dynamic processes of change. This would contribute to [the
**uncritical**]{.underline} projection of the telos of natural evolution
onto the world of culture, and the concomitant [**belief** that a
**cultural telos** could be discerned by reference to the **empirical
facts of human cultural life**. The result was a race to]{.underline}
reduce the evolution of human culture to a primum mobile, so as to
systematise human culture along 'scientific' lines in a quest to
[**prove conclusively the essential unity** and **homogeneity** of human
nature]{.underline}. However, [this race produced multiple theories of
human nature that were at once **reductive** and **utterly mutually
exclusive** in their different accounts of human nature's **essential
motivating force**]{.underline}. Moreover, [they each exhibited a
tendency to be **inflated**]{.underline} (deliberately or otherwise)
[into **Grand Theories of everything**. These exhibited
tendencies]{.underline} that philosopher Mary Midgley later saw as
[reflecting a symbiotic relationship between '**reductionism**' and
'**payoff**': the reduction of social phenomena to a **singular cause**
that then becomes a **universal solution** to all
problems]{.underline}.16

[The appearance of this **multitude of conflicting explanations**
concerning the underlying metaphysical principles of human nature
resulted in a **complete loss** of an '**intellectual centre**'; an
**absence of any general frame of reference** against which
philosophical claims might be **judged for their
veracity**]{.underline}. It also contributed to a growing
personalisation of intellectual disciplines and the increasing
'barbarism of specialization' in philosophy and the social sciences as
more and more disciplines emerged, focusing on ever-more limited aspects
of human activity. [This narrowing of focus, together with the tendency
towards the formation of 'schools' of thought within]{.underline},
between and in some cases across disciplines, [centred on individual
scholars whose words quickly assumed quasi-theological]{.underline} and
eschatological [qualities]{.underline} in the hands of their numerous
disciples. For Cassirer, [this situation was]{.underline} increasingly
intolerable, leading to [a **crisis** in humanity's knowledge of itself
that presented a '**grave threat** to...**ethical** and **cultural
life**']{.underline}.17

The second philosophical crisis that Cassirer confronted was the growing
emergence of Liebensphilosophie, the 'Philosophy of Life', in the early
years of the twentieth century. This was a form of that fundamentally
clashed with the kind of idealist philosophy of Spirit (Geist) that
Cassirer's work typifed. Closely associated with the philosophies of
Kierkegaard, Bergson, Simmel, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Scheler,
Liebensphilosophie completely rejected the historicist optimism
omnipresent in Cassirer's work, which placed a deep-seated faith in the
progress of the human spirit in history. In contrast, Liebenphilosophie
asserted [[an **equally deep-seated**, **reactionary** and **highly
anti-rationalist pessimism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which Geist 'is
seen not as a transformation of life but as alienation, an inauthentic
relationship to Being'.18 Thus, Liebensphilosophie [[sought a more
'**authentic**' and **immediate** mode of existence through]{.mark} the
**rejection of modern rationalism** and the perceived **arid technicism
of modern**, **liberal**, **capitalist civilisation**]{.underline}. In
particular, [it]{.underline} encapsulated a deep disenchantment and
[regarded]{.underline} Cassirer's Enlightenment-based Kantian
[[liberalism as being **fundamentally deluded** in the face
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the experiences of the war and the economic and
political crises that followed.19 Cassirer himself was not entirely
unsympathetic to many of the arguments of the life-philosophers. He was
alive to the threat to modern society presented [by [**technological
alienation** and]{.underline}]{.mark} the manner in which **[[consumer
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** portended society's moral debasement,
thanks to its reduction of life to a fruitless quest to satisfy material
desires.20 Moreover, in the case of the life-philosophers' understanding
of the purely expressive nature of myth, he was in complete agreement,
even as he contested their assertion that myth presented a more
'authentic' mode of existence than that of reason.

In response to these twin crises, Cassirer offered the three volumes of
The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, and a series of later works, such as
The Myth of the State and The Logic of the Cultural Sciences. The
Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, in particular, can be seen as Cassirer's
attempt to provide, first, an answer to the crisis of self-knowledge
that he held responsible for many of the failings of modernity and,
second, to provide the general philosophical framework against which
truth claims could be tested. Through all of these works, Cassirer
continues to assert his fundamentally optimistic, liberal idealism. Here
we learn that [[humanity is **fundamentally a symbolic animal**;]{.mark}
it is the power to engage in the **process of meaning-creation** through
symbolisation that **separates humanity** from other animals. No other
creature has the power to **create abstract meanings** and **concepts**
in the manner that]{.underline}, for instance, [distinguishes humanity's
experience of time]{.underline} as a concrete past, present and future
[from the animal world's experience of pure immediacy]{.underline}.21

These works reflected Cassirer's need to balance the relationship
between the various symbolic forms, from the pure irrational
expressiveness of myth to the rationalist signification of natural
science.22 They allowed Cassirer to identify the significant fallacies
of both Liebensphilosophie and of the logical positivists, who had
narrowed the focus of philosophy to purely logical questions.23 For one
thing, [as a fundamentally symbolic animal, [**all human
meaning-creation**, even at its **most primeval** and **expressive** in
the form of **myth**, **requires mediation**]{.mark} [through the
process of **symbolic creation**.]{.mark} We **simply cannot recognise
anything as being meaningful** without the process of **conceptual
formation** that symbolisation involves]{.underline}. Therefore, [for
humanity, a world of pure immediacy **cannot exist**]{.underline}.24
Further, [those]{.underline} such as Simmel [who **despaired** of the
process of self-alienation]{.underline} of creator [from]{.underline}
object of [cultural creation **discounted the truly democratising
effects** of culture. It presented a realm in which **all could play
their part**, no matter **how small** it might prove to be. Rather than
see culture as a source of **alienation** and
**pessimism**]{.underline}, therefore, [[humanity needs to
recognise]{.mark} that [we are **all participants** in]{.mark} the
**dance of [cultural creation]{.mark}**[; it is **fundamental** to our
**very existence** as human beings and]{.mark} [is]{.mark} therefore
**[inescapable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.25

However, perhaps the most potent critique of life-philosophy was one
that Cassirer advanced only tenuously in the famous 1929 Davos debate
with the figure often presented as his philosophical nemesis, Martin
Heidegger. This critique can be effectively summarised in [a single
question: '**if not this**, **then what?**']{.underline} Cassirer
**[challenged]{.underline}** Heidegger's **[radical rejection of any
form of universality]{.underline}**, rooted in the latter's ontological
insistence of [the lonely finitude of]{.underline} Dasein---human
existence---and of [the nature of universality]{.underline} as the very
expression of inauthentic existence. Similarly, for Heidegger, the
temporal finitude of Dasein [**limited** all products of culture to the
same impermanence as human beings themselves]{.underline}. Pointing to
[the **fact of linguistic communication**]{.underline}, and by extension
to a situation in which he and Heidegger could conduct such a
conversation, Cassirer [**challenged** this assertion]{.underline}.
[That linguistic communication was **possible at all** pointed to the
**necessary existence of some forms of intersubjective universality**
that made human social life **possible**, and which were therefore
**key** to determining the **very nature** of our
existence]{.underline}.26 [This]{.underline} critique is potentially
highly illuminating. It [indicates one of the **core
reasons**]{.underline} why Cassirer accused Heidegger and Spengler, and
life-philosophy in general, of [**contributing**, however
**unintentionally**, to the **climate of fatalism** and
**pessimism**]{.underline} in German society [that afforded National
Socialism the opportunity to **occupy political** and **cultural
space**]{.underline}. In his **[extreme ontological
solipsism]{.underline}**, Heidegger [**undermined the possibility** of a
**common morality**, of a **shared**, **intersubjective criteria** for
assessing that which is **true** and that **otherwise**]{.underline}. If
this was Heidegger's intention, therefore, [with **what**]{.underline}
did he intend [to **replace** these things, other than a **Darwinistic**
'war of **all against all**'?]{.underline}27 [What then were the
**prospects for human civilisation** other than a **slide into the
abyss**?]{.underline}

[In]{.underline} their [cultivation of a **culture of
pessimism**]{.underline} in German life, their [[rejection of reason as
'**inauthentic**']{.underline}]{.mark}, their [[**purifying elision of
truth** in favour of the **expressive irrationalities of
myth**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and their consequent failure to stand up to
(and even, in Heidegger's case, the acceptance of) the violent mythical
fantasies of Nazism, many of the life-philosophers, and indeed the
German academy in general[, [stood accused of a **fundamental
dereliction** of]{.underline}]{.mark} [their philosophical duty in
warning of the dangers [Nazism]{.mark} presented to cultural
life]{.underline}.28 Moreover, in their active embrace of disenchantment
with Enlightenment ideals and its consequent pessimism concerning the
future, the life-philosophers and their followers forgot another of the
aphorisms of the Nietzsche they so venerated: that when you stare into
the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.

Political Myth, Philosophy and Pessimism in the Present

As when Cassirer was composing his later works, [our contemporary period
sees a liberal world order **threatening to collapse** under the weight
of its own contradictions]{.underline}. A combination of near-continuous
[economic and financial crisis, technological alienation, ecological
destruction, cultural and demographic shifts, disillusionment with and
distrust of]{.underline} the [institutions]{.underline} of liberal
democracy especially, [and]{.underline} soaring rates of wealth and
income [inequality have contributed to the irruption of **highly
anti-rationalist**, **reactionary populist movements** across the world.
Accompanying the rise of these movements has been the emergence of a
form of '**post-truth**' political discourse that **shows complete
indifference** to questions of truth or falsity]{.underline} and
exhibits many of the characteristics of the technique of the modern
political myth Cassirer articulated in 1945. None of [these
movements]{.underline} exhibit anything like the ambitions for global
conquest and genocide of the Nazis, but nevertheless they [reflect a
**profound**, **increasingly global**, **culture of pessimism** and
**political disenchantment** that portends **great uncertainty** with
respect to the future]{.underline}. Of particular concern to this
chapter is one of the fundamental questions that Cassirer posed in The
Myth of the State with respect to Heidegger and Spengler especially:
what has been the role of scholarship in precipitating this state of
affairs? This is a question that brings the problem of 'if not this,
then what?' to the very centre of critical analysis.

This question is of specific interest when considering the increasing
ubiquity of post-structuralist forms of critical inquiry in the social
science s. [Is]{.underline} perhaps [the cultural legacy of
post-structuralism the **exact opposite** of what post-structuralists
themselves actually intended?]{.underline} In short, [to what extent has
the post-structuralist determination to **problematise all forms of
ontological certainty**, of **fixed identity** and **secure foundations
to knowledge**, together with its often **aggressively anti-rationalist
rejection** of both liberalism and the Enlightenment (for all the
considerable flaws of both), actually become part of the **problem**, as
opposed to part of the **solution**?]{.underline}29

For example, [[the post-structuralist claim that there are **no
authoritative ontological claims** as to what is 'real', only a
**multiplicity of interpenetrating**]{.mark} [and **competing
interpretations**]{.mark} [of the nature of existence, historical events
a]{.mark}nd the social world is **seriously problematic**. Rather than
being a source of **political emancipation**, the bleak
post-structuralist assessment of modern political communities
contributes to a **profound sense of ontological disorientation**, not
least in its linkage of the absence of truth to the operations of
political violence in the form of power and the sovereign
state]{.underline}.30 Moreover, [it [leads to the **question** as to
whether such positions **fuel the quest for ontological certainty** that
often fuel the discourses of **reactionary populist political
myths**]{.mark}, not least in the form of some notion of the 'true' or
'authentic' community of 'the nation'. **Questions
remain**]{.underline}, therefore, [as to whether post-structuralism, for
all the **undoubtedly valuable work** it has done in
identifying]{.underline} cultural, political, ethnic, racial,
socioeconomic and other forms of (often [hidden]{.underline})
[exclusions and acts of oppression and violence, might not have ended up
doing **more harm than good** in terms of presenting **new forms of
political possibility**]{.underline} (which in the case of Foucault are
deemed impossible, anyway).31

[Rather than the **radical**, **liberatory** and **emancipatory
rethinking**]{.underline} of contemporary life and history its adherents
have [often claimed]{.underline}, this line of argument posits that
[post-structuralism has instead been **profoundly debilitating** to the
**remaking of political life** in a manner that might
address]{.underline} the many [issues]{.underline} of the relationship
between power and knowledge (especially in contemporary capitalism).
[Instead of leading to a **revolution in thinking** and a **rejuvenation
of political communities**]{.underline}, therefore, [post-structuralism
has served to inculcate a **deep current of solipsism**, **pessimism**,
**confusion** and **nihilistic cynicism**]{.underline} in both popular
and intellectual life [that has served to open a **considerable
political space** in which the **political myths of post-truth** have
been able to **thrive** in the absence of **any firm
counterweight**]{.underline}.32

These problems serve to bring us back to one of the fundamental
questions in Cassirer's philosophy that post-structuralism lacks an
answer to: how can a 'crisis in self-knowledge' and 'what counts as
truth' be addressed in an intellectual climate in which the possibility
of either has been obliterated? [In denying any ethical foundation to
knowledge, post-structuralism **denies any ethical foundation to
politics** and]{.underline}, in the process, [**negates** the
possibility of **holding to account** even the **most ludicrously
fantastical**, **outright fictional** and **frighteningly totalising
accounts** of political and historical events. This has proven
**profoundly destructive** to the ability to maintain the kind of
**pluralistic** and **respectful dialogue** necessary to the maintenance
of functional, accountable, transparent and deliberative democratic
politics]{.underline} advocated by Cassirer. [Such a politics **remains
the starting point for any kind of emancipatory process** focused on the
**delivery of social justice**, not least to those amongst the
**silenced**, **oppressed** and **marginalised**]{.underline}. However,
[it is **difficult to see** how such a politics is **possible** if it is
**not conceivable** to at least **agree dialogically** on a **set of
processes** through which claims to truth and knowledge can be
**verified**, **validated** and **accepted**. This ontological
dislocation begs the question as to **how**, and **on what grounds**,
individuals may **make rational** and **morally autonomous judgements**
in a polity in which the emotionally centred narratives of political
myths have become dominant]{.underline}. Faced with this problem, the
question of 'if not this, then what?' assumes a degree of importance
that has arguably never been more acute since the time of Cassirer
himself.

### AT: Calculation Bad

#### Calculative thinking key to prevent war\-\--conservatives coopt this approach

**Stanescu '14** \[James, January 7, Professional Lecturer in Philosophy
at American University, in Washington, D.C. Critical Animal,
"Abstraction, Calculative Thinking, Global Warming, and Environmental
Ethics; or the Polar Vortex of Thinking!,"
http://criticalanimal.blogspot.com/2014/01/abstraction-calculative-thinking-global.html\]

Moreover, **[[we will not be saved by virtue]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[infinite responsibility for the infinite other]{.mark}, or
voluntarism]{.underline}. [[What we need is]{.underline}]{.mark} better
abstractions, [**[more calculative thinking]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
**[more en-framing]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline} **[stronger
institutional responses]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As David Wood has shown,
[[when it comes to]{.mark} the [wars]{.mark} [in Iraq]{.mark} and
Afghanistan, Katrina, global warming, and a variety of other events, [it
has been the conservative response]{.mark} [to embrace]{.mark} the
[impossibility of calculative thought]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Perhaps [our project]{.mark} going further [is]{.mark}]{.underline} to,
as Isabelle Stengers has argued, **[[to calculate
again]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This is not the calculative thought of
the capitalist cost-benefit system, but a **different
calculation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is, to steal a phrase from Jane
Bennett, [[about **mutually enabling
instrumentalizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Long quotation from
Stengers ahead, so bear with me: The cosmopolitical Parliament is not
primarily a place where instantaneous decisions are made, but a
delocalized place. It exists every time a \"we\" is constructed that
does not identify with the identity of a solution but hesitates before a
problem. I associate this \"we\" with the only slogan Leibniz ever
proposed: Calculemus. [Let us calculate]{.underline}. It\'s an odd
expression, constructed to conceptualize the possibility of peace during
a time of war. But Leibniz was a mathematician, not an accountant or
statistician. For him, calculation was not a mere balance sheet
contrasting homogeneous quantities, calculations of interest or benefits
that were presented as being commensurable. For a mathematician, the
accuracy of a calculation and the validity of its result are relatively
simple questions, \"trivial\" in the language of mathematics. What is
important, and which is not in the least trivial, is the position of the
problem that will, possibly, allow it to be calculated, the precise
creation of relationships and constraints, the distinction between the
various ingredients, the exploration of the roles they are liable to
play, the determinations or indeterminations they engender or bring
about. There is no commensurability without the invention of a
measurement, and the challenge of Leibniz\'s calculemus is, precisely,
the creation of a \"we\" that excludes all external measures, all prior
agreements separating those who are entitled to \"enter\" into the
calculation and those subject to its result. \[\...\] Calculemus,
therefore, does not mean \"let us measure,\" \"let us add,\" \"let us
compare,\" but, first and foremost, let us create the \"we\" associated
with the nature and terms of the operation to be risked. It is not a
question of acting in the name of truth and justice, but of creating
commensurability. It is a question of knowing that the \"truth\" of the
created common measure will always be relative to what such creation
will have been capable of, knowing also that a radical heterogeneity
preexists such creation, the absence of any preexisting shared measure
among the ingredients to be articulated. (Cosmopolitics II, pp.
399-401).

#### Their definition of calculation is hopelessly broad\-\--it castigates all action targeted toward an end, like reading their aff to win, having a strategy they endorse

**Davison '1** \[Aidan; 2001; Geography and Environmental Studies at the
University of Tasmania; *Technology and the Contested Meanings of
Sustainability*, p. 132-136\]

[[We are cautioned]{.mark} by Heidegger [not to rush]{.mark} headlong
[into action]{.mark} aimed at solving an evident but. he assures
us]{.underline}, nonetheless [inessential problem such as the
destruction of a river valley]{.underline} through the construction of a
hydroelectric dam. [Heidegger insists that in our urgent hurry we will
miss the real threat]{.underline}, [which is not to the
valley]{.underline} or even its displaced human residents, [but to the
pos­sibilities for]{.underline} human [thinking]{.underline} itself.
[[Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} there can be no doubt that **[[our decision
to sit]{.mark} quietly [meditating]{.mark} on our breath or poetry
[involves]{.mark} many [difficult practi­cal choices. To sit
still]{.mark}]{.underline}** *in the* midst of the restlessness of the
technological world is as much‑indeed, [[is]{.mark} more‑ [deliberate
action]{.mark} than rushing out the door]{.underline} brandishing a
placard. [**[Simply sitting and reading]{.mark}** Heidegger
[implies]{.mark} a host of [practical judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
put aside books on integrated business management and be bothered with
Heideggers ontological questions at all runs counter to the
self‑assuredness and instrumentalism of the latemodern world. And
remain­ing open to these questions, if we choose to be so bothered, is
difficult amid the burly burly of technological life?r Contrary to
Dreyfus. [I consider]{.underline} that \"[ecological destruction,
inextricably **ontological and corporeal**]{.underline}.The literature
of radical ecophilosophy attests to this being so. My concern about the
accumulation of carcino­genic *pesticides* and heavy metals in the
tissues of my children is at once a concern with the technological
diminishment of human pocsibilities and a concern with the practical
task of living in more sane, more careful ways. Certainly [my
preoccupation with]{.underline} the [well‑being]{.underline} of my
children [could be nar­rowly construed as a mere instrumentalizing
concern with]{.underline} the [survival]{.underline} of my genes
Similarly ambivalent are alternatives to harmful, unsustainable
practices offered via the ecomodernist drive for ecoefficiency. If I can
afford them. I can choose from alternatives such as genetically
engineered pest resistance, the sub­stitution of timber in my house, and
of lead in petrol and paints, by more sophisticated synthetic products
of industrial laboratories. However, history has shown the propensity of
such solutions to create new sets of problems, for which new *sets* of
technological solutions are soon required. This is, after all, the
dynamic of technological profligacy that *defines* modernity There is
thus much weight to Dreyfus\' argument that to attempt to solve our
problems in this way is to move another step further clown the path to
fully technologized forms of life that obliterate the possibility of our
encountering our relational selfhood. But where does this leave us as we
negotiate the ambiguities of daily life? [[If I choose to reduce
toxicity]{.mark}]{.underline} in my family\'s diet by the collection of
rain water, by turning my backyard and local public land over to organic
forms of food production, by adopting simple passive design methods to
reduce the risk of termite damage, by cycling to avoid the combustion of
fuel, or by bartering for the vegetable‑based paints made by a neighbor,
[[am I necessarily falling prey to a]{.mark} death‑defying [desire for
control?]{.mark} Conversely, [are philosophers who spend]{.mark} **long
[hours]{.mark}** [meditating]{.mark}]{.underline} on Hólderlin or the
*term in* their everyday practices, [thereby [released from the]{.mark}
oppressive ontological [grasp of technology! I think
not]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Grammar Bad

#### Predictability via resolutional grammar is not anti-black, you can make arguments for why expert definitions should not be preferred and define one of the resolutional words using organic intellectualism but you didn't counter-define a word in this debate 

#### Grammar allows language and communication to be possible, it's necessary for all understanding

**Praise and Meenakshi, 14, Professors at VIT University** ( Samuel and
K. , "Importance of grammar in communication", International Journal of
Research Studies in Language Learning 2015 January, Volume 4 Number 1,
http://www.consortiacademia.org/index.php/ijrsll/article/view/789/365)

[[**The relationship between grammar to language** is not simply]{.mark}
a [regulatory]{.mark} device [but even]{.mark} something [more]{.mark}
than that]{.underline}. When [grammar is prioritized over communication
in the context of language, the term grammar is not used in the sense of
a textbook]{.underline}, or in the sense of anything as specific as a
set of rules of a language, such as gender, number, person, subject-verb
or object-verb agreement, word order, subordinating devices and so on.
[In generative grammar the set of such highly abstract principles is
called Universal grammar]{.underline}. [The nature of this grammar which
is the reality of language is not given but is to be
hypostatized]{.underline}. [Its reality is the fact that speakers have
an internal knowledge about it although they are unable to externalize
that knowledge. In this sense, then, language as it is known exists only
as an epiphenomenon]{.underline}, as used by Chomsky. [From such a
perspective, it is easy to see how **[grammar is the real thing and
language an appearance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus, what is called as
[[grammar]{.underline}]{.mark} in this abstract sense [[is]{.mark} to be
seen as [a set of boundary conditions under which language becomes
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within the boundaries however various
further possibilities exist, giving rise to a whole range of
multiplicities and variations. Internal choices are also responsible for
language change in course of time[. [Languages]{.mark} [change because
of many factors]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes accidentally but often
due to contact situations. [This is not denied when it is said that
'grammar' is a priori; for whatever roles these forces play, they do not
change the basic shape of language]{.underline}. Grammar is also the
pursuit of an activity as much the way Collingwood says what art is. In
trying to arrive at an understanding of any activity, one must begin
with a mass of experience related to that activity; and this experience
cannot be acquired by philosophical thinking, or by scientific
experiments, or by observation of the activity in other people, but only
by a long and specialized pursuit of activity itself. Only after this
experience has been acquired is it possible to reflect upon it and to
bring to light the principles underlying it (Collingwood, 1925, pp.
8-9). From this it is clear, that one cannot reflect on grammar without
actually doing grammar. These remarks of Collingwood, made in respect of
the philosophy of art, underscore the importance of doing something well
before venturing to talk about it, and that applies to the field of
grammar without doubt. It is liked to be said by us that doing grammar
and thinking about it are simultaneous and mutually supportive
activities. In the end of history, does each speaker decide his or her
own grammar? Many people believe that that is how it is going to be. If
so then grammar gradually loses its authenticity and we will have only a
naïve theory of language. But grammar has been continuously resisting
that end, and in that resistance, history too may have some hopes of
survival! 4. Different perspectives on competence According to Chomsky,
Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener,
in a completely homogeneous speech community, who knows language
perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions
as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest,
errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the
language in actual performance (Chomsky, 1965, p. 3). Chomsky clearly
distinguished the description of language form (competence) and language
use (performance) and established that the speaker-listener's internal
grammar that judges the grammaticality of sentences should be the main
object of investigation for linguists. ￼100 Consortia Academia
Publishing According to Dell Hymes communicative competence is
"appropriateness of sociocultural significance of utterance" (Canale &
Swain, 1980). Hymes (1974), retaining the idea of Chomsky's underlying
grammatical competence, looks at contextual relevance as one of the
crucial aspects of one's knowledge of language and claims that meaning
in communication is determined by its speech community and actual
communicative event in question, which consists of the following
components he calls SPEAKING (a mnemonic code word): Setting,
Participants, Ends, Act sequence, Key, Instrumentalities, Norms of
interaction and interpretation and Genre (Hymes, 1974). These are
broadly considered speech contexts in which real verbal interactions
takes place. 5. Conclusion From what has been read before it is realized
that without rules there is chaos. [Grammar is merely a set of rules to
preserve the written word]{.underline}. Without these standards there
would be no continuity of language and over time communication of ideas
would suffer. As people from different parts of the world try to talk in
English which is influenced by their own mother tongue, there are errors
in grammar and sentence pattern. [If one can master grammar, He or She
can unlock ideas and thoughts that were written across time and
place.]{.underline} [Proper grammar is very important. [Correct grammar
keeps from being misunderstood and lets us effectively express our
thoughts and ideas.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The way we
communicate]{.mark} is [extremely important]{.mark} in our profession
and society]{.underline}. While modern technology and social media have
less formal forms of communication, [we are expected to produce perfect
grammar in professional settings]{.underline}. Glaring errors in
spellings and punctuation are judged before the content of the work.
Grammar gives language users the control of expression and communication
in everyday life[. [Mastery over the words help]{.mark} speakers
[communicate]{.mark} their [emotions and purpose more
effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even though changes in grammar are
made from old to contemporary, grammar can change its shape according to
the trend but the importance or the role played by grammar still remains
the same]{.underline}.

### AT: "Truth is Violent"

#### "Truth bad" is a flagrant double-turn\-\--the entire aff makes "strong truth" claims

#### If they can describe their truth claims as contingent, so can we

#### Making truth claims is inevitable, vital to solve either team's impacts, and unrelated to "imposing" truths violently

**Eagleton '3** \[Terry; 2003; Distinguished Professor of English
Literature at Lancaster University; *After Theory*, Basic Books: New
York, NY, p. 105-9\]

[If it is true that a situation is racist, then it is absolutely true.
It is not just my opinion, or yours]{.underline}. But of course it may
not be true. [Or it may be partially true - in which case it absolutely
is partially true, as opposed to being completely true or not true at
all. [Defenders of]{.mark} **absolute [truth]{.mark}** [are not]{.mark}
necessarily **[dogmatists]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In any case,
[dogmatism does just not mean thumping the table with one hand and
clutching your opponent by the throat with the other]{.underline}. It
means refusing to give grounds for your beliefs, appealing instead
simply to authority. [There are plenty of courteous, soft-spoken
dogmatists]{.underline}. [[Holding something]{.mark} to be [absolutely
true does not mean]{.mark} affirming it against all conceivable evidence
and argument, and **[refusing]{.mark}** in any circumstances [to]{.mark}
[**concede**]{.mark} that [you are **mistaken**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Those who believe in absolute truth may]{.underline}]{.mark} [well
[be]{.mark} the kind of people who are [pathologically cautious about
**accepting anything as true**]{.mark} unless it seems **plainly
undeniable**]{.underline}. They may stumble through life in a haze of
scepticism and a miasma of doubt. [It is just]{.underline} that [when
they do]{.underline}, **[perhaps once every decade or so]{.underline}**,
[come grudgingly to accept a proposition such as 'The head gardener has
just shot himself through the foot' as true, they recognize that its
opposite cannot also be true]{.underline}, [and that its **being true
for them means** its being **true for everyone else as
well**.]{.underline} [Nor does 'absolutely true' mean true independently
of any context. We can only judge the world from within some kind of
framework]{.underline}. But this does not necessarily mean that what is
true from one viewpoint is false from another. [Elephants may be sacred
for you but not for me, if this represents a difference between our ways
of signifying them]{.underline}. **[But it cannot be true that elephants
really are sacred,]{.underline}** [in the same way that they really have
four legs]{.underline}, and that they are in the same sense not sacred.
[Cultures make sense of the world in different ways]{.underline}, [and
what some see as a fact others do not]{.underline}; **[but if truth
simply means truth-for-us]{.underline}**, **[then there can be no
conflict between us and other cultures]{.underline}**, since truth is
equally just truth-for-them. [This is tolerable enough when it comes to
the sacred status of elephants, as well as being extremely convenient
for us if we hold that forcing sexual relations on toddlers contributes
to their emotional well-being and psychological stability in later
years, and the culture next door does not]{.underline}. Since their view
is entirely relative to their own way of life, [it can naturally have no
effect on our behaviour.]{.underline} In any case, [if each cultural
framework constructs the world differently enough, it is hard to see how
they could share the same proposition in common. A different world
yields a different meaning. **Absolute truth has nothing to do with
fanaticism.**]{.underline} It does not necessarily mean the kind of
truth to which you are fervently committed. 'Erlangen is in Germany' is
absolutely true, but one would not go to one's death for it. [It is not
the kind of truth which sets the blood coursing and quickens the
heartbeat]{.underline}. **[It does not have the same emotional force as
'You strangled my great-aunt, you despicable bastard!]{.underline}**'
**[[Most absolute truths are pretty trivial]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Much
the same goes for the word 'absolute' when used in some moral discourse.
For Thomas Aquinas, '**[absolutely]{.underline}** wrong' [does not
necessarily mean '**very, very wrong'**]{.underline}. The word
'**[[absolute']{.mark} here [is not an
intensifier]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It just means 'shouldn't
be done under any circumstances']{.underline}. Aquinas thought rather
strangely that lying was absolutely wrong, but not killing; but he did
not of course believe that lying was always more grievous an offence
than killing. Being of reasonable intelligence, he appreciated well
enough that lying is sometimes pretty harmless. It was just that for him
it was absolutely wrong. **[[Absolute truth is not]{.mark} truth
[removed from time]{.mark} and change]{.underline}**. Things that are
true at one time can cease to be true at another, or new truths can
emerge. [The claim that some truth is absolute is a claim about what it
means to call something true, not a denial that there are different
truths at different times]{.underline}. [Absolute truth does not mean
non-historical truth: it does not mean the kind of truths which drop
from the sky]{.underline}, [or which are vouchsafed to us by some bogus
prophet from Utah]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[they are]{.mark}
truths which are [discovered by **argument, evidence, experiment,
investigation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A lot of what is taken
as]{.mark} (absolutely) [true]{.mark} at any given time [will]{.mark} no
doubt [turn out to be false]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Most apparently
watertight scientific hypotheses have turned out to be full of
holes]{.underline}**. [Not everything which is considered to be true is
actually true. But it remains the case that it cannot just be raining
from my viewpoint.]{.underline} Why does any of this matter? It matters,
for one thing, because it belongs to our dignity as moderately rational
creatures to know the truth. And that includes knowing the truth about
truth. It is best not to be deceived if we can possibly help it. But it
also matters because a ludicrous bugbear has been made of the word
\'absolute\' in this context; and because if the relativist is right,
then truth is emptied of much of its value. As Bernard Williams points
out, **[relativism is really a way of explaining away
conflict]{.underline}**.2 [If you maintain that democracy means everyone
being allowed to vote, while I maintain it means that only those people
may vote who have passed a set of fiendishly complicated intelligence
tests]{.underline}, [there]{.underline} [will always be **a liberal on
hand to claim that we are both right from our different points of
view**]{.underline}. [[If true loses its force]{.underline}, **[then
political radicals can stop talking]{.underline}** [as though it
is]{.underline} ]{.mark}[unequivocally [true that **women are
oppressed** or]{.mark} that [the **planet is being** ]{.mark}**gradually
[poisoned by corporate greed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They may still want
to insist that logic is a ruling-class conspiracy, but they cannot
logically expect anyone to believe them. The champions of Enlightenment
are right: truth indeed exists. But so are their counter-Enlightenment
critics: there is indeed truth, but it is monstrous.

### AT: Power

#### Power's argument is the opposite of the aff\-\--she's a [Marxist]{.underline} who thinks the government [should provide]{.underline} forms of social insurance through reforms, and thinks [some debates are good]{.underline}

**Power 13** (Nina, "What might a world without work look like?," The
Guardian, Proquest)

[[As with all major institutional entities]{.mark} -- law, prison,
education -- [to question]{.mark}]{.underline} work [[is to tamper with
reality]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. As with law, prison and education,
[[it is almost always]{.mark} \"[never a good time]{.mark}\" [to talk
about reform]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the abolition of existing
structures. [[The ideological mishmash]{.mark} represented by the word
itself [is]{.mark} **[worth examining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Paid
employment is an economic necessity for all but a tiny percentage of the
population, but \"work\" is tied up with miasmic qualities that touch on
social and even quasi-religious elements: identity, status, community,
habit, duty. Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial
news Read more The Tories, as ever, seek to exploit these complex
social, moral and economic factors in the crassest way possible. Just as
the \"big society\" sought to cynically exploit genuine fellow feeling
by turning social and cultural life into an unstable amalgam of
philanthropy and volunteering -- thus eliminating the role of state
provision -- the recent campaign opposing \"strivers\" to \"scroungers\"
and pledging to support \"workers not shirkers\" is an opportunistic
mobilisation of the residual idea that to work is to be a good person.
This idea, reinforced by TV shows (The Fairy Jobmother, for example),
implies that to be unemployed is a personal, moral failing, and that if
you just tried harder, got a haircut or on your bike, or changed your
attitude, employment would fall into your lap like a leaf dropped by a
benevolent Job-God. The reality of attempting to make work a moral,
personal issue, rather than a global, structural, economic one has
devastating consequences, not only on those who are unemployed or
precariously employed, but on those deemed \"fit to work\" when
manifestly they are not. [The [stripping of disability
benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} by Atos and the Department for Work and
Pensions did little to push those deemed fit to work into jobs, but
[[left many impoverished]{.mark} and suicidal]{.underline}. When work is
used as a moral stick to beat the population with, it is clear that the
imperative is less to actually employ people than to cut government
spending, with the bonus that the most vulnerable can be used as
political scapegoats. Campaigns against unpaid work as a condition of
receiving benefits -- workfare -- and [cuts affecting disabled people
have drawn out the truth behind government schemes]{.underline}. Boycott
Workfare and Disabled People Against Cuts, among others, have drawn
repeated and serious attention to the punitive nature of deeming people
fit for work, or attempting to place people in jobs when the jobs don\'t
exist or are unpaid. The value of labour as such -- from internships
across the creative industries and media to the pittance paid to factory
workers across the world -- is deliberately undermined by those who
profit from it, as it always has been. But as wages bear less and less
relation to the cost of living, it seems as good a time as any to ask if
the underlying fantasy is that employers will one day be able to pay
their workers nothing at all, because all those issues like housing,
food, clothing, childcare will somehow be dealt with in another,
mysterious, way. In the current state of the UK economy, as identified
by John Lanchester, the labour market looks very strange: The \"truly
weird and not at all understood fact is that this self-same economy has
been energetically producing jobs. In the quarter to October, in the
middle of this Stygian economic gloom, the British economy added 82,000
jobs. That\'s an all-time quarterly record. From the normal economic
perspective, this makes almost no sense.\" As Lanchester notes, these
jobs are part-time and low-paid; jobs with some security -- those in the
public sector where women dominate -- are being eliminated, for good if
the Tories have their way. Employment, presented as an all-encompassing
existential imperative, nevertheless exists less and less to provide a
living, let alone a life. But [[against this
backdrop]{.underline}]{.mark} -- rising inflation, increasing job
insecurity, geographically asymmetrical unemployment, attacks on the
working and non-working populations, and cuts to benefits -- **[[a
debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** about what work is and what it means
[**[has been taking]{.mark}** [place]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some
[[discussions at Occupy focused on]{.underline}]{.mark} what an
**[[anti-work]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or post-work)
**[[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** might mean, [[and]{.mark}
[campaigns]{.mark} not only [for a living wage]{.mark} but for a
guaranteed, non-means-tested \"citizen\'s income\"]{.underline} are
gathering pace. The chances of a scratchcard winning you a life without
work are of course miniscule, but as what [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
means to work becomes both more obscure and increasingly desperate, 2013
[[might be the perfect time to ask what work is]{.mark}, [what it
means]{.mark}, and what it might mean to live without it.]{.underline}
As Marx put it in his 1880 proposal for a workers\' inquiry: \"[[We
hope]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet ... with the support of all workers in
town and country who understand that [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} alone
[[can describe]{.underline}]{.mark} with full knowledge [[the
misfortunes from which they suffer]{.mark} and]{.underline} that only
[they]{.underline}, and not saviours sent by providence, can
[energetically apply]{.underline} the healing [remedies for the social
ills that they are prey to]{.underline}.\" In other words, [the best
place to start would be with]{.underline} those who have a relation to
[work]{.underline} as such -- which is to say nearly everyone, employed
or otherwise.

**[[We are removing this pamphlet as an act of solidarity with

Without Nina Power, I may never have broken into academia in the UK. She
supported me emotionally, financially, and professionally, in ways that
were sisterly and generous. These things -- friendship, trauma, and love
-- make it hard to divest of a person. Equally, for myself and many of
my peers, there is an overwhelming feeling of having failed both Power,
and 'the movement', now that it is clear that [former feminist activist

herself with violent]{.mark} 'edgelord]{.underline}'\[2\] **[[alt-right

**[[transphobes]{.underline}]{.mark}**\[4\], [and has definitively
divested herself of contemporary feminist thought]{.underline}\[5\]. I
do think [it is **important to clearly say**]{.underline} that right
now, [[Power should not be speaking **as a feminist in
public**]{.underline}]{.mark} (since she has clearly said she has no
allegiance to contemporary feminisms); [and to [interrogate the harm her
ideas are doing in academic]{.mark}, social, and political

writing this, had much to say about me, including: "Linda identifies as

**Hook, 21**---Associate Professor of Psychology at Duquesne University
(Derek, "Pilfered pleasure: on racism as "the theft of enjoyment","
*Lacan and Race: Racism, Identity, and Psychoanalytic Theory*, Chapter
2, pg 36-39)

[What is]{.underline} immediately **[striking]{.underline}** in these
extracts [is the role played by **affect**]{.underline}, or more
accurately yet, by [the]{.underline} "**[pained
stimulation]{.underline}**" [of]{.underline} the aroused passions of
**[enjoyment]{.underline}**. What both authors highlight---and this
speaks to the analytical value of the concept---is that forms of excess
stimulation (the "negative pleasure" of jouissance) underlie and propel
Symbolic and political constructions of otherness. Different cultural
modes of enjoyment are, furthermore, fundamentally discordant. [We
have]{.underline} then not so much a "Clash of Civilizations"---to
reference the Samuel Huntington's (1997) much cited thesis---as [a
**clash** of enjoyments]{.underline}. Moreover, [the difficulty that we
have in realizing]{.underline} "full"
[enjoyment]{.underline}---something that is impossible in Lacanian
theory for "castrated" speaking beings---[is dealt with by imagining the
**supposedly unimpaired** and **inevitably disturbing enjoyment**
possessed by]{.underline} cultural/racial/sexual
**[others]{.underline}**. In short, the fact that we cannot attain the
jouissance we feel we deserve results in perceptions of an unhindered,
illegitimate, and undeserved enjoyment on the part of others. As Sheldon
George notes: "the other's jouissance, or enjoyment, \[is\] ... the very
core around which ... otherness articulates itself" (2016: 3). Political
jealousy, as Žižek calls it, is thus (at least in part) the result of
incompatibilities and more importantly yet, perceived sacrifices of
jouissance. Jouissance: unserviceable tool of political analysis?
Despite having offered only a brief introduction to the above Lacanian
ideas, [[we should **pause**]{.underline}]{.mark} here for a moment [[to
voice a number of]{.underline}]{.mark} prospective [**methodological**
and **conceptual [problems]{.mark}** implied [by the racism
as]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[theft of]{.underline}**) [[**enjoyment**
thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Doing so will help us focus the expository
comments to follow, and indeed, to highlight the potential analytical
advantages the thesis may have to offer. The first critique, which
applies to a wide historical range of psychoanalytic theories of racism
(see Cohen, 2002; Frosh 1989; Stavrakis 1999), is that of psychological
reductionism. Simply put: [the [**complexity** of]{.mark} the various
**[historical]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[discursive]{.underline}**,
[and **socioeconomic causes**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of racism [are
**invariably deprioritized**]{.mark} and accorded a **peripheral
explanatory** role once [the]{.mark} domain of the [**psychological** is
**privileged**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Accounts]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
the psychological factors underlying various instances of racism
[are]{.mark} thus not only [**de-historicizing** and]{.mark}
**hopelessly [generalizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [they are also
**invariably depoliticizing**]{.underline}. A second critique: [[is
jouissance not]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[hopelessly
[open-ended]{.mark}]{.underline}** concept? [Virtually **any cultural
behaviour**]{.underline}, [**bodily intensity** or **[libidinal
activity]{.mark}** can]{.underline}, it seems, [be
considered]{.underline} to be [an instance of jouissance]{.underline}.
[In view of racism]{.underline}, for example, [the other's enjoyment can
[refer to **everything** from]{.mark}]{.underline} their
incomprehensible **[[cultur]{.mark}al customs]{.underline}** and/or
**[religious beliefs]{.underline}** (epitomized, for example, in odd
food and dress restrictions), [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} perceived
aspects of their distinctive
[physicality]{.underline}/[sensuality]{.underline} (their
**[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the way they
**[[dance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the sound of their
**[[music]{.underline}]{.mark}**), to attributions of superabundant
vitality (they are excessively promiscuous, religious, lazy, etc.)? [The
concept]{.underline} of jouissance [seems]{.underline} thus to be [both
**underdifferentiated** and **overly inclusive**]{.underline}, [applying
to a **potentially endless array** of behaviors and
experiences]{.underline}. [Without a **clearer sense** of how to
differentiate what **qualifies** as enjoyment and what does
**not**]{.underline}, [the concept **[loses analytical
value]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A third line of critique: [**different
modes** of enjoyment are implied]{.underline} within the literature,
[without being **properly distinguished**]{.underline}. In Žižek's
descriptions of racism and jouissance, for example, [jouissance is used
**broadly** to refer to]{.underline}: [**visceral** or **passionate**
modes of experience]{.underline} (the "thrill of
**[hate]{.underline}**"); an [array of **enviable
possessions**]{.underline} (our "**[libidinal treasures]{.underline}**")
perceived as under threat by cultural others; [and]{.underline} a type
of noxious "**[surplus vitality]{.underline}**" possessed by such
others. So, [whose enjoyment are we **most fundamentally concerned**
with]{.underline} in these notions of racism as jouissance, the other's,
or our own? What is the relationship between these two types of
jouissance? And how are they related to a third mode, namely the
"negative pleasure" of making---experiencing---such troubling
attributions in the first place? Fourth, there is ever-present problem
of [de-contextualization]{.underline} in "shorthand" applications of the
term. This [leads to a situation in which enjoyment]{.underline} itself
[is treated as a **causative force beyond adequate consideration**
of]{.underline} a series of accompanying concepts (the frame of fantasy,
the operation of the signifier, [the [role of]{.mark} the
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the "object a" as cause of desire) that
necessarily accompany its proper psychoanalytic application. What
[**auxiliary terms** [must]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[be
utilized]{.mark} alongside the concept if it is to serve us [as a
**viable**]{.mark} **analytical [tool]{.mark}**]{.underline}? Critique
1: the notion of enjoyment as psychologically reductionist There is a
crucial passage that is repeated in a number of Žižek's earlier books
(1992, 1993, 2005) and that serves as perhaps his most direct exposition
of racism as the theft of enjoyment: What is at stake in ethnic tensions
is always \[a kind of \] possession: the "other" wants to steal our
enjoyment (by ruining our "way of life") and/ or he has access to some
secret, perverse enjoyment. In short, what gets on our nerves, what
really bothers us about the "other" is the peculiar way he organizes his
enjoyment (the smell of his food, his "noisy" songs and dances, his
strange manners, his attitudes to work---in the racist perspective, the
"other" is either a workaholic stealing our jobs or an idler living on
our labour)" (1992: 165). While this seems, in many ways, a gripping
account, from a sociologist or historian's perspective[, the [degree of
reductionism is **staggering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The **[multiple
[complex]{.mark} sociological]{.underline}**,
**[economic]{.underline}**, [and **socio-historical [variables]{.mark}**
underlying distinctive historical forms of racism [are **brushed aside**
in favor of]{.mark} a **[generalizing psychoanalytic
formula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Racism = reaction to perception that
the]{.underline} (perversely enjoying) [other has stolen our
enjoyment]{.underline}. This reduction of racism to an affective
equation is evident also in Žižek's precursor in this conceptual domain,
Jacques-Alain Miller: Why does the Other remain Other? What is the cause
for our hatred of him, for our hatred of him in his very being? It is
hatred of the enjoyment in the Other. This would be the most general
formula for the modern racism we are witnessing today: a hatred of a
particular way the Other enjoys ... The question of tolerance or
intolerance is ... located on the level of tolerance or intolerance
toward the enjoyment of the Other, the Other who essentially steals my
own enjoyment (Miller, cited in Žižek 1993: 203). [The
**depoliticization**]{.underline} (indeed, the implicit
psychologization) [inherent in such a conceptual move is
**surprising**]{.underline} inasmuch it is something that Žižek has
proved critical of elsewhere. In a 1998 text, for example, Žižek
outlines the charge of psychological reductionism against standard
[psychoanalytic explanations of racism]{.underline}, which offer a way
of explaining racism that **[ignore]{.underline}** ... [not only
racism's **socioeconomic conditions** but the **sociosymbolic context**
of cultural values and identifications]{.underline} that generate
reactions to the experience of ethnic otherness (1988: 154). Surely this
also applies to the racism as theft of enjoyment formula outlined above?
[[Explanations]{.mark} of racism as jouissance are]{.underline} surely
[prone to **psychological reductionism**]{.underline} inasmuch as
[they]{.underline} often appear to [[privilege]{.mark} a series of
[psychoanalytic assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}
(**[drive]{.underline}**, **[fantasy]{.underline}**,
[**[libido]{.underline}**, **[projection]{.underline}**]{.mark}, etc.)
[as existing **prior** to]{.underline}---[or [**independently**
of]{.mark}]{.underline}---[considerations of
**[economic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[historical]{.underline}**,
**[political]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and **socio-symbolic
[context]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

**Singal '22** \[Jesse; 2022; science and culture journalist, described
as "America's best social science journalist," by Jonathan Heidt, former
science editor at New York Magazine; *The Quick Fix: Why Fad Psychology
Can't Cure Our Social Ills,* Farrar, Starr, and Giroux paperback
edition, p. 6-10\]

WHAT I SOON REALIZED is that [our society's fascination with psychology
has a dark side: many half-baked]{.underline}
[ideas]{.underline}---ideas that may not be 100 percent bunk but which
are severely overhyped---[are being **enthusiastically
spread**]{.underline}, [despite a lack of hard evidence in their
favor]{.underline}. The IAT is one example, but there are numerous
others. The popularity of these ideas, as well as the breathless manner
in which they are marketed by TED Talks and university press offices and
journalists and podcasts, is not harmless. [It misallocates resources to
overclaiming researchers when others are experiencing a
funding]{.underline} crunch, and it degrades the institution of
psychology by blurring the line between behavioral science and
behavioral pseudoscience.

Perhaps most important, these ideas are frequently being adopted by
schools, corporations, and nonprofits eager to embrace the Next Big
Thing to come out of the labs and lecture halls of Harvard or the
University of Pennsylvania. As the decision-makers who work in these
institutions have grown more fluent in science and cognizant of the need
to look to behavioral scientists for guidance (a good thing), they've
also become more susceptible to half-baked behavioral science (a bad
thing). And this explosion of interest in psychological science has
occurred at a time when, if anything, people should be more cautious
about embracing new and exciting psychological claims. As we'll see,
**[many findings in psychology]{.underline}**---including those featured
in introductory textbooks---**[are failing to replicate,]{.underline}**
[meaning that when researchers attempt to re-create them with new
experiments, they are coming up short. This so-called replication crisis
has cast a giant shadow over the entire field of
psychology]{.underline}, and the best available evidence suggests that
**[a sizable chunk of published psychological findings may be
false]{.underline}** (though the size of that chunk is a source of
heated debate). [Many psychologists themselves may be unwittingly
helping to promote half-baked science that seems to be built upon a
solid foundation of published research]{.underline}. In all likelihood,
we'll look back wincingly at some of the popular theories being taught
and developed today and, all too often, transformed into sleek
interventions that promise to alleviate our ills.\*

THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT to explain the allure of fad psychology, why
that allure is so strong, and how both **[individuals and institutions
can do a better job of resisting it]{.underline}**. [It is important to
improve our understanding of how behavioral scientific information
circulates in the public realm]{.underline}, [because **only sound
knowledge will earn us the improvements we wish for.**]{.underline}
[Just as we can't enact successful environmental and energy policies
while denying global warming, and we can't improve global public health
without taking a stand against anti-vaccination myths, we will never
**solve** the pressing social issues of the day]{.underline}---**[racism
and inequality]{.underline}** and the education gaps and so many
others---**[while relying on claims about human behavior and how to
change it that are half-true at best.]{.underline}**

[The spread of **half-baked** behavioral science can't be explained
apart from the present state of American political and intellectual
life.]{.underline} [The country has suffered from decades of rising
inequality paired with interminable political dysfunction, and as
institution after institution has seen its legitimacy
crumble]{.underline}, there's been an ever-intensifying focus on the
individual. We're living in what the Princeton historian Daniel Rodgers
calls an age of fracture, the title of his invaluable 2011 book.
"[Conceptions of human nature that]{.underline} in the post--World War
II era [had been thick with context, social circumstance, institutions,
and history gave way to conceptions of human nature that stressed
choice, agency, performance, and desire]{.underline}," he explains.
"Strong metaphors of society were supplanted by weaker ones. Imagined
collectivities shrank; [notions of structure and power thinned
out]{.underline}."3 In this dispensation, we are taken to be discrete
individuals floating around in markets, increasingly responsible for our
own well-being and increasingly cut off from the big groups and
institutions and shared ideas that gave American life so much of its
feeling and texture and meaning in the past. (Of course, many Americans,
by dint of their race or gender or religion or sexual orientation, would
not want to return to that past.)

Americans are also living with the consequences of what the political
scientist Jacob Hacker has termed "the great risk shift": as the
nation's social safety net has frayed and ever more risk has been
off-loaded from companies and the government onto overburdened
Americans, economic insecurity has crept higher and higher up the income
and wealth ladders. This only exacerbates the sense that everyone must
fiercely defend their gains and stand vigilant against the possibility
of sliding down into a less advantaged position. The combination of the
age of fracture with the great risk shift likely affects what sort of
behavioral science wins out in the marketplace of ideas: it likely
shifts the focus toward improving and optimizing and repairing
individuals rather than understanding how they are influenced by big,
roiling forces largely beyond their control.

[Within psychology]{.underline}, particularly social psychology[, these
tendencies have given rise to]{.underline} what I call Primeworld,4 a
**[worldview fixated on the idea that people's behavior is largely
driven]{.underline}**---and can be altered---**[by subtle
forces]{.underline}**. Central to Primeworld is, well, "primes," the
[unconscious influences that]{.underline}, [according to some
psychologists, affect our behavior in surprisingly powerful
ways]{.underline}: holding a warm drink makes people act more warmly
toward others, claims one finding, and being exposed to stimuli
connected to the elderly makes people walk slower, claims another. The
proponents of Primeworld suggest we can work toward "fixing" individuals
by helping them to understand the influence of primes and biases. [Their
accounts have three main characteristics]{.underline}: **[big, imposing
social structures and systems are invisible, unimportant, or improved
fairly easily]{.underline}**; primes and biases have an outsize
influence on societal outcomes; and these primes and biases can be
fixed, to tremendously salubrious effect, thanks to the interventions
offered by wise behavioral scientists.

This worldview treats complicated problems as though they can be
significantly ameliorated or solved with quick fixes: with cute,
cost-effective interventions by psychologists. Over and over, throughout
this book, we will see situations in which otherwise brilliant
researchers examining some of the most complicated problems known to
humankind have adopted the tenets of Primeworld. Whereas a social
scientist taking a broader view might look at a problem like "the
education gap" between white and black students and explain that it has
many complicated causes, ranging from segregated schools to early-life
experiences to the impact of tutoring, Primeworld adherents will take a
different tack. They will stress that a great deal of progress can be
made by optimizing the individual participants in the system, whether
students (perhaps via increasing their "grit," meaning their ability to
stick with difficult problems tenaciously) or teachers (perhaps via
IAT-based trainings).

The point is not that Primeworlders deny that there's a bigger world out
there, beyond primes and biases; if you asked them, they would quickly
acknowledge that yes, there is. The problem is that their work speaks
for itself, advancing a set of very specific, very zoomed-in priorities.
As a result of their evident excitement over exploring biases and primes
and the potential to optimize individuals, almost everything else fades
into the background, indistinct and all too easily ignored. But it is
increasingly clear that Primeworld simply hasn't delivered. Over and
over, it has been shown that the interventions its members favor simply
don't warrant the hype they generate, and there's strong reason to
believe that they fail because they neglect to attend to deeper, more
structural factors that are not easily remedied via psychological
interventions.

As this book will show, this does not mean we should give up on applied
behavioral science entirely. Psychology has produced some
ideas---particularly certain so-called nudges and interventions
targeting institutions rather than individuals---that have held up well
under scrutiny, and is likely to produce more as methodological reforms
take hold (which, as we will see, has already begun happening).

Still, there are good reasons to be wary of the styles of psychological
research that have seized public attention in recent years. And yet we
fall for quick-fix, half-baked behavioral science over and over again.

'Relief' must have said much more than it was bearable to say about the
capitalist stress position.

So then, you ask, [**how can we reroute shame** for making a better
social world]{.underline}. [Is turning a "shame on you" back on the
state effective for organizing not only social justice but an image of a
better state]{.underline}, better labor relations, [better
sociality]{.underline} amongst strangers [whose class and collective
interest is really not the same]{.underline}, really not ambitious to
produce the same better good life? [Partly I'm a pragmatist: whatever
works to interfere with the reproduction of mass injustice]{.underline},
in this case, the projection of the burden for revamping the cushion and
the net onto the people who need the cushion and the net, while the
wealthy hoard more of that for themselves. [But **I still think [the
battle to be]{.mark} thought through and [won is]{.mark} at the level of
[the imaginary]{.mark}**: to confront how powerfully **exceptional** the
neoliberal and democratic economic bubbles of the last 60 years
are]{.underline}, [**how expensive individualism is**, how the idea of a
mortgaged future needs to be confronted in its stark realities, how
entirely different models of collective dependence need to be forged in
relation to the reproduction of life because **there is no money** and
the poverty is both material and imaginary. I don't think it's about
converting shame, therefore, into pride or anything. I think [it
requires a hard confrontation with]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[a **very
difficult process**]{.mark} of changing what the]{.underline}
[**reproduction of life means** in both pragmatic and phantasmatic
terms]{.underline}. What this means will vary, but [its **impact on the
political** and on the **social relations of labour** will be
**astonishing**]{.underline}, because it has to happen: **[there will be
politics]{.underline}**, [and there will be **sacrifice**,]{.underline}
[and there will be a **chaos of wants** responded to badly and with a
bigger burden on the already vulnerable]{.underline} [**unless they
converge** to rethink their own investments in **inequality** and
**xenophobia**, the]{.underline} ready-to-hand fear formations. In Slow
Death6 I argue that [the long process of delegating **worse life and
earlier death** to the poor and hyper-exploited]{.underline} is now
becoming general through the population, such that mental health and
physical health are at war (as seen in the amount of alcoholism and
obesity rampant wherever a commodity culture reigns as the collective
scene for forging pleasure in a now beyond which there is no future) and
that mental health is winning (if what we mean is affective, appetitive
relief from exhausted sovereignty). [**[Can people bear to fight]{.mark}
themselves** [for better versions of the good life for everyone**? Or
are we now spiralling down the rabbit hole of liberal culture, where
people will only dig in and fight for the right to their individual
pleasure**]{.mark}]{.underline}?

### AT: Racial Battle Fatigue

#### There is no univocal black radical tradition\-\--some black people like traditional policy debate, and some don't. Allowing them to speak on behalf of all of them is paternalistic and encourages withdrawal from meaningful change. 

**Reed,** 12-27-**21**---Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the
University of Pennsylvania (Adolph, interviewed by Jason Myles and
Pascal Robert, "Adolph Reed Jr. on race reductionism and liberational
politics," <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvYcl7xkD70>,
1:14:05-1:19:22)

Well, **[[there is no Black community]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I mean,
not like that. Not [that comes **[fully formed]{.mark}** and **whole**
[with an interest]{.mark} that can be **imputed** or [that
**overrides**]{.mark} all the **[discrete interests]{.mark}** that are
at play]{.underline}. And I think this is one of the problems with
notions like Black freedom struggle and stuff like that, that there's [a
**[lack of]{.mark} historical [specificity]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[leads]{.underline}]{.mark} the [radicals [to]{.mark} posit the ideal
constituency at a level of [**abstraction** that doesn't]{.mark} help
you [connect with **actual**]{.mark} **people's actual
[concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

And [this is]{.underline}, I think, perfectly [demonstrated in how
radicals moved]{.underline} from generic Black Power radicalism and the
warrants, like putting Black faces in previously all-white places and
Black economic development stuff, [to construct]{.underline} these three
different variants of what I would argue are [the same **ontological
fantasy**]{.underline}. That's why it's called an ideology.
Pan-Africanism, culturalism, and the scientific socialism
[that]{.underline} the new communists embraced.

Because in each case, the move was to withdraw from -- And there was a
comparable thing going on in SDS too, by the way, or coming out of SDS
-- But to [**withdraw** from the plane of **mundane struggle** where
people's lives were played out]{.underline}. To go into the closet,
basically, or the sanctuary, and develop [some **abstraction** called
[an **ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that in each case [[was
understood to be]{.underline}]{.mark} like [[an **internally consistent
belief system**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Like a religion, basically. That's
what they all were. And [[the politics]{.mark} that was
warranted]{.underline} from each of these ideologies
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} in some way
**[[apocalyptic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So, [when people]{.underline}
used to [talk about shit like when the revolution comes]{.underline}.
Well, in the first place, **[[that's not the way stuff
works]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And granted, I was the last \[inaudible\]
so what the hell, right, because they weren't the only ones doing it.

So, what radicals saw was... We hit the streets like moonies, basically,
or Jehovah's Witnesses, or whoever the people are who go around and ring
your doorbell. And by the way, it used to work back in the day, a long
time ago, that when they rang your doorbell you'd just say, I'm
Catholic, and they'd run away like they'd just seen Satan. But that
apparently doesn't work anymore.

But anyway. So [what [political action was considered to be]{.mark} was
**[proselytizing]{.mark} the ideology**]{.underline}, [[not trying to
**organize around concrete programs**]{.mark} and **undertakings** that
would **make people's lives better**]{.underline}. And that brings us
back into the thin and abstract character of the symbols of new
radicalism. Like, you knew that you were a Panther because you had that
beret and that jacket. You knew you were a Nationalist because you had
the dashiki and a beard like Maulana Karenga, and you knew you were
Pan-Africanist because you dressed like a loser.

But [none of those had any **concrete content**]{.underline}. I know it
felt like it to the radicals. The [radicals felt that all this stuff was
**deeply meaningful**]{.underline}. But only to congregants in the
church and to competitors from those other two churches. And again,
[[bourgeois politicians]{.underline}]{.mark}, both the elected type and
the war on poverty type, or the rest of them, were able just to **[[take
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}** of that stuff [[because they had an
**institutional program** to offer]{.mark} people]{.underline}.

So, I think, yeah. I think it's correct that the [radicals **weren't
able to overcome** the]{.underline} class character or the class
[forces]{.underline} that were [shaping Black politics]{.underline}, but
they weren't able to overcome it [because they **never engaged** with
it]{.underline}. [Because part of the deal was **denying their
existence**]{.underline}. And see, that's when you get constructs like,
or odd notions of what class meant. It had more to do with behavioral
and consumption preferences than with... And see, this takes back to the
notion of racial authenticity as the basis for politics. Right?

#### Racial battle fatigue caused by things outside of debate, and even within zero reason ballot solves

#### Meliorism, or [pragmatic hope]{.underline}, better combats racial battle fatigue\-\--aiming for [proximate, possible goals]{.underline} solves their offense\-\--it's [uniquely true]{.underline} in the context of [refining demands]{.underline} over a series of debates

**Stitzlein '18** \[Sarah; 2018; Professor, University of Cincinnati
School of Education; Contemporary Pragmatis, "Hoping and Democracy,"

[What ought I hope for? This question guides]{.underline} our [pursuit
of the good life]{.underline} and its answer is often shaped by our
social, political, and educational experiences. [We aren't born
with]{.underline} ready-made [hopes]{.underline}; rather, [we shape them
through]{.underline} our [interactions]{.underline} with others, our
growing sense of what is possible as [we learn]{.underline} about our
environment, and [our experiments with the world to see what we can do
within it and to change it]{.underline}. Other [people play an important
role]{.underline} in this process, [especially through institutions like
schools]{.underline}, social arrangements like families, and political
practices like democracy. [They shape the traditions and
expectations]{.underline} we inherit, as well as the ways in which we
test, challenge, and revise what has been passed on to us. Despite this,
[hope is too often described in [individualist terms]{.mark} that
[**fail to encapsulate** the]{.mark} full [**process** of hoping and
its]{.mark} potential [impact]{.mark} on shared living]{.underline}.
[Many [**theologians** link hope with]{.mark}]{.underline} an
individual's [[faith]{.mark} in a deity]{.underline} who will act on his
or her behalf, 1 [some philosophers employ a **narrow understanding** of
hope as an individual's desire for an outcome in the face of
uncertainty]{.underline}, 2 while many more psychologists describe hope
as an individual's use of willpower and "waypower" to achieve clear
goals. 3 [Instead, I]{.underline} will [offer [a **pragmatist
account**]{.mark} of hope]{.underline}, which is [firmly [rooted
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
individuals [and [grows out of real]{.mark} life [circumstances]{.mark},
yet cannot be disconnected from social and political life]{.underline}.
4 I extend my account to show how [a pragmatist view of hope is
necessarily connected to other people and can]{.underline} be used to
[enrich our experiences in communities]{.underline}. Moreover, [such
hope can help us [to **better face**]{.mark} **current [political
struggles and social problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all the while
building a democratic identity together. 5 In this article, I will
explain how [pragmatism offers an enhanced understanding of
hope]{.underline} and its role in our lives together. To examine the
ways in which shared hoping and the shared content of our hopes shape
our identity and our work together in democracy, I consider both how and
what we hope. [Unlike]{.underline} other [accounts of hope that are
**largely divorced from life's circumstances**, such as **theological
accounts** that direct our attention to deities]{.underline} and
psychological accounts [that tell us we must hope for our goals
regardless of real world constraints]{.underline}, [pragmatist hope is
noteworthy because it is firmly rooted in reality]{.underline}. 6
Moreover, [[a pragmatist]{.mark} account [addresses]{.mark}]{.underline}
some of the [current [obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline} we face [in
American democracy [and is **capable of transforming**]{.mark} **or
improving** [them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps more importantly, [such
hope can be directly and indirectly cultivated within
citizens]{.underline}, thereby [offering a feasible way that democratic
life can be strengthened]{.underline}.

[1 Present Context]{.underline}

Before looking at hope in detail, let's briefly first take stock of
current conditions that relate to hopelessness in personal and political
life. In pragmatist spirit, the account I offer here must attend to real
conditions. Unfortunately, these are conditions where hope is
struggling, where democracy may be in jeopardy, and where the dominant
form of hope that we do see is largely privatized. To begin, a recent
study using the World Values Survey and other polling sources finds that
democratic [[citizens have "become]{.mark} more [cynical]{.mark} about
the value of democracy]{.underline} as a political system, [less hopeful
that anything they do might influence public policy, [and]{.mark} more
[willing to]{.mark} express **[support]{.mark} for [authoritarian
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 7 [[Those]{.mark} citizens
[have]{.mark} increasingly [**withdrawn** from democratic
participation]{.mark}, whether that be [through]{.mark} formal
institutions or alternatives in the [public]{.mark} or civic
[spheres]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as joining in movements or protests.
There has been a dramatic shift in how the wealthy view democracy, with
16 percent of them now believing that military rule is a better way of
living and an astounding 35 percent of rich young Americans holding such
a view. 8 There are likely many factors impacting this current state of
affairs and I will touch on a few here. 9 First, in terms of hope most
overtly, Alan Mittleman rightly notes that "[the legitimacy of politics
is damaged in proportion to its failure to fulfil the hopes it has
engendered]{.underline}." 10 Indeed, several recent American candidates
ran on messages of hope and yet the visions evoked have often failed to
be fulfilled in reality, crushing the heightened expectations of
citizens. [Politicians often use the rhetoric of hope, but they tend to
distort what hope really is and what it requires of
citizens]{.underline}, as I will explain later. Instead, they make
reference to the supposed destiny of the nation with God as its backer.
Or, as in the cases of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, some citizens
place their hope in the leader himself, invoking a messianic figure.
These forms of hope entail no more citizen action than, perhaps,
donating to a campaign or wearing an iconic t-shirt proclaiming "hope."
Instead, I will argue that, rather than passively relying on the hope
promised by politicians, citizens must participate in shaping and
fulfilling hope, making such hope more genuine and robust. Second,
[[structural violence]{.mark} and inequality, common amongst poor and
racial minority communities in America, [has wreaked havoc on
hope]{.mark}. In some cases]{.underline}, it has eroded hope. 11 In
others [[it]{.mark} has [rendered hope exhausting]{.mark}]{.underline},

hope]{.mark}** or perpetually chasing a vision of justice that
is]{.underline} (perhaps sometimes intentionally kept) [out of
reach]{.underline}. 13

**\[footnote 13 ends\]**

[[I]{.underline}]{.mark} intend to [[describe a]{.mark} form of [hope
that is]{.mark} more [**sustainable** and]{.mark} more [**attuned**
to]{.mark} the real [conditions]{.mark} of life that we can control and
others where we have limited control]{.underline}. Third,
[citizenship]{.underline} in America [has increasingly become centered
on individuals]{.underline}, personal responsibility, entrepreneurship,
and private success. [Historical accounts of rugged
individualism]{.underline} have now [joined forces with calls to educate
children in grit and expectations]{.underline} that one will fight [to
earn one's position]{.underline} and goods [in a competitive
marketplace]{.underline}. 14 [This environment lacks trust in others and
discourages collaborative effort. Often [those who]{.mark} have not been
successful]{.underline} in the past, or do not see viable avenues for
being so in the future, [**[fatalistically accept]{.mark}** these
[conditions]{.mark} and [become passive]{.mark} about countering or
changing them. While others who have enough resources and
power]{.underline} to be comfortable with the present conditions,
[indulge in the privilege of being cynical or apathetic. [Some
spread]{.mark} these [states of hopelessness]{.mark}]{.underline} or
jaded negativity [through memes]{.underline} and messages on social
media, [especially about the role and effectiveness of government,
**[rendering cynicism a collective practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 15
[Cynics, left believing that their political efforts are useless or
ineffective and perhaps that everyone acts on self-interest, are left to
look out merely for themselves, without a sense of responsibility to act
on behalf of themselves and others]{.underline}. Indeed, [cynics may
mock others who do not hold such views as naïve and out of touch with
reality. Cynicism functions as [a **distancing maneuver**, separating
citizens from]{.mark} each other, from formal [democratic
institutions]{.mark}, and from civic organizations, where visions of an
improved world and action to achieve it tend to occur. My notion of hope
aims to span those divides]{.underline}. Finally, [what is left of hope
has become **privatized**]{.underline}. 16 [This is exacerbated as
neoliberalism]{.underline} continues to assert Margaret [Thatcher's
claims, "There is no such thing as society, only individuals and
families," and "there is no alternative to the market." Hope is reduced
to a mere drive to achieve one's own limited dreams]{.underline}, or
those of one's children, typically only through financial terms and
material goods. When citizens are rendered isolated competitors, [[they
lose]{.mark} the [**ability to detect social problems** and]{.mark} the
[**motivation to ameliorate them**, especially if]{.mark} the
[effects]{.mark} on one's self]{.underline} or family [[are not
immediate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Economist Tyler Cowen describes these
citizens as [the new "complacent class,"]{.underline} who are
[content]{.underline} with the way things are as long as they are not
directly harmed and as long [as they can stay surrounded by people and
things that confirm their experience of the world]{.underline}. In their
complacency, the members of the complacent class are unable to "inspire
an electorate with any kind of strong positive visions, other than some
marginal adjustments." 17 I aim to show how hope is better understand as
a social and political endeavor that brings us into contact with others
as we craft visions of the future. In sum, [these [changes]{.mark} in
citizens' lives and views **[debilitate]{.mark} individual citizens and
[democracy]{.mark} as a whole**]{.underline}. [[They keep us
from]{.mark} recognizing and [solving]{.mark} collective [problems
and]{.mark} from [leading better lives]{.mark} together]{.underline}.
Citizens sit around waiting for reasons to hope, sometimes becoming
swept up in campaign rhetoric when election cycles come around, rather
than acknowledging that [hope is generated through action as subjects
working together]{.underline}, as I will argue. I will turn now to
depict a [pragmatist]{.underline} account of [hope]{.underline} that
[can be]{.underline} formally [cultivated in schools and]{.underline}
informally in [our lives together]{.underline}---a way of hoping
together [that may better support democratic life in these challenging
times.]{.underline}

[2 Pragmatist Hope]{.underline}

I offer here a pragmatist account of hope, largely based in the
philosophy of John Dewey. Notably, Dewey himself does not provide such
an account, even though hope underlies much of his work and was evident
in his own personal life as he encountered considerable despair at the
loss of two of his children and his wife, while also facing two world
wars. I construct a view of hope from Dewey's well-articulated elements
of inquiry, growth, truth, meliorism, and habits. [[Pragmatism]{.mark}
begins with the real and complicated conditions of our world. It [brings
together intelligent reflection with inquiry, habits, and action]{.mark}
so that we can understand and change our environments to better align
with our needs and desires]{.underline}. [Hope plays an important role
in that process]{.underline}.

[Inquiry, Growth, and Truth]{.underline}

For Dewey, [hope]{.underline} often [arises within the midst of despair,
when we have lost our way and are struggling to move
forward]{.underline}. [Dewey describes these moments as "indeterminate
situations."]{.underline} He turns to the process of inquiry via the
empirical method to help us explore those situations, consider possible
courses of action, and test out various solutions. It is inquiry that
helps us to understand, act upon, and reconstruct our environments and
our experiences so that we are able to move forward out of the
indeterminate situation. In a richly cognitive and often social
practice, [inquiry invokes curiosity and [problem solving to move us out
of ruts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[this]{.mark} method
**[combats]{.mark} the [stagnation of fatalism]{.mark}** [by urging us
to **formulate and try out solutions**]{.mark}. Growth describes how
reconstructions of our experiences through [inquiry develops]{.mark}
physical, [intellectual, and moral capacities]{.mark}, actualizing them
and helping them inform one another so that [they]{.mark} continue in a
chain that [enables one to **live satisfactorily**. We **grow**]{.mark}
when we learn from inquiry into indeterminate situations [and
**create**]{.mark} **ways to re-establish [smooth living]{.mark}** that
carries us from one activity to the next. [Many]{.mark} people
**[wrongly assume]{.mark}** that [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}
necessarily [[has an **end**]{.underline}]{.mark}---as if it were
"movement toward a fixed goal." 18 We tend to think of growth as only
progression toward some specific outcome, such as mastering bicycle
riding or graduating from high school. [But this way of thinking tends
to place the emphasis on the static terminus, [**rather** than focusing
on the **process**]{.mark} of growing [as **itself educative and
worthwhile**]{.mark}. Dewey's alternative view]{.underline} of growth
[does not neatly and linearly move toward a fixed goal.
Instead,]{.underline} he describes [[trajectories]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[are]{.mark} more [complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}, often
[shifting with the environment]{.underline}. Moreover, [holding onto a
fixed goal may be undesirable because doing so employs a limited or
possibly foreclosed vision of the future]{.underline}. Instead, [as
changes occur in one's environment]{.underline}, Dewey asserts that
[people must continually inquire into moments of uncertainty and
changing circumstances, develop new hypotheses about those situations,
and revise their aims]{.underline}. Dewey works with what he calls
["ends-in-view," which are relatively close and feasible, even if
difficult to achieve, rather than overarching goals at some final
endpoint in the future]{.underline}. Those ends-in-view guide our
decisions and hypotheses along the way, [keeping us resourceful in the
present]{.underline}. In Dewey's words, the discovery of how things do
occur makes it possible to conceive of their happening at will, and
gives us a start on selecting and combining the conditions, the means,
[to command their happening]{.underline}...[there must be a realistic
study of actual conditions and the mode or law of natural
event]{.underline}, in order [to give the imagined or ideal object
definite form and solid substance]{.underline}---to give it, in short,
[practicality and constitute it as a working end]{.underline}. 19 For
Dewey, [[ends and means]{.mark} are intelligently [considered in **light
of each other**]{.mark}, with [both]{.mark} being
**[revisable]{.mark}**, and [neither **abstracted**]{.mark} from the
other. Each fulfilled end-in-view sustains our hope by highlighting
meaningful headway and directing our further action]{.underline}.
[Ends-in-view later become means to future ends, working in an ongoing
continuum. [This]{.mark} **sustenance of hope** [differs from
theological accounts which are **difficult to sustain**]{.mark} on faith
alone [and]{.mark} may [leave believers **frustrated**]{.mark} at an
apparent lack of action or improvement]{.underline}. It also differs
from positive psychology and grit literature which tends to focus on
large, far-off, and challenging goals that one holds tenaciously. [Many
people think of hope as goal-directed and future-oriented. While objects
of hope for pragmatists may temporarily serve as ends-in-view, the
practice of hope moves us forward through inquiry and experimentation as
we pursue our complicated trajectory]{.underline}. [It helps to unify
our past, present, and future. [Hope]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [is
[not]{.mark} just about a vision of the future, but rather [a way of
living in the present]{.mark} that is [informed by the past and what
is]{.mark} anticipated [to come]{.mark}. Whereas [utopian views]{.mark}
of what could be [may]{.mark} actually immobilize one and may [exhaust
one]{.mark} in the present, **[pragmatist hope is always tied to what
one is]{.mark} doing [and feasibly can do]{.mark} in the present**,
especially when equipped with knowledge of the past]{.underline}.
Central to pragmatist philosophy, [ideas become true insofar as they
"work" for us, fruitfully combine our experiences, and lead us to
further experiences that satisfy our needs]{.underline}. [Pragmatists
are concerned with the concrete differences in our lived experiences
that an idea's being true will make. Pragmatic truth expresses "the
successful completing of a worthwhile leading."]{.underline} 20 Unlike
truth as a corresponding match between proposition and reality,
[pragmatist truth]{.underline} is something that [occurs when the goals
of human flourishing are satisfied]{.underline}, at least temporarily.
Built into these criteria is consideration of the well-being of others,
for successful leading through experiences almost always necessarily
requires working and communicating with others. Additionally, the
differences an idea will make are quite limited, and therefore less
truthful, if relevant only to one person. While not a comprehensive
vision of the good life, [certain norms including equality and just
communication are entailed both in these deliberations and the
determination of truth]{.underline}. 21 We must consider how to flourish
alongside others as we craft our ends-in-view. This differs considerably
from other philosophical and psychological accounts of hope based on the
desire of objects or states of affairs regardless of whether they are
good for us or other people.

[Meliorism]{.underline}

#### Political organizing isn't labor draining, its energy producing

**Loewe '12** \[B; October 15; an organizer and communicator, has served
as NDLON\'s Communications Director, supported the Alto Arizona work
against SB 1070 and Sheriff Arpaio, and participated in the organizing
of the 2010 US Social Forum in Detroit; Organizing Upgrade, "An End to
Self Care,"
http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/blogs/b-loewe/item/729-end-to-self-care\]

[As long as [self-care]{.mark} is discussed as an individual
responsibility and additional task, it will be something that
middle-class people]{.underline} with leisure time [will most easily
relate to and [will include **barriers** to]{.mark} the lives of [people
**without time to spare**]{.mark}. [It becomes]{.mark} one more
unchecked box on a to-do list to feel bad about, an unreal expectation,
or [a **far-off dream**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **movement is my self-care** not my reason for needing
it]{.underline}.

> [Don Andres awoke every morning at 5:00am]{.underline} to arrive at a
> street corner [to look for work]{.underline} by 6:00am. [He'd work a
> full day]{.underline} of heavy construction [and still arrive at the
> 7:00pm meeting]{.underline}. He'd routinely fall asleep but he was

> to band together, [[was the **only option** for how care could be
> **anything but alien**]{.mark} in his life as a day laborer. Being at

[[Lack of care is **systemic**]{.mark}. Therefore resistance to those
systems is the highest affirmation of care for oneself and one's
community. **[Movement work is healing]{.mark}**]{.underline} work.

[What self-care often misses is the reality that for the majority of
people engaged in social justice movements, participation is out of
**necessity**]{.underline}. That [a **[collective
effort]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the form of social movement [[is the
**highest articulation** of **caring for one's own self**]{.mark} in a
world designed to deny your worthiness of care. Too many people
discussing [self-care **overlook** the **structural barriers** that make
**access** to the care]{.mark} they are speaking of [impossible]{.mark}
without the struggle they often discuss as the cause of their need to
'take care of themselves.']{.underline}

Even for someone like myself who has the majority of my materials needs
met, I feel most alive, most on fire, most able to go around the clock,
when I'm doing political work that feels authentic, feels like it pushes
the bounds of authority, and feels like it is directly connected to
advancing my individual and our collective liberation.

The truth is that [we cannot knit our way to revolution]{.underline}.
The issue is not that movements are taxing, because truly they are.
[It's called 'struggle' for a reason]{.underline}. But they go from
strain to overtaxing when we seek to fulfill our political aspirations
through vehicles never meant to carry them like in non-political
formations or some 501c3s.

[[The crisis of care is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a **crisis of
organization**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Non-profits are built to do a lot
of good, but they have inherent limitations that mean they are rarely
built to fulfill our visions of the transformative organizing that would
usher in a world where we could feel whole. [Most engaged in social
movements]{.underline} today [are originally driven out of either a

#### Studies confirm\-\--it combats burnout and racial battle fatigue

**Reid '18** \[Caroline; 2018; "Activism as a Source of Strength for
Black College Students at Predominately White Institutions,"
https://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1588&context=honors_theses\]

Racism is deeply ingrained in American society, and white supremacy and
the oppression of people of color has greatly contributed to the
establishment of the very institutions that continue to perpetuate its
existence today. Racism manifests itself in a variety of ways, and its
most constant and daily appearance is in instances of microaggressions.
These experiences contribute to feelings of invisibility, frustration,
and anger, an experience known as racism- related stress, which research
has shown to severely and negatively impact mental health. In order to
combat the insidious effects of racism, Black Americans have utilized
coping mechanisms for generations. [This [resiliency is]{.mark}
astoundingly [powerful]{.mark}, however, dealing with the omnipresence
of racism is a constant and significant internal labor. [For]{.mark}
Black college [students]{.mark} at predominately white institutions,
[microaggresions]{.mark} and systemic racism [create a difficult
environment to navigate]{.mark}. **Unique [opportunities in activism
manifest]{.mark}** themselves **[as tools to combat]{.mark}**
discrimination and **[racism-related stress]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, some argue that caution is needed in viewing activism as
panacea for improving the lives of people of color, particularly Black
people. Indeed, some research has suggested that activism is harmful to
mental health, as it increases the intensity and frequency of
experiences of perceived racism among some populations. [This thesis
includes a **[meta-analysis]{.mark}** that [examines]{.mark} the
findings on the [effects of activism on mental health]{.mark}. As a
result of this analysis, a counter argument [argues the potential
of]{.mark} the [**utilization of activism** as a source of
strength]{.mark} that may [combat the harms of racism]{.mark},
supporting the earlier claim that certain factors involved in activism
may be protective in nature]{.underline}.

Results As Table 1 shows, the Moderate Hope group had a slightly higher
proportion of younger people whereas the High Hope group had slightly
higher proportion of older people. Across all three levels of hope, at
least a third of the participants had a high school diploma. Among High,
Moderate, and Low Hope individuals, about 50%, 43%, 33% had at least
some college experience or was a college graduate, respectively. [While
categories of annual household income were distributed rather evenly
among the High and Moderate Hope groups, **approximately [half of the
people in Low Hope group had an annual household income of less
\$30,000]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Over 40% in the High Hope group were
married. Approximately 34% and 32% of Moderate and Low Hope individuals,
respectively, were married. Table 4 presents the relationship among age,
income, education, racial microaggressions, and societal problems. We
found that age and educational level significantly affected MEES. After
controlling for age, **[[annual household income]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
educational level, and racial microaggressions (b = 0.327, β = 0.258, p
\< 0.01) and societal problems (b = 1.199, β = 0.346, p \< 0.01) still
[**[significantly affected]{.underline}** [MEES]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the High Hope group. [[Racial microaggressions accounted for
**6.4%**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the variation in MEES]{.underline},
[[while **societal problems**]{.mark} accounted for
**[11.9]{.mark}%.**]{.underline} However, when we looked at the group of
African American males with Moderate Hope, we found that societal
problems was not significant. Only racial microaggressions (b = 0.382, β
= 0.317, p \< 0.01) significantly predicted MEES in this group after
controlling for demographic characteristics. The variations in MEES
accounted for by racial microaggressions were 9.8%, a nd the variations
accounted for by societal problems were 3.4%. Among African American
males in the Low Hope group, the results indicated that none of the
factors (i.e., ag e, annual household income, educational level, racial
microaggressions, and societal problems) have any significant influence
in MEES. Racial microaggressions and societal proble ms were no longer
significant, and they only explained 3.4% and 0.5% of the variance in
MEES, respectively. Altogether, age, annual household income,
educational level, racial microaggressions, and societ al problems
accounted for 24.3% of the total variation in MEES in the High Hope
group, 27.7% in the Moderate Hope group, and 6.8% in the Low Hope group.

Hope appears to play a different role for the African American men in
this study when compared to previous research. [Race-related
socialization appears to influence how much **[hope is healthy]{.mark}**
or realistic]{.underline} (Bowman & Howard, 1985; Brown, 2008; Fischer &
Shaw, 1999; Neblett, Philip, Cogburn, & Sellers, 2006). African American
men with high to moderate levels of hope had more stress associated with
racial microaggressions and societal problems than did men who had low
hope. Like similar findings in the study by Danoff-Burg, Prelow, and
Swenson (2004), we are encouraged from our findings that hope works
differently for African American men. **[Hope appears to be [correlated
with]{.mark} a more [realistic assessment of]{.mark} the possibilities
of [experiences]{.mark} that African American men might
face.]{.underline}** [Possessing a more [realistic]{.mark} understanding
of the potential for racist discrimination [offers]{.mark} these men
additional [avenues for coping]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Hope does not
always have to be based in reality.]{.underline} Therefore, [by having a
more accurate understanding of racial microaggressions and societal
problems, these men learn to avoid extremely harmful external control
behaviors]{.underline} that can destroy typical or mainstream avenues
for reaching their goals. It should be clear that [[we are not
suggesting]{.mark} that African American men with low or moderate levels
of hope are playing into [a negative self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline} or that they are not reaching their
expected goals. However, we are suggesting that **[low and moderate hope
men are taking into account additional realities that their high hope
peers appear to overlook and]{.underline}** therefore they **[are
struggling with more self-reported stressors.]{.underline}** Under these
circumstances, the opening quote from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
is still appropriate in the present lives of African American men.
Moreover, in our study, [to be an African American man is to hope
against hope that racial microaggressions, societal problems, and racial
battle fatigue will diminish in the near future.]{.underline} Thus, [we
agree]{.underline} with Stevenson (1997), [African American men must
possess]{.underline} three [important forms of racial socialization as
forms of coping]{.underline}: proactive, protective, and adaptive. [In
our study, it appears that **[adaptive racial socialization]{.mark}**
might be [play]{.mark}ing [a significant role]{.mark} in [reducing
stress among low hope African American men]{.mark}. Adaptive racial
socialization is [an **orientation** that **recognizes**
]{.mark}]{.underline}the [racial microaggressions and [**racist
discrimination**]{.mark} that pervades, [**identifies it**,]{.mark} and
then **keeps it at bay** long enough [to develop]{.mark} room for
creative [counterstrategies]{.mark} (Stevenson, 1997). Consequently,
high hope African American men, who tend to be slightly more formally
educated, older, hold full-time jobs, higher incomes, and who married in
greater numbers, are more at-risk from the relative safety that adaptive
racial socialization provides. Maintaining or developing adaptive racial
socialization strategies can enhance African American men's belief in a
world that is obfuscated with racists relations while promoting healthy
self-development despite the obstacles they face (Stevenson,
1997).]{.underline}

Pedagogical games are used to challenge our assumptions about how the
world works (Waldner & Kinney, 1999). For example, the basic assumption
of competitive games is fairness. This assumes that the world is fair
(i.e., a meritocracy) and that individual effort or talent is the main
factor in success (i.e., an ideology of individualism akin to Ross'
(1977) fundamental attribution error). In competitive games therefore,
groups are treated equally and the best players win. But [[a pedagogical
game may challenge]{.mark} the assumption of [fairness **directly** by
having structural inequality **built into the
game**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The experience of a good player losing an
unfair game creates cognitive dissonance---that cognitive dissonance is
our teaching moment. I assume that students as game players can easily
identify games that are "unfair" based on unequal outcomes for
equivalent behavior. As a peda- gogical tool, [I want it to
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively [[easy for them to **spot the
explicit rules** which cause the inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### It's a unique case turn - the risk of extinguishing the game comes from strategic imbalances. Fairness is all that matters. Attempts to restore creativity by breaking rules fail. This turns every aspect of the case because their own anarchic impulses are actually strategic efforts to control and close down the open space of debate. That formal condition supercedes their content

**Armstrong 2k** (Paul B. Armstrong is Professor of English and Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. "The Politics of Play: The Social Implications of Iser\'s
Aesthetic Theory," New Literary History 31.1 (2000) 211-223

. [\"Play\" is an aesthetic as well as an anthropological
phenomenon]{.underline} of special interest to Iser because it is a
particularly pervasive, useful, and revealing manifestation of doubling.
In his vocabulary, [play is not just a formal category but a general
term for how differences engage one another. The basic structure of play
is oscillation, or to-and-fro movement]{.underline}, a notion Iser
borrows from his teacher Gadamer: If we examine how the word \"play\" is
used and concentrate on its so-called metaphorical senses, we find talk
of the play of light, the play of the waves, the play of gears or parts
of machinery, the interplay of limbs, the play of forces, the play of
gnats, even a play on words. In each case what is intended is to-and-fro
movement that is not tied to any goal that would bring it to an end; . .
. rather, it renews itself in constant repetition. The movement backward
and forward is obviously so central to the definition of play that it
makes no difference who or what performs this movement. . . . It is the
game that is played\--it is irrelevant whether or not there is a subject
who plays it. The play is the occurrence of the movement as such. 4
[Play is not a subjective attitude or exclusively an aspect of the
aesthetic experience but a potentially **never-ending, ever
self-renewing movement** to and fro.]{.underline} [Play sometimes shows
itself in games that have a particular goal]{.underline}\--the victory
of one side or the determination of a single result\--[but this
\"instrumental play\"]{.underline} (as Iser calls it) [only achieves its
end by]{.underline} \[End Page 215\] [stopping play (]{.underline}the
game is over). By contrast, \"free play has to play against endings\"
(FI 237) and seeks to keep the back-and-forth of play in motion. In
practice, [free play is an idealization that can only be abstracted from
the different ways games are played under specific conditions, with
particular rules, toward determinate ends.]{.underline} As Iser
explains, \"the endlessness of play has to be conveyed by playing
through specific possibilities, and this is done by means of games\" (FI
257). [Games are characterized by a \"contraflow of free and
instrumental play\"]{.underline} (FI 247) that can take various forms.
Games combine free and instrumental play according to different ratios.
Keeping the to-and-fro in motion and aiming to establish a particular
result are in a sense two aspects of play which may contradict each
other, but they also depend on each other. On the one hand, **[[no game
can be purely instrumental without ceasing to be playful and becoming
merely a means to an end]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On the other hand,
there is an instrumental quality to free play itself to the extent that
each move back-and-forth is an attempt to establish meaning and decide
the outcome. [Even in instrumental games, however, [no move has its
meaning intrinsic to itself, but depends on a reply and a result it
cannot entirely control: \"every game begins with a move whose
consequences can never be totally foreseen\"]{.mark} (]{.underline}FI
261). [The element of free play in all games is that no move is complete
but always depends on what it is not, a future it has not yet
reached.]{.underline} \"Free play\" and \"instrumental play\" are
opposites that are deeply and profoundly linked to one another. The four
categories of games, which Iser borrows from Roger Caillois\--agon,
alea, mimicry, and ilinx\--show how free and instrumental play may
combine to make games more open-ended or more directed toward finality.
5 As Iser explains, \"the endlessness and the finality of play\" are
\"two countervailing tendencies\" (FI 264) that can interact differently
in various kinds of games. [Although agon (games of contest or struggle)
and alea (where chance rules) are both defined by the ends of winning
and losing, their valence may change in textual games.]{.underline}
There \"**[alea plays against agon, whose antithetical arrangement
reduces the element of chance, whereas [alea explodes\" oppositions that
seek to control or structure meaning and limit the play of
accident]{.mark}]{.underline}** (FI 261). \"[If agon aims to overcome
the difference that arises out of antagonistically arranged positions,
alea aims to intensify it, thereby making it into a rift that cannot be
overcome]{.underline}, and reducing all play to mere chance\" (FI 261).
[Textual games where conflict seeks resolution in the triumph of one
position are countered by **strategies aimed at opening up the
possibility of unforeseeable, uncontainable consequences**]{.underline}.
If there are already elements of both free and instrumental play in
games of conflict and of chance, then the counterflow between
endlessness and finality becomes \[End Page 216\] even more complicated
and contradictory when the different kinds of games combine. Iser
describes mimicry as a game tending toward closure because it promotes
\"the forgetting of difference\" (FI 262) between the copy and the
original and opposes disruptions that might undermine the illusion of
reality. [But the element of free play in imitation\'s pursuit of
verisimilitude is exposed by ilinx, the game of subverting all fixed
positions in order to induce vertigo. This \"carnivalization of all the
positions assembled in the text\"]{.underline} (FI 262) [exposes the
boundlessness and multiplicity of possible illusions given the
ultimately ineradicable difference between the fictive and the
real]{.underline}: \"Ilinx may therefore be seen as a game in which free
play is at its most expansive. But for all its efforts to reach beyond
what is, free play remains bound to what it overshoots, because it can
never quite extinguish the undercurrents and overtones of instrumental
play\" (FI 262). Even the subversion of roles in the interests of
opening up meaning depends on instrumentally directed ends for it to
undermine. Its liberating aims are significant only against the backdrop
of the games of finality it undercuts. Free play and instrumental play
are inextricably intertwined in the games texts play as they range
between open-endedness and closure. According to Iser, \"[the text game
is one in which limitation and endlessness can be played to an equal
degree]{.underline}\" (FI 265). On the one hand, \"because of their
forms, games must inevitably be limited; in contrast with play, they are
designed for endings. The result ends play\" (FI 265). Even with the
most anarchic, disruptive, open-ended text, \"the endlessness of play
cannot be maintained, since the text itself is limited\" (FI 257). On
the other hand, [in contrast to \"result-oriented games]{.underline},
especially mathematical, [strategic, and economic ones]{.underline}, as
well as those of chance and skill, [all of which are designed to remove
existing play spaces,\" a text can take as its game the multiplication
of opportunities for play, whether by \"play\[ing\] against each other\"
the various games it includes or by demonstrating that they can be
played without end]{.underline}, so that the \"game is not ended by
itself but by its player\" (FI 265, 266). [**Although
some**]{.underline} determinate or [**[didactic texts may aim to close
off play in the interests of the results they desire, it is possible to
play the games of even these texts in ways that keep open and expand
their potentiality for meaning]{.mark}**. [Even the most instrumental
text can]{.mark}, because it is a text, be [read in ways that open it up
to meanings and purposes it cannot limit (]{.mark}offering its games up
for observation as games]{.underline}, for example, rather than
submitting oneself to their ends[, or engaging them with other modes of
instrumental play governed by different notions of finality).
Paradoxically, although all texts have limits because they are finite
ways of playing particular games, the only ultimate limit on their
capacity to]{.underline} \[End Page 217\] [mean is the resourcefulness
and energy of the player (or the history of readers) in keeping their
play in motion]{.underline}. Because of these contradictions, textual
games are especially illuminating models of the anthropological and
social functions of play. [Iser\'s exploration of the paradoxes of play
is important not only as a clarification of the games of texts but also
as an explanation of the usefulness of play as a particular way of
deploying power.]{.underline} Both the endless to-and-fro of free play
and the result-oriented moves of instrumental play entail the use of
power. But [the opposition of free and instrumental play distinguishes
helpfully between ways power may be employed.]{.underline} In contrast
to the widespread contemporary assumption that power aims only and
always for dominance, [the aim of instrumental play, to]{.underline}
achieve victory and [end the game by determining the result, contrasts
with the uses of power for expanding the potential for meaning,
which]{.underline} the to-and-fro motion of [free play makes
possible.]{.underline} The element of potential open-endedness in
instrumental play suggests that even the use of power for masterful ends
is not monolithic but contains a counter-movement onto which the
subversive counterflow of free play can cathect. The need that free play
has for limits and aims offers a critique of the dream of innocence of
open-ended play without finality, but [**[the disclosure of the playful
element of instrumental games opens up the possibility that power can be
used without the inevitability of coercion or violence.]{.mark}** The
mutually illuminating interaction of free and instrumental
play]{.underline} in textual games [can be seen as a model for the
ethical use of power. Guided by such an ethics, instrumental play would
become ironic about its ends by recognizing their limits and
contingency. Such an ethics would also instruct instrumental uses of
force that the achievement of their aims can be ironically
self-defeating by putting an end to the game]{.underline} that had
defined them. But such an ethics would also inform free play that its
subversive, anarchic advocacy of an endless to-and-fro is empty without
the forms and aims that give play meaning. The will to infinite
expansion of free play would be countered by an ironic awareness of its
inability to sustain itself without the other it opposes. [The
counterflow of free and instrumental play informing **[such an ethics
would have the aim of preventing any one game from dominating all the
others in the interests of keeping the space of play open]{.mark}**. It
would seek to have **rival games engage each other** with the
recognition that their conflicts do not simply **frustrate the will to
dominance** of each but can be mutually enhancing because opposing modes
of play typically depend on and benefit from one another. The play-space
opened up by such an ethics would be **a democratic community of often
incommensurable games**]{.underline} \[End Page 218\] **[whose principle
of interaction is not indifferent tolerance of the other but ironic and
energetic engagement with difference]{.underline}**. 6 An [[Iserian
ethics of play would seek **reciprocity but not
consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This can be seen in the role of
doubling in fictional play. Play is central to fictionality because, as
a structure that doubles worlds, meanings, and forms against one
another, the fictional is characterized by \"[the coexistence of the
mutually exclusive]{.underline}\" (FI 79). This \"coexistence of the
mutually exclusive\" can be seen in the doubling of the fictive world
and the real (from which it selects and combines its materials), [in the
kaleidoscopic multiplication of]{.underline} perspectives in a text
(which may refuse to coalesce), in the interaction of [opposing games
(which pursue incompatible ends)]{.underline}, or in the juxtaposition
of the reader\'s experiential horizon with the worlds opened up by the
text. In each case there is reciprocity between the doubled parties in
that meaning is generated not by either pole on its own but by the
to-and-fro between them. This doubling need not lead to resolution in
order to be productive. The playful interaction of differences acquires
energy and creativity from the resistance of doubled pairs to coalescing
in a final synthesis. If and when unity is achieved, the play of
doubling ends. [The to-and-fro of play resists consensus because it
depends on difference to keep it in motion, even as it requires
reciprocity between the parties it engages so that the back-and-forth is
not halted by violence]{.underline} or a lack of response. The doubling
of play suggests that [**social and linguistic relations can be
productive even if\--or precisely because\--they do not end in
agreement**. An important lesson of play is that **difference need not
issue in either solipsistic disconnection or violent discord if it can
be staged as reciprocal exchange**]{.underline}. The doubling of play
shows that [**consensus is not necessary for reciprocity.**
Prior]{.underline} or final [agreement is not required for meaningful
exchanges to take place if conditions facilitating the to-and-fro of
play between differences can be maintained]{.underline}. By the same
token, [reciprocity between opposing partners in an exchange need not
thwart their ability to make and invent moves in the games through which
they pursue their interests and aims.]{.underline} Indeed, [opposing
games often need one another more than they realize, and they can find
their differences from one another mutually beneficial if conditions of
playful doubling allow meaningful exchanges to occur.]{.underline}
**[The ideal polis of play would be a community of difference based on
nonconsensual reciprocity. The politics of play would entail the pursuit
of this ideal.]{.underline}** Such a politics offers an important
response to the alternatives widely thought to represent the primary
options available for addressing the challenges of difference. [An ideal
of play based on nonconsensual reciprocity opposes Habermas\'s notion
that cultural oppositions constitute]{.underline} \[End Page 219\] [a
condition of fragmentation that should be overcome b]{.underline}y
noncoercive, cooperative negotiation guided by the goal of
[agreement]{.underline}. 7 Iser\'s explication of the values of doubling
suggests that [Habermas errs in assuming that consensus is an implicit
ideal of language that successful communicative action undistorted by
force aims to bring about. Differences]{.underline} may not be the
result of a splitting off of faculties in the interests of
specialization, but [may reflect irreconcilable oppositions between
games based on mutually incompatible rules, assumptions, and
aims.]{.underline} Habermas\'s goal of establishing conditions of
undistorted communication where no force rules other than the force of
the better argument may still be valuable. But its value arises not
because agreement about the \"better argument\" will result from
uncoerced exchanges or even because power can ever be banished from such
interactions (as the contradiction in the formula \"no force other than
. . .\" implicitly recognizes). Rather, as an attempt to establish
conditions of reciprocity that rule out violent intervention to decide
the to-and-fro of an exchange, Habermas\'s model of uncoerced
negotiation would facilitate play in Iser\'s sense of a potentially
ever-renewing doubling of positions which resist synthesis or
unification. The counterflow of various forms of play that Iser
describes would help to establish and maintain such exchanges not by
banishing force\--an impossible dream\--but by setting up interactions
between opposing assertions of power that would counter each other\'s
will to dominance. [A [play-space of reciprocally interacting positions
offers an alternative to the model of consensus as an image of how
communication undistorted by violence might enable differences to engage
one another. Such a play-space also **opposes the notion that the only
alternative to the coerciveness of consensus must be to
advocate**]{.mark}]{.underline} the sublime powers of
[**[rule-breaking]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 8 Iser shares Lyotard\'s
concern that [to privilege harmony and agreement in a world of
heterogeneous language games is to limit their play and to inhibit
semantic innovation and the creation of new games]{.underline}.
Lyotard\'s endorsement of the \"sublime\"\--the pursuit of the
\"unpresentable\" by rebelling against restrictions, defying norms, and
smashing the limits of existing paradigms\--is undermined by
contradictions, however, which Iser\'s explication of play recognizes
and addresses. The paradox of the unpresentable, as Lyotard
acknowledges, is that it can only be manifested through a game of
representation. The sublime is, consequently, in Iser\'s sense, an
instance of doubling. [[If violating norms creates new games, this
crossing of boundaries depends on and carries in its wake the
conventions and structures it oversteps]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
sublime may be uncompromising, asocial, and unwilling to be bound by
limits, but its pursuit of what is not contained in any order or system
makes it dependent on the forms it opposes. \[End Page 220\] [[The
radical presumption of the sublime is not only terroristic in refusing
to recognize the claims of other games whose rules it declines to limit
itself by. **It is also naive and self-destructive** in its impossible
imagining that it can do without the others it
oppose]{.mark}s]{.underline}. As a structure of doubling, [[the sublime
pursuit of the unpresentable requires a play-space that includes other,
less radical games with which it can interact]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such
conditions of exchange would be provided by the nonconsensual
reciprocity of Iserian play. [Iser\'s notion of play offers a way of
conceptualizing power which acknowledges the necessity and force of
disciplinary constraints without seeing them as unequivocally coercive
and determining. The contradictory combination of restriction and
openness in how play deploys power is evident in Iser\'s analysis of
**\"regulatory\" and \"aleatory\" rules**.]{.underline} Even the
[regulatory rules]{.underline}, which [set down the conditions
participants submit to in order to play a game]{.underline}, \"permit a
certain range of combinations while also establishing a code of possible
play. . . . Since [these rules limit the text game without producing it,
they are regulatory but not prescriptive. They do no more than set the
aleatory in motion]{.underline}, [and the aleatory rule differs from the
regulatory in that it has no code of its own\"]{.underline} (FI 273).
[Submitting]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the discipline of [regulatory
restrictions is both constraining and enabling because it makes possible
certain kinds of interaction that the rules cannot completely predict or
prescribe in advance]{.underline}. Hence **[the existence of aleatory
rules that are not codified as part of the game itself but are the
variable customs, procedures, and practices for playing
it.]{.underline}** Expert facility with aleatory rules marks the
difference, for example, between someone who just knows the rules of a
game and another who really knows how to play it. [**Aleatory rules are
more flexible and open-ended** and more susceptible to variation than
regulatory rules, but they too are characterized by a contradictory
combination of constraint and possibility, limitation and
unpredictability, discipline and spontaneity. As a rule-governed but
open-ended activity, play provides a model for deploying power in a
nonrepressive manner that makes creativity and innovation possible not
in spite of disciplinary constraints but because of them.]{.underline}
Not all power is playful, of course, and **[some restrictions are more
coercive than enabling.]{.underline}** But thinking about the power of
constraints on the model of rules governing play helps to explain the
paradox that restrictions can be productive rather than merely
repressive. Seeing constraints as structures for establishing a
play-space and as guides for practices of exchange within it envisions
power not necessarily and always as a force to be resisted in the
interests of freedom; it allows imagining the potential for power to
become a constructive social energy that can animate games of to-and-fro
exchange between participants whose possibilities for self-discovery and
self-expansion are \[End Page 221\] enhanced by the limits shaping their
interactions. Whether the one or the other of these possibilities
prevails in any particular situation is not intrinsic to the structure
of power; it depends, rather, on how games are played. Iser summarizes
much of his thinking about literature, play, and human being in his
notion of \"staging.\" According to Iser, \"staging is the indefatigable
attempt to confront ourselves with ourselves, which can be done only by
playing ourselves\" (FI 303): \"Staging in literature makes conceivable
the extraordinary plasticity of human beings, who, precisely because
they do not seem to have a determinable nature, can expand into an
almost unlimited range of culture-bound patternings. The impossibility
of being present to ourselves becomes our possibility to play ourselves
out to a fullness that knows no bounds. . . . If the plasticity of human
nature allows, through its multiple culture-bound patternings, limitless
human self-cultivation, literature becomes a panorama of what is
possible\" (FI 297). The ultimate political value of literature lies not
so much in the content of any particular representation as in its laying
bare for observation and analysis the power of human plasticity to stage
itself in ever-changing cultural forms. As a demonstration of how play
can facilitate the productive doubling of mutually exclusive forms of
life, literature also offers a model for how the differences through
which human plasticity stages itself can beneficially interact. If
\"only by being staged can human beings be linked with\" one another (FI
303), then [playful nonconsensual reciprocity is a political form of
life particularly conducive to enacting socially useful relations of
difference. Iserian [play has political implications because it would
allow decentered human beings to produce and exchange versions of
themselves in a kaleidoscopic social world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[For some on the left, it has become conventional to celebrate, if not
cultivate, pluralism, whether this means multiple forms of being or
multiple interpretive possibilities with regard to texts. It has also
become conventional to be critical of "sovereignty" and of
"law]{.underline}." [[Multiplicity is thought to be a threat to
sovereignty,]{.mark} and this threat is thought to be democratizing or a
force [that resists oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Italian
philosopher Giorgio Agamben exemplifies [these
[tendencies]{.mark}]{.underline} within contemporary political and legal
theory. In some of his earlier and less well-known work, he aspires
toward a "coming community" that he calls "whatever being." Whatever
being [e[mbrace]{.mark}]{.underline}s [the [infinite communicative
possibilities of language as pure means beyond a preoccupation with true
or false]{.mark} propositions]{.underline}.∂ In his best-known work,
Agamben links sovereignty to the production of rightless subjects and
the Nazi death camps. He urges us to rethink the very ontological basis
of politics in the West, creating a human being beyond sovereignty or
law, in order to avoid perilous outcomes. One key to surpassing the
logic of sovereignty, according to Agamben, is whatever being\'s
positive relation to the singularities of life and the multiplicities of
communication.∂ Whatever being is also being outside of law. If "law"
persists in this "coming community," it would be a "law" that has become
deactivated and deposed from its prior purposes. "Law" will have become
an object for play -- something to be toyed with the way that children
might come upon a disused object and play with it by putting it to uses
disconnected from whatever purpose this object might once have had.∂
[Why does the fact of playful communicative possibilities lead to either
more democracy or a less brutal world? [The most conservative]{.mark}
United States [Supreme Court justices]{.mark} have recently [embraced
the fact]{.mark} that [texts are open to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[multiple
interpretations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For example]{.underline}, Samuel
[[Alito]{.mark} has [suggested]{.mark} that the meaning of [public
monuments is open to multiple interpretations that]{.mark}]{.underline}
may [shift]{.underline} over time [to [avoid a]{.mark} potential First
Amendment establishment clause [problem over a monument of]{.mark} the
[Ten Commandments in a public park]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}1 Yet,
as the late Justice Blackmun has written regarding state endorsement of
religion, "government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons
are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some."2
[[Recognizing]{.mark} the possibility of [multiple
interpretations]{.mark}]{.underline}, as this instance shows, [[does not
lead]{.mark} necessarily [to]{.mark} outcomes friendly to
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}.∂ In this essay, I investigate how
playing with the [[multiplicity of communicative possibilities
can]{.underline}]{.mark}, contrary to Agamben\'s expectations, [actually
[**facilitate** aspirations for unitary sovereign
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. My argument unfolds in the context of the
legal arguments put forward by Bush administration lawyer John Yoo,
[particularly those [enabling torturous
interrogations]{.mark}]{.underline}.∂ [[Those]{.underline}]{.mark}, like
Agamben, [[who favor interpretive pluralism]{.mark}]{.underline} in
itself [[rarely]{.underline}]{.mark}, if ever, [[have right-wing
supporters of unchecked presidentialism in mind.]{.mark} Reading the
scholarship and legal memoranda of]{.underline} John [Yoo]{.underline},
formerly [in the Bush administration\'s Office of Legal
Counsel]{.underline} (OLC) and presently a University of California,
Berkeley law professor, however, [approaches an experience of pure
mediality or of law that has become deposed or disconnected from its
purposes. [Yoo is]{.mark} well known as [the author of]{.mark} the [key
legal memoranda asserting]{.mark} the president\'s [discretionary power
to make war,]{.mark} to [engage in]{.mark} warrantless [surveillance,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}, most infamously, [justifying
[tortur]{.mark}ous methods of interrogation]{.underline}. Some scholars
refer to Lewis Carroll\'s Alice in Wonderland to describe the experience
of reading Yoo\'s legal memos.3 [Is John Yoo an exemplar of]{.underline}
the whatever being and [pure mediality]{.underline} that Agamben
describes and [to which]{.underline} he contends [politics should
aspire?∂]{.underline} In this paper, I describe how [[Yoo gestures
toward]{.mark} pure [mediality]{.mark}]{.underline}, as he indicates the
experience of language itself as pure communicability or as pure means
in his legal work [[when he emphasizes]{.mark} the [openness of law
to]{.mark} being exposed to [new]{.mark}, different, [flexible]{.mark},
or plural interpretive [possibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. I argue,
however, that Yoo is not well described as whatever being. His work
repeats too consistently in the direction of absolute presidential
decisionism to be open to whatever.∂ Instead, [Yoo\'s work may capture a
broader development within our society]{.underline} that Agamben
describes as the emergence of whatever being. Without saying that there
has been no resistance to the Bush administration\'s warrantless
wiretapping and policies of torturous interrogations, the contrast
between the response to the Nixon administration and the Bush
administration is striking. Richard Nixon resigned one step ahead of
impeachment in the midst of mass protests against his presidency. The
articles of impeachment, for instance, addressed how Nixon engaged in
warrantless wiretapping, and refused to execute laws passed by Congress
faithfully while repeatedly engaging in conduct that violated the
constitutional rights of citizens. Congress also passed major acts of
legislation to prevent a president such as Nixon from ever again abusing
power the way he had. These laws include the War Powers Act of 1973, the
Budget Impoundment and Control Act of 1974, and the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.∂ In contrast, almost [no one seems to
have noticed that]{.underline} the [Bush]{.underline} administration
[claimed power to make war at the president\'s sole
discretion.]{.underline} Additionally, upon learning that the Bush
administration engaged in criminal acts of surveillance, Congress
amended FISA in the summer of 2008 to expand the government\'s power to
spy on Americans, while immunizing from legal accountability non-state
actors who collaborated with the then-criminal acts of government
officials who followed Bush\'s illegal orders. [Congress tried to make
it impossible for those detained to question]{.underline}, legally,
[their detention]{.underline} or to bring the torturous treatment they
endured to a court\'s attention, while allowing the intelligence
agencies to continue to engage in torturous acts by passing the Military
Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). This [complicity]{.underline} on the part
of Congress [cannot be explained on partisan grounds as many Democrats
voted in favor of the MCA]{.underline}, and upon becoming the majority
party in Congress, they have not rescinded it. Indeed, [it was a
Democratic-controlled Congress that brushed the Bush administration\'s
illegal surveillance under the rug in 2008]{.underline}.4 Moreover, upon
taking power in 2006, the Democratic leadership immediately stated that
they would not pursue impeachment. [Former Reagan]{.underline}
administration [Department of Justice lawyer Bruce Fein has decried the
lack of outrage at the Bush administration\'s illegalities by suggesting
that the nation has become a collection of constitutional
"illiterates]{.underline}."5 Perhaps **[[law is being
deposed]{.underline}]{.mark}** as Agamben suggests.∂ Both Agamben\'s and
Fein\'s [[observations]{.mark} may also [indicate]{.mark} a [failure
of]{.mark}]{.underline} what Michel Foucault would call [[disciplinary
power]{.underline} --]{.mark} the power to constitute subjects capable
of exercising power, here the powers of liberal democracy -- a failure
that Gilles Deleuze has identified with the emergence of societies of
control, and a subjective and ontological diversity that Michael Hardt
and Antonio Negri call the "multitude."6 [[They]{.mark} also [indicate
practices of textual "interpretation]{.mark}" where interpretative acts
extricate legal texts from the narratives [that once oriented]{.mark}
their [purposes and animated these texts for a republican and
anti-monarchical polity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Robert Cover
argues, however, that law is part of a narrative practice constitutive
of subjects and a way of life.7 [Insofar as interpretive practices
become extricated from]{.underline} the possibility of
[narrative]{.underline}, then, [we may indeed doubt the continuing
existence of "law,"]{.underline} as Agamben posits. Psychoanalytic
theory also identifies a loss of a structuring meaning in contemporary
society and describes this as the decline of symbolic efficiency.8∂ [In
sum, there appears to be a phenomenon emerging in contemporary society
that a variety of different theoretical and political perspectives are
struggling to grasp and evaluate]{.underline}. While Agamben welcomes
the failures of disciplinary powers as enabling the emergence of
whatever being and the "coming community," [it is a cause for concern
among those seeking to keep the faith with republicanism, with liberal
democracy, or with a Constitution]{.underline} representing these
aspirations. In this light, we can be more specific than Agamben about
the kind of threat that whatever being poses to the state or to
sovereignty.

Here is where we can dramatically contrast Derrida\'s and Fitzpatrick\'s
attention to law with Agamben\'s aversion to the concept of
responsibility because of its relation to the juridical (Agamben 2002:
20ff.; Mills 2008: 102-4). If one is motivated by justice, if one wants
to give force to the requirements of justice or make the powerful more
just, then one must calculate, with a spirit of justice, what decision
to make.9 One cannot simply maintain the point of suspense. Not if one
wants to prevent the awful possibility of camps. Therefore, the
experience of passivity, this [openness to innumerable
possibilities]{.underline} described by Agamben, [is like the infinite
responsiveness required by considerations of justice in the suspended
moment prior to a legal decision]{.underline}. To leave matters at this
suspended point is consistent with Agamben \'s antijuridicism, since
responsiveness is only one dimension of the law; pure receptivity would
be vacuous and ultimately nothing. [The [demands of justice]{.mark},
however, [mean]{.mark} that [we **must** make a
determination]{.mark}]{.underline} [-]{.mark} one that admittedly will
come too late. Consequently, [[to leave matters at a moment
of]{.mark}]{.underline} passivity or [[receptivity]{.underline}]{.mark},
as Agamben does with his embrace of pure potentiality, [[is to do
neither law nor]{.mark} the work of [justice]{.mark}. The [categories of
ontology]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.mark} themselves [[do not enable us
to address the most pressing injustices in]{.mark} contemporary [law and
politics]{.mark} today, [such as]{.mark} the [revival of
camps]{.mark}]{.underline}. To translate our terms of political theory
into the terminology of ontology, as the new ontologists do, leads to
significant confusions. [[To **embrace**]{.underline}]{.mark} pure,
**[[infinite]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or unthinkable [[**possibilities**
for their own sake gives us **no normative grounds on which to resist
camps**. To contend]{.mark} that [the opposite of sovereignty is
contingency]{.mark} or potentiality [does not suggest another
force]{.mark} or capacity [of greater normative value than
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Furthermore, if pure
sovereignty is \'determinant\', for example, then it cannot be described
ontologically as \'absolute necessity\'. Absolute democracy, exterior to
sovereignty, is also an impossibility. 10 [[In
contrast]{.underline}]{.mark} to Agamben, though, [[let us give credit
to]{.mark} the [achievements of]{.mark} the [people]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
the [centuries of struggle against the tyranny of absolute
monarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and consider the quest for popular
sovereignty. [Democracy is already an articulated concept]{.underline} -
an articulation of demos or people, and kratos (or kratein), [which
refers to having power, the force of law, rule, or to have or to be
right]{.underline} (Derrida 2005: 22). That is, \'democracy\' itself
refers to popular sovereignty, a situation where people are sovereign,
or where people govern themselves. [In a democracy, people give
themselves laws, and share power equally.]{.underline} By referring to
popular sovereignty, I emphasize the normative element of democracy: it
is right that the people should rule, the people have a right to rule.
This is the rule or law of democracy. A new beginning is always both
less and more than democratic. A new beginning must borrow its terms.
Likewise for a democratic beginning: the people of popular sovereignty
do not invent the language of their self governance out of nothing.
Indeed, [the [possibility of democracy is **given by language**,
and]{.mark} the many [discourses of democracy, with **meanings
attributed** to]{.mark} these [words, **rules of grammar**, and
discourses]{.mark} that the people did not give to themselves. The
[beginning of democracy cannot be absolutely democratic]{.mark}. When we
begin]{.underline} - even a project of democracy - [[we begin from
a]{.underline}]{.mark} place or a [[position]{.underline}]{.mark}
already given to, or **[[imposed]{.underline}]{.mark}** upon, us
(Derrida 2000, 2002b) . Our beginnings are always less than democratic
as they have been legislated in advance of us. Additionally, [[because
we must borrow our terms]{.mark}, the \'people\' of popular sovereignty
are always more than themselves. The \'people\' of popular sovereignty
share their power with others who preceded them]{.underline}.
Furthermore, democratic acts are oriented to the future, to keeping
democracy that is, they are oriented towards future incarnations of
democratic subjects. Moreover, because democracy opens itself to others,
the \'anyone\' of democratic participation may include those who lack a
commitment to democracy. Therefore, the \'people\' of democracy are
always more than themselves. There is never just democracy here. There
is always democracy plus something else. [The \'people\' of popular
sovereignty are also always less than themselves. Never fully present,
and defying origins, democracy reaches out to others in order to be.
These others are past and future. Because we must begin somewhere, on
some haunted grounds, using terms the meaning of which has, to some
extent, been previously determined by others, democratic beginnings are
always less than democratic]{.underline}. Concrete democratic acts are
necessary to fulfil promises or claims for democracy. But, like
considerations regarding justice, there is always a limit to our
knowledge, or a finite limit to our accounting of a problem, or our
memory. In these ways, [[democracy is always
lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is never just democracy here.
Because popular sovereignty is lacking at any moment, **[[it]{.mark}
[requires]{.mark} a [supplement]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This is
law]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [When we take a position - such as a
position for democracy - [we rely on law to recall]{.mark} the
[commitments]{.mark} necessarily implicated within this
position]{.underline}. To bring our (democratic) selves back to
ourselves. Law occupies the area of a-position, in between the
determinate commitments necessary to making life more democratic or more
just, and the infinitely responsive dimension of democracy, of justice;
in between our democratic position and that to which we must respond if
we are to maintain our democratic position. [Like \'law\', democracy\'s
condition is always unresolved, calling for incessant decisions and
judgements]{.underline}. Democracy also persists through a relation of
negativity - in condemning and addressing manners of tyranny. [Democracy
takes a position]{.underline} - comes from a position- as law \'comes
from and returns to a position\'. [[Law is where we keep our commitments
to democracy, reinstituting and re-sending these commitments]{.mark} in
the moments of decision, [when]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} as always,
[our [commitment to democracy seems to be dissipating]{.mark} and [we
must respond]{.mark}]{.underline} to a different challenge. [Democracy
must be open, but in this opening it risks becoming something other than
democracy]{.underline}. Alternatively, democracy risks being trapped by
past determinations in the face of new and different challenges - an
enclosure that would render democracy less than democratic in its lack
of responsiveness. [Law resolves]{.underline}, for the time being,
[these paradoxical dimensions of popular sovereignty]{.underline}. 11
[In sum, displacing inquiry from politics to the categories of ontology
will not resolve pressing injustices]{.underline}. Moreover, both
absolute sovereignty and absolute democracy are impossibilities. While
sovereignty must take on certain democratic attributes to achieve
extension- like sharing power through institutional assemblies and
assemblages - [democracy always begins in a place with terms in some way
legislated for it by an other in advance]{.underline}. Both sovereignty
and democracy must contain paradoxical, if not contradictory, attributes
in order to be. And both rely on law for temporary and unstable
resolution of these ambivalent tendencies. That which enables either the
absolute sovereignty of a tyrant or a recording of a democratic success,
however, makes these forms of power vulnerable to ruin. **[[Tyranny
requires the assistance of scriveners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Likewise,
democratic struggles produce victories that can never be absolute as its
plural institutional assemblages create opportunities for ruinous
resistance to democracy\'s commitments. [[Democratic victories are

book The Powers of War and Peace, which finds that the president is not
bound by international law, John [Yoo]{.underline}, a member of the
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) between 2001 and 2003 in George W. Bush\'s
administration, and [[the]{.mark} author of the infamous [\'torture
memo\']{.mark}]{.underline} of August 2002 ,[[justifies]{.mark} the
[internment of Japanese Americans in **concentration
camps**]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Second World War by the US
government (Yoo 2005). He does this in the context of illustrating a
distinction he makes between \'total war\', in which Congress augments
executive war powers with a public declaration of the \[actual existence
of hostilities, and other wars that are conducted without such a public
declaration by Congress. [He finds internment camps to be
constitutional]{.underline} when they are created under the \'pressing
public necessity\' of a \'total\' war. Nevertheless, Yoo is typically
ambiguous about whether the wholesale round-up of Americans or others
would still be constitutional without such a congressional declaration.
He says, \'one doubts\' whether \'courts\' would have allowed
\'wholesale internment\' of \'Panamanian Americans\', \'Yugoslavs\', or
\'Iraqis Americans \[sic\]\', in reference to recent conflicts conducted
without the benefit of a congressional declaration of war, although he
does not clearly rule out the possibility that courts might have upheld
such actions. Moreover, his speculations are on the subject of court
action; he does not clearly state whether he believes such an action to
be properly constitutional even if he is clear that internment should be
considered permissible when there is a congressional declaration of war
(ibid.: 151, 333). To support this position he cites favourably in a
singular endnote the repudiated, though never overruled, Supreme Court
decision Korematsu v. United States (1944), which sustained Fred
Korematsu\'s conviction for refusing to abide by the military\'s
internment order applicable to \'all persons of Japanese ancestry\', and
remaining in a prohibited area: his hometown (Yoo 2005; Irons 1983) .
During the 1940s the United States fought a war against the Nazis\'
camps. Today, however, the United States maintains a camp at a military
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and another at the Baghram airbase in
Afghanistan. 12 [In these camps, hundreds of people have been subjected
to **executive detention**, and many have been **tortured**]{.underline}
(ICRC 2007). Every law is a sending, and this deeply worried a dissenter
from the majority\'s opinion in Korematsu, Justice Jackson, who was
concerned that the validation of racial discrimination would lie around
like a \'loaded weapon\', to be picked up by a future tyrant claiming
\'urgent need\'. Law, Jackson realized, has a \'generative power of its
own\', and every repetition of the principle of \'racial discrimination
in criminal procedure\' and the \'transplanting\' of \'American
citizens\' would embed the principle more deeply in Americans\' \'law
and thinking\', enabling its expansion to \'new purposes\' (Korernatsu
v. United States, with Justice Jackson dissenting at 246). These, as
Jackson recognized, would be ruinous repetitions. Legal struggles, or
democracy\'s archive [**[How are we to resist]{.mark}** the [ruinous
aspects of **tyranny**]{.mark} and keep faith with democracy? [Messianic
postmodernism would have us **abandon law** to oppose **absolute and
total sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the name of absolute
democracy, for Hardt and Negri, [or to experience pure
potentiality]{.underline}, for Agamben . I have shown, however, that
neither absolute sovereignty nor absolute democracy can exist as such.
The perfect absence of democracy and its pure presence are both
foreclosed by the force of necessary iteration, iteration that enables
both democracy and tyrannical sovereignty to be, spectrally. Moreover,
[[pure potentiality gives us **no position** from which to
oppose]{.mark} the [particularities of tyranny, such as
**camps**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Drawing from Fitzpatrick, I have also
indicated that [law facilitates the resolution of]{.underline} (popular)
[sovereignty\'s]{.underline} - of democracy\'s - [paradoxical
dimensions]{.underline} for the time being: the determinate political
position of democracy with democracy\'s openness and responsiveness, for
example. [Law subjects political power to sharing]{.underline}. It is
where democracy is claimed, permitted, and promised. [[Even as law is
always already \'ruined]{.underline}]{.mark}, in ruins, ruinous\',
[[law]{.mark} also [provides for democracy being posited and
**preserved**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Derrida 2002a: 273). Law is where
sovereignty is divided or shared, and it is how we (re )send democracy
(Derrida 2005: 34). [[It is where we enact]{.mark} our [fidelity to
democracy]{.mark} [where we cut into history and **take a position** on
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Derrida 2002a: 289). [Law is where we
take a position on democracy. Law must come from a position, and there
must be a position, or a place, to which law can then return. Law is how
we enact our commitment or responsibility to democracy and to
justice,]{.underline} the commitments and responsibilities we have made
here to those impossibly necessary tasks. In this, [[law]{.mark} assists
our memory and [acts as]{.mark} a [resistance to forgetting even as
law\'s repetitions are generated by the fact that we have always already
forgotten some of these commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[We cannot
keep]{.underline}**]{.mark} such **[[infinite responsibilities in mind
at once]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this resistance to a forgetting that
constantly tracks us, law is like an archive (Derrida 1995: 76, fn. 14).
An archive is where archives, and archiving, take place (Derrida 1995:
2). There where a social order is exercised. Archive, deriving from the
Greek arkhe, articulates a principle of beginning, a law according to
which a practice was begun, a place of depositing, and the question of
who exercises legitimate hermeneutic authority- who has the \'right to
make or represent the law\' (ibid.: 1-3). The notion of an archive
implies a particular region of thought or place, as well as a law - no
archiving without law (ibid.: 40). An archive both conserves and
generates. It gathers in preparation for a future. It is a promise to
others, to our legatees (ibid.: 36). On the one hand, when one
interprets an object of an archive, one\'s interpretation becomes
inscribed into the archive. The archive is a spectral corpus that never
closes since the archivist produces more archive: the archive opens out
to the future (ibid.: 67- 8). Yet, on the other hand, an archive must
also exclude: \'No archive without outside\' (ibid.: 11 , emphasis
removed). The laws of an archive - principles of value and
classification will regulate not only that which has been included and
how it is to be included, but also that which should be excluded to
conserve this trust, so we know how to go on in the future (ibid.: 40).
Nevertheless, as Derrida points out, even that which we exclude shapes
our laws as its phantom continues to haunt us (Ibid .: 61). By thinking
of law as where we take a position, for democracy, for example, and by
thinking of law as an archival practice, we cross a conceptual argument
with an ontological one. The conceptual argument that we share our
powers, our law-making, with others indicates the impossibility of
either the pure absence of democracy or democracy\'s pure presence.
Therefore, even if law and politics do not have in essence a tendency
towards democracy (which is implicated in the conceptual argument) ,
there remains an ineradicable democratic element. 13 Law as archive
meets this conceptual argument with on tic and ontological principles.
An archive takes place. It is deposited somewhere. There is no archive
without substance: there is no archive without a trace (Derrida 1995:
26-7). Could the claim of popular sovereignty, could a democratic
beginning or performative speech act, could the exercise of
self-government, could politics take place where the people, there,
decide to give themselves laws, and could this democratic sending or
legacy disappear without a trace? Could the struggles against tyranny
disappear, totally, without a trace? Would it be responsive or
responsible to democracy or to justice to try to make these things
disappear in order to constitute an absolutely new ontology? Such a
beginning, like any beginning, would have to take place somewhere and
therefore it would have to account for what had given place to such a
beginning. This is the paradox of a democratic beginning: it is never
equal to itself, it is never just democracy. It begins in ruins. This is
where and how we begin, even if we want to begin democratically. But
this is not all bad. Not if there is a resistance to forgetting these
struggles against tyranny as we begin again. We are constituted by
democracy\'s archive, by democracy\'s remainders. By its echoes. We are
not totally foreign to democracy. Not now, and perhaps not ever. Our
contemporary politics takes place within the echoes of languages (some
even dead? Or would that be an impossibility?), making possible our
constitution as political subjects and even as subjects capable of
democracy in ways beyond or perhaps behind our ability to comprehend
(Heller-Roazen 2005). Constitutional law in the United States bears the
impression of confronting fascism nowhere more disturbingly than in the
internment of Japanese Americans, and the Supreme Court\'s infamous
decision Korematsu v. United States upholding the conviction of
Korematsu for violating the Order, which Yoo cites favourably. How has
this case been archived previously? The dissenters in Korernalsu
recognized at the time that the decision had fallen into the \'ugly
abyss of racism\' , that the \' legalization of racism\' plays no
justifiable part in a \'democratic way of life\' (with Justice Murphy
dissenting at 233, 242). One of the dissenters expressed concern
regarding the decision\'s dangerous repetitive potential, as I have
already mentioned. Peter Irons is the author of the definitive study of
the law and politics around the internment of Japanese Americans.
Discussing his sources, Irons notes that the decision faced immediate
and scathing criticism in major law review articles published as early
as 1945. Writing in 1983, Irons finds that in the \'years since the
publication of these articles \... not a single legal scholar or writer
has attempted a substantive defense of the Supreme Court opinions\'
(1983: 371). Aside from the fact that this legal decision found that
courts must apply \'strict scrutiny\' (a legal term of art meaning that
the classification in question must be subjected to the most searching
inquiry and that there is the greatest presumption against the
constitutionality of the governmental policy at issue) to racial
classifications, legal scholars do not view this legal opinion as \'good
law\'. The decision was made at a time when racial segregation was still
allowed in the United States, but the Supreme Court found racial
segregation to be unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education
(1954). Law students and others who study constitutional law are taught
how the racial classification in Korernatsu cannot stand up to the most
basic forms of equal protection analysis (because the classification is
underinclusive by failing to include German or Italian Americans, and
because it is also over-inclusive by including both loyal and disloyal
Japanese Americans; all of this lets us see that the governmental policy
is motivated less by security concerns and more by racism) .14 The
conviction of Korematsu has been overturned because the government was
found to have committed misconduct through the suppression of evidence
and the inclusion of misinformation. And the United States has both
apologized and paid reparations to those interned or their families
(Sullivan and Gunther 2004: 668- 9, fn. 3). As matters of law and
policy, everything about Korematsu, except the notion that there is the
strongest presumption against racial classifications, has been
repudiated and apologized for. The democratic narrative of Korematsu,
based on this archive, is shame and a sense of responsibility for
overcoming the outcome of the case, while maintaining the strongest
presumption against invidious racial classifications. The ruling was
represented as a failure in the struggle against tyranny when it was
issued, and in the manner it has been archived since. Yoo\'s legal
opinions attempt to eviscerate the narrative archiving the outcome of
Korernatsu as wrong, and the principle of racial discrimination as wrong
for a democratic society. These, as Justice Jackson recognized, are
ruinous iterations. The ideas that a president\'s word is law or that
racial guilt is an acceptable premise for government must be excluded to
keep democratic commitments or to send the possibility of a legacy
hospitable for democracy. Any archive must have an outside. But an
archive also constitutes resources to be drawn upon- at present, and for
the future. Taking a position No wonder, then, that messianic
postmodernists - those who wait for being alien to law - wind up
invoking law either to denounce present injustices or to seek a better,
more just, or indeed a more democratic and Jess tyrannical future. If
these are our purposes - [[if we are taking a position against
tyranny]{.underline}]{.mark}- [then [being passively open to **infinite
possibilities**]{.mark} or potentialities [will **not** actively further
those commitments]{.mark}. This is why, [when we have specific
purposes]{.mark} or commitments to which we are faithful, such as taking
a position for democracy, or [when we critique]{.mark}]{.underline} a
process of repetition sedimenting [the [tyranny of
camps]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to open the space for their
rejection , [[we **invoke the law**]{.mark} and draw from democracy\'s
archive]{.underline}. Likewise, when Agamben seeks to preserve a
community of the faithful who will think the \'relation of every instant
to the Messiah\', who will \'strain forward\' towards salvation, he puts
aside the antinomialism of Homo Sacer to embrace \'messianic law\', or
the law of faith (2005b: 76-8, 95). There would be an infinite number of
actions (not) to do if the faithful are to make messianic potential
become active or operative, if they are to live exclusively in the
joyful announcement ( euaggelion). To be sure, these infinite actions
and inactions implicated in pistis (faith) would exceed any finite list
of dos and don \'ts exemplified by the Mosaic law of the Ten
Commandments, and messianic law, or nornos pisteos, refers to this
excessive aspect. [How can the faithful know]{.underline} or remember
[what is required of them at each moment]{.underline} to dwell within
messianic law [if law is not textualized?]{.underline} Agamben explains,
\' \[I\]t is not a letter written in ink on tables of stone; rather, it
is written with the breath of God on hearts of flesh\'. It is \'not a
writing but a form of life \... \'\'You are our letter\"\' (2005b: 122,
quoting 2 Cor. 3:2, emphasis in original). This privileging of the
spirit over the letter of the law attempts to make calculable, measured
law identical to incalculable, immeasurable life by emphasizing the
excessive aspect of law, and maintaining law\'s openness or
responsiveness to the future. [[Through infinite openness, law and life
are one, with no ruins or remainders]{.underline}.
[If,]{.underline}]{.mark} however[, [\'law\']{.mark}]{.underline} is not
to be merely vacuous, [[infinitely open to anything and everything,
hence **no law at all**]{.underline},]{.mark} then we must not forget
what it means to be faithful to the rnessiah. Appropriately, then,
Agamben does not fully forgo textualizing law, citing St Paul \'s
recapitulation of the entirety of God\'s law with the formula \'Love
your neighbor as yourself.\' It helps to learn, to know, to remember
what is required of the faithful, to recall the messianic. To this end,
Agamben refers to law as a \'\"pedagogue\" leading to the messiah\'
(2005b: 76, 120, citing Gal. 3:24, emphasis added). Law is an archive
even for those faithful to the messianic. Similarly, in State of
Exception Agamben critiques recent practices in the United States, such
as the camps at Guant\<inamo Bay and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. He
argues, \'At the very moment when it would like to give lessons in
democracy to different traditions and cultures, the political culture of
the West does not realize that it has entirely lost its canon\' (2005a:
18). Here, Agamben denounces the United States, among others, for having
lost its law. He condemns people in the United States for forgetting
their law and losing their archive, their aide-memoire. Indeed, Agamben
rightly denounces them - us - for it. His
[[denunciation]{.underline}]{.mark} - accusing them, us - [[for
forgetting]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[law pays homage, **as**]{.mark}
**Jean [Baudrillard]{.mark} would have [noted, to the
law]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1988: 173). His denunciation relies on
recalling a law, an archive, and its presently forgotten, suppressed, or
repressed democratic

FROM ICONOCLASM TO MESSIANISM:¶ THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF DESTRUCTION¶
"What remains irreducible to any deconstruction, what remains as
undeconstructible as the possibility itself of deconstruction is,
perhaps, . . . an idea of justice---which we distinguish from law or
right and even from human rights. . . . And deconstruction is mad about
this kind of justice. Mad about this desire for justice." ---Jacques
Derrida¶ [deconstruction reveals itself as a **totalizing
metanarrative**]{.underline} in several modes. [[Through
its]{.underline}]{.mark} "axial [[proposition]{.underline}]{.mark} . . .
[[that there is nothing outside the text]{.underline}]{.mark},"30 it
presents itself as a pantextualism (à la "[all the world's a
text,]{.underline} and all the men and [women merely
readers]{.underline}"). Thus, [what ordinarily passes for extra-textual
reality,]{.underline} [say,]{.underline} historical events such as
**[wars and revolutions,]{.underline}** [are declared]{.underline} by
Paul de Man to be "[texts masquerade\[ing]{.underline}\] in the guise of
wars and revolutions," [while]{.underline} "**[death is a displaced name
for a linguistic predicament]{.underline}**."31 Asserting that writing
is prior to speaking as the condition of its possibility, [[it
sets]{.mark} [itself up]{.mark} against logocentrism]{.underline} as a
grammatocentrism---**[[as totalizing as it accuses logocentrism of
being.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Designed to subvert the claim of any
text]{.underline} and discourse [to an adequate ground---to
a]{.underline} [logos that enables it to produce a stable,]{.underline}
determinate, [decidable, and coherent meaning]{.underline} or
truth---[deconstruction operates as a **totalizing**]{.underline}
[negative hermeneutics]{.underline}. As a negative hermeneutics, patent
in poststructuralism's wholesale assault on Western rationality, its
grand narrative is in its origins largely iconoclastic.¶ ICONOCLASTIC
DESTRUCTION¶ Its chief narrator, Jacques Derrida has been dubbed by a
Swiss journal Herr der Brüche, "Lord of Ruptures." The sobriquet is apt,
as iconoclastic Deconstruction's aim is indeed the exposure of ruptures
and their subversive force in texts and discourses. [To savor its
**Grand Narrative** one has to go along]{.underline},
counter-intuitively, [with]{.underline} a certain topsy-turviness in
[its main tenets]{.underline}. The priority of writing over speaking is
one of them; reality equaling textuality, another. A third [one derives
from]{.underline} [deconstruction's idiosyncratic reading of
Saussurian]{.underline} [linguistics]{.underline},32 [according to
which]{.underline} the material elements of [language]{.underline}
(phonemes, signifiers) and of its conceptual meanings (the signifieds)
[are constituted through opposition to,]{.underline} [and difference
from, other phonetic]{.underline} and semantic [elements]{.underline}.
The deconstructionist reading has the linguistic sign (= signifier +
signified) attain its identity from differential relations as the
condition of its possibility: [hence its]{.underline} bizarre and
[mind-boggling]{.underline} tenet of the [priority of difference over
identity]{.underline}.¶ Now, the linguistic sign, arising as it does out
of such a differential matrix, is said to connote all the differences
from which it sprang as the basis of its identity. [This makes the
determination of meaning problematic]{.underline}: so much so that
meaning is declared indeterminate, or rather its determination deferred
indefinitely. Thus it is not just difference that is operative in the
production of linguistic signs and their meanings, but difference cum
deferral. Both terms are fused in Derrida's neologism différance,
exploiting the double meaning of French différer ('to differ'/'to
defer'). Différance, then, denotes both the production of meaning from
difference and the simultaneous deferral of its determination. Hence
[[the Grand Narrative's postulate of the]{.mark} fundamental
[indeterminacy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} [undecidability of
meaning]{.mark} in]{.underline} all [linguistic]{.underline}
[entities]{.underline}: [every linguistic entity]{.underline}, by virtue
of its being embedded in a polysemic network of differential/
'differantial' relations, [has]{.underline} an overabundance---[a
surplus]{.underline}, an overload---[of signification]{.underline} whose
various elements are at odds with one another, thus [preventing
univocal]{.underline} [meaning]{.underline} from being determined and
decided. As a result, the determination of meaning is postponed to the
Greek Calends. (**[[Obviously]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the meaning of
[**[deconstructionist tenets is exempted from fundamental
indeterminacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and
undecidability]{.underline}**; for **[[they are]{.mark} treated as
determinate [self-evident]{.mark} [truths]{.mark} and eternal
verities]{.underline}**: **[[a deconstructionist ceases behaving as a
deconstructionist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as much as Nietzsche ceases
acting as a perspectivist and skeptic, **[[when]{.mark} they are
[advancing their]{.mark} own [philosophical
enterprises]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark})¶ Différance, then, is
deconstruction's principal and originary (and yes, Derrida's
protestations notwithstanding, foundational and unifying)33 force,
inscribed in the very tissue of language---quaking, quivering, and
reverberating in each and every of its textual and discursive
productions. Universally operative in all texts and all discourses,
différance both generates effects of meaning and truth and, by holding
their determination in interminable abeyance by the play of differences,
undermines them at the same time. In this way, the movement of
différance imparts to language and discourse a Dionysian turbulence and
disorder, and, what is the same, inscribes in them deconstruction as an
inherent force (of which more below). As Roland Barthes remarked in an
obiter dictum: poststructuralism seeks to show not the order but the
disorder of a text. Or, as the Herr der Brüche would have it, not the
coherence of a text but its ruptures.¶ [Nevertheless]{.underline}, the
[texts]{.underline} and discourses of the Western intellectual tradition
[are generally assumed to make the rightful claim that there
is]{.underline} [at their center]{.underline} a [grounding]{.underline}
and controlling logos in one form or another, [giving rise to an
intelligible textual order]{.underline}; and that they arguably do
express and constitute a degree of semantic stability in the form of
decidable and determinate meanings and truths. [The Grand]{.underline}
[Narrative of deconstruction concedes this,]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} it [hastens to add that this is]{.underline} all [a
phantasmagoria fabricated through a ruse of logocentrism:]{.underline}
ever since Plato, we are told, Western logocentrism has been, and still
is, attempting, with apparent success, to arrest or, if you will, freeze
the movement of différance. [By forcing a freeze on]{.underline} its
[Dionysian turbulence, it is]{.underline} extracting from, or [forcing
on, texts]{.underline} [determinate meaning]{.underline} [and decidable
univocal truth, eclipsing]{.underline} in the act [the differential
tissue that is the origin of]{.underline} all
[signification]{.underline}. In the process [Western]{.underline}
[logocentrism]{.underline}, so the grand narratives goes, [either
coercively assimilates and homogenizes, or]{.underline}, failing that,
[excludes]{.underline}, marginalizes, and represses all [that which does
not fit the conceptual order]{.underline} and determinate meaning [it is
said to have arbitrarily extracted from]{.underline}, or forced on,
[texts]{.underline} and discourses. In short, by freezing the movement
of différance (and suppressing the inherent self-deconstruction) in
texts, [logocentrism does violence to all that is other than
itself.]{.underline} [It stands accused of wholesale repression of
alterity]{.underline}. But différance does not take it lying down. This
core force of language strikes back by mobilizing the army of
[deconstructers]{.underline} to [unfreeze differance]{.underline}, by
[re-activating]{.underline} the inherent deconstruction of texts and
discourses: it has [the repressed Other]{.underline} return [in the form
of paradoxes, aporias, incoherences,]{.underline} [illogicalities, and
contradictions that subvert]{.underline} the seemingly [stable meaning
of the texts]{.underline} and turn their apparent logocentric order into
Dionysian chaos. The "deconstruction of all the significations that have
their source in that of the logos," and "particularly the signification
of truth,"34 is to restore the reign of différance. Différance exacts
merciless vengeance from logocentrically ordered texts for having tried
to escape it. In the end these texts, hitherto merely indeterminate and
undecidable as to their meaning, are determinately and decidedly reduced
to clusters of paradoxes, self-contradictions, and aporias---and
predictably so, as this is deconstruction's routine. With every
deconstructive operation, Logocentrism takes a whacking---but hey,
didn't it ask for it?¶ [The]{.underline} strikingly [raw negativity is
patent in the verbs that describe the]{.underline} deconstructive
[operation]{.underline}: "[unravel]{.underline}," "pull down,"
"[annihilate]{.underline}," "[dismantle]{.underline}". [[There
are]{.mark} the occasional affirmative [claims]{.mark}: [that
deconstruction is bearing witness to the]{.mark} repressed
[Other]{.mark}]{.underline} and aids its re-assertion,
[[restoring]{.underline}]{.mark} in the process the vibrant life of a
Dionysian turbulence and liberating [[anarchy to language that
logocentrism is said to]{.underline} [stifle]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[But the forms in which deconstruction has the Other]{.mark} [assert
itself belie this claim: paradox and aporia]{.mark}, by]{.underline}**
**[their very]{.underline}** **[nature, [effect in texts]{.mark} and
discourses]{.underline}** \[**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[not
turbulent life, but the opposite]{.mark}---[paralysis,
death.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶** Equally striking in Miller's concise
description is the inadvertent disclosure that **[[deconstruction's
conclusions are always]{.mark} already [built into its
premises]{.mark}]{.underline}**---thus [its routine procedure amounts to
one huge petitio principii]{.underline}. [[Feed any
text]{.underline}]{.mark}, any discourse [[into the **preprogrammed
interpretative machine**]{.mark} called deconstruction, [and you
know]{.mark} in advance [that it will inevitably come out]{.mark} at the
other end,]{.underline} [**[with depressing]{.underline}** **[regularity
and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[predictability]{.mark},]{.underline}**38
**[[as an ensemble of undecidable aporias]{.mark} and
paradoxes]{.underline}**---as a text or discourse turned against itself,
with hidden ruptures laid bare, [its structure collapsed]{.underline},
[its meaning imploded.]{.underline} Miller's deconstructive reading of
Wordsworth's poem A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal39 is a paradigmatic case
in point. [By smuggling into]{.underline} it [all sorts of]{.underline}
thematic and referential [contraband, the deconstructive critic turns
the poem into a cluster of contradictory significations]{.underline}.
The overall experience is to be, in Miller's description, that of "an
aporia or boggling of the mind." **[[It is an arbitrary
procedure]{.mark} that is [to]{.mark} [make sure that the outcome is
always what the totalizing grand narrative of deconstruction has]{.mark}
postulated and [known all along]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [[namely, that
all]{.mark} [texts will turn out to be
self]{.mark}]{.underline}[-[lacerating,]{.underline} ]{.mark}[aporetic,
self-contradictory]{.underline}, [full of fissures]{.underline} and
internal ruptures---in short, self-deconstructive.

[There are serious limits to [Baudrillard's]{.mark} work, in terms of
his [hostility to 'minority' struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Many of
[his formulations are]{.mark} inadvertently [sexist]{.mark} and
[racist]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are also times when **[Baudrillard
comes across as [ableist]{.mark} in his critiques]{.underline}** of the
therapeutic. There are also times when [[Baudrillard attacks
activism]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} strong terms:
Hippies reproduce capitalist ideology; **[[Feminists]{.mark} displaying
images of porn are actually being seductive, against their
will]{.underline}**; The left is keeping capitalism alive with its moral
critiques and its quests for meaning. There are times when it is hard to
tell if Baudrillard is a reactionary, attacking the concerns of
progressives, or an ultra-left, [criticising every rebellion as
insufficiently extreme]{.underline}. If one looks past such problems,
however, there are important implications in Baudrillard's work for
emancipatory practice. Baudrillard's work was clearly an influence on
Negri's early work. Ideas such as the reduction of the system to
command, the spread of diffuse apparatuses of power and the panic of the
system in the face of its own arbitrariness reappear in texts such as
Time for Revolution. The idea of the 'code' or system functioning as a
self-propelled irrational machine is also reminiscent of primitivists
such as Fredy Perlman. [[Baudrillard seems to see the regime of the code
as the high-point]{.mark} of civilisation]{.underline}, in an almost
anarcho-primitivist sense. Where he differs from such analyses is that
he sees the core of civilisation not in technology or the domestication
of desire or the 'political principle' of state power, but **[in the
denial and suppression of symbolic exchange]{.underline}**. Baudrillard
is partly thinking through the issue of diffuse power. In capitalist and
statist social regimes, power is immensely concentrated. He also gives a
particular spin to the distinction between expressive and instrumental.
**[[We can link the idea of the 'code' to preventionism and its impact
on protest]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As discussed above, Baudrillard's
idea of initiatory groups could also be applied to activist 'neo-sects'.
Baudrillard also offers answers to some of the big questions of today
regarding psychological barriers to revolt. [The loss of
reality]{.underline} might [explain]{.underline} why hope for liberation
seems so hard to come by, and [why revolutionary movements now seem to
lack a clear vision of transformation]{.underline}. The Immediatist
Potlatch would be an example of gift-exchange as political action.
Occupation of the remainders and waste-grounds of cities has been a
constant aspect of dissident practice, from Traveller communities such
as Dale Farm and shanty-towns in the global South, to reclaimed
factories used as squats, to projects such as South Central Farm.
Reversibility could also be thought of in terms of vendettas and
cost-imposition. These return to the system the power it exercises,
reversing it. Another useful way to extend Baudrillard's work is to
cross-read it with Open Marxist views of capitalism as a process which
must constantly be reproduced to exist. Simulation is not a finished
process. It has to be constantly repeated in order to be kept active.
The process of deterrence (or counterinsurgency) is therefore an ongoing
process. Baudrillard is often misread as celebrating the end of
reference and the triumph of self-referential signs. It is easy to see
how this misunderstanding came about, since he advocates outbidding the
system in its own disintegration. He doesn't think it's possible or
desirable to "go back" to production or fixed meanings. But the central
point of his work is still anti-capitalist. He sees the system as unable
to provide anything referential or emotionally meaningful. He sees it as
a kind of totalitarian engine of permanent mobilisation for the empty
goal of its own reproduction. Even in his 'fatalistic' later works, he
remains fiercely opposed to the code and the system. Baudrillard's
critique of Marx is interesting, and I think largely valid. What he puts
in place of Marx's theory is, however, contentious. His recent work
gives the impression of a disillusioned Situationist seeking to find an
alternative to revolution in a world where none is apparent. As a
result, he finds ways to read conformist mass practices as unconscious
resistances, irrational systemic functioning and implosion, and so on.
Baudrillard is also too prone to conflate system collapse with
liberation. There are scenarios of implosion which would not lead to
liberation. One might, for instance, think of climate change due to
overconsumption as a scenario of system-collapse. This would bring about
the end of the code, but also possibly the end of humanity. In some
ways, the idea of implosion echoes Sing Chew's theory of world-system
collapse. Based on previous episodes of collapse, Chew argues that the
world-system will collapse when it reaches its ecological limits. It
won't explode; it will collapse inwards and break down as the processes
which sustain it are reversed. Each 'civilisation' is followed by a
'dark age'. Populations move outwards from cities, power is diffused,
and local knowledge replaces global knowledge. This is not quite what
Baudrillard has in mind, but similar enough to be suggested as an effect
of continued implosion. Or maybe implosion should be compared to the
'extraordinary communities' of disaster, to the sudden collapse of the
system's management structures after which people take over their own
self-management (as in Argentina), to the fraying round the edges of a
system which can no longer secure the code at its more remote limits (as
in Africa). Perhaps as the code burns itself up, we will be left
occupying wastelands where we are finally free, but at great cost.
Hence, an implosive collapse of the system might give rise to a hope for
other social forms. It might, after all, be liberation in disguise. What
of the crucial concept of '[[symbolic exchange']{.underline}]{.mark}?
Baudrillard's discussion of symbolic exchange oscillates between three
poles. Firstly, it **[[refers to the experience of living in an embedded
society]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} rituals, [exchanges]{.mark} and local
knowledges]{.underline}**. Secondly, it refers to the crisis-effects of
the decomposition of the code, which create symbolic exchange as their
effect. Thirdly, [it refers to a kind of experience beyond the regime of
simulation]{.underline}, through arbitrary connections. The political
effects of the process Baudrillard advocates is thus rather ambiguous.
Does the rise of symbolic exchange herald a return to embedded forms of
social relations, to some kind of modern band or tribe which reproduces
aspects of embedded forms, or something else entirely? The recovery of
immediacy, connectedness, uncoded relations, 'exchange' between signs
and the world, are important aspects of disalienation. However, I have
issues with the Lacanian view of the subject which underpins
Baudrillard's theory of symbolic exchange. It is possible to endorse
Baudrillard's view of the death of value in capitalism and the creation
of a self-reproducing code, without necessarily seeing the alternative
in terms of symbolic exchange and death. A wide variety of other
theories are attempting the same thing -- from 'anti-civilisation'
theories to Agamben's 'whatever-singularity'. It might be more useful to
hitch Baudrillard's critique to a more affirmative theory, than to
attempt to follow his 'fatal' strategies. Another important aspect of
Baudrillard's work is his awareness of the close relationship between
sign-value, status, and conformity. People are held back by their
attachment to status. Baudrillard says that the exploited can demand
only the minimum, but lower their status and they can demand everything.
This observation relates to the rise of exclusion and autonomy in
movements of resistance. By becoming autonomous, endorsing a position
outside the system and rejecting the competition for status, the ability
to resist is reclaimed. We can't fight capitalism in determinate forms
because it no longer has a goal, or determination. But we can fight its
'secret weapon': the reproduction of labour as an ideology or imaginary.
This might, for instance, be expressed in the refusal of work. One of
the areas in which Baudrillard's work is particularly useful is media
critique. Media power allows all kinds of shenanigans in international
relations. In Haiti in 2004 for instance, the US could simulate an
entire crisis so as to invade and remove Aristide. The media reproduced
the US narrative to the letter. In this case, simulation aids the
powerful. In Rwanda, according to Peter Uvin, the opposite happened.
External attempts to promote civil society led to a simulated civil
society, produced by local elites to capture aid flows. Arguably, states
in some African countries are themselves simulations, set up to attract
external aid. In such cases, relatively marginal groups extract
resources through mastery of simulation. Baudrillard also seems to have
a sharp sense of the strategic issues facing resistance today. On the
one hand, political positions and subjective standpoints are codified as
representable and quantifiable: as yes/no options on opinion polls, as
particular niche markets susceptible to market research and targeted
advertising, as psychological labels conducive to particular drugs or
CBT methods, as variables to be added to a Facebook profile, and so on.
On the other hand, managerial procedures (classroom management, prison
management, parental management, crisis management, protest management)
are invented to provide a prior meaning and a predetermined response to
each irruptive event. If a dirty protest, then tape up the cell; if a
refusal to move, then send in an 'extraction team' using 'pain
compliance', and so on. The effect is that every option available to
resisters has already been encoded, given a meaning and a response. This
makes the system seem impossible to fight. Its framing of the available
options turns it into a kind of habitus, or second nature, which most
people don't even see as a social construct. The code makes it difficult
to resist, because any act of resistance is reinscribed, either as
another yes/no choice, or as another social problem to be managed. These
are challenges which can be met. Baudrillard's analysis suggests that
the system is vulnerable to any act which disregards consequences or is
irreducible to the existing frame of possibilities, which is not a
"rational action". This is why the loss of fear has been so central in
understanding revolts, from Tahrir Square to Tottenham. In addition, the
system remains vulnerable, both to new tactics which it hasn't thought
of yet, and to any event on such a scale that it overwhelms available
resources. Just-in-time production has reduced redundancy within
systems. The result is that they don't have the resources to spare, to
cope with any events beyond the usual. This is suggested by
Baudrillard's view that the police simply simulate repression. As long
as people are broadly conforming, the simulation works. The moment the
unexpected happens, the police become unable to repress effectively. If
Baudrillard is right, then the slightest thing escaping the system's
rationality is enough to pose a challenge to it. The idea of involution
suggests that the system is beginning to fray around the edges. As
control is tightened, peripheral areas slip out of control. This
phenomenon is widely discussed in relation to the global South. But
fraying can also be seen in the system's apparent incapacity to respond
to emergent events, because of just-in-time production and the
maintenance of systems lacking redundancy. Something like the August
insurrection can spread on the basis of unexpectedness, rapidity and
limited police resources. Baudrillard's theory of deterrence needs to be
reconsidered in light of recent events. We have seen in 2011 that it is
still possible to create events: the London unrest, the student
protests, Occupy, the Wikileaks saga... The system does not actually
have the power on the ground to prevent revolts, occupations, movements.
Even the system's vice-like grip on future significations is being
partially broken through movements like Occupy, which conveys different
future images in its own rhetoric. Anonymous turns the anonymity of
statistical indifference into a source of strength, using tactics based
on the very vulnerability to excess the system creates -- such as
distributed denial of service attacks (using an excess of web
connections) and leaking of documents (relying on the obscene
overexposure of information in the Internet). [[The
difficulty]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, [[is in sustaining
events]{.mark} and expanding new frames of meaning]{.underline}. The
system monopolises and determines the effects of events, and kettles
them in time and space. Firstly the system controls the ways in which
events are signified to non-participants. Secondly [[the
system]{.underline}]{.mark}, having once faced an event, **[[will
prepare in detail to prevent it "next time"]{.mark} -- so it is hard for
events to become waves.]{.underline}** And thirdly, the system unleashes
a dreadful wave of repression after each event, attempting to foreclose
its irruptive force and restore the pervasiveness of terror. Resultant
feelings of futility, anxiety and vulnerability are corrosive of
movement-building and of repeated cycles of similar events. The movement
of revolt towards a terrain of refusal of meaning is also partly an
effect of the system's move towards coding. The apparent lack of demands
in recent waves of social unrest (e.g. the Mark Duggan uprising, the
banlieue revolt, the Greek insurrection of 2008, the Occupy movement,
summit protests), and even many of today's "terrorists", is perhaps a
result of the prevalence of the code. The presentation of demands risks
reinscription as simply a militant version of a position already encoded
within the system. People respond with actions which counterpose their
own expressiveness to the code. This is also perhaps why theorising the
conditions of possibility for an Event has become such a popular theme
in contemporary radical theory. Another possibility could here be added.
It is possible, in open-ended surveys, to give responses deemed too
complex to be codable. In principle, a more heterogeneous humanity would
escape the code through each individual's irreducibility to prior
categories. There are also certain texts, such as Cabal, Argot and
Barbarians, which argue for incommunicability as a necessary part of
radicalism. The system demands that everything communicate in its terms.
Therefore, esoteric language is an effective resistance. Baudrillard's
theory also helps to explain why his appropriation by leftists has been
strategically unsuccessful. Collectivist theories such as Negri's are
limited in that they fail to see the overexposure to the social. The
masses do not feel a simple lack of the social but an overexposure --
both in the pressure to consume sign-values, and in telepresence.
Collectivist alternatives open up a vertigo, seeming like more of the
same, but even more totalising. Of course, Negri's alternative would be
a disalienated sociality, not a more totalising simulation. But if
Baudrillard is right, most people can no longer tell the difference. And
the move Negri makes -- to attempt to re-socialise what he takes to be
an atomised field -- is the wrong move to recompose disalienated
socialities. It is not a move which leads from the masses, the social
'obscene' or overexposed, to a disalienated sociality. Recomposition
requires first of all the decomposition of people's connections to a
dominant sociality. People need to rebel against this collectivism as a
'new individualism', an emphasis on desire and self-actualisation
against the pressure to conform, before alternative social forms based
on autonomy can be constructed. Today's sociality rests on conformity
rather than compassion. An authentic sociality can only proceed by
rejecting and destroying this basis. At the same time, individuals
cannot become free without transforming from a type of subject which
internalises the code. The conception of self which is an after-effect
of conformity, the neoliberal subject, is as much a barrier to
self-liberation as to compassion. **[One limit to [Baudrillard's
theory]{.mark} is his tendency to [over-totalise]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Baudrillard is talking about tendential processes, but he often talks as
if they are totally effective. [There are still, for instance, a lot of
[uncharted spaces]{.mark}, a lot of unexplained events, a lot of things
the system can't handle.]{.underline} While Baudrillard is describing
dominant tendencies in the present, these tendencies coexist with older
forms of capitalism, in a situation of uneven development. The
persistence of the system's violence is a problem for Baudrillard's
perspective: the smooth regime of neutralisation and inclusive
regulation has not ended older modalities of brutality. At times,
[[Baudrillard exaggerates greatly]{.mark} the extent to which the old
authoritarian version of capitalism has been replaced by subtle regimes
of control]{.underline}. **[[He exaggerates the extent to which
contemporary capitalism is tolerant, permissive and
'maternal']{.underline}]{.mark}**. This may be because his works were
mostly written in France in the 1970s-80s, when the dominant ethos was
still largely social-democratic. What Baudrillard recognises as the
retrograde version of capitalism associated with the right-wing was to
return with a vengeance, especially after 911.

#### We've got a few questions for Baudrillard -- postmodernism destroys objective reality and justifies horrific indefinite acts

Catherine A. **MacKinnon**, June **2000**, "*Points against
Postmodernism*," Chicago-Kent Law Review,
<https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&context=cklawreview>,

In other words, [[the harm of]{.mark} second class [human status does
not pose]{.mark} [an abstract reality question]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[In]{.mark} social [life]{.mark}, [there is little that is subtle
about]{.mark} most [rape]{.mark}s; there is nothing complex about a fist
in your face; [there is nothing nuanced about genocide]{.mark}-although
many nuanced [questions]{.mark} no doubt [can be raised]{.mark} about
them]{.underline}**. These social realities, central to feminism, do not
raise difficult first-order reality questions, not any more. [[It is the
denial of their]{.mark} social [reality that is complicated]{.mark} and
raises difficult philosophical questions]{.underline}. **[Understand
that [the denial of]{.mark} the [reality]{.mark} of such events has been
a philosophical position about reality itself.]{.underline}** Unless and
until effectively challenged, only what power wants to see as real is
granted reality status. Reality is a social status. Power\'s reality
does not have to establish itself as real in order to exist, because it
has the status as real that power gives it; only the reality of the
powerless has to establish itself as real. Power can also establish
unreality-like the harmlessness of pornography or smoking-as reality.
That doesn\'t make it harmless. But until power is effectively
challenged on these lies, and they are lies, only those harmed (and
those harming them, who have every incentive to conceal) have access to
knowing that that is what they are. So it has taken us all this time,
and a movement that has challenged male power, to figure out that
women\'s reality is also a philosophical position: that **[[women\'s
reality exists]{.mark}, including women\'s denied violation,
[therefore]{.mark} social [reality exists]{.mark} separate from its
constitution by male power or its validation by male
knowledge]{.underline}**. [[This analysis raises some questions about
postmodernism]{.underline}]{.mark} that are not simply a report on my
current mental state. [[They are]{.mark}: [Can postmodernism stop the
rape of children]{.mark} when everyone has their story, and everyone is
presumably exercising sexual agency all the time[?]{.mark} [Can
postmodernism identify fascism if power only exists in
microcenters]{.mark} and never in systematic, fixed, and determinate
hierarchical arrangements[?]{.mark} [How can you oppose something that
is always only in play?]{.mark} [How do you organize against something
that isn\'t even really there]{.mark} except when you are thinking about
it[?]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Can postmodernism hold the perpetrators of
genocide accountable?]{.underline}]{.mark}** [If the subject is dead,
and we are dealing with deeds without doers]{.underline},47 [[how do we
hold perpetrators accountable]{.mark} for what they
perpetrate[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Can the Serbian]{.mark} cultural
[defense for the extermination of Croats]{.mark}, [Bosnian
Muslims]{.mark}, [and Kosovar Albanians be far
behind?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[If we can have]{.mark} a multicultural
[defense for the current genocide]{.mark}, because that\'s how the Serbs
see it, [why not a German]{.mark} cultural [defense for the earlier
one?]{.mark} Anti-Semitism was part of German culture. Finally, for
another old question, if you only exist in opposition, if you are only
full in opposition to the modern]{.underline},48 [it has determined you.
Don\'t you need [an account]{.mark} of how you are not merely
reiterating your determinations? **[From postmodernists]{.mark}, one [is
not yet forthcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[The postmodernist
reality corrosion]{.mark}, thus, [not only makes it incoherent]{.mark}
and useless]{.underline}**-the pragmatists\' valid criticism49- **[[but
also regressive, disempowering, and
collaborationist]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Boundaries between the simulation and material existence are inevitable- Baudrillard destroys our consciousness of these inevitable boundaries, leading to extinction

**Hayles '91**, (N. Katherine, Prof. of English @ UCLA, [The Borders of
Madness]{.underline}, *Science Fiction Studies* #55 vol. 18, part 3,
November 1991, http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/55/forum55.htm)

These writers differ from Baudrillard in openly acknowledging that their
texts are fictional. In fiction it is possible to elide the materiality
of the world and thus to erase the gap between simulation and reality.
[[Baudrillard\'s stance]{.mark},]{.underline} by contrast, [[is that the
gap has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[been erased for us here
now,]{.mark}]{.underline} and erased everywhere[.\
[Resisting this claim is the continuing materiality of the
world]{.mark},]{.underline} which for convenience I will call reality.
In reality, [borders count]{.underline}. Consider Southern California,
which comes as close to hyperreality as anything in the US. [The
bumper-to-bumper traffic that surrounds Disneyland has a material
intractibility]{.underline} and a stubborn resistance to manipulation
that make it quite different from the simulations within the park. [Even
within the boundaries of simulations, material intractability often
breaks in.]{.underline} In a virtual reality simulation, when one moves
one\'s head too fast for the computer program to keep up, the display
breaks down. [The trip through]{.underline} Disneyland\'s [Space
Mountain]{.underline}, with its vertiginous rocketing through simulated
galaxies, [is]{.underline} customarily [preceded by several hours of
standing in a barely-moving line]{.underline} under the hot California
sun. Of course it would be possible to simulate these conditions, too.
No one is likely to do so, however, for [the point of simulations is
precisely to overcome the limitations of physical
existence]{.underline}. When Ballard in his introduction to *Crash*
(Vintage ed., 1985) identifies the defining characteristic of the 20th
century as \"the concept of unlimited possibility\" he articulates very
well why we are fascinated with simulations. [[The borders separating
simulations from reality are important because they remind us of the
limits that make dreams of technological transcendence dangerous
fantasies.]{.mark} [Hyperreality does not erase these
limits,]{.mark}]{.underline} [for [they exist whether we recognize them
or not; it only erases them from our consciousness. Insofar as
Baudrillard\'s claims]{.underline} a]{.mark}bout hyperreality [[diminish
our awareness of these limits, it borders on a madness whose likely end
is apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}**.** As Pynchon vividly demonstrated
in *Gravity\'s Rainbow*, [an obsessional desire to avoid death itself
becomes the death it seeks to elide.]{.underline}

### L\-\--Setcol

#### The aff's understanding of signs as [disconnected]{.underline} from their original referents is a [colonial logic]{.underline} that [decenters]{.underline} and [delegitimizes]{.underline} Native perspectives and literature -- we [can discern knowable truth]{.underline} and that is the truth of genocide that permeates historical and modern manifestations of settler colonialism.

[Postmodernism is all about bringing margins into the play and rejecting
grand narratives]{.underline}. Michael Dear and Gregg Wassmansdorf point
out in Postmodern Consequences that [postmodernists learn to
contextualize and reject meta-theories in favor of undecidability and
microexplanations and renounce the universal truth]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, Craig Womack's statement that **[there is Native American
truth and it is worth looking for]{.underline}** (Womack 4) seems to be
more convincing, [especially in terms of **quest for sovereignty** and
**re-establishment of Native histories and their validity**. It is way
too premature for Native scholars to deconstruct history when we haven't
yet constructed it]{.underline}. [We need]{.underline}, for example, [to
recover the nineteenth century, especially in terms of understanding
what Native writers were up to during that time and how their struggles
have evolved toward what Indian writers can say in print today, as well
as foundational principles they provide for an indigenous
criticism]{.underline}. (Womack 3) [**Deconstructing history and
identity** would **negate the whole purpose of American Indian
literature,**]{.underline} which, by many scholars, is identified as a
support of sovereignty. **[Postmodernism deconstructs
identity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[gets rid of Native American
points of view,]{.underline}** thus [putting Native perspective as well
as Native narrative and story **out of existence.**]{.underline} Womack
points out that [postmodernism has a "**tendency to decenter
everything**, **including the legitimacy of a Native
perspective**]{.underline}" (Womack 6). Therefore, on the one hand, it
undermines the ideology of the dominant mainstream society by ridding it
of the notion of "alien other" and introducing it into the positive
world of differences. On the other hand, [the loss of center leads to
the loss of meaning and history, therefore devaluing Native perspective
as well as five hundred years of colonization that is still
on-going.]{.underline} This brings us back to the concept of simulacrum,
where surface is all that matters and what replaces the meaning and
truth. For the entire period of colonization that is exactly what Native
American tribes have been fighting for -- the deeper understanding of
who they are and what they represent instead of the generalization of
all the tribes by what lies on the surface. On the other hand, if one
sides with Hutcheon, [postmodernism is what questions the truth and
history and states that they are problematic, therefore, opening the
mind to new suggestions and viewpoints by questioning the meta-narrative
of history performed by the mainstream society]{.underline}. Thus, the
representation is not reduced to empty, but its process, forms, and
outcomes are questioned. The problem here is that [while such
questioning of the Euro-American grand narrative might be eye-opening,
postmodernism does not stop there. The concept of simulacrum (a copy of
a copy) puts Native American literature in quite an interesting
predicament since one of its purpose is to **re-claim back one of the
spheres of indigenous art** as well as perform a historical function in
many cases by portraying the Native perspective. The notions of
**postmodernism, if applied to Native American literature** in this
case, would **suggest that** Native American writers are **recreating
what has already been created**;]{.underline} the main question in that
case is what exactly are they recreating -- their tribal tradition or
texts about Native Americans produced by non-Natives with numerous
errors and misinterpretations? Would postmodernism, thus, pose a danger
of the implication of the latter variant? Then, **[the whole notion of
tribal culture would be destructed.]{.underline}** Regarding the purpose
of Native American literature, [postmodernism as art that mainly focuses
on investigation of its own nature might not be adequate since it
suggests the existence of literature for the sake of itself and its
experimentation with itself. Native American literatures]{.underline},
on the other hand, [serve a different purpose and mainly exist as the
voice of the Native communities and a means to serve these communities
in various ways in their pursuit of sovereignty.]{.underline} A glimpse
of hope can be found in Hutcheon's statement that
[postmodernism]{.underline} is all about ideology and history;
therefore, the [texts are historical and political]{.underline}, but
[they bear that character through parody. It does not seem that Native
American literature is trying to parody the history told from the
perspective of the dominant white society; it does not attempt to mock,
but merely to tell the new story from its own perspective that has been
silenced for so long]{.underline}. One has to admit that there are
exceptions in Native American literature and some writers do use this
approach to literary texts. For instance, Sherman Alexie uses parody on
a regular basis. However, the question is whether it is perceived by the
readers unaware of cultural realities as such. Maybe that is why Alexie
is so often blamed for perpetuating stereotypes. According to Womack,
[Abenaki poet Cheryl Savageau]{.underline}, while in college, [was
labeled an essentialist]{.underline} by one of her professors because
she published an article in a newspaper on Native writers and land
issues. [She wrote]{.underline} in correspondence to Womack: ["The same
professor who labeled me 'essentialist', said there was no truth, no
history, just lots of people's viewpoints. I argued that some things
actually did happen. That some versions of history are not just a point
view, but actual distortions and lies"]{.underline} (qtd. in Womack 3).
Savageau goes on to say that [it is curious that exactly then, when
Native Americans]{.underline} are finally starting to [tell their story
from their perspective, **all of a sudden there is no truth, but only
points of view.**]{.underline} She states that [it is a **political move
by the EuroAmerican academia** to **safeguard itself** from having to
deal with all the minority stories, whether they are African-America,
American Indian, or gay and lesbian]{.underline}. She points out that
[this "equality" of everybody's stories frees the mainstream from
accountability since there is then "no need to change anything, no need
for reparations, no arguments for sovereign nation status, and their
\[mainstream\] positions of power are maintained"]{.underline} 64
(Womack 4). Therefore, Womack underlines the importance of discovering
and rediscovering what has been made implicit and making it explicit:
"[at least until we get our stories told, especially in terms of
establishing a body of Native criticism in relation to
nineteenth-century writings, postmodernism may have some limitations in
regards to its applicability to Native scholarship]{.underline}" (Womack
4). Womack remarks [the vital part that nineteenth-century Indian
literature of resistance played in the establishment of Native American
literatures. Indian people produced works that argued for the rights of
the indigenous nations and criticized land theft]{.underline}. The fact
that postmodernism lets the marginalized voices be heard by rejecting
the meta-theory of the mainstream society seems, on the one hand, rather
promising to Native American literature with respect to the fact that
the voices are finally going to be heard. On the other hand, American
Indian literary works to a great extent are dependent and subordinate to
the meta-theory of Native American nations, which in our modern
condition is a fight for independence and rights. "[Native literary
aesthetics must be politicized and that autonomy, self-determination,
and sovereignty serve as useful literary concepts.]{.underline} \[...\]
[literature has something to add to the arena of Native political
struggle]{.underline}" (Womack 11). Postmodernism is one of the most
notoriously ambiguous terms in literature and it is far from including
every literary work written nowadays. Postmodernism is a movement and
thought that influences all spheres of life; therefore, it can be
considered as a social epoch, aesthetic, a style in art, and a cultural
dominant, all at the same time. It reconsiders the values of modern
society and puts them into question. Craig Owens points out that however
we decide to define it, it is usually treated as a crisis of cultural
authority, i.e. Western European culture and its authority and
domination are questioned, and it is brought to the public's attention
that encounters with other cultures do not necessarily have to happen
through conquest or domination (Owens 57). Therefore, [the main
characteristic of the postmodern age, which gives Native American
culture on the whole a new perspective, is the coexistence of different
cultures.]{.underline} In theory, it puts an end to ethnocentrism. That
is why Lyotard talks about meta-narrative (grand narrative) versus
little narrative. Postmodern theory does away with meta-narrative as an
overpowering and globalizing cultural narrative that dictates the rules,
with the idea that it explains all historical experience from one
perspective. But does that theory become reality? On the other hand,
[postmodernism brings about **deconstruction** and]{.underline} to a
certain extent [the **devaluing of culture and identity**]{.underline}.
Paul Ricoeur wrote: [When we discover that there are several cultures
instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge the
end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are
threatened with the destruction of our own discovery]{.underline}.
Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just others, that we
ourselves are an "other" among others. All meaning and every goal having
disappeared, it becomes possible to wander through civilizations as if
through vestiges and ruins. The whole of mankind becomes an imaginary
museum: where shall we go this weekend -- visit the Angkor ruins or take
a stroll in the Tivoli or Copenhagen? We can very easily imagine a time
close at hand when any fairly well-to-do person will be able to leave
his country indefinitely in order to taste his own national death in an
interminable, aimless voyage. (Ricoeur 278) This is basically what we
know today as the postmodern condition, but as Owens states, [it reduces
difference to indifference]{.underline} (Owens 58). Therefore, [this
might bring about the undesired effect into interpretation of Native
American literature]{.underline}. Can it be that [instead of stressing
the value of Native literary difference, the indifference to the Native
viewpoint can be brought about by postmodern
interpretations]{.underline}? [The purpose]{.underline}, however, is
quite the opposite; [it is to]{.underline} prove the independence and
value of indigenous literary traditions, as well as [put it on an equal
level with Western literature]{.underline}. Therefore, [it is important
for Native American literature to make a difference, not to create
**indifference originated by postmodern apathy**]{.underline}. Thus,
[Womack stresses the need for a literary criticism that emphasizes
Native resistance movements against colonialism, confronts racism,
discusses sovereignty and Native nationalism, seeks connection between
literature and liberation struggles, and, finally, roots literature in
land and culture]{.underline}. [This criticism emphasizes unique Native
worldviews and political realities, searches for differences as often as
similarities, and attempts to find Native literature's place in Indian
country.]{.underline} (Womack 11) Therefore, [Native American literary
criticism has to be with regard to culture, community, and its current
issues, and its purpose is to support the continuity of this specific
culture instead deconstructing it and turning it into a mere tourist
attraction]{.underline}.

Debord's [central thesis or provocation is that life in a
"commodity-saturated, massmediated, image-dominated and
corporate-constructed world" engenders an increasingly isolated,
alienated, and passive citizenry that unwittingly relents to a
groupthink of market consciousness disguised as individual
agency]{.underline} (Kaplan 2012, p. 458). His analysis illuminates the
inherent paradox of spectacle; despite (or because of) its intention to
illicit emotion and (re)action, spectacle produces alienation and
passivity. Particularly in a mass-mediated, hi-tech society, the sheer
volume of content alone can produce a deadening effect. But spectacle is
both dialectical and self-perpetuating. Meaning, the resulting
(individual and social) [ennui searches for relief from the deadening
effect and, in so doing, activates the production of ever more
spectacular imagery, generating an endless and alienating cycle of
(simulated) life in search of the "real." As the search intensifies, so
does the desire for anything perceived as "authentic" -- authenticity is
the antidote]{.underline} (For early and consistently excellent
discussions of the desire for "authentic" nature and culture see the
work of Dean MacCannell 1976.). [It is this cycle -- the **positioning
of spectacularity against "authenticity**" and **authenticity as the
antidote to the (post)modernist condition** -- that **compels this
analysis**, particularly in the wake of #NoDAPL]{.underline}. **[For as
long as "Indians" have been situated as the (authentic) anti-modern
subject, "Indian-ness" has perennially served as a favored foil
(antidote) for whiteness.]{.underline}** While many Indigenous studies
scholars have examined the ways in which **[Native identity is
appropriated in the service of white identity formation]{.underline}**
(e.g., Berkhofer 1987; Deloria 1969, 1998; Huhndorf 2001), my interest
is cast more broadly. That is, beyond questions of white identity
formation: [How does the expressed desire for the imagined Indian serve
the propertied interests of whiteness, which is to say settler
statecraf]{.underline}t? To explore this question, I begin with more
mundane expressions of Indian-as-spectacle and move toward their deeper
implications. Currently, there are 20 reality shows in circulation that
stage interventions (read: provide antidotes) for the normative hegemony
of white-middle-class life by depicting life on the "frontier" or "the
wild." (Among the current shows are: Survivor, Colonial House, Alaska
Bush People, Frontier House, and Man vs. Wild.) Through their ubiquity
and popularity, such shows evidence the extent of **[settler-desire for
the imperialist fantasy of "pre-modernist" times]{.underline}** at the
same time they **[appease settler supremacy]{.underline}**. They refract
what McLintock (McClintock and Robertson 1994) refers to as "panoptical
time," (More specifically, McLintock (1994) defines [panoptical time as
"the image of global history consumed -- at a glance -- in a single
spectacle from the point of privileged invisibility]{.underline}" (p.
128).) a key component of imperialist discourse that situates progress
as fundamentally contingent upon on a "shadow other," which is, of
course, the savage (Pardy 2010). Indeed, as noted by Rosaldo (1989) "[In
this ideologically constructed world of ongoing progressive change,
**putatively static** ~~savage~~ \[**pre-modern\] societies** become a
**stable reference point for defining\...civilized
identity**]{.underline}" (p. 70). [Native peoples are so much "a shadow"
that with the exception of one show]{.underline} (Frontier House) [they
are not even present -- literally eliminated from settler
view]{.underline}. In this sense, [progress is the central character, so
critical to settler mythology that it drives a deep-seeded need to
**continually perform the fabled journey** from ~~savage~~
\[**pre-modern\] to civilized over and over again**]{.underline};
[settler-subjects playing out fantasies of the colonial encounter as
theater.]{.underline} There was one reality show about Native peoples --
Escaping Alaska -- which, depicted five Alaska Native youth (identified
as "Eskimos") "secretly" plotting to leave their families and homeland
in order to experience life in the lower 48. True to Debord's thesis,
the society of the spectacle can only produce grotesque caricatures. In
this instance, Inuit youth are depicted as members of a virtual cult
that apparently holds their members' captive and in complete ignorance
of the "outside" world. Baloy (2016) theorizes the oscillation between
the complete erasure and hyperreality of Indigenous peoples in terms of
"spectrality" (i.e., a state of haunting). She deploys [the term
"holographic Indigeneity" to describe the phenomena of Native peoples
hyper-visibility "from some angles" and invisibility from others --
always a constant presence even in moments of apparent
absence]{.underline} (p. 209).

As intimated however, [[Baudrillard\'s]{.mark} revolutionary [project
has **serious structural flaws**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. [His

[[envisages]{.mark} a]{.underline} spontaneous, impassioned, **[almost
[mystical overthrow]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of the]{.mark} general
[code, but]{.mark} his]{.underline} previous [delineation
of]{.underline} political economy as **[a master-device
of]{.underline}** mobilization and [**[co-optation]{.underline}**
[renders this]{.underline}]{.mark} [option **paltry and
[improbable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The entanglements of his polemic on
this point graphically illustrate the difficulties confronting
revolutionary discourse.¶ Like Derrida, [[Baudrillard asserts]{.mark}
that [all binary oppositions convey a **hidden
hierarchy**]{.mark}]{.underline}- use-value rebounds to the advantage of
exchange-value, concrete labor is the satellite of abstract social labor
etc.- [[which reproduce]{.mark} in miniature [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
definitive [[form]{.underline}]{.mark} of [political economy. In order
[to transgress the code]{.mark}, accordingly, [these]{.mark} hierarchies
[cannot]{.mark} simply [be reversed, they must be
**subverted**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[In
theory,]{.underline}**]{.mark} [symbolic [ambivalence designates]{.mark}
this [subversion]{.mark}]{.underline} and symbolic exchange
characterizes the realm of originary transgression. **[[In]{.mark}
theoretical [practice]{.mark}, however,]{.underline}** [[these
terms]{.underline}]{.mark} only appear, and **[[only]{.mark} can
[appear,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in opposition to the logic of
equivalence]{.mark} and exchange-value,]{.underline}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} what amounts to [[**a new hierarchy.**
Baudrillard invariably pronounces concrete]{.mark} qualitative
[use-value]{.mark},]{.underline} whether [of commodities or
labor,]{.underline} **[[abstract by comparison to]{.mark} the \"richness
of [symbolic exchange.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[He]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[installs]{.mark} the symbolic as [the
**new, concrete** ]{.mark}**qualitative [base,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[reinscribing the]{.mark} line of [division]{.mark} between (simulated)
reality and its abstract reduction. As soon as it enters this binary
scission]{.underline}, which is to say in its genesis as a concept,
[[the symbolic object]{.mark} or relation [is **overdetermined as**
]{.mark}**the [anti-productive, reduced to the irreducible, reified
as]{.mark} that which is in itself [non-reifiable, and measured
according to the uniform, rational standard]{.mark} of
valence.**]{.underline} [[Thus]{.underline}]{.mark}, at a higher level,
commanding a greater range and depth of content, [Baudrillard\'s
[critique **mirrors Marx**]{.mark}**\'s critique [mirroring]{.mark} the
logical form of [political economy]{.mark}.**]{.underline} He is to Marx
what he claims Marx is to Feuerbach.¶ A related contradiction appears on
the anthropological or subjective side of things. Baudrillard\'s
revolutionary discourse cannot admit to rising from or answering to any
fundamental need or moral good, having already branded both idealistic
fictions produced by the general code for its preservation and
aggrandizement. Further, [in holding the code to govern \"all
production, material or symbolic,\" Baudrillard\'s theory,]{.underline}
a most rational production to be sure, [inferentially defines itself as
an expression of the code]{.underline} and an extension of its domain.
**[This [coopted status]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} in
turn [[explain the tendency]{.mark} of his argument [to
establish]{.mark}, at a second level and against his better judgment,
**[a new binary structure]{.mark} or scission.**]{.underline} For
[whatever Baudrillard openly espouses, [it]{.mark} is clear that **he
[takes symbolic ambivalence]{.mark} and exchange [as
the]{.mark}**]{.underline} arche (**[[motive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
impetus, matrix) **[[and]{.mark} the [telos]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(point, prescription, purpose) [of his theoretical project. [But]{.mark}
as Derrida]{.underline} effectively [demonstrates, **the [presumption of
an end entails]{.mark} the [presumption of an
essence.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Baudrillard restores the \"keystone of
ideology\" as he does \"**concrete**\" reality]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark}[, in so doing, [proves the code]{.mark}
**doubly [inescapable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In explicitly denying
human essence, he situates his revolutionary impulse as strictly a
code-effect, by implicitly affirming Man\'s essence, he buttresses the
code-form. The problem lies in the polemical gesture itself. Proceeding
by and mirroring the logic of opposition, \"the critique is perhaps only
the subtle long-term expression of the system\'s expanded reproduction\"
\[MP 50\].¶ The specific character of human essence
[Baudrillard]{.underline} has hit upon [deepens the impression that
**[a]{.mark} Derridean [double-bind is inherent to his
enterprise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In order to make a clean break with
the rational finality of the code, Baudrillard is driven to a position
unmistakably akin to the noble savage mythos so prevalent during the
earliest stages of capitalism. At that time, it served as an essential
ideological force in the bourgeois revolution, countervailing the
monarch\'s claim of divine sanction with an appeal to the empirically
revealed law of Nature. Now the same mythos represents an ill-defined
objective, without known means of attainment or substantive ideological
consequences, just the sort of harmless opposition political economy
entertains and perhaps even manufactures. Addressing the plight of
Marxism in the monopolistic phase, [Baudrillard avers that \"[the system
can afford the luxury of contradiction]{.mark} and
dialectic]{.underline} through the play of signs. [It can indulge itself
with all the signs of revolution. Since it produces all the responses,
it annihilates the question in the same blow\"]{.underline} \[MP
126-27\]. [[Symbolic exchange would]{.mark} seem to [be **just the sort
of** ]{.mark}**revolutionary [diversion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
diversion for and from the revolutionary impulse, **[which [Baudrillard
remarks]{.mark} here]{.underline}**. As Marx\'s privileging of the
concrete was to the social abstractions of early capitalism, so
Baudrillard\'s fetishism of the primitive is to the hyper-technical
hyper-artificial tenor of today: a countersign and so a systemic
simulation.

[Although Baudrillard's work on "simulation"]{.underline} and
"simulacra" [is valuable]{.underline} in highlightingthe relationship
between the mass media and reality, and, in particular, [the ways in
which media content]{.underline} (images and narratives) [come to be
**de-contextualised,** his theses are]{.underline} per se [insufficient
for]{.underline} the [analysis]{.underline} of the contemporary mass
media. For instance, asmedia theorist and researcher Douglas Kellner
(2003:31) notes, beyond the level of media spectacle, [[Baudrillard does
not help readers understand]{.mark} events such as [the Gulf War,
because he **reduces**]{.mark} **the [actions]{.mark} of actors** [and
**complex political issues** to]{.mark} categories of
"[simulation]{.mark}"]{.underline} and "hyper-reality", [in a sense
"**[erasing their concrete determinants]{.mark}**".]{.underline}

[[Kellner]{.underline}]{.mark}, who like Baudrillard, has written
extensively on media spectacles, including theGulf Wars, [[sees
Baudrillard]{.mark}'s theory [as]{.mark}]{.underline} being
"**[[one]{.mark}-[dimensional]{.mark}]{.underline}**",
["privilege\[ing\] the form of media technology over its content,
meaning and...use]{.underline}" (Kellner, 1989:73). In thisregard,
[[Baudrillard]{.mark} [does not account for the political economic
dimensions of the newsmedia]{.mark}, nor the cultural practices
involved]{.underline} with the production of news (Kellner, 1989:73-74).
Thus, [[he suffers from]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [technologically
deterministic [essentialism]{.mark}]{.underline} thatundermined the
media theories of Marshall McLuhan, albeit in a different form
(Kellner,1989:73-74). Although Kellner (2003:32) believes that
Baudrillard's pre-1990s works on "the consumer society, on the political
economy of the sign, simulation and simulacra,and the implosion of
\[social\] phenomenon" are useful and can be deployed within
criticalsocial theory, he prefers to read Baudrillard's later, more
controversial and obscure, workas "science fiction which anticipates the
future by exaggerating present tendencies"

[**In order [to understand war]{.mark}** and its relationship with the
media in the contemporary era [it is,]{.mark}]{.underline} then,
[[necessary to move beyond Baudrillard]{.mark}'s spectacular
theory]{.underline} of media spectacle. For [[although our culture is
resplendent with images]{.underline}]{.mark}, signs and narratives,
circulating [in aseemingly endless dance of mimicry (or, rather,
simulacra), [there are **observable social institutions and practices
producing this semiotic interplay**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Although
all that is solidmight melt into air (Marx and Engles, 2002:223),
[appearances and **[illusions are not an end for]{.mark}**]{.underline}
sociological [**[analysis]{.mark}**, but are rather a]{.underline}
seductive [invitation to further social inquiry.]{.underline} As the
research of Douglas Kellner (1992; 1995; 2005) has shown, [[when]{.mark}
media [spectacles are **dissected by critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}
cultural [[**analysis**, re-contextualisation is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Images and [narratives can be traced
back to their sources: whether]{.mark} they lie in Hollywood [fantasies
or **government 'spin'**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, **[[by
assessing the veracity of competing texts, war]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(as understood by media audiences) **[[can be re-connected to its
antecedents and consequences.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Indeed, [[through
wrestling with]{.mark} the [ideological spectres]{.mark} of myth and
narrative, [and]{.mark} by [searching]{.mark} widely [for critically

can acquire an understanding of the]{.mark} ['truthfulness' of]{.mark}
media [representations]{.mark};]{.underline} [of the 'authentic' in a

[competing]{.underline} media [voices]{.underline} on which to construct

certain extent, [force the media to grapple with their own disparate
reflections.]{.underline}

3 CONCLUSIONS

3.1 REST IN PEACE BAUDRILLARD?

In the final analysis, then, Baudrillard's work on the Gulf War and the
September 11terrorist attacks should (respectfully) be laid to rest. For
although some, such as RichardKeeble (2004:43), have followed
Baudrillard in arguing that "there was no war in the gulf in 2003", such
statements are somewhat antithetical to the truth aims of the social
sciences. Baudrillard, being both an icon and iconoclast, pushed his
language and arguments to rhetorical extremes in order to force the
collapse of representations andarguments he saw as having supplanted
truth. His fatal theory was in a sense intellectual 'hype', for a
capricious world in which only 'hype' can be noticed. Yet in shouting
his arguments he served to obfuscate their nuance and subtext, the very
intellectualessences of his work and, ultimately, his contribution to
the body of knowledge.

However, although fatal theory is of little practical use for media
researchers seeking anempirically derived 'truth', Baudrillard's oeuvre
is still (somewhat) instructive, remindingus of the importance of
de-mystifying reality. For [although the voice of the [scholar]{.mark}
is that of a pariah in the entertainment driven public sphere, we [must
force our voices into thepublic sphere if we are to re-contextualise
events such as the Iraq war, by]{.mark}
**[providing]{.mark}**]{.underline} audiences with [[**better, more
veracious accounts of events**.]{.underline} **[Failing this, we will
continue to find our 'defence' forces engaged in military operations
under spurious]{.underline}**]{.mark} casus belli
**[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Accordingly, despite the many
faults of his work, Baudrillard should not beforgotten. For although his
contribution was more of a slap-of-the-face than a gentlepush in the
right direction, his ideas regarding simulacra and reality have helped
to further our understanding of media spectacles (and their potential
repercussions). In apost-Baudrillard world, as social inquiry (it is to
be hoped) returns to a more empiricallyinformed understanding of the
media, we should not forget the implications posed by thiscultural
field. For if sociology seeks to explain the social world, then it must
work to prevent the dislocation of reality from the 'real' that
Baudrillard so feared.

Adam J. **Berinsky 7**, professor of political science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Assuming the Costs of War:
Events, Elites, and American Public Support for Military Conflict,"
Journal of Politics, Volume 69, Issue 4, pages 975--997, November 2007

Many political scientists and policymakers argue that unmediated
events---the successes and failures on the battlefield---determine
whether the mass public will support military excursions. The public
supports war, the story goes, if the benefits of action outweigh the
costs of conflict. Other [scholars contend that the balance of elite
discourse influences public support for war. [I draw upon survey
evidence from World War II and]{.mark} the]{.underline} current [war in
[Iraq to come to a common conclusion regarding public support for
international interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}. I find little evidence
that citizens make complex cost/benefit calculations when evaluating
military action. Instead, [[I find that patterns of elite conflict shape
opinion concerning war. When political elites **disagree as to the
wisdom of intervention, the public divides** as well. But when elites
**come to a common interpretation of a political reality**, the public
gives them **great latitude to wage war.**]{.underline}¶]{.mark} In
recent years, a charitable view of the mass public has emerged in the
public opinion and foreign policy literature. Increasingly, scholars
have attributed "rationality" to public opinion concerning war. Many
political scientists and policymakers argue that unmediated events---the
successes and failures on the battlefield---determine whether the mass
public will support military excursions. The public supports war, the
story goes, if the benefits of action outweigh the costs of conflict and
should therefore have a place at the policymaking table.¶ In this paper,
I argue that military events may shape public opinion, but not in the
straightforward manner posited by most scholars of public opinion and
war. I draw upon and expand the work of scholars who contend that the
balance of elite discourse influences levels of public support for war.
[[Integrating **research on heuristics and shortcuts** with
**information-based theories of political choice**, I demonstrate
that]{.mark}]{.underline} patterns of conflict among partisan political
actors shape mass opinion on war. It is not the direct influence of
wartime events on individual citizens\' decisions that determines public
opinion, as "event response" theories of war support claim. Instead,
consistent with the "elite cue" theory I advance in this paper, [the
nature of [conflict among political elites concerning the **salience and
meaning of**]{.mark} those **[events determines if the public will rally
to war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} To a significant degree [[citizens
determine]{.mark} their [positions]{.mark} on war [by listening to
**trusted sources**]{.mark}]{.underline}---those politicians who share
their political predispositions.¶ [I present [evidence from World War II
and the Second Iraq war, **two cases that span 65 years of American
history**]{.mark}, to come to this common conclusion.]{.underline} In
both wars, I find that significant segments of the mass public possessed
little knowledge of the most basic facts of these conflicts. Thus, there
is little evidence that citizens had the information needed to make
cost/benefit calculations when deciding whether to support or oppose
military action. Instead, [I [find that patterns of elite conflict
**shaped opinions** both **throughout**]{.mark} the six years of [World
War II and during]{.mark} the [Iraq]{.mark} conflict. [When elites come
to a **common interpretation of a political reality,** the public gives
them great latitude to wage war. But when]{.mark} prominent [political
actors take **divergent stands** on]{.mark} the wisdom of [intervention,
**the public divides**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. Furthermore, even
in cases---such as the Iraq war---where prominent political actors on
one side of the partisan divide stay silent, the presence of a prominent
partisan cue giver can lead to divergence in opinion. In sum, while
members of the mass public are not lemmings---they have agency to
determine their own opinion and may even, in the aggregate, reasonably
react to changing events---in the realm of war, any apparent rationality
arises largely through the process of elite cue taking, not through a
reasoned cost/benefit analysis. The mass public is rational only to the
extent that prominent political actors provide a rational lead.

Of course, [[it is]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}** [to
establish]{.underline}]{.mark} [definitely [the nonimpact of the antiwar
movement **on policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Doing so requires the
evaluation of **counterfactual scenarios** that cannot be tested
**empirically**]{.underline}. For example, [[if there had been
no]{.mark} antiwar [movement]{.mark} at all]{.underline} -- if nobody
had protested the war policies of the Bush Administration -- [it is
plausible to believe that [the admin]{.mark}istration [would have been
emboldened to take more aggressive **military
actions**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [possibly invading **Syria or
Iran.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Or, perhaps the Bush Administration would
have had the confidence to pursue more ambitious conservative domestic
policies. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the movement did
have these types of restraining effects but, as a social scientist, it
is impossible to demonstrate them convincingly. [[To claim]{.mark} that
the [policy]{.mark} and political [effects]{.mark} of the antiwar
movement [were limited is not to say that the movement **was
unimportant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed[, the **social effects** of
the movement may have been its most **lasting
contribution**]{.underline}. [[The antiwar movement exposed
**millions**]{.mark} of people [to]{.mark} their [first experiences
**with activism**, which will]{.mark} likely [shape the way]{.mark} that
[many]{.mark} of them [think]{.mark} of, **[and participate
in]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [politics for the **remainder of their
lives.**]{.underline}]{.mark}\[7\]

[[The movement provided critical opportunities]{.mark} for activists [to
**learn**]{.mark} **about [new tactics]{.mark}** and to implement them
on unfamiliar terrain]{.underline}.\[8\] Alliances and conflicts within
coalitions shaped the structure of the social networks of movement
participants.\[9\] [The movement provided [activists]{.mark} with
opportunities to **[explore their
identities]{.mark}**\[]{.underline}10\] [[and]{.mark} to [create new
organizations by hybridizing]{.mark} elements of
**[intersecting]{.mark}** social
**[movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[11\] In many ways, **[[we have
only begun to see]{.mark} the [long-term consequences of a generation
shaped by the antiwar movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Direct opposition to violent policies like the War on Terror is effective\-\--Debrix's critique is reductive and prevents effective resistance

6\. [[Tabloid cultures, Debrix]{.mark} seems to be
[say]{.mark}ing]{.underline}, deserve the dignity of that naming, not
just because the mass production of mediatised political subjectivities
now [[**conflate** narratives of **both**]{.mark} [the dominant and
rebel subjectivities]{.mark}, but also]{.underline} because these
[enunciate]{.underline} now [some distinctive orders of
truths]{.underline}, and theories, especially via the globally
manufactured forms of \'aesthetics\' of \'violence and by its engagement
with postmodernity.\' In a sense,\' writes Debrix, \'postmodernity now
constitutes \'a golden era of tabloid culture\' (38.) Resisting
high-minded gestures of dismissal of tabloid culture as \'trash\'
culture (6), [Debrix urges us that we take it seriously because of [the
regime of overall \'truth effects\' it produces]{.mark}, directed to
[reinforce WOT-talk]{.mark}]{.underline}. Overall, Debrix presents this
rather as a matter of mood rather than of method.¶ 8. Tabloid culture(s)
are differently technologically mediated than older forms of production
of propaganda; the new technologies of digitalization now
\'accelerate\[s\] the spiralling vortex of media-produced information\'
and images, in ways un-contemplated in earlier times (22.) [If in
earlier eras, ideology and propaganda aimed at fostering \'consistency,
certainty, and truth,\' today tabloid terror thrives rather on an
extravagant excess of the production of these \'effects\']{.underline}
(23.) [[In sum, tabloid culture/terror entails mediatised productions of
hyperreality, which provide instant justifications for the \'WOT,\'
and]{.mark} in turn [pioneer violent political truths]{.mark};
they]{.underline} overall [thus become \'a most potent resource\' for
presentations of senses of generalized panic]{.underline}.
a[s]{.underline} also for the production of the discursive effects of
nostalgia, ethnocentrism, nationhood, and other forms of sinister
\'narrative typography\' that justify annihilation of the \'monstrous\'
other or the third, in the wake of reiterated \'terror\' attacks. These
effects remain integral to production of \'mediascapesvi \' as markers
of contemporary globalization. Tabloid culture(s) celebrate the crises
of \'nervous\' rationality both for the purveyors of limitless WOT
justifications for and the arcane habitus of contemporary thoughtways,
which now speak to us via anxious discourse concerning the relation
between \'philosophy\' and \'politicsvii .\'¶ 9. Terror has its own
analytic. Contemporary \'terror\' talk often ignores Marx\'s insight in
Capital -- that the rule of law remains inconceivable outside the reign
of terror. Tabloid cultural industry and theory far from inviting any
structural grasp of \'terror\' rather invite us to a sort of
epistemological break in the name of 9/11, and its variously iterated
aftermaths. The analytic of terror thus foregrounds a particular type:
indiscriminate violence caused by nomadic suicide bombers, within and
across nations. The analytic thus formed remains ahistorical and
fragmented. Ahistorical because it ignores monumental forms of
\'terror\' historically articulated by the series of radical evils of
colonization, imperialism, and the \'Cold War,\' and because it elides
the everyday forms of lived experience of terror made visible by
critical feminist, race, and LBGT theoretical discourses8 . And
fragmented because it cannot attend to the structural violence always
fully instanced by Marxian and post-Marxian discourses.¶ 16.
Contemporary forms of \'terrorism\' should, it is often said, understood
more in terms of acts and its effects and less in those of perpetrator
intention and agency. \' The \'new\' terror consists in: \[a\] threat or
use of violence, \[b\] directed against innocent peoples, \[c\] and
further directed against others with the intention of coercing to adopt
choices or actions they would not have otherwise madeviii .\' The
\'new\' terror, under the auspices of intensely volatile and mobile
cross-border suicide bombers, is said to be different from the \'old\'
terror, which was after all an acceptable (though intensely debated)
\'political\' project (whether of revolutionary movements directed at
the overthrow of repressive regimes or the movements of
self-determination and even \'wars of national liberation\'). If the
forms of \'old\' \'terror\' thus remained integral to
transformative/emancipative praxes, the \'new\' terror remains bereft of
any such constitutive justificatory elements. If the old \'terror
wars,\' birthed a new era of contemporary human rights, and much else
besides, its new forms, in a marked contrast, are said to threaten some
of these very same hard-won civilizational/public goods. The new
\'terror\' thus remains an unmediated evil, perhaps because marked by
the suicide bomber, as an agent of unethical violence, is simply said to
\'enjoy\' itix .\'¶ 17 Justification for the \'new\' terror can be
divided into three strategies: normative, epistemological, and
cultural/political. The first demands \'good reasons,\' and both
\'good\' and \'reason\' tend to be defined differently according to the
ethical traditions one adopts. The second concerns a relationship
between belief and truth: that is, between one\'s \'belief\'s contents\'
and \'actions that arise from it.\' The third, which arises from
political psychology, cultivates practices of \'group justification\'
theories that \'hold that people are driven by ethnocentric motives to
build ingroup solidarity and to defend and justify the interests and
identities of fellow ingroup members against those of outgroup membersx
.\'¶ 18. Tabloid Terror is expressly concerned with the
cultural/political, as marking especially the tabloid culture\'s
re-articulation of some foundational triumphalist beliefs about the idea
of America. While it offers a tour de horizon of the agonal cultural
politics within the United States, it does touch upon the
epistemological questions raised by \'the primary or foundational
beliefs in America\'s \'civilizing mission,\' and its accompanying
\'sense of moral conservatism and national exceptionalism\' (65).¶ 20.
Tabloid theory accentuates the state of cultural anxieties arising out
of the very \'achievement\' of the end of the Cold War, and the fall of
the Berlin Wall. Well before 9/11, Robert Kaplan asked whether the
United States will \'survive the next century in exactly its present
form\' (50.) Kaplan wrote movingly about the shattering of the \'dreams
of the Cold War\' through the emergence of an \'epoch of themeless
juxtapositions, in which the classificatory grid of nation-states will
be replaced by a jagged-glass pattern of city-states, shanty-states,
nebulous and anarchic regionalisms and a \'new kind of war,\' wars of
\'communal survival, aggravated or, in many cases, caused by
environmental scarcity,\' wars which \'will be sub-national, meaning
that it will be hard for states and local governments to protect their
own citizens physically. This is how many states will ultimately diexi
.\' Samuel Huntington followed suit with his own \'neoconservative
cultural anxiety,\' fully manifest in his fulsome and fierce critique of
multiculturalism and serial attacks upon \'America\'s lifestyle.\' His
American \'civilizing mission\' entailed \'cultural renewal\' not just
for itself but as a vanguard movement aimed at keeping\' the Western
bloc Western,\' regaining in the process \'geostrategic control over
international relations\' thus also fostering \'a sense of Western
alliance, complicity, and common interest\' (58.) Not to be left behind,
Zbigniew Brzezinski passionately pleads for a revitalization of the
\'Eurasian chessboard\' (signifying here some narratives of the newly
industrializing developing societies, inclusive of China and India) as a
geographical and epistemic \'buffer\' to allow a fecund scope for the
United States not only to remain \'unique and superior\' but also to
violently \'span the entire surface of the globe\' (63.)¶ 21. The
survivalist imperative for the United States led directly to the quest
for a diffuse and fiercer enemy, commencing its anxious itinerary
(37-67) well before 9/11. The \'sense of moral conservatism and national
exceptionalism\' (65) was necessary but not sufficient for a triumphal
reassertion of America\'s \'civilizing mission.\' In a tragic irony,
Osama Bin Laden and his lieutenants performed a singular service to the
reinvention of this mission, creating a new geopolitics of solidarity
manifest in WOT discourse as an event. Debrix describes this (not
avoiding the embedded racist and sexist narratives), as a \'swirling
black hole\' contributing to \'a destructive fatality\' for an ideology
of an absolute superiority of the West over the rest of the world\'
(111.)¶ 21. Debrix suggests that productions of tabloid theory and
culture render fungible the states, and estates, of the normative
regimes of international law, international humanitarian, and human
rights law/jurisprudence. Tabloid terror productions seem to have no
\'use\' for all these normative formats. He is correct that they are
besieged by an ethic of ambiguity, even to a point of rendering
illegible the normative proscriptions against killing/harming \'innocent
non-combatant civiliansxii .\' The WOT tabloid discourse thrives upon a
constitution of corresponding normative/ontological \'lack\'. Because
the new \'terror warriors,\' in any event, lie outside these normative
regimes governing hostile acts between and betwixt state actors,
recognized as proper subjects of international law, and civil war type
insurgency actors as well, the WOT constitutes (to invoke Agamben) a
\'zone of indistinction,\' or (to evoke the phrase regime of
international lawpersons) \'a regime of non liquet\', situations where
the normativity of international law provides neither any scope of
formulating a problematique, nor any response to it. Thus it comes to
pass that in a new medievalism of WOT enact some instant rhetoric of a
new lex talonis.¶ 22. [[Debrix allows **no narrative space** for]{.mark}
marked [differences within-Euroamerican WOT talk]{.mark},
nor]{.underline} does he [refer to global South-based
critique.]{.underline} In Chapter 5, [Debrix extends a]{.underline}
Lyotard-inflected [Kantian \'sublime\' to \'the tabloid aesthetics of
violence and the **erasure of the event.\'**]{.underline} [[Debrix
locates]{.mark} the sublime [as]{.mark} a]{.underline} \'principal
operating [[technique\' by which]{.underline}]{.mark} tabloid [[cultural
productions reduce]{.mark} the frightening experience of a sublime
[event]{.mark}]{.underline} (the spectacles of terror in New York,
Madrid, London, and now Mumbai) **[[\'toward a]{.mark}
[concept]{.mark},]{.underline}** another **[belief,
[or]{.mark}]{.underline}** an **[[exercise of
reason]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that is]{.underline} finally [[**able to
impose its dominant truth** as]{.underline}]{.mark} it were the
prevailing everyday [[reality\']{.underline}]{.mark} (126.) Debrix\'s
tales of (American) tabloid culture presenting the domestication of the
sublime as an integral aspect of a \'regime of truth ... equipped with
its arsenal of inclusions and exclusions\' (127) are persuasive, but the
further claim that the WOT aesthetic may yet offer some \'differential
possibilities for democracy in contemporary geopolitics and
international relations\' (127) is never fully spelled out.¶ 23.
[[Debrix\'s category of the \'trivial sublime\'
**poses**]{.underline}]{.mark} similar
**[[problems]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To explain it, he narrates [the
[protest]{.mark} of Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a marine killed in
Iraq]{.underline}, outside President George Walker\'s Bush\'s ranch in
Texas (and subsequently joined my many mothers of soldiers and veterans
of the Iraq war) as exemplary of the \'trivial sublime.\' Sheehan\'s
fasting serves as an \'irruptive event\' which commands (media)
attention in ways that \'brings haunting reality backing the face of
those who champion a higher idea, ideal, and ideology\' (141); yet it
[[is trivially sublime]{.underline}]{.mark} (according to Florian
Tréguer, whose analysis Debrix adopts) [because it opens \'into
nothing]{.underline},\' because it lacks \'conceptual horizon or an
\'ideological depth\', [and [because it does not question]{.mark} the
\'daily and ordinary **[reality]{.mark}**,]{.underline} where
individuals die violent deaths as a result of the American agony of
war\' (142). The US Iraq war mothers\' \'protest is trivially sublime
because it remains \'without future and hope\' (141) and keeps intact
\'American war machine\'s terror\' (142.) The protest \'shocks and
destabilizes,\' without at the same moment \'providing answers\' or
\'bringing in new hopes\' (143-44 ) toward an actualization of
\'democracy-to-come.\' **[[If this is the case, how may counter-publics
ever re-script the]{.mark} \'sublime [spectatorship of]{.mark} the
[Iraq]{.mark} War\']{.underline}** (129-136) **[[and]{.mark} indeed of
[the]{.mark} variously ongoing [WOT]{.mark}?]{.underline}**¶ 24.
**[[Contra Debrix]{.mark},]{.underline}** on [[my]{.underline}]{.mark}
relatively untutored [[readings]{.underline}]{.mark} of, Slavoj Zižek,
Jean-Luc Nancy, and Jacques Derrida (137-140) [[suggest]{.mark} that
[resistance]{.mark} events **[may after all]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[push the frontiers of tabloid cultures and even [present an

]{.mark}**political or democratic [success\']{.mark}**]{.underline} [in
American]{.underline} popular/public [culture of
representations]{.underline} of a different future to come\' (141).
[[Tabloid terror]{.mark} productions [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} thus
the registers of dramaturgies of the WOT desires sublimating orders/
disorders of deferred desires: desires as constituting a Lecanian lack,
[[a site of hyper- reality where]{.mark} the future delineating [acts of

talk about the future of democracy-to-come may make for any narrative of
the spectatorship of the sublime except via the endless return of the
same: violent exchanges between and amongst the cadres of suicide
bombers trained and equipped by the \'masters of terror\' on the one
hand and, on the other hand, the predatory violence of the

#### Baudrillard's critique [does not]{.underline} generalize to the thesis that [all]{.underline} information-production is pure spectacle 

Patrick **Wilcken 95** Department of Anthropology, Goldsmiths' College,
University of London "The Intellectuals, the Media and the Gulf War"
Critique of Anthropology 1995 15: 37

There are strong links between the theoretical meanderings described
above and intellectuals' response to an event like the Gulf War. The 'no
comment' approach was perhaps the most widespread in keeping with an
indifferent critical climate, but for those who put their oar in,
agnosticism was the order of the day.
[[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, in his infamous article
'The Reality Gulf' (1991a) written on the eve of hostilities, [claimed
that the war would not in fact take place. By this he [meant]{.mark}
that [the media had created a 'hyper real scenario' of fallacious
commentary]{.mark}, empty predictions [and reports of threats and
counterthreats that were **staged for the media in the first
place**]{.mark}. In Baudrillard's opinion, [the only real 'strategic
cite is the TV screen]{.mark}]{.underline} from which we are daily
bombarded'. [**[There is no other reality]{.mark}**; images and their
referents are interchangeable]{.underline}. As a result we have on our
hands, under the auspices of the UN as an 'extended contraceptive', a
'Safe War' (like safe sex) - 'a form of war which means never having to
face up to war' (1991a: 25).

[[Baudrillard's piece as a description of the way the media
worked]{.mark} during the crisis [holds]{.mark} some
[validity]{.mark}]{.underline},&dquo; [[but **to go from there** and
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**[taking any position on]{.mark}
such [an event]{.mark}** [by attempting to demystify the media
'simulacrum' is]{.mark} simply [mistaken]{.mark}]{.underline} - in
effect [[just one more illusory exercise]{.underline} - **[is absurd to
say the least]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Baudrillard's second article
published in Liberation (1991b) entitled 'La guerre du Golfe n'a pas eu
lieu' ('The Gulf War Did Not Take Place') goes even further in this
direction. [[Baudrillard is willing to concede]{.mark} that in the event
[mass destruction did take place, but he goes on to argue]{.mark} that
**[we must not be deceived into taking a moral stand]{.mark} on such an
issue**, [but must instead engage in]{.mark} a sort of [postmodern
oneupmanship and **reject all evidence so as to be 'more virtual than
the events themselves'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (trans. in Norris, 1992:
194).

Baudrillard's position is perhaps somewhat extreme, but its
controversial avant-garde flavour assured it copy space. But similar
sentiments dressed up differently begin to look disturbingly
representative of the intellectual response in the media when one
considers Michael Ignatieff's article in the Observer (1991). 'The
languages of moral concern hardly connect,' writes Ignatieff. Some
people decry the carnage on the road to Basra, others, like Ignatieff
himself, support the war on the grounds that sanctions would have
failed. But in the final analysis 'neither side has the slightest hope
of convincing the other' . What kind of critical commentary is this?
Ignatieff's relativist stance renders informed debate irrelevant and
absolves him from having to defend his pro-war position.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Barbara Ehrenreich (one of Garafola's
new generation public intellectuals) in an article for Time magazine
(1990), 'The Warrior Culture', attributes the eagerness of the US to
confront the Iraqis militarily to America's culture of aggression. She
starts off with a sort of Victorian anthropological chamber of horrors:
dozens of 'pretechnological peoples' including the Masai of East Africa
and the North American Plains Indians rule that men cannot marry until
they have killed in battle; in the Solomon Islands a chief's status is
reckoned by the number of skulls displayed around his door; Aztec kings
use human hearts in religious rituals. America possesses just such a
'warrior culture' with its unquenchable thirst for violence on
television, its willingness to go to war on any pretext, and its warrior
elite siphoning off nearly a third of the federal budget even in peace
time. While left-wingers may blame this war on imperialism, Ehrenreich
concludes, and right-wingers 'internationalism' the real villain is in
the culture itself.

Ehrenreich's well-intentioned piece not only fails to convince
ethnographically but, reducing international politics to culture,
eliminates the possibility of dissent. Ehrenreich is arguing in effect,
that Americans are unable to help themselves: their culture inculcates
them with the urge to fight. Historical precedent, economic
considerations and global power relations become irrelevant.

[[These]{.mark} three [public intellectuals]{.mark}, highly visible in
their respective countries, [are unable to assess critically a major
political event like the Gulf War. Baudrillard wants to live in 'virtual
reality']{.mark}]{.underline}, Ignatieff concludes that any adjudication
is impossible and Ehrenreich reduces the conflict to specious cultural
predispositions. Their lack of conviction, though, owes as much to the
theoretical climate as to the requirements of the media. Baudrillard's
piece satisfies the market for the bizarre - the intellectual eccentric
going over the top; Ignatieff encapsulates the views of the soft liberal
readership of the Observer; while Ehrenreich's article has obvious
exotic appeal.

[But even outside the requirements of the media, [the Gulf War
highlighted the general paralysis of the intellectual community]{.mark}
worldwide. In the USA, Edward Said argues that [intellectuals failed to
join the debate because of their lack of 'affiliation with the public
sphere']{.mark}]{.underline}, provinciality and impotence (1991: 15).
Even the editorial board of Dissent was divided over the issue,
producing a wide spectrum of opinion. Todd Gitlin described the war as a
'catastrophe' which was 'avoidable', the late Irving Howe felt compelled
to take a pro-war position but felt that the stance was 'uncomfortable'
for the Left, while Dennis Wrong concluded that because of the UN's role
this was a 'legal and just war' (Morton et al., 1991:153-60). In France
ex-radical 'soixante huitard' Alaine Touraine gave the war his
unequivocal support, while Pierre Bourdieu denounced it as 'drunken
war-mongering' (Zamiti, 1992 : 53 ; author's trans.). In Britain,
Christopher Norris comments that few intellectuals were able to resist
the 'pressures of ideological recruitment' (1992: 25) and The Times, in
an article written during the conflict, described the 'old constituency
of intellectual protest' as 'in confusion' (27 January 1991). But
perhaps the most striking example of intellectual disarray was in
Germany, where the issue of the war was the first event to break up
decisively one of the most politically cohesive left-wing groups in
Europe. Veterans of 1968 Enzensberger and Brumlik came out in support of
the Allies as other intellectuals appeared to flounder in
self-contradiction: Jurgen Habermas commented that the war was
'justified' (as opposed to 'just'); Cohn-Bendit supported the war while
at the same time condemned the hypocrisy of the intellectuals for
ignoring the suffering of the Iraqi people (Rabinbach, 1991 : 462).

Kim **Sawchuk 2**, PhD, Social and Political Thought, York University,
prof of comm at Concordia, editor of the Canadian Journal of
Communication, general book review of Distant Suffering by Luc
Boltanski, Canadian journal of Communication Vol 27, No 1 (2002)

[[Inherent]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [politics of pity]{.underline} in
the modern period [[is]{.mark} the [problem of dealing with suffering
from a distance]{.mark}]{.underline} and the \"massification of a
collection of unfortunates who are not there in person\" (p. 13).
[Although contemporary media may have \"dramatized\" the spectacle of
distant suffering]{.underline} in the past 30 years, **[they neither
invented nor caused this condition.]{.underline}** Historical examples
also bolster Boltanski\'s claim that the media did not inaugurate the
politics of pity - rather, its logic was set out more than 200 years
ago. Boltanski carefully examines this logic and the paradoxes it
creates in the book\'s three sections. Part 1 lays out the argument.
Part 2 relies heavily on literary sources to analyze the \"topos,\" a
term he borrows from rhetoric, of the idea of pity and suffering. The
third section deals with the question of pity and misfortune, drawing
primarily on historical and contemporary examples, such as the work of
Doctors Without Borders and the clash in the late 1950s between Sartre
and Merleau-Ponty. Each chapter is replete with insight, making this a
difficult book to summarize. Every word and every argument is so
intricately intertwined with the next that paraphrasing seems a
travesty.¶ The third section should be of interest to those located in
the disciplines of communications or media studies. Here it is important
to recall the subtitle of the book, Morality, the Media and Politics.
[Boltanski returns to the question of the spectator and the anxieties of
those who wish to do something about what they see unfolding on their
screens]{.underline}. He asks: \"\[H\]ow might the contemporary
spectators\' anxiety be reduced without averting their gaze from
misfortune or by abandoning the project inherent in the modern
definition of politics of facing up to unnecessary suffering and
relieving it\[?\]\" (p. 159). [[What could political action be, given
the fact that suffering does occur at a distance and that not every
struggle can be taken on with equal commitment]{.underline}]{.mark}?
First, he argues that **[there is a political, technical, and moral
necessity to open up a discussion of commitment and ideology, although
what he means by ideology is not adequately explained.]{.underline}**
Second, he contends that witnessing suffering means that morally we are
asked to act. **[Commitment is commitment to some kind of
action]{.underline}**. Third, **[he promotes the idea that [speech is
action. \"One can commit]{.mark} oneself through speech;]{.underline}**
**[[by taking a stance]{.mark}, even when alone, of someone who speaks
to somebody else about what they have seen\"]{.underline}** (p. xv).
**[[By speaking - to others]{.underline}]{.mark}** and even to oneself
**[- [we recognize]{.mark} and acknowledge [that speech must be
understood as a form of action]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 154).¶ One of
the conditions of Boltanski\'s argument is a clear distinction between
the world of representation and the world of action. He writes:
\"Informed by representation, words must really be deployed in the world
of action in order to be effective\" (p. 154). **[He is critical
of]{.underline}** deconstructionist criticism, primarily meaning the
writings of Jean **[[Baudrillard]{.mark}, which [blurs this distinction
to too great an extreme]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby
**[\"[holding]{.mark} the order of [action\" at arm\'s length]{.mark} or
making it illusionary]{.underline}** (p. 154). He contends that [this
position makes the very intention to act nothing but a naïve illusion
creating an \"empire of suspicion\"]{.underline} (p. 158). Boltanski
does not claim that we remain without an emotional commitment to causes,
but rather that \"to prevent the unacceptable drift of emotions close
towards the fictional **[we must maintain an orientation towards action,
a disposition to act, even if this is only by speaking out in support of
the unfortunate\"]{.underline}** (p. 153).¶ What then are the properties
of effective speech? Boltanski turns to phenomenology and semantics,
concluding that effective speech involves: (a) intentionality; (b)
incorporation in bodily gestures and movements; (c) sacrifice of other
possible actions; (d) the presence of others; and, (e) a commitment (p.
185). Intentionality involves an intention to speak meaningfully, not
just engage in idle chatter. Action and intention are connected to each
other in effective action realized in the world. Intention incorporated
in action is \"expression.\" This kind of expressive political speech
must involve risk for spectators - they may be chastized, they may be
contested, or they may be at physical risk in authoritarian regimes.
Boltanski goes on to classify different types of action as strong and
weak, collective and individual. He builds an argument for local
chapters of groups supporting humanitarian movements, such as Amnesty
International, for they enable one to avoid the alternative of either
on-the-spot involvement or distant spectacle. They are one way to breach
the schism between abstract universalism and communitarian withdrawal:
\"The humanitarian claim for more or less distant causes can thus avoid
the alternative of abstract universalism - easily accused of being fired
up for distant suffering the better to avert its eyes from those close
at hand - or of communitarian withdrawal into itself - which only
attends to misfortune when it affects those nearest - by being rooted in
groups and thereby linked to preexisting solidarities and local
interests\" (p. 190). In other words, expression is most \"authentic\"
for Boltanski when made manifest in actions, like participating in a
demonstration or protest, which incarnates our beliefs and displays our
commitments. By incorporating an action, the person communicates an
observable tendency.¶ But is this enough? Boltanski is **[[concerned by
apathy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and asks us to consider that we are
doomed, inevitably, to imperfection in our politics. Despite this,
**[[we must make the attempt to be]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"moral
subjects\" - that is, **[[committed and engaged
subjects.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Because he recognizes the difficulties
of negotiating these contradictions, he avoids moralizing. He is no
Habermasian trying to outline the conditions for an ideal-speech
situation. In Boltanski\'s book, **[[we live in imperfect worlds and we
must contend with this.]{.underline}]{.mark}** He [asks that **we
resurrect compassion into our politics**,]{.underline}
[which]{.underline} he says **[is always particular and practical, as it
is oriented toward doing something about a situation]{.underline}**.
Unlike pity, it engages with the person suffering**[.]{.underline}** But
pity isn\'t always a bad thing in this analysis. Pity generalizes in
order to deal with distance, and in so doing one may discover emotion
and feeling for others that may translate into speech or action. [A
[spectacle of suffering may end with a commitment to
involvement.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ Boltanski realizes the challenge, yet
[remains optimistic that humans are capable of such a move]{.underline}.
There are, as he notes, an \"excess of unfortunates\" in our world. The
problem remains to whom we extend aid or pity, given their great numbers
(p. 155). This is true both in the realm of action, but also in the
realm of representation. So many people are suffering and there is not
enough media space for them all (p. 155). Boltanski does not prioritize
causes or instances of grief. He does, however, suggest that the media
represent any unfortunate groups taking action to confront and escape
their distress. It is unethical to only depict them in the passive act
of suffering (p. 190). He acknowledges that the mediatization of
suffering may incite action. For example, it may protect populations
against their own rulers, if only temporarily, for such depictions do
not necessarily change the internal political situation. His analysis
assumes that spectators, who are **[democratic citizens, have a role to
play in lobbying and pressuring their own governments to take
action]{.underline}** (p. 184). Again, while aware that public opinion
may be manipulated, he argues that public-opinion polls are powerful
tools. Answering a poll is depicted as a potentially effective form of
speech and an \"adequate response to the call for action\" (p. 185).¶
Distant Suffering thus describes, in sometimes painful detail, a
[wavering between selfish egoism and [altruistic commitment to
causes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Boltanski describes how we may,
unfortunately, cultivate ourselves by becoming absorbed in our own pity
when looking at the spectacle of someone else\'s suffering, a phenomenon
that has been far too present since the September 11 bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York. Boltanski **[[tries to lead us out
of]{.mark} this [self-absorption into the world of effective political
action]{.mark} by [offering a range of
involvement.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While advocating commitment and
debates about morality as part of the solution, this is no smug
celebration of the \"return to kindness\" or an easy denunciation of the
perverse delight of spectacles of suffering. In considering distant
suffering as the \"logical consequence\" of the introduction of pity
into politics over 200 years ago, we are asked to concern ourselves with
the present.¶ Boltanski ends his fine treatise by exhorting us to quit
looking to past injustices, to stop anticipating future injustice, and
to stay focused on the present. \"[To be concerned with the present is
no small matter]{.underline}. For over the past, ever gone by, and over
the future, still non-existent, [the present has an overwhelming
privilege: [that]{.mark} of being real]{.underline}\" (p. 192). Naive?
Perhaps. Boltanski does not provide simple or quick answers to the
dilemma, but leaves one with the hope that pity might [**[lead to
compassion, commitment, and social change -]{.underline}** [even if such
measures do not end all suffering]{.underline}]{.mark} [once and
for]{.underline} all. As such, this translation from the original French
text is a welcome addition to contemporary debates in political
communication.

#### Prefer utilitarian approaches to policy that cast aside qualitative assessments \-\-- valuing how discussions make us feel rather than the truth of the discussion ensures disastrous decision-making 

**Bloom 14** \[Paul Bloom, Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor of
Psychology & Cognitive Science at Yale University, "Against Empathy,
Boston Review, September 13, 2014,
<http://bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy>\]

When asked what I am working on, I often say [I am writing a book about
[empathy]{.mark}]{.underline}. People tend to smile and nod, and then I
add, "**[[I'm against it]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This usually gets an
uncomfortable laugh.

This reaction surprised me at first, but I've come to realize that
taking a position against empathy is like announcing that you hate
kittens---a statement so outlandish it can only be a joke. And so I've
learned to clarify, to explain that I am not against morality,
compassion, kindness, love, being a good neighbor, doing the right
thing, and making the world a better place. My claim is actually the
opposite: if you want to be good and do good, empathy is a poor guide.

The word "[empathy]{.underline}" is used in many ways, but here I am
adopting its most common meaning, which corresponds to what
eighteenth-century philosophers such as Adam Smith called "sympathy." It
[refers to the process of experiencing the world as others do, or at
least as you think they do. To empathize with someone is to put yourself
in her shoes, to feel her pain]{.underline}. Some researchers also use
the term to encompass the more coldblooded process of assessing what
other people are thinking, their motivations, their plans, what they
believe. This is sometimes called "cognitive," as opposed to
"emotional," empathy. I will follow this convention here, but we should
keep in mind that the two are distinct---they emerge from different
brain processes; you can have a lot of one and a little of the
other---and that [most of the discussion of the moral implications of
empathy focuses on its emotional side]{.underline}.

[Some degree of emotional empathy is bred in the bone. The sight and
sound of another's suffering is unpleasant for babies]{.underline} and,
as soon as they are mobile enough, [they try to help, patting and
soothing others in distress.]{.underline} This is not uniquely human:
the primatologist Frans de Waal notes that chimps will often put their
arms around the victim of an attack and pat her or groom her.

[Empathy can occur automatically, even involuntarily]{.underline}. Smith
describes how "persons of delicate fibres" who notice a beggar's sores
and ulcers "are apt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the
correspondent part of their own bodies." John Updike writes, "My
grandmother would have choking fits at the kitchen table, and my own
throat would feel narrow in sympathy."

And [empathy can be extended through the imagination]{.underline}. In a
speech before he became president, Barack Obama stressed how important
it is

to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from
us---the child who's hungry, the steelworker who's been laid off, the
family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came
to town. . . . When you think like this---when you choose to broaden
your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether
they are close friends or distant strangers---it becomes harder not to
act, harder not to help.

Obama is right about this last part; there is considerable support for
what the psychologist C. Daniel Batson calls "the empathy-altruism
hypothesis": when you empathize with others, you are more likely to help
them. In general, empathy serves to dissolve the boundaries between one
person and another; it is a force against selfishness and indifference.

It is easy to see, then, how empathy can be a moral good, and it has
many champions. Obama talks frequently about empathy; witness his recent
claim, after his first meeting with Pope Francis, that "it's the lack of
empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the
lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets."
In The Empathetic Civilization (2009) Jeremy Rifkin argues that the only
way our species will survive war, environmental degradation, and
economic collapse is through the enhancement of "global empathy." This
past June, Bill and Melinda Gates concluded their Stanford commencement
address by asking students to nurture and expand their empathetic
powers, essential for a better world.

Most people see the benefits of empathy as akin to the evils of racism:
too obvious to require justification. I think this is a mistake. I have
argued elsewhere that [certain [features]{.mark} of empathy [make it a
poor guide to]{.mark} social [policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Empathy
is biased]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [[we]{.mark} are more prone to
[feel]{.mark} empathy for [attractive people and]{.mark} for [those who
look like us]{.mark} or share our ethnic or national
background]{.underline}. And [[empathy is narrow]{.underline}]{.mark};
[[it]{.mark} connects]{.underline} [us to particular individuals, real
or imagined, but [is **insensitive to numerical differences and
statistical data**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Mother Teresa put
it, "If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I
will." Laboratory studies find that [we really do care more about the
one than]{.underline} [about the mass, so long as we have personal
information about the one]{.underline}.

In light of these features, **[[our public decisions will be]{.mark}
fairer and [more moral once we put empathy aside]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Our **[policies are]{.mark} [improved when we appreciate that a hundred
deaths are worse than one]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even if we know the
name of the one, [and when we]{.mark}]{.underline} [[acknowledge]{.mark}
that [the life of someone in a faraway country is worth as much as the
life a neighbor]{.mark}, [even if our emotions pull us in a
different]{.mark} [direction]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Without
empathy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[we]{.mark} are [better]{.mark} able
to [grasp the importance of vaccinating children]{.mark} and responding
to climate change]{.underline}**. [[These]{.mark} acts [impose costs on
real people]{.mark} in the here and now [for the sake of **abstract
future benefits**]{.mark}, so [tackling them]{.mark} **[may require
overriding empathetic responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[that
favor the comfort and well-being of individuals today]{.underline}. [[We
can rethink]{.mark} humanitarian]{.underline} [aid and the [criminal
justice]{.mark} system, [choosing to draw on a
reasoned]{.mark}]{.underline}, even
**[[counter-empathetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[analysis of]{.mark}
moral obligation and likely [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Extinction outweighs\-\--our framing [shifts security policy]{.underline} from a [national]{.underline} to [existential]{.underline} frame\-\--solves their threat K's

Nathan **Sears 20**, PhD Candidate in Political Science at The
University of Toronto and Trudeau Fellow in Peace, Conflict and Justice
at the Munk School of Global Affairs, 4/17/20, "Existential Security:
Towards a Security Framework for the Survival of Humanity,"
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12800

[Humanity's **capacity for self‐destruction**]{.underline} [poses a
**radically different problematique for security policy:**]{.underline}
[survival interdependence]{.underline} . [Survival interdependence means
that the survival of human societies on one side of the
world]{.underline} **[increasingly depends]{.underline}** [on the
(in)action of human societies on the other]{.underline}. For most of
history, human societies -- clans, tribes, city‐states, empires, and
nation states -- could seek security irrespective of the security of
other societies; but today **[no single nation state]{.underline}** [can
solve the biggest security problems of the times on their
own]{.underline}, **[nor]{.underline}** in many cases [can they hope to
escape their security consequences]{.underline}. [Humankind is becoming
ever more tied together as a **single 'security unit'**]{.underline}.
The forces behind this process are not political -- indeed,
international politics remains stubbornly committed to 'national
security' -- but material (Deudney, 2007, 2018), especially certain
human‐driven trends in technology and the environment that could
threaten humanity with destruction. Security policy must take into
account the significance of these changes. Thus, [a **new security
framework** is required]{.underline}.

**[['Existential security']{.underline}]{.mark}** [responds to a similar
set of questions as]{.underline} **[alternative security
frames]{.underline}** (see Table 2). **[Security for
whom?]{.underline}** [The **['referent object']{.mark}** of existential
security [is **humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Security]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[about]{.mark} **[humanity's
survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} . **[Security for which
values?]{.underline}** [The 'values' to be secured are]{.underline}, at
the minimum, [the survival of humanity]{.underline} (i.e. [the
**biological entity** of the human species and **cultural entity** of
human civilization]{.underline}), and, at the maximum, the long‐term
prosperity of human civilization and the planet. [The security of
humankind ranges from the survival of existing human beings and
societies to past and future generations of humanity -- the **past whose
memory is recorded in history and preserved by the present**, and the
future whose possibilities of existence depend on actions taken in the
present]{.underline}. **[Existential security]{.underline}** therefore
[[adopts an **intergenerational perspective**]{.mark} of
security]{.underline}, **[[not only for utilitarian
reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([e.g. quantifying the potential
gains/losses in 'future lives']{.underline}) (Baum, 2015; Bostrom, 2002,
2013; Torres, 2017), [but [also because **the significance of
humankind**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is, [all its **past
sufferings**, **present achievements**, and **future
potential**]{.underline} -- [[is at stake]{.underline}]{.mark}, [since
existential risks simultaneously threaten humanity's past, present, and
future]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1961).

**[How much security?]{.underline}** [Nick Bostrom]{.underline} (2013,
p. 19) [proposes the principle of 'maxipok']{.underline}, [in which
security policy would seek to 'maximise the probability of an "OK
outcome"]{.underline}, [where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids
existential catastrophe']{.underline}. [While reducing the probability
of existential risk to 'zero' may]{.underline} [be
impossible]{.underline}, [the amount of security should be determined by
a level of risk‐aversion equivalent to existential threats]{.underline}.
[Since thinking in terms of 'worst‐case scenarios' is a common practice
in the security domain]{.underline}, [and since some **['worst‐case
scenarios']{.mark}** could include civilizational collapse or human
extinction]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} [should imply a **strong
aversion to risk**]{.underline}. [Although there are logical limits to
the 'precautionary principle' with respect to existential
risks]{.underline},10 [it [has **practical**]{.mark}
**[implications]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
security [[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as
taking]{.underline}]{.mark} preventive, cost‐effective, and
**[[long‐term oriented action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clarke, 2005).
More generally, [[making]{.mark} (existential) [security a]{.mark}
[priority **does not**]{.mark} **imply the [sacrifice]{.mark} of all
[other values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. political liberty, economic
wealth), **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** it [[does
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that [potential **[gains]{.mark} in other
values** [be weighed against]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[potential
losses]{.mark} in security]{.underline}**. [Security is always a
question of degree]{.underline} (Wolfers, 1952).

**[From what threats?]{.underline}** [Existential security is [concerned
with]{.mark} those [threats that have]{.mark} their [**origins in human
agency** and could bring about]{.mark} civilizational collapse or human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires broadening the security
agenda beyond its conventional focus on 'security from violence', while
excluding 'natural' existential risks (e.g. asteroids and
supervolcanos). [There are two main reasons for emphasizing
anthropogenic threats]{.underline}. [The first is the low probability of
natural risks on **timescales relevant to humanity**]{.underline}
(Bostrom, 2013; Bostrom and Cirkovic, 2008;), [whereas anthropogenic
threats are, by definition, relevant to human timescales]{.underline},
[including the twenty‐first century]{.underline} (Rees, 2003). The
second is that many prevention/mitigation strategies for anthropogenic
existential threats act on their drivers in human agency, which makes
little sense for natural risks. [The spectrum of anthropogenic
existential threats includes threats to international peace and
security]{.underline} (**[[e.g. nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[dangers from human intervention in the natural environment]{.underline}
(**[e.g. [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**), [[and]{.mark} risks
from emerging technologies]{.underline} (**[e.g.
[AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**). [Existential security must take into
account the complex relationships between human, environmental, and
technological systems, as well as inherent uncertainties about
existential threat scenarios]{.underline} (e.g. 'nuclear winter',
'hothouse Earth', or 'superintelligence').

**[By what means and modes of protection?]{.underline}** [The
existential security frame requires innovation in the means and modes of
security policy]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} the **[conventional emphasis]{.underline}** [on
military capabilities and balancing is either inadequate]{.underline}
(e.g. nuclear war), [irrelevant]{.underline} (e.g. climate change), [or
counterproductive]{.underline} (e.g. AI). Moreover, the [pursuit of
**relative gains/losses** in security is fundamentally
misguided]{.underline} for anthropogenic existential threats, since --
as a general principle -- [either all human societies are safe, or none
of them are]{.underline}. Existential security requires a paradigm shift
from thinking about security policy as a matter of (national) 'defense'
to being a matter of (global) 'governance'. [Governance is **not an end
in itself**]{.underline} (e.g. the creation of a 'world state'),
**[but]{.underline}** [rather **a means to security**]{.underline} (i.e.
**[the survival of humankind]{.underline}**). [The pursuit of
existential security requires means of protection that involve a
comprehensive set of political, economic, and technological resources --
not merely military capabilities]{.underline}. The **[modes of
protection]{.underline}** [are primarily **'restraint'** and
**'resilience'**]{.underline}. Restraint is a prevention strategy, while
resilience is a mitigation strategy, which take on different forms for
different threats. [For the]{.underline} [nuclear threat]{.underline},
[restraint manifests itself in the policies of **disarmament**, **arms
control**, and nonproliferation]{.underline}, while resilience comes
mostly in the form of nuclear bunkers and shelters (Bull, 1961; Deudney,
2007). [For climate change]{.underline}, [restraint is]{.underline}
primarily [about limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the degradation
of carbon sinks, while resilience is about making societies less
vulnerable to heat stress, rising seas, food and water scarcities, new
diseases, and human migration]{.underline} (Wallace‐Wells, 2019; World
Bank, 2012). For AI, restraint entails the slow and careful development
of AI (Bostrom, 2014) -- or perhaps forgoing the 'AI dream' altogether
(Joy, 2000) -- while resilience is about reducing societal vulnerability
to technological disruption (e.g. cybersecurity). Importantly, the
growing survival interdependence of human societies implies that
restraint and resilience must be mutual to be effective. If only some
states choose disarmament or nonproliferation, if some societies reduce
carbon emissions while others increase them, or if one technology firm
decides to rapidly pursue 'superintelligence', then the (in)action of
some actors may affect the security of all humankind. This emphasis on
mutual restraint and resilience [**contrasts** with the **national
security frame\'s** emphasis on **'self‐help'**]{.underline}.

### at: death k (robinson)

#### Their assertion that "modern society is premised upon the exclusion of the dead" is ungrounded mysticism that fetishizes death as a truly authentic experience 

**Noys 5** \[Benjamin, BSc, MA, DPhil, Professor of Critical Theory at
the University of Chichester, *The Culture of Death*, Berg: New York, NY
(2005), p. 24-27\]

[For Baudrillard this eclipse of symbolic exchange also affected our
relationship with death. As symbolic exchange is destroyed]{.underline},
including our exchanges with the dead, so 'little by little, [**the dead
cease to exist**']{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1993: 126).
[Once]{.underline} [we had exchanges with the dead, we traded or
bargained with them]{.underline}, or made offerings to them. This
extends to practices like the Irish wake, when a party would be held
while the body of the dead was still in the house to celebrate the life
of the deceased. Now, the dead are excluded, we remove them as rapidly
as possible to be buried or cremated and mourning rituals have also been
curtailed. Baudrillard argues that we can never completely eliminate
symbolic exchange or our dealings with the dead. The more we try to
exclude the dead the more they return in traumatic forms. Perhaps the
modern fashion for zombie films, such as the trilogy of George A.
Romero, Night of the Living Dead (1969), Dawn of the Dead (1979) and Day
of the Dead (1985), is a sign of this? What is interesting is that in
the second film of the trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, the zombies invade
that bastion of capitalist culture the shopping mall (although they seem
strangely pacified by the muzak!). What is also interesting is that this
film is the one from the trilogy that has recently been remade. In a
sense death takes its revenge on us as, for Baudrillard, death can never
be fully programmed or contained by the postmodern society of images.
[The dead resist the process of exchange and cannot be fully integrated
into the capitalist economy.]{.underline} This is despite the fact that,
as Nancy Mitford pointed out in her 1963 book The American Way of Death
(1998), a scathing exposé of funeral home practices, there is a great
deal of money to be made in the funeral business. [Baudrillard
emphasised that this return of the dead would force us to rediscover
symbolic exchange or we would be left with a culture that had become
terminal. Either we deal with the dead through symbolic exchange, or we
become the living dead]{.underline}, like the zombie consumers of Dawn
of the Dead. His work is almost a parody of those radical thinkers of
the 1960s who tried to find resistance in those who could not be
integrated into the system, whether that was women, students, lesbians
and gays, petty criminals or African-Americans. It seems as if, for
Baudrillard, the dead are the only ones who cannot be integrated! [The
problem with [his model]{.mark} is that it [offers **no real
explanation** for why death comes to invade our whole
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[His idea of a radical
reversal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[when what is excluded returns]{.mark}
in a more virulent form, [is **extremely hard to pin down**]{.mark}
**[concretely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[This leaves his argument
ungrounded]{.underline}]{.mark}** and it is no surprise that it has been
greeted with scepticism. In comparison, whatever criticisms we might
want to make of it, Agamben's analysis of our exposure to death is more
concretely grounded. The increasing exposure to death in modern culture
is understood as the result of the act of sovereign power that creates
bare life, a life exposed to death. In modern culture this production of
bare life has spread because bare life has become the ground of our
political identity. Agamben does not regard death as some point of
resistance that somehow lies outside our culture. [[In **treating death
as a point of resistance** Baudrillard is in danger of turning death
into some sort of **authentic experience where we can
find**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or recover, [[our true values]{.mark}. In
fact, [the **exposure to death** in modern culture **seems to
be**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we shall see later in this book, **[[a far
more banal]{.mark} [and everyday process]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[Baudrillard's model]{.mark} does explore our exposure to
death]{.underline} in modern culture [but it [seems to offer no
adequate]{.mark} [explanation for that exposure.]{.mark} [Instead it
offers something like a **magical**]{.mark} or [metaphysical thinking
where what is excluded can only]{.mark} [ever return in a **more extreme
form**]{.mark}. A]{.underline}gamben provides an analysis which is more
precise but which is also not beyond criticism. If Baudrillard's thesis
has proven controversial and been treated with scepticism then so have
Agamben's claims. In particular, his history of bare life has faced five
major criticisms. The first is that Agamben's theory concerning bare
life is not well supported by the historical evidence and that he is
selective in the evidence he draws on. Secondly, that Agamben's history
of bare life is too straightforward, too linear, and so doesn't really
deal with the complex nature of the social history of death. Thirdly,
that in only studying Western culture Agamben is ethnocentric, and that
he excludes evidence from other cultures and tends to treat Western
culture as a monolithic whole. Fourthly, that Agamben's model of
biopolitics tends to erase the important distinctions between different
political systems, especially between democracies and totalitarian
states. And, finally, that he does not consider in enough depth the
different experiences of exposure to death, or the fact that this
exposure to death is unevenly distributed.

#### That celebration of death culminates in juvenile shock tactics that are fascinated with the aesthetics of mass death, resulting in apolitical apathy to suffering -- the negative's exposure to the banal and profound suffering through the mass suffering caused by capitalism encourages new modes of communal thinking capable of challenging modern death culture 

**Noys 5** \[Benjamin, BSc, MA, DPhil, Professor of Critical Theory at
the University of Chichester, *The Culture of Death*, Berg: New York, NY
(2005), p. 144-6\]

Chapter Five examined [[the **celebration of death** as]{.mark} a
**[transgressive]{.mark} experience**]{.underline} in contemporary art.
This celebration [[can be understood as]{.mark} [the result of our
**exposure to death as bare life**]{.mark} in modern
culture]{.underline}. What is problematic is [that [it remains bewitched
by bare life]{.mark} and **[fascinated with]{.mark} the threat of [mass
death]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Although it might make that threat
visible]{.underline}, quite literally, **[it leaves the politics of
modern death invisible]{.underline}**. [[The desire to **shock** and
**scandalise**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the desire to find in the
confrontation with death an experience of intensity, [[is]{.mark}
actually [quite limited.]{.mark} What [we need to]{.mark} do is to [move
**beyond an aesthetics of transgressive death**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bataille), or an aesthetics of intense life (Bacon/ Deleuze), [**to an
aesthetics of bare life**.]{.underline} I suggested that [the profane
and banal death in the car crash might be a better model of death in
modern culture]{.underline} than the extreme experiences on which
artists have so often concentrated. This is not to deny or ignore the
need for an aesthetics of modern death, as Agamben seems to do. Instead,
it is to suggest that [the aesthetics of [bare life is an]{.mark}
aesthetics of exposure: the **[exposure to a]{.mark} [banal and profane
death]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In this final chapter, I [have turned to
the politics of resistance to modern death. If the boundary between life
and death is political, then it may well be that **[we need a politics
of modern death]{.mark}** to resist the new forms of our exposure to
death.]{.underline} However, the value of resistance is problematic,
especially when that resistance to power is located in the body or in
life. The problem is that this resistance does not deal with bare life,
but celebrates bare life as the site of resistance. As we rethought
power in the light of death in Chapter Two, so now we have had to
rethink resistance in the light of death in this chapter[. It may well
be that [the value of resistance is exhausted in the face of our
exposure to death]{.mark} and that we need a new politics of exodus from
power. This politics is extremely ambiguous and has hardly even been
developed yet. [To develop]{.mark} [it further,]{.mark} and so to gauge
its worth, [is not just a matter of critical analysis but also of
practical and communal politics. The theorist]{.mark}]{.underline}
cannot stand in for the practice of politics, but [[must encourage **new
and inventive modes of communal thinking** that might allow us to
**think beyond the modern culture of death**]{.mark}. I am not sure that
it is possible to end on the reversal of the desperate state of the
current situation into a new hope]{.underline}, as Agamben suggests. We
might well actually require more careful and extended analysis of the
culture of death, which contests some of the limits of our contemporary
thinking. One way to do this, which I have used here, is to [approach
modern death through the concept of our exposure to death]{.underline}.
This approach has no pretence to solving the problem of modern death or
offering the definitive account of the contemporary culture of death.
Instead, it is a critical starting point that I have developed to try
and come to terms with the widespread sense of our exposure to death
after Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and in the current time of the 'war
against terrorism'. [The model of [exposure to death allows us to recast
the culture of death]{.mark}, [to approach our history]{.mark} [and the
present in new ways]{.mark}. [Perhaps it might also allow us to
challenge both the visibility and invisibility of death in
modern]{.mark} [culture]{.mark}, and to analyse the culture of death as
the culture of our survival in the face of the exposure to
death]{.underline}.

#### Their K is too reductive- their attempt to investigate death is counterproductive and constitutes theoretical violence

**Dollimore, PhD, 2013**

(Jonathan, [Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture]{.underline} )

Jean [Baudrillard presents]{.underline} the argument for the existence
of a [denial of death in]{.underline} its most [extreme form. For
him]{.underline}, this [denial]{.underline} is not only deeply
symptomatic of contemporary reality, but [represents]{.underline} an
[insidious]{.underline} and pervasive form of [ideological
control]{.underline}. His account depends heavily upon a familiar
critique of the Enlightenment\'s intellectual, cultural and political
legacy. This critique has become influential in recent cultural theory,
though [[Baudrillard\'s]{.mark} [version]{.mark}]{.underline} of it
[is]{.underline} [characteristically uncompromising and
[sweeping]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[more
[reductive]{.mark} than most]{.underline}**. The main claim is that
Enlightenment rationality is an instrument not of freedom and democratic
empowerment but, on the contrary, of repression and violence. Likewise
with [the Enlightenment\'s secular emphasis upon a common
humanity]{.underline}; for Baudrillard this [resulted in]{.underline}
what he calls [\'the cancer of the Human\']{.underline} - far from being
an inclusive category of emancipation, the idea of a universal humanity
made possible the demonizing of difference and the repressive
privileging of the normal: the \'Human\' is from the outset the
institution of its structural double, the \'Inhuman\*. This is all it
is: the progress of Humanity and Culture are simply the chain of
discriminations with which to brand \'Others\' with inhumanity, and
therefore with nullity, {p. 125) Baudrillard acknowledges here the
influence of Michel Foucault, but goes on to identify something more
fundamental and determining than anything identified by Foucault: at the
very core of the \'rationality\' of our culture, however, is an
exclusion that precedes every other, more radical than the exclusion of
madmen, children or inferior races, an exclusion preceding all these and
serving as their model: the exclusion of the dead and of death, (p.
12.6) So total is this exclusion that, \'today, it is not normal to be
dead, and this is new. [To be dead is an unthinkable
anomaly]{.underline}; nothing else is as offensive as this. Death is a
delinquency, and an incurable deviancy\' (p. 126). [He insists that the
attempt to abolish death]{.underline} (especially through capitalist
accumulation), to separate it from life, [leads only to a culture
permeated by death]{.underline} - \'quite simply, ours is a culture of
death\' (p. 127). Moreover, it is the repression of death which
facilitates \'the repressive socialization of life\'; all existing
agencies of repression and control take root in the disastrous
separation of death from life (p. 130). And, as if that were not enough,
our very concept of reality has its origin in the same separation or
disjunction (pp. 130-33). Modern culture is contrasted with that of the
primitive and the savage, in which, allegedly, life and death were not
separated; also with that of the Middle Ages, where, allegedly, there
was still a collectivist, \'folkloric and joyous\' conception of death.
This and [many]{.underline} other [aspects of the argument are
questionable]{.underline}, [but perhaps [the main
objection]{.mark}]{.underline} to Baudrillard\'s case [[is his view of
culture as a macro-conspiracy]{.mark} conducted by an insidious
ideological prime-mover whose agency is always invisibly at
work]{.underline} (rather like God). Thus (from just one page), [the
political economy supposedly \^intends\* to eliminate death through
accumulation; and \'our whole culture is just one huge effort to
dissociate life and death\']{.underline} {p. 147; my emphases). [What
those like Baudrillard find interesting]{.underline} about death
[is]{.underline} not the old conception of it as a pre-cultural constant
which diminishes the significance of all cultural achievement, but, on
the contrary, [its function as a culturally relative]{.underline} -
which is to say culturally formative [- construct]{.underline}. And, if
cultural relativism is on the one hand about relinquishing the comfort
of the absolute, for those like Baudrillard it is also about the new
strategies of intellectual mastery made possible by the very
disappearance of the absolute. [Such modern accounts of how death is
allegedly denied]{.underline}, of how death is the supreme ideological
fix, [entail a new intensity and complexity of interpretation and
decipherment, a kind of hermeneutics of death.]{.underline} [[To
reinterpret death as a **deep effect of**]{.mark}
**[ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,** even to the extent of regarding
it as the most fundamental ideological adhesive of modern political
repression and social control, [[is]{.mark} simultaneously [to denounce
it as]{.mark} in some sense a deception or [an illusion]{.mark}, and to
bring it within the domain of knowledge]{.underline} and analysis as
never before. [[Death]{.mark}, for so long regarded as the ultimate
reality]{.underline} - [that which disempowers the human and obliterates
all human achievement]{.underline}, including the achievements of
knowledge - **[now [becomes the object of a hugely empowering
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Like omniscient
seers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [intellectuals like
Baudrillard]{.underline} and Bauman [relentlessly anatomize and diagnose
the modern]{.underline} (or post-modern) [human condition in relation to
an ideology of death which becomes the key with which to unlock the
secret workings of Western culture]{.underline} in all its
insidiousness. [Baudrillard]{.underline} in particular [applies his
theory relentlessly, steamrollering across the cultural significance of
the quotidian and the contingent]{.underline}. **[[His is an
imperialist]{.mark}, omniscient analytic, a perpetual act of reductive
[generalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [a self-empowering intellectual
performance [which proceeds without]{.mark} [qualification]{.mark} and
without any sense that something might be mysterious or
inexplicable]{.underline}. As such **[[it constitutes]{.mark} a kind of
[interpretative]{.mark}, theoretical [violence]{.mark},]{.underline}**
[an extreme but still representative instance of how the relentless
anatomizing and diagnosis of death in the modern world has become a
struggle for empowerment through]{.underline} masterful -i.e.
**[reductive - critique]{.underline}**. Occasionally [one wonders if the
[advocates]{.mark} of the denial-of-death argument are not **themselves
in denial**.]{.underline} [They [speak about death endlessly]{.mark} yet
indirectly, analysing not death so much as our culture\'s
attitude]{.underline} towards it. To that extent [it is not the truth of
death but the truth of our culture that they seek.]{.underline} But,
[even as they make death signify in this indirect way, **[it is still
death that is compelling them to speak]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And
[those like Baudrillard]{.underline} and Bauman [speak urgently,
**[performing intellectually a desperate mimicry of the]{.mark}
[omniscience which death denies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One senses that
[the entire modern enterprise of [relativizing
death]{.mark}]{.underline}, of understanding it culturally and socially,
**[[may be an attempt to disavow it]{.mark} in the very act of analysing
and demystifying it.]{.underline}** [Ironically]{.underline} then, [for
all its rejection]{.underline} of the Enlightenment\'s arrogant belief
in the power of rationality, [this analysis of death remains indebted to
a fundamental Enlightenment aspiration to mastery through knowledge.
**[Nothing could be more \'Enlightenment\']{.mark}, in the pejorative
sense that Baudrillard describes, [than his]{.mark} own almost
megalomaniac [wish to penetrate the truth of death]{.mark}, [and the
masterful controlling intellectual]{.mark} [subject which that attempt
presupposes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And this may be true to an extent
for all of us more or less involved in the anthropological or
quasi-anthropological accounts of death which assume that, by looking at
how a culture handles death, we disclose things about a culture which it
does not know about itself. So what has been said of sex in the
nineteenth century may also be true of death in the twentieth: it has
not been repressed so much as resignified in new, complex and productive
ways which then legitimate a never-ending analysis of it. [[It is
questionable whether]{.mark} the denial of [death has ever
really]{.mark} [figured in our culture]{.mark} in the way]{.underline}
that [Baudrillard]{.underline} and Bauman [suggest]{.underline}. Of
course, the ways of dealing with and speaking about death have changed
hugely, and have in some respects involved something like denial. But
[[in philosophical]{.mark} and literary [terms there has never been a
denial of death]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 Moreover, however understood, the
pre-modern period can hardly be said to have been characterized by the
\'healthy\* attitude that advocates of the denial argument often claim,
imply or assume. In fact it could be said that we can begin to
understand the vital role of death in Western culture only when we
accept death as profoundly, compellingly and irreducibly
traumatic.(123-6)

[For those]{.underline} among us [who seek in philosophy a way to
grapple with our lives rather than]{.underline} to [solve logical
puzzles]{.underline}; for those whose reading and whose writing are not
merely appropriate steps toward academic advancement but a struggle to
see ourselves and our world in a fresher, clearer light; for those who
find nourishment among impassioned ideas and go hungry among empty
truths: [[there is a struggle]{.underline}]{.mark} that is often [waged
[within us]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is a struggle that will be familiar
to anyone who has heard in Foucault's sentences the stammering of a
fellow human being struggling to speak in words worth hearing. Why else
would we read Foucault? [[We]{.mark} seek to]{.underline} [[conceive
what is wrong in the world]{.mark},]{.underline} [to grasp [it in a way
that offers]{.mark} us [the possibility for change]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[We know that there is much that is]{.underline}, to use Foucault's
word, '[intolerable']{.underline}. [There is [much]{.mark}
that]{.underline} [[binds us to social and political arrangements that
are oppressive]{.underline}]{.mark}, domineering, patronizing, and
exploitative. [[We would like to understand why this is and how it
happens, in order that we may prevent its
continuance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In short, [we want our theories to be
tools for changing the world]{.underline}, for offering it a new face,
or at least a new expression. There is struggle in this, struggle
against ideas and ways of thinking that present themselves to us as
inescapable. We know this struggle from Foucault's writings. It is not
clear that he ever wrote about anything else. But this is not the
struggle I want to address here. For [[there is]{.mark},]{.underline}
[on the other hand, another search and [another
goal]{.mark}.]{.underline} They lie [[not so much in]{.mark} the
[revisioning]{.mark} of [this world as in the embrace of
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is much to be celebrated in the lives we
lead]{.underline}, or in those led by others, or in the unfolding of the
world as it is, a world resonant with the rhythms of our voices and our
movements. [We would like to understand this, too]{.underline}, to grasp
in thought the elusive beauty of our world. There is, after all, no
other world, except, as Nietzsche taught, for those who would have
created another one with which to denigrate our own. In short, [we would
like our thought to celebrate our lives]{.underline}. [[To change the
world and to celebrate life]{.underline}]{.mark}. This, as the
theologian Harvey Cox saw, is the struggle within us.1 [It is a struggle
in which]{.underline} [[one cannot choose sides; or]{.underline}]{.mark}
better, [a struggle in which [one must choose both
sides]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[abandonment of one for]{.mark} the
sake of [the other]{.mark} can [lead only to disaster or
callousness]{.mark}. Forsaking the celebration of life for the sake of
changing the world is the path of the sad revolutionary]{.underline}. In
his preface to Anti-Oedipus, Foucault writes that one does not have to
be sad in order to be revolutionary. The matter is more urgent than
that, however. One cannot be both sad and revolutionary. Lacking a sense
of the wondrous that is already here, among us, one who is bent upon
changing the world can only become solemn or bitter. He or she is
focused only on the future; the present is what is to be overcome. The
vision of what is not but must come to be overwhelms all else, and the
point of change itself becomes lost. The history of the left in the 20th
century offers numerous examples of this, and the disaster that attends
to it should be evident to all of us by now. [[The alternative
is]{.mark} surely [not]{.mark} to shift one's allegiance to the [pure
celebration of life]{.mark},]{.underline} although there are many who
have chosen this path. [[It is at best blindness not to see]{.mark} the
[misery]{.mark} that envelops so many of our fellow humans]{.underline},
to say nothing of what happens to sentient nonhuman creatures. [[The
attempt to jettison world-changing for an]{.mark} uncritical [assent to
the world as it is requires a self-deception]{.mark} that I assume would
be anathema]{.underline} for those of us who have studied Foucault.
Indeed, it is anathema for all of us who awaken each day to an America
whose expansive boldness is matched only by an equally expansive
disregard for those we place in harm's way. This is the struggle, then.
The one between the desire for life-celebration and the desire for
world-changing. [[The struggle between reveling in the
contingent]{.mark} and fragile [joys that constitute our world and
wresting it from its intolerability]{.mark}]{.underline}. I am sure it
is a struggle that is not foreign to anyone who is reading this. I am
sure as well that [the stakes for choosing one side over another that I
have recalled here are obvious to everyone. [The question]{.mark} then
[becomes]{.mark} one of [how to choose both sides at
once]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### at: liberal war 

#### "Liberal warfare" impact is so abstract that it's analytically useless and doesn't provide any accurate method to understand war

David **Chandler 9**, Professor of IR at University of Westminster,
\"Liberal War and Foucaultian Metaphysics\", Review of Dillon and Reid's
*The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live*,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars]{.mark} and conflicts [but]{.mark} to [an
abstract model]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire
to'remove war from the life of humanity'which'derives from the way in
which liberalism takes the life of the species as its referent object of
politics ─ biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of
war very much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that [the distinctiveness of ']{.mark}the
[liberal]{.mark} way of [war]{.mark}' which they seek to explore [cannot
be more than a fool's quest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They assert that
they will critically uncover the paradox of liberal war: why it is that
Realist or geostrategic war accepts the necessity of war but attempts to
limit it, while liberals wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to
fight unlimited wars. Yet, they admit that **[[this starting point
is]{.mark} already [an ideological dead end]{.mark}]{.underline}** [─
the [wars of the twentieth century give the lie to the]{.mark} idea that
there is some [distinction between 'unending crusades' and 'limited
jousts]{.mark} between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
[alleged]{.mark} to be fought differently to geo-political wars for
territory, because the '[drivers' of war are]{.mark} not territorialized
interests but the biopolitical [framings of the]{.mark} needs of the
[human]{.mark}, how human life can and should be lived.]{.underline}
[Inevitably [there are **insuperable methodological hurdles** to
this]{.mark} Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already, [there occurs the
first fundamental aporia: [how do we tell the difference between a
liberal and non-liberal war?]{.mark}]{.underline} [There appears to be
no way of preventing the category of liberal war from becoming a
lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought biopolitically
only if we are told that these are the motives by those fighting
them]{.underline}.¶ **[[This separation of liberal ways of war from
territorialised framings]{.mark} of geostrategic contestation [makes
little sense]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a framework for
understanding]{.underline} either liberal rule or liberal ways of
[war]{.underline}. In fact, [in defining liberal war in this way the
connection between liberal rule and war is entirely
severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions also be
geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [[It would appear]{.mark} that
[every form of rule]{.mark} and of war [has]{.mark} at least [an
implicit view of the 'human']{.mark} and through this view of the human
the form of rule and the way of war are rationalized. [There is
not]{.mark} and cannot be [anything]{.mark} specifically ['liberal'
about this]{.mark}]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing,
through war on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's
stoic cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[[The]{.mark} key starting [assumption]{.mark},
that [the liberal way of war can be isolated]{.mark} from any other -
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** its alleged specific form, of '**[[unending
violence', explained by its referent]{.mark} of the human -
[appears]{.mark} to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
[unproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction
at which Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that
would help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

#### 'Wars for humanity' are an ahistorical myth -- their "Empire" impact can't explain why Western intervention happened in Libya and Iraq but not in Yemen 

Benno Gerhard **Teschke 11**, IR prof at the University of Sussex,
"Fatal attraction: a critique of Carl Schmitt\'s international political
and legal theory", International Theory (2011), 3 : pp 179-227

For at the centre of the heterodox -- partly post-structuralist, partly
realist -- neo-Schmittian analysis stands the conclusion of The Nomos:
the thesis of a structural and continuous relation between liberalism
and violence (Mouffe 2005, 2007; Odysseos 2007). It suggests that, in
sharp contrast to the liberal-cosmopolitan programme of 'perpetual
peace', the geographical expansion of liberal modernity was accompanied
by the intensification and de-formalization of war in the international
construction of liberal-constitutional states of law and the production
of liberal subjectivities as rights-bearing individuals. [Liberal
world-ordering proceeds via the conduit of wars for
humanity]{.underline}, leading to Schmitt\'s 'spaceless universalism'.
In this perspective, [**[a straight line is drawn from WWI to the War on
Terror]{.mark} to verify Schmitt\'s long-term prognostic** of the 20th
century as the age of 'neutralizations and
de-politicizations']{.underline} (Schmitt 1993). **[But [this attempt to
read]{.mark} the [history]{.mark} of 20th century international
relations in terms of a succession of confrontations between the
carrier-nations of liberal modernity and the criminalized foes at its
outer margins [seems unable to comprehend]{.mark} the
[complexities]{.mark} and specificities [of 'liberal'
world-ordering]{.mark}, then and now]{.underline}**. [For in the cases
of Wilhelmine, Weimar and fascist Germany]{.underline}, the assumption
that their conflicts with the Anglo-American liberal-capitalist
heartland were grounded in an [antagonism]{.underline} [between liberal
modernity]{.underline} [and a recalcitrant Germany outside its
geographical and conceptual lines]{.underline} [runs counter to the
historical evidence]{.underline}. For this reading presupposes that
late-Wilhelmine Germany was not already substantially penetrated by
capitalism and fully incorporated into the capitalist world economy,
posing the question of whether the causes of WWI lay in the capitalist
dynamics of inter-imperial rivalry (Blackbourn and Eley 1984), or in
processes of belated and incomplete liberal-capitalist development, due
to the survival of 're-feudalized' elites in the German state classes
and the marriage between 'rye and iron' (Wehler 1997). It also assumes
that the late-Weimar and early Nazi turn towards the construction of an
autarchic German regionalism -- Mitteleuropa or Großraum -- was not
deeply influenced by the international ramifications of the 1929 Great
Depression, but premised on a purely political--existentialist assertion
of German national identity. Against a reading of the early 20th century
conflicts between 'the liberal West' and Germany as 'wars for humanity'
between an expanding liberal modernity and its political exterior, there
is more evidence to suggest that these [confrontations were interstate
conflicts within the crisis-ridden and nationally uneven capitalist
project of modernity]{.underline}. Similar objections and caveats to the
binary opposition between the Western discourse of liberal humanity
against non-liberal foes apply to the more recent period. [For how can
this optic explain that **[the 'liberal West'
coexisted]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and keeps coexisting) [**[with]{.mark}
a large number of** pliant **[authoritarian
client-regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mubarak\'s [Egypt]{.underline},
Suharto\'s Indonesia, Pahlavi\'s Iran, Fahd\'s [Saudi-Arabia,
even]{.underline} Gaddafi\'s pre-intervention [Libya]{.underline}, to
name but a few), [**[which]{.mark}** were and **[are]{.mark} actively
[managed]{.mark}** and supported by the West **[as
anti-liberal]{.mark}** Schmittian **[states of emergency]{.mark}**, with
concerns for liberal subjectivities and Human Rights secondary to the
strategic interests of political and geopolitical stability and economic
access]{.underline}? Even in the more obvious cases of Afghanistan,
Iraq, and, now, Libya, [the idea that Western intervention has to be
conceived as an encounter between the liberal project and a series of
foes outside its sphere seems to rely on a denial of their antecedent
histories as geopolitically and socially contested state-building
projects]{.underline} in pro-Western fashion, deeply co-determined by
long histories of Western anti-liberal colonial and post-colonial
legacies. If these states (or social forces within them) turn against
their imperial masters, the conventional policy expression is
'blowback'. [And as]{.underline} [**[the]{.mark} Schmittian analytical
[vocabulary]{.mark}** does not include a conception of human agency and
social forces -- only friend/enemy groupings and collective political
entities governed by executive decision -- **it**]{.underline} [also
**[lacks]{.mark} the [categories of analysis to comprehend]{.mark}** the
social dynamics that drive the **[struggles around sovereign power
and]{.mark} the eventual [overcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for
example, **[[of Tunisian and Egyptian states of emergency without US-led
wars for humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, [[it seems unlikely
that]{.mark} the generic idea of liberal world-ordering and the
production of [liberal subjectivities can]{.mark} actually [explain why
Western intervention seems improbable in some cases]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Bahrain, Qatar, [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} or Syria) [and [more
likely in others]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. Serbia, **[Afghanistan,
[Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}). Liberal
world-ordering consists of differential strategies of building,
coordinating, and drawing liberal and anti-liberal states into the
Western orbit, and overtly or covertly intervening and refashioning them
once they step out of line. [These are conflicts within a world, which
seem to push the term liberalism beyond its original meaning. The
generic Schmittian idea of a liberal 'spaceless universalism' sits
uncomfortably with the realities of maintaining an America-supervised
'informal empire', **which has to manage a persisting interstate system
in diverse and case-specific ways**]{.underline}. But it is this
persistence of a worldwide system of states, which encase national
particularities, which renders challenges to American supremacy possible
in the first place.

Santa Cruz where some attributed "reactionary" and "left cultural
conservatism" to belief in "reactionary" "foundationalist humanism"42
Post-structuralism cannot escape its own essentialist conception of
identity. For example, Butler contends in Feminist Contentions that
democratic feminists must embrace the post-structuralist
"non-definability of woman" as best suited to open democratic
constitution of what it is to be a "woman."43 But this is itself a
"closed" position and runs counter to the practices of many democratic
feminist activists who have tried to develop a pluralist, yet collective
identity around the shared experiences of being a woman in a patriarchal
society (of course, realizing that working-class women and women of
color experience patriarchy in some ways that are distinct from the
patriarchy experienced by middle-class white women).¶ One query that
post-structuralist theorists might ask themselves: [[has]{.mark} there
[ever]{.mark} existed [a]{.mark} mass social [movement]{.mark} that
[defined its primary]{.mark} "ethical" [values as]{.mark} being those of
"**[instability and flux]{.mark}**"?]{.underline} Certainly many sexual
politics activists are cognizant of the fluid nature of sexuality and
sexual and gender identity. But [[only a small]{.underline}]{.mark}
(disproportionately university educated) [[segment of the
women's]{.mark} and [gay and lesbian movement]{.mark} would [subscribe
to]{.mark}]{.underline} (or even be aware of) [the core principles of
[post-structuralist]{.mark} "anti-essentialist [epistemology." **Nor
would they be agnostic as to whether the state should protect**]{.mark}
**their [rights]{.mark} to express their sexuality.**]{.underline}
Post-structuralist theorists cannot avoid justificatory arguments for
why some identities should be considered open and democratic and others
exclusionary and anti-democratic. That is, how could post-structuralist
political theorists argue that Nazi or Klan "ethics" are antithetical to
a democratic society---and that a democratic society can rightfully ban
certain forms of "agonal" (e.g. harassing forms of behavior against
minorities) struggle on the part of such anti-democratic groups.¶ [A

A [politics of radical democratic pluralism cannot be securely grounded
by a]{.underline} whole-hearted [epistemological critique of
"enlightenment rationality." For implicit to any radical democratic
project is a belief in the equal moral worth of persons; to embrace such
a position renders one at least a "critical defender" of enlightenment

from an epistemology or ontology a politics; such attempts simply
replace enlightenment meta-narratives with postmodern (allegedly anti)
meta-narratives. Such efforts represent an idealist version of the

read social consciousness off of the structural position of "the agent."
[A democratic political theory must offer both a]{.underline} theory of

reject explicit moral deliberation as a bad faith Nietzschean attempt at
"ressentiment." Instead, they celebrate the amoral, yet ethical
strivings of a Machiavellian or Gramscian realist "war of position."44
Sheldon Wolin, however, has written convincingly of how Machiavelli can
be read as an ethical realist, a theorist of moral utilitarianism.45
Even a Machiavellian or Gramscian political "realist" must depend upon
moral argument to justify the social utility of hard political choices.
That is, if one reads both as ethical utilitarians who believe that, at
times, one must "dirty" one's hands in order to act ethically in
politics, then they embrace a utilitarian, "just war" theory of ethical
choice. According to this consequentialist moral logic, "bad means" are
only justifiable if they are the only, unavoidable way to achieve a
greater ethical good---and if the use of such "bad means" are absolutely
minimized. Such "[**[hard" political choices yield social policies and
political outcomes that fix identities as well as transform
them]{.underline}**.]{.mark}¶ Not only in regard to epistemological
questions has post-structuralist theory created a new political
"metaphysics" which misconstrues the nature of democratic political
practice; [the post-structuralist analysis of]{.underline} "the death of
man" and "[[the death of the subject]{.mark}"]{.underline} also
**[[radically preclude]{.mark} meaningful [political
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As with Michel Foucault, Butler conceives
of "subjects" as "produced" by powerknowledge discourses. In Butler's
view, the modernist concept of an autonomous subject is a "fictive
construct"; and [[the very act of adhering to a belief in]{.mark}
autonomous human [choice is to engage in "exclusion and]{.mark}
differentiations, perhaps a [repression]{.mark},]{.underline} that is
subsequently concealed, covered over, by the effect of autonomy."46 That
is, the power of discourse, of language and the unconscious, "produces
subjects." [If those "subjects" conceive of themselves as having the
capacity for conscious choice, they are guilty of "repressing" the
manner in which their own "subjectivity" is itself produced by
discursive]{.underline} 61 exclusion: "if we agree that politics and a
power exist already at the level at which the subject and its agency are
articulated and made possible, then agency can be presumed only at the
cost of refusing to inquire into its construction."47 Susan Bickford
pithily summarizes the post-structuralist rejection of the modernist
subject: "power is not wielded by autonomous subjects; rather through
power, subjectivity is crafted."48 Bickford grants that
post-structuralism provides some insight into how group and individual
identity is "culturally constructed." But Bickford goes on to contend
that [[after post-structuralism exposes the "lie of]{.mark} the natural"
(that there are no natural [human identities]{.mark}), "socially
constructed" modern **[individuals still wish to act in consort with
others and to use]{.mark} human [communication]{.mark} to influence
others: "[people generally understand themselves as]{.mark} culturally
constituted and [capable of agency]{.mark}**."]{.underline}49¶ [For if
there is no "doer behind the deed]{.underline}," but only "performative"
acts that constitute the subject, [how can the theorist]{.underline} (or
activist) [assign agency or moral responsibility to actors who are
"constituted by discursive practices]{.underline}." ("Discursive
practices" engaged in by whom, the observer may ask?) Butler insists
that not only is the subject "socially constituted" by power/knowledge
discourses, but so too is the "ontologically reflexive self" of the
enlightenment. Now if this claim is simply that all social critics are
socially-situated, then this view of agency is no more radical a claim
than that made by Michael Walzer in his conception of the social critic
(or agent). Walzer argues that even the most radical dissident must rely
upon the critical resources embedded within his own culture (often in
the almost-hidden interstices of that culture). Effective critical
agency cannot depend on some abstract universal, external logic.50
[Asserting that critical capacities are themselves socially constructed
provides the reader with no means by which to judge whether forms of
"resistance" are democratic and which are not.]{.underline} That is,
[[no matter how hard one tries to substitute an]{.mark}
aesthetic]{.underline}, "ironic," "amoral [[ethical
sensibility]{.underline}]{.mark}" for morality,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} social critic and [political [activist cannot
escape engaging in]{.mark} moral argument and [justification with fellow
citizens]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Butler astutely notes that "resistance"
often mirrors the very powerknowledge discourses it rejects---resisting
hegemonic norms without offering alternative conceptions of a common
political life. But Butler seems to affirm the possibility (by whom?) of
effective rejection of such "norming" by "performative resignification."
But [the "resignification" of "performative" discursive constructions
provides no criteria by which to judge whether a given "resignification"
is emancipatory or repressive]{.underline}.51 And just who (if not a
relatively coherent, choosing human subject) is "performing" the
resignification. Furthermore, [[if all]{.mark} forms of
[identity]{.mark} and social meaning [are predicated upon "exclusion,"
then the]{.mark} democratic [theorist needs to distinguish among those
identities which "exclude" in a democratic way and those which exclude
in an anti-humanist, racist, and sexist manner.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Some social "identities" are democratic and pluralist, such as those
created by voluntary affiliations. But other "identities," such as
structural, involuntary class differences and racial and sexual
hierarchies, must be transformed, even eliminated, if democracy is to be
furthered]{.underline}. And how we behave---or "perform"---can subvert
(or reinforce) such undemocratic social structures. But if these social
structures are immutably inscribed by62 "performative practices," then
there can be no democratic resistance. In her call for an ironic
politics of "performative resistance," Butler seems to imply that human
beings have the capacity to choose which "performative practices" to
engage in---and from which to abstain. If this is the case, then a
modernist conception of agency and moral responsibility has covertly
snuck its way back into Butler's political strategy.52

Sloop and Ono", Philosophy & Rhetoric, Volume 32, Number 1, p. 96-101

[My [concern]{.mark}]{.underline} with this movement [[centers
around]{.mark} an issue that]{.underline} Sloop and Ono [seem to take as
a given, namely, [the **role of the critic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
one hand, calling for the systematic investigation of existing
marginalized discourses is a natural extension both of critical rhetoric
(see McKerrow 1989, 1991) and of the general ideological turn in
criticism (see Wander 1983). On the other hand, [the ease of transition
from criticism in the service of resistance to criticism of resistance
may obscure the need to address some fundamental issues regarding the
general function of rhetorical criticism in an uncertain and contentious
world]{.underline}. Beyond [licensing the critic to engage in political
struggle]{.underline}, Sloop and Ono advocate the pursuit of covert
resistant discourses. Such a move not [only stretches our understanding
of rhetoric and criticism, but also alters significantly the
relationship between critic and out- law. Critical interrogation of
dominant discursive practices in the service of political/cultural
reform is supplanted in favor of [positioning]{.mark} covert out- law
[communities as **objects of investigation**]{.mark}. Invited to seek
out subversive discourses, [**the critic** is]{.mark} positioned as [the
**active agent of change** and]{.mark} the out-law [discourse
becomes]{.mark} **merely [instrumental]{.mark}**. Rather than academic
criticism acting in service of everyday acts of resistance, everyday
acts of resistance are put into the service of academic
criticism.]{.underline} Rhetorical resistance That we are \"caught
within conflicting logics of justice that are culturally struggled
over\" (Sloop and Ono 1997, 50) and that rhetoric is employed in these
struggles seems an uncontroversial statement. Despite the theoretical
miasma surrounding judgment, Sloop and Ono accurately note, the material
process of rendering judgments (and of disputing the logics of
litigation) continues in the world of actually practiced discourse. In
the materially contested world, rhetoric is utilized both by those
seeking to secure the grounds of dominant judgment and by those seeking
to undermine or supplant dominant cultural logics with some out-law
notion of justice. The distinction between these two cultural groups,
\"in-law\" and out- law, however, deserves some consideration prior to
any discussion of the role of the critic as implied in the out-law
discourse project. The discourse of the dominant or those within the
bounds of superordinate logics of litigation is reminiscent of Michel De
Certeau\'s (1984) strategic discourse. For De Certeau, strategies are
utilized by those who have authority by virtue of their proper position.
Strategies exploit the institutionally guaranteed background consensus
by which power relations (and litigations) are maintained and advanced.
In contrast, tactics are utilized by those having no proper place of
authority within the discursive economy who must seek opportunities
whereby the discourse of the dominant might be undermined and contested.
To extend Sloop and Ono\'s definition, out-law discourses are those that
can (and, by their analysis, do) take advantage of situations (e.g.,
race riots) to disrupt the regularity of dominant cultural groups. The
ongoing struggle between strategically instituted cultural dominants and
the \"out-law always lurk\[ing\] in the distance\" (66) is acknowledged,
even celebrated, by Sloop and Ono. What their acknowledgment fails to
provide, however, is a clear need for critical intervention. Indeed,
quite the reverse is presented: It is the critic (particularly the
left-leaning critic) who needs out-law discourse. While the struggles
over justice, equality, and freedom have gone on, the left-leaning
critics are those who have theoretically excluded themselves from the
disputes. The study of out-law dis- courses, then, provides a means to
reinvigorate the intellectual and re-institute (academic) leftist
thinking into popular political struggles (53-54). Thus, Sloop and
Ono\'s project incorporates three types of rhetoric: the rhetoric of the
in-law, presumably the traditional object of critical attention; the
rhetoric of the out-law, the study of which may transform our
understanding of judgment as well as reinvigorate leftist democratic
critiques; and the rhetoric of the critics who, having lost their
political po- tency, can exploit the discourse of the out-law to promote
ideological struggles. It is to this critical rhetoric that I now turn.
Resistance criticism Sloop and Ono (1997) clearly state the relationship
they envision between the rhetorical critic and out-law discourse:
\"Ultimately, we will argue that the role of critical rhetoricians is to
produce \'materialist conceptions of judgment,\' using out-law judgments
to disrupt dominant logics of judgment\" (54; emphasis added). Here the
critic seeks out vernacular discourse (60), focuses on the methods and
values embodied in these communities (62), listens to and evaluates the
out-law community (62-63), and chooses appropriate discourses for the
purpose of disrupting dominant practices (63). Essentially, it is the
critic who seeks out marginalized discourses and returns them to the
center for the purpose of provoking dominant cultural groups (63).
Despite acknowledging the efficacy of out-law discourses, Sloop and Ono
assume that the critiques generated and presented by the out-law
community have only minimal effect. The irony, and indeed arrogance, of
this assumption is evident when they claim: \"There are cases, however,
when, without the prompting of academic critics, out-law discourses
serve local purposes at times and at others resonate within dominant
discourses, disrupting sedimented ways of thinking, transforming
dominant forms of judgment\" (60; emphasis added). Sloop and Ono seem to
suggest that such locally generated critiques are the exception, whereas
the political efficacy of the academic critic is the rule. This seems an
odd claim, given that the justification for their out-law discourse
project is the lack of politically viable academic critique and the
perceived potency of out-law conceptions of judgment. [[Their suggestion
that out-law communities]{.mark} are in [need]{.mark} of [the academic
critic **contradicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[the]{.mark}
already [disruptive nature]{.mark} of existing out-law
discourses]{.underline} (the grounds for using out-law discourse), but
also the impotence of contemporary critical discourse (the warrant for
studying out-law discourse). By this I do not mean that the critiques
and theories generated by academically instituted intellectuals have not
been incorporated into subversive discourses. Just as out-law discourses
inevitably mount critiques of dominant logics, so, too, the perspectives
on rhetoric and criticism generated by academics are used in resistance
movements. Feminist critiques of patriarchy, queer theories of
homophobia, postcolonial interrogations of race have found their way
into the service of resistant groups. The key distinction I wish to make
is that the existence of criticism (academic or self-generated) in
resistance does not necessitate Sloop and Ono\'s move to a criticism of
resistance. What [Sloop and Ono [fail to offer]{.mark}]{.underline} is
[[an adequate argument for \"**taking**]{.mark} **public [speaking out
of the streets]{.mark}** [and **studying it in the classroom**]{.mark},
for [treating it less as]{.mark} an **expression of
[protest]{.mark}**[\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wander 1983, 3)
[[and]{.mark} more [as an **object for analysis**]{.mark} and
**reproduction** [within the]{.mark} **political economy of the
[academy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Philip Wander made a similar charge
against Herbert Wicheln\'s early critical project, and this concern
should remain at the forefront of any discussion aimed at expanding the
scope and function of criticism. [Sloop and Ono offer [numerous
directives for the critic]{.mark} [without addressing **whether the
critic should be examining**]{.mark} **out-law [discourses in the first
place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is too early to suggest any
definitive answer to the question of criticism of resistance, some
preliminary arguments as to why critics should not pursue out-law
discourses can be offered: (1) [Hidden out-law discourses may have
**good reasons to stay hidden**]{.underline}. Sloop and Ono specifically
instruct us that \"the logic of the out-law must constantly be searched
for, brought forth\" (66) and used to disrupt dominant practices. But
[[are we to believe]{.mark} that]{.underline} all out-law discourses are
prepared to mount such a challenge to the dominant cultural logic? Or,
indeed, that the [[members]{.mark} of out-law communities [are prepared
to be **brought into the arena of**]{.mark} **public
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the service of reconstituting
logics of litigation? It seems highly unlikely that all divergent
cultural groups have developed equally, or that all members of these
groups share Sloop and Ono\'s \"imperial impulse\" (51) to promote their
conceptions and practices of justice. (2) Academic critical discourse is
not transparent. Here I allude to the overall problem of translation
(see Foucault 1994; Lyotard 1988; Lyotard and Thebaud 1985; Zabus 1995)
as an extension of the previous concern. Critical discourse cannot
become the medium of commensurability for divergent language games. Are
we to believe that the \"use\" of out-law dis- course by critics to
disrupt dominant practices can fail to do violence to these
diverse/divergent logics? Are out-law discourses merely tools to be
exploited and discarded in the pursuit of returning leftist academic
dis- course to the center? (3) Perhaps the academic translation of
out-law discourse could be true to the internal logic of the out-law
community. And, [perhaps the re-presentation of out-law logic within the
academic community will bestow a degree of **legitimacy** on the out-law
community. [**Nonetheless**, the effect]{.mark} of legitimizing out-law
discourse [is]{.mark} unknown and potentially **[destructive]{.mark}**.
In an effort [to **siphon**]{.mark} **the political [energy]{.mark}** of
out-law discourse [into academic practice, we]{.mark} may ultimately
**[destroy]{.mark}** the dissatisfaction that serves as [a
**cathexis**]{.mark} for these out-law discourses]{.underline}. It seems
possible that [academic [recognition]{.mark} might [**take the place**
of]{.mark} struggle for [material opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Fraser 1997). [[But, will]{.mark} academic [legitimation create
**any**]{.mark} **material [changes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[conditions]{.mark} of out-law communities?]{.underline} I mean to
suggest, not that it is better to allow the out-law community to suffer
for its cause, but rather that incorporating the struggle into an
(admittedly) impotent academic critique does not offer a prima facie
alternative. (4) Criticism of resistance denies the practical and
theoretical importance of opportunity. Returning to De Certeau\'s notion
of tactics, the crucial element of these discursive moves is their use
of opportunity to disrupt the proper authority of the dominant. The
kairos of intervention provides the key to undermining \"in-law\"
discourses. But when is the \"right moment in time\" for the academic
reproduction of out-law discourse? Mapping the points of resistance (ala
Foucault and Biesecker) entails interrogating \"in-law\" discourses for
their incongruities and contradictions, not turning the academic gaze
upon those communities waiting for an opportunity. Out-laws do not lurk
in the forefront (66), hoping to be exposed by academic critics; they
wait for the right moment for their disruption. Rhetoricians can provide
rhetorical instructions for seeking opportunities and for exploiting
these opportunities (literally making the culturally weaker argument the
stronger), but this does not justify interrogating (intervening in) the
cultural logics of the marginalized. The concerns raised here are not
designed to dismiss Sloop and Ono\'s provocative essay. The divergent
critical logic they outline deserves careful consideration within the
critical community, and it is my hope that the concerns I raise may help
to further problematize the relationship between resistance and
rhetorical criticism. Rhetorical criticism As I have suggested, my
purpose is to use the provocative nature of Sloop and Ono\'s project to
extend disputes regarding the ends of rhetorical criticism. Diverging
perspectives on the ends of criticism have been categorized by Barbara
Warnick (1992) as falling along four general lines: artist, analyst,
audience, and advocate. Leah Ceccarelli (1997) discerns similar
categories around the aesthetic, epistemic, and political ends of
rhetorical criticism. The out-law discourse project presents clear ties
to the notion of critic as advocate. [For Sloop and Ono, the critic is
an **interested party**, discerning]{.underline} (and at times
disputing) [the underlying values and forces contained within a
discourse. Additionally, however, [the]{.mark} out-law discourse [critic
is]{.mark} an analyst [focusing on]{.mark} the
**[hidden]{.mark}**]{.underline}, aberrant [[texts]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the out-law [[and **\"rendering\]**]{.mark} **an incoherent or
esoteric text [comprehensible\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Warnick 1992,
233). Now, I am not suggesting that a critic must serve only one
function or that the roles of advocate and analyst are mutually
exclusive; rather, [these entanglings of power]{.underline} (political
ends) [and knowledge]{.underline} (epistemic ends) [are
inevitable]{.underline}. My concern is that we not neglect the
complexity of these entanglements. **[[Turning covert]{.mark} out-law
[discourses into objects of]{.mark} our [analyses]{.mark} runs the
[risk]{.mark} of [subjecting them]{.mark} both [to the gaze of the
dominant and]{.mark} to [the power relations of the
academy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the works of Michel Foucault
(especially 1979, 1980) aptly illustrate, practices presented as
extending such noble goals as emancipation and humanity may endow
institutions of confinement and objectification. Any justification for
studying out-law dis- course because doing so may extend our political
usefulness in the pursuit of emancipatory goals must not obscure the
already existing power relations authorizing such studies. Our attempts
to extend our domains of knowledge and expertise (authority) must not be
pursued unreflexively.

What conversation is there to be had around that? It is as if the mere
existence of her identity inoculates her from any critique. How did we
get here? --- Freddie DeBoer makes a great point in his piece on what he
calls "critique drift": "This all largely descends from a related
condition: [many in the]{.underline} broad online [left
have]{.underline} adopted [a norm where being an ally means that you
never critique people who are]{.underline} presumed to be [speaking from
your side]{.underline}, and [especially if]{.underline} they are seen as
[speaking from a position of greater oppression. I understand the need
for solidarity]{.underline}, I understand [the problem of
undermining]{.underline} and derailing, [and]{.underline} I recognize
why [people]{.underline} feel strongly that those [who have
traditionally been silenced should be given a position of
privilege]{.underline} in our conversations. [But critique drift
demonstrates why [a]{.mark} healthy]{.underline}, [[functioning]{.mark}
political [movement **can't forbid** **tactical criticism** of those
with whom you largely agree]{.mark}. Because critical vocabulary and
political arguments are common intellectual property which gain or lose
power based on their communal use, [never criticizing]{.mark} those who
misuse them ultimately [disarms the left. Refusing to say '**this**
is]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} thing, [but you are not]{.mark} being fair or
[helpful in making **that** accusation]{.mark} right now'
[alienates]{.mark} potential [allies, contributes to]{.mark} the
burgeoning [backlash against social justice]{.mark} politics, [and
prevents]{.mark} us from making the most **[accurate, cogent
critique]{.mark}** possible."]{.underline} Look, I am Black. Also,
sometimes, I can be wrong. Those two things are not mutually exclusive,
and [yet we have gotten to a point where any critique of tactics used by
oppressed communities can result in being deemed "sexist/racist/insert
oppression here-ist"]{.underline} and cast out of the Social Justice
Magic Circle. And listen, maybe that is cool with some folks. Maybe the
revolution that so many of these types speak about will simply consist
of everyone spontaneously coming to consciousness and there will be no
need for coalitions, give-and-take, or contact with people who do not
know every word or phrase that these groups use as some sort of litmus
test for the unwashed. But for the rest of us who reside in a
reality-based world, where every social interaction is not tailored for
your idiosyncratic indignations, we know that casting folks out for the
tiniest of offenses will lead to a Left that will forever be
marginalized and ineffective. I have stated before that the kind of
people who put out these lists and engage in the kind of identitarian
caterwauling that has become rote copy on the Internet might actually
want that, [as a world where left-wing [activism]{.mark} is [made
**potent** and **transformative**]{.mark} will be one where they
[cannot]{.mark} simply [take comfort in their
cocoon]{.mark}]{.underline} of self-righteousness. But damn them when I
can turn on my computer and see one Black person after another being
gunned down by police. Damn them when we have a president that can sit
there with a straight face and speak the words of freedom and liberation
while using the power at his disposal to deny those very concepts to
others. And damn them when we can get thousands of words on Patricia
Arquette drunk at a party or how it is privileged to not like the same
musicians that they do, but we cannot seem to get any thoughts on how
the biggest moment for communities of color since the 1960s is being
squandered in a hail of intergenerational squabbling. And do not even
get me started on people writing articles that malign long-standing
activist organizations without a whiff of evidence that there has been
any wrongdoing on their part.

[[risks the **legal consequence of punishment**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
~~He~~ knows that and goes ahead: ~~he~~ is not deterred from
considerations of (what he believes to be ~~his~~) duty by

which he is acting to risk punishment for it. Can ~~he~~ complain if he
takes the risk and loses? [[If I **choose to break one of society\'s

right to break the rule]{.underline} (under certain conditions), [even
that I [had a **duty to break it**, is one thing; claiming a right to
break it **with immunity** is another]{.mark};]{.underline} and the
first does not carry the second with it. And [that is where I am
inclined to think that the appearance of consistency by the amnesty
demanders breaks down. For what they are doing is demanding to be
protected from the risk of punishment,]{.underline} not by taking the
usual precautions to minimize the risk, but [[by **demanding the right
not to be punished**]{.mark}. They are, as it were, **complaining in
advance** about being punished. [It is not all right both to take that
risk and to make a claim not to be exposed to it]{.mark}. A claim for
amnesty, made on behalf of others, may be right; but it has to be wrong

**Phelan 6** -- Peggy Phelan, Chair of New York University\'s Department
of Performance Studies, "Unmarked: The Politics of Performance", in
Visual Culture: Experiences in Visual Culture, p. 146-149

[[Performance's only life is in the present. Performance cannot]{.mark}
be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise [participate in the
circulation of representations of representations: once it does]{.mark}
so, [it becomes something other]{.mark} than performance. [To the
degree]{.mark} that [performance attempts to enter the economy of
reproduction it betrays]{.mark} and lessens the promise of [its own
ontology]{.mark}.]{.underline} Performance's being, like the ontology of
subjectivity proposed here, becomes itself through disappearance. [The
pressures brought to bear on performance to succumb to]{.underline} the
laws of **[the reproductive economy]{.underline}** [are
enormous]{.underline}. [For only rarely in this culture is the "now" to
which performance addresses its deepest questions]{.underline}
[valued]{.underline}. (This is why the now is supplemented and
buttressed by the documenting camera, the video archive.) Performance
occurs over a time which will not be repeated. It can be performed
again, but this repetition itself marks it as "different." [The document
of a performance then is only a spur to memory, an encouragement of
memory to become present]{.underline}. The other arts, especially
painting and photography, are drawn increasingly toward performance. The
French-born artist Sophie Calle, for example, has photographed the
galleries of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Several
valuable paintings were stolen from the museum in 1990. Calle
interviewed various visitors and members of the muse um staff, asking
them to describe the stolen paintings. She then transcribed these texts
and placed them next to the photographs of the galleries. Her work
suggests that the descriptions and memories of the paintings constitute
their continuing "presence," despite the absence of the paintings
themselves. [Calle gestures toward a notion of the interactive [exchange
between]{.mark} the [art]{.mark} object [and]{.mark} the
[viewer]{.mark}. While such exchanges are often recorded as the stated
goals of museums and galleries, the institutional effect of the gallery
often seems to [put the masterpiece under house arrest, controlling
all]{.mark} conflicting and unprofessional [commentary about
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} The speech act of memory and description
(Austin's constative utterance) becomes a performative expression when
Calle places these commentaries within the 147 representation of the
museum. The descriptions fill in, and thus supplement (add to, defer,
and displace) the stolen paintings. The fact that these descriptions
vary considerably---even at times wildly---only lends credence to the
fact that the interaction between the art object and the spectator is,
essentially, performative---and therefore resistant to the claims of
validity and accuracy endemic to the discourse of reproduction. While
the art historian of painting must ask if there production is accurate
and clear, Calle asks where seeing and memory forget the object itself
and enter the subject's own set of personal meanings and associations.
Further her work suggests that the forgetting(or stealing) of the object
is a fundamental energy of its descriptive recovering. The description
itself does not reproduce the object, it rather helps us to restage and
restate the effort to remember what is lost. The descriptions remind us
how loss acquires meaning and generates recovery---not only of and for
the object, but for the one who remembers. The disappearance of the
object is fundamental to performance; it rehearses and repeats the
disappearance of the subject who longs always to be remembered. For her
contribution to the Dislocations show at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York in 1991, Calle used the same idea but this time she asked curators,
guards, and restorers to describe paintings that were on loan from the
permanent collection. She also asked them to draw small pictures of
their memories of the paintings. She then arranged the texts and
pictures according to the exact dimensions of the circulating paintings
and placed them on the wall where the actual paintings usually hang.
Calle calls her piece Ghosts, and as the visitor discovers Calle's work
spread throughout the museum, it is as if Calle's own eye is following
and tracking the viewer as she makes her way through the museum.1
Moreover, Calle's work seems to disappear because it is dispersed
throughout the "permanent collection"---a collection which circulates
despite its "permanence." Calle's artistic contribution is a kind of
self-concealment in which she offers the words of others about other
works of art under her own artistic signature. By making visible her
attempt to offer what she does not have, what cannot be seen, Calle
subverts the goal of museum display. She exposes what the museum does
not have and cannot offer and uses that absence to generate her own
work. By placing memories in the place of paintings, Calle asks that the
ghosts of memory be seen as equivalent to "the permanent collection" of
"great works." One senses that if she asked the same people over and
over about the same paintings, each time they would describe a slightly
different painting. In this sense, Calle demonstrates the performative
quality of all seeing. 148 I [Performance in a strict ontological sense
is nonreproductive]{.underline}. It is this quality which makes
performance the runt of the litter of contemporary art. [[Performance
clogs the smooth machinery of reproductive representation necessary to
the circulation of capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps nowhere was the
affinity between the ideology of capitalism and art made more manifest
than in the debates about the funding policies for the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA).2 Targeting both photography and
performance art, conservative politicians sought to prevent endorsing
the "real" bodies implicated and made visible by these art forms.
Performance implicates the real through the presence of living bodies.
In performance art spectatorship there is an element of consumption:
there are no left-overs, the gazing spectator must try to take
everything in. Without a copy, live performance plunges into
visibility---in a maniacally charged present---and disappears into
memory, into the realm of invisibility and the unconscious where it
eludes regulation and control. Performance resists the balanced
circulations of finance. It saves nothing; it only spends. While
photography is vulnerable to charges of counterfeiting and copying,
performance art is vulnerable to charges of valuelessness and emptiness.
Performance indicates the possibility of revaluing that emptiness; this
potential revaluation gives performance art its distinctive oppositional
edge.3 To attempt to write about the undocumentable event of performance
is to invoke the rules of the written document and thereby alter the
event itself. Just as quantum physics discovered that macro-instruments
cannot measure microscopic particles without transforming those
particles, so too must performance critics realize that the labor to
write about performance (and thus to "preserve" it) is also a labor that
fundamentally alters the event. It does no good, however, to simply
refuse to write about performance because of this inescapable
transformation. The challenge raised by the ontological claims of
performance for writing is to re-mark again the performative
possibilities of writing itself. The act of writing toward
disappearance, rather than the act of writing toward preservation, must
remember that the after-effect of disappearance is the experience of
subjectivity itself. This is the project of Roland Barthes in both
Camera Lucida and Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes. It is also his
project in Empire of Signs, but in this book he takes the memory of a
city in which he no longer is, a city from which he disappears, as the
motivation for the search for a disappearing performative writing. The
trace left by that script is the meeting-point of a mutual
disappearance; shared subjectivity is possible for Barthes because two
people can recognize the same Impossible. To live for a love whose goal
is to share the Impossible is both a humbling project and an exceedingly
ambitious one, for it seeks to find connection only in that which is no
longer there. Memory. Sight. Love. It must involve a full seeing of the
Other's absence (the ambitious part), a seeing which also entails the
acknowledgment of the Other's presence (the humbling part). For to
acknowledge the Other's (always partial) presence is to acknowledge
one's own (always partial) absence. In the field of linguistics, the
performative speech act shares with the ontology of performance the
inability to be reproduced or repeated. "Being an individual and
historical act, a performative utterance cannot be repeated. Each
reproduction is a new act performed by someone who is qualified.
Otherwise, the reproduction of the performative utterance by someone
else necessarily transforms it into a constative utterance."4 149
Writing, an activity which relies on the reproduction of the Same(the
three letters cat will repeatedly signify the four-legged furry animal
with whiskers) for the production of meaning, can broach the frame of
performance but cannot mimic an art that is nonreproductive. The mimicry
of speech and writing, [[the]{.mark} strange [process by which we
put]{.mark} words in each other's mouths and [others' words in our own,
relies on a substitutional economy in which equivalencies are]{.mark}
assumed and [re-established. Performance refuses this]{.mark} system of
exchange and resists the circulatory economy fundamental to it.
Performance honors the idea that [a limited number of people]{.mark} in
a specific time/space frame [can have an experience of value which
leaves no]{.mark} visible [trace afterward. Writing about it]{.mark}
necessarily [cancels the "tracelessness" inaugurated]{.mark} within this
performative promise. Performance's [independence from]{.mark} mass
[reproduction]{.mark}, technologically, economically, and
linguistically, [is its]{.mark} greatest [strength]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But buffeted by the encroaching ideologies of capital and reproduction,
it frequently devalues this strength. Writing about performance often,
unwittingly, encourages this weakness and falls in behind the drive of
the documentary. [Performance's challenge]{.underline} to writing [is to
discover a way for repeated words to become performative utterances,
rather than]{.underline}, as Benveniste warned, [constative
utterances]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1NR\-\--AT: Stealing Labor

#### It's not taking labor -- all speech acts, including theirs, cite and use the labor of others and redeployment is inevitable. Interpret frame-subtraction as a citation of their 1AC with limited disagreement -- it's not stealing their labor, just improving on the idea

director of forensics at Wayne State University, PhD in communication
studies from Wayne State University, "IMPOSSIBLE CONVICTIONS:
CONVICTIONS AND INTENTIONALITY IN PERFORMANCE AND SWITCH-SIDE DEBATE",
Contemporary Argumentation & Debate\]

General Implications for Policy Debate What is the importance of this
speech act theory for our understanding of the nature and effect of
sincere conviction and performance in competitive debates? Academic
policy [debate operates as a speech act system]{.underline} that is in
many ways [similar to Derrida's]{.underline} idea of [citationality and
iterability]{.underline}. For instance, [[debate]{.mark} begins
with]{.underline} the construction of [arg]{.underline}ument
brief[s]{.underline} and blocks. [These]{.underline} sets of arguments
**[[combine]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[thoughts]{.underline}]{.mark}
and utterances [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} several [[experts]{.mark} and
writers]{.underline} and are [presented in a new context and time. [No
matter]{.mark} the [original intent]{.mark}]{.underline} and convictions
[of these authors]{.underline}, their ideas are now deployed in a new
manner and purpose within a debate. Also, [several team
members]{.underline} and coaches [work on]{.underline} various sets of
[blocks]{.underline} and briefs, [which means]{.underline} that [a
single student might cite]{.underline} the ideas and beliefs of over [a
dozen people in]{.underline} his/her [speech act]{.underline}.
Additionally, [debaters post]{.underline} the [citations]{.underline}
and list of arguments they presented on online case lists that allow
other debaters to borrow and use those arguments in new and different
rounds and contexts. At the end of the debate, [[judges]{.mark}
compile]{.underline} all of the [claims, warrants, and data presented in
the round and]{.underline} after rendering a decision, likely
[[recount]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[arg]{.underline}]{.mark}ument[[s]{.mark} to]{.underline} the [teams
they coach, [which redeploy]{.mark}]{.underline} these arguments well
[[beyond]{.mark} the reach of the intent and [beliefs
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[debaters who constructed the]{.mark}
original [arg]{.mark}]{.underline}ument[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} and
briefs. [Even when students' convictions]{.underline} and intentions
[are introduced]{.underline} into debate, [[it
becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} almost immediately [[difficult to determine
where students' ideas begin and where the excess of
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark} produced by the constant iteration of
utterances [[stop]{.underline}]{.mark}. While students may know their
personal beliefs, it is difficult for those beliefs to control and
contain meaning once it has uptake. Put differently, the [constant
citation]{.underline} of ideas and beliefs [always add additional
meaning]{.underline} as more voices (e.g., a quotation from an expert, a
coach's language choices on a block) and new contexts are introduced.
[[**Even if** students]{.mark} attempt to remain]{.underline} completely
[authentic by [avoid]{.mark}ing]{.underline} reference to outside
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} or their [[coaches or]{.underline}
[teammates]{.underline}]{.mark} by citing nothing other than genuine
experience in their arguments, [[this]{.mark} performance **[continues
to operate as citation]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a few reasons. First,
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[selection]{.mark} and redeployment [of
past experiences, the speech]{.mark} act [cites]{.mark} prior experience
and conventions to make]{.underline} the [experiences
communicable]{.underline}. Second, the [purely authentic [performance is
intelligible as]{.mark} a [debate argument **only because** it
references]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[competitive debate
conventions]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., it [follows time
limits]{.underline}, it [is presented as a constructive]{.underline}, it
[contains different contentions]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} the
[expectations of the judge]{.underline}. Third, [[once a debate
ends]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[students have **no control**
over]{.underline}]{.mark} what kind of [[uptake]{.underline}]{.mark}
their arguments have beyond the debate; anyone can use these arguments
in new ways and contexts. Thus, debate operates at both levels of
discourse as outlined by Austin. On one hand, debate has an expressed
political purpose of persuading the judge and perhaps inspiring and
convincing the other team at a perlocutionary level. On the other hand,
debates also produce illocutionary effects that are determined in the
uptake and circulation of arguments after and outside the debate. Both
levels are performative in that they produce an effect: winning a
ballot, changing an opinion, or even declaring an identity for oneself.
However, [what becomes]{.underline} very [difficult to assess within a
debate is]{.underline} the [authenticity and ethics of specific
utterances]{.underline}.

#### PICs affirm a strong theory of discursive agency -- rejection of PICs is far more disadvantages to the possibilities for critique

Fourth, [contemporary speech act theory provides new avenues for
permutations or citation of performances in debates. In
many]{.underline} performance [debates, it is common to
hear]{.underline} performance [[teams argue]{.mark} that opposing teams'
attempts to run]{.underline} plan/[performance-inclusive counterplans
[(PICs)]{.mark},]{.underline} permutations, or other attempts to operate
within a performative framework [[are **insincere**]{.mark},
inauthentic, or constitute a form of **intellectual
[plagiarism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Zompetti, 2004). [Put differently,
these efforts should be rejected because they are [**fake** or
**parasitic**]{.mark} performances. [However]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
Derrida (1988) contends, [efforts [to regulate]{.mark} speech acts
[with]{.mark} an **organizing center of [intention]{.mark}** or sincere
beliefs **[undermine]{.mark} the [citationality]{.mark}, excess,
[and]{.mark} structural [play of discourse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
both Derrida (1988) and Butler (1997), [[this]{.mark} approach [is
**flawed**]{.mark} for two reasons. First, the attempts to govern speech
acts will **unavoidably fail** because recirculation of discourse is
**inevitable**. Additionally, speech acts **always** produce **excess
meanings** that are **beyond our sovereign control**. Second, these
regulative approaches provide **very limited rhetorical agency** as they
reject the possibility of **re-signification**. For instance,
[without]{.mark} the possibility of [citationality]{.mark}, harmful
language **cannot be reappropriated** for new cultural and political
uses. Likewise, the **[strategic]{.mark} use of [essentialized
identities]{.mark}** [to **expose**]{.mark} the [shortcomings]{.mark} of
such representations [becomes]{.mark} nearly [impossible]{.mark} within
this perspective of communication]{.underline} (Spivak, 1996). [For
example, [**productive critiques** of **gender** and **racial**
identities through **parody** would]{.mark} likely [be
**excluded**]{.mark} if sincerity and intentions regulate acceptable
performances.]{.underline} [Additionally, if discourse is **limited in
agency** due to intentions and sincerity, then it likely has **little
power** to change reality. Simply put, one **cannot** simultaneously
posit a strong (e.g., discourse changes reality) and weak (e.g.,
discourse is severely constrained by prior beliefs and intent) theory of
discursive agency. While]{.underline} performance [teams might find the
prospect of having]{.underline} their [opponents strategically
capturing]{.underline} their [speech acts unfair, [there seems]{.mark}
to be **[greater disadvantages]{.mark}** associated [with]{.mark} the
[attempts to **strictly police** insincere
performances]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that
these teams are left with no defense against permutations, PICs, or
other capture strategies. Indeed, this review of speech act theory
suggests that the opposition's citation of the speech act must have some
discursive effect or force. While I argue that effect is rather
difficult to assess within a single debate round, Salih and Butler
(2004) provide a solution to this problem. [In discussing the
progressive potential of strategic essentialism, Salih and
Butler]{.underline} (2004) [argue that **[re-signification]{.mark}** of
representations and terms can [**operate as sites for productive
contestations** over]{.mark} the meaning and [**exclusiveness**
of]{.mark} these [identities]{.mark} and discourse. As a result, the
debate about whether or not]{.underline} permutations or [PICs of a
performance can move away from questions of conviction and intent and
instead focus on argumentative effectiveness, which could examine the
exclusions and consequences created by the differences that remain
between the]{.underline} performance [team and]{.underline} their
[opponents' orientations. Put rather simply, the debate returns to a
question of net-benefits rather than one of mutual exclusivity regulated
by true beliefs. Thus, the **[desire to exclude]{.mark}**]{.underline}
permutations and **[[PICs]{.underline}]{.mark}** solely [because they
are insincere **[should be rejected]{.mark}** if]{.underline}
performance [teams want [to maintain the **strong theory** of
**discursive agency**]{.mark}]{.underline} that they need in order [to
justify the impact of]{.underline} their [arguments]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1NR\-\--AT: Sincere

#### If you do believe their stance is sincere and/or you agree with it, you should reward their civil disobedience with a loss.  Punishment is key to enlisting the sympathy of the majority and ensuring the movement succeeds.

It is for this reason that [[the civil disobedient]{.underline}]{.mark}
characteristically notifies government officials of the time and place
of his actions and [[attempts to make clear the point
of]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~his~~ [[protest]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Obviously, one of the problems of a modern democracy is that many
immoral actions taken in the people\'s name are only dimly known to
them, if they are known at all. In such cases, the main difficulty in
touching the public\'s conscience may well be the difficulty in making
the public conscious. The civil disobedient may therefore find that in
addition to making his actions public it is necessary to gain for them a
wide publicity as well. Indeed, Bertrand Russell has suggested that
making propaganda and bringing the facts of political life to the
attention of an ignorant and often bemused electorate constitute the
main functions of disobedience at the present time.3 It is certainly
true that [[nothing attracts]{.mark} the [attention]{.mark} of the
masses,]{.underline} and of the mass media, [[like]{.mark} **flamboyant
[violations of the law]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and it would be
unrealistic of those who have political grievances not to exploit this
fact. But [it is important]{.underline}, especially in this connection,
[to recall Gandhi\'s warning that the technique of law violation ought
to be used sparingly,]{.underline} like the surgeon\'s knife. [For in
the end the public will lose its will, and indeed its ability, to
distinguish between those who employ these techniques whenever they wish
to advertise their political opinions **and** those, **the true
dissenters,** who use them only to protest deep violations of political
principle. The techniques will **then be of little use to anybody**.
[After openly breaking the law, the traditional disobedient **willingly
pays the penalty**. This is **one of the characteristics**
that]{.mark}]{.underline} serve to distinguish him from the typical
criminal (his appeal to conscience is another), and it [[helps to
establish the seriousness]{.underline}]{.mark} of ~~his~~ views [[and
the depth of]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~his~~
[[commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} as well. Unfortunately, paying the
penalty will not always demonstrate that his actions are in fact
disinterested. For the [youth protesting the draft]{.underline} or the
welfare recipient protesting poverty [has [an obvious and substantial
interest]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [success]{.underline} of his cause.
[**If the majority suspects** that these **interests** [color the
disobedient\'s perception of the issues involved, its suspicions may
prove **fatal** to]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~his~~ **[[ultimate
success]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is one reason why the practice of
civil disobedience should not be limited to those who are directly
injured by the government\'s immoral or lawless course (as Judge
Wyzanski and others have suggested).4 [A show of support by those who
have no substantial interest in the matter may carry special weight with
a confused, and even with an actively skeptical, majority.]{.underline}
The majority simply cannot dismiss those over thirty-five as draft
dodgers, or those who earn over thirty-five thousand dollars a year as
boondogglers. It may therefore consider the issues at stake, and this is
the first objective of the civil disobedient.

### Becoming War K

#### Subjectivity has only ever been defined by the ontological crack between the representational and the machinic, self-awareness and the neural wiring of the brain. In contrast to their machinic ontology of "becoming," "deterritorialization," and "quantum flux," we adopt an ontology of the Lack, one that forefronts the inevitable linguistic split at the heart of the subject. Despite their affective calls to militarize subjectivity, their politics of differential ontology can only ever blow apart the rift in subjectivity, leaving behind a desubjectified humanity in the wake of becoming. Only a politics that begins from the position of the void can ever hope to provide freedom for the subject. 

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 91-96)//JRD

The reduction of the postmodern subject from the high Renaissance
estimation of man at the pinnacle of creation is almost complete:
through Copernicus, Darwin, Freud, Marx and Nietzsche, to the emergence
of the subject as pure immaterial void. [Notwithstanding the turn
towards appearances with phenomenology]{.underline} (albeit without
substantial realities "behind" them), [notions such as autopoeisis, the
"emerging properties" of systems, events e-venting themselves,
self-organising phenomena, quantum phenomena and the autonomy of pure
flux events, the ontology of pure becoming]{.underline} -- [these are
all part and parcel of the de-substantialised "reality," which barely
recovers some last flickers of subjectivity as the not-quitenothing of
contemporary theory. The brain--machine interface implies devices that
can realise Orwellian thought control, surveillance, communication, and
so on, the prospect of post-human "undead" virtual entities, the
blurring of the distinction between hardware]{.underline} (brain) [and
software]{.underline} (mind), [with the latter being able to detach from
the former completely and enter the virtual.]{.underline} [Of particular
fascination is the parallax between brain chemistry and
consciousness.]{.underline} Everything experienced has
neurophysiological correlates. For instance, brain processes accompany
intense religious experiences. However, [the question of causality
remains unresolved]{.underline}. Taking an ecstasy pill creates in the
user a feeling of ecstatic love towards the other. How does this
short-cut compare to a religious training and spiritual devotion over a
lifetime that might produce "naturally" similar experiences? Consider,
for instance, the dour father, melancholic most of his life, who, on his
deathbed is given morphine to relieve pain and seems cheerful,
good-humoured and loving, for the first time in his life! Does the
morphine neurophysiologically transform the father on his deathbed into
this "loving" man, or does it merely facilitate a very moving loving
last gesture ("choice") at the final moment, that was always buried
within this depressed man? Žižek cites Taylor's "skating" analogy of
consciousness.[20 Taylor understands consciousness as a relational
phenomenon where past memories, representations, emotions are used to
fill in and inform present sensory imputs.]{.underline} [This triggers a
host of related activities endowing the mental process with
substantiality, which, at some critical point, "lifts" the original
input into a new arena]{.underline}, like the skater who having launched
himself onto the ice glides off effortlessly. [Thus, consciousness
emerges released from the "friction" of the processing stages.
Consciousness floats free when a threshold is crossed. Therefore, there
is no consciousness without selfconsciousness.]{.underline} [The "I"
emerges as the self-relating interaction between present input and past.
The "self" is this escape into the fluid field of awareness and
de-centring, creating the impossibility of the I's immediate
self-presence.]{.underline} [Consciousness spins off from the substrate
that created it. 'A new quasi-object thus emerges']{.underline} (213),
[the final states of which involve "attractor nets" which attract
initial activity to become similar to their own, but remain
insubstantial as they were created, posited and generated by the very
substrates which react and interact to them in endless feedback loops.
So subject and object]{.underline} (attractor) [are almost
one.]{.underline} [The all-important minimal "gap" is also the
programmed space for freedom. Thus, there is no subject prior to neural
activity; no top-down, only bottom-up effects.]{.underline} Žižek
emphasises, '[cognitive scientists repeat again and again how our mind
does not possess a centralised control structure which runs top-down ...
it is rather a bricolage of multiple agents who collaborate
bottom-up']{.underline} (241). [The self is its own self-ing,
unaware]{.underline}21 [of the steps towards its own emerging, for good
evolutionary reasons to do with the necessity of rapid autopoietic
information processing.]{.underline} So when Žižek concludes that 'as
true Freudians, we should reject the notion of "Me" as a substantial
background of the ego' (217), he is following Lacan and indeed
Winnicott, whose understanding of "aliveness" is a similar process of
emergence via relating and "primary illusionment."22  [This is thinking
the unthinkable to Western minds -- a self-less world, living as being
no one -- forgetting that for two and a half millennia]{.underline},
Buddhist enlightenment has been practising the assumption of non-being.
[How do we get from passive primary illusionment, or the assumption of
"non-being," to something more active to do with subjectivity? Or how
does self-consciousness arise amidst and minimally separate from being
potentially overwhelmed by billions of neural data?]{.underline} [The
answer seems to be by some process of negation or by some malfunction or
fault in the nature of the smooth running of the system, otherwise we
would be no more than passive processing machines. Maybe
self-consciousness is stumbled upon through an "ontological
crack"]{.underline} (242) [in "reality" itself, which enables one to
say: YES, I AM HERE, over and against being a passive]{.underline}
[(unconscious) recipient of neuronal impulses.]{.underline} [Žižek
dramatises this crack by reference to a traumatic excess, through an
"error" that creates a measure of freedom.]{.underline} [The Cartesian
consciousness of pure reflection that gets caught up in emotion is the
price the mind has to pay for being lumbered with a body.]{.underline}
[Consciousness emerges through the disturbance of the organism's
homeostasis. Consciousness is the activity of dealing with
disturbances.]{.underline} For Damasio, for instance, 'the core you is
only born as the story is told, within the very story itself ... You are
the music while the music lasts'.23 In Lacanian terms, [the subject is
the 'answer of the Real']{.underline} (225). [The subject has the
possibility of answering for the Real.]{.underline} Žižek recalls the
joke about the patient in a large hospital ward who complains to the
doctor about constant noise and crying from the other patients. The
doctor replies that nothing can be done to prevent these suffering
people from expressing their despair, since they know they are dying.
The patient then asks why they cannot be put in a separate room for the
dying. And the doctor replies that this is the separate room for the
dying. However, [Žižek believes]{.underline} that Damasio leaves out of
consideration [the 'proper empty core of subjectivity', radically
exposed as it is, not to mere life experience, but also to affects such
as anxiety and horror; 'anxiety as correlative to confronting the Void
that forms the core of the subject; horror as the experience of
disgusting life at its purest, "undead" life']{.underline} (227). Here
again, Žižek is asserting the Lacanian void. [Not life experience as it
teems forth with Deleuze and Guattari to blow apart the constraining
Symbolic, but more like]{.underline} Badiou's '[from nothing to
nothing', the awareness of the raw flesh and blood body.]{.underline}
When the subject is violently attacked, for instance, the emotional
response is such that the cortical areas of the brain focus on the
stimulus and inhibit interest in sex and food. Such [stressors over
evolutionary time have acted to accelerate the development of our
cognitive and behavioural capacities, not least our acquisition of
language, "placed" as it is between these higher capacities and our
emotional sub-systems.]{.underline} Žižek emphasises this all-important
structural "gap" in connectivity between cognitive systems and language
on the one hand, and emotional abilities on the other. [This gap, or
point of "failure," where emotions lag behind cognition, defines our
humanity. In the absence of the gap humans would be
machines.]{.underline} To be specific and crucial for our argument[,
human emotions (like anxiety) arise when the human animal loses its
footing in biological functioning, requiring this loss to be
supplemented inadequately 'by the symbolically regulated emotions qua
man's "second nature"']{.underline} (228). Or to put it another way:
[imagine that our emotions and cognitive abilities precisely coincided,
with no lag or gap: was this not our central concern with the desiring
machines in their machinic-ness?]{.underline} [Rather than being human,
representational and failing, they seemed inhuman, presentational --
perfectly functioning monstrosities, incapable of anxiety and concern,
because the subject was reduced to a vestigial parasite of no
consequence.]{.underline} In addition, animals themselves are not
machines, because of a similar but narrower gap between their biological
instincts and cognitive abilities. The gap indeed may be a measure of
our evolutionary ascendancy, with lowly insects, for instance, being
more or less indistinguishable from machines, with their robotic
creepy-crawliness capable, for that reason, of inspiring fear and
anxiety. [This gives a new significance to the gaps or lacks of the
analytic session, the space to speak, the creation of silence,
punctuation and so on, in order to lessen the machinic automaticity of
alienated speech/action, and to increase "human" qualities for
reflection which can occur only in the division of the
subject.]{.underline} It is no exaggeration to say that Freud's
invention of the psychoanalytic space therefore is linked to
civilisation itself. [Without this reflective-gap-pause between the
drives and manifest behaviour, there is no civility.]{.underline} As
Damasio says, 'Memory, language, and intelligence make the difference,
not emotion'.24 This subject, Descartes' cogito, Kant's transcendental
subject, is exposed to the drive per se; to affects -- potentially, raw
anxiety, panic and horror. As suggested, [all "human" suffering rests in
this void of the pure subject. In this gap between the pre-Symbolic Real
of the biological machinery of emotion and the Symbolised feelings of
the autobiographical self lie everything that must be defended in this
work: the sense of the tragic, the melancholic, the human -- pity,
empathy and compassion, followed by the critical necessity for the
elaboration of language]{.underline} (the treasure house of signifiers)
qua containing and subjectivising of affect, the telling of dreams,
stories, narratives, etc. [All the contemporary trends,]{.underline} as
we have stressed, [point in the reverse direction towards the inhuman --
core unmediated machinic "experience"]{.underline} -- paroxysms of sex,
[convulsions of violence]{.underline}, pitilessness, autism, [jouissance
and the death drive.]{.underline}

#### Their "becoming war" is exactly what good little capitalists strive to enjoy

Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 64-70)//JRD

It follows from this that the primary line of social critique launched
against capitalist society would focus on society's failure to live up
to its ideology. It is a truism of Marxist analysis --- especially aft
er the Frankfurt School --- to suggest that [capitalist ideology uses
the image of successful accumulation in order to hide the lack of
accumulation that most subjects endure and thereby produce
docility.]{.underline} According to this position, [images of
enjoyment]{.underline}, such as Hollywood f lms, [create a false or
illusory pleasure that helps to satisfy otherwise dissatisfied
subjects.]{.underline} While entranced by the romantic bond between
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman or between Ashton Kutcher and Natalie
Portman, **[capitalist subjects do not think about their position within
the capitalist order of things.]{.underline}** **[These subjects invest
themselves in the image of enjoyment rather than in the real
thing.]{.underline}** This is why Theodor Adorno claims that "all mass
culture is fundamentally adaptation."23 [The promulgation of the image
of enjoyment]{.underline}, for Adorno and the Frankfurt School, [becomes
capitalist ideology's way of creating subjects who believe that they are
enjoying themselves while existing within the intractable
dissatisfaction of capitalism. In the face of capitalist ideology's
proliferation of such images, the task for the critical thinker becomes
one of tearing them apart, exposing the lack of enjoyment at the heart
of them and showing how]{.underline}, as Adorno and Max Horkheimer make
clear in their Dialectic of Enlightenment, [capitalism and its
ideological handmaiden]{.underline}, the culture industry, [never really
deliver.]{.underline}24 According to this view, [capitalist subjects
aren't really enjoying themselves despite feeling that they
are.]{.underline} Such subjects actually exist in a state of perpetual
dissatisfaction, and Adorno and Horkheimer hope to expose this
dissatisfaction for what it is in order to create a revolutionary
consciousness akin to their own. For Marxist thinkers like those of the
Frankfurt School, [the chief problem with capitalism is that it promises
an enjoyment without ever delivering on that promise (even to those who
seem taken care of by the capitalist system). But there is a further
problem that this critique doesn't touch --- the alignment of
accumulation and enjoyment.]{.underline} Few Marxist thinkers have
questioned this link. In fact, [the primary aim of the Marxist project
seems to be expanding or equalizing accumulation while retaining it as
the source of enjoyment.]{.underline} This attitude stems in large part
from Marx's own privileging of production and his vision of the
Communist revolution as an unleashing of the means of production. [In
contrast to capitalism, in which the restricted relations of production
erect a barrier to the expansion of the unrestricted means of
production, Communism would lift all such restrictions and allow for
excess production without restraint --- and thus enjoyment without
limit.]{.underline} [The ideal of enjoyment without limit is visible in
the politics articulated by many recent and contemporary thinkers
influenced by Marx. One can see it in Gilles Deleuze and Félix
Guattari's call for decoded flows]{.underline}, [Alain Badiou's plea for
more development of technology, and Paolo Virno's embrace of dissolved
boundaries.]{.underline}25 [These visions of the future involve
accepting the fundamental premise of capitalist ideology --- its
privileging of accumulation --- but there is a countervailing movement
within Marx's own thought that hints at a more radical critique of the
capitalist system.]{.underline} By examining this other dimension of
Marx's thought, [we can see the relationship between enjoyment and
pleasure as it operates within capitalist society and observe how a
politics of the death drive would intervene in this relationship Finding
Our Lost Enjoyment At times]{.underline}, Marx indicates how [the
capitalist mode of production transforms the driving force of human
activity]{.underline}, and he implicitly envisions Communism as a
corrective to this transformation. [The drive to accumulate, in this
view, ceases to be a drive inherent in human subjectivity itself, and an
alternative becomes visible.]{.underline} In the second volume of
Capital, Marx almost articulates the position of psychoanalytic
emancipatory politics directly when he says, "[For capitalism is already
essentially abolished once we assume that it is enjoyment that is the
driving motive and not enrichment itself]{.underline}."26 Here, [the
distinction between enjoyment and enrichment as motives for action
divides capitalism from other unmentioned economic systems. The
alternative to accumulation is]{.underline} satisfaction --- or, more
specifically, the recognition of our satisfaction. the fundamental
problem with capitalism is this: it doesn't allow us to recognize our
enjoyment or even to grasp enjoyment as what drives us. [It's not that
capitalism deprives us of the satisfaction]{.underline} involved with
thinking, loving, theorizing, singing, painting, and fencing (to use
Marx's examples cited above) [but that it doesn't allow us to view
satisfaction as a possible motive for our acts. We can think of the
drive for enjoyment or a drive centered around enjoyment as a
possibility existing outside of the capitalist system. T is drive ---
the death drive --- would have no purpose other than enjoyment, which is
to say that it would operate in contrast to the accumulative logic of
the capitalist drive. The capitalist drive to accumulate represents a
distortion of the death drive, a rewriting of it that changes its
structure. But the capitalist drive to accumulate does not simply do
away with enjoyment. As a rewriting of the death drive, it continues to
provide the enjoyment that this drive does, though this drive to
accumulate makes it more diffi cult for subjects to identify the site
where they enjoy. Our investment in capitalism doesn't occur through a
complete neglect of our enjoyment but depends in a fundamental way on
its ability to deliver enjoyment. **If capitalist subjects weren't
actually enjoying themselves at all, they would not continue to be
capitalist subjects.**]{.underline} We really do enjoy ourselves within
the capitalist universe --- the death drive continues to function ---
but we don't enjoy in the way that capitalist ideology tries to convince
us that we do. Political struggle is not simply a struggle over the
right to enjoy certain goods and the distribution of this right. It is
also --- even predominantly --- a struggle over how we identify and
locate our enjoyment. Capitalist ideology is triumphant today because it
has won this struggle. [As capitalist subjects, we must define enjoyment
in terms of accumulation: one enjoys insofar as one accumulates objects
of desire.]{.underline} This definition has become ubiquitous: according
to the prevailing logic today, even the enjoyment that derives from
romance comes from acquiring one's object of desire. But this is not the
only way of figuring enjoyment. [One of the most important political
tasks for emancipatory politics today consists in transforming our way
of thinking about enjoyment --- breaking the link that capitalist
ideology has forged between accumulation and enjoyment. At every turn,
capitalist ideology works to persuade subjects that their enjoyment
derives from acquiring and having objects of desire. As a result,
popular fantasies place most of their focus on the moments when subjects
obtain these objects.]{.underline} Rather than emphasizing the points at
which a couple struggles through the quotidian aspects of their
relationship, the typical Hollywood romance stresses the moment of the
couple's union. The entirety of Sleepless in Seattle (Nora Ephron, 1993)
builds to the climactic embrace of the long-separated couple, and this
embrace, according to the logic of the film, provides us as spectators
with the ultimate enjoyment. The final embrace is the high point (the
point at which each lover has the love object), and we leave the theater
convinced that this embrace, this union, is the source of our enjoyment.
In this way, the very structure of popular fantasies today underlines
the link between acquisition and enjoyment. The problem with this stress
on the enjoyment of accumulation is not simply that it tends to produce
a destructive society with egoistic subjects (though it certainly does)
but that it doesn't really work. When we watch a film like Sleepless in
Seattle, our enjoyment --- if we have any at all --- does not in fact
derive from the moment when the lovers obtain their love objects. To
understand where to locate our enjoyment of the film, we must observe
the rigid distinction between enjoyment and pleasure. [Pleasure
occurs]{.underline}, for Freud, [with a release of excitation, when we
are able to overcome the barriers in the way of realizing our desire for
this release. While pleasure provides a good feeling and a sense of
well-being, enjoyment uproots us and disturbs our
well-being.]{.underline} We have pleasures, but enjoyment, in some
sense, has us. Though the proper spectator clearly experiences pleasure
at the conclusion of Sleepless in Seattle, she or he does not enjoy at
this point. Instead, this marks the moment at which our enjoyment
dissipates. We enjoy the events leading up to the denouement --- the
struggles of each character with the absence of the object --- not the
acquisition of the object itself. the moment of acquiring the object
represents the end, not the beginning, of our enjoyment, though it does
mark the point at which we experience the most pleasure. There is a link
between Freud's conception of the pleasure principle as the motivating
force of human activity and the capitalist drive to accumulate. In both
cases, the focus is on the end point --- either the psyche ridding
itself of stimulation and achieving pleasure or the subject obtaining
capital and commodities in order to have things to enjoy without worry.
But what distinguishes them is their diff erent ways of envisioning the
end point: according to the logic of the pleasure principle, the subject
works to eliminate excitation, and according to that of the capitalist
drive, the subject tries to increase excitation through the acquisition
of more and more commodities. We might reconcile the two positions by
thinking of acquisition as a way of calming psychic excitation while
enhancing the possibilities for physical excitation. If one has enough
capital, one might avoid disturbing thoughts about losing it. But
sustaining the homology between the psychoanalytic conception of
motivation and the drive to accumulate becomes impossible when we turn
from the pleasure principle to the death drive as the fundamental
psychoanalytic category. Before 1920 Freud identifies enjoyment and
pleasure; he sees enjoyment as the product of the activity of the
pleasure principle. As he puts it in "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes"
in 1915, "The aim \[Zeil\] of an instinct is in every instance
satisfaction, which can only be obtained by removing the state of
stimulation at the source of the instinct."27 Satisfaction or enjoyment
results from eliminating stimulation, which is precisely what the
pleasure principle demands. After writing Beyond the Pleasure Principle,
however, Freud ceases to credit the pleasure principle with being the
primary explanatory category for human activity.28 He retains pleasure
as a category, but the death drive dislodges it from its foundational
place. Rather than explaining human activity itself, the pleasure
principle begins to function as a supplement to the death drive as an
explanatory category. Pleasure supplements the death drive by providing
a lure for consciousness. The subject actively takes up the path of the
death drive --- a drive that uses the subject and produces enjoyment at
the cost of the subject's well-being or self-interest --- because
moments of pleasure render it bearable and even attractive. But this
pleasure can only be imaginary: it is more the image of a future
pleasure to be obtained than an actual pleasure experienced. This is the
fundamental problem with the logic of accumulation and the would-be
pleasure that derives from enrichment. [Every capitalist subject has
experienced the dissatisfaction that inevitably results from actually
obtaining the desired commodity.]{.underline} As an absent object, the
object of desire appears to embody incredible pleasure, but when this
object becomes present, it devolves into an ordinary object. [In the act
of obtaining the object of desire, we deprive this object of its very
desirability. The pleasure embodied in the object exists only insofar as
it remains out of reach for the subject.]{.underline} Because we desire
the object as absent, actually obtaining the object provokes
disappointment rather than pleasure. No matt er how pleasurable the
presence of the object is, this presence never offers us what we desired
in the object. [The great lie of capitalist ideology is its insistence
that one can enjoy the act of accumulation itself.]{.underline} This act
inevitably produces disappointment in the subject who buys into it, and
this disappointment is never more acute than just after what promised to
be the most satisfying acquisition. For capitalist subjects, the
disappointment that follows acquisition of a treasured commodity is not
a reason to abandon the process of accumulation. In fact, it suggests to
such subjects that they simply haven't taken accumulation far enough,
that they need more. [In this way, capitalist ideology feeds off the
disappointment that it produces.]{.underline} If it actually produced
the ultimate enjoyment for subjects that it promised them, they would no
longer feel compelled to enter into the process of accumulation. After a
little accumulation, subjects would become satisfied and thereby cease
to be capitalist subjects, properly speaking. [Capitalism needs
dissatisfied subjects, but it also needs subjects who believe that the
ultimate satisfaction is possible. This is accomplished by locating the
ultimate satisfaction in the act of accumulation. Subjects invest
themselves in capitalist ideology because they accept its map of
enjoyment. The key to combating this ideology lies not in undermining
the fantasies that it proffers but in revealing where our enjoyment is
located, in proffering a different map. Rather than enjoying the process
of accumulation, we enjoy the experience of loss --- the loss of the
privileged object.]{.underline} Accumulation allows us to have objects,
but it doesn't allow us to have the object in its absence. This is why
accumulation always leads not to satisfaction with what one has but to
the desire to accumulate more and more. [Loss, in contrast, permits us
to experience the object as such. Th rough the act of losing the
privileged object, we in effect cause this privileged object to emerge.
Th ere is no privileged object prior to its loss. Understood in this
way, loss becomes a creative act. the loss of the object is the
foundation of our enjoyment because this act elevates an object above
the rest of the world and embodies that object with the power to satisfy
us]{.underline}

#### Their anti-oedipal politics are nothing more than a modality of mimesis -- the aggressive distaste for the uncastrated subject in opposition to the self.

[In the absence of landmarks -- the Law, Oedipus, the Symbolic register
and civilisation itself, there is nothing for it but to collapse
backwards into imaginary rivalry and the escalating violence of the war
machines.]{.underline}49 [It is only the Law and the thin seam or
stratum of civilisation that stands guard over and against the (violent)
jouissance of the BwO, and all the desiccated and de-structured remains
of the molecularised aborted institutions]{.underline}, [the bricks on
the ground, the bodies strewn about, the fires still
burning.]{.underline} And [for those who correctly point out that the
Law itself is founded on violence and maintained by violence, let them
compare this "violence of normality"]{.underline} with Mogadishu (1993),
Sarajevo (1992), Rwanda (1994), Phnom Penh (17 April 1975), Srebrenica
(1995), Grozny (1999--2000), Darfur (2003--), Baghdad (2003--11),
Misrata (April 2011), Homs (2012), [all in the hellish nonstriated grip
of their various war machines which show no pity and that is in just the
last quarter century.]{.underline} At this point, we will turn our
attention to a theorist of war, René Girard. From his early work on
literary theory and criticism, Girard turned his attention to
anthropology and the primitive mythological origins of violence and the
means of its cessation. In his key text, Violence and the Sacred, 50
written coincidentally in the same year as Anti-Oedipus, [Girard
underlines the ubiquity of violence in primitive societies, like our
authors' theorising of the nomadic war machines.]{.underline} Girard,
however, draws attention specifically to the mimetic character of
violence. [Envy is the response to ontological lack; jealousy and
resentment of what the other has.]{.underline} Girard is unnecessarily
critical of psychoanalysis when much of his theorising amplifies both
what Freud emphasised about the ubiquity of the death drive and Lacan's
Hegelian-Kojévian theory of desire. Girard's explication sounds
Lacanian: 'he [\[the subject\] desires being, something he himself lacks
and which some other person seems to possess. The subject thus looks to
that other person to inform him of what he should desire in order to
acquire that being]{.underline}' (155). [We desire what the other
desires because they desire it, not because we need it, but because they
have it and we want it. Very quickly, many people will desire the same
thing, because it seems desirable. Desire mimes the other's desire; we
want the same as the other. Two key points emerge: first, desire
manifests as a social phenomenon, not just biologically rooted in the
drive; and second, desire]{.underline} (as in the "mirror stage")
[quickly becomes aggressive and rivalrous, in which case it becomes a
fight for what the other possesses, with the potential for
escalation.]{.underline} Girard likens this extremism to an infection or
pollution, or the spilling of blood. [Our perceiving evil in the other
and the violent measures taken to combat it, inevitably converge sowing
chaos and destruction. So-called "mimetic violence" will only be
controlled, not by counterviolence]{.underline}, [but by]{.underline}
religion, i.e. by sacred rituals involving [the killing of a
scapegoat -- an unimportant third party who can "safely" be sacrificed
to defuse the crisis which is tearing apart the social
fabric.]{.underline} [The scapegoat must be foreign, an enemy or
"other," designated by the warring factions as sufficiently different so
that his death does not lead to more killings within the society. The
sacrifice is a sacred duty, a perfect cover for the violence of the act,
the true logic of which must never be disclosed to the participants.
**The so-called "bad" violence of the warring factions will be countered
only by the "good" violence of a sacrifice that will end the chain
reactions of violent reprisals.**]{.underline} As if taking his cue from
psychoanalyst Matte Blanco, Girard demonstrates again and again how
[violence becomes symmetrical, reciprocal, eliminating difference as the
combatants become mirror images of each other, "monstrous doubles," with
their tit-for-tat killings, spreading throughout the
community.]{.underline} For instance, Oedipus, Creon, Laius, Tiresias,
taking their cue from the oracle, each seek the other's downfall. [Each
becomes similarly and symmetrically violent. Oedipus is selected as the
sacrificial victim, because he alone is regarded as guilty of patricide
and incest. He is the monstrous exception. Oedipus becomes the
repository of all the community's ills, to be done away with in order
for peace to return.]{.underline}51 Likewise here, [the anti-Oedipals
unite in their hatred of Oedipus, who therefore must be sacrificed.
Oedipus is scapegoated because he wasn't sufficiently anti-Oedipal, thus
remaining a tragic divided figure.]{.underline} [The list of potential
sacrificial victims is varied]{.underline}: prisoners of war, slaves,
adolescents, children, the handicapped, [anyone sufficiently
different]{.underline}, sufficiently other from Pharmakós to King,
[might be selected for sacrifice.]{.underline} Twins are regarded as
impure and demonic especially if identical. Other potential victims
include a warrior steeped in blood, an incestuous couple, menstruating
women, and so on. Recalling our argument, [the erotic eliminates
difference, celebrates confusion, because it allows for the "return of
the repressed" and thus provokes counter-cathectic violence against such
"evil."]{.underline} This recalls Laplanche's "sexual death drive"
theory,52 and George Bataille's erotic.53 As Girard says, ['naked or
pure sexuality is directly connected to violence. It is the final veil
shielding violence from sight']{.underline} (122). [Violence once
started creates an orgy of destruction. Violence is con-fusion,
difference is eliminated: between god and non-god; between man and
woman; parent and child -- 'a hallucinatory state that is not a
synthesis of elements, but a formless and grotesque mixture of things
that are normally separate']{.underline} (169). [This is anti-Oedipus,
everything is reduced via mixing to the sameness of shit! Violence has
this eviscerating effect. Our authors, averse to key Oedipal
differentiations]{.underline} (mother, father. child, brother, sister,
etc.), [celebrate contagion. Differentiation, on the other hand,
establishes culture, peace with the "violence of normality," where the
scapegoated "monsters" are marginalised and some stability is assured
provided the paranoid machines continue to function in the background,
with their counter-cathexes]{.underline}. However, ambiguities should
not to be passed over too lightly. The so-called differentiations within
civilised culture, from the exorcised, excluded, violated position of
the scapegoat, are clearly stigmatised differences; differences that
threaten the civilised repressive edifice. [The apparent peace and
stability of the civilised culture depends on these
exclusions.]{.underline} In other words, the differentiating and thus
civilising process is a violent process. [Whereas the anti-Oedipal
utopian vision is inclusive: the promiscuous and multiple "becomings"
are multiply differentiated singularities, molecularities, apparently
without any exceptions, antagonisms or rejected scapegoats.]{.underline}

[Žižek believes that the genius of Deleuze resides in his
"transcendental empiricism," where the impersonal machinic flow of pure
becoming teems infinitely more richly than the dullness of perceived
being.]{.underline} The genius of the real philosopher is that his
thinking enlivens ordinary reality. You can see the stratifications and
segmentations of political opinion that resist any
deterritorialisations: people remain in their defensive molar
aggregations, locking in intensities, repelling with their paranoid
machines. [You can trace the molecular developments of youthful enquiry,
the lines of flight, the singularities, before they are bounced off the
solid wall of language and reabsorbed into the existing sediments. You
can sense the spinning in the black hole of the empty BwO of the addict.
Deleuze "sees" the quantum level before the collapse of wave forms. He
imagines the infinite possibilities of fluid open multiplicities, before
they precipitate out as concrete actualities.]{.underline} [Deleuze's
ultimate reference, following Nietzsche, is "pure becoming," against the
dull opacity of Being. The assertion of continuous movement, flight,
break-flows, escapes, fluxes, etc., is the pure hidden potential of the
virtual, not to be misunderstood as the "before" and "after" of any
historicism, but pure becoming]{.underline} [-- no stratigraphy or
evolution, no development or progress, no context, no reference to real
events.]{.underline} Deleuze was the key interpreter of Nietzsche in
France. [Nietzsche pointed out that nothing important is ever free from
a "nonhistorical cloud." This leads to the paradox that something really
new can only emerge via repetition out of the cloud, the repetition of
the past "failure" to realise itself properly.]{.underline} Žižek cites
Walter Benjamin's example of the October Revolution's repetition of the
French Revolution, "redeeming" the latter's alleged failure. [What is
repeated is the transcendental-non-historical-]{.underline}cloud that
was betrayed, missed, not fully realised at the time. The Spirit
(Becoming) has been betrayed by the Letter (Being). It is tempting to
add that schizoanalysis, as the true Spirit of human freedom, has been
betrayed by the (repressive) Letter of psychoanalysis. Schizoanalysis
might redeem the failure of psychoanalysis: the "betrayal" by the later
Freud of the originality of the early Freud. Schizoanalysis is more
(early) Freudian, closer to the Freudian spirit, than all the subsequent
Freudians -- more Freud than Freud himself! Stick to the Letter and you
betray the Spirit -- always becoming --
fluid-multiplemolecular-singular. Schizoanalysis is the truly new
version of psychoanalysis, redeeming its potential vitality, its failure
to aspire to full liberation. This is the lesson to be learnt from our
authors. Against the thrust of the previous chapter, Žižek asserts that,
'[What Deleuze calls "desiring machines" concerns something wholly
different from the mechanical'.]{.underline}1 Against dull machinic
repetition of the same, what emerges is the miraculous new, on the lines
of Chesterton's Christian ontology.2 For instance, there is nothing
"mechanical" in the sun's rising every morning; on the contrary, it
reveals the miracle of God's creativity! Therefore, [our negative
assertion, that "machinic" refers to an inhuman banality, emphasising
not the miraculously new but quite the reverse, the totally
repetitive -- the emerging post-human, the ticking atomic clock, should
not be conceded here but held in suspense.]{.underline}3
[While]{.underline} the schizo[\[schizoanalysis\] may celebrate this
miraculous "becoming machine" of everything,]{.underline} the
neurotic[\[psychoanalysis\] fears the increasing reductionism and
automation of human experience, the translation of the most sublime
experiences into pure "functioning" and the inherent violence of such
thinking.]{.underline} The more human capacities are handed over to
prosthetics, the more we emerge as de-substantialised (parasitic)
subjects controlled by the machanosphere and artificial intelligence.4
The proximity of miraculating machines can terrify. [After he had
settled, a man described his ordeal on the main thoroughfare of the
capital city. He had had a sudden real-isation. Reality had decomposed.
He heard the grinding mechanics, gears, bearings, pistons, explosions in
the engines of passing lorries and buses without any mediation or
imaginary filter, as in a nightmare, and he had collapsed in
shock.]{.underline} A woman described the horror she felt when she saw
the bony skeletal articulations of people and the skulls like an X-ray
machine. Anorexics can describe in minute detail the machinations of
food in their digestive machines. A man says he will only sleep in a
room that contains hundreds of ticking alarm clocks all timed to go off
at the same hour. Another says, all I can tell you is that we are fluid
luminous beings made of contracting and relaxing fibres. Another man
says, 'I am a block of ice'. [In this, he has all the frozen smoothness
of a BwO.]{.underline} The schizos and [our authors "see" machinic
assemblages everywhere and these monstrosities approach the
Real]{.underline} in the Lacanian sense, or Hegel's "Objective Spirit."
[Žižek points to a crack in the edifice of the simple opposition between
molar and molecular, between being and becoming, the Symbolic and the
Real. These opposed registers are not equal and opposite.
Representation]{.underline} (Symbolic) [cannot be opposed to
production]{.underline} (Real). [With Deleuze, 'The virtual field is
(re)interpreted as that of generative, productive forces, opposed to the
space of representations'. And for Žižek, the proper site of production
cannot be the virtual space as such, which is the "empty" Lacanian Real,
but, rather, the passage from it to constituted representational
reality.]{.underline} [Žižek therefore questions the duality of
Deleuzian thinking -- becoming versus being; the nomadic versus the
State; the molecular versus the molar; the schizo versus the
paranoiac.]{.underline} He concludes, ['This duality is ultimately
over-determined as "the Good versus the Bad"']{.underline}.5 [To pursue
Žižek's ontological "crack," the first step is to question this simple
duality with similar duality,]{.underline} that of Badiou's Being and
Event[, emphasising their ultimate incompatibility.]{.underline}
[Event(s) cannot be simply mapped onto the field of becoming which
generates the order of being. Event(s) are only be posited
retrospectively. Only later can we "believe" that this was indeed "an
Event," standing out from the multitude -- an Event to which to remain
politically faithful in a militant way, as opposed to the ephemeral
indiscriminate spontaneous way of the "anarcho-désirants."]{.underline}
Žižek suggests that [our authors are doing no more than re-heating the
old humanist-ideal: regressing from the "reified" and reduced result in
the world, to its abundant productive becoming. It is the old story of
vitalism, the elevation of life to a new "becoming."]{.underline}
Whereas, Žižek believes that Badiou's "mathematics" is the only adequate
ontology: 'the meaningless Real of the pure multitude, the vast infinite
coldness of the Void'; i.e. the indifference of truth to the chaotic
flow of the world. While Deleuze asserts life in its multiple
singularities, for Badiou there is only the Hegelian from 'nothing to
nothing'.6 Žižek creates another reversal. [Against the notion of BwO
and its high-intensity prolonged pleasure/joy, the pure body of immanent
desire, he pits "organs without a body" (OwB).]{.underline} The latter
might be, for instance, the lonely masochist staging his sterile rituals
for futile pleasure -- maybe one of those failed, empty or cancerous
BwOs. Žižek complains that **[Anti-Oedipus is the worst book Deleuze
ever wrote,]{.underline}** citing the political ideological "bad
influence" of Guattari. He concludes that [our authors, despite
protestations to the contrary, end up as 'the ideologist\[s\] of late
capitalism'.]{.underline} For Éric Alliez, however, Deleuze and Badiou
typify the polarity of French philosophy. For Badiou[, Deleuze's work
and politics lacks coherent theoretical autonomy, being imbued with
Romantic mystical pretensions.]{.underline} Badiou sees mercantile
possibilities in communities demanding their singular recognitions --
women, gays, transsexuals, ethnic groups, etc., although clearly not
what our authors had in mind with their revolutionary explosive field of
immanence. As Alliez says, [The BwO is to be considered as the very body
of desire, as its purest expression, so absolutely coincident inseparate
from what it can do that it relates back to an unliveable power, a power
which is as such the pre-condition of every real experience of desire,
driven by the necessity of \[machinic\] constructions that cut
\[striate\] the BwO in itself']{.underline}.7 Thus, [Anti-Oedipus
confronts structuralism head-on by establishing beyond any doubt the
biopolitical primacy of desire. In other words, the deterritorialising
lines of flight, etc., come first and are therefore not reactive to
established biopolitical structures. The schizo is not a revolutionary
subject]{.underline} (or indeed a "subject" at all), [but merely the
site of interruption, mutation, rupture, the potential for revolution,
schizzing effects -- undercutting state, party and even utopian
communitarian projects. Inevitably, desire becomes exile, the
unconscious is orphan.]{.underline} What Alliez concludes is that we
should not oppose the Badiou--Žižek--Lacanian--structuralist axis with a
shallow post-structural, 'making room for a spontaneous democracy of
desire and its pop-philosophical flights of fancy', but oppose it much
more vibrantly, 'with [a Biopolitics of Multitudes]{.underline} whose
socially constitutive character is the ontological fact that [sustains
the constructivism of desire']{.underline}.8

#### The attempt to mobilize subjects on the basis of knowledge eschews enjoyment as the basis for action.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 172-176)//JRD

[For emancipatory politics, the transformation of knowledge from a
vehicle of liberation to an instrument of power has had devastating
effects. Emancipatory politics has traditionally relied on knowledge in
order to facilitate political change, and even today one of the primary
operations of emancipatory politics is getting information out to
citizens.]{.underline} In the minds of most people engaged in the
project of emancipation, the fundamental task has been establishing
class consciousness among the members of the working class. Class
consciousness, according to this way of thinking, is the basis for
substantive political change. As Georg Lukács puts it in History and
Class Consciousness, "The fate of a class depends on its ability to
elucidate and solve the problems with which history confronts it."12
[Political change depends]{.underline}, for someone like Lukács, [on the
knowledge that makes decisive action possible]{.underline}. [As long as
authority remains in the position of the traditional master, knowledge
can have a revolutionary function]{.underline}. [Historically, the
primary problem for emancipatory politics involved access to
education]{.underline}, which is why a key component of the communist
program that Marx and Engels outline in The Communist Manifesto is
universal access to public education. [There are those on the side of
emancipation who continue to insist that knowledge will be the source
for political change. According to this position, people side with
conservative policies against their own self-interest because they lack
the proper information.]{.underline} [They are the victims of
propaganda, and emancipatory politics must respond by providing the
missing knowledge. If not for big media's control over knowledge, the
thinking goes, subjects would cease to act against their self-interest
and would begin to oppose contemporary capitalism in an active
way.]{.underline} [**For those who adopt this position, political
activity consists in acts of informing, raising consciousness, and
bringing issues to light.** But today the failures of
consciousness-raising are evident everywhere.]{.underline} Such failures
are the subject of Thomas Frank's acclaimed analysis, What's the Matter
with Kansas? Frank highlights the proclivity of people in areas of the
United States like Kansas to act politically in ways that sabotage their
economic interests. He notes: "People getting their fundamental
interests wrong is what American political life is all about."13 [The
Right's current success in the United States and around the world is not
the sign that more people have become convinced that right-wing policies
will benefit them. Instead, conservatism permits people a way of
organizing their enjoyment in a way that today's emancipatory politics
does not. Emancipatory politics may offer a truer vision of the world,
but the Right offers a superior way of enjoying.]{.underline}
Traditionally, the primary advantage that emancipatory politics had in
political struggle was its challenge to authority. When one took up the
cause of emancipation, one took a stand against an entrenched regime of
power and experienced enjoyment in this defiance. One can still see this
form of enjoyment evinced in the revolutions of the Arab Spring in 2011.
Though emancipatory activity always entailed a certain risk (even of
death, to which the fate of innumerable revolutionaries attests), it
nonetheless brought with it an enjoyment not found in everyday obedience
and symbolic identity. In short, [there was historically a strong
libidinal component to emancipatory militancy that the risk it carried
amplified rather than diminished]{.underline}. [The liberating power of
emancipatory activity is present in]{.underline} almost every political
film. We see [activists falling in love as they jointly embark on an
emancipatory project or romance burgeoning as a fight for justice
intensifies]{.underline}. This dynamic, attesting to the enjoyment
inherent in militancy against the oppressive ruling order, manifests
itself in Warren Beatty's Reds (1981), Ken Loach's Bread and Roses
(2000), and Gillian Armstrong's Charlotte Gray (2001), to name just a
few of the many. In each case, the romance seems to spring out of the
risk that militancy against an oppressive regime entails. The love that
develops between Maya (Pilar Padilla) and Sam (Adrien Brody) in Bread
and Roses sparks first at the moment when Maya helps Sam to elude
corporate security agents at the office building where he is trying to
help unionize the janitors. Maya risks losing her job as a janitor when
she aids Sam, and this risk acts as the driving force for the eroticism
between them. [Conservatism has not traditionally provided much
enjoyment of this type, but it has had its own appeal. It took the side
of authority and stability. Whereas emancipatory politics could offer
the enjoyment that comes from defiance of authority, conservatism could
offer the enjoyment that comes from identification with it.]{.underline}
This is the enjoyment that one feels when hearing one's national anthem
or saluting the flag. It resides in the fabric of the nation's military
uniform that makes the fingers touching it tingle. This eroticism is not
that of emancipatory politics --- and it is perhaps not as powerful ---
but it is nonetheless a form of eroticism. [It produces a libidinal
charge.]{.underline} The struggle between conservatism and emancipatory
politics has historically been a struggle between two competing modes of
organizing enjoyment with neither side having a monopoly. [Despite the
traditional emphasis that the forces of emancipation placed on
knowledge, even in the past the struggle between emancipatory politics
and conservatism centered on enjoyment rather than knowledge. In the
political arena, knowledge is important only insofar as it relates to
the way that subjects mobilize their enjoyment. If subjects see through
ideological manipulation and have the proper knowledge, this does not
necessarily inaugurate a political change.]{.underline} [The knowledge
that something is bad for us]{.underline} --- a president or a Twinkie
--- **[does not lessen the enjoyment that we receive from it. It is not
that we have the ability to enjoy while disavowing our knowledge but
more that the knowledge works to serve our enjoyment.]{.underline}** The
enjoyment of a Twinkie does not derive from the physiological effect of
sugar on the human metabolism but from the knowledge of the damage this
substance does to the body. [Knowing the harm that accompanies something
actually facilitates our enjoyment of it, especially when we are capable
of disavowing this knowledge. Enjoyment is distinct from bodily
pleasures]{.underline} (which the Twinkie undoubtedly also provides);
[it depends on some degree of sacrifice that allows the subject to
suffer its enjoyment. Sacrifice is essential to our capacity for
enjoying ourselves. There is a fundamentally masochistic structure to
enjoyment.]{.underline}14 [It always comes in the form of an alien force
that overcomes us from the outside.]{.underline} As Alenka Zupančič puts
it, "It is not simply the mode of enjoyment of the neighbour, of the
other, that is strange to me. The heart of the problem is that I
experience my own enjoyment (which emerges along with the enjoyment of
the other, and is even indissociable from it) as strange and hostile."15
An initial experience of loss gives birth to the lost object around
which we structure our enjoyment, and our subsequent enjoyment demands a
return to the experience of loss. Through sacrifice and loss, we
reconstitute the privileged object that exists only as an absence. This
is why actually obtaining the privileged object necessarily disappoints:
when the lost object becomes present, it loses its privileged status and
becomes an ordinary empirical object. [Knowledge thus helps us to enjoy
not in the way that we might think --- that is, by showing us what is
good for our well-being --- but by giving us something to
sacrifice]{.underline}: if we know, for instance, that cigarettes are
unhealthy and could kill us, this elevates the mundane fact of smoking
into an act laced with enjoyment.16 With each puff, we repeat the act of
sacrifice and return to the primordial experience of loss. [The death
that we bring on is not simply the price that we pay]{.underline} for
smoking; it is the means through which we enjoy the act of smoking. In
this sense, every cigarette is really killing the smoker. If it didn't,
the act would lose its ability to provide enjoyment (though it may still
produce bodily pleasure).17 Under the rule of the traditional master,
prohibition sustains the possibility for this type of enjoyment: we can
enjoy an act because it transgresses a societal prohibition. As Lacan
notes in Seminar VII, "Transgression in the direction of jouissance only
takes place if it is supported by the oppositional principle, by the
forms of the Law. If the paths to jouissance have something in them that
dies out, that tends to make them impassable, prohibition, if I may say
so, becomes its all-terrain vehicle."18 Prohibition makes our enjoyment
possible by offering us the possibility for sacrifice. We sacrifice the
good and violate the prohibition. But prohibition no longer plays this
role in contemporary society. [No universal prohibition bars certain
activities; instead, knowledge about the harm that activities cause
begins to play the role that prohibition once played.]{.underline} We
don't avoid smoking simply because it is wrong but because we know the
harm that it causes. We don't refrain from extramarital sex because it
is wrong but because we know the societal and physical dangers it
entails. [Even conservatives think and talk this way.]{.underline} When,
for instance, conservatives argue for excluding information about
condoms from sex education classrooms, they claim that we know condoms
aren't 100 percent safe in preventing the spread of hiv[. In each case,
the authority is knowledge, not law. The libidinal charge in politics
involved with challenging the master has largely disappeared today, and
now that libidinal charge has attached itself to challenging the
experts, who represent the new agents of authority.]{.underline}

#### Our alternative asks the question of "what remains after the death of Oedipus?" In opposition to their will to positivity, we forefront the negative, the lack, irreducible void at the heart of subjectivity.

[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}, [to be (in)credible must keep faith with
the traumatic kernel of the Real -- negative thinking.]{.underline}
Insofar as therapy supports repression with its recovery programmes, our
husband will try to focus on the fact that he did arrive home too early,
or, even if he didn't, and whatever his wife was doing, he should work
on his issues -- to do with jealousy, dependency and so on. Mindfulness
would help him relax. [The whole drama of psychoanalysis struggles
against these false notions of recovery, growth and comfort which are
legion, to find instead the "basic fault,"]{.underline}63 [where the
story breaks, or the mask slips, the lip quivers and the cracks
appear.]{.underline} [The analyst struggles against all the various
"fixes" that tempt the sufferer]{.underline}, from CBT programmes to
drug therapies, [all of which]{.underline} have their uses, but [have to
do with "doing" and "utility" rather than with "being" as such; to do
with "moving on" rather than "being still," to do with continuous
re-invention and re-branding, the "new me," and so on, rather than
reflection.]{.underline} In this Heideggerian sense, therapies are
indeed 'forgetful of Being', individual being and the larger Being.
[Following the machinic anti-Oedipal logic, treatments for mental
suffering resemble hit-and-run crashes, where drivers leave the scene of
the accident never to return.]{.underline} 'My father was depressed; his
brain was malfunctioning; he just needed a drug to fix it'. Return to
the devastated surface. Is he okay now? Yes. Well fine! Within a very
short time, the road is cleared, the traffic is flowing again. A few
bits of glass remain. [How can an analyst ever be an authority again
without the Oedipal compass that should orient everything
analytic?]{.underline} Who is willing to believe that, for instance, a
hyperactive child, let us take a hypothetical but not uncommon instance,
is continually trying to evacuate from his mind/body, unbearable and
unthinkable anxiety generated by his distressed mother, deserted by the
boy's father, living in a part of town that is disadvantaged, now on her
own and unable to cope herself? The child seeks a "container," his
school, or the classroom to hold him together, but he continually
destroys it as he repeats and "communicates" his psychotic distress
about his (idealised and unreachable) mother who bore him and now cannot
love him. No! He has a damaged brain, neuro-imaging shows it, and he
must take his Ritalin. Who is willing to investigate by listening to the
narrative of the life of a middle aged woman who presents with, for her
and her family, an unaccountable depression after her father died, which
has continued too long. Medication is indicated. She believed that out
of her four siblings she was secretly her father's favourite, enjoying
really special times with him especially when her mother got sick. In
adult life, she became his unofficial secretary and confidante and would
even accompany him to functions as his career progressed. She got
married, had children, but her imaginary father still held a special
place in her heart. When he got sick and died suddenly just a few years
back, she was distraught. But when his will was read, she was left with
practically nothing. [Who, without analytic insight and experience, can
really appreciate the intense rage and hurt at the "betrayal" by her
father and the self punishment and self-hate]{.underline} (depression)
[that ensue as she identifies with his rejection and abandonment, first
by dying and second at the level of his final desire/will? The analyst
with an Oedipal compass understands the primitive oral omnipotence
involved in anorexia, the master-slave fight to death with the
re-discovered disappointing mother, over food -- the ravaging greed
coming from the id and the cannabalistic superego that that reduces her
body to a skeleton that looks as if it might win the battle of will and
counter-will in the war for total control and total perfection of the
emaciated body.]{.underline} And the father was forced out to be a
helpless bystander. [Everyone has a story to tell, but the analyst needs
investigative powers, the skill and the desire to get beyond the story's
manifest content -- the very limited story -- to the real scandals of
Oedipal dynamics.]{.underline} Who understands and accepts as real, for
instance, the intense emotions elaborated by Melanie Klein --
matricidal, infanticidal, the insane mute limits of the human? And who
in these non-judgemental days is prepared to find hidden sadism and
masochism? Even analysts under supervision regularly miss human
deviousness, complicity, deceit, double-dealing, and so on. They refuse
in toto the real range of human dialectic, preferring instead the
sentiments around a "damaged self," or now a "damaged brain," with
minimal responsibility. We believe what people say, but must also
disbelieve, because revelation and resistance alternate. Resistance is
always present. Only the gullible will just listen and believe, but this
now passes for the highest therapeutic understanding and respect. To
disbelieve is disrespectful and insulting unless you are a negative
thinker. Winnicott spoke of the true and false self. If we give it a
Levinasian gloss, conatus essendi is the false self. The striving to
maintain being, the false self qua caretaker self, or ego, begs the
question of the status of the true self. Does it exist? Winnicott's
answer is that it "exists" to a degree in secret,64 until it finds a
facilitating environment (in life, in analysis?) in which to express its
emergent spontaneity, aliveness and real feeling, or in Lacanian terms,
until it can speak. An analyst unaware of this distinction may allow
years of analysis to continue unproductively -- 'The patient's false
self can collaborate indefinitely'.65 The existential twist creates a
necessary edge, not there with Winnicott. The delight with Winnicott was
always his sense of ease and playfulness. However, analysis is bound to
interrogate the false self, as it can become not so much a caretaker,
but a minder, at worst a paranoid mindbody guard, protecting the subject
from suffering, from the other within and without. With the loss of the
"facilitating environment" over the half-century since this paper was
written, the minder false self increasingly threatens to usurp the whole
scene, guaranteeing security at the expense of life. Disturb this minder
false self (via analysis) and he is likely to retaliate with terroristic
threats against the subject and the analyst. What happens, observes
Winnicott, is 'a need to collect impingements from external reality so
that the living-time of the individual can be filled by reaction to
these impingements'.66 Thus, an analysis risks taking on the minders but
with no certain outcome! [Rather than resolving the Oedipus complex, the
anti-Oedipal "solution" is likely to end up becoming bogged down within
it, or remaining pre-Oedipal. But who can detect this without the
Oedipus compass?]{.underline} Like the young man with no history and no
dreams, who lives from minute to minute, not thinking but reacting. His
mother calls him many times a day as she worries about him. He lets her.
She does his washing and sometimes she "feeds" him. He works a little
but spends time helping out his sisters with their children. He says,
'they are always there for him'. There is never a mention of his father.
[Who without an Oedipal orientation can identify the "plague," the story
spoken of around the forbidden/enjoyable/disappointing incestuous
bonds?]{.underline} A young woman was given medication to cope with the
ongoing stress caused by her parent's acrimonious divorce 10 years
previously. Her father left and remarried. She had no self-confidence in
spite of significant success in her career. Her therapist gave her
positive exercises to increase confidence but to no avail. Analysis
revealed her secret Oedipal wish that her fighting parents would
separate, countered by an equally strong reparative wish that they would
stay together. When they really did divorce, her guilt was intense. She
had caused it. She tried to excel at work to ward off her "badness."
When her father re-married, his "betrayal" was complete, stirring up
more jealous hatred and punitive self-condemnation. [Only by proper
analysis of Oedipal desire, confronting head-on the negative drives, is
it possible to rebuild, repair, but not recover. The subject remains
divided. People used to fear their demons, derived from negative
thinking and wishes associated with the Oedipus complex. Now, after
anti-Oedipus there is shallowness. With positive thinking, not just some
things are phoney, but everything may be phoney! Semblants everywhere
forcing their dissembling reality on you like an insomniac roar to drown
out the void.]{.underline} [The closer the void, the louder the roar,
which bespeaks the ultimate failure, the ultimate cynicism of positive
thinking. The pendulum has swung so far in this direction that all
moderation has been lost.]{.underline} Heidegger reminds us that for the
Greeks, truth is something stolen from concealment. For Heraclitus, the
prevailing of things has in itself a striving to conceal. The risk of
analysis is underlined by American satirist H. L. Mencken: 'for every
nugget of truth, some wretch lies dead on the scrapheap'. [The conceit
of positive thinking is that it can definitely improve on the prevailing
of things, whereas analysis, in creating a space for the saying of what
is concealed, risks the radical contestation of "prevailing of things."
The criticism of modern "analysis" is that it does not contest. It
listens well but does not analyse.]{.underline} [Analysis per se belongs
to a master discourse and must cease its search for truth. Listen but
don't analyse; the end of analysis.]{.underline} Freud's instruction to
the analyst was 'to put aside all his feelings, even his human sympathy,
and concentrate his mental forces on the single aim of performing the
operation \[analysis\] as skilfully as possible'. Freud concludes his
remarks by reference to the French surgeon, Ambroise Paré: 'I dressed
his wounds, God cured him'.67 At first reading, this is the best
refutation of the comforting therapeutic you could imagine -- analysis
not therapy. [This instruction should be read in conjunction with the
aforementioned assertion by Freud that 'analysis is a cure through love'
-- clearing a space free of sympathy, pity, etc., yet dressing his
wounds, and finally, the unknown -- God's cure -- through love. But who
ever thinks of God?]{.underline}

#### We must forefront the analytic of the drive. Only analysis which begins from the question of enjoyment and the abandonment of the good as a model of desire can ever hope to transform political terrains.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 283-286)//JRD

[There is no path leading from the death drive to utopia. the death
drive undermines every attempt to construct a utopia; it is the enemy of
the good society.]{.underline} It is thus not surprising that political
thought from Plato onward has largely ignored this psychic force of
repetition and negation. [But this does not mean that psychoanalytic
thought concerning the death drive has only a negative value for
political theorizing.]{.underline} [It is possible to conceive of a
positive politics of the death drive.]{.underline} [The previous
chapters have attempted to lay out the political implications of the
death drive, and, on this basis, we can sketch what a society founded on
a recognition of the death drive might look like.]{.underline} [Such a
recognition would not involve a radical transformation of society: in
one sense, it would leave everything as it is. In contemporary social
arrangements, the death drive subverts progress with repetition and
leads to the widespread sacrifice of self-interest for the enjoyment of
the sacrifice itself.]{.underline} [This structure is impervious to
change and to all attempts at amelioration. But in another sense, the
recognition of the death drive would change everything. Recognizing the
centrality of the death drive would not eliminate the proclivity to
sacrifice for the sake of enjoyment, but it would change our
relationship to this sacrifice.]{.underline} [Rather than being done for
the sake of an ultimate enjoyment to be achieved in the future, it would
be done for its own sake.]{.underline} The fundamental problem with the
effort to escape the death drive and pursue the good is that it leaves
us unable to locate where our enjoyment lies. [By positing a future
where we will attain the ultimate enjoyment]{.underline} (either through
the purchase of the perfect commodity or through a transcendent romantic
union or through the attainment of some heavenly paradise), [we replace
the partial enjoyment of the death drive with the image of a complete
enjoyment to come. There is no question of fully enjoying our submission
to the death drive. We will always remain alienated from our mode of
enjoying.]{.underline} As Adrian Johnston rightly points out,
"Transgressively 'overcoming' the impediments of the drives doesn't
enable one to simply enjoy enjoyment."1 [But we can transform our
relationship to the impediments that block the full realization of our
drive. We can see the impediments as the internal product of the death
drive rather than as an external limit.]{.underline} [The enjoyment that
the death drive provides, in contrast to the form of enjoyment proffered
by capitalism]{.underline}, religion, and utopian politics, [is at once
infinite and limited.]{.underline} This oxymoronic form of enjoyment
operates in the way that the concept does in Hegel's Logic. [The concept
attains its infinitude not through endless progress toward a point that
always remains beyond and out of reach but through including the beyond
as a beyond within itself.]{.underline} As Hegel puts it, "The
universality of the concept is the achieved beyond, whereas that bad
infinity remains afflicted with a beyond which is unattainable but
remains a mere progression to infinity."2 That is to say, the concept
transforms an external limit into an internal one and thereby becomes
both infinite and limited. The infinitude of the concept is nothing but
the concept's own self-limitation. [The enjoyment that the death drive
produces also achieves its infinitude through self-limitation. It
revolves around a lost object that exists only insofar as it is lost,
and it relates to this object as the vehicle for the infinite unfurling
of its movement. The lost object operates as the self-limitation of the
death drive through which the drive produces an infinite enjoyment.
Rather than acting as a mark of the drive's finitude, the limitation
that the lost object introduces provides access to infinity. A society
founded on a recognition of the death drive would be one that viewed its
limitations as the source of its infinite enjoyment rather than an
obstacle to that enjoyment.]{.underline} To take the clearest and most
traumatic example in recent history, the recognition of the death drive
in 1930s Germany would have conceived the figure of the Jew not as the
barrier to the ultimate enjoyment that must therefore be eliminated but
as the internal limit through which German society attained its
enjoyment. As numerous theorists have said, the appeal of Nazism lay in
its ability to mobilize the enjoyment of the average German through
pointing out a threat to that enjoyment. the average German under Nazism
could enjoy the figure of the Jew as it appeared in the form of an
obstacle, but it is possible to recognize the obstacle not as an
external limit but as an internal one. In this way, the figure of the
Jew would become merely a figure for the average German rather than a
position embodied by actual Jews. Closer to home, one would recognize
the terrorist as a figure representing the internal limit of global
capitalist society. Far from serving as an obstacle to the ultimate
enjoyment in that society, the terrorist provides a barrier where none
otherwise exists and thereby serves as the vehicle through which
capitalist society attains its enjoyment. [The absence of explicit
limitations within contemporary global capitalism necessitates such a
figure: if terrorists did not exist, global capitalist society would
have to invent them.]{.underline} [But recognizing the terrorist as the
internal limit of global capitalist society would mean the end of
terrorism.]{.underline} This recognition would transform the global
landscape and deprive would-be terrorists of the libidinal space within
which to act. Though some people may continue to blow up buildings, they
would cease to be terrorists in the way that we now understand the term.
[A self-limiting society would still have real battles to
fight.]{.underline} There would remain a need for this society to defend
itself against external threats and against the cruelty of the natural
universe. Perhaps it would require nuclear weapons in space to defend
against comets or meteors that would threaten to wipe out human life on
the planet. But [it would cease positing the ultimate enjoyment in
vanquishing an external threat or surpassing a natural limit. The
external limit would no longer stand in for a repressed internal one.
Such a society would instead enjoy its own internal limitations and
merely address external limits as they came up.]{.underline}
[Psychoanalytic theory never preaches, and it cannot help us to
construct a better society. But it can help us to subtract the illusion
of the good from our own society. By depriving us of this illusion, it
has the ability to transform our thinking about politics.]{.underline}
With the assistance of psychoanalytic thought, we might reconceive
politics in a direction completely opposed to that articulated by
Aristotle, to which I alluded in the introduction. In the Politics,
Aristotle asserts: "Every state is a community of some kind, and every
community is established with a view to some good; for everyone always
acts in order to obtain that which they think good. But, if all
communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is
the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a
greater degree than any other, and at the highest good."3 Though later
political thinkers have obviously departed from Aristotle concerning the
question of the content of the good society, few have thought of
politics in terms opposed to the good. This is what psychoanalytic
thought introduces. [If we act on the basis of enjoyment rather than the
good, this does not mean that we can simply construct a society that
privileges enjoyment in an overt way.]{.underline} An open society with
no restrictions on sexual activity, drug use, food consumption, or play
in general would not be a more enjoyable one than our own. That is the
sure path to impoverishing our ability to enjoy, as the aftermath of the
1960s has made painfully clear. [One must arrive at enjoyment
indirectly. A society centered around the death drive would not be a
better society, nor would it entail less suffering. Rather than
continually sacrificing for the sake of the good, we would sacrifice the
good for the sake of enjoyment. A society centered around the death
drive would allow us to recognize that we enjoy the lost object only
insofar as it remains lost.]{.underline}

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 26-28)//JRD

With psychoanalysis now overwhelmed by therapy culture, our authors'
attack was farseeing. A lachrymose philosophy around victimhood, the
allegedly traumatic nature of ordinary life, the "fragile child," the
"loving" mother, the regressive infantilisation of language, and so on,
have become commonplace since Anti-Oedipus. However, has schizoanalysis
fostered this regression, while aggressively asserting the opposite? The
"flowers" were told that they had no power against the fascist System.
They were traumatised by excess! No wonder the mass of ordinary working
people at the time failed to understand and sympathise with their
hysterical protesting! [The paranoid logic machine deployed through
books, TV, lectures, sit- ins, workshops, etc., convinced and seduced
many into believing that the "military industrial complex of the West"
was at work everywhere; the silent masses were complicit, as fascistic
as the war-planners in Washington or Moscow]{.underline}. [They were
told and believed that they had been alienated, colonised, violated and
conditioned into fascistic "normality;" and with this ideology the
engine of narcissism and hurt was set going demanding a whole
therapeutic culture to put things right.]{.underline}21 They were tuning
in and dropping out like flies. The baby- boomers had the biggest
tantrum in history. Born into an unprecedented age of prosperity after
WW2, protected by the welfare state, educated beyond what any former
generation could ever have hoped for, pampered with consumer goods, and
they are the ones to complain! They felt guilty about war, about
violence (televised from anywhere in the world for the first time in
real- time), about wealth, about living. [They succumbed to
ressentiment, as activated anti- Oedipal force or desire is turned
around against itself, 'pushed back and repressed, incarcerated within
and finally able to discharge and vent itself only on
itself']{.underline} (Nietzsche cited: 234). Baudrillard referred to
this self-hatred or backlash as the last stage in the liberation of the
species, a paradoxical turning around against the self at the advanced
stage of rationality and civilisation. 'There is no need to posit a
death drive at work, a biological nostalgia for a state prior to
individuation and sex',22 just a reflexive mortification as we glimpse
the degree to which the soul has lost its grandeur. Two
post-psychoanalytic strands took shape during the past half century.
First, the non-erotic infantile logic based in hurt and trauma; second,
the "nonhuman erotic" spirited on by neo-Reichians and anti- Oedipeans
with their desiring machines and molecular rhizomal energies. Both
strands claim a psychoanalytic heritage; both have polemicised an aspect
of Freud to the detriment of his whole opus. And now it is probably too
late to rescue that whole thing. Sloterdijk noted that psychoanalysis
lacked thymos and thymotic potential, what he called a "bank of rage."
Instead of mobilising prideful rage, honour and ambition, we
domesticated rage, turning it into hurt, while becoming preoccupied with
sex as an end in itself. In short, we went crazy about both love and
humility, creating 'subcultures in which beautiful souls sent one
another messages of love'.23 [The interruption of pride for the sake of
a libidinal politics entirely suits contemporary capitalist consumerism,
buying off the dignity of human beings with gadgets as
concessions.]{.underline} [Pride, dignity and honour are not part of the
psychoanalytic lexicon.]{.underline} [Instead they have become
pathologised by 'the thymos-forgetting therapeutic culture
...]{.underline} in the tradition of Christian moralists'.24 [The rage
generated in the pages of Anti- Oedipus against familial domestication
in all its forms is a great burst of freedom, a mass break-out and
escape- release of great thymotic potential]{.underline}. [Why in
practice does it fall back to earth in narcissistic ruins, a failed
project easily reterritorialised by the capitalist machine?]{.underline}
In the last chapter of Rage and Time, called "The Dispersal of Rage in
the Era of the Centre," Sloterdijk points to this diffusion of desire
where '[every individual is turned into a consumption
citizen]{.underline}, who unless uplifted by family, cultural and
cooperative counter- forces, [is increasingly fixed to a poisoned
loneliness with a doomed irritation of desire']{.underline}.25 [Desire
per se, destined for total liberation by anti- Oedipeans, forever free
and untrammelled, becomes just an irritation.]{.underline} Enzenberger,
seeming to echo [Anti- Oedipus, refers to "molecular civil wars." 'The
reality is that civil war has long since moved into the
metropolis']{.underline}. As Enzensberger26 says, 'The beginning is
bloodless, the evidence circumstantial. [Molecular civil war starts
unnoticed; there is no general mobilization'. Rubbish accumulates,
syringes and broken bottles appear in the park, graffiti is daubed on
the walls. In schools and colleges, classroom furniture is
smashed.]{.underline} These are 'muted declarations of war which any
experienced city- dweller can interpret'. [Then, tyres are slashed, cars
set on fire. In one incident after another, rage is vented, hate turns
on anything that works, and forms an insoluble amalgam with self-
hate'.]{.underline} He concludes, 'its only message \[is\] one of
autism'.27 [Not dispersal of rage, but a free-floating random affair, a
lone-gunman syndrome -- molecular, atomistic, homicidal-
suicidal.]{.underline} [The desiring machines exact their revenge for
their wholesale failure to break through and break out by turning
themselves into rage machines.]{.underline} Add self- radicalisation
here as Islamism is a ready conduit for rage. [The flowers are turned
into weeds, dominated not by Oedipus and daddy, but by mommy alone, or
indeed by no one at all. Be orphan. Be nomad. Be free. Go viral: 'Make
rhizomes, not roots, never plant! Don't sow, grow offshoots! Don't be
one, be multiple, be multiplicities!']{.underline}28 [Free -- to be
bereaved, homeless, rootless, aimless "singularities" with "enjoyments,"
left absolutely alone with 'the unconscious that produces itself in a
cyclical orphan movement']{.underline} (319). [The wreck of
psychoanalysis is to be found at these two extremes: at the weedy end
with mommy, safe but fragile; or with mommy and daddy slaughtered long
ago as part of the libidinised, schizo killing machines -- 'knowing
nothing of persons ... nothing of the ego']{.underline} (392) -- [in
total indifference creating a level killing field and a race to the
bottom- anus- shit.]{.underline} [If you take schizoanalysis seriously
you seem bound to end as a speck on a pseudopodium of the
erotic]{.underline} (Foucault), [or a green- fly parasite consumer
sucking on the erotic juices of Capitalism.]{.underline} No effective
thymotic, no bank of rage, no balls, just generalised neurasthenia and
stress. [Every bridge back]{.underline} (to civilisation) [has been
burned by the scorched earth deterritorialisations of capitalism and
schizoanalysis, with no way of deciding about these mass "enjoyments,"
daring not even to venture a judgement.]{.underline} Sloterdijk shares
our disillusion with a reference to Lacan. 'In its pretension to co-form
a revolutionary subject, politicised psychoanalysis failed miserably'.
So, as a half-way house to revolution, 'the new purists \[Lacanians\]
mark themselves off from everything to do with sense-giving,
interpretation, construction, life-projects, because this would once
again put into play the need to explain people normatively, to develop
positive ideas of culture \[civilisation\], and introduce creative
processes'.29 [By retaining notions such as castration, the Law, the
Symbolic, they are still part of the kill-joy processes, while
pretending to be otherwise. As our authors say, psychoanalysis spans a
mixed semiotic. On the one hand, 'a despotic regime of significance and
interpretation', and on the other, 'an authoritarian regime of
subjectification and prophetism'. Between the fetishised authority of
the unconscious and the aura of the silent analyst: '\[T\]he worst, most
underhanded of powers are founded on it']{.underline} (138). For its
part, however, romanticised schizoanalysis has been influential. Like
Zarathustra, these romantics know incredible sufferings and sicknesses.
Fifty or more years on are they still remarkable? 'They must reinvent
each gesture. But such a man produces himself as a free man,
irresponsible, solitary and joyous, finally able to say and do something
in his own name, without asking permission; a desire lacking nothing
...' (142).

### Deleuze Stuff v PEss

#### We offer an ethics of affirmation: a joyous politics of transforming negative affects into ones that affirm life. Ethics is the dictum that we will never cease affirming multiplicity, relational connections, and the emergence of the New. To affirm becoming is to recognize the joyful potential for everything to be weaponized, subverted, and rendered active.

"Affirmation versus Vulnerability: On Contemporary Ethical Debates"
*Symposium: Canadian Journal of Continental Philosophy*, vol. 10, no. 1,
Spring / Printemps 2006, pp 235-254/

[The [ethics of affirmation]{.mark}, with its emphasis on moving across
the pain and transforming it into activity]{.underline}, [may [seem
counter-intuitive.]{.mark} In our culture [people go to]{.mark} great
[lengths to ease]{.mark} all pain, but especially the [pain of
uncertainty]{.mark} about identity, origin, and belonging.]{.underline}
[Great [distress follows]{.mark} from [not knowing]{.mark}]{.underline}
or not being able to articulate [the source of one's suffering, [or from
knowing]{.mark} it [all too well]{.mark}]{.underline}, all the time.
[[People]{.mark} who have been [confronted by the]{.mark} irreparable,
the unbearable, the insurmountable, the traumatic and [inhuman event
will do anything to find]{.mark} solace]{.underline}, resolution,
[and]{.underline} also [[compensation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
[yearning for]{.mark} these measures]{.underline}--- [[solace, closure,
justice]{.underline}]{.mark}---is all too understandable and worthy of
respect. Nowadays, this longing [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} both supported
and [[commercially exploited]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by genetics
and]{.mark} its application to [tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} of
[[racial]{.underline}]{.mark} and territorial
[[origins.]{.underline}]{.mark} The ethical dilemma was already posed by
Jean-François Lyotard in Le Differend and, much earlier, by Primo Levi
about the survivors of Nazi concentration camps: [the kind of
vulnerability human beings experience [in face of events on the scale of
high horror]{.mark} is something for which no adequate compensation is
even thinkable, let alone applicable]{.underline}. [[There is an
incommensurability of the suffering]{.mark} involved for which
[no]{.mark} measure of [compensation is possible---a]{.mark} hurt or
[wound beyond repair.]{.mark} This means that the notion of
[justice]{.mark} in the sense of a logic of [rights and reparation is
not applicable]{.mark} in a quantifiable manner]{.underline}. For
Lyotard, in keeping with the poststructuralist em phasis on the ethical
dimension on the problem, **[[ethics consists in accepting the
impossibility of adequate compensation, and living with the open
wound]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the contrary, [[contemporary culture
has taken the opposite direction:]{.mark} it has favored, encouraged,
and [rewarded]{.mark} a [public morality based on]{.mark} the twin
principles of [claims and compensation]{.mark}]{.underline}[**,** [as if
financial settlements could provide the answer to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [injury]{.mark} suffered, the [pain]{.mark} endured, [and]{.mark}
the long-lasting effects of the [injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cases
that exemplify this trend are the compensation]{.underline} for the
Shoah in the sense of restitution of stolen property, artworks, and bank
deposits. Similar [claims]{.underline} have been [made by the
descendants of slaves]{.underline} forcefully removed from Africa to
North America (Gilroy, 2000), and more recently compensation for damages
caused by Soviet communism, notably the confiscation of properties
across eastern Europe, from Jewish and other former citizens. [[The
ethics of affirmation is about suspending the quest for]{.mark} both
claims and [compensation, resisting the logic of retribution]{.mark} of
rights [and taking]{.mark} instead [a different
road]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to understand this move it is
important to de-psychologize the discussion of affirmation.
[[Affectivity]{.mark} is intrinsically understood as positive: it is the
force that [aims at fulfilling the subject's capacity for interaction
and freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is Spinoza's conatus, or
the notion of [potentia as [the affirmative aspect of power.]{.mark} It
[is joyful]{.mark} and pleasure-prone, and it is immanent]{.underline}
in that it coincides with the terms and modes of its expression. [This
means concretely that [ethical behavior]{.mark} confirms, facilitates,
and [enhances]{.mark} the subject's potentia, as [the capacity to
express]{.mark} his/her [freedom.]{.mark} The positivity of this [desire
to express]{.mark} one's innermost and constitutive freedom]{.underline}
(conatus, potentia, or [[becoming]{.underline}) [is conducive to ethical
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, only if the subject is capable
of making it endure, thus allowing it to sustain its own impetus.
[[Unethical behavior]{.mark} achieves the opposite: it denies, hinders,
and [diminishes that impetus]{.mark} or is unable to sustain it.
[Affirmation is]{.mark} therefore [not naive
optimism]{.mark}]{.underline} or Candide-like unrealism. [[It is about
endurance]{.mark} and transformation]{.underline}. [Endurance is
self-affirmation]{.underline}. It is also [an ethical principle of
affirmation of the positivity of the intensive subject---its joyful
affirmation as potentia]{.underline}. The subject is a spatio-temporal
compound which frames the boundaries of processes of becoming. [This
works by [transforming negative into positive]{.mark} passions through
the power of an understanding]{.underline} that is no longer indexed
upon a phallogocentric set of standards, but is rather [unhinged
and]{.underline} therefore [affective]{.underline}. [This sort of
[turning]{.mark} of [the tide of negativity is the transformative
process of achieving freedom]{.mark} of understanding [through the
awareness of our limits]{.mark}, of our bondage]{.underline}. [This
results in the freedom to affirm one's essence as joy, through
encounters and minglings with other bodies, entities, beings, and
forces. [Ethics means faithfulness to]{.mark} this potentia, or [the
desire to become]{.mark}]{.underline}. Deleuze defines the latter with
reference to Bergson's concept of "duration," thus proposing the notion
of the subject as an entity that lasts, that endures sustainable changes
and transformation and enacts them around him/herself in a community or
collectivity[. Affirmative ethics rests on the idea of sustainability as
a principle of containment and tolerable development of a subject's
resources, understood environmentally, affectively, and cognitively. A
subject thus constituted inhabits a time that is the active tense of
continuous "becoming]{.underline}." Endurance has therefore a temporal
dimension: it has to do with lasting in time---hence duration and
self-perpetuation. But it also has a spatial side to do with the space
of the body as an enfleshed field of actualization of passions or
forces. [It evolves affectivity **and [joy, as in the capacity for being
affected]{.mark} by these forces, [to the point of pain or]{.mark}
extreme [pleasure]{.mark}, which come to the same; it [means putting up
with hardship]{.mark} and physical pain**]{.underline}. The point,
however, is that extreme pleasure or extreme pain---which may score the
same on a Spinozist scale of ethology of affects---are of course not the
same. On the reactive side of the equation, endurance points to the
struggle to sustain the pain without being annihilated by it. It also
introduces a temporal dimension about duration in time. This is linked
to memory: intense pain, a wrong, a betrayal, a wound are hard to
forget. The traumatic impact of painful events fixes them in a rigid,
eternal present tense out of which it is difficult to emerge. This is
the eternal return of that which precisely cannot be endured and returns
in the mode of the unwanted, the untimely, the un-assimilated or
in-appropriate/ d. They are also, however, paradoxically difficult to
remember, insofar as re-membering entails re trieval and repetition of
the pain itself. Psychoanalysis, of course, has been here before
(Laplanche, 1976). The notion of the return of the repressed is the key
to the logic of unconscious remembrance, but it is a secret and somewhat
invisible key which condenses space into the spasm of the symptom and
time into a short-circuit that mines the very thinkability of the
present. Kristeva's notion of the abject (1980) expresses clearly the
temporality involved in psychoanalysis---by stressing the structural
function played by the negative, the incomprehensible, the unthinkable,
the other of understandable knowledge. Deleuze calls this alterity
"Chaos" and defines it ontologically as the virtual formation of all
possible form. Lacan, on the other hand---and Derrida with him, I would
argue---defines Chaos epistemologically as that which precedes form,
structure, and language. This makes for two radically divergent
conceptions of time and negativity. That which is incomprehensible for
Lacan, following Hegel, is the virtual for Deleuze, following Spinoza,
Bergson, and Leibnitz. This produces a number of significant shifts:
from negative to affirmative; from entropic to generative; from
incomprehensible, meaningless, and crazy to virtual waiting to be
actualized; from constituting constitutive outsides to a geometry of
affects that require mutual synchronization; from a melancholy and split
to an open-ended web-like subject; from the epistemological to the
ontological turn in poststructuralist philosophy. [This introduces a
temporal dimension into the discussion that leads to the very conditions
of possibility of the future, to futurity as such. For an ethics of
sustainability, the expression of positive affects is that which makes
the subject last or endure. It is like a source of long-term energy at
the affective core of subjectivity]{.underline} (Grosz, 2004). Nietzsche
has also been here before, of course. The eternal return in Nietzsche is
the repetition, yet neither in the compulsive mode of neurosis nor in
the negative erasure that m arks the traumatic event. It is [the eternal
return of and as positivity]{.underline} (Ansell-Pearson, 1999). [This
kind of ethics addresses the affective structure of pain and suffering
but does not locate the ethical instance within it, be it in the mode of
compassionate witnessing]{.underline} (Bauman 1993; 1998) [or empathic
co-presence]{.underline}. [In a nomadic]{.underline}, Deleuzian-
Nietzschean [perspective, ethics is essentially about transformation of
negative into positive passions]{.underline}, that is, [about moving
beyond the pain. This does not mean denying the pain but rather
activating it, working it through]{.underline}. Again, [the positivity
here is not supposed to indicate a facile optimism or a careless
dismissal of human suffering. What is positive in the ethics of
affirmation is the belief that negative affects can be
transformed]{.underline}. [This implies a dynamic view of all affects,
even those that freeze us in pain, horror, or mourning. [Affirmative
nomadic ethics puts the motion back into e-motion and the active back
into activism]{.mark}, introducing movement, process, and
becoming.]{.underline} This shift makes all the difference to the
patterns of repetition of negative emotions. [[What is negative about
negative affects is not a value judgment]{.underline}]{.mark} (any more
than it is for the positivity of difference), [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
rather [the effect of arrest, [blockage, and rigidification]{.mark} that
comes as a result of an act of violence, betrayal, a
trauma]{.underline}---or which can be self-perpetuated through practices
that our culture simultaneously chastises as self-destructive and
cultivates as a mode of discipline and punishment: all forms of mild and
extreme addictions, differing degrees of abusive practices that mortify
and glorify the bodily matter, from binging to bodily modifications.
Abusive, addictive, or destructive practices do not merely destroy the
self but harm the self's capacity to relate to others, both human and
non-human others. Thus they [harm the capacity to grow in and through
others and become others. Negative passions diminish]{.underline} our
capacity to express the high levels of interdependence[, the vital
reliance on others,]{.underline} [which is the key to a non-unitary and
dynamic vision of the subject]{.underline}. [What is [negated by
negative passions is the power of life itself, as]{.mark} the dynamic
force, [vital flows of]{.mark} connections and
[becomings]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This is why they should not be
encouraged, nor]{.underline}]{.mark} [should we be [rewarded for
lingering around]{.mark}]{.underline} [[them]{.underline}]{.mark} too
long. [Negative passions are black holes. [An ethics of affirmation
involves the transformation of]{.mark} negative into positive passions:
[resentment into affirmation]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Nietzsche put it.
The practice of transforming negative into positive passions is the
process of [reintroducing]{.underline} time, [movement, and
transformation into a stifling enclosure saturated with]{.underline}
unprocessed [pain]{.underline}. [It is a gesture of affirmation of hope
in the sense of affirming the possibility of [moving beyond the]{.mark}
stultifying effects of the pain, [the injury]{.mark}, the
injustice]{.underline}. This is [a gesture of [displacement of the hurt,
which]{.mark} fully [contradicts]{.mark} the twin logic of claims and
[compensation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is [achieved through
a]{.underline} sort of [[de-personalization of the event,]{.mark} which
is [the ultimate ethical challenge.]{.mark} The [displacement of the
ego-indexed]{.mark} negative]{.underline} passions or [[affects]{.mark}
reveals the fundamental senselessness of the hurt, the injustice, or
injury one has suffered]{.underline}. "[Why me?"]{.underline} is the
refrain most commonly heard in situations of extreme distress. This
expresses rage as well as anguish at one's ill fate. [The answer is
plain: for no reason at all]{.underline}. Examples of this are the
banality of e vil in large-scale genocides like the Holocaust
(Arendt,1963), and the randomness of surviving them (think of Primo Levi
who could/not endure his own survival). [There is something
intrinsically senseless about the pain or injustice: lives are lost or
saved for all and no reason at all.]{.underline} Why did some go to work
in the WTC on 9/11 while others missed the train? Why did Frida Kahlo
take that tram which crashed so that she was impaled by a metal rod, and
not the next one? For no reason at all. [Reason has nothing to do with
it]{.underline}**.** [That is precisely the point. Contrary to the
traditional morality that follows a rationalist and legalistic model of
possible interpretation of the wrongs one suffered to a logic of
responsibility, claim, and compensation, affirmative ethics rests on the
notion of the random access to the phenomena that cause
pain]{.underline} (or pleasure). [[This is not fatalism, and even less
resignation, but rather amor fati.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is a
crucial difference: [we have to be worthy of what happens to us and
rework it within an ethics of relation]{.underline}. Of course,
repugnant and [unbearable events do happen]{.underline}. [[Ethics
consists]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[in reworking]{.mark} these
[events in]{.mark} the direction of [positive
relations.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This is not]{.mark} carelessness or
lack of compassion, [but]{.mark} rather [a form of]{.mark} lucidity that
[acknowledges the impossibility of]{.mark} finding [an adequate answer
to the question about the]{.mark} source, the origin, the [cause
of]{.mark} the ill fate, [the painful event,]{.mark} the violence
suffered]{.underline}. [Acknowledging the futility of even trying to
answer that question is a starting point]{.underline}. Edouard
[Glissant]{.underline} (1991) [provides a perfect example of this
productive ethics in his work on race and racism]{.underline}. [An
ethical relation cannot be based on resentment or resignation, but
rather on the affirmation of positivity]{.underline}. [Every event
contains within it the potential for being overcome and overtaken; its
negative charge can be transposed.]{.underline} The moment of the
actualization is also the moment of its neutralization. ["Every event is
like death, double and impersonal in its double,]{.underline}" argues
Deleuze (1990, 152). [[The free subject, the ethical subject is the one
with the ability to grasp the freedom to depersonalize the event and
transform its negative charge.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The
focus]{.underline} thus [shifts to asking the adequate
questions]{.underline}. [Adequateness]{.underline}, both the logic of
claim and compensation, [lies at the heart of the ethical
stance.]{.underline} [This requires a double shift: of the pain
itself]{.underline}---[from the frozen or reactive effect to proactive
affirmation---and of the line of questioning---from the quest for the
origin or source to a process of elaboration of the kind of questions
that express and enhance a subject's capacity to achieve freedom through
the understanding of its limitations]{.underline}. What is [an adequate
ethical question]{.underline}? One that i[s capable of sustaining the
subject in his/her quest for more interrelations with
others]{.underline}, that is, [more Life, motion, change,
transformation, and potentia]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} adequate
ethical [question provides the subject with a frame for interaction and
change, growth and movement]{.underline}. [It affirms life as
difference-at-work]{.underline}. An ethical question had to be adequate
in relation to how much a body can take, which is the notion of
sustainability. How much can an embodied entity take in the mode of
interrelations and connections, that is, how much freedom of action can
we endure? That is the question. It assumes, following Nietzsche, that
[humanity does not stem from freedom, but rather that freedom is
extracted out of the awareness of limitations.]{.underline} [[Ethics
is]{.mark} about [freedom from]{.mark} the weight of
[negativity,]{.mark} freedom [through]{.mark} the [understanding]{.mark}
of [our bondage.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[A certain amount of
pain]{.mark}, the knowledge about vulnerability and pain, [is actually
useful. It forces one to think about the actual material conditions of
being interconnected]{.mark}** []{.mark}and thus being in the
world]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[It frees one from the stupidity of
perfect health, and the full-blown sense of existential
entitlement]{.mark} that comes with it]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [it
is those who have already cracked up a bit, those who have suffered pain
and injury, who are better placed to take the lead in the process of
ethical transformation]{.underline}. Because [they are already on the
other side of some existential divide]{.underline}, they are anomalous
in some way ---but in a positive way, for Deleuze (1969, 1988). [Their
anomaly deterritorializes the force of habit and introduces a powerful
element of productive difference]{.underline}. They know about
endurance, adequate forces, and the importance of Relations. Marxist
epistemology and feminist standpoint theory have always acknowledged the
privileged knowing position of those in the "margins." Postcolonial
theory displaces the dialectics of center-margin and locates the force
of discursive production. [Affirmative ethics is on the same wavelength:
only [those who have been hurt are in a position not to return the
violence]{.mark} and hence make a positive difference. In order to do
so]{.underline}, however, [they have [to
become-minoritarian]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, [[transcend the logic
of negativity]{.underline}]{.mark} ([claim and compensation) [and
transform the negative affect into something active and
productive.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The center being dead and empty of
active force, it is on the margins that the processes of becoming can be
initiated.]{.underline} It is also crowded on the margins. The figure of
Nelson [Mandela]{.underline}---a contemporary secular saint---[comes to
mind]{.underline}, [as does the]{.underline} world-historical phenomenon
that is the [T]{.underline}ruth and [R]{.underline}econciliation
[C]{.underline}ommission in post-apartheid South Africa. This is [a case
of repetition that engenders difference and does not install the eternal
return of revenge and negative affects, a massive exercise in
transformation of negativity into something more livable, more
life-enhancing]{.underline}. Christianity has tried to be here before.
It has had an important input in the work of Cornell West, bell hooks,
and other spiritually-m inded activists today, especially in
reconstituting a sense of community and mutual responsibility in places
devastated by hatred and mutual suspicion. [Affirmative nomadic
ethics]{.underline} is profoundly secular and it [refuses simply to turn
the other cheek. It proclaims the need to construct collectively
positions of active, positive interconnections and relations that can
sustain a web of mutual dependence, an ecology of multiple
belongings.]{.underline} It is [a case of extracting freedom from the
awareness of limits]{.underline}. [For the affirmative ethics of
sustainability, [it is always already a question of life and
death]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** Being on the edge of too-muchness, or of
unsustainability, [surfing on the borders of the intolerable is another
way of describing the process of becoming]{.underline}.
[Becoming]{.underline} marks a qualitative leap in the transformation of
subjectivity and of its constitutive affects. It is a trip across
different fields of perception, different spatio-temporal coordinates.
Mostly it [transforms negativity into affirmative affects: pain into
compassion, loss into a sense of bonding, isolation into
care]{.underline}. It is [simultaneously a slowing down of
the]{.underline} rhythm of [daily frenzy and an acceleration of
awareness, connection to others, self-knowledge and sensorial
perception]{.underline}. [Ethics includes the acknowledgment of and
compassion for pain, as well as the activity of working through
it]{.underline}. [Any process of change must do some sort of violence to
deeply engrained habits]{.underline} and dispositions which got
consolidated in time. [Overcoming these engrained habits is a necessary
disruption, without which there is no ethical awakening]{.underline}.
Consciousness- raising is not free of pain. The utterance: "I can't take
it anymore!" far from being an admission of defeat, marks the threshold
and hence the condition of possibility for creative encounters and
productive changes. This is how the ethical dimension appears through
the mass of fragments and shreds of discarded habits that are
characteristic of our times. [[The ethical project is not the same
as]{.mark} the implementation of ruling standards of [morality.]{.mark}
It rather concerns the norms and values, the standards and criteria that
can be applied to the quest for sustainable, that is to say for newly
negotiated limits]{.underline}. [Limits are to be rethought in terms of
an ethics of becoming]{.underline}, through a non-Hegelian notion of
"limits" as thresholds, that is to say [points of encounter and not of
closure, living boundaries and not fixed walls. The joint necessity for
both the pursuit of social change and in-depth transformation, as well
as for an ethics of endurance and sustainability, is important to stress
because critical and creative thinkers and activists who pursue change
have often experienced the limits or the boundaries like open wounds or
scars.]{.underline} The generation that came of age politically in the
seventies has taken enormous risks and has enjoyed the challenges they
entailed. A lot was demanded and expected from life and most ended up
getting it, but it was not only a joy ride. [An ethical evaluation of
the costs involved in pursuing alternative visions, norms, and values is
important in the present context where the alleged "end of ideology" is
used as a pretext for neoliberal restoration that terminates all social
experiments]{.underline}. [It is necessary to find a way to combine
transformative politics with affirmative ethics so as to confront the
conceptual and social contradictions of our times. Sustainable
affirmative ethics allows us to contain the risks while pursuing the
original project of transformation.]{.underline} [[This is a way to
resist the dominant ethos of]{.mark} our conservative times [that
idolizes the new as a consumerist trend while thundering against those
who believe in change]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Cultivating the ethics of
living intensely in the pursuit of change **is a political
act.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Venerating injuries as the starting point for activism traps identity in the shame of the past impotence in face of those wounds, which re-inscribes powerlessness. It becomes locked in a cycle of revenge, constructing hostile external threats to blame as a symptom-treatment to ressentiment

**[[Enter politicized identity]{.mark}, now [conceivable]{.mark} in part
as both product of and \"reaction\" to this condition, where
\"reaction\" acquires the meaning that Nietzsche ascribed to it, namely,
[as an effect of domination that reiterates impotence, a
substitute]{.mark} for action, for power, [for self-affirmation that
reinscribes]{.mark} incapacity, [powerlessness]{.mark}, and rejection.
For Nietzsche, [ressentiment]{.mark} itself [is rooted in
\"reaction]{.mark}\"-the substitution of reasons, norms, and ethics for
deeds-and not only moral systems but identities themselves take their
bearings in this reaction]{.underline}**. As Tracy Strong reads this
element of Nietzsche\'s thought, **[[Identity]{.mark} \... [does not
consist of an active component, but is a reaction to something
outside]{.mark}; action in itself, with its inevitable self-assertive
qualities, must then become something evil, since it is identified with
that against which one is reacting. [The will to power of slave morality
must constantly reassert that which gives definition to the slave: the
pain he suffers by being in the world. Hence any attempt to
escape]{.mark} that pain [will merely]{.mark} result in the
[reaffirm]{.mark}ation of painful [structures. If ressentiment\'s
\"cause\" is suffering, its \"creative deed\" is]{.mark} the reworking
of this pain into a negative form of action, [the \"imaginary revenge\"
of]{.mark} what Nietzsche terms [\"natures denied the true reaction,
that of deeds.\" This]{.mark} revenge [is achieved through the
imposition of suffering \"on whatever does not feel]{.mark} wrath and
[displeasure as he does]{.mark}\"23 ([accomplished]{.mark} especially
[through the production of guilt), through the establishment of
suffering as the measure of social virtue, and]{.mark} through
[casting]{.mark} strength and good fortune (\"[privilege]{.mark}\" as we
say today) [as]{.mark} self-recriminating, as [its own indictment in a
culture of suffering: \"it is disgraceful to be fortunate, there is too
much misery.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** But in its attempt to displace its
suffering, identity structured by ressenti- ment at the same time
becomes invested in its own subjection. This invest- ment lies not only
in its discovery of a site of blame for its hurt will, not only in its
acquisition of recognition through its history of subjection (a recogni-
tion predicated on injury, now righteously revalued), but also in the
satisfac- tions of revenge that ceaselessly reenact even as they
redistribute the injuries of marginalization and subordination in a
liberal discursive order that alter- nately denies the very possibility
of these things or blames those who experience them for their own
condition. **[Identity politics structured by ressentiment reverses
without subverting this blaming structure: it does not subject to
critique the sovereign subject of accountability that liberal indi-
vidualism presupposes nor the economy of inclusion and exclusion that
liberal universalism establishes. Thus [politicized identity]{.mark}
that presents itself as a self-affirmation now appears as the opposite,
as predicated on and [requir]{.mark}ing [its sustained rejection by a
\"hostile extemal world.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**25 Insofar as what
Nietzsche calls slave morality produces identity in reac- tion to power,
insofar as identity rooted in this reaction achieves its moral
superiority by reproaching power and action themselves as evil, identity
structured by this ethos becomes deeply invested in its own impotence,
even while it seeks to assuage the pain of its powerlessness through its
vengeful moralizing, through its wide distribution of suffering, through
its reproach of power as such. [**[Politicized identity, premised on
exclusion and fueled by the]{.mark} humiliation and [suffering imposed
by its]{.mark} historically structured [impotence]{.mark} in the context
of a discourse of sovereign individuals, is as likely to [seek
generalized political paralysis]{.mark}, to feast on generalized
political impo- tence, [as it]{.mark} is to [seek]{.mark} its own or
collective [liberation]{.mark}. Indeed it is more likely to punish and
reproach[-\"punishment is what revenge calls itself; with a hypocritical
lie it creates a good conscience for itself\'-than to find]{.mark}
venues of [self-affirming action]{.mark}.26 [But contemporary
politicized identity\'s desire is not only shaped by the]{.mark} extent
to which [the sovereign will of the liberal subject,]{.mark} articulated
ever more nakedly by disciplinary individuation and capitalist
disinternments, is dom- inated by late twentieth-century configurations
of political and economic powers**. **[It is shaped as well by]{.mark}
the contemporary problematic of history itself, by [the late modern
rupture of history as a narrative]{.mark}, history as ended because it
has lost its end, a rupture that paradoxically produces an immeasurable
heaviness to history. As the grim experience of reading Discipline and
Punish makes clear, there is a sense in which the gravitational force of
history is multiplied at precisely the moment that history\'s narrative
coherence and objectivist foundation is refuted**]{.underline}. As the
problematic of power in history is resituated from subject positioning
to subject formation, power is seen to operate spatially,
infiltrationally, \"microphysically\" rather than only tempo- rally; it
is also seen to permeate and construct every heretofore designated
\"interior\" space in social orders and in subjects. As the erosion of
historical metanarratives takes with them both laws of history and the
futurity such laws purported to assure, the presumed continuity of
history is replaced with a sense of its violent, contingent, and
ubiquitousforce. History becomes that which has weight but no
trajectory, mass but no coherence, force but no direction; it is war
without ends or end. Thus the extent to which \"dead generations weigh
like a nightmare on the brains of the living\" is today unparalleled
even as history itself disintegrates as coherent category or practice.
We know ourselves to be saturated by history, we feel the extraor-
dinary force of its determinations; we are also steeped in a discourse
of its insignificance, and above all, we know that history will no
longer (always already did not) act as our redeemer. **[I raise the
question of history because in thinking about late modem politicized
identity\'s structuring by ressentiment, I have thus far focused on its
foundation in the sufferings of a subordinated sovereign subject. But
Nietzsche\'s account of the logic of [ressentiment is]{.mark} also
tethered to that feature of the will that is [stricken by
history]{.mark}, that rails against time itself, that [cannot \"will
backwards,\"]{.mark} that cannot exert its power over the past-either as
a specific set of events or as time itself:]{.underline}** Willing
liberates but what is it that puts even the liberator himself in
fetters? \'It was\'-that is the name of the will\'s gnashing of teeth
and most secret melancholy. **[[Powerless against what has been done, he
is an angry spectator of all that is past]{.mark}\.... He cannot break
time and time\'s covetousness, that is the will\'s loneliest
melancholy.27 Although Nietzsche appears here to be speaking of the will
as such, Zarathustra\'s own relationship to the will as a \"redeemer of
history\" makes clear that [this \"angry spectatorship\" can]{.mark}
with great difficulty [be reworked as]{.mark} a perverse kind of
mastery, [a mastery that triumphs over the past]{.mark} by reducing its
power, by remaking the present against the terms of the past-in short,
[by a project of self-transformation that arrays itself against its own
genealogical consciousness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In contrast with the
human ruin he sees everywhere around him-\"fragments and limbs and
dreadful accidents\"-it is Zarathustra\'s own capacity to discern and to
make a future that spares him from a rancorous sensibility, from
crushing disappointment in the liberatory promise of his will: [**[The
now and the past]{.mark} on earth-alas, my friends, that [is what I find
most unendurable; and I should not know how to live if I were not also a
seer of]{.mark} that which much come.** **A seer, a willer, a creator,
[a future]{.mark} himself and a bridge to the future-and alas, also as
it were, a cripple at this bridge: all this is Zarathustra.28
[Nietzsche]{.mark} here [discerns both the necessity and]{.mark} the
near impossibility-[the]{.mark} extraordinary and fragile
[achievement-of formulating oneself as a creator of the future]{.mark}
and a bridge to the future in order [to appease the]{.mark} otherwise
inevitable [rancor of the will against time, in order to redeem the past
by lifting the weight of it]{.mark}, by reducing the scope of its
determinations. \"**]{.underline}And how could I bear to be a man if man
were not also a creator and guesser of riddles and redeemer of
accidents?\"29 **[Of course, Zarathustra\'s exceptionality in what he is
willing to confront and bear, in his capacities [to overcome in order to
create]{.mark}, is Nietzsche\'s device for [reveal]{.mark}ing [us to
ourselves.]{.mark} The ordinary will, steeped in the economy of [slave
morality, devises means \"to]{.mark} get rid of his melancholy and to
mock his dungeon\" that [reiterate the cause of]{.mark} the [melancholy,
that continually reinfect the narcissistic wound]{.mark} to its
capaciousness [inflicted by the past.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \"Alas,\"
says Nietzsche, \"every prisoner becomes a fool; and the imprisoned will

#### The alt affirms the Black aleatory body as a rhizomatic line of flight whose existence exceeds and precedes any formal ontological structure. Blackness is a "rhizome" -- a [flowing]{.underline} and [creative]{.underline} force which [overflows]{.underline} [structuralist]{.underline} accounts of antagonism. We must [decenter]{.underline} the frame of [political ontology]{.underline} to enable resistance grounded in micropolitical [pragmatics]{.underline}.

**Kline '17** (David Kline, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of
Religion at Rice University, "The Pragmatics of Resistance: Framing
Anti-Blackness and the Limits of Political Ontology," *Critical
Philosophy of Race*, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2017, pg. 63 - 66, *Emory Debate*)

[Chandler is describing the way [Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}---in all
of its social scope and complexity---[**[overflows]{.mark}** or breaks
open the boundaries of [any formal imposition]{.mark}, the way Blackness
cannot be reduced to a frame of abjection [or]{.mark} the
[irreconcilable]{.mark} position of an [antagonism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
From this perspective, [[Blackness is a **rhizome**, a]{.mark} dynamic,
[**creative**, and **desiring** counter-force]{.mark} in which [**lines
of flight** present]{.mark} possible [modes of freedom]{.mark} and
sociality in excess to political ontological positioning.]{.underline}
As a paraontological phenomenon, Chandler and Moten understand Blackness
as a unique and specific exertion within modernity---which might also be
called the historical regime of racial political ontology---that
challenges every schema of formalization and \[End Page 63\] positional
fixity. [In this way, from this vantage, [the history of Blackness is
read as a]{.mark} history of a certain performativity of the [drive
towards a freedom not determined by the terms]{.mark} or boundaries [of
ontology]{.mark}, as a history of the object's absolute objection to the
macropolitical capture of identity.]{.underline} This paraontological
movement of Black fugitivity, as Moten has coined it, calls into
question the framing of Blackness wholly within a political ontology
that seeks to index and describe Black life in terms of pure abjection.

Again, Moten and Chandler do not in any way downplay the abjection to
which Blackness is given in the modern world. Indeed, Moten considers
his project and that of Afro-pessimism as two sides of a mutual project
where "Black optimism and Afro-pessimism are asymptotic" (Moten 2014,
778). Yet, by insisting on the possibilities of Black life within an
immanent and micropolitical field of becoming that moves in resistance
to a rigid political ontology of social death, Moten taps into something
vital that precedes the force of imposition, the force of law, or the
force of the structure of White supremacy and its sedimented political
ontological order. In this way, he also expands the frame of analysis
and praxis so that a much wider field of resources and possibilities are
available in terms of a project of liberation that goes beyond the
political ontological frame.

[This is where I suggest [the **decentering** of political ontology
and]{.mark} the [inclusion of the **Black aleatory body**]{.mark} as the
site of struggle, evasion, and creation [becomes a]{.mark} pragmatic
mode of framing the problem and thinking a purely [practical politics
of]{.mark} both [**spontaneous creation** and]{.mark} a **[calculated
movement]{.mark}** against the political ontological regime of
anti-Blackness.]{.underline} Although Moten would certainly object to
describing this turn by way of a "pragmatic politics," I suggest that
his "Black optimism" and Chandler's paraontology find congruence with a
kind of Foucaultian-Deleuzian pragmatics which, as Paul Patton describes
Deleuze's philosophy, "\[enables\] a form of description which is
immediately practical" and an "ethico-political conception of philosophy
as oriented towards the possibility of change" (Patton 2003, 16, 17).
[From this angle, [the **accurate representation** of]{.mark} an
**[ontological reality]{.mark}**, while certainly necessary and crucial
to the task of naming the full scope of the problem and thinking a way
forward, [does not take precedence over]{.mark} the task of **[creating
new concepts]{.mark}** and lines of flight that [should be judged on
their effectiveness]{.mark} not in terms of properly representing an
ontological problem, but [in terms of]{.mark} their [concrete effects
within a **wide field of contexts**]{.mark}, specific socio-political
problems, and conjunctures.]{.underline} As Deleuze and Guattari
describe how pragmatics marks a study attuned to the complexity, \[End
Page 64\] contingency, and potential danger that defines the
micropolitical, ["the study of the dangers of each line is the object of
pragmatics or **[schizoanalysis]{.mark}**, to the extent that it
[undertakes not to represent]{.mark}, interpret, or symbolize, [but only
to **make maps** and **draw lines**]{.mark}, marking their mixtures as
well as their distinctions]{.underline}" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987,
227). [[Pragmatics]{.mark}, in this way, [is]{.mark} all [about drawing
lines]{.mark} and making maps against macropolitical sedimentations
[that lead somewhere, that **create something
new.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Such pragmatic orientation is especially pertinent in the contemporary
biopolitical frame as Foucault understands it. As I've already
described, Foucault's biopolitics is premised on the idea that when
politics takes the biological body as its primary aim and object, as
opposed to sovereign power's object of the legal subject and its
constitutive negative, then there is introduced into politics the
possibility, as Cary Wolfe notes, "for life to burst through power's
systematic operations in ways that are more and more difficult to
anticipate" (Wolfe 2014, 158). [[The **increasing complexity** of bodily
knowledge]{.mark} and the power that takes this knowledge as its
operating principle [means that both **risk** and **possibility**
increase in]{.mark} terms of [what the body can do and what can be done
to the body]{.mark}.]{.underline} The pragmatic thrust of this emerges
when situating it at the level of micropolitics, where, as I've been
describing, Deleuze and Guattari locate the conditions for lines of
flight and where "there is always something that flows or flees, that
escapes the binary organizations, the resonance apparatus, and the
overcoding machine" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 216). [Out of any
sedimentation there will always be deterritorialization and
reterritorialization. [The pragmatic possibility]{.mark} or potential,
then, [is that there is always a simultaneity of]{.mark} the
[micropolitical and]{.mark} the [macropolitical]{.mark} that provides
the conditions [for an ongoing search for **new** **tactics**]{.mark},
orientations, assemblages, vocabularies, [and **processes of
becoming**]{.mark} that are [aimed practically towards
change]{.mark}]{.underline}: "What matters is to break through the wall,
even if one has to become-black like John Brown. George Jackson. **[['I
may take flight, but all the while I am fleeing, I will be looking for a
weapon!"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Deleuze and Guattari 2009, 277). This
emphasis on pragmatics and lines of flight---both in potentially
negative and positive terms (i.e. in terms of pure
contingency)---provides a much more expansive level for framing the
problem of anti-Blackness that is not reducible to fixed political
ontological positions and the macropolitical plane.

Finally, I suggest this kind of pragmatics is what Moten and Harney
describe as "fugitive planning and Black study," what Jack Halberstam
\[End Page 65\] characterizes simply as "reaching out to find
connection" (Moten and Harney 2013, 5). [[Pragmatics finds]{.mark} a
[footing in the]{.mark} highly dynamic and [shifting terrain of power
relations]{.mark} and its multiplicity of conjunctures [that signal the
condition of movement]{.mark} and connection.]{.underline} It finds its
enactment in sites such as "the little Negro's church and logos and
gathering, this gathering in and against the word, alongside and through
the word and the world as hold, manger, wilderness, tomb, upper room,
and cell" (Moten 2014, 775). [[Within these]{.mark} and other
[sites]{.mark} of micropolitical connection and the practices that take
place in them, [there is flight]{.mark}, resistance, [and]{.mark} the
[creation of something new and productive.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The
**inclusion** of these sites]{.mark} and practices [within the
analytical frame]{.mark} and critique [of anti-Blackness provide]{.mark}
a much wider set of [resources for thinking the complexity of]{.mark}
the full scope of [the political field]{.mark} that exists in excess to
the political ontological frame]{.underline}, and, in the same way,
orients the fight against anti-Blackness in practical (though
potentially no less revolutionary), rather than apocalyptic, terms.
This, I argue, does not have to mitigate or pass over Sexton's call that
"slavery must be theorized maximally if its abolition is to reach the
proper level" (Sexton 2011, 33). The maximum theorization of slavery and
anti-Blackness does not need be completely hedged in by a political
ontological frame. However, analytical expansion beyond the political
ontological frame does mean locating a positive emphasis on what Sexton
disparagingly identifies as a tendency towards "forces of mitigation
that would transform the world through a coalition of a thousand tiny
causes" (ibid.). Taking Sexton's (and Wilderson's) call of a maximum
theorization of slavery/anti-Blackness with full seriousness, [[I wonder
what]{.mark} the proper level of [**abolition could possibly mean**
other than]{.mark} a pragmatic coalition---or [a **micropolitics**---of
a **thousand tiny causes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As I've argued,
thinking what this might mean would certainly necessitate an expansive
analytics of power relations flowing over a highly complex field of
forces, intensities, technologies, and dispositifs that together form a
micropolitical field far in excess of sovereign power and the political
ontological frame. Out of such an analytics, a pragmatics that finds its
possibility in the micropolitical field of movement and flight emerges
as the condition for an ongoing life of resistance, connection, and a
movement toward freedom. \[End Page 66\]

#### The idea of a completely pure rejection of the anti-black world both homogenizes experience and traps the figure of the Black as a fungible anchor for revolutionary impulse.

**Walsh 15** \[Shannon, "The Philosopher and His Poor: The Poor-Black as
Object for Political Desire in South Africa," *Politikon: South African
Journal of Political Studies*, Volume 42, Issue 1, 2015, June 17, 2015\]

Fantasy, optimism and the poor-Black as object

While Rancière claims that the poor as object creates possibility for
the philosopher, Frank Wilderson goes further. Wilderson (2010) argues
that the Human itself is forged through the denial of humanity to the
Black.5 [[Through situating the Black as anti-human]{.mark}, object and
voiceless, the Human is thus constitute]{.underline}d. In South Africa,
the Philosopher\'s poor is also, always, Black.

[For the academic Left]{.underline}, I would argue that [[there is a
**cruelly optimistic** attachment]{.mark} or relation [with a fungible
poor-Black]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This optimistic relation is bound up
with emancipatory]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and]{.underline} sometimes
[pseudo-revolutionary]{.underline}, [[desires for another]{.mark}
possible [world]{.mark}. This attachment or relation is **not limited to
South Africa**]{.underline}, [but very [often it is **Black
bodies**]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[or the bodies of indigenous
people]{.underline}**) **[who are [objectified for this]{.mark} kind of
[fantasy to play out]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The fundamental antagonism
is one in which the poor-Black is a **repository for the projected
desires** and longings of (white) revolutionary fantasy]{.underline}---a
[strange nostalgia of some **impossible vanquished time** that existed
in the **pure space of non-knowledge**]{.underline}.

Lauren [Berlant reminds us that your desire misrecognizes a given object
as that which will restore you to something that you sense effectively
as a hole in you. Your object, then, does not express transparently who
you 'are' but says something about what it takes for you to anchor
yourself in space and time.]{.underline} (2011, 110)

[This is a romance between the Human and the]{.underline} necessarily
non-Human, the [Other, **which is always fantasy**.]{.underline} [[The
poor-Black becomes object onto which **revolutionary desires can be
projected**]{.mark} and **fantasized**]{.underline}. [[For the
**revolutionary fantasy to hold**, they must remain]{.mark} in their
wretchedness, must **remain [as objects denied]{.mark} the [complex
existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the being Human---enjoyed by those
who hold the power of representation and fantasy construction. Of
course, the horrible irony of such a situation is that [while [the
poor-Black]{.mark} as an object of desire [might]{.mark} offer an
[anchor]{.mark} for [such]{.mark} 'fantasmic [investments']{.mark}
towards a better world for the Left, [in so doing **it**]{.mark}
**effectively [denies that world from ever
appearing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For **[how can such a world erupt from
such a depraved and violent denial of being]{.underline}**?

[[The fantasy]{.mark} of the fungible poor-Black [is a romance full of
**optimism**]{.mark} and aspirations, [as well as]{.mark} full of
**dangerous denials** and **[objectifications]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Ultimately it is also a romance like any other: [[full of]{.mark}
**false hopes**, **[good intentions]{.mark}** and **lots of
fantasy**]{.underline} (Bob 2005; Levenson 2012). [The implication of
**[leaving behind revolutionary subjectivities]{.mark}** as vestibules
for political optimism and hope is difficult, but it **[must be
done]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed [[a critique of]{.mark} the ways
[social movements]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the poor-Black, [have been
constructed, and at times desired, [in Left academia is crucial]{.mark},
and one that I hope will **open spaces for reimagining what solidarity
could look like**]{.underline}. This is no easy task. As Berlant (2013)
reflects,

[[All political movements]{.underline}]{.mark} ... [[are
**complicated**]{.mark} **spaces** where the courageous insistence on
interrupting the reproduction of toxic normativity is a relief from
resignation to life]{.underline}. But [**[every movement]{.mark} that
[we\'ve ever been in reproduces]{.mark} issues of [inequality]{.mark}**
around race, gender, sexuality and education, along with the inevitable
personality glitches. That also can be devastating.]{.underline}

[[Berlant encourages]{.mark} a **dose of [humour]{.mark}** [to **counter
the devastation**]{.mark}, [to **laugh at the**]{.mark} **foibles**,
[**missteps**]{.mark} and **false romances**]{.underline}. I sincerely
[hope that [the fantasy can be **abandoned**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that
[there can be a way forward that will include]{.mark} a **[transparent
reflection]{.mark}** on the nature and exercise of political power
within and around social movements]{.underline} in South Africa,
reflection that takes seriously race, gender and institutional power.

Discussion and Conclusion [This article developed a profile
of]{.underline} Atlantic Canadian [disability leaders in terms of tasks
performed and leadership styles]{.underline} in order to take stock of
the existing skill sets and to identify gaps in needed skills so as to
enhance services delivery in government-disability nonprofit
partnerships. It did so in relation to government disability program
officials and executive directors of disability organizations, the
latter of which included a scan of their boards of directors to assess
their impact. At a broad level, [we are seeing disability organizations
in a struggle to survive let alone thrive]{.underline} in a period of
increasing needs for disability services. For executive directors, the
emphasis was on contract implementation with fundraising and budgeting
issues closely behind. This placed a premium on skills used---people,
management, capacity and communication skills. In particular, people
skills such as the ability [to continually cultivate relationships
with]{.underline} key individuals such as sponsors and [**government
officials are critical** and is at the heart of needed management skills
such as fundraising]{.underline} and financial reporting skills.
[Relationship building is also key to organizational effectiveness given
the need to]{.underline} develop staff while [remain]{.underline}ing
[flexible and collaborative in orientation in order to meet a diverse
set of work objectives]{.underline} (the latter capacity skills).
Cultivating relationships required effective oral and written
communication skills, especially for grant writing. Far from a top down
model of management as is often found in the for-profit sector, we
found, in addition to an inclusive and collaborative model of management
down to staff and clients, a notable outward need be similarly inclusive
and collaborative in working with partner agencies and sponsors. The
above results differed slightly for government disability officials.
While the hierarchical top down model of management can be found in the
significant upward need to meet the need or "manage" superiors, a large
and [significant role exists]{.underline} of managing outwards [to
**engage other**]{.underline} departments and [**stakeholders** in order
**to win support** for their initiatives.]{.underline} Evidence of this
pressure can be found in the needed capacity skills: analysis and
synthesis and in having a good understanding of how government worked in
addition to key relationship and effective communication skills.
Executive directors have also been challenged in the move to a
competitive funding environment with many noting in interviews they
wished they had had more exposure to financial issues and management. We
also found executive directors challenged at times in working with their
board of directors. Significant time was required to manage them given
needed information and in filling gaps that remained to ensure the
organization moved along. The results suggest that [working
with]{.underline} boards of [directors was a "**necessary evil**" in
that one could not get around it given regulations]{.underline} for
nonprofit organizations, but the time devoted to such work necessarily
took away from what could be devoted to working with client groups,
staff and external stakeholders, especially for small to medium sized
disability organizations. The result is that [we are left with a
**patchwork quilt of disability services** as **persons with
disabilities have become customers in this neoliberal
period**]{.underline} able [to purchase needed services]{.underline}
from a number of disability organizations. However, as citizens in a
democratic society, this is troubling given people are not obtaining
adequate services either because they cannot afford to or because of
under provision of services thereby limiting their ability to equally
participate in society. [This is where a focus on disability rights
can]{.underline} help [balance the playing field. It was interesting to
see this point made by a government disability official]{.underline} (NS
3). [While this **may on the surface suggest a desire to minimize
disability services**]{.underline}, that is, to provide only what one is
legally entitled to provide in order to meet basic rights, [**this was
not the case**.]{.underline} Rather, as [the individual explained, the
challenge was in working across departmental silos and with other
units]{.underline} within their own department [in pursuing their
goals]{.underline}, and where the need existed to not think in terms of
costs. Instead, the question to be asked was one of "What's best for the
person in need of disability services?" and to then go from there. This
underscored the fact that governments were poorly structured to meet the
complex needs of persons with disabilities, at least until they begin
using a cross-departmental person-centred approach, something which
governments are poorly structured to do.

#### Priming of existential risk focuses on *[compassion]{.underline}* which results in progressivism 

**Vail et al, 9** (Kenneth E. Vail III, University of Missouri

Support for Barack Obama and John McCain in the 2008 Presidential
Election,\" Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, Vol. 9, No. 1,
p. 263-266, IC)

The present findings extend those of Rothschild et al. (2009).
**[Rothschild]{.underline}** et al. **[showed that [priming]{.mark}
religious [fundamentalists with compassionate
values]{.mark}]{.underline}** that were clearly tied to their religious
foundations in either Christianity or Islam **[[led to lower level of
support for the use of violence]{.mark} against Iran among Americans and
to less hostile attitudes toward the United States]{.underline}**
(including less support of martyrdom attacks) **[among Iranians; [in the
absence of priming]{.mark} these compassionate values, [death reminders
led to increased support for violence among both
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The present study goes beyond a religious
context to show that **[in the absence of being faced with compassionate
values, [death reminders increased support for]{.mark}]{.underline}**
John **[[McCain; but when oriented toward compassionate values, MS
increased support for Barack Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[This]{.underline}** study also **[provides convergent support for a
growing number of findings that [existential threat is capable of
motivating defense of progressive, prosocial values like tolerance,
egalitarianism, and empathy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Gailliot et al.,
2008; Greenberg et al., 1992; Rothschild et al., 2009; Schimel et al.,
2006). **[Because people possess a variety of resources for buffering
existential fear, terror management trajectories can be quite
malleable]{.underline}**. Thus, **[[increasing the salience
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a particular aspect of one's cultural
worldview, such as **[the [prosocial value of compassion, can motivate
increased adherence to this value after reminders of
death]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As such, examining the effects of MS in
light of individual differences in progressive value orientation might
be a useful direction for the future research on the psychology of
politics and/or intergroup relations. For example, emerging research
suggests that **[[compassion might be found in the perception of
interdependence among diverse groups of people]{.mark}, helping to
reduce or eliminate reactionary, hostile forms of worldview
defense]{.underline}**. Motyl et al. (2009) report that **[priming a
perception of a common humanity attenuated an increase in anti-Arab
prejudice and hostile immigration policy among Americans reminded of
death. [This compassionate]{.mark} perception]{.underline}** of a common
humanity **[[can]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[be
observed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather ominously, **[[in universal
dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., global warming) **[[that threaten
humanity as a whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In research conducted with
both Americans and Palestinians living in Israel, Pyszczynski et al.
(2009) demonstrated that the **[[perception of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
such **[[global threat bolsters support for peaceful coexistence in the
face of increased death awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Future
research on these values and concerns might provide useful directions
for those seeking peace and political harmony among groups embroiled in
long-standing conflicts. The present analysis of compassion also offers
potential insights into understanding reactions to other political
figures. Weise et al. (2008) found that MS motivated securely attached
adults to support John Kerry instead of Bush. Given that secure
attachment is linked to compassion and empathy (e.g., Mikulincer et al.,
2005), the existentially motivated activation of secure adult attachment
systems may have increased support for Kerry to the extent that he was
perceived as the more compassionate candidate. However, comparing the
current study with Weise et al. suggests a crucial distinction between
the ability of Obama and Kerry to capitalize on the MS-induced need to
achieve psychological equanimity by rigorously defending culturally
cherished values. Whereas both men might very well have been harbingers
of compassion, for Kerry, this may have been obscured by his relatively
dry speaking style and meeker presence; Obama, on the other hand, wore
compassion on his sleeve (Steinhauser, 2008). Thus, it may have been
that Obama's frequent, eloquent outbursts of compassion boosted his
support by priming thecultural defense of this value amid frequent
discussion of issues involving reminders of mortality (e.g., healthcare,
Iraqi occupation, Russian invasion of Georgia, etc.). It is important to
note, however, that the present analysis does not imply that
compassionate associations are limited only to Democratic candidates.
Indeed, as the quote which opens this paper illustrates, then-President
George W. Bush co-opted the term "compassionate conservative" during his
second campaign, a move that may have helped garner support, assuming
both that he was perceived as the more compassionate candidate and that
such values were made salient. The present
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[contributes to
understanding the nature and specificity of responses to thoughts of
death]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, &
Maxfield, 2006). Like a number of other studies, here we tested the
impact of MS against that of personal uncertainty. **[Proponents of the
uncertainty management model claim that MS effects are actually a result
of increased personal uncertainty, which motivates efforts to regain a
sense of certainty by defending the validity of one's cultural worldview
and confidently adhering to its norms and values (]{.underline}**e.g.,
Van Den Bos, Poortvliet, Marjolein, Miedema, & Van den Ham, 2005).
**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** present **[[study demonstrates that
uncertainty]{.mark} concerns [did not impact political
preferences]{.mark}, or produce reactions to cultural
values]{.underline}** (e.g., compassion) **[similar to those triggered
by MS]{.underline}**. The recently proposed **[uncertainty-threat
model]{.underline}** (e.g., Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003)
**[claims that uncertainty and mortality threat both produce a shift
toward political conservatism. Critics]{.underline}** of this model
(e.g., Anson et al., in press; Greenberg & Jonas, 2003), on the other
hand, **[have argued that the motivated social-cognitive
foundations]{.underline}** (i.e., dogmatism; intolerance of ambiguity;
personal need for closure, structure, or order; etc.) **[of political
ideology are not limited to a conservative shift]{.underline}**, but can
readily trigger support for progressive change. **[The present study
provides [clear and direct evidence for the latter contention:
MS-induced threat is]{.mark}]{.underline}** indeed **[[capable of
motivating support]{.mark} for either conservative or progressive
politicians, depending on the values that are salient at the
time]{.underline}**. This idea, however, does raise an interesting
possibility with regard to interpreting the present effects. The
compassionate value statements were designed for this study to directly
emphasize the value of compassion. While the comparison statements were
designed to lack such references, it is possible that these statements
might have been construed as priming wisdom. Previous research (e.g.,
Landau et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2004, 2005) demonstrated that MS
motivated increased support for authoritarian candidates, and for Bush
specifically, without moderating factors such as a wisdom induction.
This is consistent with the notion that Republican candidates tend to
enjoy increased support from those reminded of mortality because these
candidates tend to emphasize American superiority. However, McCain was
considerably older than Obama and held his Senate seat for much longer;
thus, he may have been seen as "wise" relative to Obama's "na¨ıvete." If
this were the case, and if the neutral value condition's statements did
´ prime wisdom, this may have motivated increased support for McCain
after death reminders. While the participants in this study were by no
means representative of the diverse American electorate, they provided
crucial insight into the psychological impact of each candidate's
campaign and even of the candidates themselves. **[Embedded within a
social climate boiling over with [death reminders]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(e.g., war, terrorism, fear-mongering rhetoric, etc.), **[people [may
latch onto certain political leaders in an effort to affirm their
faith]{.mark} in the permanence and validity of their particular
culture]{.underline}**. However, it would seem that **[the individual
can achieve this]{.underline}** leader-based worldview defense **[in
several different ways. [Depending on the salience of particular]{.mark}
cultural [values, a person might be motivated to follow a conservative
leader]{.mark} who rigorously asserts the fundamental superiority of
one's culture]{.underline}** and aggressively "defends" it from the
clutches of evil, **[[or they might be motivated to support progressive
prototypes of their more compassionate social
values]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Ernest Becker (1973, p. 139)
concluded, "\[The human\] is a trembling animal who pulls the world down
around his shoulders as he clutches for protection and support and tries
to affirm in a cowardly way his feeble powers. The qualities of the
leader, then, and the problems of people fit together in a natural
symbiosis.

#### Imagining future pathways to conflict is essential to challenge *nuclear overconfidence* and spills-up to more responsible policy-making -- even if we're not completely correct, recognizing the *fragility of the nuclear order* is essential

[Full [awareness of **the limits of**]{.mark} **knowledge** of **and
[control over nuclear weapons is crucial for]{.mark} historical
accuracy**, for [**nuclear learning**, and]{.mark} as a starting for a
**[fruitful]{.mark} nuclear weapons [policy debate]{.mark}** that would
include strategic, ethical, and political concerns. This]{.underline}
awareness [is all the more important as [overconfidence has]{.mark} been
[shown to be a cause of increased danger]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [learning from the Cuban Missile Crisis is essential given
that]{.underline}, over the last thirty years, [analysts have
discovered]{.underline} and confirmed that [it was one of the most
dangerous events in the history of the nuclear age]{.underline}, the
peaceful outcome of which was [partly due to luck, and that]{.underline}
in [the preceding three decades]{.underline} they [had been
overconfident in the ability of good management to explain its peaceful
outcome]{.underline}. In order to understand the construction of such
overconfidence, I have accepted the idea that learning occurred mostly
at the national level and focused on the French case, in comparative
perspective. I have first shown how those scholarly findings have not
been adequately refuted and argued that those who do not take these
elements seriously have done so via epistemological or practical
inconsistencies. The rejection of counterfactual thinking as a
legitimate scholarly practice is another way of rendering these findings
invisible without having to refute them. Finally, I have used the French
example to show that [[an experience]{.mark} and official memory [of the
Crisis that is **not based on fear** does]{.mark}]{.underline} over time
[[fuel **overconfidence** in the safety]{.mark}, controllability, and
predictability [of nuclear crises]{.mark}.]{.underline} American and
British elites and populations did not grasp the full extent of the
dangers at the time but, unlike the French, they certainly experienced
fear. These ideational and disciplinary factors would be sufficient to
prevent the problem from emerging as an issue of public concern in
France; they also call for responsible nuclear scholarship to address
them without waiting for structural or policy change. This opens up
three avenues for research. [First, [social scientists cannot
let]{.mark} Fidel [Castro take the]{.mark} unbearable [lightness of luck
with him to the grave]{.mark}]{.underline}. Following from the efforts
of cognitive psychologists to uncover our tendencies to deny luck
retrospectively, [[further exploration of]{.mark} the politics of luck
and how]{.underline} the distinction between [risk and
uncertainty]{.underline} (as uncontrollability and unknowability even of
the boundaries of the possible) [has been blurred would be a first
critical step towards [a reconceptualisation of nuclear
controllability]{.mark}]{.underline}, a reconceptualisation that would
place luck at the heart of political and ethical action, power and
responsibility over time.126 At the empirical level, [this approach
[would involve]{.mark}]{.underline} treating [[the question of **'how
close did we come to nuclear disaster' as a starting
point**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and focusing on pathways towards
disasters]{.mark} rather than]{.underline} patterns identified in [the
past]{.underline} and expected to bind possible futures. [Second, cases
of near-nuclear use need to be requalified as events worth
investigating]{.underline}.127 Diplomatic historians and security
studies scholars could fruitfully join forces independently of their
views on the value of counterfactuals. Indeed, we need further
investigations into the history of nuclear-armed states both to unearth
primary documentation about the past security and safety record of
nuclear arsenals and to allow for rigorous counterfactual thinking,
going beyond risk thinking.128 [Comparative **[critical]{.mark} oral
[histories of nuclear close calls]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
likewise [help [recover]{.mark}]{.underline} the limits of [[control
over]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} as a legitimate
object of scholarly interest. Such an approach would also tackle
directly the scholarly problem of uncritical reliance on accounts from
former officials, [[while]{.underline}]{.mark} at the same time
[[addressing]{.mark} the policy [problems that result from misguided
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} of a shared experience and
interpretation of events like the Crisis.129 The empirical dimension of
this article is only a first step in this direction.130
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} research programme [[allows analysts to
start working against overconfidence without waiting for]{.mark}
structural or [institutional reforms and suggests]{.mark} that [they
have a **responsibility** to do so]{.mark}. Third, in security studies,
it is crucial to reassert the socially]{.underline} and historically
[constructed process of valuation of nuclear weapons instead of
perpetuating the]{.underline} widespread [assumption]{.underline} that
the destructive capability of nuclear weapons triggers adequate fear,
which in turn initiates a learning process that is sufficient
[for]{.underline} existential [deterrence]{.underline} to work
everywhere. If the relevant French decision-makers were indeed
adequately afraid at the time but did not leave any evidence of it, the
contentions of this article would remain valid: that absence of evidence
would only be additional evidence of the scholarly blinders entailed by
a rejection of counterfactual thinking; in any case, and whatever the
unspoken thoughts of decision-makers at the time, their public display
of fearlessness would be consequential for future generations of
leaders. Evidence of private doubts on the part of statesmen would only
bring to the fore the need to reconnect nuclear weapons scholarship with
democratic theorising and the issue of citizens' right to know.
Identifying the effects of [rejecting counterfactual thinking and
[documenting]{.mark}]{.underline} the diverse experiences and
memorialisations of [[nuclear danger]{.underline}]{.mark} as components
of a process of valuation of nuclear weapons [are ways to understand and
counter overconfidence in their controllability]{.underline}. [This [is
**crucial** for policy-relevant learning]{.mark}]{.underline} because
the coexistence of this diversity of memories with the retrospective
illusions of unanimity and control gives an unsettling resonance to
Peter Sloterdijk's claim: 'the only catastrophe that seems clear to all
is the catastrophe which no one survives'. 131

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of
a nuclear war that kills 99% of the population would eventually be able
to recover civilisation without long-term effect. As we have seen, this
may not be a safe assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought
experiment, the point stands. What makes [existential
catastrophes]{.underline} especially bad is that they [would "destroy
the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick Bostrom,
puts it.66 [This future could]{.underline} potentially [be **extremely
long** and **full of flourishing**, and]{.underline} would therefore
[have **extremely large value**. In standard risk analysis]{.underline},
when working out how to respond to risk, [we [work out]{.mark} the
expected [value]{.mark}]{.underline} of risk reduction, [by weighing
**the probability**]{.underline} that [an action will prevent **an
adverse event** against **the severity** of the event.
Because]{.underline} the value of preventing [existential catastrophe is
**so vast**, **even [a tiny probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
prevention [[has **huge**]{.mark} **expected
[value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.67 Of course, there is persisting
reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one
might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future generations.
For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage,
governments have considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of
thousands, and even a million years.69 [Justifications]{.underline} for
this policy usually [appeal to principles of ***intergenerational
equity*** according to which **future generations** ought to get **as
much protection** as current generations]{.underline}.70 Similarly,
widely accepted norms of sustainable development require development
that meets the needs of the current generation without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.71 However, when
it comes to **[[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it
[would]{.underline} seem that we [[fail to live up to]{.mark} principles
of **intergenerational [equity]{.mark}**. Existential [catastrophe
would]{.mark} not only [give future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} **less
than the current generations**; it would give them
***[nothing]{.mark}***]{.underline}. Indeed, [reducing existential
risk]{.underline} plausibly [has **a quite low cost** for us in
comparison with **the huge expected value** it has for future
generations. In spite of this, **relatively little** is done to reduce
existential risk]{.underline}. Unless we give up on [norms of
**intergenerational equity**]{.underline}, they [give us **a strong
case**]{.underline} for significantly increasing our efforts [to reduce
existential risks]{.underline}. 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY In spite of the importance of [existential risk
reduction]{.underline}, it probably [receives **less attention** than is
warranted]{.underline}. As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to be
underinvested in. Firstly, it is *a global public good*. Economic theory
predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, [a country which reduces **existential risk** gains **only
a small portion** of the benefits but bears **the full brunt of the
costs**. Countries]{.underline} thus [have **strong incentives** to free
ride]{.underline}, receiving the benefits of risk reduction without
contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common interest.
Secondly, as already suggested above, [**existential risk reduction** is
**an *intergenerational* public good**]{.underline}: most of [the
benefits are enjoyed by **future generations** who have **no say** in
the political process]{.underline}. For these goods, [the [problem is
***temporal* free riding**]{.mark}: the current [gen]{.mark}eration
[enjoys]{.mark} **the benefits of [inaction]{.mark}** [while future
gen]{.mark}eration[s bear **the costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly,
many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence, engineered
pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented and uncertain
future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. **[Cognitive
[biases]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[lead people to underestimate
ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}. Since there have not been **any
catastrophes** of this magnitude, these risks are **not
salient**]{.underline} to politicians and the public.72 [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an example of the misapplication of [**the
*[availability]{.mark} [heuristic]{.mark}***, a mental shortcut which
[assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[something is important]{.mark}
**only [if]{.mark}** it can be **readily
[recalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Another cognitive
bias]{.underline}** affecting perceptions of existential risk [is
**[scope neglect]{.mark}**. In **a seminal 1992 study**, three groups
were asked how much they would]{.underline} be [willing to pay to save
2,000]{.underline}, 20,000 [or 200,000 birds]{.underline} from drowning
in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88,
respectively.73 In this case, [[the size of]{.mark} the
[benefits]{.mark} had [**little effect** on]{.mark} the scale of the
preferred [response]{.mark}. [People]{.mark} **become [numbed]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the effect of [saving lives when]{.mark} the [numbers get
**too large**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 74 [Scope neglect is **a
particularly acute problem** for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are **so large**]{.underline}. Due to scope neglect,
[decision-makers]{.underline} are prone to [treat existential
risks]{.underline} in a [similar]{.underline} way [to
problems]{.underline} which are [less severe by]{.underline} many orders
of [magnitude]{.underline}. A wide range of other cognitive biases are
likely to affect the evaluation of existential risks.75

In late February, Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[sent]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Russian troops]{.underline}]{.mark} [[into
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[sparking]{.mark} [a humanitarian
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
many scholars and analysts, has [[upended a]{.underline} [decades-old
global order]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

But [while some have]{.underline} characterized the
[conflict]{.underline} [as a]{.underline} [return to the
Cold]{.underline} War, one University of Chicago historian has argued
that we must look further back. According to Prof. Faith
[Hillis]{.underline}, **[[Putin]{.mark} [doesn't]{.mark} [seek
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[resurrect the Soviet
Union]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} [rather]{.mark}

even]{.mark} [more dangerous by modern surveillance
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

"I think [[he wants to reconstitute the]{.mark} [Russian
Empire]{.mark}]{.underline} and its guiding ideologies, [**[which were
orthodoxy]{.underline}**, **[autocracy and
nationality]{.underline}**---**[except]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[now,
[under]{.mark} the power of [a very sophisticated police
state]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Hillis, a professor of modern
Russian history.
