Ukrainian grain exports,]{.underline}]{.mark}** according to newly
declassified US intelligence.

US officials also released satellite images showing the damage inflicted
by Russian missile strikes earlier this month on Ukraine's second
biggest grain terminal at nearby Mykolaiv, at a time when the
interruption of grain exports threatens to trigger a global famine.
Sunflower oil storage tanks at Mykolaiv came under attack on Wednesday.

[Russia has denied laying mines]{.underline} [around the Black Sea
ports]{.underline}, and has turned around the allegations on Kyiv,
claiming instead the Ukrainians have mined their own ports.

[The US says its intelligence points]{.underline} [to a concerted
Russian strategy]{.underline} [to cut off the stretch of the coast still
under Ukrainian control]{.underline}. "The United States has information
that the Black Sea fleet is under orders to effectively blockade the
Ukrainian ports of Odesa and Ochakiv," a US official said.

"[We can confirm]{.underline} that despite Russia's public claims
[that]{.underline} it is not mining the north-western Black Sea,
**[Russia actually is deploying mines]{.underline}** [in the Black Sea
**near Ochakiv**.]{.underline} We also have indication that [Russian
forces previously mined the Dnieper River."]{.underline}

[["The impact]{.mark} of Russia's actions]{.underline}, which [have
**[caused a cessation of maritime trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
northern third of the Black Sea [[and]{.underline} [made the region

as [Ukraine's seaborne exports]{.underline} **[are vital to global food

supplied a 10th of global wheat exports and about **[[95%

[[accounts]{.underline} **[for 30 percent]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of

Ukraine exported 44.7 million tons of cereals and legumes, including
16.6 million tons of wheat, 23.1 million tons of corn, and 4.2 million
tons of barley. [Sea transport accounted for **92-96 percent** of bulk
**cargo exports**]{.underline}, including grain and oilseeds and
**[95-97 percent of oils]{.underline}** from Ukraine. Data from the
forecast of the investment company Dragon Capital and the World Bank
show how important Ukraine's ports are---if the Black Sea remains
closed, Ukraine's GDP will fall by 45 percent.

[[Because o]{.mark}f]{.underline} large-scale [[Russian]{.mark}
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[[six
seaports]{.underline}]{.mark}**](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/05/17/yak-prypynyty-blokuvannya-morskyh-portiv-ukrayiny/)---Yuzhny,
Mykolayiv, Olbia, Odesa, Chernomorsk, and Belgorod-Dniester---are unable
to accept and send cargo. The ports of Mariupol, Berdyansk, Skadovsk,
and Kherson **[[are]{.mark} [closed]{.mark}]{.underline}** due to their
temporary occupation.

Attempts are currently being made to conduct logistics through European
countries. The Prime Ministers of Ukraine and Poland signed
a [memorandum](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/premyer-ministri-ukrayini-ta-polshchi-pidpisali-memorandum-pro-posilennya-spivrobitnictva-v-zaliznichnij-sferi) to
strengthen cooperation in the railway sphere, which provides for the
establishment of a joint logistics company of the two countries. This
mechanism of cooperation will increase the volume of rail transportation
of Ukrainian exports to the EU and world markets through the Polish
ports of Gdynia and Gdansk.

Currently, cooperation in this area is being established with Romania,
Moldova, Lithuania, and Latvia. The possibility of using a number of
ports in four basins is being explored: the Baltic, the North Sea, the
Mediterranean basin, and the ports of the western Black Sea coast.

Ukraine is currently unifying and simplifying customs procedures with
our western neighbors, including European Commission members Romania,
Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, as well as Moldova to establish exports.
At the same time, [**[there is no]{.mark} [physical
alternative]{.mark}** [to seaports for export]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The issue of unblocking]{.mark} [ports]{.mark}]{.underline} [for
humanitarian purposes,]{.underline} [namely the avoidance of hunger**,
[is a priority for all]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [the United States, the
European Union, Britain, Africa, and the Middle East. In 2022,
**[Ukraine needs to export]{.mark} only [80 million tons of
wheat]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and the **[only option is through
Odessa]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Currently, [[the **world** has stocks]{.mark} of wheat in warehouses
[for **about ten weeks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first reason is
Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the blockade of ports, the
second is because India has banned its exports in recent weeks.

In Europe, support is growing for a naval operation to export Ukrainian
grain, which involves escorting Ukrainian grain ships by warships in the
Black Sea. The United Kingdom is negotiating with its allies to send a
navy to the Black Sea to protect ships loaded with Ukrainian grain.

Lithuania [proposes](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/05/23/7139912/) to
create a naval coalition to lift the Russian blockade on Ukrainian grain
exports across the Black Sea. A non-NATO naval escort operation could
protect grain ships as they cross the Black Sea and past Russian
warships. [[This plan]{.mark} **[requires de-mining]{.mark}** of parts
of the Black Sea **[to ensure safe passage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
well as an agreement with Turkey, which protects entrance into the
country's waters.

[Restoring Ukraine's [seaports is the **only** way to]{.mark} **[reduce
food prices]{.mark} [and avoid a humanitarian
catastrophe]{.mark}**---**[famine in the Middle East and North

**[[unless]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[conflict is resolved

Higher food prices mean that fewer African households will be able to
afford a single decent daily meal. Malnourishment will rise. Africa's
food-insecure households will be left much further behind. Their
consumption rates will fall, savings will be depleted, debt will
increase, and assets will be liquidated.

In short, [**[in a food crisis]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
[[millions]{.mark} [will be in danger]{.mark} of malnutrition and
deepened poverty]{.underline}.

Some African countries, such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa,
have domestic price controls and export restrictions in place. Benin has
instituted an export ban. Others --- such as [Malawi,
Zambia](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fwber%2Farticle%2F34%2F3%2F670%2F5611144&data=04%7C01%7Ceve.sabbagh%40undp.org%7C70a628a6e90b4e9e42d908da17412e39%7Cb3e5db5e2944483799f57488ace54319%7C0%7C0%7C637847865956030987%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=WXgBWUUIs087tIUHobQk5N6ydaWIkGXcUSHzzAA1EWo%3D&reserved=0),
and Uganda --- offer cash subsidies to vulnerable groups. But with the
sharp rise in fuel and energy prices, another consequence of the
situation in Ukraine, very few African countries will have the fiscal
space to sustain such policies, even if they wished to pursue them.

Food crisis and human security

Food insecurity in Africa is not just a socioeconomic issue. It is also
a matter of human security.

Rather than [[wars]{.underline}]{.mark} and insurgencies, [[riots and
protests]{.underline}]{.mark} now account for over half of violent
events in Africa, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location &
Event Data ([ACLED](https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/)). Recent
violent protests sparked by domestic price
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} in Sierra Leone illustrate how
[[inflationary pressures]{.underline} **[can easily foment
instability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Recall, too, how the Arab revolts in
the early 2010s sparked protests across North Africa.

High food prices typically hit the most vulnerable households hardest,
making them "multidimensionally poor," meaning they lack not just income
but also access to electricity, cooking fuel, and basic social services.
Shrinking budgets will cause households to dispose of their assets,
eroding their ability to cushion themselves against future shocks.
[[These]{.mark} indirect [effects]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the food
crisis **[will]{.mark} constrain economic activity, widen inequalities,
and could [trigger social tensions and unrest.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**Africa instability escalates**

[One of the **biggest questions of the 21st century** is whether [this
**destructive dynamic**]{.mark} can be contained, or whether the demand
for ethnic, cultural and/or religious homogeneity [will]{.mark} continue
to **[convulse world politics]{.mark}**, **drive new generations of
conflict**, and **create millions more victims**]{.underline}. [The
**Congo conflict**]{.underline} is a disturbing piece of evidence
**[suggest]{.underline}**ing that, in Africa at least, [[there is
potential for]{.mark} this kind of conflict]{.underline}. The Congo war
(and the long Hutu-Tutsi conflict in neighboring countries) is not,
unfortunately alone. The secession of South Sudan from Sudan proper, the
wars in what remains of that unhappy country, the secession of Eritrea
from Ethiopia and the rise of Christian-Muslim tension right across
Africa (where religious conflict often is fed by and intensifies
"tribal"---in Europe we would say "ethnic" or "national"---conflicts)
are strong indications that the potential for [**[huge]{.mark} and
[destructive conflict]{.mark}** [across Africa]{.mark}]{.underline} is
very real.

But one must look beyond Africa. The Middle East of course is aflame in
religious and ethnic conflict. The old British Raj including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka offers countless examples of
ethnic and religious conflict that sometimes is contained, and sometimes
boils to the surface in horrendous acts of violence.

Beyond that, rival nationalisms in East and Southeast Asia are keeping
the world awake at night.

[The Congo war should be a reminder to us all that the **[foundations of
our world are dynamite]{.mark}**, and that the [potential for]{.mark}
new [conflicts on the **scale of**]{.mark} **the horrific wars of [the
20th century]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} very much [with us]{.mark}
today]{.underline}.

The second lesson from this conflict stems from the realization of how
much patience and commitment from the international community (which in
this case included the Atlantic democracies and a coalition of African
states working as individual countries and through various international
institutions) it has taken to get this far towards peace. Particularly
at a time when many Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are
people who make the argument that it is really none of America's
business to invest time and energy in the often thankless task of
solving these conflicts.

That might be an ugly but defensible position if we didn't live in such
a tinderbox world. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible that
a million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific conflict,
but the war is really very far away and America has urgent needs at home
and we should husband the resources we have available for foreign policy
on things that have more power to affect us directly.

[The problem is that these [wars **spread**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They
may start in places that we don't care much about]{.underline} (most
Americans didn't give a rat's patootie about whether Germany controlled
the Sudetenland in 1938 or Danzig in 1939) [but they tend to spread to
places that we do care very much about]{.underline}. This can be because
a revisionist great power like Germany in 1938-39 needs to overturn the
balance of power in Europe to achieve its goals, or it can be because
[instability in a very remote place triggers problems in places that we
care about very much]{.underline}. Out of Afghanistan in 2001 came both
9/11 and the [waves of insurgency and [instability]{.mark} that threaten
to **rip nuclear-armed Pakistan apart** or **with [trigger]{.mark} wider
[conflict India]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Out of the mess in Syria a
witches' brew of terrorism and religious conflict looks set to
complicate the security of our allies in Europe and the Middle East and
even the security of the oil supply on which the world economy so
profoundly depends]{.underline}.

[**[Africa]{.mark}**, and the potential for upheaval there, [is
of]{.mark} **more [importance to American security]{.mark}** than many
people may understand]{.underline}. [The line **between Africa and the
Middle East** is a soft one]{.underline}. The **[weak
states]{.underline}** that straddle the southern approaches of the
Sahara [are **ideal petri dishes** for **Al Qaeda type
groups**]{.underline} [to form and attract local support]{.underline}.
[There are **networks** of funding and religious contact that give
groups in these countries potential access to **funds**, **fighters**,
**training** and **weapons** from the Middle East]{.underline}. [A
**[war in the]{.mark} eastern [Congo]{.mark}**]{.underline} might not
directly trigger these other conflicts, but it [helps to [create]{.mark}
the [**swirling underworld** of arms trading]{.mark}, money transfers,
[illegal commerce]{.mark} and the rise of a generation of young men who
become **[experienced fighters]{.mark}**---and know no other way to make
a living]{.underline}. [It **[destabilizes]{.mark}** the environment for
[neighboring states]{.mark} (like Uganda and Kenya) that play much more
direct role in potential crises of greater concern to us]{.underline}.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates --- For centuries, [[bread]{.mark} **[has
been the lifeblood of civilization.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Riots and
revolutions]{.underline} [have been sparked over the
availability]{.underline} [of this basic dietary]{.underline}
[staple]{.underline} --- [and over food prices more
broadly]{.underline}, [**[particularly]{.mark}** [when it comes
to]{.mark} **[the Middle East]{.mark} and North Africa**. ]{.underline}

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine now threatens a huge proportion
of the wheat and grain that these countries rely on. Together, [[Russia
and Ukraine account for roughly one-third of the world's global wheat
exports]{.underline}](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/putins-invasion-of-ukraine-could-spark-a-global-food-crisis/),
nearly 20% of its corn, and 80% of its sunflower oil --- and they
provide the majority of the MENA region's supply. 

Wheat futures are up 30% since the invasion began in late February.

Before the war, [more than **95% of Ukraine's total grain**, wheat and
corn exports was shipped out via [the Black Sea]{.mark},]{.underline}
and **[half of those exports went to MENA countries.]{.underline}**
[That vital conduit **[is now shut,]{.mark}**]{.underline} choking off
Ukraine's maritime trade after its ports came under attack from Russia's
military. 

The country is now trying to export some of its produce by rail, which
has enormous logistical limits, while Ukrainian farmers whose
infrastructure hasn't been destroyed attempt to till their fields
wearing bulletproof vests. 

Russia is the world's number one exporter of wheat, as well as --
crucially -- the top exporter of fertilizer. Fears of getting caught up
in western sanctions on Moscow have already disrupted Russia's exports,
too. 

Inflation and popular unrest 

[**All of [this is turbocharging]{.mark}** the **rising
[inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that's hitting the population of
roughly 500 million people, particularly its poorest and those already
facing high unemployment and worsening economic prospects. 

"Inflation and economics, more than political freedom, are key" for the
region's stability, Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council, told CNBC.

Alam pointed to the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, the young
Tunisian street vendor whose act of protest set off the Arab Spring
protests of 2011.  

"Even the vendor who burned himself in Tunis did so because of economic
indignation, not (then-Tunisian president) Ben Ali," he said. "One would
argue the first and foremost reason for unrest in the Arab world is
always lack of economic mobility."  

Inflation surged to 14.8% in the MENA region in 2021, according to the
International Monetary Fund. Already at that point, higher food prices
were the main driver --- making up about 60% of the increase in the
region, excluding the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council states.  

That was before the war in Ukraine began. Now, the U.N. says that food
prices as of April are 34% higher than they were one year ago. 

["[We've got now 45 million]{.mark} people in 38 countries that are
**[knocking on famine's door]{.mark}**]{.underline}," David Beasley,
executive director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, told CBS in an
interview last week. "And you may see a general price increase of food,
let's say 38 to 40%, but in some of the very tough places[, it's going
to be 100, 200% like in Syria."]{.underline}  

While countries will be looking for alternative sources for their
crucial food imports, surging global inflation and potential export
restrictions make switching expensive. And water scarcity across the
MENA region means local agricultural production is very limited.

Warnings of riots, famine and mass migration

Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, alone imports 80% of its
wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Lebanon, already years into a crippling
debt and inflation crisis, imports 60% of its wheat from the two warring
countries, which provide 80% of Tunisia's grain.     

[[Egypt]{.underline} "**[has a lot to lose from the
war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as]{.underline} [its]{.underline} bread
[subsidies]{.underline} [program reaches over half of the
population]{.underline} and forms a pillar of the social contract that
maintains stability in the most populous Arab state," said Amer
Alhussein, economic development expert and advisor for the post-conflict
initiative Plant for Peace. 

This, he says, could explain why Egypt's wealthy Gulf allies have rushed
to its aid with billions of dollars in funds for its central bank and
other investments to boost its economy. 

While Egypt's government can keep borrowing money, rising interest rates
in major economies and weak appetite for emerging market bonds will
weigh heavily on the country "and may become a sovereign risk factor and
lead to a default that would have a catastrophic impact on its
population," Alhussein added.

[[Lebanon]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[is facing "**many warnings
of an impending famine**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Alhussein said. "The
current situation could very soon develop into protests and riots like
the ones that took place in 2019, but with a much more violent impact
given the ever-worsening standard of life and food security in the
country." 

Further, [higher wheat prices alone]{.underline} "[can]{.underline}
increase (the Middle East's) external financing needs by up to \$10
billion in 2022," the IMF wrote in its latest Middle East and Central
Asia Regional Economic Outlook released Wednesday. "Supply shortages
originating from Russia and Ukraine can **[endanger food
security]{.underline}**, **[particularly for low-income
countries]{.underline}**, as they may also suffer from potential aid
diversion." 

About a quarter of Ukraine's latest pre-invasion wheat harvest is still
available on markets, but that will last roughly three months, analysts
say. 

This fall, the WFP's Beasley warns, is when the war's impact will really
hit MENA, in a crisis that he believes could trigger mass migration.  

["[If you think we've got hell]{.mark} on earth [now]{.mark}, **[you
just get ready,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} Beasley [warned in an
interview](https://www.politico.eu/article/world-food-programme-eu-fund-us-food-aid-ukraine-russia/) with
Politico in March. "[If we neglect]{.underline} northern Africa,
northern Africa's coming to Europe. If we neglect [the Middle
East,]{.underline} **[[the Middle East is coming to
Europe."]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based senior fellow in the international security
program at think tank New America, agreed that the worst may be yet to
come. 

"At a time of rising inflation, increased commodity prices and supply
chain gridlocks, the wider region could be in for an unprecedented
economic shock this summer," Rahim told CNBC. 

**["[A new political Pandora's box will be opened by the rising economic
discontent]{.mark} and we will see governments under increasing
pressure."]{.underline}**

Ukraine exported 44.7 million tons of cereals and legumes, including
16.6 million tons of wheat, 23.1 million tons of corn, and 4.2 million
tons of barley. [Sea transport accounted for **92-96 percent** of bulk

forecast of the investment company Dragon Capital and the World Bank
show how important Ukraine's ports are---if the Black Sea remains
closed, Ukraine's GDP will fall by 45 percent.

to accept and send cargo. The ports of Mariupol, Berdyansk, Skadovsk,
and Kherson **[[are]{.mark} [closed]{.mark}]{.underline}** due to their
temporary occupation.

Attempts are currently being made to conduct logistics through European
countries. The Prime Ministers of Ukraine and Poland signed
a [memorandum](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/premyer-ministri-ukrayini-ta-polshchi-pidpisali-memorandum-pro-posilennya-spivrobitnictva-v-zaliznichnij-sferi) to
strengthen cooperation in the railway sphere, which provides for the
establishment of a joint logistics company of the two countries. This
mechanism of cooperation will increase the volume of rail transportation
of Ukrainian exports to the EU and world markets through the Polish
ports of Gdynia and Gdansk.

Currently, cooperation in this area is being established with Romania,
Moldova, Lithuania, and Latvia. The possibility of using a number of
ports in four basins is being explored: the Baltic, the North Sea, the
Mediterranean basin, and the ports of the western Black Sea coast.

Ukraine is currently unifying and simplifying customs procedures with
our western neighbors, including European Commission members Romania,
Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, as well as Moldova to establish exports.
At the same time, [**[there is no]{.mark} [physical
alternative]{.mark}** [to seaports for export]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The issue of unblocking]{.mark} [ports]{.mark}]{.underline} [for
humanitarian purposes,]{.underline} [namely the avoidance of hunger**,
[is a priority for all]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [the United States, the
European Union, Britain, Africa, and the Middle East. In 2022,
**[Ukraine needs to export]{.mark} only [80 million tons of
wheat]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and the **[only option is through
Odessa]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Currently, [[the **world** has stocks]{.mark} of wheat in warehouses
[for **about ten weeks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first reason is
Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the blockade of ports, the
second is because India has banned its exports in recent weeks.

In Europe, support is growing for a naval operation to export Ukrainian
grain, which involves escorting Ukrainian grain ships by warships in the
Black Sea. The United Kingdom is negotiating with its allies to send a
navy to the Black Sea to protect ships loaded with Ukrainian grain.

Lithuania [proposes](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/05/23/7139912/) to
create a naval coalition to lift the Russian blockade on Ukrainian grain
exports across the Black Sea. A non-NATO naval escort operation could
protect grain ships as they cross the Black Sea and past Russian
warships. [[This plan]{.mark} **[requires de-mining]{.mark}** of parts
of the Black Sea **[to ensure safe passage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as

Higher food prices mean that fewer African households will be able to
afford a single decent daily meal. Malnourishment will rise. Africa's
food-insecure households will be left much further behind. Their
consumption rates will fall, savings will be depleted, debt will
increase, and assets will be liquidated.

In short, [**[in a food crisis]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
[[millions]{.mark} [will be in danger]{.mark} of malnutrition and
deepened poverty]{.underline}.

Some African countries, such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa,
have domestic price controls and export restrictions in place. Benin has
instituted an export ban. Others --- such as [Malawi,
Zambia](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fwber%2Farticle%2F34%2F3%2F670%2F5611144&data=04%7C01%7Ceve.sabbagh%40undp.org%7C70a628a6e90b4e9e42d908da17412e39%7Cb3e5db5e2944483799f57488ace54319%7C0%7C0%7C637847865956030987%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=WXgBWUUIs087tIUHobQk5N6ydaWIkGXcUSHzzAA1EWo%3D&reserved=0),
and Uganda --- offer cash subsidies to vulnerable groups. But with the
sharp rise in fuel and energy prices, another consequence of the
situation in Ukraine, very few African countries will have the fiscal
space to sustain such policies, even if they wished to pursue them.

Food crisis and human security

Food insecurity in Africa is not just a socioeconomic issue. It is also
a matter of human security.

Rather than [[wars]{.underline}]{.mark} and insurgencies, [[riots and
protests]{.underline}]{.mark} now account for over half of violent
events in Africa, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location &
Event Data ([ACLED](https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/)). Recent
violent protests sparked by domestic price
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} in Sierra Leone illustrate how
[[inflationary pressures]{.underline} **[can easily foment
instability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Recall, too, how the Arab revolts in
the early 2010s sparked protests across North Africa.

High food prices typically hit the most vulnerable households hardest,
making them "multidimensionally poor," meaning they lack not just income
but also access to electricity, cooking fuel, and basic social services.
Shrinking budgets will cause households to dispose of their assets,
eroding their ability to cushion themselves against future shocks.
[[These]{.mark} indirect [effects]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the food
crisis **[will]{.mark} constrain economic activity, widen inequalities,
and could [trigger social tensions and unrest.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**Africa instability escalates**

[One of the **biggest questions of the 21st century** is whether [this
**destructive dynamic**]{.mark} can be contained, or whether the demand
for ethnic, cultural and/or religious homogeneity [will]{.mark} continue
to **[convulse world politics]{.mark}**, **drive new generations of
conflict**, and **create millions more victims**]{.underline}. [The
**Congo conflict**]{.underline} is a disturbing piece of evidence
**[suggest]{.underline}**ing that, in Africa at least, [[there is
potential for]{.mark} this kind of conflict]{.underline}. The Congo war
(and the long Hutu-Tutsi conflict in neighboring countries) is not,
unfortunately alone. The secession of South Sudan from Sudan proper, the
wars in what remains of that unhappy country, the secession of Eritrea
from Ethiopia and the rise of Christian-Muslim tension right across
Africa (where religious conflict often is fed by and intensifies
"tribal"---in Europe we would say "ethnic" or "national"---conflicts)
are strong indications that the potential for [**[huge]{.mark} and
[destructive conflict]{.mark}** [across Africa]{.mark}]{.underline} is
very real.

But one must look beyond Africa. The Middle East of course is aflame in
religious and ethnic conflict. The old British Raj including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka offers countless examples of
ethnic and religious conflict that sometimes is contained, and sometimes
boils to the surface in horrendous acts of violence.

Beyond that, rival nationalisms in East and Southeast Asia are keeping
the world awake at night.

[The Congo war should be a reminder to us all that the **[foundations of
our world are dynamite]{.mark}**, and that the [potential for]{.mark}
new [conflicts on the **scale of**]{.mark} **the horrific wars of [the
20th century]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} very much [with us]{.mark}
today]{.underline}.

The second lesson from this conflict stems from the realization of how
much patience and commitment from the international community (which in
this case included the Atlantic democracies and a coalition of African
states working as individual countries and through various international
institutions) it has taken to get this far towards peace. Particularly
at a time when many Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are
people who make the argument that it is really none of America's
business to invest time and energy in the often thankless task of
solving these conflicts.

That might be an ugly but defensible position if we didn't live in such
a tinderbox world. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible that
a million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific conflict,
but the war is really very far away and America has urgent needs at home
and we should husband the resources we have available for foreign policy
on things that have more power to affect us directly.

[The problem is that these [wars **spread**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They
may start in places that we don't care much about]{.underline} (most
Americans didn't give a rat's patootie about whether Germany controlled
the Sudetenland in 1938 or Danzig in 1939) [but they tend to spread to
places that we do care very much about]{.underline}. This can be because
a revisionist great power like Germany in 1938-39 needs to overturn the
balance of power in Europe to achieve its goals, or it can be because
[instability in a very remote place triggers problems in places that we
care about very much]{.underline}. Out of Afghanistan in 2001 came both
9/11 and the [waves of insurgency and [instability]{.mark} that threaten
to **rip nuclear-armed Pakistan apart** or **with [trigger]{.mark} wider
[conflict India]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Out of the mess in Syria a
witches' brew of terrorism and religious conflict looks set to
complicate the security of our allies in Europe and the Middle East and
even the security of the oil supply on which the world economy so
profoundly depends]{.underline}.

[**[Africa]{.mark}**, and the potential for upheaval there, [is
of]{.mark} **more [importance to American security]{.mark}** than many
people may understand]{.underline}. [The line **between Africa and the
Middle East** is a soft one]{.underline}. The **[weak
states]{.underline}** that straddle the southern approaches of the
Sahara [are **ideal petri dishes** for **Al Qaeda type
groups**]{.underline} [to form and attract local support]{.underline}.
[There are **networks** of funding and religious contact that give
groups in these countries potential access to **funds**, **fighters**,
**training** and **weapons** from the Middle East]{.underline}. [A
**[war in the]{.mark} eastern [Congo]{.mark}**]{.underline} might not
directly trigger these other conflicts, but it [helps to [create]{.mark}
the [**swirling underworld** of arms trading]{.mark}, money transfers,
[illegal commerce]{.mark} and the rise of a generation of young men who
become **[experienced fighters]{.mark}**---and know no other way to make
a living]{.underline}. [It **[destabilizes]{.mark}** the environment for
[neighboring states]{.mark} (like Uganda and Kenya) that play much more
direct role in potential crises of greater concern to us]{.underline}.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates --- For centuries, [[bread]{.mark} **[has
been the lifeblood of civilization.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Riots and
revolutions]{.underline} [have been sparked over the
availability]{.underline} [of this basic dietary]{.underline}
[staple]{.underline} --- [and over food prices more
broadly]{.underline}, [**[particularly]{.mark}** [when it comes
to]{.mark} **[the Middle East]{.mark} and North Africa**. ]{.underline}

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine now threatens a huge proportion
of the wheat and grain that these countries rely on. Together, [[Russia
and Ukraine account for roughly one-third of the world's global wheat
exports]{.underline}](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/putins-invasion-of-ukraine-could-spark-a-global-food-crisis/),
nearly 20% of its corn, and 80% of its sunflower oil --- and they
provide the majority of the MENA region's supply. 

Wheat futures are up 30% since the invasion began in late February.

Before the war, [more than **95% of Ukraine's total grain**, wheat and
corn exports was shipped out via [the Black Sea]{.mark},]{.underline}
and **[half of those exports went to MENA countries.]{.underline}**
[That vital conduit **[is now shut,]{.mark}**]{.underline} choking off
Ukraine's maritime trade after its ports came under attack from Russia's
military. 

The country is now trying to export some of its produce by rail, which
has enormous logistical limits, while Ukrainian farmers whose
infrastructure hasn't been destroyed attempt to till their fields
wearing bulletproof vests. 

Russia is the world's number one exporter of wheat, as well as --
crucially -- the top exporter of fertilizer. Fears of getting caught up
in western sanctions on Moscow have already disrupted Russia's exports,
too. 

Inflation and popular unrest 

[**All of [this is turbocharging]{.mark}** the **rising
[inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that's hitting the population of
roughly 500 million people, particularly its poorest and those already
facing high unemployment and worsening economic prospects. 

"Inflation and economics, more than political freedom, are key" for the
region's stability, Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council, told CNBC.

Alam pointed to the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, the young
Tunisian street vendor whose act of protest set off the Arab Spring
protests of 2011.  

"Even the vendor who burned himself in Tunis did so because of economic
indignation, not (then-Tunisian president) Ben Ali," he said. "One would
argue the first and foremost reason for unrest in the Arab world is
always lack of economic mobility."  

Inflation surged to 14.8% in the MENA region in 2021, according to the
International Monetary Fund. Already at that point, higher food prices
were the main driver --- making up about 60% of the increase in the
region, excluding the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council states.  

That was before the war in Ukraine began. Now, the U.N. says that food
prices as of April are 34% higher than they were one year ago. 

["[We've got now 45 million]{.mark} people in 38 countries that are
**[knocking on famine's door]{.mark}**]{.underline}," David Beasley,
executive director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, told CBS in an
interview last week. "And you may see a general price increase of food,
let's say 38 to 40%, but in some of the very tough places[, it's going
to be 100, 200% like in Syria."]{.underline}  

While countries will be looking for alternative sources for their
crucial food imports, surging global inflation and potential export
restrictions make switching expensive. And water scarcity across the
MENA region means local agricultural production is very limited.

Warnings of riots, famine and mass migration

Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, alone imports 80% of its
wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Lebanon, already years into a crippling
debt and inflation crisis, imports 60% of its wheat from the two warring
countries, which provide 80% of Tunisia's grain.     

[[Egypt]{.underline} "**[has a lot to lose from the
war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as]{.underline} [its]{.underline} bread
[subsidies]{.underline} [program reaches over half of the
population]{.underline} and forms a pillar of the social contract that
maintains stability in the most populous Arab state," said Amer
Alhussein, economic development expert and advisor for the post-conflict
initiative Plant for Peace. 

This, he says, could explain why Egypt's wealthy Gulf allies have rushed
to its aid with billions of dollars in funds for its central bank and
other investments to boost its economy. 

While Egypt's government can keep borrowing money, rising interest rates
in major economies and weak appetite for emerging market bonds will
weigh heavily on the country "and may become a sovereign risk factor and
lead to a default that would have a catastrophic impact on its
population," Alhussein added.

[[Lebanon]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[is facing "**many warnings
of an impending famine**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Alhussein said. "The
current situation could very soon develop into protests and riots like
the ones that took place in 2019, but with a much more violent impact
given the ever-worsening standard of life and food security in the
country." 

Further, [higher wheat prices alone]{.underline} "[can]{.underline}
increase (the Middle East's) external financing needs by up to \$10
billion in 2022," the IMF wrote in its latest Middle East and Central
Asia Regional Economic Outlook released Wednesday. "Supply shortages
originating from Russia and Ukraine can **[endanger food
security]{.underline}**, **[particularly for low-income
countries]{.underline}**, as they may also suffer from potential aid
diversion." 

About a quarter of Ukraine's latest pre-invasion wheat harvest is still
available on markets, but that will last roughly three months, analysts
say. 

This fall, the WFP's Beasley warns, is when the war's impact will really
hit MENA, in a crisis that he believes could trigger mass migration.  

["[If you think we've got hell]{.mark} on earth [now]{.mark}, **[you
just get ready,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} Beasley [warned in an
interview](https://www.politico.eu/article/world-food-programme-eu-fund-us-food-aid-ukraine-russia/) with
Politico in March. "[If we neglect]{.underline} northern Africa,
northern Africa's coming to Europe. If we neglect [the Middle
East,]{.underline} **[[the Middle East is coming to
Europe."]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based senior fellow in the international security
program at think tank New America, agreed that the worst may be yet to
come. 

"At a time of rising inflation, increased commodity prices and supply
chain gridlocks, the wider region could be in for an unprecedented
economic shock this summer," Rahim told CNBC.

discontent]{.mark} and we will see governments under increasing

<https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/FOOD/zjvqkgomjvx/>, JH

[**Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in late February dramatically
worsened** the outlook for already inflated **global food
prices**.]{.underline}

The halt in Ukrainian exports following the outbreak of the conflict
pushed the Food and Agriculture Organization\'s (FAO) food price index,
which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food
commodities, to its highest point in March since records began in 1990.

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, a move Russia calls a \"special
operation\" to demilitarise its neighbour, is the latest development in
a growing global food crisis.

[**[While]{.mark} [post-pandemic]{.mark} global [demand]{.mark},
[extreme weather]{.mark}, tightening food stocks, [high energy
prices]{.mark}, [supply chain bottlenecks]{.mark} and export
restrictions and taxes [have been straining]{.mark} the food market for
two years**, the recent [convergence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} all these
[factors]{.mark} following Russia's invasion [is
unprecedented]{.mark}]{.underline} and has sent food inflation rates
spiking around the world.

In Europe, the Consumer Price Index for food has sharply risen in all of
the continent's largest economies, while in the United States the CPI
climbed more than 14 percentage points since January 2020.

In developing and emerging market countries, the index change is even
more dramatic, leaving consumers facing much higher prices for essential
food staples.

The most extreme examples have seen food inflation rise hundreds of
points. Lebanon, a country that is heavily reliant on food imports
including most of its wheat from Ukraine, saw the price index rise more
than 3,000 percentage points since 2020.

[In many developing nations, [food]{.mark} is the single largest
category in the overall Consumer Price Index --- the selection of goods
economists use to calculate people\'s overall cost of
living]{.underline}. It accounts for about 40% on average, [while **it
[rises to half]{.mark} the total [cost of living]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
consumers in [India and Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, International
Monetary Fund data shows.

[**Rising [prices]{.mark} for basic food items have [already
fueled [protests in countries around the
world](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/surging-food-prices-fuel-protests-across-developing-world-2022-05-18/)]{.mark}**,
including Argentina, Indonesia and Greece. In Iran, protestors took to
the streets after prices for flour-based staples rose as much as
300%.]{.underline}

[The [war]{.mark} has [disrupted]{.mark} global agricultural exports
from Russia and Ukraine, **two [grain exporting powerhouses that
accounted for 24% of global wheat exports]{.mark} by trade value, [57%
of sunflower]{.mark} seed [oil]{.mark} exports [and 14% of corn]{.mark}
from 2016 to 2020**]{.underline}, according to data from UN Comtrade.

[In the 8 months before the invasion, 51 million metric tons of grain
passed through Ukraine's seven Black Sea ports]{.underline}, according
to the United Nations' World **[Food]{.underline}** Programme (WFP).

[Since the invasion, much of [Ukraine's]{.mark} [current]{.mark}
[export]{.mark} grain stock [has been stuck]{.mark} in the war-torn
country **[because of closed ports]{.mark} and Russian blockades [in the
Black Sea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Those blockages also mean there won't
be sufficient storage available when the 2022 harvest comes in,
according to the WFP.

[**The [shortfall]{.mark} [could have devastating consequences]{.mark}
for many countries who relied on Ukraine and Russia** for as much as
half of their wheat imports]{.underline} from 2016 to 2020, including
Egypt, who recently made a deal with India to help replace some of the
80% of its wheat imports which come from Russia and Ukraine.

In Europe, [the war in Ukraine has mangled major shipping lines through
the Baltic and Black Seas]{.underline}, and several key European
countries have also banned Russian-flagged vessels from their ports,
blocking some Russian grains.

The acute effects of the conflict have only added to global transport
issues. An early May study by analysts at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)
found that one-fifth of the global container ship fleet was currently
stuck in congestion at various major ports.

[**Global supply chain problems look set to worsen as China\'s COVID-19
lockdowns**, Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine and other strains cause even
longer delays at ports and drive up shipping costs.]{.underline}

[**With food prices rocketing, a growing list of key producing
[countries are limiting exports to stabilise]{.mark} [prices]{.mark}**
and protect local markets.]{.underline}

According to data from David Laborde Debucquet and Abdullah Mamun at the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), [restrictions on
food and food-related commodities in 2022 could impact as much as 17% of
globally traded calories]{.underline}.

[Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, **[over 20 countries]{.mark} around
the world [have imposed restrictions]{.mark}** [on food
exports]{.mark}]{.underline}, including export licences and taxes as
well as outright bans.

IFPRI data show that more than two thirds of those restrictions targeted
grain exports, such as wheat, rye and barley.

[In late April**, [Indonesia]{.mark} [banned]{.mark} most [exports of
palm oil]{.mark}** [to protect domestic supplies]{.mark} of cooking oil.
The ban shut out the rest of the world from the largest producer of the
edible oil, used in everything from cakes to margarine.]{.underline}

[**[India\'s May ban on wheat exports delivered a fresh blow to world
markets]{.mark}**, as a scorching heat wave in the country curtailed
output]{.underline} and domestic prices hit a record high.

[The [impact]{.mark} of recent export bans has **also [rippled into the
energy market]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Cereals and vegetable [oils]{.mark} are [major components of
biofuels]{.mark}, demand for which has ballooned as countries try to
find alternatives to fossil fuels]{.underline}. Biofuels had become
particularly attractive to the EU as the bloc races to reduce its
reliance on Russian oil and gas.

[[The EU, already in the midst of an energy crisis]{.mark} -- and
dependent on Russia for 40% of its gas and 27% of oil
imports]{.underline} -- produces 34% of the world's biodiesel from
vegetable oils, according to data from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development - Food and Agriculture Organization
(OECD-FAO).

**[Sky-high [fertiliser]{.mark} [prices]{.mark} have farmers worldwide
[reducing planned harvests]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the amount of land
they\'re planting.

[The [fertiliser crisis is]{.mark} in some respects [more worrying
because it]{.mark} [[could inhibit food production in the rest of the
world](https://www.reuters.com/business/sanctions-bite-russia-fertilizer-shortage-imperils-world-food-supply-2022-03-23/) that
could help take up the slack]{.mark} from stalled Ukrainian and Russian
grain deliveries]{.underline}, according to Maximo Torero, chief
economist for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

\"If we don\'t resolve the problem of fertiliser, and trade of
fertilisers doesn\'t continue, then we\'ll have a very serious problem
of \[food\] supply next year,\" Torero told Reuters.

[Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea
and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those natural
resources around the globe]{.underline}. China last year imposed
fertiliser export curbs to protect its own farmers as global prices
soared due to strong demand and high energy prices.

Russia and China exported 28% of the world's fertilisers in terms of
trade value from 2016 to 2020 according to a Reuters analysis of UN
Comtrade data.

[The strain can be seen in agricultural powerhouse Brazil, where some
farmers are applying less fertiliser to their corn]{.underline}, and
some federal legislators are pushing to open protected indigenous lands
for the mining of potash.

In Zimbabwe and Kenya, small farmers are reverting to using manure to
nourish their crops.

**Ukrainian crisis disrupt global markets**

**Strubenhoff 22**, Heinz Strubenhoff was a senior operations officer at
the International Finance Corporation, 6/14/22, "The war in Ukraine
triggered a global food shortage," Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2022/06/14/the-war-in-ukraine-triggered-a-global-food-shortage/

[**Russian ships and sea mines block Ukrainian Black Sea
port**s]{.underline}. Before the war, [Ukraine exported on average about
6 million tons of agri-commodities monthly to countries in the Middle
East, Asia, and Africa]{.underline}. Currently, only about 15 to 20
percent of this volume can be exported via rail, Danube river, and
trucks (about 700,000 tons in April 2022 and about [1 million tons in
May
2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/31/1102277441/how-to-get-20-million-tons-of-grain-out-of-ukraine?fbclid=IwAR2XgmISKAwMaDFCfVw9XU2_rKNIdsoxXwJ-s5cCyrVgkCrP6hJOUyT3pIo&t=1654513337407&t=1654699533940)).
Also, trade risks related to Russian exports have been increasing due to
sanctions by various trade partners and banks. This led to price spikes
and supply chain disruptions significantly undermining food security in
poor importing countries.

**[[Global trade](https://www.igc.int/en/default.aspx) of cereals except
rice is a little less than 20 percent of total world
production]{.underline}** (about 620 million of about 3.3 billion tons
produced in 2020/2021). [Total production is sufficient to feed all 8
billion inhabitants of the world, but production in semiarid countries
is less and some countries are behind their potential]{.underline}.
That's why trade plays an important role to balance global supply and
demand. In the [2020/21
season](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde), Russia provided 52.32
million tons (7.8 percent) and Ukraine 69.82 million tons (11.3 percent)
of cereals to the world.

**[Ukraine also exports oilseeds]{.underline}** (sunflower, soybeans,
rapeseed) [with a well-established crushing industry to produce
sunflower oil. [Fifty-two
percent](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=76856) of globally
traded sunflower seed and oil came from Ukraine in 2020]{.underline}.
Currently, edible-oil supply chains are disrupted and edible-oil prices
increased even higher than cereals prices. In the last weeks, the author
couldn't buy any sunflower oil in his neighborhood in Hamburg/Germany.

[**Global cereal and oilseed markets were tight even before the crisis
due to shrinking stocks leading to upward price trends**. This new
supply shock led to prices almost doubling compared with two years
ago.]{.underline} Agri-commodity market demand is inelastic---people
have to eat---and this leads to dire consequences in poor importing
countries. The number of people whose food supply is insecure (about 800
million) and people
facing [hunger](https://www.globalhungerindex.org/) (about 44 million)
will most likely grow. This will result in increased poverty and
threaten social stability in poor importing countries.

[[Global stocks](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde) are
shrinking. Global wheat stocks of about 300 million tons are sufficient
to cover about four months of annual global consumption.]{.underline} Of
these stocks, about 50 percent (about 150 million tons) are held in
China. We know from the past that prices go up if stocks reach a certain
critical low level. In this situation, crisis-induced trade disruptions
accelerate market developments and may even lead to government
interventions limiting exports to protect national interests. If many
countries do this, it has disastrous effects on world markets.

[**Ukrainian current cereal [stocks](https://ucab.ua/ua) are estimated
at about 20 to 25 million tons**. The new harvest in the fall will be
much lower than last year due to less acreage and lower intensity caused
by lack of necessary inputs and finance]{.underline}. Estimates are
difficult, but [market observers](https://ucab.ua/ua) say it would be
about 20 to 30 percent less or about 30 million tons. Assuming constant
domestic demand, this would lead to about 40 to 50 percent lower exports
in 2022. So, if the Black Sea ports remain blocked till the end of this
year, the world will have about 55 million tons less of cereals. To put
this into perspective, consider that 1 ton of cereals may feed a family
of six for a full year. So, this missing number of cereals would mean we
would have less food for more than 300 million people.

[And it can get even worse if we consider constrained exports
of [fertilizer](https://www.fertilizer.org/). The share of Russia and
Belarus in global potash trade is 40 percent. Russia alone exports about
20 percent of nitrogen and 10 percent of phosphate. Fertilizer prices
are increasing. As a consequence of higher cereal and oilseed prices,
production in poor importing countries can be expected to increase but
this will partly be offset by higher input prices.]{.underline} Poor
importing countries in Africa may try to incentivize higher production
to feed a growing population, but they would need tremendous efforts of
finance, and investments to reach this goal. Even with more resources
channeled to agriculture in Africa, supply would react with a time lag.

[The **world is facing a global food crisis as a result of the war in
Ukraine**]{.underline}, with soaring prices being felt around the world
as a result of Russia's invasion --- [and **naval mines are a big part
of the problem**]{.underline}.

[Russia and Ukraine are trading increasingly frequent barbs over the
mines in the Black Sea]{.underline}, which are being used by Russia to
its political advantage as its blockade of Ukraine's ports continues.

"[**The biggest impediment to the grain exports is clearly the Russian
blockade**s, and that includes the mines]{.underline}," Maximilian Hess,
central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC
Thursday.

"The real issue going forward is that Russia seems intent on using this
as an instrument of leverage."

Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of using the mines to disrupt
shipping and prevent grain exports from being able to leave the country,
a factor that has contributed to global food prices rising.

[Ukraine has even accused Russia of setting Soviet-era naval mines
adrift [in order to purposefully disrupt
shipping](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-trades-accusations-with-ukraine-drifting-black-sea-mines-2022-03-31/)]{.underline} and
global food supplies, saying that such mines were effectively
"uncontrolled drifting ammunition."

[[Russia denies this and has, in turn, blamed
Ukraine](https://tass.com/defense/1430661?utm_source=google.com&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=google.com&amp;utm_referrer=google.com) for
the un-moored mines]{.underline}. Moscow has also blamed the
international sanctions imposed on the country for the global food
crisis, and said that exports can restart as soon as Ukraine removes the
mines from its ports.

[Ukraine has refused to do that, saying it will allow Russia to attack
more of its coastline]{.underline}. Odesa, its last main functioning
port (and a mined one at that) further westward along the Black Sea
coast, is particularly vulnerable.

William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control at
the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNBC that
Ukraine would have been "crazy" not to have mined the approaches to its
ports and that its reluctance to remove them now was rational.

"[You can completely understand why Ukraine would be using sea mines
right now. The chance of amphibious assault on Odesa has been something
explicitly made by the Russians]{.underline}," he said Thursday.

But strategists agree that Russia is now using the mines to its economic
and military advantage.

"**[The mines are a real barrier to grain exports from
Ukraine]{.underline}** \... and they're a big problem," Sidharth
Kaushal, a naval power expert with the Royal United Services Institute
think tank, told CNBC Thursday, noting that Russia had been strategic
about the mines.

"[It is certainly an excuse for the Russians that they're there because
they can selectively de-mine ports they control, try to reroute trade,
and maintain a de facto blockade over Odesa whilst claiming that this is
all on the Ukrainians."]{.underline}

Ukraine does not deny mining its own ports in order to protect them from
an amphibious attack by Russia, given that one of its key war objectives
is to gain control of Ukraine's ports along the Black Sea coast. These
include Odesa and those along the Sea of Azov, like Mariupol, which
Russia seized after a dogged, aggressive siege.

[**The [crisis in Ukraine is the next tectonic disruption]{.mark}**

This [latest threat]{.mark} to semiconductor production [may be the most
significant yet]{.mark}**: It is poised to send shockwaves rippling
through a range of manufacturing sectors]{.underline}, including high
tech, automotive, consumer electronics, and household appliances.

[The root of the issue is that **[Ukraine is a prime supplier of neon
ga]{.mark}s**]{.underline} --- which is required to operate the lasers

[The concentration of these strategically essential gases in Ukraine is

byproduct of steel production, specifically from older steel mills that
today are largely located in eastern Ukraine. The former Soviet Union
(which included today's Ukraine) had many of these large steel mills,
which were outfitted with air separation equipment to capture rare waste
gases, including neon, krypton, and xenon, for use in experimental
high-powered laser weapons, missiles, and satellites. After the
dissolution of the USSR in 1991, these older steel facilities were
largely replaced with new infrastructure that had no gas-collection
technology because the economics did not support it. [In contrast, by

regime. Last week, ships from the [**[U.S. Fifth Fleet]{.mark} were
sailing through international waters [in the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}
when they were [threatened]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} high-speed, head-on
assaults by three naval vessels from [Iran\'s]{.mark} Islamic
Revolutionary [Guards]{.mark} Corps]{.underline}.

The U.S. coastal patrol ship USS Sirocco had to fire a warning flare
when the IRGC vessels, acting in a hostile manner, came within 50 yards
of their ship. [The threatening and dangerous behavior lasted for more
than an hour before the IRGC boats departed.]{.underline}

The Strait of Hormuz lies between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman,
providing the only sea passage to the Indian Ocean for crude oil from
many of the world\'s largest producers. [An average of **[21 million
barrels]{.mark} a day [flows through the strait]{.mark}, which is over
[20% of global consumption]{.mark}**. Around one-third of the world\'s
sea-borne petroleum and nearly all the liquefied gas from
Qatar]{.underline}, the leading global gas exporter, passes through this
constricted chokepoint only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point.

**[[With]{.mark} the [current global energy crisis]{.mark} caused by
Russia\'s illegal invasion of Ukraine, [the route has become even more
strategically critical]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the theocratic regime
faces crisis upon crisis at home and abroad, supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi, known as the \"Butcher of
Tehran,\" have ramped up their aggressive activities in the strait to
frighten those they regard as the regime\'s enemies, even threatening to
close the strait altogether.

The most recent naval encounter is not the first. In June 2019,
[**[limpet mines were left behind by IRGC commandos]{.mark}** following
attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The oil tanker Kokuka
Courageous was rocked by several explosions that caused extensive
damage]{.underline}. An IRGC patrol boat was then filmed moving
alongside the tanker as commandos removed an unexploded limpet mine from
the hull of the vessel. Following the attack, the Kokuka Courageous,
along with the Norwegian-owned Front Altair, were towed to the Emirati
coast by U.S. naval authorities.

In July 2019[, **Iran seized the British-flagged Stena Impero on the
Strait of Hormuz**. It was held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas for
two months and only released following international
pressure.]{.underline} In January 2021[, the IRGC seized a South
Korean-flagged tanker in Gulf waters]{.underline}, claiming it had
detained the Hankuk Chemi tanker and its crew for allegedly dumping
toxic chemicals in the Gulf, a blatantly false accusation. In the same
week, [explosives experts had to defuse an Iranian limpet mine attached
to a Liberian-flagged oil tanker in waters off the Iraqi port of
Basra]{.underline}. Sailors on board the MT Pola said they had
discovered a limpet mine of the type commonly deployed by naval divers.
It had been attached to the side of the tanker and could have caused
devastating damage had it exploded, particularly as the MT Pola was
refueling another tanker at the time with a ship-to-ship transfer to the
MT Nordic Freedom, a Bermuda-flagged tanker.

In May 2021, [an IRGC speedboat armed with heavy machine guns,
approached within 150 yards of U.S. warships at high speed, as the
Americans traveled through the Strait of Hormuz. Warning shots had to be
fired at the IRGC vessel before it finally withdrew]{.underline}. Then
in August 2021, a tanker was hijacked by IRGC commandos and ordered to
\"sail to Iran\" \-- days after an IRGC drone attack killed a British
security guard working with special forces and a Romanian soldier on the
MV Mercer Street. A nine-strong armed group climbed on board the Asphalt
Princess off the coast of the Gulf of Oman close to the Strait of
Hormuz, seizing the vessel at gunpoint[. Iran, as usual, denied
involvement in the suspected drone attack and the
hijacking.]{.underline}

[**The [mullahs]{.mark} clearly [believe]{.mark} that their [aggressive
conduct will lead to U.S. capitulation over the stalled nuclear
talks]{.mark}**. They will surely have to think again. Negotiations to
reinstate the tattered Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal,
signed by U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015 and torn up by President
Donald Trump in 2018, have run aground due to the mullahs\' farcical
demands]{.underline}. Iran is insisting on the lifting of all sanctions
and the delisting of the IRGC as an international terrorist
organization.

[Using the **[IRGC to threaten shipping in the Strait of
Hormuz]{.mark}** is hardly likely to encourage American
sympathy.]{.underline} Indeed, the United States knows that the IRGC and
its extra-territorial Quds Force is behind all Iran\'s proxy wars in
Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza and is known to sponsor
international terror worldwide. [**The [regime\'s]{.mark} foreign
[wars]{.mark} and acts of terror [are a calculated strategy to distract
their enraged and starving population]{.mark}** from another nationwide
uprising that could sweep the mullahs from power.]{.underline}

[The foolish attempt at gunboat diplomacy has taken place during a
disastrous year for the ruling dictatorship in Iran. **[The economy has
collapsed, unemployment is pervasive]{.mark}**, inflation is out of
control, the Iranian currency is in freefall and over 75% of the 80
million population are struggling to survive]{.underline} on incomes
below the international poverty line. There are daily protests in towns
and cities throughout Iran.

small window of opportunity if we can clear the mines to de-escalate**

[\"Bombs away\" should not be the first military response from the
United States, but respond we must. **[Closing international waters
is]{.mark} a blockade -- essentially [an act of war]{.mark} against
other states**]{.underline}.

[Were we to stand idly by and let any nation shut down a vital
international passage, **it would lend credence to the view that the
United States is now too weakened and timid to defend its sovereign
rights**.]{.underline} To ignore such aggression would be like giving
the Barbary Pirates a pass when they ravaged U.S. shipping in the early
1800s.

And, don\'t buy the line that it\'s none of our business. [[Over a third
of the world\'s oil transported]{.mark} by sea [goes through the
strait.]{.mark} If that flow stops, you can bet the farm it will cause
huge problem here at home]{.underline}.

When the Heritage Foundation war-gamed this scenario back in 2007,
**[the [impact was immediate]{.mark}: a [near doubling in the cost of a
barrel of oil]{.mark} and a [loss of 1 million domestic
jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Though closing the straits is an act of war, responses in war ought to
be proportional. [Thus, **[the first U.S. military objective ought to be
to reopen the straits]{.mark}**, and you don\'t have to attack Iran to
do that]{.underline}.

Consider 1987, when Iran tried to interfere with the passage of oil
through the strait. President Ronald Reagan authorized Operation Ernest
Will. The U.S. Navy protected ships going through the straits and only
conducted military operations in defense of the tankers or U.S. forces.

That should be the going-in strategy today. If Iranian attacks were to
persist, then a proportional and responsible act would be to take out
the bases or support infrastructure where the attacks originate.

[**And [if the Iranians still didn\'t get the message]{.mark}, the
[target set should then be expanded to]{.mark} things that the regime
values: targets like the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Headquarters,
[government]{.mark} facilities, [and]{.mark} other [military
facilities]{.mark}** -- including those contributing to Tehran\'s
nuclear weapon and ballistic missile program.]{.underline}

Going after these targets might require taking out Iranian command and
control and air defense sites. That would be justified.

**[[At no point]{.mark} along the way [would the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [need to ask the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations or
anyone else [for permission]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The United States
would just be exercising its inherent right as a nation to act in
self-defense.

on June 29 without
any [progress](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/29/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-talks-end-no-progress/index.html).   

"**[[We will not hesitate to use force]{.mark} to keep our citizens
safe]{.underline}**," Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said at an
Israeli Defense Forces graduation ceremony on July 8. [He [cited a
nuclear Iran]{.mark}, Hezbollah's precision-guided missiles in Lebanon,

posing [challenging
threats](https://www.timesofisrael.com/lapid-tells-graduating-idf-officers-that-israels-mission-is-to-restore-trust/) to
Israel's security.]{.underline}

[A former Israeli national security advisor had warned earlier that
Israel must prevent Iran from building bases in Syria at

Israel has regularly carried
out [airstrikes](https://syriaaccountability.org/the-legality-of-israeli-airstrikes-in-syria/) against
Iranian-backed forces in Syria---including
the [bombing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/14/syria-damascus-airport-bombed/) of
Damascus airport in early June forcing its closure for several
weeks---in a bid to stop weapons shipments
to [Hezbollah](https://www.mei.edu/publications/hezbollahs-regional-activities-support-irans-proxy-networks),
which has close links with Iran. Israel
reportedly [coordinated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-secretly-reviews-israels-plans-for-strikes-against-iranian-targets-in-syria-11655405162) these
and earlier airstrikes closely with Washington, according to a report
published in the Wall Street Journal. 

[In early June, **[Israel conducted
military [drills](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220602-israel-holds-military-drills-amid-iran-tensions-1) in
the Mediterranean]{.mark}** and Red Sea that were clearly [meant to send
a message]{.mark} that it isn't ruling out the military option to stop
Iran]{.underline} from obtaining a nuclear bomb.

[**Meanwhile, [US patience with Iran is wearing thin]{.mark};** it
appears that Biden's visit to Israel on July 13 and his subsequent
meeting with the Gulf Cooperation Council ([GCC]{.mark}) and Arab
leaders in Saudi Arabia on July 15-16 may [likely be a prelude to an
escalation against Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}.

GCC member states---Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the
United Arab Emirate (UAE)---[share Israel's [concerns about]{.mark}
**[Iran's "[sponsorship of
terrorism](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/06/tehran-denounces-gcc-over-missile-comments)"
and its expansionist goals]{.mark}**, which they perceive as threats to
their security]{.underline}. Several of these Gulf states have sizable
Shia minorities and accuse Iran---which is predominantly Shia---of
fomenting [sectarian](https://studies.aljazeera.net/ar/node/1071) tensions
in their countries---accusations that aren't entirely baseless. 

[The flurry of diplomatic activity in the region ahead of Biden's Middle
East trip, is part of efforts by the GCC and **Arab leaders to
coordinate [stances](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/06/egypts-sisi-arab-leaders-coordinate-positions-ahead-biden-visit) and
forge a unified force against Iran**]{.underline}. This included a
regional tour by Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS) in late
June that took him to Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey;  visits by Egyptian
President Abdel Fattah el Sisi to Oman and Bahrain on June 27-30 and a
recent,
little-publicized [meeting](https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-hosted-secret-meetings-between-israeli-saudi-arabian-officials-report/) between
Saudi and Israeli officials in Egypt.

Sisi, who has been invited to participate in the upcoming Saudi summit
in the port city of Jeddah with Biden, has reaffirmed Egypt's commitment
to Gulf security calling it
an [extension](https://egyptindependent.com/egypts-sisi-security-of-gulf-countries-is-extension-to-egyptian-national-security/) of
Egypt's national security. He has also expressed his
"[rejection](https://castle-journal.com/index.php/politics/2747-sisi-stresses-egypt-s-consistent-attitude-towards-gulf-security-and-rejects-any-practices-that-seek-to-destabilize-and-stabilize-it) of
any practices that seek to destabilize the Gulf region." Sisi's remarks
came during the June 21 visit by MBS to Egypt.

[**There has been [talk of a push by]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark}

the lines of NATO]{.mark}** which would include Arab
states]{.underline}, Israel and the Gulf to counter the Iranian threat.
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz
has [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gantz-israel-is-building-a-middle-east-air-defense-alliance-against-iran/) hinted
at creating a US-led Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD) that would
defend member states from hostile missiles and drones. The idea appears
to be gaining ground in light of Iran's intransigence in the Doha talks.

[[With tensions running high]{.mark} in the region, [an escalation
against Iran]{.mark} at this time can [only exacerbate the
situation]{.mark}, further widening
the [rift](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-iran-gulf-states-idUSKCN0UP1TL20160111) between
Iran and its adversaries in the region]{.underline}. Perhaps sensing the
danger of a looming war, Iran appears to have backtracked on its earlier
demand for the easing of US sanctions in return for nuclear concessions:
it now insists that a revived nuclear deal with the US 
is [possible](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220630-iran-says-nuclear-deal-still-possible-despite-qatar-talks-setback).

"We are determined to continue negotiating until a realistic agreement
is reached," Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on
July 4 after the Doha talks stalled.

[**Resorting to military means when there is even the slimmest chance
for diplomacy** would be a serious blunder and can only plunge the
already-troubled region into further conflict]{.underline}. A military
campaign against Iran would have grave implications for all involved.
The US shouldn't repeat the past mistake of its
2003 [invasion](https://origins.osu.edu/milestones/march-2013-us-invasion-iraq-10-years-later?language_content_entity=en) of
Iraq which came after a nod of approval from some of its Middle Eastern
allies. Not only did the Iraq
war [cost](https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2020/02/06/the-iraq-war-has-cost-the-us-nearly-2-trillion/) the
US nearly \$2 trillion, it
also [killed](https://www.reuters.com/article/iraq-war-anniversary-idUSL1N0C65YD20130314) at
least 134,000 Iraqi civilians. Meanwhile, over 4,200 US military
personnel [lost](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20446496/) their lives
in the first 6.5 years of Operation Iraq Freedom and left Iraq marred by
terror and conflict.

[[An all-out military campaign]{.mark} against Iran isn't the solution
as it is unlikely to dissuade Iran from pursuing its nuclear ambitions;
if anything, **it would [escalate tensions further and plunge
the]{.mark} already-troubled [region into deeper
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. War or no war, the Islamic Republic
will likely continue to be a security challenge to the interests of the
US and its regional allies. 

[Covert military actions are already taking place, according to media
reports. Since May, at least seven Iranian officials and scientists have
been killed in what are
likely targeted [assassinations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/01/iran-israel-assassinations-covert-warfare-irgc/) by
Israel meant to weaken Iran's nuclear program]{.underline}. Iran has
downplayed the assassinations, accusing Israel of only one of the
killings---the May 22 slaying of Colonel Sayyad Khodai, a senior
official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Nearly all the
Iranians killed in recent months were either linked to Iran's nuclear
facilities or military infrastructure supporting Iran's proxies.

Attempts by Iran to retaliate for Khodai's killing have failed---so far.
According to now-former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Israel
and Turkey have thwarted several attempts by Iran-backed terrorists to
attack Israeli tourists visiting Turkey. The suspects
were [arrested](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2022/06/20/Israel-PM-says-thwarted-Iranian-attacks-in-Turkey-suspects-arrested),
but Israel has warned its citizens against visiting Turkey for fear of
retaliatory attacks by Iran.

As a result of Israel's covert military actions in Iran, it has
compromised the safety and security of its citizens abroad. In war,
there are no guarantees for safety and innocent citizens often pay the
price.

**[[Mines Are a Consistent Threat to U.S. Naval
Power]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[For centuries, mines have been utilized by navies to defend and project
power.]{.underline} While defensive mines can deter invading forces from
moving into certain waters, offensive mines can cause psychological
impacts. Mines are difficult to locate without professional equipment,
making their dispersal in bodies of water very risky. Since 1907,
international law has instructed governments to publicly disclose mined
areas. However, by World War II, many navies acquired
the [capability](https://www.propublica.org/article/iran-has-hundreds-of-naval-mines-us-navy-minesweepers-find-old-dishwashers-car-parts) to
drop mines by aircraft over enemy harbors. Prior to the innovation of
more advanced mines, the contact variant represented the only mine in
use. In order for a contact mine to detonate, it has to be physically
touched by a target. [As new mine variants and new military capabilities
emerged in the first half of the last century, **this [weapon]{.mark}
[became]{.mark} one of the [U.S. Navy's worst
nightmares]{.mark}**. ]{.underline}

Throughout the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, the Islamic
Republic
of [Iran](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/07/the-west-must-isolate-iran/) mined
several areas of the Persian Gulf and nearby waters. Its navy primarily
used variants of the 1908 Russian-designed contact mine, which was
ultimately responsible for the sinking of the [USS Samuel B.
Roberts](https://news.usni.org/2015/05/22/the-day-frigate-samuel-b-roberts-was-mined) (FFG058)
in 1988. [According to the [U.S. Naval
Institute](https://news.usni.org/2012/07/17/iranian-mines-strait-hormuz-not-showstoppers),
**[Iraq]{.mark} also [indiscriminately deployed over 1,000 mines]{.mark}
in the northern Gulf during this period of conflict**:]{.underline}

"In the early morning of 18 February 1991, the USS Tripoli (LPH-10),
which had embarked airborne mine-countermeasure helicopters, struck an
Iraqi contact mine; four hours later, the Aegis cruiser Princeton
(CG-59) fell victim to a Manta mine, a 'mission-kill' that took the
cruiser out of the war and cost about \$100 million to bring her back on
line. More to the point of the impact of a possible Iranian mining
campaign in 2012, it took the Multinational Coalition forces more than
two years of intensive mine-countermeasure operations to declare the
northern Gulf mine free."

[**The U.S. Navy's [history]{.mark} with naval mines [makes clear how
they threaten]{.mark} its [warships]{.mark}**. Perhaps, for this reason,
**[Iran]{.mark} has [used]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} of mines [to

[According to [Breaking

Guard Corps." [Additionally, "According to a January report by the UN

**[Adv\-\--NATO key]{.underline}**

**US investment is key to fulfill NATO framework**

Andrea **Daolio 19**, Andrea Daolio, from Italy, has an engineering
background and a longstanding passion for wargaming and for
geopolitical, historical, and military topic, 10/21/19, "Meeting the
Mine Warfare Challenge with Unmanned Systems," CIMSEC,
https://cimsec.org/meeting-the-mine-warfare-challenge-with-unmanned-systems/

Mines can be put in place by aircraft, surface ships, pleasure boats,
submarines, and combat divers and even from pickup trucks crossing
bridges. They can be found from the surf zone to deep water (greater
than 200 feet) and can be of many different and increasingly capable
types. These range from simple contact mines to more complex magnetic,
acoustic or pressure mines; from advanced mines that are a combination
of the preceding types to computerized mines that can be even set to be
detonated only by some specific ship type.

Mines are increasingly difficult to detect. The underwater environment
is already a difficult medium to search through, as the currents,
differences in salinity and temperature, and seafloor clutter (which is
often littered with a vast array of debris) impede search. Meanwhile,
mines are becoming even more elusive as stealthy mines made of
fiberglass can be extremely difficult to detect. Furthermore, modern
sonars are hardly capable enough to find advanced types of mines buried
under the seafloor.

[**[Machine learning and algorithms]{.mark} can also [improve]{.mark}
the [ability of a UUV to recognize mines]{.mark} and identify objects on
the seafloor. The [NATO]{.mark}** Science and Technology Organisation,
 Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (**[STO
CMRE]{.mark}**) of LaSpezia (Italy) has recently [developed]{.mark} an
advanced [algorithm]{.mark} that will **[automate]{.mark} the
time-consuming task of [mine identification]{.mark} and disposal [and
further advances]{.mark} in this field [will greatly improve MCM]{.mark}
operations**]{.underline}.8 Moreover, adding an advanced lightweight
hydrophone array to UUVs will improve the capability to detect and
localize underwater objects (and will give the UUV an improved secondary
ASW capability).9

Likewise, unmanned systems can greatly help MCM operations in the air
and on the surface. The experience gathered by DARPA with the ASW
Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) could be used to create an
advanced and completely autonomous MCM ship. Using powerful sensors,
advanced automation software and MCM gear, an MCM ACTUV will be able to
take many of the tasks now given to the Avenger-class minesweepers. A
fully autonomous large fleet of inexpensive unmanned UUVs and USVs could
sweep large portions of the sea while avoiding all risk to sailors.

While ships, USVs, and UUVs are the best platforms to neutralize mines,
airplanes and helicopters are the fastest platforms to sweep the sea.
The laser-based ALMDS (Airborne Laser Mine Detection System) and the
unmanned COBRA (Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis System)
have recently entered service, but more systems can be deployed in the
future.10 [**[UAVs are the perfect choice for persistent
reconnaissance]{.mark}** and can be adapted for the MCM task and
augmented to field the COBRA and ALMDS systems.]{.underline}

[**While [the Navy]{.mark} arguably [gives less attention to mine
countermeasures than it deserves]{.mark}, it gives even lesser attention
to its own offensive mining capability**. [If]{.mark} the [U.S. Navy
wants to maintain]{.mark} a solid [deterrent]{.mark} against rivals then
it [should improve]{.mark} and expand its own [mine
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The new Hammerhead mine and the
Clandestine Delivered Mine (CDM) are a good step in the right direction
and more should follow.11 **But the vast majority of U.S. mines are
Quickstrike mines converted from general-purpose bombs.**]{.underline}
Dedicated bottom and buried advanced mines (similar to the advanced
British Stonefish mine) should be developed and the number of platforms
able to deploy mines should be expanded to include UAVs, USVs, and UUVs.
Moreover, air-launched mines should get extended-range winged kits
similar to those employed by the HAAWC High Altitude ASW Weapons Concept
torpedo to give launching aircraft the ability to deploy the mine much
further away from enemy positions.12

[Until recently the task of minesweeping has been extremely dangerous
for sailors, but with new technologies such as unmanned systems and
machine learning, **[it is time to invest heavily in these avenues of
capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} and convert a greater part of the U.S.
Navy to fully autonomous and unmanned MCM operations.

The importance of mine warfare and of mine countermeasures for any
modern Navy can never be stressed enough. [Given how mining can achieve
great results and inflict huge losses with relatively low risk and cost
argues for greater investment in these weapons and the means to counter
them.]{.underline}

**Greater [intel sharing]{.underline} and [collaboration]{.underline}
required for AUVs; NATO's already got a head-start but doesn't solve**

[**[AUVs]{.mark} themselves are [relatively easy to operate]{.mark},
monitor and control, [but to communicate]{.mark}** in the depths of the
underwater environment, above sea [tech]{.mark}nologies like radio and
video are **[rendered useless]{.mark} after just some
metres**]{.underline}. This puts innovation now firmly in the hands of
technologists and physicists to deliver technology solutions involving
light and sound, which are still in furious development to take
communications to the next level, with security being the number one
priority.

[To put this into perspective, **we should look at the application uses
for subsea technology**]{.underline}. On a single mission, RN AUVs may
need to be out of sight for many hours, sometimes even days. Its
operators want to know that everything is working optimally, and they
will be relying on continuous monitoring and regular status updates.
[While an AUV is on a survey, the Navy may wish to assign it a task
during this exploratory mission]{.underline}, such as to take pictures
of a contact or location and, for this reason, communication to the AUV
is of key importance. There are a broad range of underwater assets, from
large submarine platforms to very low power autonomous sensors sitting
on the seabed. [The [challenge is that there is a larger range of
requirements]{.mark} and drivers in terms of what those various assets
can do, [what sensors they have and how they
communicate]{.mark}]{.underline}. They cannot all physically communicate
as they cannot always operate in the same frequency. So how do you get
all these disparate naval systems to talk to each other?

[**[NATO's JANUS communications system]{.mark}**, created in 2017 by its
Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), **[was a great
start, but the jury is still out in terms of its broader role]{.mark}**
as a tactical acoustic communication solution]{.underline}, due to
moderate data rate, lack of underpinning transmission security (TRANSEC)
layer, and relatively large overheads associated with JANUS protocols,
meaning platforms transmit more energy in the water which collectively
elevates counter detection and information exploitation risk. The
potential adoption of JANUS as a 'first contact' handshake protocol,
capable of supporting subsequent hand-off to nation-specific waveforms
and protocols is a likely direction of travel. This is to balance basic
multi-nation interoperability needs, against broader, nation-specific
tactical communication needs. [**[The use of JANUS,]{.mark} of course
[does not preclude the sharing of sovereign waveforms between allies and
partners]{.mark}**, as these are developed and proven over
time.]{.underline}

**[Even though [IUU]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Illegal, Unregulated, and

security [threats]{.mark}, the [present]{.mark} [juncture]{.mark}
[presents]{.mark} a [gloomy picture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current
maritime security mechanism is beleaguered with non-traditional threats.
[Moreover, the growing unprincipled actions and coercive tactics in the
waters of the Indian Ocean adversely affect the security apparatus of
the region]{.underline}.

With stiff competition to assert influence, the strategic arena of the
region has undergone a massive change and has resulted in severe
economic, security, and environmental consequences. [**[China's]{.mark}
[transition]{.mark} to a supreme power [reflects]{.mark} its [sheer
disregard]{.mark} for international rules** and concerns for the region.
Moreover, its illegal fishing activities exacerbate the depletion of
crucial fisheries, which satiates Beijing's hunger for global power and
rejuvenation.]{.underline}

[**[The lack of effective ocean governance is evident from]{.mark} the
severe [security environment]{.mark}** of the region]{.underline}.
Rampant IUU fishing activities defy international laws and intensify the
insecurity in national and international waters. Besides, the Regional
Fishery Management Organisations (RFMO) inadequacy has become an
essential geopolitical matter. The organisational gaps of the global and
regional organisations have failed to lessen the strains on the fish
stocks of the Indian Ocean.

Navigating the Waters

[The Indian Ocean, the host of some of the essential fisheries globally,
accounts for over [14
percent](https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/chinese-trawlers-on-the-prowl-in-the-indian-ocean-iuu-pose-the-greatest-maritime-threat/2145847/) of
the global wild-caught fish]{.underline}. According to the Information
Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) reports, there have
been [379 and 213
incidents](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/chinas-illegal-unregulated-fishing-in-indian-ocean-poses-challenges-452343) of
IUU fishing in IOR in 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively.

[As per
a [report](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/environment-sustainability/new-wwf-report-finds-unregulated-fishing-escalating-in-indian-ocean) by
WWF, the unregulated part of IUU fishing is often sidelined. [Regulatory
gaps](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/environment-sustainability/new-wwf-report-finds-unregulated-fishing-escalating-in-indian-ocean) in
the high seas of the Indian Ocean are based on both geographical
location and species]{.underline} (Chase, 2020). The absence of any
squid-monitoring organisation leads to [unregulated squid
fishing](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/chinese-boats-illegally-hauling-tuna-indian-ocean-1885751-2021-12-09) in
the Indian Ocean. [Trygg Mat
Tracking](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/chinese-boats-illegally-hauling-tuna-indian-ocean-1885751-2021-12-09) found
that squid vessels have multiplied six-fold since 2016. Moreover, the
use of large nets by such vessels leads to the [by-fishing of
non-targeted
species](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/chinese-boats-illegally-hauling-tuna-indian-ocean-1885751-2021-12-09),
especially tuna. The Indian Ocean's yellowfin tuna, the world's [most
profitable
fisheries](https://india.mongabay.com/2021/04/predatory-european-ships-push-indian-ocean-tuna-to-the-brink/),
is the most threatened species. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)
has alarmed the concerning levels of the species.

[**[IUU]{.mark} [fishing]{.mark} [activities]{.mark} [push]{.mark}
the [security of the international waters to a]{.mark} downright
[critical]{.mark} [level]{.mark}**. [Illegal
activities](https://www.cfr.org/article/illegal-fishing-global-threat-heres-how-combat-it) like
human trafficking and smuggling of drugs and arms in fishing vessels
undermine international ocean governance authority]{.underline}.
**[Also, [illegal fishing jeopardises port security]{.mark} as many
local fishers are forced to turn
to [piracy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48531463). Often this [serves
as a facilitator of terror financing]{.mark} and nurtures [maritime
terrorism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48531463).]{.underline}**

[Besides, unreported fishing has severe environmental
ramifications]{.underline}. Trawlers use large nets, which results in
the [by-catching](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-014-9228-6) of
species like sea birds, turtles, sea mammals, sharks and killer whales.
Moreover, the use of [illegal gillnets and
explosives](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-014-9228-6) by
some vessels to keep whales away from fishing lines pollutes the
sea-based and impacts the growth of young fishes.

[Excessive and unreported fishing creates ecological imbalances by
disrupting the critical food chains]{.underline}. Seafood remains a
crucial source of protein for humans globally, and the current polluted
environment makes many species unfit for consumption. In addition, the
high demand for seafood globally has created a shortage of some species.
[Consequently, many poorer nations suffer from food insecurity in
disrupted supply chains and ceased employment opportunities for local
anglers.]{.underline}

The consequential economic woes for the fisheries-dependent littoral
states are enormous as it drives millions of small-scale fisheries and
fishers out of work. In addition, smaller states that depend on their
territorial waters' fisheries get smacked by larger countries both from
within the IOR and outside. As a result, it [negatively
impacts](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-014-9228-6) the
Gross National Products and lowers the value of legal fish stocks in the
market. Moreover, the [loss of
revenue](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-014-9228-6) affects
ports and vessel maintenance, exerting pressures on the national budgets
of these economies.

Besides, the prevalence of predatory behaviour of developed countries,
moving tactically in the geopolitical power game, has subverted and
suppressed the concerns alarmed by poorer littoral states. This leads to
exploitation of the rights of under-developed coastal regions which
depend on fisheries export for survival. Moreover, private companies
continue to fish unregulated amounts of stocks while threatening the
livelihood of small fishing companies.

Let's catch the big fish   

[In recent years, the key actors in maritime geopolitics have altered.
The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has been beleaguered by the presence of
foreign and non-state actors and intense competition for
power]{.underline}. One particularly noticeable actor is China which has
strengthened its standing in the ocean through various infrastructural
and economic projects.

[China's increasing footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR)
postulates a risk of growing port insecurity of the littoral states.
Beijing is a signatory of the UNCLOS]{.underline} (United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea); [nevertheless, Chinese boats and
research vessels illegally transgress in various [Exclusive Economic
Zones](https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/chinese-trawlers-on-the-prowl-in-the-indian-ocean-iuu-pose-the-greatest-maritime-threat/2145847/) in
the Indian Ocean and worldwide]{.underline}. In addition, the Indian
Navy has also reported illegal deployments of the People's Liberation
Army's (PLA) research vessels for [deep-sea mining and
ISR](https://raisinahouse.org/indo-pacific-vision/f/india-china-power-play-in-the-indian-ocean) (Intelligence,
Surveillance & Reconnaissance) activities that threaten the maritime
security of the region.

[In addition to piracy and "intelligence" activities, **[China's blatant
exploitation of fisheries is]{.mark} [apparent]{.mark} from its gigantic
share in world overseas fishing vessels**]{.underline}.
Beijing's Distant Water Fleet (DWF) has around 17,000 fishing vessels
registered in China, while close to [1,000
vessels](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/chinas-illegal-unregulated-fishing-in-indian-ocean-poses-challenges-452343) are
lodged under various flags of convenience, as per satellite data. On the
other hand, the European Union and the USA have only[ 289 and 225
registered
vessels](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/chinas-illegal-unregulated-fishing-in-indian-ocean-poses-challenges-452343),
respectively. [The **anticipated figure for China is much higher [due to
its many unregistered vessels]{.mark}** tagged as [ghost
ships](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/chinas-illegal-unregulated-fishing-in-indian-ocean-poses-challenges-452343).]{.underline}

The [Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing
Index](https://iuufishingindex.net/ranking) shows China in the top place
globally for 2019 and 2021. The country operates the largest [fleet of
trawlers](https://diplomatist.com/2022/06/09/lets-catch-the-big-fish/#chinas-illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing) globally,
which the government heavily subsidised, incentivising the operators to
plunge into foreign waters. Moreover, these often serve as [surrogates
of the
PLA](https://diplomatist.com/2022/06/09/lets-catch-the-big-fish/#chinas-illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing) and
indulge in surveillance and foreign intelligence activities.

[China's marine transgressions particularly mire the Western Indian
Ocean. With depleting resources in the South and East China Seas,
Chinese fishing vessels make regular illegal incursions to the [eastern
coastline of
Africa](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/chinas-illegal-unregulated-fishing-in-indian-ocean-poses-challenges-452343)]{.underline}.
Additionally, as per reports, Chinese boats with a history of pursuing
illicit activities have potentially intruded in the [EEZ of
Oman](https://www.statecraft.co.in/article/chinese-boats-illegally-fishing-in-northwest-indian-ocean-report) and
Yemen. The sheer exploitation of the waters of Madagascar and Somalia is
evident as recently, many [Chinese backed
firms](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/08/china-joins-the-foreign-fleets-quietly-exploiting-madagascars-waters/) have
fished ashore in these countries.

[**[Beijing]{.mark} has been [heavily involved in [unregulated squid
fishing](https://www.statecraft.co.in/article/chinese-boats-illegally-fishing-in-northwest-indian-ocean-report)]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}**,
which contradicts the statements by the Chinese government to limit high
seas squid fishing]{.underline}. In addition, China illegally hauls
massive amounts of tuna as
a [by-catch](https://www.statecraft.co.in/article/chinese-boats-illegally-fishing-in-northwest-indian-ocean-report) of
squid fishing.

[**Furthermore, [while the ]{.mark}European Union
([EU)]{.mark} theoretically [has a comprehensive strategy]{.mark} and
policy to counter IUU fishing, [it exploits distant waters for
tuna]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} [Overfishing yellowfin
tuna](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/05/eu-accused-of-neocolonial-plundering-of-tuna-in-indian-ocean) in

being hypocritical]{.mark} and accused by the coastal states of its
neo-colonial behaviour]{.underline}. [EU members France and Spain
fished [70,000
tonnes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/05/eu-accused-of-neocolonial-plundering-of-tuna-in-indian-ocean) of
yellowfin in 2019, which exceeds any resident state's
numbers]{.underline}. With its [fish-aggregating
devices](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/05/eu-accused-of-neocolonial-plundering-of-tuna-in-indian-ocean) (FADs),
EU ships seamlessly capture massive proportions, overshadowing the local
fishing groups and leaving small IOR nations dry. As a result, the
population of tuna in the Indian Ocean, specifically yellowfin, is
feared to be on the verge of collapse.

The Way Ahead

As fisheries in the IOR continue to languish, creating international and
regional synergies to advocate sustainable fishing is imperative. While
many countries in the region have formed and implemented national
strategies to safeguard their interests, the trends are evidence of
continued high unregulated levels of fishing in the Indian Ocean.
Moreover, existing regulations and monitoring by international
organisations have only gained a low to moderate success as these are
often associated with corruption and lousy management.

**[[A credible]{.mark} and effective [Ocean Governance is the best
solution to combat]{.mark} [this]{.mark} grave maritime [threat]{.mark}.
The [IORA]{.mark} [needs]{.mark} to forge [partnerships]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [various existing]{.mark} and upcoming
[multilateral]{.mark} [circles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [A global
approach is crucial to unifying forces against this marine
menace.]{.underline} Organisations like IOTC, Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), and International Maritime Organisation (IMO) need
to transform their governing principles to work effectively and
independently from the greater power competition.

[As the global geopolitical canvas is constantly altering, the nuances
of maritime diplomacy and cooperation have come a long way. Multilateral
diplomacy efforts to hold rule-flouting states accountable are the need
of the hour]{.underline}. Inclusive solutions and result-oriented
actions can turn this climate calamity around based on the essence of
reformed multilateralism, which reflects contemporary reality.
Strengthening regional multilateral fora like the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Bay of Bengal
Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation
(BIMSTEC) can effectively safeguard their EEZs from foreign fishing
fleets and regulate the fishing of endangered species in their national
waters. Through a collaboration with the IOTC, such organisations should
indulge in information and intelligence sharing to protect the species
in familiar waters from overfishing.

The required course of action for the IORA is to revamp its fisheries
management strategy and sustainable fishing endeavours. It is necessary
to align the fisheries policies of the IORA member states and stricter
countermeasures against IUU fishing and put in collective efforts. IORA
needs to address the regulatory gaps in its management of fisheries.
Maritime strategists stress the need for accountability and better law
enforcement of anti-IUU fishing laws. The global fishing industry must
be put through more strict regulations and should be penalised to ensure
proper enforcement. Developed nations like China, Russia and European
countries need to be assigned liabilities for such illegal activities
and suffer the economic consequences.

Additionally, IORA needs to identify extremely sensitive areas and
sanction more marine protected zones. Finally, by joining forces with
various non-governmental and research organisations, the association
should finance more research and development projects to help member
states build capacity.

[[With the **advent of a**]{.mark}**rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence and
the advancement of technology**, [IORA]{.mark} [needs to deploy]{.mark}
**more [resources to create functional intel]{.mark}ligence
[mechanisms]{.mark}**. Increased investment in marine domain awareness
to maintain accurate data on fisheries and monitor the illegal
activities of unregistered fishing vessels. **Technological
[cooperation]{.mark} [can prevent IUU fishing and]{.mark} broadly ensure
economic stability and [secure high seas]{.mark}. Further, marine
[experts]{.mark} [suggest]{.mark} that [IOTC should expand its scope
in [high-tech vessel
tracking](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2019/06/12/better-vessel-tracking-would-help-fight-illegal-fishing-in-indian-ocean)]{.mark}.**
The existing [Vessel Monitoring
Systems](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2019/06/12/better-vessel-tracking-would-help-fight-illegal-fishing-in-indian-ocean) (VMS)
require high coverage and consistency in tracking and data sharing
across member states.]{.underline}

Oceans are an indispensable part of the ecosystem, and the protection of
marine biodiversity is our responsibility. [**[The fight against IUU
fishing will lead to a domino effect to eliminate maritime]{.mark}
[insecurity]{.mark}, [piracy]{.mark}, [and terrorism]{.mark}** and
create an economically safer and more secure environment for the coastal
states and the world as a whole]{.underline}. Hence, a reliable and
sustainable solution by each stakeholder is essential.

<https://www.hstoday.us/channels/federal-state-local/the-nexus-of-organized-crime-wmd/>

One of the [**biggest [concern]{.mark}s** we have [with]{.mark} regard
to **international criminal [organizations]{.mark}** and their
activities [is]{.mark} their **affiliation and [collaboration]{.mark}**
[with **terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[nexus]{.underline}]{.mark} between international criminal
organizations and terrorists has [[resulted in]{.mark} the use of
well-established **[smuggling]{.mark} networks** that were created for
criminal activities now also being used by terrorists for]{.underline}
potentially, in particular and of particular concern to the alliance,
the [[**transportation** of **w**]{.mark}eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass
**[d]{.mark}**estruction [and materials]{.mark} that could be
[used]{.mark} by terrorists [for **attacking**]{.mark} **our
[cities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and our populations. This is something
that we continue to be worried about and continue to work with other
international organizations to try to prevent.

Speak about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and what's
being done to mitigate this threat.

The **[greatest [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the alliance [[is a
**terror**]{.mark}**ist group [with a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon** and
exploding that weapon]{.underline} in one of our cities. We've said that
[this is the **greatest threat** and we continue to worry about those
criminal organizations that would facilitate this]{.underline} actually
happening.

So, we have looked at, number one, our intelligence and information
sharing with partner nations and other international organizations in
order to help foster a common understanding of potential WMD
proliferation trends and threats by terrorist groups, including the
identification of proliferation trafficking networks, financing
mechanisms and a potential adversary's WMD capabilities and intentions.

Obviously, the role of intelligence is key in identifying and assessing
these potential threats as well as our vulnerabilities. The other area,
of course, is developing the capabilities to defend against and, if
necessary, respond to these threats by having the capability to
interdict the illicit trafficking of these materials. Again, this
involves working very closely with other international organizations,
such as INTERPOL and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
regional law enforcement organizations, and our nations' own law
enforcement and defense organizations.

Speak for a moment on what geographic areas are concerning, are they
expanding, how are they being monitored, and where is the greatest
threat?

What's interesting about what we see happening is that terrorist groups
and international criminal organizations are utilizing long-standing
smuggling routes to try to transport these materials to NATO countries.
One of the areas we're very concerned about is, for example, central
Asia where a number of the countries in the former Soviet Union still
have [thousands of **[radioactive sources]{.mark}**, which]{.underline}
were originally used for a variety of legitimate purposes, but are now
[[are]{.mark} totally **[unsafe]{.mark}-guarded**]{.underline}.

[They're not protected, they're not secure, [and]{.mark} they
**[could]{.mark} easily [be]{.mark}** [harvested by
**criminals**]{.mark}]{.underline} or terrorist groups. [They could then
be smuggled out of these countries and subsequently shaped into a
weapon]{.underline} or put into a weapon-a radiological weapon for
example--and detonated in one of our countries. Over the last 20 years
the IAEA has tracked thousands of attempts at trafficking and selling
these materials. So, the smuggling routes of particular concern are
those through the Caspian Sea region, on into the Black Sea area, and
then into the Balkans and up into Western Europe.

begin the third major phase of the future submarine nuclear deterrent
programme -- Dreadnought.

[With the overall programme supporting around 30,000 jobs across the UK,
from design through to build, Delivery Phase 3 (DP3) represents the most
significant stage of the Dreadnought programme]{.underline} so far. In
2021 alone, it supported around 13,500 jobs in the Northwest of England
and a further 16,300 over the rest of the UK, making a significant
contribution to the Government's levelling-up agenda.

[**The [investment is the latest financial commitment]{.mark}** between
the Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, and is the initial
investment within a planned [overall total of nearly £10

DP3 will see the first of four submarines, HMS Dreadnought, exit the
Barrow-in-Furness shipyard to begin sea trials, laying the foundation to
sustain the Continuous at Sea Deterrence (CASD) for as long as the
international security situation makes it necessary.

[**The [Dreadnought programme also brings huge benefits to the BAE

require the United States to take a hard and clear look at the eroding
deterrent value of its conventional forces---not only in Europe, but
around the world. As the Biden administration prepares to release
its National Defense Strategy, nuclear posture review and missile
defense review, along with a delayed budget request for fiscal year
2023, the White House must acknowledge that we are at a turning point in
world history. [Our adversaries have unequivocally demonstrated their
willingness to violate the territorial integrity of another state.
**[We]{.mark} [must ensure our allies]{.mark} and partners**
[know]{.mark} [U.S. promises]{.mark} are ironclad---the United States

[[Investments]{.mark} in national defense [must reflect]{.mark} a sober
[commitment to uphold U.S international obligations, counter]{.mark}
malign [efforts of our opponents]{.mark}, and secure a safer world for
future generations]{.underline}. As the United States shores up the
strength of the U.S. military for a degrading security environment,
Congress is uniquely charged under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S.
Constitution to "provide and maintain a Navy." In this new era, our
ability to project power across and under the seas must be unquestioned.
The U.S. cannot afford fuzzy and ever-shifting naval shipbuilding plans
that suffer during execution. The defense budget request for FY23 must
be accompanied by a future years defense program and a 30-year
shipbuilding plan that demonstrate a simultaneously ambitious---and
realistic---approach to maintaining the primacy of U.S. naval forces.

**[[Congress]{.mark} [has not received a]{.mark} true 30-year
[shipbuilding plan from the D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense [in]{.mark} two [years]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
December 2020, the Trump administration released what was termed [Battle
Force
2045](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/10/2002549918/-1/-1/1/SHIPBUILDING%20PLAN%20DEC%2020_NAVY_OSD_OMB_FINAL.PDF),
more formally known as the Report to Congress on the Long-Range Plan for
Construction of Naval Vessels.  The plan was notable for two reasons.
First, it broke with the findings of the Navy's 2016 force structure
assessment that advised building a future fleet of 355 battle force
ships. Instead, Battle Force 2045 set a goal of 403 battle force ships
by FY45, and was estimated by the [Congressional Budget Office to cost
a [little more than \$1.0 trillion in 2021 dollars over 30
years](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-04/57091-Shipbuilding.pdf%22%20%5Cl%20%22page=6)]{.underline}.
Second, the plan was released as President Trump left office, so the
Biden administration was free to make changes. Yet, [the Navy's
subsequent [shipbuilding plan for
FY22](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/17/2002744915/-1/-1/0/PB22%20SHIPBUILDING%20PLAN%20JUNE%202021_FINAL.PDF) protested
that studies were ongoing, failed to provide a 30-year plan, and instead
proposed potential ranges of between 321 and 372 total battle force
ships---not including unmanned vessels]{.underline}. As neither plan has
proven durable---or adequate in the case of the FY22 document---the
Navy's true goals remain unclear.   

[**It is difficult to overstate the [ramifications]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[DoD's blatant willingness to shirk]{.mark} this
[responsibility]{.mark}. [Congress]{.mark} is [forced]{.mark} [to
make]{.mark} funding [decisions]{.mark} for the Navy and Marine Corps
[with incomplete info]{.mark}rmation** about how the Sea Services intend
to meet the challenges of their future operating
environments.]{.underline} America's shipbuilding defense industrial
base and its workforce---including welders, engineers, pipefitters, and
many others---are plunged into years of uncertainty[**[. Our allies and
partners are left to draw their own conclusions]{.mark}** about our
commitment to addressing shared strategic concerns.]{.underline} Navy
Secretary Carlos Del Toro's [belief that Congress is amenable to ranges
of
ships](https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2022/03/navys-new-30-year-shipbuilding-plan-will-avoid-detailsagain/362988/) in
the 30-year shipbuilding plan is a fallacy and embraces the current
failure to define clear requirements. Last year's one-year "30-year"
shipbuilding submission proposed a range of ships that only pushes
Congress to race to the lowest common denominator and accept the bare
minimum number of ships. This pattern is untenable.      

[**Our adversaries do not suffer from any such lack of clarity.** DoD's
annual report to Congress---[Military and Security Developments
Involving the People's Republic of
China](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF)---laid
out the CCP's shipbuilding prowess in no uncertain terms]{.underline}.
While the United States debates how and if to build a fleet of 355
vessels, China has already secured that inventory, making the People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) the largest in the world. Further, per the
report, "the PLAN's overall battle force is expected to grow to 420
ships by 2025 and 460 ships by 2030," with fleet growth largely driven
by additional major surface combatants. [**[DoD]{.mark} estimates also
[suggest]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [develop]{.mark} a
ballistic missile [submarine]{.mark} [force]{.mark} capable of holding
the United States at risk**]{.underline} by 2030 with a mix of roughly
eight Type 094 and improved Type 096 nuclear-powered ballistic-missile
submarines.

[China's naval modernization poses a grave threat to the ability of the
U.S. Navy to secure control of blue-water ocean in the western Pacific
during a potential crisis. The window to tighten such disparities with
China is closing rapidly.]{.underline} Last year, the outgoing and
current commanders of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,  Admirals Philip
Davidson and John
Aquilino, [testified](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/21-14_03-23-2021.pdf) that
China could try to resolve its dispute with Taiwan using military force
by 2027. Admiral Davidson's assessment was sobering: "Taiwan is clearly
one of \[China's\] ambitions. . . . And I think the threat is manifest
during this decade, in fact in the next six years." Inescapably,
quantity has a quality of its own, and China has secured the lead.   

[The responses from the White House to date, however, reflect neither
urgency nor vision. In the absence of a real China strategy or National
Defense Strategy]{.underline}---and with no meaningful changes made in
the recent Global Posture Review---the Biden
administration's [Indo-Pacific
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf) references
security as an afterthought, with the fourth line of effort for the
region listed as "bolster\[ing\] Indo-Pacific security."  More broadly,
[the administration explained that [the]{.mark} "decisive
[decade]{.mark} before us will determine if the region can confront and
address climate change, reveal how the world rebuilds from a
once-in-a-century pandemic, **and [decide whether we can sustain]{.mark}
the principles of [openness, transparency, and inclusivity]{.mark} that
have fueled the region's success**]{.underline}." But these tenets miss
the most consequential and immediate threat facing the
Indo-Pacific---China's alarming military buildup and its threat to the
independence of Taiwan and freedom of the seas in the western Pacific.

As harbinger of tests to come, China consistently demonstrates its
willingness to violate Taiwan's sovereignty. In a span of just four days
this past October, [Taiwan
reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-says-needs-be-alert-chinas-military-activities-2021-10-05/) 148
Chinese planes had flown in its air defense identification zone (ADIZ).
And just one day after China's foreign ministry said that Taiwan is "not
Ukraine," nine Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwan's ADIZ. China is also
telegraphing its global ambitions beyond the Indo-Pacific via efforts
including the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Through the BRI,
China finances development projects in partner nations, but those
nations often become unavoidably indebted to China as a
result. [Djibouti, for example, is burdened by significant debt to
China](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-widens-presence-in-indian-ocean-through-massive-inroads-in-djibouti/articleshow/86676234.cms?from=mdr) as
a result of bilateral economic and infrastructural agreements,
and [provided China with its first overseas military base at the
entrance of the Red
Sea](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/17/2002894852/-1/-1/1/JIPA%20-%20SAXENA%20-%20AFRICA.PDF)---a
choke point for major international shipping lanes.

Fortunately, some U.S. defense leaders recognize the challenge despite
the clear, although unstated gap, between the White House and Defense
Department. Recently, [Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific
Affairs Ely
Ratner](https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings?ID=A4C3719C-F05F-497B-9BDF-8773CD27ABE1) explicitly
told Congress: "With China as the pacing challenge, Taiwan is the pacing
scenario, driven by a strategy of denial." With this supposed urgency of
planning should come seriousness of intent, tangible changes to posture,
notable increases in investment, imaginative shifts in concepts, and
finally, longer-term certainty for the U.S. Navy and its shipbuilding
industrial base in the form of clear and concrete ship-construction
plans.

[The United States can deliberate no longer; now is the time for action.
China is rapidly expanding its fleet]{.underline}; it has developed
long-range missiles to hold foundational components of U.S. strength,
including carrier strike groups and forward bases, at risk, increasing
the complexity of U.S. and allied security challenges in the region.
[The People's Liberation Army counts on continued American
indecisiveness. We must prove them wrong.]{.underline} Congress can
provide weight to the Biden administration's underwhelming Indo-Pacific
Strategy by turning words into actions. The aspirational fleet of Battle
Force 2045 should not be abandoned. [Concrete steps are required in the
short-term to shore up the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base for future
growth]{.underline}. The United States can achieve these goals by
investing rapidly to expand the capacity and capabilities of its naval
ships and facilities over the next five years and beyond to hold China's
navy at risk.    

[Renewed commitments to American sea power cannot come soon enough.
**[The Navy's current fleet]{.mark} of approximately 297 battle force
ships [does not match operational requirements]{.mark}**. Indeed, the
Navy maintains a forward presence of roughly 100 ships at
sea]{.underline}, resulting in an [operational tempo of roughly 28
percent,
or](https://www.heritage.org/military-strength/assessment-us-military-power/us-navy) "nearly
double the \[operational tempo\] that characterized the Cold War."
Requirements for forward naval presence will not abate as China's
assertiveness grows. Without substantial investments in more ships with
improved capabilities, the Navy will be strained further as more wear
and tear is placed on each hull. This equation is well known, and the
Navy has tried to grow its fleet since 2016 as a result. Recognition of
the problem and subsequent insufficient action, however, only makes
DoD's recent failures to deliver a workable plan to grow the fleet more
disappointing.

[More troubling still, **the Department of Defense continues to make
compounding decisions that do not reflect the urgency of the
challenges** facing the Navy today]{.underline}, or over the horizon.

Last year, the Navy requested just a single new Arleigh Burke--class
destroyer---brazenly demonstrating a willingness to violate its contract
obligations without action from Congress. It requested zero additional
amphibious ships and proposed the retirement of seven of our largest
surface combatants. The firepower of those seven ships alone exceeds
that of the entire Royal Navy. [While DoD proposed shrinking the fleet
and cutting the Navy's shipbuilding budget, China continues investing in
its surface and undersea forces.]{.underline}

[The U.S. Navy is focused on high-end warfare---engaging antiship cruise
missiles, defeating hypersonic weapons,]{.underline} protecting the
homeland and allies from ballistic missiles, and operating the air wing
far from shore in a command-and-control degraded environment. We are
focused on defeating those we sometimes still call "near-peer"
[competitors. Our fleet's muscle will not make it to the high-end fight,
though, if it fears the deceptively destructive naval mine. **Make no
mistake, though not flashy, mine warfare is relevant
today.**]{.underline} The U.S. Navy generally subscribes to the notion
that mines are used by lesser forces and are to be defeated by stronger
navies.\[1\] History shows us otherwise, though. How do we combat mines
in a 21st-century Navy? The answer does not require reinventing the
wheel. The Fleet-tested platforms, complete with resident knowledge on
board, exist. [The answer involves following a path the Navy has been
down before---updating and improving upon a legacy platform and
reintroducing it to the fleet]{.underline}. Surface-borne mine
countermeasures deserves its fair share of attention---from the service,
from the surface community, and from resource sponsors. [The Navy should
make what is old, new again---build and deploy a
21st-century Avenger.]{.underline}

Mines are inexpensive. They present a fiscally efficient option to foes
with a substantial return on investment. They are easy to deploy and are
difficult to combat. They are stealthy and disrupt the world's sea lanes
and are built to guarantee a mission kill. Just the threat of their use
or the rumor of their presence has immediate tactical and strategic
impact, whether it be merchants avoiding chokepoints or harbors, causing
untold damage to the economy, or billion-dollar naval vessels held at
arm's length, allowing belligerents to buy time and achieve objectives.
The challenges posed by deterring, [[detecting]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[defeating]{.mark} them make their [threat]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [U.S.
Navy worthy of]{.mark} a serious [reinvestment]{.mark} in time and
resources.]{.underline}

[**The [Avenger-class minesweeper]{.mark}, the U.S. Navy's only
surface-borne mine countermeasures asset, [is more than 25 years-old and
past its prime]{.mark}**. The state of the Navy's minesweeper fleet is
notorious, primarily [stemming]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [critical]{.mark}
parts [shortages]{.mark} and a shore establishment focused on other
priorities, [ill-postured to support the aging]{.mark} and unique
[equipment]{.mark} on board these wooden ships]{.underline}. They often
are unable to get underway for myriad material and equipment issues, and
are not, in the opinion of some, ready to meet the operational mission
for which they are designed and deployed---both in numbers and
readiness. [**The fight [to keep equipment running]{.mark} on board the
ship [and supplies flowing]{.mark} outside the lifelines [is like
flailing in quicksand]{.mark}**. The parts are often out of stock or
obsolete]{.underline}. The companies that made them are out of business
or have moved to other production. The warehouse shelves regularly leave
the ships wanting. And the parts that do exist were, in many cases, not
built to work in today's threat environment or amongst modern standards.
None of these gripes---not one--are an indictment of the platform or its
sailors, nor the valiant shore establishment that works to keep them
running. The Avenger-class minesweeper---capable of
minesweeping and mine hunting---is a good ship and it is the right one
for the job. We do not need a new, untested platform. We need updated
and upgraded versions of this proud class of ships in the fleet,
forward-deployed and ready to fight tonight.

In this day of advanced systems and weaponry---in a fleet dominated by
Aegis---and with the rising specter of nuclear weapons-armed
adversaries, why must we bother with building, fostering, and caring for
a robust mine countermeasures capability? It seems logical to place our
focus elsewhere. That said, [**the edge our well-funded priorities are
supposed to give us will be dulled if those high-end assets cannot get
to the fight**. One also must consider that the Navy's mandate is not
simply to defeat enemies, but to keep open and free the world's sea
lanes of communication.]{.underline} It may seem far-fetched, but
enemies with mines have the potential to severely bog down U.S. forces
and could, in theory, cause a level of damage deemed unacceptable by
leaders, government, and the American people. Belligerents with naval
mines have the ability to shape the battlespace in their own vision---we
must preserve our own capability to rip the seaways back from them, kick
in their door, and allow a stacked-up Fleet to follow in the
minesweeper's wake with peace of mind and certainty of victory.\[2\]

Still asking: "why?" Because, [while more than 50 countries boast a
naval mine inventory, the five most likely---or current--- [U.S.
adversaries all command a massive
stockpile](https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/shutting-down-the-sea-russia-china-iran-and-the-hidden-danger-of-sea-mines/) and
the ability to lay mines nearly unimpeded by American
forces]{.underline}.\[3\] Russia and China are estimated to have more
than 100,000 mines each. Some believe North Korea has more than 50,000
mines. Iran's stockpile is estimated in the thousands. Even the Houthi
rebels, funded largely by Iran and al-Qaeda, are fielding
low-tech, [improvised naval mines in the Red
Sea](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saudi-forces-find-more-naval-mines-off-yemen) and
along Yemen's western coast, forcing an international response. Russia
can exert influence throughout Europe, the Mediterranean and Black Seas,
and in the Northern Pacific. China can hold us at bay. North Korea can
make reinforcing our allies to the South very difficult. Iran can, in
theory, shut down access to the Arabian Gulf, causing potentially
calamitous impact to the world economy. And a terrorist organization has
shown interest in a warfare area that can disrupt the choke-point
connecting Europe to the Arabian Peninsula, Africa, and beyond. Our
potential enemies have the resources to stop, or slow us down, in every
area of operations we care about. The mine threat is real. And yet, the
future of the Navy's surface-borne mine countermeasures forces is
unclear.

[**The [current]{.mark} crop of Avenger-class [m]{.mark}ine
[c]{.mark}ounter[m]{.mark}easures [ships are old]{.mark}, tired,
[and]{.mark} too often, [broken]{.mark}. The [outdated equipment does
not operate reliably]{.mark}, having a negative effect on operational
tempo and the proficiency of the crews.** Avengers mostly go unused,
solemn monuments to a time when the U.S. Navy looked beyond air and
missile defense, set alongside otherwise active piers]{.underline}. In a
bittersweet quirk, though, the contrast between the condition of the
ships and their crews is staggering. These ships are crewed by
phenomenal men and women who are motivated and passionate about their
ships. There is a fraternal pride, and unstopping zeal, oozing through
the pores of these small, wooden ships. That esprit de corps---that
pride in being the toughest Sailors on the block---comes from the fact
that at their foundation, these ships are great ships. They are, in
theory, incredibly capable, boasting both minesweeping and mine hunting
capabilities---unique amongst the world's navies---with well-thought
gear and advantageous construction. This reality makes their fall from
grace more frustrating. Though they have withered from the vine, their
keel marks the future of surface-borne mine countermeasures.

Updating, upgrading, and reintroducing a legacy platform is ingrained in
the service's DNA---the Navy has done it throughout its history. In the
surface fleet, a tangential example is the Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer, rolled out in its original specifications and updated in new
construction via follow-on flights, or variants, effectively replacing,
or augmenting, early hulls with further evolved variants of the same
ship. An example more in line with the 21st-century Avenger, though, is
that of the F/A-18 Hornet and its much younger cousins, the Super Hornet
and Growler. The Hornet entered service in 1984 and the [Super
Hornet ](http://www.ausairpower.net/SuperBug.html)did likewise in 2001,
replacing the F-14 Tomcat; though largely a new aircraft, it was
explicitly based on an asset with a 16-year-old airframe. The EA-18G
Growler, itself an even more specialized variant of the Super Hornet,
entered service in 2008 and gradually replaced EA-6B Prowlers---another
example of expanding upon an existing platform. In these cases, the Navy
proved that what is old can be new again. While new and evolutionary
platforms are staples of the world's greatest military might, there are
times when the warfighter simply needs a new version of what they
currently have. [**[Designing a new platform]{.mark} from the keel-up
[takes excessive time]{.mark}, loads of money, and the burden of
competition**---all hallmarks of the Department of Defense's acquisition
labyrinth]{.underline}. There is an opportunity here for the Navy to
jump back into the surface mine countermeasures game quickly and in a
fiscally responsible manner. Build the fleet a new Avenger and get them
back into the fight!

[More than anything else, the Navy's updated mine countermeasures ship
needs to be sustainable. Self-sufficiency is critical and a well-stocked
supporting shore infrastructure will be the foundation of the class's
success.]{.underline} Durable nonmetallic parts, currently a misnomer,
are a must, and making use of emerging 3D-printing technology---already
proven on Navy ships---will ensure longevity and the ability to affect
prompt repairs. Sturdy, high-capacity air conditioners and the
associated sea water pumps and strainers will ensure the ship's combat
systems are appropriately cooled and a semblance of quality of life is
maintained for the crew. The new ships will need new, more powerful
diesel engines, capable of producing higher speeds over longer distances
at an efficient fuel burn rate. [**[The engineering plants also will
need an updated]{.mark}**, reliable bow-thruster, giving ships increased
independence in-port and a superior capability while mine
huntin]{.underline}g. Along with the bow-thruster, a gas-turbine
generator encased in an appropriate module, like its counterparts
throughout the fleet, will guarantee the ship's unique capabilities and
keep the crew and associated equipment safe. Upgraded means---whether it
be SHF, EHF, or a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution---to achieve
and maintain IP services will be extremely important. The combat systems
suite also needs to add Link-16 capability, which will come in handy
when dealing with Navy and allied forces around a minefield, and an
infrared-capable optical sight system to allow watch standers to
identify surrounding contacts on the horizon day and night. To best
achieve the benefits of the surface force's recent focus on a circadian
rhythm for shipboard watch standers---arguably critically important to
the crew executing a slow and drawn-out mission ---the new MCM would
benefit from an increase in crew size from 86 to 110, and thus an
average of 23 new racks and associated berthing accommodations. At a
minimum, the additional rack space would allow a faithful attempt at
providing for an explosive ordnance disposal berthing, thus ensuring
that the future Avenger is able to fold into the mine countermeasures
triad and expand its capabilities through distributed lethality. And,
last but not least, the Navy needs more of these updated hulls---at
least six in every forward deployed location---to ensure operational
commanders' demands can be met in a contingency.

There are excellent and exciting new technologies entering the Fleet and
they no doubt have a positive impact today and will in years to come.
But mine countermeasures is a unique warfare area. Its future largely
lies in its past. [[Emerging]{.mark} Littoral Combat Ship capabilities
and [unmanned]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies may [serve]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} fine [supplements]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} the
[clearing]{.mark} of strategic [waterways]{.mark} is painstaking work
[requiring]{.mark} the [collective knowledge]{.mark} of the fleet's
minemen, engineers, and the tactical experts at the Navy Surface and
Mine Warfare Development Center]{.underline}. The Avenger­-class
minesweeper was a fantastic platform when first conceived, but now it is
ready to retire. Not only would a 21st-century Avenger build on the
capabilities of a time-tested platform, ensuring timely and capable mine
countermeasures forces to fleet commanders, but reinvesting through
innovation as we improve upon the legacy class will keep early command
opportunities alive and well in the Navy's surface warfare officer
community---building future commanders and keeping mine warfare at the
forefront of our future leaders' collective consciousness.

how they want to use littoral combat ships]{.underline}, as the U.S.
Navy tries to refine its operational concepts for these ships.

Development on the LCS mission packages began in the early 2000s and
centered around three warfare areas: surface warfare, mine
countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare.

[So far, only the surface warfare mission package has been fully fielded
and used in overseas deployments. Half of the MCM package]{.underline}

**Domain awareness key to minimize natural disaster impacts and enforce

The concept of [Underwater **Domain Awareness**]{.underline} (UDA) [in a
more specific sense **will translate** to our eagerness to know what is
happening in the undersea realm of our maritime areas.]{.underline}
[This keenness for undersea awareness from the security perspective
means defending our]{.underline} Sea Lines of Communication ([SLOC),
coastal waters and varied maritime assets against the proliferation of
submarines and mine capabilities intended to limit the access to the
seas and littoral waters]{.underline}. However, **[just the military
requirement may not be the only motivation to generate undersea domain
awareness]{.underline}**. [The earth's undersea geophysical activities
have a lot of relevance to the wellbeing of humankind and monitoring of
such activities **could provide vital clues** to **minimise the impact
of devastating natural calamities**]{.underline}. [The commercial
activities in the undersea realm need precise inputs on the availability
of resources to be able to effectively and efficiently explore and
exploit them for economic gains]{.underline}. **[The
regulators]{.underline}** on the other hand **[need to know the pattern
of exploitation to manage a sustainable plan]{.underline}**. [With so
much of activities, commercial and military, there is **significant
impact on the environment**.]{.underline} [Any conservation initiative
needs to precisely estimate the habitat degradation and species
vulnerability caused by these activities and assess the ecosystem
status]{.underline}. The scientific and the research community needs to
engage and continuously update our knowledge and access of the multiple
aspects of the undersea domain. Fig. 2, presents a comprehensive
perspective of the UDA framework. The underlying requirement for all the
stakeholders is to know the developments in the undersea domain, make
sense out of these developments and then respond effectively and
efficiently to them before they take shape of an event.

**Natural disasters cause extinction and outweigh**

**Sid-Ahmed 5** \[Mohamed, Al-Ahram Weekly Editor, Jan 6, "The
post-earthquake world," http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/724/op3.htm\]

The human species has never been exposed to a natural upheaval of this
magnitude within living memory. What happened in South Asia is the
ecological equivalent of 9/11. Ecological problems like global warming
and **climatic disturbances in general threaten to make our natural
habitat unfit for human life. The [extinction of the species has become
a very real possibility]{.underline}**, whether by our own hand or **[as
a result of natural disasters]{.underline}** of a much greater magnitude
than the Indian Ocean earthquake and the killer waves it spawned. Human
civilisation has developed in the hope that Man will be able to reach
welfare and prosperity on earth for everybody. But now things seem to be
moving in the opposite direction, exposing planet Earth to the end of
its role as a nurturing place for human life. Today, **[human
conflicts]{.underline}** have become less of a threat than the
confrontation between Man and Nature. At least they **[are less likely
to bring about the end of the human species]{.underline}. The reactions
of Nature** as a result of its exposure to the onslaughts of human
societies **have become more important in determining the fate of the
human species** than any harm it can inflict on itself. **Until
recently, the threat Nature represented was perceived as likely to arise
only in the long run**, related for instance to how global warming would
affect life on our planet. Such a threat could take decades, even
centuries, to reach a critical level. **This perception has changed
following the devastating earthquake and tsunamis** that hit the coastal
regions of South Asia and, less violently, of East Africa, on 26
December. This cataclysmic event has underscored the vulnerability of
our world before the wrath of Nature and shaken the sanguine belief that
the end of the world is a long way away. **Gone are the days when we
could comfort ourselves with the notion that the extinction of the human
race will not occur before a long-term future** that will only
materialise after millions of years and not affect us directly in any
way. **[We are now forced to live with the possibility of an imminent
demise of humankind.]{.underline}**

([[Hu)mankind is becoming ever more susceptible to natural
disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}, largely as a consequence of population
growth and globalization. [[It is likely that in the future, we will
experience **several disasters per year** that kill more than 10,000
people]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[A calamity with a million casualties is
just a matter of time.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[This situation is mainly
a consequence of **increased vulnerability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Climate change may also be affecting the frequency of extreme weather
events as well as the vulnerability of coastal areas due to sea-level
rise. [[Disastrous outcomes can only increase unless better ways are
found to mitigate the effects through **improved
forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark} and warning, together with more
community preparedness and resilience. There are particular difficulties
with extreme events, which can affect several countries, while the
largest events can have global consequences. The hazards of
supervolcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts could cause global disaster
with threats to civilization and deaths of billions of people. Although
these are very rare events, they will happen and require consideration.
More frequent and smaller events in the wrong place at the wrong time
could have very large human, environmental and economic effects. A
sustained effort is needed to identify places at risk and take steps to
apply science before the events occur. The natural world can be a
dramatic, dynamic and dangerous place. Life ultimately thrives on Earth
because it is a dynamic planet, but the extremes of nature can threaten
the survival of individuals, communities and even species. Every year
television pictures and newspapers report scenes of devastation, despair
and death caused by huge earthquakes, floods, droughts, cyclones,
landslides and volcanic eruptions. [The Asian tsunami, with around
250 000 deaths, huge economic losses and long-term damage to development
programmes in the affected countries, brought home]{.underline} to the
world [the realities of the danger]{.underline}. We live in times of
increasing vulnerability to extreme natural hazards. The Asian tsunami
was a truly global disaster which affected not only many countries in
the region, but also tourists from the developed world on holiday in
southeast Asia. For example, the incident represented the greatest loss
of life of Swedish citizens from a natural event. Again, Hurricane
Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in September 2005, had global
effects on oil prices and showed that even the world\'s most powerful
and wealthy country experiences difficulties with the extremes of
nature.

a technology that involves learning by example rather than waiting for

process of creating and using the machine learning algorithm that powers
your AI's decisions requires a data scientist to:

Prepare relevant learning examples.

Set the goal to be achieved or optimized.

Review the fitted patterns and outputs, iterating to ensure desired
behavior.

Deploy the machine learning model into production.

Use [ML Ops tools](https://www.datarobot.com/platform/mlops/) and
practices to define and monitor key performance indicators and manage
system health.

To get from machine learning to an AI system, you need to broaden step

At the beginning of Sect.  "One Decisive Objection to the Finality
Argument", I noted that the artificial agents currently in existence
seem to corroborate the finality argument in that [their goal or
"utility function" is defined arbitrarily by their creators]{.underline}
and not subject to change while they are operating. The finality
argument's proponents appear to take their bearings from this
circumstance. When they envision a future human-equivalent or superhuman
AI, they imagine it on the model of the machines of our day.25 [They
overlook that there is a big difference between today's artificial
agents and a human-equivalent AI: **[Today's systems]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [not]{.mark} general [intelligences]{.mark}**. [Their
understanding]{.mark} of the world, or "world model," [is]{.mark}
[limited]{.mark} to a particular domain and remains fixed]{.underline}
throughout their operation, which is why their (understanding of the)
goal can remain fixed, too. [A [self-driving]{.mark} [car]{.mark}, to
return to this example, **[has no capacity of learning]{.mark}** about
things outside the domain of road traffic]{.underline}, so there is no
chance that it could develop an understanding of the world whereby the
goal of "driving safely and efciently from one place to another upon the
user's command" may shift in meaning or lose its validity. [A general
AI, by contrast, would have that capacity]{.underline}. It would develop
a general understanding of normativity and consequently come to evaluate
and, maybe, change the goal that it has been originally given.

[Machine learning (ML) is the new age electricity]{.underline}. When
electricity was discovered, nobody had anticipated the far-reaching

[**Artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}) [is]{.mark} a much [broader

field of AI has been around for over six decades, and it went through a
few hype and bust cycles during this period. During the hype period, AI
research would show a lot of promise; however, when the promise didn't
materialize, it was often followed by a bust cycle. During the bust
cycles, the interest in AI waned (less funding for research, etc.). The
last bust cycle was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The AI bust
cycles are popularly known as AI Winters. [The current excitement in ML
and AI is different from previous AI hype cycles, because unlike
previous hype cycles, ML techniques are being deployed to solve
real-world problems in daily lives.]{.underline}

AI design and development includes small, individualized applications,
such as smartphones, as well as the broad field of large-scale,
federated systems capable of making intelligent decisions as a
collective, such as that required for autonomous vehicles. [Machine
Learning **([ML]{.mark}) [is]{.mark} a [foundational basis for
AI]{.mark}** that seeks [to]{.mark} [provide]{.mark}
**[knowledge]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [computers]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
[data]{.mark}**, observations and interacting with the world, thereby
allowing computers to correctly generalize to new settings]{.underline}
\[4\]. Recent advancements in hardware that enable rapid, on-board
processing of huge data sets have spurred the development of special
architectures for ML algorithms, such as those required for Deep Neural
Networks (DNN). These architectures are composed of multiple levels of
non-linear operations, such as in neural networks with many hidden
layers \[4\]. AI technologies provide the underlying capability for
autonomous systems. **[[While]{.mark} [autonomy]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[enabled]{.mark} by AI, [not]{.mark} [all]{.mark} [uses]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [AI]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [autonomous]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
For example, [many [AI]{.mark} capabilities are [used]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [augment human decision]{.mark} making, [**rather than
replace it**.]{.mark} To be autonomous, a system must have the
capability to independently compose and select among different courses
of action to accomplish goals based on its knowledge and understanding
of the world, itself, and the situation]{.underline} \[5[\].
**[An]{.mark} [autonomous]{.mark} [system]{.mark} [must]{.mark} be
capable of [learn]{.mark}ing [from]{.mark} [previous]{.mark}
[experience]{.mark} and taking action based on what it has learned**.
Autonomy is enabled by the integration of the same three fundamental
capabilities: sense (observe and orient), decide, act, and
communicate]{.underline} \[6\]. Unlike automation, which uses various
control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, and whose
functioning cannot accommodate ambiguity or adjust to uncertainties,
autonomy includes a decision-making component that leverages
computational intelligence and learning algorithms, or AI, to better
adapt to unanticipated and changing situations \[7\]. Recent commercial
advances in autonomy result from the convergence of technological
breakthroughs in the fields of AI (such as facial recognition and deep
neural networks) and computing hardware (such as graphical processing
units (GPUs)), combined with the unprecedented availability of labelled
data, to enable real-time or near real-time analysis and decision-making
by human-machine systems.

Gower considers underwater **[drones to be "the least likely innovation
to make a difference in the decline of submarine
stealth.]{.underline}**" A [navy would need a lot of drones, data rates
are exceedingly slow, and a drone's transmission range is
short]{.underline}. [Drones are also noisy and extremely easy to detect.
"Not to mention that controlling thousands of underwater drones far
exceeds current technological capabilities]{.underline}," he adds. Gower
says it could be possible "[to use drones and sonar networks together in
choke points to detect submarine patrols."]{.underline} Among the
strategically important submarine patrol choke points are the exit
routes on either side of Ireland, for U.K. submarines; those around the
islands of Hainan and Taiwan, for Chinese submarines; in the Barents or
Kuril Island chain, for Russian submarines; and the Straits of Juan de
Fuca, for U.S. Pacific submarines. On the other hand, he notes, "They
could be monitored and removed since they would be close to sovereign
territories. As such, [the challenges would likely outweigh the
gains."]{.underline}

Another [problem is how quickly we have spun back up to Cold War-like
hostility]{.underline}. During the old Cold War, which lasted from the
late 1940s until around 1989, settled patterns of non-engagement had
time to evolve. Those patterns did not disappear entirely in the 21st
century; during the conflict in Syria, for example, [[West]{.mark}ern
powers [made extensive efforts to deconflict]{.mark} with Russia. **But
[when the fighting is closer to home for Moscow, all bets are]{.mark}
apparently [off]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Last year a Russian Su-24 jet
buzzed the U.S. Navy destroyer Donald Cook in the Black Sea, at one
point passing as near as 100 yards. And last month, Russian Su-35 jets
came close to American P-8A surveillance planes on three separate
occasions. (One of the Russian aircraft passed within five feet of an
American plane, according to U.S. officials.) Even if a similar close
call does lead to a collision, it need not necessarily escalate to war.
But [Russia's cavalier attitude becomes more dangerous in the context of
its Ukrainian invasion and hostile intent]{.underline}. Picture this
scenario: Many modern Western aircraft can detect an enemy aircraft
acquiring a target. If they encounter a Russian pilot in acquisition
mode --- for instance, while flying in contested airspace over the Black
Sea --- they may conclude that they've become the target and act
accordingly, leading to a potential incident with casualties. If treated
as a violation of NATO's Article 5 --- which deems an attack on one NATO
member as an attack on all --- such contact and potential casualties
could draw the alliance, and therefore the United States, into the
conflict. Of course, the alliance could choose not to view the incident
as a violation, or to pursue only a minimal response. But that could
call NATO's resolve into doubt, frightening frontline allies and
emboldening Mr. Putin. [The [longevity of the Cold War]{.mark} also
[gave]{.mark} both sides [time and incentive to negotiate]{.mark} arms
control agreements]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} and its allies
[concluded a host of detailed treaties with Moscow]{.underline} that,
while flawed, at least provided predictability and monitoring --- [all
while serving to build a long-term relationship in managing nuclear
danger.]{.underline} In recent years, however, [both [sides rashly
shed]{.mark} many of [these accords, seeing them as]{.mark} outdated and
**inconveniently [constraining]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The [New
START]{.underline} Treaty [is now the only restraint]{.underline} on the
number and types of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons --- [and it expires
in 2026, with little hope of renewal]{.underline}. [Already gone are the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treat]{.underline}y, which George W. Bush
abrogated in 2002, and [the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
Treaty]{.underline}, from which Mr. Putin "suspended" Russian
participation in 2007. And, most relevant to today's crisis, in 2019
President Donald Trump abrogated the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty]{.underline} over U.S. claims of Russian violations and Chinese
arms buildup (though China was not a party to the treaty). Signed by
President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987,
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty eliminated that class of
weapons entirely. Now that it is no more, Mr. Putin claims to fear that
the alliance could deploy such weapons on Ukrainian territory against
Russian targets. He has cited that possibility, along with denying that
Ukraine is a separate country, among his motivations for invading
Ukraine. **[[Even if Moscow can be brought back to the negotiating
table]{.mark}, [which seems highly unlikely]{.mark} for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}**, [[it would]{.mark} [take years of painstaking
talks]{.mark}]{.underline} to resurrect these treaties. Their
disappearance is especially grievous in light of other losses --- of
military-to-military communication, expelled embassy and consulate staff
members --- and the development of new forms of weapons, such as
hypersonic missiles and cyberwarfare. [Two of the world's largest
military powers are now functioning in near-total isolation from each
other, which is a danger to everyone]{.underline}.

Ukraine did not provoke the war, and Putin likely would prefer to
convert Ukraine into Russian territory once again. [This is not another
Cold War. There is nothing "cold" about naked, violent
aggression]{.underline}. This is a new kind of war and the U.S. and its
friends allies in the transatlantic community are going to learn how to

The good news is that, as was true 60 years ago, the deliberate,
persistent, and personal advocacy of leaders in both Washington and
Moscow can go a long way toward overcoming these barriers. Without a
clear sense for how this conflict ends, however[, it is hard to say
whether or when there will be political will for this kind of work on
either side]{.underline}. What is certain is that [Putin's recent
actions do not align with last year's]{.underline} U.S.-Russia
Presidential Joint [Statement]{.underline}, which affirmed [that, "even
in periods of tension, \[the United States and Russia\] are able to make
progress on our shared goals of ensuring predictability in the strategic

[One challenge to establishing rules of the road for autonomous systems'

developments enabled submarines, which were highly effective in
attacking ships but unable to feasibly comply with existing prize law
without putting themselves at risk of attack by surfacing. **[Despite

submarines, the incentives for defecting from the existing rules were
too great (and the rules failed to adapt), and the result was
unrestricted submarine warfare]{.underline}**.68 [Another
challenge]{.underline} to a potential autonomous incidents [agreement is

One of the major long-term challenges for the [**[OSCE]{.mark}**
is]{.underline} her **[[lack]{.underline}]{.mark}** of **[[adequate
resources.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Since the [economic crisis of
2008-09]{.underline}, [the OSCE's budget]{.underline} **[has been
gradually declining]{.underline}**. The Organization's approved annual
budget for 2018 was only [137.8 million
euros](https://www.osce.org/annual-report/2018), which is very low for
the world's largest regional security organization with 16 field
presences across the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian space. This decline has
been partially compensated by extra-budgetary funding through voluntary
contributions, which in 2018 reached [40.9
million](https://www.osce.org/annual-report/2018). But even with
factoring in this uncertain source of income, the OSCE's overall
financial resources hardly match those of most UN peacekeeping
operations. For instance, the annual budget of the United Nations
Mission in South Sudan alone is [over 1 billion U.S.
dollars](https://undocs.org/en/A/C.5/72/25).

[Many **[insiders]{.mark}** [agree]{.mark}]{.underline} that the OSCE is
a relatively effective and efficient organization, especially when
compared to other multilateral institutions. Yet, some of the [OSCE
[participating]{.mark}]{.underline} [[States have]{.mark} [been pursuing
the]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**[zero nominal
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}" policy [that has been **pushing** the
**Organization to its limits for several years**.]{.underline} If this
trend is not reversed, [[the OSCE]{.mark} slowly but certainly risks
[los]{.mark}ing [its]{.mark} [operational]{.mark} capabilities,
credibility and, in the long term, **[relevance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Another major challenge relates to the [[lack of formally]{.mark}
recognized [legal]{.mark} [status]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the
OSCE participating States agreed already in 1993 that the Organization
should be granted full legal personality similar to the United Nations
and their bodies, [there has been **[little]{.mark}**
**[progress]{.mark}** in this regard **[over the past 25
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2007, a draft convention on legal
personality and privileges and immunities was for the OSCE was agreed by
an expert group but has not been adopted so far.

While this may seem like a theoretical problem, it has very concrete
practical consequences, especially in a crisis situation. For instance,
[the first monitors]{.underline} in [Ukraine had to be
deployed]{.underline} **[without appropriate privileges, immunities, and
security guarantees from]{.underline}** [the host country]{.underline},
and the Mission's operations were hampered as they were not able to open
bank accounts, enter into contracts, and import much-needed equipment.
These obstacles were removed only after several weeks when a memorandum
of understanding with the host authorities was concluded.

[The **[decentralized nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the Organization
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [[poses challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[for an effective functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} of the OSCE, its
visibility and profile. Compared to other international organizations,
the mandate of the OSCE Secretary General is relatively restrictive. The
Secretary General functions mainly as a Chief Administrative Officer but
a high degree of autonomy in both political and financial matters
enjoyed by the Organization's executive structures, namely [its 16 field
operations]{.underline} [and 3 autonomous institutions is hampering this
role]{.underline}. For instance, [**[the heads of the OSCE]{.mark}**
field operations **[manage their own budgets]{.mark}**, are selected and
appointed by the OSCE Chairmanship]{.underline}, and report back to the
OSCE Permanent Council. Also, [the Secretary General's political role is
very limited]{.underline}. The main responsibility for political
guidance lies with the Chairmanship that rotates on an annual basis.
Even in a crisis situation, the Secretary General's powers are very
limited; although he/she is mandated to bring to the participating
States' attention any situation of emerging tension or conflict, [there
are [no instruments]{.mark} for early action at his/her disposal, [such
as dispatching]{.mark} [a small]{.mark} fact-finding [monitoring]{.mark}
or mediation [team]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Last but not least,]{.underline} [the current form of
**[decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline} within the OSCE **[based on
[consensus rule]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[hinders any meaningful
progress]{.underline}**. [The problem]{.underline} [with the consensus
rule]{.underline} [is not its existence]{.underline} [but the fact that
it **[has been interpreted in]{.mark}** **[absolute terms]{.mark}**
**[for many years.]{.mark}** The]{.underline} consensus rule is crucial
for inclusiveness and legitimacy of decisions in a political body such
as the OSCE. However, if it is taken too literally and applied to all
areas, including, for instance, procedural issues such as adopting the
agendas of most meetings, it leads to micromanagement and hinders the
Organization's work. [It also **allows any participating** **State to
hold the Organization** "**hostage**" **to its immediate political
interests** and agenda, which has been clearly visible in the budget
negotiations over recent years.]{.underline}

**[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** [meets AIP technology with
**[Reis-class project]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The Turkish Navy]{.underline} [will have]{.underline} [AIP
technology]{.underline} [based]{.underline} [on the proven]{.underline}
Howaldswerke-Deutsche Werft ([HDW]{.underline}) [fuel cell]{.underline}
with the Reis-class submarines. The AIP system employs fuel cell
technology, including a PEM Fuel Cell (2x120kw) and high capacity
batteries (232 units), allowing the submarine to sustain long-endurance
deployments without snorkeling.

[The Turkish Navy will]{.underline} [receive]{.underline}
**[[six]{.underline}]{.mark}** Type 214 TN AIP **[[submarines]{.mark} as
part of this program]{.underline}**. [On March 23, 2021, the Golcuk
Naval Shipyard floated out the leading boat of the project, TCG Piri
Reis,](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/03/turkey-floats-out-its-first-aip-submarine-piri-reis/) which
is scheduled to enter service in 2022. For the next five years, the
remaining boats will be built and commissioned. The Reis class
submarines will be capable to deploy heavyweight torpedoes (DM2A4,
indigenous AKYA, and MK48 Mod 6AT), anti-ship missiles (Sub-Harpoon,
maybe indigenous ATMACA in after the first sub), and mines.

Reis-class submarines & Regional Balances

[While naval forces are not the only instruments for regional
balance]{.underline}, [**they [should be regarded as key
actors]{.mark}** due to their roles of]{.underline} "[supporting
government policies]{.underline}" [in peacetime]{.underline} [and
striking capabilities during conflicts]{.underline}. As a result, [the
countries **conduct comprehensive naval modernization**]{.underline}
**[and acquisition programs]{.underline}** [in accordance with their
economic situation and infrastructure.]{.underline}

[Sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline}, [[whose]{.mark} strategic
[importance]{.mark}]{.underline} has already been highlighted, **[[have
a direct impact]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the countrys' [A2/AD
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a result, [the quantity,
types]{.underline}, [capabilities, and weapon power]{.underline} [of
[the]{.mark} submarine [fleet **affect regional
balances**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because, [the increased number of
submarines]{.underline} [allows for greater control]{.underline} [over
larger maritime]{.underline} [areas]{.underline} [while remaining
undetected]{.underline}, [and because these submarines may remain
underwater for extended periods of time, causing the fleets of other
countries to face increased uncertainty.]{.underline}

One important example of this issue is Greece's Foreign Minister [Nikos
Dendias' repeated warnings to
Germany](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/258951/dendias-urges-berlin-to-halt-sale-of-submarines-to-ankara/) to
block the sale of Type 214 class submarines to Turkey. He repeatedly
stated that acquiring these submarines will tip the regional balance in
Turkey's favor.

Russia, Greece, Israel, and Egypt have the most significant fleets in
Turkey's neighboring seas. Only Greece and Israel have AIP-capable
submarines among these states. Greece currently operates four Type 214
AIP submarines and one Type 209 AIP upgraded submarine. Israel operates
two [Dolphin-II](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/01/israels-submarine-secret-new-dolphin-class-boat-could-have-vls/) class
AIP submarines, one Dolphin-II submarine is currently under
construction, and has recently ordered three [Dakar-class
submarines](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/01/israel-orders-3-new-dakar-class-submarines-from-tkms/) from
TKMS.

Turkey, which will have six AIP-capable Reis-class submarines after
2027, will have the most AIP submarines in the region with Israel
(although the schedule of Dakar class submarines is not yet known),
compared to Greece's five. In addition, Turkey aims to commission 4-6
national submarines (MILDEN), which will be AIP capable and possibly
armed with indigenous GEZGIN strategic missiles. In the second half of
the 2030s, the delicate balance of the region is likely to change in
favor of Turkey in terms of AIP submarines. (MILDENs will replace
Turkey's aging Type 209/1200 (AY class) submarines.)

Black Sea

[Following the invasion of Crimea]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}
[strengthened the Black Sea Fleet]{.underline} at the Sevastopol Naval
Base [to preserve a]{.underline} [strategic balance against
NATO]{.underline} [expansion]{.underline} [into Eastern
Europe]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [the wider Black Sea
region.]{.underline} According to open-source statements, the Russian
Black Sea Fleet's warships increased from 34 to 49, while submarines
increased from 1 to 7.

[The Russian Black Sea force]{.underline} [operates improved Kilo-class
submarines]{.underline} that can launch Kalibr land-attack missiles but
are not AIP-capable.

**[[The Reis-class submarine's]{.mark} commissioning [is likely to have
an impact on the Black Sea balance]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}** The
Turkish Navy currently has 12 diesel-electric submarines, and after the
Reis-class is operational, the total number of submarines will be 18 (6
AIP + 12 non-AIP). This submarine force would be capable to penetrate
Russia's strong A2/AD in the Black Sea.

According to the Montreux Convention, which governs the straits' transit
regime as well as regulating the tonnage and types of naval assets
deployed in the Black Sea by non-Black Sea states, the non-Black Sea
countries are not permitted to deploy submarines in the region. As a
result, [as a NATO ally]{.underline}, [Turkey's submarine fleet is
**[the only asset capable of]{.mark} [countering]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[the **[Russian Navy's ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on behalf of

[[Türkiye]{.underline}]{.mark} [has **[found and safely disposed of a
sea mine]{.mark}** off the Black Sea coast]{.underline}, the National
Defense Ministry said. 

The area was secured immediately after the mine was spotted by patrol
aircraft off Kocaeli, and underwater explosive ordnance disposal units
successfully neutralised it, the ministry tweeted on Wednesday.

[This is the third sea]{.underline} [mine]{.underline} [discovered by
Turkish authorities]{.underline} [since]{.underline} the beginning of
[the Ukraine-Russia conflict]{.underline}, [with the first
detected]{.underline} [off the northern coast of Igneada]{.underline}
[near the]{.underline} [Bulgarian]{.underline} [maritime border
and]{.underline} [the second spotted at the entrance to the Bosporus in
March.]{.underline}

Where are they from?

[[Several hundred mines]{.underline}]{.mark} [have [drifted into the
Black Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} after breaking off from cables near
Ukrainian ports, according to Russia\'s main intelligence agency.

\"Due to storm weather, the cables connecting the mines to anchors were
broken,\" Russia\'s Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a press
release dated March 19. \"Due to wind and water currents, the mines are
drifting freely in the western part of the Black Sea.\"

Viktor Vyshnov, deputy head of Ukraine's state-run Maritime
Administration, said \"This is complete disinformation from the Russian
side,\" adding, \"This was done to justify the closure of these
districts of the Black Sea under so-called \'danger of mines.\'\"

The Ukrainian navy said it alone had the right to distribute safety
notices about its part of the Black Sea and cast Moscow\'s warning as an
attempt at information \"piracy.\"

Ukraine\'s foreign ministry said that Russia was planting naval mines in
the Black Sea as \"uncontrolled drifting ammunition,\" turning them
\"into a de facto weapon of indiscriminate action.\"

[Some observers]{.underline} [have said the mines]{.underline} [drifted
from a Ukrainian sea blockade, but that has not been
verified]{.underline}.

420 naval mines

The FSB said around [420 mines had broken loose]{.underline}, claiming
that the mines were set by Ukrainian forces.

Russian reports said that these mines were made during the Soviet era in
the first half of the 20th Century, adding that Ukraine planted these
mines at the beginning of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The types of
mines are "YM" weighing 17kg and "YRM" weighing 30kg, both can be placed
one or two metres below the surface of the sea. The mine can explode
once it is touched.

[[Experts]{.mark} [urged]{.mark} that]{.underline} **[[all Black Sea
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[should cooperate]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the search operation to]{.mark} **[detect all
drifting mines]{.mark}**]{.underline} which could threaten international
navigation.

The Samsun NAVTEX station of the Turkish Naval Forces' office of
navigation issued a statement on March 21 warning ships in the Black Sea
against the mines.

The station requested that ships in the vicinity immediately report any
detection of drifted mines or mine-like objects to the Turkish main
search and rescue coordination centre and the Turkish Naval Forces.

[Detecting stray mines]{.underline}

[**[Türkiye]{.mark}** [is one of the]{.mark} countries among [NATO
members]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[most prepared for such mines; its naval
army has 11 minesweepers always ready to act]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
However, naval teams may face difficulty in detecting these mines due to
weather conditions. 

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar earlier said that minehunter vessels, along
with maritime patrol aircraft, are constantly monitoring waterways near
the Turkish coasts in the Black Sea region to detect and neutralise
drifting mines.

Akar also said both the Russian and Ukrainian sides had been notified
and that coordination is ongoing.

[The Black Sea is a major shipping route for grain]{.underline}, oil and

First and foremost, due to security idiosyncrasies. [[Europe]{.mark}
**[is not a collective]{.mark} [security]{.mark}
[guarantor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It dismissed this opportunity in 1954
when
France [refused](https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/1c8aa583-8ec5-41c4-9ad8-73674ea7f4a7/bd191c42-0f53-4ec0-a60a-c53c72c747c2) to
establish a [European Defence Community
(EDC)](https://aei.pitt.edu/5201/1/5201.pdf). Thus, despite [continuous
efforts](https://www.e-ir.info/2016/05/12/a-comparative-historical-study-of-the-development-of-a-european-army/) ever
since, Europe does not have an army nor a deterrent capability[. [It
is,]{.mark} in fact,]{.underline} **[[highly]{.mark} [dependent]{.mark}
[on NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[individual]{.mark} nuclear [powers]{.mark} (]{.underline}predominantly
the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK and France) to guarantee its
collective security.

However, the Russo-Ukrainian war displays the Euro-Atlantic
community's [inability](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-04-08/was-ukraine-wrong-give-its-nukes) to
maintain [security
assurances](https://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/resources/fact-sheets/critical-issues/5442-negative-security-assurances) previously
given to Kyiv under the [1994 Budapest
Memorandum](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%203007/Part/volume-3007-I-52241.pdf).
In this political agreement, the US, the UK and Russia pledged not to
use military force against Ukraine in exchange for it renouncing the
nuclear weapons it
had [inherited](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12715/inheriting-bomb) from
the Soviet Union. Russia violated this agreement at least twice -- with
the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine -- and
the Euro-Atlantic guarantor countries failed to protect Ukraine.

However, [the Memorandum's greatest weakness lay in the fact **that [it
was only politically]{.mark}**, [and not **legally,
binding**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why Ukrainian President
Volodymyr
[[Zelenskyy [demands](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/dlya-ukrayinskoyi-derzhavi-pitannya-bezpeki-maye-buti-na-per-74113)]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[legally
binding [security
guarantees](https://www.shrmonitor.org/what-security-guarantees/)]{.underline}]{.mark}** [instead]{.underline}
of the Memorandum's politically binding security assurances.

As a non-nuclear weapon state, which is not protected under a security
guarantee by a nuclear weapon state or a nuclear alliance such as NATO,
Ukraine was exposed to aggression or intended regime change carried out
by
an [NPT](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text/)-recognised
nuclear weapon state. Hence, Europe and NATO could not have provided
a [nuclear
umbrella](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nuclear-umbrella) to
a non-allied state such as Ukraine. Without security guarantees or
NATO's [extended nuclear
deterrence](https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/AFDP_3-72/3-72-D12-NUKE-OPS-Extended-Deterrence.pdf),
Ukraine was on its own in its direct confrontation against Russia.

Given the inability of major nuclear powers to uphold the Budapest
Memorandum and the difficulty of
enforcing [credible](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/91/3/505/2326836?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) security
assurances due to Moscow's actions,
Ukraine [proposed](https://kyivindependent.com/national/ukraine-seeks-security-guarantees-stronger-than-natos-outlines-other-terms-for-peace-deal-with-russia/),
on 29thMarch, security guarantees in which guarantor countries (such as
the P5) must consult each other within three days after the beginning of
military aggression or hybrid war. Within this scheme, after
consultations, this group of countries must provide aid to Kyiv by
sending troops, supplying weapons, and protecting Ukraine's airspace.
Ultimately, this proposal would exclude security guarantees potentially
given by NATO or the EU and would 'deresponsibilize' Europe as a
collective security guarantor of Ukraine.

[The second reason Europe failed]{.underline} to prevent Putin's war in
Ukraine **[is because of nuclear policy choices]{.underline}**. [[The EU
is]{.mark} basically **[a non-prolif]{.mark}eration
[actor]{.mark}**]{.underline} (not a [nuclear
deterrent](https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/euro-nukes-a-difficult-but-perhaps-necessary-debate/) one) [**[who
supports the NPT]{.mark}** as the cornerstone of the global]{.underline}
[nuclear disarmament]{.underline} and non-proliferation regime. Since
Ukraine's independence in 1991, the EU has shown that its interests lie
primarily in the physical protection of nuclear facilities and materials
of the former Soviet states, leading to the establishment
of [TACIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/4390-what-is-tacis).
Indeed, Brussels proved to be more concerned about the energy aspects
of [nuclear
security](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Implications-Ukraine-conflict-national-nuclear-security-policy.pdf),
generated mainly by the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, than
with the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.

It was only in the aftermath of Moscow's invasion of Crimea and Donbass
in 2014 that the EU's Russia policy took Ukraine's security seriously
into account. But Brussels did not provide nuclear deterrent
capabilities against Russia for the reasons stated above and, most
importantly, as it is a de facto NPT regime guarantor.

The EU is critical of the view that more nuclear weapons can induce
stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation (nuclear
stability theory),
prominently [defended](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/05679328108457394) by
neo-realist Kenneth Waltz. As an NPT regime guarantor, Brussels supports
the idea that nuclear proliferation is potentially the greatest threat
to international and European security, requiring a concerted and
multilateral response. For example, the [2003 EU Strategy against
Proliferation of
WMD](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15708-2003-INIT/en/pdf) stated
that the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states not only
increases the likelihood of interstate nuclear conflict but increases
the chances of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent
non-state groups who are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation.

Therefore, the EU has been more politically engaged in ensuring Kyiv
would not obtain nuclear weapons (mentioned, for example, in Article 11
of the [EU-Ukraine Association
Agreement](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22014A0529(01)&from=EN))
than in providing Ukraine with some kind of 'security (nuclear)
umbrella'.

[The third reason is **due to [divergent political
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} among EU member states.Since March
2014, the EU has adopted a strict non-recognition policy regarding
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. This policy led to
substantive [sanctions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/restrictive-measures-against-russia-over-ukraine/) against
Russia and prompted the EU to agree on [five guiding
principles](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/614698/EPRS_BRI(2018)614698_EN.pdf) to
punish Russia's aggression against Ukraine. However, these actions did
not deter Moscow in Ukraine nor prevent the EU from negotiating trade
and energy deals with Russia. **[[A lack of
coherence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[among EU members]{.underline}]{.mark}
[affected]{.mark} the effective [[implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the guiding principles and [[restrictive
measures]{.underline}]{.mark} [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[different]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}**
interests and **[[positions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[towards
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** conditioned by threat perceptions,
economic interests,and energy dependence.

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, four key threat perception
conclusions emerged: 1) a state geographically close to an adverse
nuclear power increases threat perception (e.g. Finland and Sweden); 2)
a state geographically far from an adverse nuclear power decreases
threat perception (e.g. Portugal and Spain); 3) a shared history of
conflict increases threat perception (e.g. the Baltic States and
Poland); 4) a non-shared history of conflict decreases threat perception
(e.g. Italy). In sum, the different degrees of [threat
perception](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1579/RAND_RR1579.pdf) of
each European state towards Russia undermined the idea of European
solidarity and cohesion and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the EU as
a political player with regard to Ukraine.

**[[Europe's energy dependence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is
another]{.underline}]{.mark} conditioning [[factor]{.underline}]{.mark}
of political divergence within the EU. For example, the impact of
Russia's policy over EU politics towards Ukraine, especially through its
bargaining power in the [energy
sector](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51618) (namely
through Russian business proxies Nord stream and Gazprom), led the Union
to become more inactive and less effective. Other Russian activities --
such as increased activities of [Russian funded
media](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/05/23/russian-election-interference-europe-s-counter-to-fake-news-and-cyber-attacks-pub-76435),
[[intensified contact]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} Brussels and other **[[European countries

of [disinformation](https://www.aies.at/download/2018/AIES-Fokus_2018-03.pdf),
and
the [sponsoring](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/russia-ukraine-war-putin-europe-far-right-funding-conservatives/) of
Eurosceptic political forces -- [[impacted the ability of the **EU to
act effectively**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in opposition to Russian
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Furthermore, while the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association
Agreement served as an important display of the EU's economic and
political force (soft power) towards Kyiv, Russia continued to be one of
the EU's main economic and [trade
partners](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/russia_en#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20EU%20was,amounted%20to%20%E2%82%AC257.5%20billion.).
In fact, European countries with different economic interests continued
to negotiate large trade
and [energy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/europe-races-to-break-energy-ties-with-russia/) deals
with Russia at least until February 2022.

This contrasting dual approach led to, even if indirectly, the
continuous funding of Moscow's aggression machine in Ukraine. For
example, despite the 2014 [EU arms
embargo](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0833),
according to a
recent [report](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/eu-states-exported-weapons-to-russia/),
ten EU member states (France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech
Republic, Croatia, Finland, Slovakia and Spain) exported weapons to
Russia until at least 2020. These countries relied on the use of
a [legal
loophole](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/eu-states-exported-weapons-to-russia/) in
EU regulations that allowed the continuation of arms exports "contracts
concluded before 1 August 2014 or ancillary contracts necessary for the
execution of such contracts". These legal loopholes, combined with other
conditioning factors of political divergence, contributed to the
half-hearted implementation of the EU sanctions policy.

**[Ultimately, Europe could not prevent a Russian military invasion of
Ukraine because of the EU's security idiosyncrasies, nuclear policy
choices, divergent political interests, energy dependency and
ineffective sanctions policy on Russia]{.underline}**. Despite its
failure to prevent the war, Europe has taken [relevant
steps](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-response-ukraine-invasion/) over
the past two months to respond to the invasion: They have rapprochement
with their Atlantic allies (the UK and the US) and, among other
initiatives, have established a [Strategic Compass on Security and
Defence](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/strategic_compass_en3_web.pdf),
which could represent a unique opportunity for the EU tobecome a "more
assertive and decisive security provider".

The last big threat posed by Russian forces is their unpredictability
and way of operations.

Unlike other countries, Russia uses naval deployments to stage major
firepower demonstrations far from home. In early 2022, there was uproar
as a Russian Navy task group off the coast of Ireland initially moved to
try and conduct a major live-fire serial, which was later cancelled
after diplomatic protests.

[Russian military exercises off coast of Ireland \'not
welcome\'](https://www.forces.net/news/russian-military-exercises-coast-ireland-not-welcome)

[Take a tour of a Royal Navy

[Know Your Missiles -- the UK\'s most high-tech
firepower](https://www.forces.net/technology/weapons-and-kit/know-your-missiles-uks-most-high-tech-firepower)

It is unlikely that Russia would react in a similar manner if NATO were
to stage similar live-fire exercises only a few miles off the coast of
Murmansk and would be far more aggressive. This unpredictability and
willingness to act in a way contrary to how others operate poses a real
issue.

Similarly, the deployment of Russian long-range maritime patrol aircraft
to support their naval deployments, which often trail lengthy radio
cables and pose a threat to civil aviation due to Russian unwillingness
to talk to Civilian Air Traffic Control necessitates RAF and other air
force deployments of interceptor aircraft to monitor their movements and
make sure civil aviation is not at risk.

Brought together, the current Russian threat is both credible and highly
unpredictable, which is a dangerous combination.

What are the sorts of Russian ships and submarines that pose a threat to
these links though and why are they seen as such a challenge? The
Russian fleet of today is a far cry from its Soviet-era highs when it
was one of the largest navies in the world, but it is also a long way
from the post-1991 lows as well.

The modern Russian navy comprises a mixture of newer ships, built in the
last few years and some residual Cold War era vessels. The key threat to
UK interests comes primarily from the Russian Northern Fleet, which is
based in Murmansk.

The fleet comprises one very elderly aircraft carrier - the Admiral
Kuznetsov - which has not been to sea for nearly five years and
following fires onboard and refit challenges, is likely to be in a poor
material state. While she may not sail again, she is likely to remain in
commission as a source of national pride to the Russian navy.

Instead, the biggest surface threat realistically comes from the Kirov
class battlecruiser \'Peter the Great\', a large surface warship
equipped with a wide range of anti-ship and air defence missiles. Used
in a flagship role, she is one of the largest and most capable surface
warships in the world.

Additionally, there is a single \'Slava\' class heavy cruiser - Marshall
Ustinov - intended for anti-shipping operations, which is now nearly 40
years old. The Ustinov has been used in a variety of operations,
particularly off Syria and working with the Russian aircraft carrier
group.

Supporting her are several relatively elderly Udaloy and Sovremenny
class destroyers. These ships were built in the Cold War and are
increasingly elderly. The role of both classes is to threaten Western
submarines and to pose an anti-shipping threat to western warships.
Reporting suggests that around three to five of these ships are in the
Northern Fleet in various states of readiness.

These vessels are slowly being replaced by the Admiral Gorshkov class of
frigates, which have been entering service in recent years. These ships,
which were first laid down in the mid-2000s and launched in 2010, only
entered service in 2018. Although at least 15 are planned, only two have
entered service, with a further one reportedly on sea trials.

These ships are intended to provide ASW protection for Russian ships,
but with only two in service, it highlights a potential gap in Russian
capability. In times of tension or conflict, they would not have enough
modern ships to both tackle Western submarines and protect their own
submarine operating areas. In theory, in years to come the Northern
fleet is likely to have four of these ships assigned to it, forming the
core of its major surface combatant force likely to go into the
Atlantic.

For the Royal Navy, the key threat that these surface ships pose in
peacetime is their ability to conduct intelligence collection and
tracking of UK military assets. As was seen in [the Warship TV
show](https://www.forces.net/news/russian-navy-captain-warns-royal-navy-frigate-back-stand-sea),
the Russian Navy has deployed Udaloy class escorts off the coast of
Scotland to try to conduct intelligence gathering operations near
Faslane, home of the Royal Navy SSBN force.

Perhaps the most potent military threat to British interests in the
Atlantic comes from Russian submarine forces in the Northern Fleet,
which are both numerous and capable. Like the Royal Navy, the Northern
Fleet has SSBNs, including older cold war designs like the Typhoon and
Delta class submarines, as well as the newer Borei class. In total there
are about six SSBNs assigned to the Northern Fleet.

There are a significant number of nuclear attack submarines, including
older cold war designs like the Victor, Sierra and the newer Akula
class. It is likely that there are about 10 to 12 SSNs in the force,
although they are at varying levels of readiness and availability.

The two big contrasts with the Royal Navy is that the Northern Fleet
also has several big nuclear submarines like the Oscar and Yansen class,
which carry large numbers of cruise missiles. The Russians have used the
Oscar class to attack NATO aircraft carrier groups and the submarines
are intended to find and sink carrier groups using heavy anti-ship
missiles -- initially 24 \'Shipwreck\' missiles, with modernised
variants carrying up to 72 Kalibr missiles.

[[The Royal Navy]{.underline} [scrapped]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[diesel]{.underline} [submarine]{.underline}]{.mark}
[force]{.underline} in the mid-1990s [and has since]{.underline} [then
relied on an entirely nuclear-powered submarine flotilla.]{.underline}
By contrast, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russian
[Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[continues to make use of the Kilo and
Lada]{.underline}]{.mark}** [class]{.underline} [to conduct a range of
missions]{.underline} [and these remain]{.underline} [capable vessels
able to operate in a range of operations, particularly in shallower
waters where nuclear]{.underline} [submarines (which are larger), **[may
be more restricted]{.mark}** in their ability to
manoeuvre. ]{.underline}

In addition to the more traditional surface warships and submarines,
[[the]{.underline} [Northern Fleet]{.underline}]{.mark} [also **[has
access to a variety of special operations and intelligence gathering
vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including submarines and specialist
surface ships. [[These]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [used]{.mark} **[to carry
out covert operations,]{.mark}**]{.underline} which can include
collecting intelligence, tapping cables or other discrete operations. 

These ships can pose a credible threat to British and wider NATO
military operations and security by their ability to monitor movements,
intercept communication traffic and conduct wider intelligence-gathering
operations. This means that monitoring and tracking them is vital to
ensure that they do not pose a clear threat to western military
operations. 

How then does the UK respond to the threat posed by Russian forces? The
Royal Navy and Royal Air Force can respond using a variety of different
platforms in UK waters, as well as working with NATO more widely. 

From an international perspective, one of the most effective ways of
tracking and deterring Russian activity is through NATO. The alliance
has a series of well-tried and tested collaborative agreements to enable
the tracking and monitoring of Russian warships and aircraft, which
means that [[the UK]{.underline}]{.mark} (and NATO) generally [[have a
very good idea]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[of their
location]{.underline}]{.mark}** and can react accordingly.  

This could include providing close-in escorts to ships sailing close to
NATO member states areas of interest or carrying out aerial
surveillance. Alternatively, it enables NATO navies to consider their
planned operations and ship movements and if needs be, move or delay
them to avoid encountering Russian vessels. 

The Senior Service has a range of ship types able to counter the Russian
threat. Most Royal Navy surface ships can, and have, been used to escort
Russian vessels when in UK waters of interest to monitor and track their
activity. 

The most commonly used ships include the River-class offshore patrol
vessels, which are used for a lot of different maritime surveillance
tasks, from fishery protection to escorting Russian ships. Although
lightly armed, they are ideal for keeping station with Russian vessels
passing through the Channel, or other areas and monitoring their
activity and behaviour. 

Although Type 45 destroyers are sometimes used to escort ships, the main
Royal Navy escort vessel used to track and monitor the Russian threat is
the Type 23 frigate. This ship class, which forms the bulk of the Royal
Navy\'s surface fleet, has eight ships with \'towed array sonar\' which
is a sonar that can be trailed behind the ship to listen passively for
submarines in the area.  

The Type 23 force, like HMS Northumberland in the Warship TV series, are
intended to track and in wartime, destroy enemy submarines. They are
extremely capable at this task, as they are fitted with a wide range of
sensors, including sonars, and highly capable radars to track both
submarines and surface ships. 

They also carry a wide range of weapons including a 4.5\"-gun,
anti-aircraft missiles and stingray torpedoes. They also deploy with a
Merlin helicopter, one of the most capable large ASW helicopters in the
world, which can be used to track submarines some distance from the ship
and monitor their activity. 

These ships are regularly deployed on operations to monitor Russian
activity, often in a range of sensitive waters far from home. It is
notable that even though practically nothing is said about what they are
doing there, many Type 23s in recent years have deployed north of the
Arctic circle and returned home with \'blue noses\' to indicate a
deployment into the far north. 

These ships have been in service for many years now and although
extensively modernised, are clearly beginning to age. Their replacements
are already under construction, with the Type 26 frigate, nearly twice
the size of the Type 23, now being built in Glasgow, with the first due
to be launched within the next year. 

The Type 26 will be an extremely capable ASW platform, representing new
technology and sensors and being able to tackle the threat by the next
generation of Russian submarines. The design has been sold to Australia
and Canada, who are also building them and in turn, it may yet be sold
elsewhere. The Royal Navy has an exceptional platform for the future of
ASW operations with the Type 26. 

Under the water, the UK response is likely to come from one of its
fearsome Astute class submarines. The hugely advanced nuclear-powered
attack submarines are well equipped to track and monitor Russian surface
and submarine activity. 

Their role is to monitor shipping, conduct intelligence gathering and
also protect Royal Navy SSBNs on patrol. One of their key roles is to be
deployed out to monitor and if needs be, pose a real tactical threat to
Russian nuclear attack submarines that are getting too close to UK areas
of critical national interest. 

Although little is publicly said of their work, it is safe to assume
that wherever there are risks from Russian submarines to UK interests,
be they SSBNs or cables, a Royal Navy SSN is almost certainly on the
case to protect them. 

Above the sea, the Royal Air Force is also able to help monitor events
through its newly introduced P8 force. These maritime patrol aircraft,
which have replaced the Nimrod, are based at RAF Lossiemouth and are
used as long-range maritime patrol surveillance aircraft, capable of
monitoring shipping movements, tracking activity and also carrying out
ASW work. 

Equipped with capable submarine detection systems and Mk46 torpedoes,
the P8 is a hugely capable addition to the RAF that is intended to
provide a very potent long-distance ASW capability. It will be used to
track hostile submarines at some distance from home, tracking their
activity and if needs be, working with Merlin helicopters and Type 23
frigates to provide a comprehensive defence that can tackle any
submarine threat.  The result is a highly capable integrated force that
can work exceptionally well together, able to tackle a wide range of
challenges posed by the modern Russian Navy. 

Overall then, although the Russian Navy does pose a meaningful and
credible threat to UK interests and has, over the years, quietly
equipped itself with some capable new technology, it is also fair to say
that the UK has not been resting on its laurels either. 

[What this means is]{.underline} that even **[[if the Russian Navy
does]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[want to threaten
cables]{.underline}]{.mark}** of interest, or try to track the Royal
Navy SSBN force, **[[it will find itself matched against an equally

[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[any]{.underline}]{.mark} potential **[[threat is properly

The result is that although [Russia]{.underline} can and does, deploy
[ships and submarines]{.underline} to pose a challenge to UK operations
in highly sensitive waters, **[it is always tracked, monitored, and
deterred by the highly capable British Armed Force]{.underline}**s,
**[who are able to act in a professional manner

these documents is on managing the large flow if data from future
platforms, and within the bureaucracy ofthe organization itself, a
summary of the status and future plans for ASW-specific platforms and
their potential to utilize ML follows.

Aircraft

Having just reached Interim Operational Capability in 2018 and projected
to be fully operationally capable in 2025, the CH-148 Cyclone is
Canada\'s newest ASW platform. The standard crew for the Cyclone is two
pilots, one ACSO TACCO, and a single Sensor Operator responsible for a
number Of leading-edge sensors, including passive acoustics and the
HELRAS active SONAR, claimed to be the \"highest-performance helicopter
dipping SONAR in the world.\"227 Ifthe advertised performance Of Other
modern equivalents is accurate, this could entail an increase in
\"detection ranges from three to seven times that oflegacy systems.
\"228 The SONAR is also claimed to be interoperable \"with shipboard
SONARs and sonobuoys in bistatic or multistatic employment.\"229 The
adoption ofrv1L algorithms to optimally process passive and active
SONARs, in particular multi-static operations, would augment the
capability of the single sensor operator and would arguably optimize
fusion Of data with and from other platforms. The CP-140 Aurora, in
service since 1980, has undergone numerous upgrades to modernize its
sensor suite and has received modifications to extend its service life
until 2030.230 Canada\'s project to replace the Aurora is in the very
early stages and no Statement of Requirements exists yet, but SSE
specifically mentions recapitalization Of the CP-140 fleet.231 Given
that Canada has signed on to the NATO M3A forum, it can be assumed that
any replacement for the Aurora will have similar requirements to those
outlined for M3A elsewhere in this paper.232 As previously discussed,
these requirements do not specifically refer to Al or ML systems on
board, but do extensively mention advances in sensors and computer
processing capability. For human operators, the challenge Of dealing
with the volume of information being generated by the current version Of
the CP-140 will only increase with the adoption of the latest block of
upgrades, and will certainly be a consideration with any replacement
platform. While tactics are continually being developed to account for
\"the volume of information now being generated by the sensor systems\"
Of the upgraded CP-140, human operators could become a limiting factor
on what current or future Canadian ASW aircraft can achieve, given the
untapped potential of the systems on board.233 the addition of computing
equipment. If, however, the two entire crew stations for Acoustic Sensor
Operators were to be removed entirely, including desk space, monitors,
chairs and the protective equipment for the operators, along with not
having two or more operators on board each mission, hundreds Of
kilograms and several square meters could be freed up, which would
likely be necessary given the size and space requirements for the
computing power that would be required. On a next-generation platform,
these considerations could be made while the platform is being designed,
either for a new build or to be easily retrofitted once a system is
ready, so that power, weight, balance and centre Of gravity challenges
could be avoided.

[Halifax Class Frigate]{.underline}

The Halifax-class frigates have been in service with the RCN since 1992
and have gone through a modernization project which included upgrades to
systems, addition of new capabilities and extended the service life Out
until the delivery Of the next generation Of ships.2 They
**[[are]{.mark} \"[multi-purpose platforms]{.mark}]{.underline}**\"
[[designed]{.mark} and built]{.underline} [in the latter
stages]{.underline} Of the Cold War, [with an emphasis on
ASW]{.underline}, [[to]{.mark} \"[operate]{.mark} **[in the Northern
Atlantic]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[and find Soviet nuclear
submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"235 [The ships\' ASW
systems]{.underline} [are being upgraded]{.underline} through the
Underwater Warfare Suite Upgrade (UWSU), which includes a new Towed
Array SONAR, Hull Mounted SONARs and the Torpedo SONAR Intercept &
Classification system, [which can detect SONAR]{.underline} [from enemy
torpedoes]{.underline}, **[[and \"offer unique capabilities and world
leading performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"236 The improved sensors
and SONARs \'Swill be able to detect quieter targets at increased ranges
providing the greatest possible detection capability to protect ships
from underwater threats,\" which \"[increases the window operators and
command teams have for decision making]{.underline}.\"237 This system,
while highly advanced, still relies on human sensor operators to
interpret the incoming information. As discussed throughout this paper,
**[[integration of ML systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** with capable
sensors **[[could allow optimum performance]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
ASW scenarios.

Canadian Surface Combatant

The Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) will be the replacement for the
Halifax Class, with deliveries planned beginning in the mid 2020s and
continuing until the late 2040s.238 [The Type 26 design will feature an
\"**acoustically quiet hull**,\" and \"an **advanced SONAR
system**]{.underline} [with a towed array system **for tracking
submarines**]{.underline}.\"239 Beyond these details, not much is known
about its planned sensor systems, except that the RCN has explicitly
stated that it is \'Snot pursuing any Al that is connected to employing
weapon systems.\"240 This paper has argued throughout that [[ML]{.mark}
[should be used]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to provide
decision-makers]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[with high quality
information]{.underline}]{.mark}** to inform tactical decisions. With
the capability of sensors that will exist by the time the final ships
are delivered and the rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning, it seems certain that the CSC will incorporate ML for
sensor operation at some point in its lifespan, but to what degree, and
when, is yet to be determined. As a central ASW platform,
**[[interoperability with allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and future
aircraft [[will be]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and foresight and significant
planning]{.underline} will need to SSE identifies the Victoria-Class
submarines (VCS) as a key element of maritime domain awareness, through
their sub-surface surveillance role, and highlights the importance of
their role in sovereignty operations and continental defence.241 The
four submarines, which were brought into service by Canada beginning in
2000, were scheduled to reach their end Of service lives beginning in
2022, but will now undergo an incremental modernization programme,
\"[[which will ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[their continued
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}** Out to the mid-2030s.\"242 The VCS
acoustic sensors include an active/passive bow SONAR, a towed array
system and a flank array, which is slated for upgrade in the Victoria
Class Modernization Program, in order to achieve \"better detection and
performance.\"24 It is unlikely that ML is being considered for addition
to the upgraded systems, given the position Of the RCN against
incorporating Al, but as with the next generation Of surface ships, [[it
may be essential]{.mark} [to further improve]{.mark} the **[operating
capacity]{.mark}** [of the SONAR systems]{.mark} and manage the amount
Of information [generated on board]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Shore-Based SONAR Ops and AES Ops are also employed in acoustic analysis
roles at the Naval Ocean Processing Facility (NOPF) at Whidbey Island,
in the U.S., at the Acoustic Data Analysis Centre (ADAC) department Of
the Trinity Naval Intelligence unit in Halifax? and at Acoustic Sensor
Analysis (ASA) sections on maritime helicopter and long range patrol
home Wings. At NOPF Whidbey Island, the 30 CAF personnel assist in
providing \"timely and accurate acoustic cueing to operating and
supporting forces, and conduct continuous maritime surveillance,\" by
analyzing information from either the five Surveillance Towed Array
Sensor System (SURTASS) ships, which operate a towed hydrophone array
over 8,000 feet long, or working on the operations watch floor, which
monitors a network Of fixed arrays. At ADAC and ASA, they analyze
recorded acoustic information from operational platforms to derive
acoustic intelligence and assess submarine and Other contact encountered
by operators, which is then fed back into intelligence and training
products and debriefs to crews to prepare them for follow-on missions.
In any of these positions, incorporation ofML to analyze the extensive
acoustic data coming in to the facilities would significantly expand the
capability ofthese organizations to increase their outputs in terms of
tactical advice and intelligence products to higher command and the
on-platform operators.

Latvia. These forces have come primarily from the United States, United
Kingdom and Germany.

All three wanted a permanent beefed-up presence for eastern Europe on
the NATO agenda for June's meeting in Madrid. Having a long history of
Russian occupation following World War II, the three were admitted in
2004 to the alliance.

Karis said, "[[there was no alternative]{.underline}"
**[then]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[to joining for mutual
security]{.underline}]{.mark},** and "no alternative now."

Madrid will be "where concrete decisions will be made" on permanent
forward stationing is made, Levits added.

Nauseda said [[increased NATO presence]{.mark} to the Baltic states also
**[means moving in advanced systems]{.mark}** and other equipment,
[especially]{.mark} air and missile [**defense weapons** to the Baltic
states]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as more air and ground forces. For
Lithuania's part, it has already increased its spending on security and
has begun improving infrastructure to better facilitate the movement of
NATO forces and equipment to his nation and stationing there.

With the Russian invasion stalemated in Ukraine, the possibility of
Moscow using chemical or biological weapons or tactical nuclear weapons
to get its way "would change the situation completely" of NATO's
response, Levits said.

Nauseda added, "in recent weeks, Russia has crossed so many red lines"
by invading Ukraine, "NATO should be very decisive in its response" if
weapons of mass destruction were employed. Without spelling out an exact
alliance response, Nauseda said military options should be on the table
in that case.

Karis said the Kremlin's use of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine
could drive long-time alliance partners Finland and Sweden to seek NATO
membership.

On imposing a "no-fly zone" over all or parts of Ukraine, the presidents
said that decision would have to rest with nations capable of carrying
out such a mission. Options like a no-fly zone "must be credible,"
Nauseda said, and should be aimed at not provoking a Russian escalation.

He suggested no-fly zones around nuclear plants and facilities as a
possibility.

As to how the conflict will end, Karis said it cannot end at any price.
"I would be very cautious" about negotiations with the Kremlin now, he
said.

Levits added, "the territory of Ukraine \[must be\] restored," its
security stable and the "the Russians should go back."

The Lithuanian president saw the American and European Union sanctions
working in not only hitting Russian oligarchs but reaching its middle
class. The pressure, he said, is being felt in Moscow's financial sector
and its exporting of strategic materials and energy, its prime source of
foreign revenue. He wanted the United States and Europe to look at means
to close any loopholes that Moscow is using to get around the sanctions,
"namely China."

[The three said their]{.underline} nations are moving
[rapidly]{.underline} to reduce their energy dependence on Russian
supplies. To fill the gap, the three presidents are looking to the
United States for liquified natural gas shipments to meet their future
needs.

But "the worse thing that can happen is a frozen conflict" in Ukraine,
Karis said, where refugees are left homeless for years.

"We are seeing millions and millions of refugees" fleeing to Moldova,
Poland and other eastern [[European nations]{.underline}]{.mark}, he
said. "They **[[have to be integrated"]{.underline}]{.mark}** into the
societies where they have sought refuge. He added the impact on those
nations will be felt in their school and medical systems and the need to
provide humanitarian assistance.

The [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} [troop [buildup]{.mark}]{.underline}
on the Ukrainian border and [in the]{.underline} heavily militarized
[Black Sea region]{.underline} has [**[led to calls]{.mark}** by Black

Russian [efforts]{.mark} **[to divide]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[isolate]{.mark}** some of the [alliance]{.mark}'s newest
[members]{.mark}.]{.underline}

With over 100,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine on three sides and
activity consistent with combat preparation, the Biden administration
has opted to pursue diplomacy with Russia following a Dec. 7 virtual
summit between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But NATO allies who are members of the Bucharest Nine (B9) group of
eastern flank nations have indicated to Biden and National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan on a Dec. 16 call that more American presence is
needed now to deter an invasion of Ukraine.

"[If the U.S. and NATO are not careful, the Black Sea will be a Russian
lake]{.underline}," Romanian military attaché in Washington, D.C., Col.
Catalin-Constantin Mihalache told Air Force Magazine, noting how Russia
has increased and modernized its Western region forces.

"[[The goal]{.mark} in the Black Sea]{.underline} **[[is to isolate NATO
regional partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Georgia and Ukraine, by
[[taking advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} the [lack of
strategic]{.mark} and comprehensive **[day-to-day]{.mark}**
[NATO]{.mark} [presence and strategy]{.mark},"]{.underline} he added.

Following a Dec. 10 B9 call with Biden, Romanian President Klaus
Iohannis [took to
Twitter ](https://twitter.com/KlausIohannis?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)to
highlight the case he made to Biden.

"I ... underlined \[Romanian\] support for an increased NATO & US
military presence in #Romania & at the #BlackSea," he wrote.

Mihalache said the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a national security
concern for Romania and NATO. Russian-occupied Crimea, which has become
a heavily militarized anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bastion in the
Black Sea since annexation in 2014, is just 200 miles from Romania's
shores.

"It's closing the distance," he said of a potential further Russian
incursion of Ukraine. "Russia will approach not only Romania but will be
close to the NATO border."

An Oct. 27 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Black Sea
security detailed an uneven NATO policy of enhanced forward presence in
the Baltic nations and tailored forward presence in southeastern Europe.
Experts suggested that directing more robust assistance to the north led
Russia to concentrate its aggression in the south. Romania established a
NATO Multinational Corps South-East headquarters in Sibiu in part to
encourage an increase in allied presence.

"We are very determined to build our capability and to have NATO and the
U.S. join us in this effort and support us," Mihalache said, noting that
Romania also awaits a decision about global force posture that could
lead to additional U.S. troops in the country. About 1,000 U.S. troops
are present at any given time in Romania.

In his role as the air attaché, the Romanian official highlighted the
importance of the NATO Black Sea posture and current cooperation with
the U.S.

"The air domain is key for the credibility and effectiveness of the
allied regional collective posture," Mihalache explained. "The U.S.
presence and persistent contribution of ISR and situational awareness is
making the allied regional progress."

The U.S. [began basing MQ-9
Reapers](https://www.airforcemag.com/mq-9s-in-romania-provide-constant-isr-over-the-balkans/) at
Romanian Air Base 71 in Campia Turzii in January. Romania maintains a
small Air Force of F-16s and Soviet-era MiG-21s upgraded with Israeli
technology. Romania also benefits from NATO air policing.

Mihalache said Romania's Air Force plans a purchase of two squadrons of
F-16s from Norway that will eventually replace the MiG-21s.

Romania also has the first Patriot missile defense system on the eastern
flank. Some of the seven batteries contracted are operational, while
others have yet to arrive.

Mihalache highlighted the recent presence of an American bomber task
force supported by Romanian F-16s.

U.S. Pursues Diplomacy, Holds Back Military Aid for Now

A senior administration official briefing reporters Dec. 17 said the
2014 Minsk negotiations, which led to a quieting of hostilities with
Russian-backed separatists in southeastern Ukraine, are the principal
format the U.S. is advocating for to resolve the crisis on the border.

"But the U.S. is prepared to use our bilateral channels to Moscow and to
Kyiv to support, if we can," the official said.

In recent days, State Department officials have visited Moscow to
entertain Russian proposals for moving forward. In the past, Putin has
said Ukraine or Georgia entry into NATO is a red line, and he has
discouraged military assistance to the countries.

Members of Congress have nonetheless urged Biden to answer a [November
request from
Ukraine](https://www.airforcemag.com/ukraine-requests-new-defense-assistance-amid-increased-tensions-with-russia/) for
additional military assistance, including air defenses that the country
says are necessary to deter a Russian invasion. A [Ukrainian defense
official recently
told ](https://www.airforcemag.com/ukraine-says-it-can-deter-a-russian-invasion-with-air-defense-nato-calls-for-adjustments/)Air
Force Magazine that an American [air defense team was in the
country](https://www.airforcemag.com/with-russia-on-multiple-fronts-dod-team-in-ukraine-assesses-air-defense-needs/) to
assess needs, but no announcement of new assistance has been made.

"We are also in intensive dialogue with the Ukrainians at all levels,
including DOD and EUCOM \[U.S. European Command\], with regard to their
needs," the administration official said, adding that the conversation
included allies who may be able to offer defense assistance. "We will
continue to keep those lines open as necessary and as we see what the
Ukrainian requirements are."\
\
In a Dec. 16 congressional hearing titled "Defending Ukraine, Deterring
Putin," Andrew Bowen, an analyst in Russian and European affairs at the
Congressional Research Service, identified the U.S. NATO Black Sea
presence as the rationale for Russia's hostility.

"Russian political and military leaders assert that the increased
expansion of NATO and the presence of ... European and U.S. military
forces on its border and Black Sea are an existential security threat to
Russia," he said.

Bowen said the leaders are concerned that NATO and U.S. military forces
will eventually place long-range precision strike missile defense
systems nearby. Romania already has a High Mobility Artillery Rocket
System (HIMARS), a light multiple rocket launcher.

The defense official also said the southeastern flank needs better
investment in command-and-control capabilities and access to satellite
reconnaissance data. Adding the capabilities to the southeastern flank,
he argued, would make protection and deterrence at the eastern border of
NATO more uniform.

"[[The]{.mark} [allied]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[needs to be firm and
credible]{.mark}** and [requires]{.mark} **[united]{.mark}** and
**[coherent]{.mark}** deterrent [efforts to the **entire**
flank]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

"This is an unprecedented challenge in the post-Cold War because we
didn't have such an escalation since the end of the Cold War," Mihalache
continued. **["It requires our allied and U.S. immediate reaction and
attention."]{.underline}**

**Marine Domain awareness HAS to be unified -- information-sharing is
only possible through a unified presence.**

[[To deny Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} initiative in
[shaping]{.underline} the security landscape [of the Baltic
Sea]{.underline}, [[Allies and partners]{.mark}
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[build
comprehensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[maritime
security]{.underline}]{.mark} [by]{.underline}
**[integrating]{.underline}** [their]{.underline} [maritime]{.underline}
law enforcement and [naval]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}.
[[This requires]{.underline} **[shared]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[maritime
domain]{.underline}]{.mark} [[awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}.83 Since
2006, the Sea Surveillance Co-operation Finland-Sweden interface enables
Finland and Sweden to exchange classified target information, up to and
including secret, in the Baltic Sea. The unclassified Sea Surveillance
Co-operation Baltic States and the European Union's Maritime
Surveillance Networking further promote Baltic Sea security.84 Finland
and Sweden have lead roles in both. However, regional maritime
information-sharing could be improved. By [[implementing a **multilevel
information**]{.mark} **[architecture]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [armed
forces of NATO]{.underline} [members]{.underline} and partners
[[could]{.mark} [share]{.mark} [classified
information]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of the]{.mark} **[entire conflict
spectrum]{.mark},** while providing user-defined, unclassified,
operational pictures suitable for their law enforcement
agencies.85]{.underline}

To counter Russian pursuit of hybrid warfare aimed at destabilizing its
neighbors in the BSR by measures short of clear-cut military action,
active patrols by maritime law enforcement and naval vessels are
instrumental to remain left of bang. Information-gathering and
dissemination during patrols would improve shared maritime domain
awareness. In contrast to China's modus operandi in the South China Sea,
Russia has solely used military assets to harass its neighbors' maritime
exploration activities.86 Notwithstanding, both violate international
law as laid down in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea. To avoid escalation, maritime law enforcement agencies should
continue to enforce maritime law, but their crews may require naval
support if challenged by the Baltic Fleet. Finland and Sweden have noted
the need for improved interagency coordination in their Total Defense
concepts. The need for such coordination is apparent also on a regional
scale.

To hold Russia accountable for unlawful or hostile actions under the
threshold that would trigger invocation of a NATO Article 5 response,
[coordinated]{.underline} [strategic communication]{.underline} [on a
regional basis]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [leverage efforts made
by individual]{.underline} [states]{.underline}. Diplomatic signaling
and show of force by patrols by U.S. Navy and standing NATO maritime
forces are instrumental to deter Russian military aggression at sea,
since capability and resolve to respond to Russian escalation in the BSR
are prerequisites for a deterrence-by-denial strategy. [NATO must
coordinate such measures]{.underline} [with Finland and
Sweden,]{.underline} [which both possess territories and capabilities
critical to staging an allied intervention in the region.]{.underline}

In 2019 there are four more nuclear powers (India, Pakistan, Israel and
North Korea) each of which has its own concerns and ambitions. [Iran is
probably close to having nuclear weapons]{.underline}, reportedly with
extensive North Korean help. It seems likely [that within a
decade]{.underline}, [and probably a good deal sooner, Japan will have
nuclear weapons]{.underline} as a deterrent against North Korea and, to
a lesser extent, China. [South Korea will quite possibly develop weapons
of its own to deter]{.underline} the North Koreans and possibly also to
threaten Japan. We now know that during the 1970s Taiwan had a very
active bomb program (which the US derailed) and it may well return.
There are also other potential candidates. Saudi Arabia, for example,
has long been a rival of Iran for primacy in the Islamic world. The
Saudis once bought Chinese intermediate-range ballistic missiles
(presumably as a threat to Iran) and for many years the Saudis
underwrote the Pakistani military in return for a pledge of support in
an emergency. Such [nuclear proliferation has a twofold bearing on the
submarine problem]{.underline}. First, some of these [countries will
deploy secure deterrents in the form of submarines]{.underline}. Imagine
[the impact of a much more numerous multinational submarine
force]{.underline} on a 'transparent ocean' system. [The systems
typically envisaged would operate from space]{.underline} and would be
able **[to detect submarines but would have little or no ability to
distinguish one submarine from another]{.underline}**. [The larger the
number of submarines operating at sea]{.underline}, **[the better the
chance that a space-based]{.underline}** (or, for that matter high
altitude) **[ocean surveillance system]{.underline}** **[would pick up
non-targets]{.underline}**. It would be embarrassing enough if the
attack triggered by such a system failed to destroy some of its targets.
It would be a lot worse if it targeted the wrong submarines. Their
destruction would warn the real targets and might trigger an attack
before they could be destroyed.

land, sea, air]{.underline}, [and space applications]{.underline} that
would put U.S. forces far ahead of any potential adversaries.

Officials of the [U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency]{.underline} (**[[DARPA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) in Arlington,
Va., [[issued]{.underline} [a broad agency
announcement]{.underline}]{.mark} last week (HR001121S0029) for another

(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**)](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/14206127/artificial-intelligence-ai-share-experiences-machine-learning) [[and
machine automation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Potential [U.S. adversaries]{.underline} **[such as Russia and
China]{.underline}** [have developed]{.underline} [ways to counter
today\'s]{.underline} [U.S. military systems]{.underline} that are built
around exquisite, monolithic integrated systems. Instead, DARPA
researchers want to develop revolutionary system architectures that are
separate, dispersed, disruptive, and that instill doubt in U.S.
adversaries.

[[DARPA]{.mark} [experts]{.mark}]{.underline} [[want to]{.mark} identify
promising]{.underline} [technologies and **[move]{.mark} them [quickly
to the next phase]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}esearch [and]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}evelopment**]{.underline}. Technologies should improve
resilience, responsiveness, range, lethality, access, endurance, and
affordability to enable new joint force warfighting concepts. Many of
these technologies rely on AI and [machine
autonomy](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/14277721/artificial-intelligence-ai-machine-autonomy-command-and-control).

For aircraft, researchers point out that traditional stealth
technologies are approaching their limits, and that potential
adversaries have developed several different countermeasures to U.S.
stealth aircraft technologies.

Moreover, DARPA officials say [[they are interested
in]{.mark}]{.underline} systems to counter the proliferation of advanced
integrated air defense systems (IADS), including extremely capable
surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles.

DARPA also is interested in aircraft-related enabling technologies that:

\-- enable next generation unmanned aerial systems;\
\-- use distributed, disaggregated systems to reduce reliance on small
numbers of exquisite platforms;\
\-- enable timely delivery of targeting data and tactical targeting;

\-- enable aircraft capabilities that previously have not been
exploited;\
\-- enable levels of machine autonomy that can minimize the risk to
human warfighters, and make platforms more attritable, and allow piloted
and autonomous systems to operate in concert; and\
\-- enable development and fielding systems more rapidly, such as
model-based systems engineering, multi-dimensional optimization, and
additive manufacturing.

For ground systems, DARPA researchers are interested in enabling
technologies that:

\-- coordinate and plan in the presence of adversaries with limited
knowledge of the environment, can handle battlefield surprises, and
adapt to new events;\
\-- protect soldiers, and extend the warfighter\'s range;\
\-- amplify effects, and reconfigure to account for attrition;\
\-- help develop autonomous systems that operating quickly;\
\-- incorporate advances in machine autonomy for integrated manned and
unmanned ground operations;\
\-- provide small units or individual warfighters with improved mobility
and lethality; and\
\-- expand the ability for ground forces to deal with air threats,
operate inside the interiors of buildings, and use natural and pre-dug
subterranean environments.

For maritime systems, DARPA researchers are interested in enabling
technologies that:

\-- enable a dispersed system-of-systems architecture that complicates
an adversary\'s plans by reducing warfighting reliance on monolithic,
high-value surface and sub-surface assets;\
\-- organically defeat raids of sea-skimming high-speed missiles;\
\-- counter **[[advanced sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, sea
mines, **[and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs)]{.underline}**, and
defeat advanced torpedoes;\
\-- mature ways to protect U.S. waterways and port facilities;\
\-- provide a persistent presence in harsh environments such as the
arctic, to include long-duration, minimum maintenance, and safe
navigation;\
\-- disperse and disaggregate maritime assets using small, inexpensive,
networked vessels with in AI and machine autonomy; and\
\-- capitalize the undersea domain to impose doubt on adversaries by
projecting power into all other domains.

For space systems, DARPA is interested in enabling technologies that:

\-- complicate an adversary\'s counter-space capabilities by reducing
warfighting reliance on monolithic, long lead-time, high-value space
assets and instruments;

\-- counter emerging threats in a contested space environment;\
\-- reduce reliance on large, expensive, and increasingly vulnerable
geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) satellites;\
\-- exploit AI and deep learning technologies evaluate data from many
satellites, and create dynamic kill chains; and\
\-- advance material science, manufacturing, and computational
techniques to reduce the size, weight, and costs.

each other. They also have a reason to avoid an arms race that would
entail constantly seeking more nuclear weapons to try to achieve
superiority---however temporary. As expensive as nuclear weapons and
their delivery vehicles are, [parity has kept the costs down by holding
the arms race in check.]{.underline} In the past few years, President
Vladimir Putin does seem to be after nuclear weapons for another
reason---to show that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is still a great
power to be reckoned with. [He [has been trumpeting new]{.mark} and
exotic systems that are [unique]{.mark}, like the [nuclear weapon
delivery system]{.mark} known as the Burevestnik nuclear-propelled
cruise missile.]{.underline} These exotic systems have more of a
political function than a strategic or security one. [Their [role is to
signal Russia's]{.mark} [continuing scientific and military
prowess]{.mark} at a time when the country does not otherwise have much
on offer.]{.underline} Devilishly expensive and sometimes dangerous to
operate, they are unlikely to be deployed in big numbers, as a 2019
fatal testing accident of the Burevestnik shows. If U.S.-Russian arms
control remains in place, such systems definitely will not be deployed
in big numbers, because they would displace proven and highly reliable
intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Russian force structure.
These ballistic missiles are the backbone of nuclear deterrence for
Russia. The exotics don't add to that deterrent. They have some show-off
value, but they will do no more than make the rubble bounce. WHAT ARE
EUROPEAN CONCERNS WITH RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR WEAPON MODERNIZATION? The
Europeans, most prominently [the [NATO allies, are]{.mark} very
[concerned about Russia's nuclear modernization]{.mark}
programs]{.underline}. Their concerns revolve more around new nuclear
missiles to be deployed on European soil than the intercontinental
systems that threaten the United States[. [Poland and
Lithuania]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, are NATO countries
[[border]{.mark}ing [Kaliningrad]{.mark}]{.underline}, a Russian enclave
in the heart of NATO territory. **[[Russia has put increasingly capable
missiles there]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [including the Iskander, a highly
accurate modern missile that is capable [of launching]{.mark} either
**[nuclear]{.mark}** or conventional [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}. .
Likewise, the [Europeans]{.underline} are of one mind about the [threat
posed by]{.underline} a missile known as the 9M729 (SSC-8 in NATO
parlance), which is [an intermediate-range ground-launched cruise
[missile]{.mark} that the Russians developed and deployed in violation
of the]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
([INF]{.underline}) [Treaty]{.underline}. The allies all agree that this
[missile [poses a threat to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Although
it has not been deployed forward in Kaliningrad, [its range is
sufficient to threaten all of NATO]{.underline} Europe when deployed in
European Russia. It too is said to support both nuclear and conventional
weapons. [Since Russia [seized Crimea in 2014]{.mark}, the [Russians
have begun to build up]{.mark} basing [sites]{.mark} for their advanced
systems there]{.underline} too, including the Iskanders. If Russia
brings nuclear weapons into Crimea, it will spark complex political,
legal, and moral problems. The world community has largely held firm in
condemning Russia's seizure of Crimea and considers Crimea to be
Ukrainian territory. Should Russia bring nuclear weapons to Crimea, it
will be violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in a
fundamental manner, for Ukraine is a non-nuclear weapon state under the
NPT. Russia in this case would be behaving in a manner no better than
North Korea.

Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu during a Defense Ministry meeting on

completed]{.mark}]{.underline} the refurbishment of the first rocket
regiment of Avangard rocket systems with [[intercontinental ballistic
missiles]{.mark}, armed with hypersonic gliding cruise
warheads]{.underline}. Two more rocket regiments have been put on duty
equipped with the first Yars rocket systems." One of six new weapons
unveiled by Russian president Vladimir Putin during his 2018
state-of-the-nation address, Avangard is a hypersonic boost-glide
vehicle (HGV) that first entered service in late December 2019. Sources
familiar with a U.S. intelligence assessment of the Avangard program
told CNBC earlier that year that Russia's armed forces are expected to
procure "no more than 60 of these hypersonic weapons" due to prohibitive
production costs. RS-24 Yars, also known as Topol-MR, is a Russian
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system introduced in the late
2000s. Yars is believed to be an advanced development of the older
Topol-M ICBM, conceived in the 1980s and deployed in the years following
the Soviet collapse. Yars is armed with up to six multiple independently
targetable warheads (MIRVs), each reportedly carrying a yield of at
least 300 kilotons. As with its Topol-M predecessor, Yars can be
deployed in both road-mobile and silo-based formats. According to recent
western estimates, Russia's strategic missile forces possess around 140
mobile Yars systems, just over one dozen silo-based Yars units, sixteen
mobile Topol-M systems, sixty silo-based Topol-M systems, and around
forty aging Topol systems that are slated for imminent retirement.
[Russia's defense industry has begun working on a [new ICBM
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, dubbed Kedr, which is [planned to phase out
the country's current and future Yars systems starting in the early
2030s.]{.underline} Shoigu added that the **[[naval and air legs of

military hardware procurements are accompanied by infrastructure
modernization, noting that 690 "high-tech objects were constructed" in
2021. [Putin]{.underline}, who attended the same Defense Ministry
meeting, [echoed Shoigu's positive assessment of Russia's military
modernization]{.underline}. \"The outgoing year was extraordinary just
like the previous 2020," he said. "First and foremost, because of the

‍In launching his "special military operation" and threatening
"consequences... \[like\] you have never seen in your entire history,"
Russia's President, Vladimir [Putin, has openly engaged in nuclear saber
rattling]{.underline}. Noted scholar Caitlin Talmadge has explained that
Putin's nuclear threat was intended as a shield to keep the West out of
Russia's conventional military operations. This textbook Russian
strategy (to threaten nuclear weapons use in order to offset its
conventional inferiority) is aimed at preventing the United States and
NATO's direct involvement. [It]{.underline} also [gravely undermines the
global nuclear **nonproliferation** order]{.underline} [and threatens to
distort several nuclear conventions and security assurances to
non-nuclear armed countries]{.underline}. Putin's aggression towards
[Ukraine sets a dangerous precedent by abrogating a longstanding
convention]{.underline} (The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances)
and [undermining the wider framework of security assurances and
guarantees that]{.underline} nuclear weapons states ([NWS]{.underline})
[offer to]{.underline} non-nuclear weapons states ([NNWS]{.underline}).
The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) represents a grand bargain
between NWS and NNWS, aimed at preserving global peace and security
while preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As an
NPT signatory, Russia has pledged to disavow the use of negative
security assurances: not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons
against NNWS[. Putin's actions undermine the NPT and offer a clear
example of bullying behavior.]{.underline} The theory of nuclear
brinkmanship holds that states exert coercive pressure by taking steps
that raise the risk of confrontation by showing effective resolve and
enhancing their bargaining position, thereby coercing an opponent into
making concessions. [Putin's]{.underline} nuclear toolbox -- founded
upon an 'escalate to de-escalate' [strategy of nuclear threats and
orders to put nuclear deterrent forces on alert - is classic nuclear
brinkmanship aimed at coercing Ukrainian concessions and to keep the
West out]{.underline}. Russian nuclear signaling and escalation is not
new. At the height of the Crimea crisis in 2014, Russia conducted
military exercises to counter nuclear strikes. As Jacek Durklace writes,
an integral part of the Russian approach to conflict is nuclear arms
flexing and backing up the credibility of threats with nuclear messaging
(including threatening statements, bomber flights, and exercises).
However, despite parallels to previous Russian actions, this evolving
Ukraine crisis appears to be different and more dangerous. Moving to
launch readiness signals a lowering of thresholds for use, and
[conducting nuclear exercises in the middle of a crisis is highly
escalatory behavior]{.underline}. On March 1st, [several Russian nuclear
submarines conducted drills in the Barents]{.underline}
[Sea]{.underline} and units of the Strategic Missile Forces dispersed
Yars road mobile intercontinental ballistic missile launchers in forests
to practice secret deployment. While Russia has previously conducted
nuclear exercises amidst a crisis, scholar James Acton raises an
important question concerning whether these strategic systems will
return to their bases or continue to be deployed. If they remain
deployed, [Russia is one step closer to nuclear
preparedness]{.underline}. The use of nuclear-capable cruise missiles
like Kalibr (though considered a part of Russian non-nuclear deterrence
forces) also raises concerns, and the involvement of third-party actors
like Belarus and its offer to host Russian nuclear weapons is further
destabilizing. William Alberque commented on a less noticed change in
Belarus's constitution that would allow Belarus to host nuclear weapons
on its territory for the first time since 1996, overturning efforts of
the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to denuclearize Belarus[. At a
time when the political divide between nuclear 'haves' and 'have-nots'
is growing]{.underline} - especially due to the lack of progress on
implementation of Article VI of the NPT (an NWS commitment towards
global disarmament) [- Russian actions accelerate this growing
divide]{.underline}. NNWS are taking note of the stalling patterns of
NWS and bullying behavior. As countries prepare for the upcoming NPT
Review Conference, the health and longevity of the NPT will continue to
be fiercely debated. [The Ukraine crisis]{.underline} may lead to
several worrying developments. The crisis **[might accelerate NWS'
nuclear modernization]{.underline}**. Several [NWS]{.underline} and
rogue state actors like North Korea [might adopt wrong lessons from the
crisis and further intensify their own reliance on nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [Several countries are likely to expand their
defense spending]{.underline} - a trend highlighted by a recent SIPRI
report, which suggested that [global military expenditure was 7.2
percent higher in 2019 than it was in 2010]{.underline}. In a historic
announcement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to spending \$113
billion on defense in 2022. It will not be surprising if several other
European nations rethink their own security and defense policies in the
face of Russian aggression. In an already brittle security environment
in Europe, security dilemmas are going to increase, [further challenging
the already fragile global nonproliferation order]{.underline}.

The thunderous eruption of Europe\'s worst war in decades has torn
asunder already fissuring relations between the world\'s top two nuclear
powers, Russia and the United States, with nuclear threats being
discussed as never before in the 21st century only days into the
conflict in Ukraine. What comes next, experts and insiders fear, is an
acceleration of the Cold War-era arms race that never truly ended and
soon may enter a new, even more dangerous phase. \"I am deeply concerned
we have arrived at the most dangerous moment in our collective nuclear
history since the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" Joan Rohlfing, president and
chief operating officer of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, told Newsweek.
In fact she said, \"[this is probably a moment as dangerous as the Cuban
Missile Crisis.\"]{.underline} In the 75 years since the U.S. introduced
the world to atomic warfare in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
the standoff between U.S. and Soviet warships in the Caribbean more than

their weapons of mass destruction against one another. NEWSWEEK

SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS \> President Joe Biden has sought to downplay the
likelihood of mounting U.S.-Russia tensions culminating in a nuclear
exchange. Asked by a reporter Monday if the U.S. should be concerned
about the possibility of a nuclear war, the president simply responded,
\"No.\" But recent reports of a new U.S.-Russia military hotline opened
in Europe indicate a growing worry of the potential for direct clashes
between the two powers, by design or miscalculation, as both seek to
flex their strategic deterrence. Matching [Russia\'s own nuclear
actions, the U.S. has flown nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to NATO\'s
eastern flank, a region that has been at the center of the Kremlin\'s
enmity toward the West due to the alliance\'s expansion]{.underline}
since the fall of the Soviet Union 30 years ago. Putin, who has been in
power for two of those past three decades, has also overseen the
collapse of the arms control architecture painstakingly, sometimes
begrudgingly, built by Washington and Moscow throughout the Cold War.
First, the U.S. pulled out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
(ABM) in 2002, early on in Putin\'s tenure and shortly after the 9/11
attacks pivoted Washington\'s attention away from rebuilding U.S.-Russia
relations toward fighting the \"War on Terror\" that continues to this
day. Five years later, Moscow withdrew from the Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE), arguing that the level of restrictions
imposed on Russia no longer made sense in the wake of the USSR-aligned
Warsaw Pact\'s dissolution. The most recent casualty to
non-proliferation efforts was the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
Treaty (INF), scrapped by former President Donald Trump in 2019 after
longstanding U.S. accusations that Russia had violated the accord with
the production of a new missile that breached the 500-5,500-kilometer
ban on ground-based weapons systems. Russia, for its part, argued that
the U.S. was already in violation of the INF with the deployment in
Eastern Europe of missile defense systems that Moscow has argued could
not only neutralize the country\'s own firepower but also be fitted with
offensive weapons. The INF\'s looming death only further pushed Putin to
pursue the development of new nuclear-capable platforms he touted as
\"invincible\" to existing and even prospective defenses. \"They didn\'t
listen to us, so listen to us now,\" Putin proclaimed during his 2018
unveiling of nuclear-capable systems such as the RS-28 Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile, the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide
vehicle, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile,
the 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-power cruise missile and, perhaps the
biggest game-changer of them all, the Poseidon unmanned underwater
torpedo, a weapon believed capable of producing fiery, radioactive waves
across a radius of thousands of square miles. The U.S. has largely
dismissed Russia\'s stated concerns, arguing that NATO was solely a
\"defensive\" alliance, so the continued pursuit of Washington and its
allies of state-of-the-art weapons of their own and even the continued
deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe, meant no offense to
Moscow. But just as the Kremlin watched with wariness at NATO\'s
physical expansion, so too has Russia witnessed a historic rival
coalition broaden its military mandate to include intervention in the
Balkans and Libya. And after unrest first broke out in Ukraine eight
years ago with the ousting of a Moscow-aligned government for one
seeking to join the Western alliance, here too NATO took a larger role
in arming and training Kyiv\'s security forces against a Moscow-backed
separatist insurgency as Russia moved to annex the Crimean Peninsula
amid an internationally disputed referendum. While Rohlfing emphasized
that the U.S. and NATO\'s past actions in no way justified Putin\'s
intervention last week, she acknowledged a need to reflect on how we
arrived at this low point with Moscow. \"At some point when we get out
of this crisis, we\'re going to need to go back and take a careful look
at how could we have done better in listening more closely to Russian
concerns and addressing them rather than continuing to take actions that
they perceived to be a threat to their security interests,\" Rohlfing
said. Michael Krepon, who co-founded the Stimson Center think tank and
previously served in the State Department\'s Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency during the administration of former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter, also saw missteps in the U.S. approach to European
security after the fall of the Soviet Union, errors he felt were now
hard to correct. \"Open-ended NATO expansion was, in my view, an error
in judgment, but once this door was opened, it was hard to close,\"
Krepon told Newsweek. He called the U.S. and NATO decision to consider
Georgia and Ukraine\'s bids to join the alliance during the Bucharest
summit of 2008 a \"supremely bad decision.\" \"That said, Putin would
likely have invaded even if Ukraine wasn\'t in the queue for NATO
membership because Kyiv sought other ways to tie its future to the
West,\" Krepon said. \"But the offer of NATO membership was certainly a
contributing factor.\" And, like Rohlfing, Krepon points to a threat
beyond just nuclear weapons that could see Europe flooded with
conventional weapons capable of instilling mass \"terror\" among the
populace. He asserted that \"the biggest unacknowledged arms control
challenge is for conventionally-armed missiles,\" including ballistic
weapons that are \"also very fast\" as well as \"cheaper and they still
get the job done.\" But he warned that \"[nuclear weapons delivery
vehicles aren\'t going away]{.underline}.\" In fact, he said, \"[**they
will be modernized**, at great expense, and hypersonics will be added as
niche weapons for a subset of targets]{.underline}.\" Another expert
with decades of experience working with nuclear weapons said the U.S.
has also wrestled with the series of events that led us to the present
crisis. \"Whenever something I do doesn\'t work out, the first question
I ask is, could I have done this differently?\" Theodore A. Postol, a
nuclear weapons technology expert and professor emeritus at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Newsweek. \"Sometimes the
answer is no, sometimes the answer is yes.\" But over the course of
several U.S. administrations failing to take into account Russia\'s core
security concerns, he argued, \"there\'s no reflection at all.\" READ

Far-Right Joins the Fight Postol has worked hands-on with data relating
to some of the world\'s deadliest systems in previous capacities with
the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and as an adviser to
the Chief of Naval Operations. He recalled a time shortly after the
Soviet Union\'s disintegration in the 1990s, when U.S. and Russian
experts worked side-by-side in hopes of building a post-Cold War future
for the two nations. He said it wasn\'t long, however, before even
Russian professionals in his field were alienated by the brazen behavior
of a nation that had just recently established itself as the world\'s
sole superpower. As such, Postol said, \"**[there has been a serious,
unabated arms race going on between Russia and the United States that
has been uninterrupted by the collapse of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}**.\" \"What the Russians have certainly learned is
that the United States is proceeding as vigorously as it can with
improving its nuclear war-fighting capabilities,\" he added. \"I think
that\'s clear and unambiguous.\" While [the failure of arms control
treaties]{.underline}, now reduced to one remaining key pact, the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), over the past two decades
is well known, one less-publicized development that proved influential
in Russia\'s own bid for bigger[, more powerful weapons was the U.S.
production of a burst-height compensating super-fuze for
submarine-launched warheads, something that Postol said \"essentially
doubled\" the U.S. nuclear strike capability.]{.underline} The U.S.
improvements help explain Moscow\'s emphasis on developing weapons that
could not be countered, and so does Russia\'s own awareness of what
Postol said are shortcomings in its own early warning systems, a
critical capability that could mean the difference between identifying a
true nuclear attack or a false alarm. While the Cuban Missile Crisis is
perhaps the most potent example of nuclear brinksmanship between the
U.S. and Russia, a number of precarious near-misses have been the result
of miscalculations. Among the more prominent of these close-calls is the
1983 Able Archer exercise during which NATO trained for a full-scale
nuclear attack against the Soviet Union, which, concerned about a
potential coverup for an actual strike, put its nuclear forces on high
alert. But another high-profile incident occurred in the post-Soviet
era. In 1995, a joint U.S.-Norwegian team launched a scientific rocket
from the Andøya Space center and Russian forces, unable to immediately
distinguish the rocket from a Trident submarine-launched ballistic
missile, prepared a potential retaliatory strike before it was
determined that the object in question was veering away from Russian
territory. Postol said that, at the time, the fact that Moscow and
Washington were on relatively good terms played into Russia\'s calculus
in not ordering a quick reaction. Given the current downfall in trust,
however, he worried such an incident could bring the world even closer
to nuclear destruction. \"If it had occurred today, with them invading
Ukraine,\" Postol said, \"I don\'t think it would have resulted in an
accidental Russian nuclear launch. I do not want to overstate that
point, but I think it would have brought the Russian forces onto a
higher state of alert.\" With tensions high, Postol said even the
savviest Russian generals may ask themselves, \"What might the Americans
do?\" \"I think they would be very sober because they know that the
Americans would be stupid beyond belief to attack them with nuclear
weapons,\" Postol added, \"but it would be somewhat dicier because of
all these things that are now going on.\" Last month, about a week
before Putin announced the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine,
threatening outside powers with \"such consequences that you have never
experienced in your history\" should they seek to intervene, Russian
Security Council Deputy Secretary Mikhail Popov spoke of the
difficulties of discerning a threat in the heat of the moment,
especially when tensions ran so high. \"Hardly anyone, except
specialists, comes to realize that modern systems spot launches of
missiles quite quickly but cannot identify whether these missiles carry
nuclear weapons,\" Popov told Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
\"That is why, any missile launch may be perceived as a nuclear strike
amid the tense military and political situation.\" And even if Moscow
and Washington are able to climb out of the rut in their relations,
described by Biden as a \"complete rupture,\" to return to strategic
stability talks, Postol was skeptical that the kind of \"unimaginative\"
approach he anticipated would do much to make the world safer. \"The
United States will not address fundamental problems like the danger from
shortfalls in Russia\'s early warning system, which is an extremely
dangerous source of a potential accidental nuclear war, which could lead
to an accidental nuclear war and the crisis,\" Postol said. \"And the
U.S. continuous effort to increase the war-fighting capability of its
nuclear forces will cause the Russians to be more and more likely to
take actions to defend themselves that could make the chances of an
accidental nuclear war considerably higher.\" US, Minuteman, III, ICBM,

soaring U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine was postponed after Russian
President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on heightened alert over
the crisis. MICHAEL PETERSON/SPACE LAUNCH DELTA 30 PUBLIC AFFAIRS/U.S.
SPACE FORCE The view from Moscow is bleak as well. \"**[We are way past
the phase when academics and think-tankers could legitimately invoke the
\'risk\' of a new arms race]{.underline}**,\" Artem Kvartalnov, a
research fellow at the Moscow-based PIR Center and a member of the
Germany-Russia-U.S. Young Deep Cuts Commission arms control group, told
Newsweek. \"[The arms race has already been there since Putin presented
Russia\'s new strategic weapon systems in 2018 and since the U.S.
increased funding for many of its military programs]{.underline} around
the same time,\" Kvartalnov said. \"What we should fear now is potential
new dimensions of this arms race.\" For the U.S., a country whose
defense budget is larger than the next 11 nations combined, including
both China and Russia, the possibilities are nearly limitless. The
Pentagon has faced a number of setbacks in its own hypersonic missile
program but a meeting held last month by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
and defense industry leaders was aimed toward improving and accelerating
efforts to bring to fruition an array of projects currently in the
works. Kvartalnov predicted further U.S. and allied deployments in
Europe, culminating in a risky remilitarization of the continent. \"As
the invasion of Ukraine will likely result in more NATO rather than less
NATO,\" he said, \"military posturing in Europe can reach long-forgotten
levels.\" Some were less confident in the U.S. capability to keep up
with endless military spending in the long term. \"Well, I suppose if
you think you could just print money in perpetuity without any
consequences, we could have an arms race, but, to be quite frank, I
think we\'re nearing bankruptcy here,\" Douglas Macgregor, a retired
U.S. Army colonel who served under Trump as senior adviser to
then-Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, said in response to
Newsweek\'s question during a panel last week. He argued that, with the
U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio at upwards of 120%, \"we\'re not healthy.\" \"We
cannot afford this major buildup that people talk about,\" Macgregor
said. \"We\'ve wasted trillions on all sorts of bright shiny objects.
There has been no strategic focus to guide any of this spending. I think
we\'ve about had it.\" And while he said the opportunity may be
tantalizing to a number of members of Congress, he also felt \"our
internal affairs are going to constrain us dramatically in the near
future.\" The situation may prove even more arduous for Russia, where an
increasingly restrictive wave of global sanctions in response to
Putin\'s intervention in Ukraine threatens to strangle Moscow\'s own
military modernization program. But a lifeline exists that could prove
further geopolitically challenging for Washington. China has sought to
adopt a balanced position on the conflict in Ukraine, one that has
shifted Washington\'s attention from its leading 21st-century rival,
Beijing, to the old foe of Moscow. But the U.S. strategy of attempting
to take on both powers at once has only driven them to further embrace
one another\'s worldview and form a \"comprehensive strategic
partnership of coordination for the new era,\" a bond that promises a
new kind of bilateral relationship beyond that of Cold War-era blocs and
alliances. The result thus far [has been an unprecedented level of
cooperation between Beijing and Moscow,]{.underline} one that includes
not only trade pacts capable of dodging Western sanctions but also joint
military-technical endeavors that both Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi
Jinping pledged to continue during their summit last month. Beijing has
never been a party to the arms control treaties signed between Moscow
and Washington, and Chinese officials have expressed vehement resistance
to joining such measures, much to U.S. concern. And while China\'s far
smaller arsenal has shown growth both in size and sophistication in
recent years, Beijing, unlike the two leading nuclear powers, maintains
a \"no-first-use\" policy officially precluding that the People\'s
Republic would be the first to introduce a nuclear strike in a
non-nuclear conflict. \"We oppose the use of nuclear weapons, and what
we see is that the nuclear war will never be won by any parties,\" Liu
Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, told
Newsweek during a press briefing Monday. \"We oppose any nuclear wars.\"
But [even Beijing has expressed alarm at the level to which Russia and
the U.S. were responding to their frictions with nuclear-related
steps.]{.underline} \"**[There are nuclear moves,]{.underline}** I
don\'t think this is the proper way to solve the problem,\" Liu said.
\"Now, it\'s to de-escalate the situation.\" And while Beijing has
offered to play a diplomatic role to defuse the crisis in Ukraine
itself, some in the U.S. have called for dramatic military moves,
including potential airstrikes against Russian convoys or imposing a
no-fly zone over Ukraine. Such moves have been dismissed so far by U.S.
officials, but NATO ally Turkey moved to potentially implement an
effective blockade of Russian warships attempting to enter the Black Sea
by activating the Montreux Convention, a power rooted in longstanding
tensions that pushed Ankara to join NATO in the first place. Given the
disintegration of protective measures and the swelling of bad blood
between Russia and the U.S., which collectively hold up to 90% of the
world\'s nuclear weapons, Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the 2017
Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear
Weapons, told Newsweek she [was \"very concerned\" about dark days to
come for arms control]{.underline}. \"The last ten years, [we\'ve seen a
withdrawal of the arms control agreement]{.underline}, an undermining of
international law and multilateralism **[and an increase in nuclear
modernization and spending]{.underline}**,\" Finh said. \"That\'s why
we\'re in such a dangerous situation right now.\" \"We need to urgently
address the situation in Ukraine to protect civilians, and then double
down on diplomacy, international law and arms control and disarmament
treaties to prevent this from happening again,\" she added. With
U.S.-Russia diplomacy at the wayside, however, there are lingering
concerns over whether the world will get a second chance. A major
confrontation between U.S. and Russian forces has been avoided for a
century since Washington and its allies unsuccessfully intervened
against Russian communist forces who ultimately went on to establish the
Soviet Union in 1922. But 100 years later, another outbreak of war in
Europe indicates the dawn of a brave new world where past safeguards may
no longer be enough. \"Fortunately, there is no direct war between
Russia and the United States at this point,\" Kvartalnov told Newsweek.
\"However, [recent developments in Ukraine show that military dynamics
in Europe have become unpredictable. \"]{.underline} \"A war in Europe
that nobody could envision has become reality,\" he added.
\"Regrettably, [we are entering a world where nothing can be ruled
out---including direct war.\"]{.underline}

This stable deterrence paradigm and related explanation of the arms race
became the basis for much U.S. arms control policy.\[13\] Together, they
led to U.S. arms control efforts being about [codifying "strategic
stability" by attempting to control technical parameters of weapon
systems and their (largely) quantitative
restrictions]{.underline}.\[14\] As one commentator observed,
"[Stability became an essential metric for evaluating nuclear
force]{.underline}s, particularly regarding the wisdom of new nuclear
capabilities and deployment options. Equally important, stability became
the new rationale for U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control."\[15\] The
purpose of arms control was to codify the balance of terror and thereby
stop the action-reaction arms race cycle; U.S. arms control policy came
to be geared to that end.\[16\] [The pursuit of "stability" meant that
the United States should avoid weapon programs that might undermine the
Soviet retaliatory deterrent]{.underline} [threat to U.S.]{.underline}
society and thus avoid compelling the Soviet Union to react to U.S.
actions in a new cycle of the arms race. [Such U.S. restraint would lead
to an "inaction-inaction]{.underline}" [cycle]{.underline} that would
end the arms race and possibly initiate a "peace race."\[17\] Arms
control could advance this happy outcome by limiting or prohibiting
destabilizing systems and thereby slow down if not stop the purported
action-reaction dynamic underlying the arms race. The Cold War stability
paradigm became a governing basis for U.S. strategic arms control goals
and policy: The belief that strategic systems defined as destabilizing
or unnecessary per the Cold War stability paradigm were the cause of the
arms race and thus should be limited or prohibited via arms control was
broadly applied to U.S. strategic forces, but particularly to strategic
missile defense and ICBMs carrying multiple warheads (MIRVs). Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger summarized this dynamic as follows: "The
primary U.S. goal in negotiations was to enshrine forever the strategic
doctrine of mutual vulnerability. By putting caps on each side's
strategic nuclear arsenals and foregoing the deployment of all but the
most limited anti-ballistic missile systems, strategic stability was to
be enhanced."\[18\] An Inconvenient Truth [This approach to arms control
follows from the underlying Cold War stability paradigm and its
mirror-imaging presumption]{.underline}. Assuming opponents' decision
making to be based on known and shared parameters is the basis for the
corresponding beliefs that the conditions that constitute stable
deterrence are fully understood and the functioning of deterrence is so
predictable that strategic forces can be categorized as stabilizing or
destabilizing. **[This mirror imaging presumption was highly
questionable during the Cold War]{.underline}**;\[19\] **[it is even
more so now because the contemporary international threat environment is
far more diverse and unpredictable.]{.underline}**\[20\] Some
contemp[orary adversaries may well not share the U.S. definition of
reasonable, value system or decision-making process.]{.underline} In
particular, they may not share U.S. perceptions of nuclear risk or
consider U.S. balance of terror-style threats sufficiently credible to
be deterred by them.\[21\] Indeed, [their goals and decision making may
drive behavior that **recklessly threatens U.S. and allied security** in
ways deemed "unthinkable]{.underline}" per the Cold War stability
paradigm. The [United States now confronts]{.underline} a
multi-dimensional nuclear environment and a diverse set of threats. Most
notably, it must contend with [new adversaries armed with sophisticated
missile and nuclear capabilities**, revanchist powers** willing to
employ coercive **nuclear first-use threats to achieve their revisionist
geopolitical goals**]{.underline},\[22\] and [countries with worldviews
fundamentally different from, and opposed to those of the United States
and its allies]{.underline}. [These states see the United States as the
impediment to their revisionist geopolitical goals]{.underline}. Indeed,
the [presumptions underlying the Cold War stability paradigm are now so
divorced from the realities of the international environment that it can
no longer be considered a prudent guide for U.S. deterrence or arms
control considerations.]{.underline} Thomas Schelling observed in 2013,
"[Now we are in a different world]{.underline}, a world so much more
complex than the world of the East-West Cold War. It took 12 years to
begin to comprehend the 'stability' issue after 1945, but once we got it
we thought we understood it. Now the world is so much changed, so much
more complicated, so multivariate, so unpredictable, involving so many
nations and cultures and languages in nuclear relationships, many of
them asymmetric, that [it is even difficult to know how many meanings
there are for 'strategic stability,']{.underline} or how many different
kinds of such stability there may be among so many different
international relationships, or what 'stable deterrence' is supposed to
deter in a world of proliferated weapons."\[23\] As Schelling suggested,
relatively new post-Cold War conditions require a new understanding of
deterrence stability---an understanding different from that of the Cold
War paradigm that has for decades dominated U.S. arms control policies
and much public commentary---if not all actual U.S. nuclear policy. A
new understanding of deterrence stability must take into account the
great variability and diversity in adversaries' beliefs, perceptions,
and goals. Whereas [the Cold War stability paradigm assumed similarly
reasonable Russian decision-makers]{.underline} with essentially
defensive deterrence goals, at least some [contemporary opponents appear
to see nuclear weapons as tools of coercion, and the United States may
have only modest understanding of the diverse decision-making processes
and value systems in "key parts of the world]{.underline}."\[24\] Given
the great diversity of opponents, and the types of capabilities that may
be necessary to deter them, [the rigid Cold War categorization of forces
derived from bipolar **mirror imaging no longer makes sense, if it ever
did**]{.underline}. [Forces necessary for deterrence may vary greatly
depending on the opponent and context]{.underline}. In particular,
technical characteristics alone cannot be the basis for declaring a
capability to be stabilizing or destabilizing---understanding opponents'
goals and perceptions also is key, particularly the purposes they
envisage for their nuclear arsenals. Are those purposes essentially
defensive, i.e., for the preservation of an existing order and
boundaries? Or, are they essentially offensive, i.e., for the
destruction of an existing order and boundaries? The same types of
nuclear weapons may be put into service for either purpose, and
correspondingly, the same types of weapons may be stabilizing or highly
destabilizing depending on the intended purpose. This reality upends the
apolitical stabilizing vs destabilizing categorization of forces derived
from the Cold War stability paradigm.

Strategic Stability 137 [The fear of possible retaliation following a US
nuclear first strike]{.underline}, therefore, is [**not a good reason**
why the United States should]{.underline} not maintain a nuclear
**[advantage over rivals]{.underline}**. Indeed, the principal fear in
this scenario is that a disarming strike might not work. [The
concern,]{.underline} therefore, [is]{.underline} one of **[insufficient
US superiority, not too much.]{.underline}** In sum, a nuclear balance
of power that provides the United States with a firststrike capability
[may]{.underline} very well [be destabilizing**, but it is instability
in America's favor**]{.underline} and, therefore, not a good reason why
Washington should not pursue the capability. A Nuclear Inferior
Adversary Strikes First The second, and more common, argument as to why
nuclear superiority might be destabilizing is because the state in the
position of nuclear inferiority (in this case, America's adversaries)
may feel ["use 'em or lose 'em" (UELE) pressure]{.underline}s, but this
argument also **[withers under interrogation]{.underline}**.26 According
to strategic stability theorists, a US nuclear advantage increases the
danger of nuclear war because the inferior opponent may fear that its
nuclear arsenal is vulnerable to a first strike. Rather, than wait for
the adversary (in this case the United States) to move first and wipe
out, or seriously blunt, its strategic forces, the argument goes, the
[inferior state may decide to intentionally]{.underline} launch a
nuclear war early in a crisis in order to avoid suffering a disarming
[first strike]{.underline}. This is the logic most often invoked by
strategic stability theorists when they claim that US nuclear advantages
are destabilizing. This is also the precise problem identified and
inspired by Wohlstetter's basing studies. Use 'em or lose 'em enjoys a
certain superficial plausibility, but, upon closer inspection, there are
two fundamental reasons **[the logic simply does not hold
up.]{.underline}** First, it [ignores the fact that the superior state
**retains a healthy ability to retaliate**]{.underline}. So, [even if
the inferior state is worried about having its nuclear weapons
eliminated]{.underline} [in a first strike,]{.underline} the [**decision
to launch its nuclear weapons first as a coping mechanism** would be a
decision to intentionally **launch a nuclear war** against a state
**with at least a secure, second-strike capability**]{.underline}. This
means that [even if the inferior state launches its nuclear weapons
first, it will be virtually guaranteed to suffer **devastating nuclear
retaliation**]{.underline}. Moreover, given that it is in a situation of
extreme inferiority (so extreme that it might even be vulnerable to a
preemptive nuclear strike), this would mean intentionally [launching a
devastating nuclear]{.underline} war that **[will likely turn out much
worse for itself then for its opponent]{.underline}**. [It would simply
be irrational for a state to intentionally launch a nuclear war against
a state with an assured retaliatory capability]{.underline}. Let us
consider a concrete example. The United States maintains nuclear
superiority over China, as we have seen in previous chapters. Strategic
stability 138 The Disadvantages of Nuclear Advantages? th[eorists want
us to believe that if the United States takes additional steps to
further **enhance its superiority**,]{.underline} then [China would face
even greater temptations to launch a nuclear first strike]{.underline}
against the US homeland in the event of a serious crisis. In other
words, [strategic stability theorists hold that China would be so
worried about losing a devastating nuclear war against United States
that it would intentionally choose to start a devastating nuclear war
against the United States]{.underline}. **[The argument does not
make sense]{.underline}**. But academic deterrence theorists and other
critics of American nuclear strategy try to have it both ways. They
attempt to argue that a [second-strike capability]{.underline} is
**[sufficient to deter any nuclear-armed state from launching a nuclear
attack]{.underline}**. Therefore, they advocate that the United States
need not build a nuclear force that goes beyond this requirement because
a second-strike capability is more than enough. But, then they warn that
if Washington strengthens its nuclear forces too much, other countries
will be tempted to launch a nuclear attack against a United States armed
with a second-strike capability. So, which is it? [Does a second-strike
capability reliably deter intentional nuclear attack, or
not?]{.underline} If not, then they cannot maintain that a second-strike
capability is more than enough for deterrence. If so, they cannot claim
that a second-strike capabilityplus will provoke a nuclear attack. Some
readers may retort that my argument also attempts to have it both ways
too, but they would be mistaken. As the attentive reader will recall,
this book has consistently argued that [a second-strike capability is
sufficient to deter an intentional nuclear attack]{.underline} and that
[nuclear superiority contributes to a state's national security
goals]{.underline} in other ways: limiting the damage of nuclear war,
deterring lowerlevel disputes, and enhancing bargaining leverage in
high-stakes crises. In sum, the argument of this book is internally
consistent, but the claims of strategic stability theorists contain a
logical contradiction. Furthermore, [UELE arguments]{.underline} are
unpersuasive for a second reason. These arguments [overlook the fact
that the inferior **state has a more attractive option**]{.underline} at
each stage of the crisis: **[backing down and living to fight another
day]{.underline}**. A state in a position of inferiority involved in a
high-stakes crisis always has a choice between three options: (1)
[intentionally launching a nuclear first strike in a devastating nuclear
war that it will almost **certainly lose;** (]{.underline}2) [playing
brinkmanship, escalating the crisis, and raising the risk of nuclear
war]{.underline} in a contest that it is also likely to lose; or (3) 
**[simply de-escalating the crisis and avoiding any further
danger]{.underline}**. Faced with this menu, option 1 is by far the
least attractive, but this is precisely the option we must believe
leaders will purposely choose in order for the UELE logic to hold. This
is untenable. Indeed, much of nuclear deterrence theory and strategy as
it has developed over the past 70 years is based on the premise that
**[option 1 is simply unacceptable]{.underline}**. Contrary to the
claims of strategic stability theorists, therefore, UELE **[does not
pose a problem to strategic stability]{.underline}**. Strategic
Stability 139 To be sure, if a nuclear war were preordained to occur
with 100% certainty, then an inferior state might have good reason to go
first, but the risk of nuclear war is never certain. Indeed, the risk of
nuclear war is in the control of both states. [To avoid any risk of
nuclear conflict,]{.underline} **[all they must do is
capitulate]{.underline}**. [While]{.underline} an
[unattractive]{.underline} option, it is **[more desirable than
intentionally launching a devastating nuclear war]{.underline}** that it
is bound to lose. Indeed, even the highly stylized game theoretic model
in chapter 1, which relies on a spontaneous risk of nuclear war, assumes
that states can avoid any further risk of catastrophe by submitting at
any stage of the crisis. There are five possible counterarguments to
these claims, but none of them are persuasive. First, one could argue
that the above case against strategic stability theory rests on states
making rational calculations, but the leadership of future US
adversaries might not be fully rational. Kim Jong Un in North Korea, for
example, may be irrational or extremely risk acceptant and may be
willing to run great risks of, or even to intentionally fight, a nuclear
war. This is possible. But, if this is the case, then, we should not
expect strategic stability through mutual vulnerability and nuclear
parity to discourage him from starting a nuclear war either. Surely, the
subtleties of strategic stability theory would be lost on a lunatic.
Moreover, even madmen and excessive risk takers have some understanding
of power. If anything, a future reckless leader should be even more
willing to launch a catastrophic nuclear war from a position of parity
(i.e., a situation of so-called strategic stability), than from a
position of inferiority. Second, one might counter that states will
refrain from UELE in most circumstances, but in truly dire straits, when
their backs are against the wall and they have nothing left to lose,
then we cannot rule out the possibility of inferior states lashing out
with nuclear strikes. For example, they might claim, a state on the
verge of being overrun in a conventional invasion might use nuclear
weapons rather than lose everything.27 Some analysts believe that Russia
or North Korea, for example, may conduct limited nuclear "de-escalation"
strikes rather than lose a conventional war against the United States.28
This is a compelling argument, but note that this is not an argument
about UELE, or about the nuclear balance of power. Rather, this is an
argument about the dangers of putting an opponent's back against the
wall in international politics. This is a cardinal rule of diplomacy,
but it is not a reason to avoid military nuclear advantages. Indeed, if
anything (and as above), a country in a dire position would likely be
even more tempted to gamble for resurrection through nuclear use from a
position of parity, rather than from a position of severe inferiority.
Once again, the idea that US nuclear superiority somehow increases the
risk of nuclear war against the United States does not add up. Third,
and related, my colleagues have argued that it is possible that a US
adversary might pursue a limited nuclear war strategy with a vulnerable
nuclear 140 The Disadvantages of Nuclear Advantages? force. Rather than
lose the opportunity to "escalate to de-escalate," therefore, the state
may conduct a limited nuclear strike early in a crisis to shock the
United States into suing for peace, before the United States succeeds in
wiping out its nuclear forces. This would be a true UELE situation, they
maintain, because the enemy is incentivized to escalate early precisely
in order avoid losing the option. This argument, however, solves one
logical contradiction only to create another. Theories of limited
nuclear war do not maintain that limited nuclear strikes are decisive in
and of themselves. Rather, they have coercive power because they signal
the threat of more devastation to come. It is one of the highest rungs
on brinkmanship's escalation ladder. [If a state is vulnerable to a
first strike]{.underline}, however, then **[it cannot credibly threaten
that there is more devastation to come]{.underline}**. The [United
States would have **little incentive to sue for peace**]{.underline} in
response to a limited strike from such a state. **[It could simply
retaliate]{.underline}** (with the full moral and legal authority that
would follow victimization in a nuclear attack) and [disarm the enemy's
**remaining nuclear force**]{.underline}s. Again, this state would be
better off simply backing down than inviting the disarming nuclear
strike it was trying to ward off. If, on the other hand, the state has a
survivable force, then it would not have needed to escalate early for
fear of UELE in the first place. The only possible exception to this
logic would be for a state with a vulnerable force, following a limited
nuclear war strategy, that believes that Washington's stake in the
crisis is so insignificant, that the United States would prefer to back
down after suffering a limited strike, rather than follow through with a
disarming retaliatory strike of its own. This would be one rational
pathway to nuclear escalation due to UELE, but it is a bit of a stretch.
A number of unusual conditions must be necessary to make this scenario
possible. It is certainly not the broad class of instability problems
often portrayed by strategic stability theorists. Moreover, it is a
problem that can be addressed. In these cases, Washington can simply
take additional steps to demonstrate its stake in these scenarios and to
disabuse adversaries of the notion that Washington would simply buckle
after a limited nuclear attack from a state with a vulnerable nuclear
force. Fourth, one Washington DC-based colleague has argued that the
theory of this book itself provides a reason for superiority to
undermine stability. He argued that a state in an inferior position may
conduct a massive counterforce nuclear strike on the United States in
order to vault itself into the superior position and then use its
newfound superiority to deter US retaliation. This is certainly an
interesting idea. But it would again require us to believe that the
state would intentionally launch a massive nuclear war against a state
with a secondstrike capability. This is a notion that is contrary to
every major theory of nuclear deterrence, including strategic stability
theory itself. In addition, this argument would have to maintain that
this hard-to-fathom scenario would be more likely if the United States
enjoys superiority. But, if anything, an enemy attempt to Strategic
Stability 141 conduct a nuclear first strike and then "deter our
deterrent" should be more attractive to an enemy in a position of parity
than one in an inferior position.29 Fifth, and finally, some might
object that UELE does not cause leaders to intentionally launch nuclear
war, but rather, in a bid to ensure the survivability of their arsenals,
they might be forced to take steps to ensure, should the need arise,
that they can use them before they are wiped out. They might be tempted,
therefore, to adopt launch on warning nuclear postures, put their
nuclear forces on hair-trigger alerts in a crisis, or delegate nuclear
launch authority to low-level commanders. While these steps might be
logical to ensure the survivability of the force, they also might make
it harder for national leadership to control exactly when and how
nuclear weapons are used and, therefore, increase the risk of accidental
or inadvertent nuclear exchange. In other words, this line of argument
essentially holds that inferior states will be more willing to run risks
of nuclear war in serious crises. Note, however, that this logic runs
exactly counter to the expectation of the superiority-brinkmanship
synthesis theory. The central argument of this book maintains that
[inferior states **will be much more cautious in games of
brinkmanship**]{.underline}. Theoretically, the argument of this book
demonstrates that [there is good reason why inferior states should **be
less willing to run nuclear risks**]{.underline}---because [they will
suffer]{.underline} **[disproportionality should things
escalate]{.underline}**. Which perspective is correct? To some degree,
this is a debate that cannot be definitively settled in the empirical
realm. We therefore finish this chapter with a consideration of the
empirical record. Strategic Stability: The Evidence If the UELE argument
from strategic stability theory is correct, then we should expect that
nuclear inferior states will intentionally launch nuclear wars against
states with superior nuclear arsenals. We should also expect that
inferior states will engage in risky behavior in high-stakes crises to
ensure that their nuclear weapons can be launched before they are
destroyed. If, on the other hand, the argument of this book is correct,
then we should expect that nuclear inferior states should never
intentionally launch nuclear wars and they should be hesitant to run
risks of nuclear war against nuclear superior adversaries. [Turning back
to the empirical record reviewed]{.underline} in the first half of the
book, we [see that nuclear inferior states have **frequently backed down
in high-stakes crises**]{.underline} with nuclear superior opponents.
Nuclear inferior states have [placed forces on **alert in
crises**]{.underline} and have otherwise run risks of nuclear war, [but
they have been less, not more, **likely to do so than their superior
opponents**]{.underline}. [Nuclear inferior states have never issued a
compellent threat against a nuclear superior opponen]{.underline}t. 142
The Disadvantages of Nuclear Advantages? And nuclear inferior states
have never intentionally launched a nuclear war against a superior
opponent due to UELE fears or for any other reason. It is certainly
possible that some future leader may intentionally launch nuclear
weapons in order to avoid the risk that they will be destroyed in a
nuclear attack. But [logic and over 70 years of evidence give us strong
reason to be **skeptical that this is a likely outcome.**]{.underline}

military or civilian, devoted to this subject for decades---government

of the terrorist threat.\[3\] While this lack of attention has now come
to an end[, Cold War thought and jargon about deterrence stability
continue to abound in much Western thinking and most public
commentary]{.underline}. Yet, that thought and jargon provide dubious

envisage nuclear first-use threats and possible limited nuclear first

po]{.underline}wers like the United States and Russia / the Soviet Union
have [long claimed]{.underline} that nuclear [proliferation must be
stopped.]{.underline}

From a cynical point of view, it\'s **[easy to see why established
superpowers would say this]{.underline}**. [States that already have
nuclear arms]{.underline} naturally **[want to enjoy the
benefits]{.underline}** of having far more destructive military power
than other states. Put another way: powerful states prefer the
centralization of power over the diffusion of power. If other potential
rivals gain access to nuclear weapons, this could limit what a legacy
nuclear power can do in the international sphere. For example, it\'s
easy to see that that United States has not attempted regime change in
any nuclear power, while nonnuclear states are sitting ducks for US
regime change plans. The same applies to Russia, and it is a virtually
sure bet that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine at all had Ukraine
not given up its nuclear arsenal in 1994.

But, of course, [nuclear states tend to downplay the cynical
reasons]{.underline} and instead state a variety of other reasons as to
why proliferation is a bad thing. They say that nuclear proliferation
will mean terrorists will use nuclear weapons. They s[ay that only
today\'s nuclear powers can be trusted]{.underline} with the security of
nuclear weapons and that all other countries are run by madmen that
would use nuclear weapons at the slightest provocation.

This [narrative been tremendously successful in shaping public
opinion]{.underline}, and it\'s a safe bet that a large portion of the
US voting population opposes nuclear proliferation on these grounds.
American voters have even shown widespread support for fighting numerous
wars---such as wars against Iran and Iraq---to prevent the acquisition
of \"weapons of mass destruction.\"

[But among those who]{.underline} [**actually** study nuclear diplomacy
and **proliferation**]{.underline}, some [scholars]{.underline} have
**[never found the antiproliferation alarmism quite
convincing]{.underline}**. Rather, some have found that
[proliferation]{.underline} **[would actually act to restrain existing
large nuclear-armed states]{.underline}** [from reckless and bloody
wars]{.underline} such as those the US pursued in Iraq and the current
war in Ukraine.

The Proliferationist View

Is was accepted as nearly indisputable in the United States after the
Second World War that no other nation must ever be allowed to possess
nuclear arms. Of course, as time went on, several other states did
obtain these arms. Proliferation began with the Soviet Union in 1949 and
from there expanded to France and the United Kingdom in 1952 and 1960,
respectively. China secured its own arsenal in 1964, and Israel is
believed to have done the same sometime during the 1960s or 1970s.

By then, the US-led antiproliferation movement was in full swing, but
this did not end proliferation. India secured its own arsenal in 1974,,
and Pakistan followed suit in 1998. The most recent state to join the
nuclear club is North Korea, with an arsenal that dates to 2006.

Some states have voluntarily given up their arsenals---i.e., Ukraine,
Kazakhstan, and Belarus---and others---such as South Africa and
Sweden---have halted nearly mature nuclear programs.

But [as proliferation continued]{.underline} **[and major wars did not
result]{.underline}**, some [scholars began to **doubt that
proliferation significantly increases the odds of nuclear
conflict**]{.underline}. In fact, the [opposite may be
true]{.underline}: **[proliferation may limit conflict]{.underline}**.

Perhaps the first influential scholar to seriously question the
antiproliferation position was Kenneth Waltz. In a 1981 paper, \"The
Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May Be Better,\" Waltz suggested that
[proliferation is inevitable]{.underline} **[yet not as
dangerous]{.underline}** as many contend. As summarized by Henry
Sokolski:

In 1981, Kenneth Waltz popularized French and American finite deterrence
thinking of the late-1950s by asking whether or not nuclear weapons in
more hands might be better. His answer was yes. [As nuclear weapons
spread]{.underline}, he argued, **[adversaries would view war as being
self-defeating]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[peace would become
more certain]{.underline}**.1

Or, as George Perkovich put it, Waltz \"has been the most illustrious
proponent\" of the view that \"the [one major benefit of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} conceivably would be to [**create deterrence
relationships** that]{.underline} lower or **[eliminate the risk of
war]{.underline}** between a certain set of adversaries.\"2

Waltz was not alone. In more recent decades, Harvey Sapolsky has
concluded that [nuclear nonproliferation can]{.underline} **[actually
expand the risk of nuclear war]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[expanding US nuclear guarantees for an increasing number of
states]{.underline}**. That is, the US has---in the name of countering
proliferation---pledged to fight nuclear wars to defend nations in every
corner of the globe. This \"[extended deterrence\"]{.underline} has the
[potential to]{.underline} tragically **[turn regional conflicts into
global nuclear ones:]{.underline}**

I fear ... we [have more to fear as a nation from the costs of extended
deterrence]{.underline} than **[from the need to deter additional
nuclear-armed enemies]{.underline}** ...3

Moreover, Sapolsky notes the nonproliferation effort has not actually
stopped proliferation, with India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea all
having become nuclear-armed states since the implementation of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1970. The
fact these new nuclear states have not engaged in nuclear war cannot be
attributed to the existence of a nonproliferation treaty, but to the
realities of nuclear deterrence as described by Waltz---and by Bertrand
Lemennicier in his game theory--based analysis \"Nuclear Weapons:
Proliferation or Monopoly?\"4

The benefits of deterrence also factor into John Mearsheimer\'s writings
in favor of limited proliferation, most notably his argument that
[Ukraine]{.underline} **[would have benefited from maintaining its own
nuclear arsenal]{.underline}** in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Union.5

Sapolsky concludes that, for a variety of reasons, \"[not many nations
will seek to acquire nuclear weapons,\" **even in the absence of a
nonproliferation regime**]{.underline}.6 He goes on to note, rather,
that \"the biggest obstacle to getting beyond the NPT is the fear of
terrorists using a stolen or otherwise ne­fariously obtained nuclear
weapon to blackmail or de­stroy civilization.\"7

John Mueller has written numerous books and articles on this fear.8
Mueller has explained that [states**---even rogue
ones**]{.underline}---[have]{.underline} **[no motivation to transfer
the control of nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [to those outside the
state\'s control]{.underline}. One problem a rogue dictator or oligarch
faces is that \"**[there would be too much risk]{.underline}**---[even
for a country led by extremists]{.underline}---that the [ultimate source
of the weapon would be discovered]{.underline}.\" Muller notes an even
greater danger:

[There is a very considerable danger to the donor that the
bomb]{.underline} (and its source[) would be dis­covered before
delivery]{.underline}, or **[that it would be exploded]{.underline}** in
a manner and on a target the donor would not ap­prove of---including
**[on the donor itself.]{.underline}** Another con­cern would be that the
[terrorist group might be infil­trated by foreign
intelligence.9]{.underline}

And finally, **[there are no known cases of \"loose
nukes]{.underline}**,\" even in the wake of the Soviet Union\'s
collapse:

A careful assessment conducted by the Center for Nonproliferation
Studies has concluded that [it is unlikely that **any of those devices
have been lost** and that, regardless, their effectiveness would be very
low or even nonexistent because they]{.underline} (like all nu­clear
weapons) **[require continual maintenance]{.underline}**. Even some of
those people most alarmed by the prospect of atomic terrorism have
concluded, \"It is probably true that there are no \'loose nukes,\'
transportable nuclear weapons missing from their proper storage
locations and available for purchase in some way.\"10

**No nuke prolif -- too expensive, too difficult, and no one cares**

[HOW ABOUT PROLIFERATION]{.underline} AND TERRORISM?

[Great powers are one thing, some might say, but rogue
states]{.underline} or terrorist groups [are another. If they go
nuclear, it's game over --- which is why any further proliferation must
be prevented by all possible measures, up to and including
war.]{.underline}

[That logic might seem plausible at first, but it **breaks down on close
examination**. Not only has the world already survived the acquisition
of nuclear weapons by some of the]{.underline} \[~~craziest~~\] [mass
murderers in history (Stalin and Mao), but proliferation has **slowed
down** rather than sped up over time. Dozens of technologically
sophisticated countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but
very few have done so. This is because nuclear weapons turn out to be
**difficult and expensive** to acquire and strategically **provocative
to possess**.]{.underline}

[They have not even proved to enhance status much, as many expected they
would.]{.underline} Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today
than they would without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased
if it became nuclear? Did China's status improve when it went nuclear
--- or when its economy grew? And would anybody really care (or even
notice) if the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or
halved?

[Alarmists have misjudged not only the pace of proliferation but also
its effects. Proliferation is incredibly dangerous and necessary to
prevent, we are told, because going nuclear would supposedly empower
rogue states and lead them to dominate their region. The details of how
this domination would happen are rarely discussed,]{.underline} but the
general idea seems to be that once a country has nuclear weapons, it can
use them to threaten others and get its way, with nonnuclear countries
deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out of fear.

[Except, of course, that in three‐​quarters of a century, the United
States has **never been able to get anything close to that obedience**
from anybody, even when it had a nuclear monopoly.]{.underline} So why
should it be true for, say, Iran or North Korea? [It is far more likely
that a nuclear rogue's threats would cause its rivals to **join together
against the provocateur** ---]{.underline} just as countries around the
Persian Gulf responded to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait by closing ranks
to oppose, rather than acquiescing in, his effort at domination.

**Statistical modelling proves no nuke prolif impact**

**Cohen 16** (Michael D. Cohen PhD - convenor of the National Security
College's PhD program and Senior Lecturer at the Crawford School of
Public Policy, "How nuclear proliferation causes conflict: the case for
optimistic pessimism", The Nonproliferation Review, 2016,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10736700.2016.1256541>, MG)

[University of Pennsylvania's Michael Horowitz conducted a statistical
analysis and found that the probability of new nuclear states
reciprocating disputes quickly increases and then **decreases over
time.**]{.underline}

The probability that a nuclear state will reciprocate a dispute with a
non-nuclear state drops from .53 one year after developing nuclear
weapons to .23 in year 56. Two new nuclear powers are 67 percent more
likely to reciprocate a dispute than two average non-nuclear states. Two
experienced nuclear powers are 65 percent less likely to reciprocate
than two average non-nuclear states. The probability of dispute
reciprocation between an experienced and new nuclear power is 26 percent
greater than two non-nuclear states, and the probability of a very
experienced state and a somewhat experienced state reciprocating is 42
percent less than two non-nuclear states.86

[University of California-San Diego's Erik Gartzke conducted a similar
statistical test when the dependent variable was dispute initiation
rather than reciprocation and found similarly robust results.87 Gartzke
found that, while the overall effect of nuclear proliferation on
conflict propensity is neutral, there is variation in the effect of
proliferation over time. Nuclear proliferation influences the **timing,
rather than the occurrence**, of disputes. While new nuclear states are
prone to initiate militarized disputes, over time they moderate their
policies and become as **likely to initiate disputes as they were before
nuclear proliferation**.88]{.underline} These effects wash out in
statistical tests that do not control for experience with nuclear
weapons. In short, if Iran and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and
challenge their regional status quo, the historical record suggests that
they will not do so for long. Thus James M. Lindsay and Ray Takeyh of
the Council on Foreign Relations recently claimed that a nuclear Iran
would be most dangerous "at first, when it would likely be at its most
reckless." B[ut, "like other nuclear aspirants before them, the
guardians of the theocracy might discover that nuclear bombs are
**simply not good** for diplomatic leverage or strategic
aggrandizement." 89]{.underline}

Conclusion: proliferation pessimism, Iran, and North Korea

[Three of the four mechanisms long alleged to make nuclear proliferation
cause interstate conflict find **little to no empirical support** when
the endogeneity, omitted-variable bias, and conceptual-confusion issues
addressed above are recognized and applied to the evidence.
Preventive-war motivations, nonsurvivable arsenals, and organizational
logics that lead to accidents do not cause armed conflict. The only
mechanism that has systematically led to conflict is conventional
aggression by weak revisionists after nuclear proliferation, but a few
years of experience with nuclear weapons moderates the conflict
propensity of new nuclear states. By failing to specify how frequently
we should observe preventive motivations, their effect on nonsurvivable
arsenals, or how organizational logics lead to conflict, accidents, and
nuclear war, **proliferation pessimist claims are
unfalsifiable**.]{.underline} Pessimist scholars need to specify how
much longer we should observe them not leading to conflict before
concluding that their threat has been greatly exaggerated.

[The undesirability of nuclear use has prevented scholars from coming to
terms with what a more careful and systematic reading of the historical
record suggests about the relationship between these mechanisms and
conflict. Sagan]{.underline} has argued that proliferation fatalism and
deterrence optimism reduce incentives to combat proliferation.90 [But
these same dynamics have led scholars to **vastly exaggerate** the
number of threats posed by the spread of nuclear weapons. If the
greatest danger posed by nuclear proliferation is conventional
aggression in the short-term, scholars need to rediscover how
**deterrence** can moderate the high conflict propensity of new nuclear
states.91]{.underline} Arguments about the frequency of nuclear
escalation, however, say nothing about its cost. Isn't the possibility
of nuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula, for example, evidence
against the arguments made throughout this paper? A few cases of
accidental, unintentional, or deliberate nuclear escalation could show
that the mechanisms offered by pessimist scholars linking nuclear
proliferation and conflict survive the criticisms leveled at them here.
A lower bar for the proliferation-pessimist theory to pass might be one
case of nuclear escalation. [But after seventy years, nuclear weapons
have **not once** led to conflict through the mechanisms addressed
here.]{.underline}

**Studies prove nuclear prolif has either no effect on the risk of
interstate conflict or reverses it**

**Suzuki 15** (Akisato Suzuki - Adjunct Research Fellow at the School of
Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, "Is
more better or worse? New empirics on nuclear proliferation and
interstate conflict by Random Forests", Research and Politics, 2015,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015589625>, MG)

[The main findings reveal that the optimist expectation of the
relationship between nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict is
empirically supported:9 first, a larger number of nuclear states on
average **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate conflict;
and second, there is **no clear evidence** that the emergence of new
nuclear states increases the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict]{.underline}. Gartzke and Jo (2009) argue that [nuclear weapons
themselves have no exogenous effect on the probability of conflict,
because when a state is engaged in or expects to engage in conflict, it
may develop nuclear weapons to keep fighting, or to prepare for, that
conflict.]{.underline} If this selection effect existed, the analysis
should overestimate the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear
proliferation in the above model. Still, the [results indicate that a
larger number of nuclear states are associated with fewer disputes in
the system.]{.underline}

This conclusion, however, raises questions about how to reconcile this
study's findings with those of a recent quantitative dyadic-level study
(Bell and Miller, 2015). [The current paper finds that nuclear
proliferation **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict, while Bell and Miller (2015) find that nuclear symmetry has no
significant effect on dyadic conflict, but that nuclear asymmetry is
associated with a higher probability of dyadic conflict. It is possible
that nuclear proliferation **decreases conflict** through the
conflict-mitigating effects of extended nuclear deterrence and/or fear
of nuclear states' intervention, to the extent that these effects
**overwhelm** the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear--asymmetrical
dyads]{.underline}. Thus, dyadic-level empirics cannot solely be relied
on to infer causal links between nuclear proliferation and a systemic
propensity for conflict. The systemic-level empirics deserve attention.
