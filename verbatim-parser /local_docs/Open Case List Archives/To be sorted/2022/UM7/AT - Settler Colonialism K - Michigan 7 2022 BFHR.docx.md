#### Afro-Pessimism fails to understand failure. Transformative revolutions can make new worlds through relational humanisms.

**Gordon 17** (Lewis R, Professor of Philosophy @ UConn, "Thoughts on
Afropessimism", Contemporary Political Theory, Volume 17, Issue, 1,
pages 105-137, December 7)

[I begin with]{.underline} this tale of philosophical abstraction to
contextualize [Afropessimism. Its main exemplars, such as Jared Sexton
and Frank Wilderson III]{.underline}, emerged from academic literary
theory, an area dominated by poststructuralism even in many cases that
avow ''Marxism.'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) [divert from a
reductive poststructuralism]{.underline}, however, through examining
important existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012)
observed, by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. The critical question
that Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation. (I'm using the capital ''B'' here to
point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but also to the
nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both, since blacks
and Blacks have a central and centered role in their thought.) The world
that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks is, for Afropessimists, a
crushing, historical one whose Manichaean divide is sustained contraries
best kept segregated. Worse, any effort of mediation leads to confirmed
black subordination. Overcoming this requires purging the world of
antiblackness. Where cleansing the world is unachievable, an alternative
is to disarm the force of antiblack racism. Where whites lack power over
blacks, they lose relevance -- at least politically and at levels of
cultural and racial capital or hegemony. [Wilderson]{.underline} (2008),
for instance, [explores my concept of ''an antiblack world'' to build
similar arguments. Sexton]{.underline} (2011[) makes similar moves in
his discussions of ''social death.'']{.underline} As this forum doesn't
afford space for a long critique, I'll offer several, non-exhaustive
criticisms.

The first is that [[''an antiblack world'' is not]{.mark} identical with
[''the world is antiblack.'']{.mark}]{.underline} My argument is that
[such a world is an antiblack racist project. [It is not the historical
achievement. Its limitations emerge from a basic fact: Black
people]{.mark} and other opponents of such a project [fought, and
continue to fight]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we see today [in the
#BlackLivesMatter movement and many others, against it.]{.underline} The
same argument applies to the argument about social death. Such an
achievement would have rendered even these reflections stillborn. [[The
basic premises of]{.mark} the [Afropess]{.mark}imistic argument
[are]{.mark}, then, [locked in performative contradictions]{.mark}. Yet,
they have rhetorical force.]{.underline} This is evident through the
continued growth of its proponents and forums (such as this one) devoted
to it.

In Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of
antiblack racism offered under the guise of love, though I was writing
about whites who exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white
sources of black value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies
to oneself in an attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing
falsehoods, exoticists romanticize blacks while affirming white
normativity, and thus themselves, as principals of reality. These
ironic, performative contradictions are features of all forms of racism,
where one group is elevated to godlike status and another is pushed
below that of human despite both claiming to be human.

Antiblack racism offers whites self-other relations (necessary for
ethics) with each other but not so for groups forced in a ''zone of
nonbeing'' below them. There is asymmetry where whites stand as others
who look downward to those who are not their others or their analogues.
[Antiblack racism is thus not a problem of blacks being ''others.'' It's
a problem of their not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-even
being-others. Fanon]{.underline}, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952),
[reminds us that Blacks among each other live in a world of selves and
others.]{.underline} It is in attempted relations with whites that these
problems occur. Reason in such contexts has a bad habit of walking out
when Blacks enter. What are Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced,
because that would be ''violence,'' they must ironically reason
reasonably with forms of unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom.
[Racism is]{.underline}, given these arguments[, a project of imposing
non-relations as the model of dealing with people designated
''black.'']{.underline}

In Les Damne´ de la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), Fanon goes further
and argues that colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean
structure of contraries instead of a dialectical one of ongoing, human
negotiation of contradictions. The former segregates the groups; the
latter emerges from interaction. The police, he observes, are the
mediator in such a situation, as their role is force/violence instead of
the human, discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon, 1991). Such
societies draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or invisibility.
Black appearance, in other words, would be a violation of those systems.
Think of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial killings of
Blacks in those countries.

An immediate observation of many postcolonies is that antiblack
attitudes, practices, and institutions aren't exclusively white. Black
antiblack dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness entails
Black exoticism. Where this exists, Blacks simultaneously receive Black
love alongside Black rejection of agency. Many problems follow. The
absence of agency bars maturation, which would reinforce the racial
logic of Blacks as in effect wards of whites. Without agency, ethics,
liberation, maturation, politics, and responsibility could not be
possible.

[Afropessimism faces the problem of a hidden premise of white agency
versus Black incapacity.]{.underline} Proponents of Afropessimism would
no doubt respond that the theory itself is a form of agency reminiscent
of Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Ne\`gre it was
les Ne\`gres who created Ne´gritude. Whites clearly did not create
Afropessimism, which Black liberationists should celebrate. [[We should
avoid the fallacy]{.mark}, however, [of confusing source with
outcome]{.mark}. History is not short of bad ideas from good
people.]{.underline} If intrinsically good, however, each person of
African descent would become ethically and epistemologically a switching
of the Manichean contraries, which means only changing players instead
of the game.

We come, then, to the crux of the matter. [[If the goal of Afropessimism
is Afropessimism, its achievement would be]{.mark} attitudinal
and]{.underline}, in the language of old, stoic -- in short, [[a symptom
of antiblack society]{.underline}]{.mark}. At this point, there are
several observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the
implications of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the
epistemological implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a
disposition counts as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for
its avowed aims. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these.

An ironic dimension of pessimism is that it is the other side of
optimism. Oddly enough, both are connected to
[[nihilism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, a
decline of values during periods of social decay. [It [emerges when
people no longer want to be responsible]{.mark} for their actions.
Optimists expect intervention from beyond. [Pessimists declare relief is
not forthcoming.]{.mark}]{.underline} Neither takes responsibility for
what is valued. The valuing, however, is what leads to the second,
epistemic point. [[The presumption that what is at stake is what can be
known to determine what can be done is the problem.]{.underline}]{.mark}
If such knowledge were possible, the debate would be about who is
reading the evidence correctly. [[Such judgment would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a priori -- that is, [[prior to events actually
unfolding. The future]{.mark}, unlike transcendental conditions such as
language, signs, and reality, is, however, ex post facto: It [is yet to
come]{.mark}.]{.underline} Facing the future, [[the question
is]{.mark}n't what will be or how do we know what will be but instead
[the realization that whatever is done will be that on which the future
will depend. Rejecting optimism and pessimism]{.mark}, there is a
supervening alternative: [political commitment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The appeal to political commitment]{.underline} is not only in stream
with what French existentialists call l'intellectuel engage´ (committed
intellectual) but also [reaches back through the history and existential
situation of enslaved, racialized ancestors. Many were]{.underline}, in
truth[, an existential paradox: [commitment to action without
guarantees.]{.mark} The slave revolts, micro and macro acts of
resistance, escapes, and returns help others do the same; the cultivated
instability of plantations and other forms of enslavement, and countless
other actions, were waged against a gauntlet of forces designed to
eliminate any hope of success. [The claim of]{.mark} colonialists and
[enslavers was that the future]{.mark} [belonged to them]{.mark}, not to
the enslaved and the indigenous.]{.underline} A result of more than 500
years of conquest and 300 years of enslavement was also a (white)
rewriting of history in which African and First Nations' agency was, at
least at the level of scholarship, nearly erased. [[Yet]{.mark} [there
was resistance]{.mark} even in that realm, [as Africana and First
Nation]{.mark} intellectual history and [scholarship attest.]{.mark}
Such actions set the course for different kinds of struggle
today.]{.underline}

Such reflections occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
[Afropessimism]{.underline}, the existential critique suggests, [suffers
from a failure to understand failure.]{.underline}
[[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark} [Fanon's notion of [constructive
failure, where what doesn't]{.mark} initially [work]{.mark} [transforms
conditions for something new to emerge]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
understand this argument, [[one must rethink the philosophical
anthropology]{.underline}]{.mark} at the heart of a specific line [of
Euromodern thought [on what it means to be human. Atomistic and
individual substance]{.mark}]{.underline}- based, this model,
articulated by Hobbes, Locke, and many others, [[is of a non-relational
being that]{.mark} thinks, [acts]{.mark}, and moves along a course [in
which continued movement depends on not colliding with
others.]{.mark}]{.underline} Under that model, [the human]{.underline}
being is a thing that [enters a system that facilitates]{.underline} or
obstructs [its movement. [An alternative model]{.mark}]{.underline},
shared by many groups across southern Africa, [[is a relational version
of the human]{.underline}]{.mark} being as part of a larger system of
meaning. Actions, from that perspective, are [[not about]{.mark} whether
[''I'']{.mark} succeed [but]{.mark} instead about [''our'']{.mark}
story]{.underline} across time. As relational, it means that each human
being is [[a constant negotiation of ongoing efforts to build
relationships]{.mark} with others]{.underline}, which means no one
actually enters a situation without establishing new situations of
action and meaning. Instead of entering a game, their participation
requires a different kind of project -- especially where the ''game''
was premised on their exclusion. Thus, where the system or game repels
initial participation, such repulsion is [[a shift in the grammar of how
the system functions]{.mark}, especially its dependence on obsequious
subjects. Shifted energy [affords emergence of alternatives.]{.mark}
Kinds cannot be known before the actions that birthed them.]{.underline}

Abstract as this sounds[, it has much historical support.]{.underline}
Evelyn Simien (2016), in her insightful political study Historic Firsts,
examines the new set of relations established by Shirley Chisholm's and
Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. There could be no Barack Obama
without such important predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation. Simien intentionally focused on the most mainstream
example of political life to illustrate this point. [Although no
exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's]{.underline} (and many others') so-called
[''failure.'']{.underline} Beyond presidential electoral politics, there
are numerous examples of how prior, radical so-called ''failures''
transformed relationships that facilitated other kinds of outcome. The
trail goes back to [[the Haitian Revolution and back to every act of
resistance from]{.mark} Nat [Turner's Rebellion]{.mark} in the USA,
[Sharpe's in Jamaica, or Tula's in Curac¸ao and so many other efforts
for social transformation to come.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In existential terms, then, many ancestors of the African diaspora
embodied what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls an existential paradox. All
the evidence around them suggested failure and the futility of hope.
They first had to make a movement of infinite resignation -- that is,
resigning themselves to their situation. Yet they must simultaneously
act against that situation. Kierkegaard called this seemingly
contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates more to a
relationship with a transcendent, absolute being, which could only be
established by a ''leap,'' as there are no mediations or bridge.
Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to transcendent intervention, it
would collapse into faith. If, however, the argument rejects
transcendent intervention and focuses on committed political action, of
taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then the
movement from infinite resignation becomes existential political action.

At this point, the crucial meditation would be on politics and political
action. [An attitude of infinite resignation to the world without the
leap of committed action would simply be pessimistic or
nihilistic.]{.underline} Similarly, an attitude of hope or optimism
about the future would lack infinite resignation. We see here the
underlying failure of the two approaches. Yet ironically, [there is a
form of failure at failing in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic
one, since [if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal,
then]{.mark} the ''act'' of [resignation would have been achieved,
which, paradoxically]{.mark}, would be a success; it [would be a
successful failing of failure]{.mark}.]{.underline} For politics to
emerge, however, there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation.

The first is that politics is a social phenomenon, which means it
requires the expanding options of a social world. Turning away from the
social world, though a statement about politics, is not, however, in and
of itself political. The ancients from whom much western political
theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a disparaging term for
individuals who resigned themselves from political life: idio¯te¯s, a
private person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word -- an
idiot. I mention western political theory because that is the hegemonic
intellectual context of Afropessimism. We don't, however, have to end
our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our linguistic
archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the Middle
Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing entailed
isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. The contemporary inward
resignation of seeking a form of purity from the loathsome historical
reality of racial oppression, in this reading, collapses ultimately into
a form of moralism (private, normative satisfaction) instead of public
responsibility born of and borne by action.

The second is the importance of power. Politics makes no sense without
it. But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin word
potis as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as in an
omnipotent god. If we again look back further, we will notice the Middle
Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which refers to
godlike strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans, even the
gods' abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka
activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a word,
''magic''), which makes reality. All this amounts to a straightforward
thesis on power as the ability with the means to make things happen.

There is an alchemical quality to power. [The human world, premised on
symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning into being, and
those new meanings afford relationships that build
institutions]{.underline} through a world of culture, a phenomenon that
Freud (1989) rightly described as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike
because it addresses what humanity historically sought from the gods:
protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of
misery. Such power clearly can be abused. It is where those enabling
capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the hording of
social resources into propping up some people as gods that the
legitimating practices of cultural cum political institution decline and
stimulate pessimism and nihilism. [That institutions in the Americas
very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to Blacks is the
subtext of Afropessimism]{.underline} and this entire meditation.

The discussion points, however, to a demand for political commitment.
Politics itself emerges under different names throughout the history of
our species, but the one occasioning the word ''politics'' is from the
Greek polis, which refers to ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies
specific kinds of activities conducted inside the city-state, where
order necessitated the resolution of conflicts through rules of
discourse the violation of which could lead to (civil) war, a breaking
down of relations appropriate for ''outsiders.'' Returning to the
Fanonian observation of selves and others, it is clear that imposed
limitations on certain groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option
of politics. Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity, the problem
short of war becomes a political one.

Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: If
the problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political, where
antiblack institutions of power have, as their project, the impeding of
Black power, which in effect requires barring Black access to political
institutions, then antiblack societies are ultimately threats also to
politics defined as the human negotiation of the expansion of human
capabilities or more to the point: freedom.

Anti-politics is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack
racism is hegemonic are also those in which racial moralizing dominates:
moralizing stops at individuals at the expense of addressing
institutions the transformation of which would make immoral individuals
irrelevant. As a political problem, it demands a political solution. It
is not accidental that Blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of
unrealized freedom. As so many from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela Davis
(2003) and Michelle Alexander (2010) have shown, [[the expansion of
privatization and incarceration is squarely placed in a structure of
states and civil societies premised on the limitations of
freedom]{.mark} (Blacks)]{.underline} -- ironically, as seen in
countries such as South Africa and the United States, [in the name of
freedom.]{.underline}

That power is a facilitating or enabling phenomenon, a functional
element of the human world, a viable response must be the establishing
of relations that reach beyond the singularity of the body. I bring this
up because proponents of [[Afropessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} might
object to this analysis because of its appeal to a human world. If that
world is abrogated, the site of struggle becomes that which is patently
not human. It is not accidental that popular race discourse refers today
to ''black bodies,'' for instance, instead of ''black people.'' [As the
human world is discursive, social, and relational, this [abandonment
amounts to an appeal to the non-relational, the incommunicability of
singularity, and appeals to the body and its reach.]{.mark}]{.underline}
At that point, it's perhaps the psychologist, psychiatrist, or
psychoanalyst who would be helpful, as turning radically inward offers
the promise of despair, narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as
Fanon also observed, madness. Even if that slippery slope were rejected,
the performative contradiction of attempting to communicate such
singularity or absence thereof requires, at least for consistency, the
appropriate course of action: silence.

#### Socialization better explains their libidinal thesis

**Hudis 15** \[Peter, Professor of English and History @ Queens College,
2015, "Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades," p. 35-37\]

Fanon's vantage point upon the world is his situated experience. He is
trying to understand the inner psychic life of racism, not provide an
account of the structure of human existence as a whole. [[Racism is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[an **integral part** of the human
psyche; it is a **Social construct**]{.mark} that has a **psychic
impact**. Any effort [to comprehend]{.mark} social distress that
accompanies [racism by reference to some a priori structure]{.mark}- be
it the Oedipal Complex or the Collective Unconscious- **is [doomed to
failure.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Carl Jung sought to deepen and go beyond
Freud\'s approach by arguing that the subconscious is grounded in a
universal layer of the psyche- which he called [[\"the collective
unconscious:]{.mark}\' This [refers to inherited patterns]{.mark} of
thought that exist in all human minds, regardless of specific culture or
upbringing]{.underline}, and which manifest themselves in dreams, fairy
tales, and myths. Jung referred to these universal patterns as
\"archetypes:\' It may seem, on a superficial reading, that 1 Fanon is
drawing from Jung, since he discusses how white people tend to
unconsciously assimilate views of blacks that are based on negative
stereotypes. Even the most \"progressive\" white tends to think of
blacks a certain way (such as \"emotional;\' \"physical,\" or /
\"aggressive\"), even as they disavow any racist animus on their part.
However, [[Fanon denies]{.mark} that such collective delusions are part
of a psychic structure]{.underline}; they [are]{.underline} not
[**[permanent features of the mind]{.mark}**. They are **habits**
acquired from a series of social and cultural impositions. While they
constitute a kind a collective unconscious on the part of many white
people, [they are not]{.mark} grounded in any **[universal]{.mark}**
\"archetype.\"]{.underline} The unconscious prejudices of whites do not
derive from genes or nature, nor do they derive from some form
independent of culture or upbringing. Fanon contends
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} Jung **[[\"confuses habit with
instinct.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanon objects to Jung\'s \"collective
unconscious\" for the same reason that he rejects the notion of a black
ontology. His phenomenological approach brackets out ontological claims
on both a social and psychological level insofar as the examination of
race and racism is concerned. He writes, \"Neither Freud nor Adler nor
even the cosmic Jung took the black man into consideration in the course
of his research." This does not mean that Fanon rejects their
contributions tout court. He does not deny the existence of the
unconscious. He only denies that the inferiority complex of blacks
operates on an unconscious level. [He does not reject the Oedipal
Complex. He only denies that it explains (especially in the West Indies)
the proclivity of the black \"slave\" to mimic the values of the white
\"master.\"]{.underline} And as seen from his positive remarks on
Lacan\'s theory of the mirror stage, he does not reject the idea of
psychic structure. He only denies that it can substitute for an
historical understanding of the origin of neuroses .23 Fanon adopts a
socio-genetic approach to a study of the psyche because that is what is
adequate for the object of his analysis. For Fanon, [it is the
relationship between the socio-economic and psychological that is of
critical import. He makes it clear, insofar as the subject matter of his
study is concerned, that the socio-economic is first of all
**responsible for affective disorders**]{.underline}: \"First, economic.
Then, internalization or rather epidermalization of this
inferiority.\"24 Fanon never misses an opportunity to remind us that
racism owes its origin to specific economic relations of domination-
such as slavery, colonialism, and the effort to coopt sections of the
working class into serving the needs of capital. It is hard to mistake
the Marxist influence here. It does not follow, however, that what comes
first in the order of time has conceptual or strategic priority. The
inferiority complex is originally born from economic subjugation, but it
takes on a life of its own and expresses itself in terms that surpass
the economic. Both sides of the problem-the socio-economic and
psychological-must be combatted in tandem: \"The black man must wage the
struggle on two levels; whereas historically these levels are mutually
dependent, [any unilateral liberation is flawed]{.underline}, and the
worst mistake would be to believe their mutual dependence
automatic:\'\'5 On these grounds he argues that the problem of [racism
cannot be solved on a psychological level. It is not]{.underline} an
**[\"individual\"]{.underline}** problem; [it is]{.underline} a
**[social]{.underline}** one. But neither can it be solved on a social
level that ores the psychological. It is small wonder that although his
name never appears in the book, Fanon was enamored of the work of
Wilhelm Reich. This important Freudian-Marxist would no doubt feel
affinity with Fanon\'s comment, \"Genuine [[disalienation
will]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}en [[achieved
only when things, in the]{.underline}]{.mark} most [[materialist
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, have **[[resumed their rightful
place]{.underline}]{.mark}**:\'27

#### Their account of hope [overgeneralizes]{.underline} -- they are right about the problem with absolute faith in the government, but that's not our argument -- a [pragmatic]{.underline} understanding of hope as [inseparable from political life]{.underline} is [necessary]{.underline} to mobilize activism and prefigurative politics

[What ought I hope for? This question guides]{.underline} our [pursuit
of the good life]{.underline} and its answer is often shaped by our
social, political, and educational experiences. [We aren't born
with]{.underline} ready-made [hopes]{.underline}; rather, [we shape them
through]{.underline} our [interactions]{.underline} with others, our
growing sense of what is possible as [we learn]{.underline} about our
environment, and [our experiments with the world to see what we can do
within it and to change it]{.underline}. Other [people play an important
role]{.underline} in this process, [especially through institutions like
schools]{.underline}, social arrangements like families, and political
practices like democracy. [They shape the traditions and
expectations]{.underline} we inherit, as well as the ways in which we
test, challenge, and revise what has been passed on to us. Despite this,
[[hope is]{.mark} too often [described in individualist terms that
**fail to encapsulate** the full]{.mark} **process** of hoping and its
[potential impact]{.mark} on shared living]{.underline}. [Many
**theologians** link hope with]{.underline} an individual's [faith in a
deity]{.underline} who will act on his or her behalf, 1 [some
philosophers employ a **narrow understanding** of hope as an
individual's desire for an outcome in the face of
uncertainty]{.underline}, 2 while many more psychologists describe hope
as an individual's use of willpower and "waypower" to achieve clear
goals. 3 [Instead, [I]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[offer a **pragmatist
account** of hope]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is [firmly [rooted
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
individuals [[and grows out of real life circumstances, yet cannot be
disconnected from social and political life]{.underline}]{.mark}. 4 I
extend my account to show how [a pragmatist view of hope is necessarily
connected [to]{.mark} other people and can]{.underline} be used to
[enrich our experiences in communities]{.underline}. Moreover, [such
[hope can help us to **better face**]{.mark} **current [political
struggles and social problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all the while
building a democratic identity together. 5 In this article, I will
explain how [[pragmatism offers an enhanced understanding of
hope]{.underline}]{.mark} and its role in our lives together. To examine
the ways in which shared hoping and the shared content of our hopes
shape our identity and our work together in democracy, I consider both
how and what we hope. [[Unlike]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[accounts of
hope that are **largely divorced from life's circumstances**, such as
**theological accounts**]{.mark} that [direct our attention to
deities]{.mark}]{.underline} and psychological accounts [that [tell us
we must hope for our goals regardless of real world
constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[pragmatist hope is]{.mark}
noteworthy because it is firmly rooted in reality]{.underline}. 6
Moreover, [a pragmatist account addresses]{.underline} some of the
[current obstacles]{.underline} we face [in American democracy and is
**[capable of transforming or improving]{.mark}** them]{.underline}.
Perhaps more importantly, [such hope can be directly and indirectly
cultivated within citizens]{.underline}, thereby [offering a feasible
way that democratic life can be strengthened]{.underline}. 1 Present
Context Before looking at hope in detail, let's briefly first take stock
of current conditions that relate to hopelessness in personal and
political life. In pragmatist spirit, the account I offer here must
attend to real conditions. Unfortunately, these are conditions where
hope is struggling, where democracy may be in jeopardy, and where the
dominant form of hope that we do see is largely privatized. To begin, a
recent study using the World Values Survey and other polling sources
finds that democratic [[citizens have]{.underline} "[become more cynical
about]{.underline}]{.mark} [the value of democracy]{.underline} as a
political system, [less hopeful that anything they do might influence
public [policy, and]{.mark} more [willing to]{.mark} express
**[support]{.mark} for [authoritarian
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 7 [Those citizens have
increasingly [**withdrawn** from democratic participation]{.mark},
whether that be through formal institutions or alternatives in the
public or civic spheres]{.underline}, such as joining in movements or
protests. There has been a dramatic shift in how the wealthy view
democracy, with 16 percent of them now believing that military rule is a
better way of living and an astounding 35 percent of rich young
Americans holding such a view. 8 There are likely many factors impacting
this current state of affairs and I will touch on a few here. 9 First,
in terms of hope most overtly, Alan Mittleman rightly notes that "[the
legitimacy of politics is damaged in proportion to its failure to fulfil
the hopes it has engendered]{.underline}." 10 Indeed, several recent
American candidates ran on messages of hope and yet the visions evoked
have often failed to be fulfilled in reality, crushing the heightened
expectations of citizens. [Politicians often use the rhetoric of hope,
but they tend to distort what hope really is and what it requires of
citizens]{.underline}, as I will explain later. Instead, they make
reference to the supposed destiny of the nation with God as its backer.
Or, as in the cases of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, some citizens
place their hope in the leader himself, invoking a messianic figure.
These forms of hope entail no more citizen action than, perhaps,
donating to a campaign or wearing an iconic t-shirt proclaiming "hope."
Instead, I will argue that, rather than passively relying on the hope
promised by politicians, citizens must participate in shaping and
fulfilling hope, making such hope more genuine and robust. Second,
[structural violence and inequality, common amongst poor and racial

of [hope that is more **sustainable** and more **attuned** to the real
conditions of life]{.mark} that we can control and others where we have
limited control]{.underline}. Third, [citizenship]{.underline} in
America [has increasingly become centered on individuals]{.underline},
personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, and private success.
[Historical accounts of rugged individualism]{.underline} have now
[joined forces with calls to educate children in grit and
expectations]{.underline} that one will fight [to earn one's
position]{.underline} and goods [in a competitive
marketplace]{.underline}. 14 [This environment lacks trust in others and
discourages collaborative effort]{.underline}. [Often those who have not
been successful]{.underline} in the past, or do not see viable avenues
for being so in the future, [**fatalistically accept** these conditions
and become passive about countering or changing them]{.underline}.
[While others who have enough resources and power]{.underline} to be
comfortable with the present conditions, [indulge in the privilege of
being cynical or apathetic]{.underline}. [[Some spread]{.mark} these
states of [hopelessness]{.mark}]{.underline} or jaded negativity
[through memes]{.underline} and messages on social media, [especially
about the role and effectiveness of government, **rendering
[cynicism]{.mark} a collective practice**]{.underline}. 15 [Cynics, left
believing that their political efforts are useless or ineffective and
perhaps that everyone acts on self-interest, are left to look out merely
for themselves, without a sense of responsibility to act on behalf of
themselves and others]{.underline}. Indeed, [cynics may mock others who
do not hold such views as naïve and out of touch with
reality]{.underline}. [Cynicism [functions as a **distancing
maneuver**,]{.mark} separating [citizen]{.mark}s from each other, from
formal democratic institutions, and from civic [organizations,]{.mark}
where visions of an improved world and action to achieve it tend to
occur]{.underline}. [My notion of hope aims to span those
divides]{.underline}. Finally, [what is left of hope has become
**privatized**]{.underline}. 16 [This is exacerbated as
neoliberalism]{.underline} continues to assert Margaret [Thatcher's
claims, "There is no such thing as society, only individuals and
families," and "there is no alternative to the market."]{.underline}
[Hope is reduced to a mere drive to achieve one's own limited
dreams]{.underline}, or those of one's children, typically only through
financial terms and material goods. When citizens are rendered isolated
competitors, [they [lose]{.mark} the [**ability to detect social
problems** and]{.mark} the **[motivation to ameliorate them]{.mark}**,
especially if the effects on one's self]{.underline} or family [are not
immediate]{.underline}. Economist Tyler Cowen describes these citizens
as [the new "complacent class,"]{.underline} who are
[content]{.underline} with the way things are as long as they are not
directly harmed and as long [as they can stay surrounded by people and
things that confirm their experience of the world]{.underline}. In their
complacency, the members of the complacent class are unable to "inspire
an electorate with any kind of strong positive visions, other than some
marginal adjustments." 17 I aim to show how hope is better understand as
a social and political endeavor that brings us into contact with others
as we craft visions of the future. In sum, [these changes in citizens'
lives and views **debilitate individual citizens and democracy as a
whole**]{.underline}. [They keep us from recognizing and solving
collective problems and from leading better lives together]{.underline}.
Citizens sit around waiting for reasons to hope, sometimes becoming
swept up in campaign rhetoric when election cycles come around, rather
than acknowledging that [hope is generated through action as subjects
working together]{.underline}, as I will argue. I will turn now to
depict a [pragmatist]{.underline} account of [hope]{.underline} that
[can be]{.underline} formally [cultivated in schools and]{.underline}
informally in [our lives together]{.underline}---a way of hoping
together [that may better support democratic life in these challenging
times]{.underline}. 2 Pragmatist Hope I offer here a pragmatist account
of hope, largely based in the philosophy of John Dewey. Notably, Dewey
himself does not provide such an account, even though hope underlies
much of his work and was evident in his own personal life as he
encountered considerable despair at the loss of two of his children and
his wife, while also facing two world wars. I construct a view of hope
from Dewey's well-articulated elements of inquiry, growth, truth,
meliorism, and habits. [[Pragmatism begins with the real and complicated
conditions of our world]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It brings together
intelligent reflection with inquiry, habits, and action]{.mark} so that
we can understand and change our environments to better align with our
needs and desires]{.underline}. [[Hope plays an important role]{.mark}
in that process]{.underline}. Inquiry, Growth, and Truth For Dewey,
[hope]{.underline} often [arises within the midst of despair, when we
have lost our way and are struggling to move forward]{.underline}.
[Dewey describes these moments as "indeterminate
situations."]{.underline} He turns to the process of inquiry via the
empirical method to help us explore those situations, consider possible
courses of action, and test out various solutions. It is inquiry that
helps us to understand, act upon, and reconstruct our environments and
our experiences so that we are able to move forward out of the
indeterminate situation. In a richly cognitive and often social
practice, [inquiry invokes curiosity and problem solving to move us out
of ruts]{.underline}. Indeed, [[this method **combats the stagnation of
fatalism** by urging us to **formulate and try out
solutions**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Growth describes how reconstructions
of our experiences through inquiry develops physical, intellectual, and
moral capacities, actualizing them and helping them inform one another
so that they continue in a chain that enables one to **live
satisfactorily**]{.underline}. [We **grow** when we learn from inquiry
into indeterminate situations [and]{.mark} **create ways to
[re-establish smooth living]{.mark}** that carries us from one activity
to the next]{.underline}. [Many people **wrongly assume** that
growth]{.underline} necessarily [has an **end**]{.underline}---as if it
were "movement toward a fixed goal." 18 We tend to think of growth as
only progression toward some specific outcome, such as mastering bicycle
riding or graduating from high school. [But this way of thinking tends
to place the emphasis on the static terminus, **rather** than focusing
on the **process** of growing as **itself educative and
worthwhile**]{.underline}. [Dewey's alternative view]{.underline} of
growth [does not neatly and linearly move toward a fixed
goal]{.underline}. [Instead,]{.underline} he describes
[trajectories]{.underline} that [are more complicated]{.underline},
often [shifting with the environment]{.underline}. Moreover, [holding
onto a fixed goal may be undesirable because doing so employs a limited
or possibly foreclosed vision of the future]{.underline}. Instead, [as
changes occur in one's environment]{.underline}, Dewey asserts that
[people must continually inquire into moments of uncertainty and
changing circumstances, develop new hypotheses about those situations,
and revise their aims]{.underline}. Dewey works with what he calls
["ends-in-view," which are relatively close and feasible, even if
difficult to achieve, rather than overarching goals at some final
endpoint in the future]{.underline}. Those ends-in-view guide our
decisions and hypotheses along the way, [keeping us resourceful in the
present]{.underline}. In Dewey's words, the discovery of how things do
occur makes it possible to conceive of their happening at will, and
gives us a start on selecting and combining the conditions, the means,
[to command their happening]{.underline}...[there must be a realistic
study of actual conditions and the mode or law of natural
event]{.underline}, in order [to give the imagined or ideal object
definite form and solid substance]{.underline}---to give it, in short,
[practicality and constitute it as a working end]{.underline}. 19 For
Dewey, [ends and means are intelligently considered in **light of each
other**, with both being **revisable**, and neither **abstracted** from
the other]{.underline}. [Each fulfilled end-in-view sustains our hope by
highlighting meaningful headway and directing our further
action]{.underline}. [Ends-in-view later become means to future ends,
working in an ongoing continuum]{.underline}. [[This **sustenance of
hope** differs from theological accounts which are **difficult to
sustain** on faith alone]{.mark} and may leave believers **frustrated**
at an apparent lack of action or improvement]{.underline}. It also
differs from positive psychology and grit literature which tends to
focus on large, far-off, and challenging goals that one holds
tenaciously. [Many people think of hope as goal-directed and
future-oriented]{.underline}. [While objects of hope for pragmatists may
temporarily serve as ends-in-view, the practice of hope moves us forward
through inquiry and experimentation as we pursue our complicated
trajectory]{.underline}. [It helps to unify our past, present, and
future]{.underline}. [Hope]{.underline}, then, [is not just about a
vision of the future, but rather a way of living in the present that is
informed by the past and what is anticipated to come]{.underline}.
[Whereas utopian views of what could be may actually immobilize one and
may exhaust one in the present, **[pragmatist hope is always tied to
what one]{.mark} is doing and [feasibly can do in the present]{.mark}**,
especially when equipped with knowledge of the past]{.underline}.
Central to pragmatist philosophy, [ideas become true insofar as they
"work" for us, fruitfully combine our experiences, and lead us to
further experiences that satisfy our needs]{.underline}. [Pragmatists
are concerned with the concrete differences in our lived experiences
that an idea's being true will make]{.underline}. [Pragmatic truth
expresses "the successful completing of a worthwhile
leading."]{.underline} 20 Unlike truth as a corresponding match between
proposition and reality, [pragmatist truth]{.underline} is something
that [occurs when the goals of human flourishing are
satisfied]{.underline}, at least temporarily. Built into these criteria
is consideration of the well-being of others, for successful leading
through experiences almost always necessarily requires working and
communicating with others. Additionally, the differences an idea will
make are quite limited, and therefore less truthful, if relevant only to
one person. While not a comprehensive vision of the good life, [certain
norms including equality and just communication are entailed both in
these deliberations and the determination of truth]{.underline}. 21 We
must consider how to flourish alongside others as we craft our
ends-in-view. This differs considerably from other philosophical and
psychological accounts of hope based on the desire of objects or states
of affairs regardless of whether they are good for us or other people.
Meliorism Pragmatists like Dewey recognize the difficulty of present
circumstances, yet approach them practically, rather than
idealistically, with thoughtful action, believing that circumstances can
be improved. 22 Unlike simple optimists, however, they do not hold that
the situation will necessarily work out for the best, but rather they
believe people should make efforts to contribute to better outcomes.
Such efforts are rarely undertaken alone, instead they are tied to
others who are working together to solve problems. In the words of
contemporary pragmatist Cornel West, "Optimism adopts the role of the
spectator who surveys the evidence in order to infer that things are
going to get better. Yet when we know that the evidence does not look
good...Hope enacts the stance of the participant who actively struggles
against the evidence." 23 Meliorism entails action in the face of
difficulties. [Dewey sees hope as a way of living aligned with
meliorism, "the idea that at least there is a sufficient basis of
goodness in life and its conditions so that by thought and earnest
effort we may constantly make better things."]{.underline} 24
[[Meliorism is **not a belief in inevitable progress**, but]{.mark}
rather [a call to]{.mark} human [action, especially in the midst of
struggle and uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dewey firmly argued that
[it would be foolish to believe that there is "an automatic and
wholesale progress in human affairs,"]{.underline} insisting instead
that [betterment "depends upon **deliberative human foresight** and
**socially constructive work**."]{.underline} 25 Martin Luther King, a
champion and practitioner of hope, was enshrined on the floor of Obama's
oval office with his phrase: "The arc of the moral universe is long, but
it bends toward justice." Importantly, given how many hopes fell flat
under the messianic figure of Obama, King later explained in a
pragmatist spirit of meliorism, "[[Human progress never rolls on wheels
of inevitability; it comes through the **tireless
efforts**]{.underline}]{.mark} of men willing to be co-workers with God,
and [without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces
of social stagnation]{.underline}. [[We must **use time
creatively**]{.mark}, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to
do right]{.underline}." 26 We cannot wait until we have a clear picture
of our final future goals; rather, [we must act now in intelligent ways
and through inquiry [to bring about better conditions and]{.mark},
thereby,]{.underline} truth. [27 And we must [be]{.mark} flexible to
change and redirect our efforts as they unfold]{.underline}. [Meliorism
is [an **alternative to both pessimism and
optimism**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It cultivates
**hope**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, **growth**, [and **better
worlds**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For some pragmatists, like Colin Koopman,
this meliorism-based hope is "[the pragmatist affect par
excellence]{.underline}: '[hope is the **mood of
meliorism**]{.underline}' (27), '[the characteristic attitude of
pragmatism is hope']{.underline} (17)." 28

Beyond the important findings obtained for racial discrimination and
social support, [we found clear and consistent evidence for the distinct
and central role of hope agency in accounting for both positive and
negative psychological adjustment, independent of differences in
sociodemographic factors, experiences of racial discrimination, and
social support]{.underline}. Specifically, [[African Americans who
believed that they had the ability to achieve their goals reported lower
levels of anxious and depressive symptoms, and higher]{.mark} levels of
vitality and [life satisfaction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interestingly, in
contrast to Snyder et al.'s (1991) contention that both hope agency and
pathways uniquely contribute to psychological adjustment, we failed to
find compelling evidence for the unique role of hope pathways in
accounting for psychological adjustment in African Americans. However,
one exception was found. [In accounting for vitality, we found that
[feeling alive was predicated on African Americans' belief in]{.mark}
both their [ability to achieve]{.mark} personal [goals]{.mark} and their
ability to pursue effective means to reach those goals]{.underline}.
[Although some researchers have argued that the primary component
driving the positive effects of hope is agentic thinking]{.underline}
(Tong et al. 2010), [rather than a combination of agentic and pathways
thinking, it is important to appreciate that there has not been enough
studies conducted on hope in African Americans to draw any strong
conclusions at this time]{.underline} (Chang and Banks 2007). For
example, in contrast to the present findings, Davidson et al. (2010)
found that [hope pathways, but not agency, accounted for suicidal
ideation in African American college students attending a leadership
conference]{.underline}. Thus, there is a need for more studies that
examine the role of hope components across a wider spectrum of positive
and negative psychological adjustment outcomes in African Americans.
Nonetheless, [the present findings do offer some opportunity to consider
the usefulness of bolstering hope agency among African American adults
with low hope]{.underline}. According to Adams et al. (2003), [teaching
African Americans to cope effectively with life challenges and
threats]{.underline} (e.g., racial discrimination) [represents one
approach to facilitating hope]{.underline}. Relatedly, [[applying
problem-solving therapy]{.underline}]{.mark} (D'Zurilla and Nezu 2006)
[techniques [that help African Americans]{.mark} to [reframe]{.mark} or
reimagine their [problems as solvable or manageable]{.mark} (i.e.,
increase positive problem orientation and decrease negative problem
orientation) and [to engage in greater approach
behaviors]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., reduce avoidance behaviors)
[[toward resolving]{.mark} their [problems]{.mark}, may prove [useful in
building agentic thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alternatively, or
additionally, there might also be value in directly targeting hope in
African American adults. For example, in a pilot study of hope therapy
in a community sample of adults, Cheavens et al. (2006) showed that [an
eight-session intervention targeting core elements of hope theory (e.g.,
setting personal goals, developing pathways to work toward goals, and
cultivating personal sources of motivation) was effective in producing
significantly greater agentic thinking, between pre- and
post-treatment]{.underline}. Moreover, [it would be useful to determine
if [the building of hope]{.mark} in African Americans]{.underline} (as
well as in other ethnoracial groups) [[might]{.mark} also serve to
[buttress existing strategies to]{.mark} treat or [reduce psychological
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., depression, anxiety; Chang et al.
2018). Within this context, however, we join Lopez et al. (2000) in
arguing that [the cultivation of hope should be based on a foundation in
which efforts have been first made to "level" social disparities and
differences across individuals of all ethnoracial
backgrounds]{.underline}. That is, [what value is there in bolstering
hope in individuals if efforts are also not made to acknowledge and
change the social conditions that might have led their loss of hope in
the first place]{.underline} (Prilleltensky 1989)?

#### Specifically it prevents suicide -- we cite the *[best]{.underline}* study 

**Davidson et al 2010** (Collin L. Davidson, MS, LaRicka R. Wingate,
PhD, Meredith L. Slish, MS, and Kathy A. Rasmussen, MS, \"The Great
Black Hope: Hope and Its Relation to Suicide Risk among African
Americans\", Suice and Life-Threatening Behavior, 40(2) April 2010, The

mmv)

The results from this study are generally consistent with our
hypotheses. Specifically, [hope negatively predicted thwarted
belongingness and perceived burdensomeness while predicting acquired
capability to enact suicide in the positive direction]{.underline}.
[These results suggest that as a whole, [hope]{.mark} may serve to
[buffer African American]{.mark} individuals [against suicide]{.mark},
consistent with previous findings in other ethnic groups]{.underline}
(Davidson et al., in press; Range & Penton, 1994). As discussed above
and in a previous study (Davidson et al., in press), [the marginal
positive prediction of hope for acquired capability to enact suicide may
be [due to]{.mark} the [tendency of people with]{.mark} high [hopes to
set]{.mark} more [goals]{.mark} and more challenging goals, thus
possibly putting themselves in more situations where they would be
likely to experience pain]{.underline}. If the experience of pain became
frequent enough, these individuals would theoretically habituate to the
pain resulting in higher levels of acquired capability to enact suicide.
Further, [it was found that hope and the pathways subscale significantly
predicted suicidal ideation such that higher hope scores predicted less
suicidal ideation]{.underline}. In contrast, the goals and agency
subscales did not significantly predict suicidal ideation. This suggests
that simply having the goal or agency to enact suicide is not
enough---the strength of the relationship is in the pathway or plans to
enact suicide. This is consistent with previous research that has shown
that plans and preparations for suicide are one of the strongest
predictors for suicide completion (Joiner, Rudd, & Rajah, 1997);
stronger even than the desire to enact suicide. These findings may
relate to the significant prediction of the pathways component to
suicidal ideation. Taken [together with the aforementioned results, this
suggests that [hope serves as a protective factor for both suicidal
risk]{.mark} as described [in the interpersonal-psychological theory of
suicide]{.mark}]{.underline} (Joiner, 2005) [[and suicidal
ideation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These results are contrary to previous
findings]{.underline} (Davidson et al., in press) [which showed that
although higher hope did predict lower burdensomeness and thwarted
belongingness, hope did not predict suicidal ideation]{.underline}. It
is possible that, [[among African Americans, hope plays a larger role as
a protective factor]{.mark} for suicide [in comparison to a]{.mark}
predominantly [Caucasian sample]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, we
investigated the differences between the two samples and [found that the
African American sample had significantly higher levels of hope, goals,
and agency and that each of these scales had larger standard deviations
than the predominantly Caucasian sample]{.underline}. It is possible
that [the larger variability of scores contributed to the likelihood of
significant findings]{.underline}. Future research should aim to clarify
this relationship. Finally, consistent with our third hypothesis, it was
found that the components of Joiners (2005) theory of suicidal behavior
together predicted suicidal ideation. These results offer further
support for the validity of Joiners theory in conjunction with the
existing empirical studies that support this theory. Additionally, these
results further expand the generalizability of Joiner\'s theory to an
African American sample. Although the components as a set predicted
suicidal ideation, when examined individually, only burden-someness and
belongingness individually predict suicidal ideation, while acquired
capability does not. This finding is not consistent with a previous
study that examined the theory in a largely Caucasian population (David-
son et al., in press), wherein each component separately predicted
suicidal ideation. Joiner proposed that for an individual to desire
suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness must be
elevated, whereas for an individual to physically carry out a suicide
attempt, they must have higher acquired capability to enact suicide.
Theoretically then, it may be that individuals who only have elevated
levels of acquired capability may not have suicidal ideation because
they have no desire to end their lives. Again, future research should
further investigate this relationship. One limitation of the current
study is that the [sample]{.underline} is not particularly diverse, as
it [is composed only of people who self-identified as African
American]{.underline}. However, it is of note that this is the first
study to our knowledge to examine Joiners theory of suicidal behavior in
an African American sample. It is ideal to generalize the presence of
theoretical findings to many different populations. Regarding this
situation. Popper (1959, p. 269) stated, \"once a theory is well
corroborated, further instances raise its degree of corroboration only
very little. This ride however does not hold good if these new instances
are very different from the earlier ones, that is if they corroborate
the theory in a new field of application\" (emphasis added). [Although
the participants in this study were African American, they were somewhat
diverse in their place of living, and came from all over the Big XII
conference area, including the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,
Missouri, Iowa, Texas, and Colorado]{.underline}. In line with the
previous limitation, it is important to note that there is a great
amount of diversity among Black people, lo elaborate, there are cultural
differences related to the geographic location in which a person lives
(all of our participants were living in the midwest), as well as their
ethnic heritage and recent ancestors\' country of origin (United States,
Africa, Caribbean Islands, etc.). Given the heterogeneity among Black
people in America, it is important that researchers attend to ethnic
differences among Blacks in the study of suicide related behaviors.
Future studies should work to investigate risk factors within Black
groups. Some may consider the focus on a relatively low-risk group of
participants (African American college students) a limitation of our
study; however, a great deal of research on suicidal behavior and risk
factors has been conducted with college samples. In addition, we
specifically took the stance of examining suicidal behavior from a
positive psychology approach, as suggested in Wingate et al. (2006).
Given that the rate of suicide for African Americans has been
consistendy low in comparison to Caucasian Americans, it may be
beneficial to identify the protective factors that help to temper the
risk. Once these protective factors are identified in African Americans,
it may then be possible to implement and encourage these factors in
other ethnic groups. This emphasis on buffers against suicide risk may
serve to supplement the existing emphasis on suicide risk factors in
clinical practice. Indeed, [research has shown that hope tends to
protect individuals from negative outcomes in mental health]{.underline}
(e.g., depression and anxiety) [and the current study and previous
studies have suggested that hope can also protect against suicide
risk]{.underline} (Davidson et al, in press; Range & Penton, 1994). [It
is possible that instilling hope in clients can provide incremental
increases in client safety\' above and beyond the common clinical
practices of identifying and protecting clients from risk factors to
ensure their safety\']{.underline}. Indeed, Stellrecht et al. (2006)
highlighted the importance of applying research to the clinical setting
and provided recommendations for using the interpersonal-psychological
theory of suicide in risk assessment, crisis intervention, and general
therapy. [Specific to African Americans, it may prove beneficial for
clinicians to use techniques that encourage increased feelings of
belongingness within, and contributions to, the African American
community. This could include having the client become involved in
activities where they are a member of a group, where they give back, and
where they have similarities to others in the group]{.underline}.
Cognitive techniques could be used to address distorted cognitions
surrounding feelings of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness.
Similarly, drawing from hope theory, [clinicians may be able to focus on
challenging cognitive distortions related to a lack of hope, subsequendy
increasing hope as a protective factor]{.underline}. They may also be
able to capitalize on the hope that clients already possess when
presenting to therapy, and work to generalize that hope to areas of the
clients life where it is lacking. Though the current findings may inform
prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior in the future, it should
be noted that additional research is required to confirm some of these
potential applications. The findings from the current study are
important in that they replicate and extend the findings of Davidson et
al. (in press), which demonstrated that hope served as a protective
factor for suicide risk in a largely Caucasian sample. [As mentioned
earlier, African Americans tend to be at higher risk for suicide due to
overrepresentation in lower socioeconomic-status environments,
associated stress, and discrimination, but they enact suicide at lower
rates]{.underline}. Some researchers have hypothesized (see Gibbs, 1997)
that this paradox is due to protective factors such as religiosity or
strong family ties. [The current study adds to these assertions by
demonstrating that [hope is]{.mark} potentially [an important protective
factor]{.mark} for African Americans]{.underline}. To our knowledge,
[[this is the only study that has investigated suicide from a positive
psychology perspective in an African American sample, and one of few
studies to do so in a general sample]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Structuralism is [self-defeating]{.underline} and [contradictory]{.underline}.

**Carey 20** -- School of Humanities and Social Inquiry, University of
Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia. (Jane, \"On hope and resignation:
conflicting visions of settler colonial studies and its future as a
field,\" Taylor & Francis, 2-12-2020,

Accessed 5-23-2021, LASA-SC)

In support of this claim he asserted: 'For the practitioners of the
[[eliminationist paradigm,]{.underline}]{.mark} [Indigenous agency tends
to be a gesture made at the end of a description of the settler colonial
edifice'.]{.underline} **[Problematically,]{.underline}** however, as I
detail further below, [this assertion fundamentally misrepresented most
of the works he cited]{.underline}. Neither Maynard nor Langton
responded particularly to Rowse's comments, perhaps expecting that
Indigenous perspectives should be the main focus of the panel.11 A
reworked version of Rowse's paper was published the following year in
Australian Historical Studies as part of a forum which included two
responses to his article. Neither of the Indigenous scholars who had
been part of the original conference panel were represented in this
forum.12 The journal's editorial for this issue described the session as
having been 'framed by Professor Tim Rowse's discussion of the term
"settler colonialism", and whether it actually could be said, in its
various uses, to partly occlude the histories of Indigenous peoples,
thereby further silencing their lives in the past'. 13 The presence of
Maynard and Langton on the original conference panel was not mentioned.
In this move, both Rowse and the journal neatly enacted the very thing
he was purporting to critique: **[Indigenous erasure]{.underline}**.
Although the published version contained some significant alterations,
[Rowse's central critique]{.underline} remained the claim that '[those
writing within this paradigm [have trouble dealing with Indigenous
agency']{.mark}.]{.underline} He decried 'the **[[homogenising,]{.mark}
psychologising and dehistoricising]{.underline}** [[tendencies]{.mark}
of the "elimination" paradigm' as unhelpful and characterised its
'analytical ambition' as being the [establish]{.mark}ment of
'[the]{.mark} teleological [sameness]{.mark} of all [narratives of
colonisation']{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 In outlining his vision of
Indigenous heterogeneity, he suggested that [Australia's colonial
history had produced 'opportunities' for Indigenous survival, in 'a self
conscious series of enclaves']{.underline}, and thus called into
question those who presented colonisation as 'displacement,
dispossession and destruction'. Leaving aside the extraordinary claim
that colonialism produced Indigenous survival (rather than being the
force that required survival), he argued that [[historians]{.mark}
should [have more to say about]{.mark} **[Indigenous
persistence]{.mark}** than about erasure]{.underline}. In Rowse's view,
any engagement with Wolfe's work necessarily foreclosed this
possibility. Rowse presented his critique as a major new intervention;
but he was, in fact, repeating criticisms that had already been widely
aired since the late 1990s. As anyone with more than a passing
familiarity with the field knows, [Wolfe's work sparked controversy and
critique from his earliest publications]{.underline}. His 1994 article
in Social Analysis, 'Nation and MiscegeNation', which contained the
first major statement of his structuralist interpretation of the nature
of settler colonialism, provoked a 'Review Symposium' in the same
journal in 1997.15 This featured three critical responses from Elizabeth
Povinelli, Francesca Merlan and Jeffrey Sissons. These [[critiques
questioned]{.mark} Wolfe's thesis **regarding the '[structural
continuity' of settler colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} from a number
of directions, but most particularly the way it [seemed to risk
[foreclos]{.mark}ing the possibility of [Indigenous
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}. Merlan's response was the most critical,
[[rejecting structuralist models]{.mark} in general, and the
implications of Wolfe's thesis for Aboriginal agency
specifically]{.underline}: '[[In centring the]{.mark} notion of a
continuous [logic of settler-colonialism]{.mark},]{.underline} [and
regarding this as a "structure rather than an event",]{.underline}
[**[Wolfe succumbs to the]{.mark} appealing [closure of all
structuralisms]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and constitutes this logic as
impervious to agency and event']{.underline}. This, she argued,
'effectively [[denies Aborigines and others entry points' and reduced
past]{.mark} and present '[to a logic of elimination]{.mark} in which
Aborigines have no part']{.underline}. 16 Povinelli, while supporting
aspects of Wolfe's analysis, also noted how his model seemingly
[positioned Aboriginal people]{.underline}'s own accounts of 'the hybrid
nature of colonial subjectivity' as 'assimilationist' and worse
[as]{.underline} '**[[participating ... in the]{.mark} completion of the
[colonial project]{.mark}]{.underline}** of (sub)merging and eliminating
Aboriginal people'. 17 Jeffrey Sissons concurred with much of Merlan's
critique, but argued that this called for an expansion of Wolfe's
argument rather than a rejection of it and that 'the bracketing or
deferral of Aboriginal agency does not necessarily preclude its
recuperation at some later point'. 18 While Sissons thus supported much
of Wolfe's analysis, he expressed reservations that [the [model]{.mark}
[did not account for]{.mark} [differences between settler
colonies]{.mark} and]{.underline} (in the well-trodden vein of New
Zealand exceptionalism) [argued that in [New Zealand]{.mark}, 'colonial
settlers [sought assimilation]{.mark} rather than elimination of
Maori']{.underline}. That is, he did not accept Wolfe's view that
assimilation was a settler strategy of elimination. He particularly
[[reject]{.mark}ed [Wolfe's characterisation of]{.mark} the
[ongoing,]{.mark} present-day salience of these
[structures]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark} '[No one could reasonably
argue ... that the New Zealand State's strategies conform to a logic of
elimination]{.underline} and nor, I suggest, can this be convincingly
argued for the post-colonizing Australian state'. 19

#### Repression, free association, and transference are all statistically and empirically disproven -- undercuts the fundamental thesis of psychoanalysis

**Grunbaum, 2005 (Adolf, Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy at the
University of Pittsburgh, "Critique of Psychoanalysis," Handbook of
Personology and Psychopathology, edited by Stephen Strack)**

Let me now turn to my critique of **the core of Freud's
original psychoanalytic theory** and to a verdict on its fundamental
modifications by two major post-Freudian sets of hypotheses, called self
psychology and object relations theory. **The pillars of the** avowed
"**cornerstone" of Freud's theoretical edifice comprise several major
theses: (1) Distressing mental states induce** the operation of a
psychic mechanism of **repression, which consists in the banishment from
consciousness of unpleasurable psychic states** (1915b, p.
147); (2) **once repression is operative** (more or less fully), **it
not only banishes such negatively charged ideas from consciousness, but
plays a further crucial multiple causal role: It is causally necessary
for the pathogens of neuroses, the production of our dreams, and the
generation of our various sorts of slips (bungled
actions); and** (3) **the "method of free association" can identify and
lift (undo) the patient's repressions; by doing so, it can identify the
pathogens of the neuroses, and the generators of our dreams, as well as
the causes of our motivationally opaque slips; moreover, by lifting the
pathogenic repressions, free association functions therapeutically,
rather than only investigatively**. Freud provided two sorts of
arguments for his cardinal etiologic doctrine that repressions are the
pathogens of the neuroses: His earlier one, which goes back to his
original collaboration with Josef Breuer, relies on
purported *therapeutic successes* from lifting repressions; the later
one, designed to show that the pathogenic repressions are sexual, is
drawn from presumed reenactments ("transferences") of infantile episodes
in the adult patient's interactions with the analyst during
psychoanalytic treatment. It will be expositorily expeditious to deal
with Freud's earlier etiologic argument below, and to appraise the
subsequent one, which goes back to his "Dora" case history of 1905,
after that. But also for expository reasons, it behooves us to devote an
introduction to his account of the actuation of the hypothesized
mechanism of repression by "motives of unpleasure." Negative Affect and
Forgetting As Freud told us, "**The theory of repression is the
cornerstone on which the whole structure of psycho-analysis rests. It is
the most essential part of it**" (1914, p. 16). The process of
repression, which consists in the banishment of ideas from consciousness
or in denying them entry into it, is itself presumed to be unconscious
(1915b, p. 147). **In Freud's view, our neurotic symptoms, the manifest
contents of our dreams, and the slips we commit are each constructed as
"compromises between the demands of a repressed impulse and the
resistances of a censoring force in the ego**" (1925, p. 45; and
1916--1917, p. 301). **By being only such compromises, rather than
fulfillments of the instinctual impulses, these products of the
unconscious afford only substitutive gratifications or outlets. For
brevity, one can say, therefore, that Freud has offered a unifying
"compromise model" of neuroses, dreams, and parapraxes. But what, in the
first place, is the motive or cause that initiates and sustains the
operation of the unconscious mechanism of repression before it produces
its own later effects? Apparently, Freud assumes axiomatically that
distressing mental states, such as forbidden wishes, trauma, disgust,
anxiety, anger, shame, hate, guilt, and sadness---all of which are
unpleasurable---almost always actuate, and then fuel, forgetting to the
point of repression. Thus, repression regulates pleasure and unpleasure
by defending our consciousness against various sorts of negative
affect**. Indeed, Freud claimed perennially that repression is the
paragon among our defense mechanisms (Thomä & Kächele, 1987, pp.
107--111). **As Freud put it dogmatically: "The tendency to forget what
is disagreeable seems to me to be a quite universal one**" (1901, p.
144), and "The recollection of distressing impressions and the
occurrence of distressing thoughts are opposed by a resistance" (p.
146). Freud tries to disarm an important objection to his thesis that
"distressing memories succumb especially easily to motivated forgetting"
(1901, p. 147, italics added). He says: "The assumption that a defensive
trend of this kind exists cannot be objected to on the ground that one
often enough finds it impossible, on the contrary, to get rid of
distressing memories that pursue one, and to banish distressing
affective impulses like remorse and the pangs of conscience. For we are
not asserting that this defensive trend is able to put itself into
effect in every case." **He acknowledges as "also a true fact" that
"distressing things are particularly hard to forget**" (1916--1917, pp.
76--77). For instance, we know from Charles **Darwin's** autobiography
that his **father had developed a remarkably retentive memory for
painful experiences** (cited in Grünbaum, 1994), **and that a half
century after Giuseppe Verdi was humiliatingly denied admission to the
Milan Music Conservatory, he recalled it indignantly** (Walker, 1962,
pp. 8--9). Freud himself told us as an adult (1900, p. 216) that he "can
remember very clearly," from age 7 or 8, how his father rebuked him for
having relieved himself in the presence of his parents in their bedroom.
In a frightful blow to Freud's ego, his father said: "The boy will come
to nothing." **But Freud's attempt here to uphold his thesis of
motivated forgetting is evasive and unavailing: Because some painful
mental states are vividly remembered while others are forgotten or even
repressed, I claim that factors different from their painfulness
determine whether they are remembered or forgotten. For example,
personality dispositions or situational variables may in fact be
causally relevant. To the great detriment of his theory, Freud never
came to grips with the unfavorable bearing of this key fact about the
mnemic effects of painfulness on the tenability of the following pillar
of his theory of repression: When painful or forbidden experiences are
forgotten, the forgetting is tantamount to their repression due to their
negative affect, and thereby produces neurotic symptoms or other
compromise formations**. Thomas **Gilovich**, a professor of psychology
at Cornell University, **is** now **doing valuable work on the
conditions under which painful experiences are remembered and on those
other conditions under which they are forgotten. The numerous and
familiar occurrences of vivid and even obsessive recall of negative
experiences pose a fundamental statistical and explanatory challenge to
Freud that neither he nor his followers have ever met. We must
ask** (Grünbaum, 1994): **Just what is the ratio of the forgetting of
distressing experiences to their recall, and what other factors
determine that ratio? Freud gave no statistical evidence for assuming
that forgetting them is the rule and remembering them is the
exception**. Yet, as we can see, **his theory of repression is
devastatingly undermined from the outset if forgettings of negative
experiences do not greatly outnumber rememberings statistically. After
all, if forgetting is not the rule, then what other reason does Freud
offer for supposing that when distressing experiences are actually
forgotten, these forgettings are instances of genuine repression due to
affective displeasure? And if he has no such other reason, then, a
fortiori, he has no basis at all for his pivotal etiologic scenario that
forbidden or aversive states of mind are usually repressed and thereby
cause compromise formations**. Astonishingly, Freud thinks he can parry
this basic statistical and explanatory challenge by an evasive dictum,
as follows: "Mental life is the arena and battle-ground for mutually
opposing purposes \[of forgetting and remembering\] (1916--1917, p. 76)
. . . ; there is room for both. It is only a question . . . of what
effects are produced by the one and the other" (p. 77). Indeed, just
that question cries out for an answer from Freud if he is to make his
case. Instead, he cavalierly left it to dangle epistemologically in
limbo. The Epistemological Liabilities of the Psychoanalytic Method of
Free Association **Another basic difficulty, which besets all three
major branches of the theory of repression alike, lies in the
epistemological defects of Freud's so-called fundamental rule of free
association, the supposed microscope and X-ray tomograph of the human
mind. This rule enjoins the patient to tell the analyst without
reservation whatever comes to mind. Thus, it serves as the fundamental
method of clinical investigation. We are told that by using this
technique to unlock the floodgates of the unconscious, Freud was able to
show that neuroses, dreams, and slips are caused by repressed motives**.
Just as in Breuer's cathartic use of hypnosis, **it is a cardinal thesis
of Freud's entire psychoanalytic enterprise that his method of free
association has a twofold major capability, which is both investigative
and therapeutic: (1) It can identify the unconscious causes of human
thoughts and behavior, both abnormal and normal, and (2) by overcoming
resistances and lifting repressions, it can remove the unconscious
pathogens of neuroses and thus provide therapy for an important class of
mental disorders. But on what grounds did Freud assert that free
association has the stunning investigative capability to be causally
probative for etiologic research in psychopathology? Is it not too good
to be true that one can put a psychologically disturbed person on the
couch and fathom the etiology of her or his affliction by free
association? As compared to fathoming the causation of major somatic
diseases, that seems almost miraculous, if at all true**. Freud tells us
very clearly (1900, p. 528) that his argument for his investigative
tribute to free association as a means of uncovering the causation of
neuroses is, at bottom, a therapeutic one going back to the cathartic
method of treating hysteria. Let me state and articulate his argument.
One of Freud's justifications for the use of free association as a
causally probative method of dream investigation leading to the
identification of the repressed dream thoughts, he tells us (1900, p.
528), is that it "is identical with the procedure \[of free
association\] by which we resolve hysterical symptoms; and there the
correctness of our method \[of free association\] is warranted by the
coincident emergence and disappearance of the symptoms." But, as I have
pointed out elsewhere (Grünbaum, 1993, pp. 25--26), his original German
text here contains a confusing slip of the pen. As we know, the
patient's symptoms hardly first emerge simultaneously with their
therapeutic dissipation. Yet, Strachey translated Freud correctly as
having spoken of "the coincident emergence and disappearance of the
symptoms." It would seem that Freud means to speak of the resolution
(German: Auflösung), rather than of the emergence (Auftauchen), of the
symptoms as coinciding with their therapeutic dissipation. Now, for
Freud, the "resolution of a symptom," in turn, consists of using free
association to uncover the repressed pathogen that enters into the
compromise formation that is held to constitute the symptom. This much,
then, is the statement of Freud's appeal to therapeutic success to vouch
for the "correctness of our method" of free association as causally
probative for etiologic research in psychopathology. To articulate the
argument adequately, however, we must still clarify Freud's original
basis for claiming that (unsuccessful) repression is indeed the pathogen
of neurosis. Only then will he have made his case for claiming that free
association is etiologically probative because it is uniquely capable of
uncovering repressions. The pertinent argument is offered in Breuer and
Freud's "Preliminary Communication" (1893, pp. 6--7). There they wrote:
"For we found, to our great surprise at first, that each individual
hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had
succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which
it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect, and when the
patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had
put the affect into words. Recollection without affect almost invariably
produces no result. The psychical process which originally took place
must be repeated as vividly as possible; it must be brought back to its
status nascendi and then given verbal utterance." Breuer and Freud make
an important comment on their construal of this therapeutic finding: "It
is plausible to suppose that it is a question here of unconscious
suggestion: the patient expects to be relieved of his sufferings by this
procedure, and it is this expectation, and not the verbal utterance,
which is the operative factor. This, however, is not so. (p. 7)" And
their avowed reason is that, in 1881, that is, in the " 'pre-suggestion'
era," the cathartic method was used to remove separately distinct
symptoms, "which sprang from separate causes" such that any one symptom
disappeared only after the cathartic ("abreactive") lifting of a
particular repression. But Breuer and Freud do not tell us why the
likelihood of placebo effect should be deemed to be lower when several
symptoms are wiped out seriatim than in the case of getting rid of only
one symptom. Thus, as I have pointed out elsewhere (Grünbaum, 1993, p.
238), to discredit the hypothesis of placebo effect, it would have been
essential to have comparisons with treatment outcome from a suitable
control group whose repressions are not lifted. If that control group
were to fare equally well, treatment gains from psychoanalysis would
then be placebo effects after all. In sum, Breuer and Freud inferred
that the therapeutic removal of neurotic symptoms was produced by the
cathartic lifting of the patient's previously ongoing repression of the
pertinent traumatic memory, not by the therapist's suggestion or some
other placebo factor (see Grünbaum, 1993, pp. 69--107 for a very
detailed analysis of the placebo concept). We can codify this claim as
follows: *T. Therapeutic Hypothesis: Lifting repressions of traumatic
memories cathartically is causally relevant to the disappearance of
neuroses*. As we saw, Breuer and Freud (1893, p. 6) reported the
immediate and permanent disappearance of each hysterical symptom after
they cathartically lifted the repression of the memory of the trauma
that occasioned the given symptom. They adduce this "evidence" to draw
an epoch-making inductive etiologic inference, which postulates "a
causal relation between the determining \[repression of the memory of
the\] psychical trauma and the hysterical phenomenon" (p. 6). Citing the
old scholastic dictum "Cessante causa cessat effectus" (When the cause
ceases, its effect ceases), they invoke its contrapositive (p. 7), which
states that as long as the effect (symptom) persists, so does its cause
(the repressed memory of the psychical trauma). And they declare just
that to be the pattern of the pathogenic action of the repressed
psychical trauma. This trauma, we learn, is not a mere precipitating
cause. Such a mere "agent provocateur" just releases the symptom, "which
thereafter leads an independent existence." Instead, "the \[repressed\]
memory of the trauma . . . acts like a foreign body which long after its
entry must continue to be regarded as an agent that is still at work"
(p. 6). The upshot of their account is that their observations of
positive therapeutic outcome on the abreactive lifting of repressions,
which they interpret in the sense of their therapeutic hypothesis,
spelled a paramount etiologic moral as follows: *E. Etiologic
Hypothesis: An ongoing repression accompanied by affective suppression
is causally necessary for the initial pathogenesis and persistence of a
neurosis*. (This formulation of the foundational etiology of
psychoanalysis supersedes the one I gave at the suggestion of Carl
Hempel and Morris Eagle \[in Grünbaum, 1984, p. 181, last paragraph\].
The revised formulation here is faithful to Breuer and Freud's reference
to "accompanying affect" \[p. 6\] apropos of the traumatic events whose
repression occasioned the symptoms.) Clearly, this etiologic hypothesis
E permits the valid deduction of the therapeutic finding reported by
Breuer and Freud as codified in their therapeutic hypothesis T: The
cathartic lifting of the repressions of traumatic memories of events
that occasion symptoms engendered the disappearance of the symptoms.
And, as they told us explicitly (1893, p. 6**), this therapeutic finding
is their "evidence" for their cardinal etiologic hypothesis E. But I
maintain**[ that this inductive argument is vitiated by what I like to
call the "fallacy
of crude hypothetico-deductive (H-D) pseudo-confirmation." Thus, note
that the remedial action of aspirin consumption for tension headaches
does not lend H-D support to the outlandish etiologic hypothesis that a
hematolytic aspirin deficiency is a causal sine qua non for
having tension headaches, although such remedial action is validly
deducible from that bizarre hypothesis. Twenty-five years ago, Wesley
Salmon called attention to the fallacy of inductive causal inference
from mere valid H-D deducibility by giving an example in which a
deductively valid pseudo-explanation of a man's avoiding pregnancy can
readily give rise to an H-D pseudo-confirmation of the addle-brained
attribution of his nonpregnancy to his consumption of birth control
pills]{.underline}. Salmon (1971, p. 34) states the fatuous
pseudo-explanation: **"John Jones avoided becoming pregnant during the
past year, for he had taken his wife's birth control pills regularly,
and every man who regularly takes birth control pills avoids pregnancy."
Plainly, this deducibility of John Jones's recent failure to become
pregnant from the stated premises does not lend any credence at all to
the zany hypothesis that this absence of pregnancy is causally
attributable to his consumption of birth control pills. Yet it is even
true that any men who consume such pills in fact never do become
pregnant. Patently, as Salmon notes, the fly in the ointment is that men
just do not become pregnant, whether they take birth control pills or
not. His example shows that neither the empirical truth of the
deductively inferred conclusion and of the pertinent initial condition
concerning Jones nor the deductive validity of the inference can provide
bona fide confirmation of the causal hypothesis that male consumption of
birth control pills prevents male pregnancy: That hypothesis would first
have to meet other epistemic requirements, which it manifestly cannot
do. Crude H-D confirmationism is a paradise of spurious causal
inferences, as illustrated by Breuer and Freud's unsound etiologic
inference. Thus, psychoanalytic narratives are replete with the belief
that a hypothesized etiologic scenario embedded in a psychoanalytic
narrative of an analysand's affliction is made credible merely because
the postulated etiology then permits the logical deduction or
probabilistic inference of the neurotic symptoms to be explained**. Yet
some apologists offer a facile excuse for the fallacious H-D
confirmation of a causal hypothesis. We are told that the hypothesis is
warranted by an "Inference to the Best Explanation" (1965, pp. 88--95).
But in a careful new study, Wesley Salmon (2001, p. 79) has argued that
"**the characterization of nondemonstrative inference as inference to
the best explanation serves to muddy the waters . . . by fostering
confusion" between two sorts of why-questions that Hempel had
distinguished: explanation-seeking questions as to why something is the
case, and confirmation-seeking why-questions as to why a hypothesis is
credible**. Thus, a hypothesis that is pseudo-confirmed by some data
cannot be warranted qua being "the only \[explanatory\] game in town."
Alas, **"best explanation"---sanction was claimed for psychoanalytic
etiologies to explain and treat the destructive behavior of sociopaths
to no avail for years** (cf. Cleckley, 1988, pp. 238--239, 438--439). I
can now demonstrate the multiple failure of Freud's therapeutic argument
for the etiologic probativeness of free association in psychopathology,
no matter how revealing the associative contents may otherwise be in
regard to the patient's psychological preoccupations and personality
dispositions. Let us take our bearings and first encapsulate the
structure of his therapeutic argument. First, Freud inferred that the
therapeutic disappearance of the neurotic symptoms is causally
attributable to the cathartic lifting of repressions by means of the
method of free association. Relying on this key therapeutic hypothesis,
he then drew two further major theoretical inferences: (1) The seeming
removal of the neurosis by means of cathartically lifting repressions is
good inductive evidence for postulating that repressions accompanied by
affective suppression are themselves causally necessary for the very
existence of a neurosis (1893, pp. 6--7), and (2) granted that such
repressions are thus the essential causes of neurosis, and that the
method of free association is uniquely capable of uncovering these
repressions, this method is uniquely competent to identify the causes or
pathogens of the neuroses. (Having convinced himself of the causal
probativeness of the method of free association on therapeutic grounds
in the case of those neuroses he believed to be successfully treatable,
Freud also felt justified in deeming the method reliable as a means of
unearthing the etiologies of those other neuroses---the so-called
narcissistic ones, such as paranoia---that he considered
psychoanalytically untreatable.) **But the argument fails for the
following several reasons. In the first place, the durable therapeutic
success on which it was predicated did not materialize (Borch-Jacobsen,
1996), as Freud was driven to admit both early and very late in his
career (1925, p. 27; 1937, pp. 23, 216--253). But even insofar as there
was transitory therapeutic gain, we saw that Freud failed to rule out
a rival hypothesis that undermines his attribution of such gain to the
lifting of repressions by free association: the ominous hypothesis
of placebo effect, which asserts that treatment ingredients other than
insight into the patient's repression---such as the mobilization of the
patient's hope by the therapist---are responsible for any
resulting improvement (Grünbaum, 1993, chap. 3). Nor have other analysts
ruled out the placebo hypothesis during the past century. A case in
point is a 45-page study "On the Efficacy of Psychoanalysis" (Bachrach,
Galatzer, Skolnikoff, & Waldron, 1991), published in the official
Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Another is the
account of analytic treatment process by Vaughan and Roose
(1995)**. Last, but not least, the repression etiology is evidentially
ill founded, as we saw earlier and will see further in the next section.
It is unavailing to the purported etiologic probativeness of free
associations that they may lift repressions, because Freud failed to
show that the latter are pathogenic. In sum, Freud's argument has
forfeited its premises. Freud's Etiologic Transference Argument Now let
us consider Freud's argument for his cardinal thesis that sexual
repressions in particular are the pathogens of all neuroses, an argument
he deemed "decisive." Drawing on my earlier writings (Grünbaum, 1990,
pp. 565--567; 1993, pp. 152--158), we shall now find that this argument
is without merit. According to Freud's theory of transference, the
patient transfers onto his or her psychoanalyst feelings and thoughts
that originally pertained to important figures in his or her earlier
life. In this important sense, the fantasies woven around the
psychoanalyst by the analysand, and quite generally the latter's conduct
toward his or her doctor, are hypothesized to be thematically
recapitulatory of childhood episodes. And by thus being recapitulatory,
the patient's behavior during treatment can be said to exhibit a
thematic kinship to such very early episodes. Therefore, when the
analyst interprets these supposed reenactments, the ensuing
interpretations are called "transference interpretations." Freud and his
followers have traditionally drawn the following highly questionable
causal inference: Precisely in virtue of being thematically
recapitulated in the patientdoctor interaction, the hypothesized earlier
scenario in the patient's life can cogently be held to have originally
been a pathogenic factor in the patient's affliction. For example, in
his case history of the "Rat-Man," Freud (1909) infers that a certain
emotional conflict had originally been the precipitating cause of the
patient's inability to work, merely because this conflict had been
thematically reenacted in a fantasy the "Rat-Man" had woven around Freud
during treatment. Thus, in the context of Freud's transference
interpretations, the thematic reenactment is claimed to show that the
early scenario had originally been pathogenic. According to this
etiologic conclusion, the patient's thematic reenactment in the
treatment setting is also asserted to be pathogenically recapitulatory
by being pathogenic in the adult patient's here and now, rather than
only thematically recapitulatory. Freud (1914, p. 12) extols this
dubious etiologic transference argument in his History of the
Psycho-Analytic Movement, claiming that it furnishes the most unshakable
proof for his sexual etiology of all the neuroses: "The fact of the
emergence of the transference in its crudely sexual form, whether
affectionate or hostile, in every treatment of a neurosis, although this
is neither desired nor induced by either doctor or patient, has always
seemed to me the most irrefragable proof \[original German:
"unerschütterlichste Beweis"\] that the source of the driving forces of
neurosis lies in sexual life \[sexual repressions\]. This argument has
never received anything approaching the degree of attention that it
merits, for if it had, investigations in this field would leave no other
conclusion open. As far as I am concerned, this argument has remained
the decisive one, over and above the more specific findings of analytic
work." On the contrary, the patient's thematically recapitulatory
behavior toward his or her doctor does not show that it is also
pathogenically recapitulatory. How, for example, does the reenactment,
during treatment, of a patient's early conflict show at all that the
original conflict had been pathogenic in the first place? Quite
generally, how do transference phenomena focusing on the analyst show
that a presumed current replica of a past event is pathogenic in the
here and now? Therefore, I submit, the purportedly "irrefragable proof "
of which Freud spoke deserves more attention not because its
appreciation "would leave no other conclusion open," as he would have
it; instead, I contend that the "Rat-Man" case and other such case
histories show how baffling it is that Freud deemed the etiologic
transference argument cogent at all, let alone unshakably so. Marshall
Edelson (1984, p. 150) has offered a rebuttal to my denial of the
cogency of the etiologic transference argument: "In fact, in
psychoanalysis the pathogen is not merely a remote event, or a series of
such events, the effect of which lives on. The pathogen reappears in all
its virulence, with increasing frankness and explicitness, in the
transference---in a new edition, a new version, a reemergence, a
repetition of the past pathogenic events or factors." And Edelson
elaborates (p. 151): "The pathogen together with its pathological
effects are, therefore, under the investigator's eye, so to speak, in
the psychoanalytic situation, and demonstrating the causal relation
between them in that situation, by experimental or quasi-experimental
methods, surely provides support, even if indirect, for the hypothesis
that in the past the same kind of pathogenic factors were necessary to
bring about the same kind of effects." But how does the psychoanalyst
demonstrate, within the confines of his or her clinical setting, that
the supposed current replica of the remote, early event is presently the
virulent cause of the patient's neurosis, let alone that the original
pathogen is replicated at all in the transference? Having fallaciously
identified a conflict as a pathogen because it reappears in the
transference, many Freudians conclude that pathogens must reappear in
the transference. And in this way, they beg the key question I have just
asked. How, for example, did Freud show that the "Rat-Man's" marriage
conflict depicted in that patient's transference fantasy was the current
cause of his ongoing death obsessions? Neither Edelson's book nor his
1986 paper offers a better answer. Thus, in the latter, he declares:
"The psychoanalyst claims that current mental representations of
particular past events or fantasies are constitutive (i.e., current
operative) causes of current behavior, and then goes on to claim that
therefore past actual events or fantasies are etiological causes of the
analysand's symptoms." And Edelson concludes: "Transference phenomena
are . . . nonquestion-begging evidence for . . . inferences about
causally efficacious psychological entities existing or occurring in the
here and now. (p. 110)" **In sum, despite Edelson's best
efforts, the etiologic transference argument on which both Freud and he
rely is ill founded: (1) They employ epistemically circular
reasoning when inferring the occurrence of infantile episodes from the
adult patient's reports and then claiming that these early episodes are
thematically recapitulated in the adult analysand's conduct toward the
analyst; (2) they beg the etiologic question by inferring that, qua
being thematically recapitulated, the infantile episodes had been
pathogenic at the outset; and (3) they reason that the adult patient's
thematic reenactment is pathogenically recapitulatory such that the
current replica of the infantile episodes is pathogenic in the here and
now. Freud went on to build on the quicksand of
his etiologic transference argument. It inspired two of his
further fundamental tenets: first, the investigative thesis that the
psychoanalytic dissection of the patient's behavior toward the analyst
can reliably identify the original pathogens of his or her long-term
neurosis; second, the cardinal therapeutic doctrine that the working
through of the analysand's so-called transference neurosis is the key to
overcoming his or her perennial problems**.

#### Lacan is a charlatan

**Webster, 2002 (Richard, British author, journalist, and essayist, "The
cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the Mirror Stage,"
http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html)**

Lacan\'s bold decision to use the theories of Wallon in order to create
an idiosyncratic French version of psychoanalysis was undoubtedly one of
the factors which helped to attract influential supporters like Pichon.
Lacan\'s thirst for recognition was so great, however, that there was
never any chance of him remaining bound by any particular intellectual
marriage. He paid court to numerous bodies of theory and was endlessly
susceptible to being seduced by powerful or fashionable ideologies.
During the 1930s his love of Freud, surrealism and Wallon did not stop
him, after being drawn to the seminars of the modernist mystic Alexandre
Kojève, from engaging in a passionate affair with Hegel. Sitting
alongside such intellectual luminaries as Raymond Queneau, Georges
Bataille, Merleau-Ponty, Alexandre Koryé and André Breton, Lacan drank
in the words of the Russian émigré whose speech had become \'the very
language of modernity, the quintessence of the intellectual
vanguard.\'[^[\[18\]]{.underline}^](http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html#_edn18)

 

[For many of those who attended them Kojève\'s seminars were a religious
experience. Bataille once wrote that in these seminars he felt
suffocated, crushed, shattered, nailed to his
place.[\[19\]](http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html#_edn19) From
Kojève [Lacan learnt]{.mark} not only a version of Hegel but also [the
techniques of seduction and intellectual enslavement]{.mark} with which
this charismatic teacher, who defined himself as a \'Stalinist of the
strictest obedience\', enthralled and mesmerised his
students]{.underline}.

 

[Lacan\'s susceptibility to intellectual seduction should not
necessarily be construed as a sign of insincerity. In many respects his
own attitude to knowledge was merely a more acute version of that shown
by Freud and other \'messianic\' intellectuals. The tragic predicament
of such intellectuals is that, [driven by]{.mark} terrifying feelings of
[emotional emptiness and insecurity, they mistakenly conclude that
intellectual truths can be an adequate substitute for emotional
warmth]{.mark}. Convinced that difficult or abstract intellectual
formulations can alone fill the void they feel within them, they develop
a voracious appetite for such formulations, anorexically judging their
goodness by the degree of difficulty or abstraction they possess.
[Believing that what they have devoured is intrinsically nourishing and
failing to grasp the poverty of the diet]{.mark} they have adopted
through their own self-denying ordinances, [they now]{.mark} feel
impelled to [share their \'truths\' with others]{.mark}. Indeed they are
driven by their own generosity to do so. [Like a starving man who
compels others to eat the diet of stones he believes has saved him, they
give abundantly of their poverty out of a genuine conviction that they
are enriching others]{.mark}. Because their own most generous impulses
have become inextricably entwined with their impulse to self-denial
[they are unable]{.mark} to discriminate between generosity and cruelty
and unable [to understand that]{.mark} by compulsively sharing with
others (or compelling others to share) their own chosen form of
intellectual or spiritual wealth [they are merely disseminating their
poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}.

 

Lacan\'s need to feed upon the stones of difficult intellectual truth
was certainly not satisfied by Kojeve\'s seminar or even by his
encounter with the thought of Heidegger. Soon after he had published the
revised, Hegelian version of his mirror theory in 1949, he was inspired
by the appearance of Lévi-Strauss\'s *Les Structures Elémentaires de la
Parenté* to embark upon a study of Saussure and of structuralist
linguistics. Although his early writings had shown no interest in such
an approach, Lacan gradually elevated Saussure into a major prophet.
Just as he had reinvented psychoanalysis in the image of Wallon and
Hegel so he now reconstructed his own Lacanian version of Freud in such
a way as to make it appear either that Saussure was one of the founders
of psychoanalysis or at the very least that he had discovered a key by
which the mysteries of Freudianism could finally be unlocked.

 

Strategically, Lacan\'s decision to forge an alliance between his own
traduced version of Freud and structuralism proved to be one of the most
effective of all his intellectual manoeuvres. On the face of it there
was nothing to suggest that such a move could ever be successfully
completed. Saussure\'s linguistics had no apparent relation to
psychoanalysis. Lévi-Strauss\'s structural anthropology was an even less
likely bed-fellow. Lévi-Strauss indeed had made the incompatibility of
his own approach with that of Freud abundantly clear. The whole temper
of his \'science\' was hostile to the realm of affectivity and
explicitly ruled out human emotions as a proper object of scientific
investigation.[^[\[20\]]{.underline}^](http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html#_edn20) In
his extraordinary efforts to synthesise the unsynthesisable, however,
Lacan showed something of his true intellectual kinship with Freud.
Frank Cioffi characterises Freud\'s style of reasoning in the following
terms:

>  
>
> Examination of Freud\'s interpretations will show that he typically
> proceeds by beginning with whatever content his theoretical
> preconceptions compel him to maintain underlies the symptoms and then,
> by working back and forth between it and the explanandum, constructing
> persuasive but spurious links between
> them.[^[\[21\]]{.underline}^](http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html#_edn21)

 

[Lacan\'s method of dealing with disparate and ostensibly incompatible
theoretical systems is very similar. Starting from the assumption that
there are links between various ideologies and psychoanalysis, he then
elaborates complex chains of reasoning which supposedly reveal these
links while actually constructing them ex nihilo. One of [the great
advantages to Lacan]{.mark} of this approach to theory-building [was
that it]{.mark} almost inevitably [led to the creation of intellectual
coalitions with the result that Lacan was able to attract supporters
from outside]{.mark} the constituency of [psychoanalysis]{.mark}. This
ultimately proved indispensable to Lacan when his own idiosyncratic
approach, and his increasing insistence on shortening analytic sessions
to a matter of minutes (without any proportionate decrease in his fee),
led to his expulsion from the International Psychoanalytic
Association.]{.underline}

[ ]{.underline}

[His eclecticism meant that [he could draw support from both Marxists
and structuralists so that he was]{.mark} eventually [able to start a
psychoanalytical association of his own which survived in spite of the
mother church of psychoanalysis severing all links with it]{.mark}. The
most important of all these coalitions was created [in 1964]{.mark} when
Louis [Althusser]{.mark}, already established as a charismatic Marxist
ideologist, ended a period of immersion in structuralist thought by
producing an article entitled \'Freud and Lacan\' in which he [paid
homage]{.mark} the latter. The article had the effect of [transforming
Lacan\'s intellectual fortunes, converting him]{.mark} almost overnight
[from]{.mark} an eccentric presence on [the margins of French
intellectual life to a central figure]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[ ]{.underline}

[Lacan\'s project was from now on associated with the work of Barthes,
Lévi-Strauss, and Foucault. Now that Lacan\'s texts had received the
imprimatur of French ideological Marxism, they were pored over and
expounded by Althusser\'s students and colleagues at the Ecole Normale
Supérieure - who included such figures as Etienne Balibar, Pierre
Machéry and the young Jacques Alain-Miller who would soon become
Lacan\'s son-in-law and his faithful lieutenant. Meanwhile
[Lacan\'s]{.mark} Paris [seminar gained a sudden]{.mark} access of
[prestige]{.mark} and became, in the words of one sympathetic
commentator, \'a glittering socio-intellectual occasion\' - a kind of
abstruse secular mass which those who saw themselves as intellectual
revolutionaries, and who wished to be initiated into the deepest
mysteries of structuralism, felt compelled to
attend]{.underline}.[^[\[22\]]{.underline}^](http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html#_edn22)

#### **Ontology is contradictory, self-aggrandizing, and devolves into anti-political moralizing -- it ignores institutional engagement which is a better way to engage anti-black racism.**

**Gordon 21** -- Professor of Philosophy and Department Chair at
University of Connecticut, PhD in Philosophy at Yale, founder of the
Center for Afro-Jewish Studies, Honorary Professor in the Unit for the
Humanities at Rhodes University, South Africa; Chairperson of the
American Philosophical Association Committee on Public Philosophy; and
Chairperson of the Awards Committee and Global Collaborations for the
Caribbean Philosophical Association, of which he was the organization's
first president \[Lewis, Freedom, Justice and Decolonization, Chapter 5:
Thoughts on Afropessimism, Copyright Year 2021\]

At this point, the crucial meditation would be on politics and political
action. **[An attitude of [infinite resignation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
to the world **[[without]{.mark} the leap of committed [action
would]{.mark} simply [be]{.mark}]{.underline}** pessimistic or
**[[nihilistic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Similarly, an attitude of hope or
optimism about the future would lack infinite resignation. We see here
the underlying failure of the two approaches. Yet ironically, there is a
form of failure at failing in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic
one, since if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal, then the
"act" of resignation would have been achieved, which, paradoxically,
would be a success; it would be a successful failing of failure. **[For
politics to emerge, there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation to consider.]{.underline}**

The first is that [[politics]{.mark} is a social phenomenon, which means
it [requires]{.mark} the [expanding options of a social
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} It must transcend the self. Turning away
from the social world, though a statement about politics, is not in and
of itself political. As we have seen, the ancients from whom much
Western political theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a
disparaging term for an individual resigned from political
life---namely, idiōtēs, a private person, one not concerned with public
affairs, in English: an idiot. I mention "Western political theory"
because that is the hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism; I
have not come across Afropessimistic writings on thought outside of that
framework. We do not have to end our etymological journey in ancient
Greek. Recall that extending our linguistic archaeology back a few
thousand years we could examine the Middle Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE)
of Kmt's Mdw Ntr word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and other Greek-speaking peoples, was that a lack of
hearing entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. [The
contemporary inward [resignation of seeking]{.mark} a form of
[purity]{.mark} from]{.underline} the loathsome historical reality of
[racial oppression]{.underline}, in this reading,
[[retreats]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[into]{.mark} a form of
[moralism]{.mark}]{.underline} (private, normative satisfaction) instead
of public responsibility born of and borne by action. The nonbeing to
which Afropessimists refer is also a form of inaudibility.

[The second is]{.underline} the importance of [power.]{.underline}
Politics makes no sense without it. As we have seen throughout our
earlier reflections on power, Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin
word potis as its source, from which came the word "potent" as in an
omnipotent god. If we again look back farther, we will notice the Middle
Kingdom Mdw Ntr word pHty, which refers to godlike strength. Yet for
those ancient Northeast Africans, even the gods' abilities came from a
source. In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka activates the ka (sometimes,
as we have seen, translated as soul, spirit, womb, or "magic"), which
makes reality.20 All this amounts to a straightforward thesis on power
as the ability with the means to make things happen.

There is an alchemical quality of power. [The human world, premised on
symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning into being, and
those new [meanings afford relationships that build institutions
through]{.mark} a world of [culture]{.mark}]{.underline}, a phenomenon
that Freud, we should recall, rightly described as "a prosthetic god."
It is godlike because it addresses what humanity historically sought
from the gods---protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and
social forms of misery. Such power clearly can be abused. It is where
those enabling capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the
hording of social resources into propping up some people as gods that
the legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions
decline and stimulate pessimism and nihilism. The institutions in Abya
Yala and in Northern countries, such as the United States and Canada,
very rarely attempt to establish positive relations to blacks, and
Blacks the subtext of Afropessimism and this entire meditation.

[The discussion points to a demand for political commitment. Politics is
manifested under different names throughout the history of our
species]{.underline}, but the one occasioning the word "politics" is, as
we have seen, from the Greek pólis, which refers to ancient Hellenic
city-states. It identifies specific kinds of activities conducted inside
the city-state, where order necessitated the resolution of conflicts
through rules of discourse the violation of which could lead to (civil)
war, a breaking down of relations into those appropriate for
"outsiders." Returning to the Fanonian observation of selves and others,
it is clear that imposed limitations on certain groups amount to
impeding or blocking the option and activities of politics. Yet, as a
problem occurring within the polity, the problem short of war becomes a
political one.

Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this.
**[If the problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political---where
antiblack institutions of power have]{.underline}**, as their project,
**[the impeding of Black power, which in effect requires barring Black
access to political institutions---then antiblack societies are
ultimately threats also to politics defined as the human negotiation of
the expansion of human capabilities]{.underline}** or, more to the
point, appearance, speech, and freedom.

**[Antipolitics is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack
racism is hegemonic are also those in which racial moralizing dominates;
[moralizing stops]{.mark} at individuals [at the expense of addressing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** the transformation of which would
make immoral individuals irrelevant. **[As a [political problem]{.mark},
it [demands a political solution]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is not
accidental that blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of
unrealized freedom and against whom violence is waged against appearance
and speech. As so many from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela Y. Davis,
Michelle Alexander, Angela J. Davis, Noël Cazenave have shown **[the
expansion of]{.underline}** privatization and **[[incarceration
is]{.mark} squarely placed in [a structure of states and civil societies
premised on]{.mark} the [limitations of freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Blacks)---ironically, as seen in countries such as South Africa and the
United States, in the name of freedom. 21

That power is a facilitating or enabling phenomenon, a functional
element of the human world, **[[a]{.mark} viable [response must
be]{.mark} the establishment of [relations that reach beyond]{.mark} the
singularity of [the body]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I bring this up because
proponents of [Afropessimism might object]{.underline} to this analysis
[because of its appeal to a human world.]{.underline} If that world is
abrogated, the site of struggle becomes that which is patently not
human. [It is not accidental that popular race discourse
refers]{.underline} today [to "black bodies" instead of "black
people,"]{.underline} for instance. As the human world is discursive,
social, and relational, [this abandonment amounts to an appeal to the
nonrelational]{.underline}, the incommunicability of radicalized
singularity, [and appeals to the body and its very limited
reach,]{.underline} if not isolation. At that point, it is perhaps the
psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst who would be helpful, as
**[[turning radically inward offers]{.mark} the promise of
[despair]{.mark}]{.underline}**, narcissistic delusions of divine power,
and, as Fanon also observed, madness.22 **[[Even if that]{.mark}
slippery slope [were rejected, the performative contradiction]{.mark} of
attempting [to communicate such singularity]{.mark} or absence thereof
[requires]{.mark},]{.underline}** at least for consistency, **[the
appropriate course of action: [silence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[The remaining question]{.mark} for Afropessimism]{.underline}**,
especially those who are primarily academics, **[[becomes]{.mark} this:
[Why write?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[It is a question for which]{.underline}**, in both existential and
political terms, **[I do not see how an answer could be given from an
Afropessimistic perspective]{.underline}** without the unfortunate
revelation of cynicism. **[The [marketability of Afropessimists
in]{.mark} predominantly [white
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**---perhaps as an exotic phenomenon
that affirms white standpoints as ontological sites of
legitimacy---**[[is]{.mark} no doubt [in]{.mark} the immediate and
[paradoxical satisfaction in dissatisfaction]{.mark} it
offers.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[[if Afropessimists were correct,
their]{.mark} only [solace would be in black institutions]{.mark}, [but
that]{.mark}, too, [would pose a problem since]{.mark} the argument is
that [such institutions lack agency]{.mark}]{.underline}** because, as
black, they are absent. This is not to say that critical black and Black
thinkers should not do their work in predominantly white spaces. It is
simply that **[the argument of the impossibility of their doing so makes
their location in such places patently contradictory.]{.underline}** We
are at this point on familiar terrain. **[As with ancient logical
paradoxes d]{.underline}**enying the viability of time and motion**[,
the best option]{.underline}**, after a moment of immobilized
reflection, **[is,]{.underline}** eventually, **[to move
on]{.underline}**, even where the pause is itself significant as an
encomium of thought.

#### Social death theory is wrong\-\--conflates the oppressors' view with the truth of black of existence, which re-centers the slave owner's perspective and prevents struggles for re-humanization

George **Lipsitz 17**. Professor of Black Studies and Sociology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. 2017. "What is this Black in
the Black Radical Tradition?" in Futures of Black Radicalism, ed. by
Johnson and Lubin, 2017. p. 108-110.

Three miracles seem to characterize the history of Black people in the
United States. The very survival of Black people in the face of
murderous brutality and genocidal intent qualifies as a miracle. [The
enduring reality of Black humanity in a society that has used every
means at its disposal to]{.underline} destroy Black dignity and [deny
Black people]{.underline} the opportunity to exercise [their full
humanity appears miraculous. The historical record of democratic
aspiration and achievement by Black people, of creating]{.underline}
democratic [opportunities for themselves and extending them to others,
seems to defy normal rational explanations.
[Despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[social death]{.mark} at the center
of the slave system and]{.underline} the [organized abandonments
of]{.underline} today\'s [neoliberal capitalism, despite beatings,
lynchings, shootings, mass incarceration and systematic impoverishment,
[Black people]{.mark} have [survived]{.mark}]{.underline} and thrived.
[In slavery, African people]{.underline} in the Americas
[owned]{.underline} virtually [nothing, not even the skin on their
backs. They had every reason to give in to despair. Yet
they]{.underline} somehow [managed to survive, [to extend
recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} and respect [to each other while in
bondage, [and]{.mark} to [maintain a commitment to the **linked fate**
of all humans]{.mark}. Time and time again, Black people have
[**countered** vicious dehumanization with]{.mark} determined and
[**successful re-humanization**. Insisting on **their own humanity**
and]{.mark} the humanity [of **all people**]{.mark}, even that of their
oppressors, they have been at the forefront of]{.underline} what Dr.
King called ["the bitter but beautiful struggle" for a more just and
better world. [From]{.mark} the egalitarian politics of [abolition
democracy]{.mark} in the wake of the Civil War and the participatory
democracy of the [civil rights]{.mark} movement to the contemporary
insurgencies waged under]{.underline} the banners of
[\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter [and]{.mark}
\#[SayHerName]{.mark}, struggles for]{.underline} Black survival and
[[Black humanity]{.mark} have]{.underline} repeatedly [[linked the
termination of]{.mark} existing [racist policies to the creation of new
democratic **practices and institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Forced
to cope with the nadir of political evil over centuries, Black people
have responded consistently by forging advanced concepts of a deeply
politicized love. Perhaps precisely because brutality and oppression can
make people decidedly unlovable, [African people in America have been
adept at finding ways to perceive something left to love inside
themselves and in others. [That]{.mark} ability has
[enabled]{.mark}]{.underline} their survival, [the [preservation of
their humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}, and their emergence as the
nation\'s foremost champions of democracy and social justice. The people
who were systematically denied access to the fruits and benefits of
democratic citizenship and social membership turned out to be the people
who valued democracy the most and who did the most to extend it to
others. \[END PAGE 108\] Cedric Robinson has demonstrated that the three
miracles were not really miracles at all, but rather products of a
collective intelligence developed over generations of struggle. In Black
Marxism, Robinson defines the Black Radical Tradition as "the continuing
development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical
struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation
to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality."1 Thus in
many ways, the greatest achievement of the Black community was itself,
its emergence as an aggrieved and insurgent polity committed to social
justice. [The "Black" in the Black Radical Tradition is a politics
rather than a pigment, a culture rather than a color]{.underline}. Yet
[this Blackness **does not presume** a unified homogenous community with
only one set of interests, needs, and desires]{.underline}. On the
contrary, Robinson\'s research reveals that [the key building blocks for
Black survival, Black humanity, and Black democracy came from the lower
rungs of Black society, from the plantations and slave quarters, out of
the contradictions of the rural regimes of slavery and debt peonage and
the living conditions in ghettos of northern and western cities.
Experience taught the Black poor and the Black working class that racial
capitalism entailed "an unacceptable standard of human
conduct"]{.underline}2 [that they needed to counter with a politics that
was]{.underline} "inventive rather than imitative, [communitarian rather
than individualistic, democratic rather than republican]{.underline},
Afro-Christian rather than secular and materialist."3 [Robinson\'s
[emphasis on political struggle]{.mark} as the main explanation for
Black]{.underline} survival, [humanity]{.underline}, and democracy
[[reminds us **not to confuse** the]{.mark} grandiose [**aspirations and
illusions** of the powerful with]{.mark} the **[actual lived
experiences]{.mark}** of those they control. [Slavery did
mandate]{.mark} legally and militarily supported [social death, but
slaves worked]{.mark} assiduously and effectively each day, every day,
each year, and every year [to create]{.mark} a **[rich social
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 As Robinson argues, ["Slavery gave the lie
to its own conceit: one could not create a perfect system of oppression
and exploitation."]{.underline}5 [[Domination produces resistance,
and]{.mark} resistance [plants the]{.mark} seeds of a [new]{.mark}
society **[within]{.mark} the shell** of [the old]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As Robinson explains in Black Movements in America, \"The resistances to
slavery were the \[END PAGE 109\] principal grounds for the radically
alternative political culture that coalesced in the Black communities of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the era of revolutionary,
liberal and nationalist impulses among Europeans in North America." 6
[[Declaring Blacks to be less than human **could not make them
so**]{.mark}, even in the eyes of their oppressors.
Research]{.underline} by John Blassingame, George Rawick, Sterling
Stuckey, Herbert Gutman, and Stephanie Camp (among others) [reveals how
[slaves fused African]{.mark} retention [and New World]{.mark} invention
[to forge a culture that **affirmed their humanity**]{.mark} and the
humanity of others]{.underline}.7 [They [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}
this [[common humanity through]{.mark} multicultural, [multiracial
alliances with poor whites and]{.mark} others in [maroon
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. 8 [In colonial Louisiana, Blacks
[reached out to Native Americans]{.mark} for help in [resisting
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 [Slave owners]{.underline}, however,
[were less successful in preserving their own humanity]{.underline}. In
order [to maintain the illusion of complete control, they tortured,
whipped, hanged, burned, and dismembered their \"property\" when it
displayed signs of having human will]{.underline}.10 [Black people
witnessed white people\'s inhumanity and pitied them. As early as the
1820s]{.underline}, David [Walker argued that while whites lost the
moral capacity to perceive the evil they enacted, they nonetheless knew
\"in their hearts\" that Blacks were human]{.underline}. He argued that
it was precisely this recognition that propelled their cruelty and
brutality: they presumed that Blacks resented them and, if given the
opportunity, would do to whites what whites had done to Blacks.11 [In
his history of the New Orleans slave market]{.underline}, Walter
[Johnson notes a similar loss of humanity among slave owners.
Whites]{.underline} invested more than money in the slave system; they
[looked to]{.underline} it to [elevate]{.underline} them [beyond the
status of ordinary mortals and became outraged when their chattel
refused to conform to the roles they had been assigned]{.underline}.
Johnson notes: The greater the transformative hopes slaveholders took
with them to the slave market, the more violent their reactions to the
inevitable disappointment of their efforts to get real slaves to act
like imagined ones \... If they had to, they would use brutality to
close the distance between the roles they imagined for themselves and
the failings of the slaves they bought as props for their performance.

The city of Baltimore was rocked by protests and riots over the death of
Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American man who died in police
custody. Tragically, Gray's death was only one of a recent in a series
of racially-charged, often violent, incidents. On April 4th, Walter
Scott was fatally shot by a police officer after fleeing from a routine
traffic stop. On March 8th, Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members were
caught on camera gleefully chanting, "There Will Never Be A N\*\*\*\*\*
In SAE." [On March 1st, a homeless Black man was shot in broad daylight
by a Los Angeles police officer. And these are not isolated incidents,
of course. Institutional and systemic racism reinforce discrimination in
countless situations, including hiring, sentencing, housing, and even
mortgage lending. [It would be easy to see]{.mark} in all this powerful
[evidence that racism]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [permanent]{.mark} fixture
in America's social fabric [and]{.mark} even, perhaps, an
[inevitable]{.mark} aspect of human nature. Indeed, the mere act of
labeling others according to their age, gender, or race is a reflexive
habit of the human mind. Social categories, like race, impact our
thinking quickly, often outside of our awareness]{.underline}. Extensive
research has found that these implicit racial biases---negative thoughts
and feelings about people from other races---are automatic, pervasive,
and difficult to suppress. Neuroscientists have also explored racial
prejudice by exposing people to images of faces while scanning their
brains in fMRI machines. Early studies found that when people viewed
faces of another race, the amount of activity in the amygdala---a small
brain structure associated with experiencing emotions, including
fear---was associated with individual differences on implicit measures
of racial bias. This work has led many to conclude that racial biases
might be part of a primitive---and possibly hard-wired---neural fear
response to racial out-groups. There is little question that categories
such as race, gender, and age play a major role in shaping the biases
and stereotypes that people bring to bear in their judgments of others.
[However, research has shown that [how people categorize themselves
may]{.mark} [be]{.mark} just as [fundamental to]{.mark} understanding
[prejudice]{.mark} as how they categorize others. When people categorize
themselves as part of a group, their self-concept shifts from the
individual ("I") to the collective level ("us"). People form groups
rapidly and favor members of their own group even when groups are formed
on arbitrary grounds, such as the simple flip of a coin. These findings
highlight the remarkable ease with which humans form coalitions. Recent
research confirms that [coalition]{.mark}-based [preferences trump
race]{.mark}-based preferences. For example, [both Democrats and
Republicans]{.mark} [favor]{.mark} the resumes of those affiliated with
[their]{.mark} political [party]{.mark} much [more than]{.mark} they
favor those who share [their race]{.mark}. These coalition-based
preferences remain powerful even in the absence of the animosity present
in electoral politics. Our research has shown that the simple act of
[placing people on a mixed-race team can diminish]{.mark} their
[automatic]{.mark} racial [bias.]{.mark} In a series of experiments,
White participants who were randomly placed on a mixed-race team---the
Tigers or Lions---showed little evidence of implicit racial
bias]{.underline}. [Merely [belonging to a mixed-race team trigged
positive automatic associations]{.mark} with all of the members of their
own group, irrespective of race[.]{.mark} Being a part of one of these
seemingly trivial mixed-race groups produced similar effects on brain
activity---[the amygdala responded to team]{.mark} membership [rather
than race]{.mark}. Taken together, these studies indicate that momentary
changes in group membership can override the influence of race on the
way we see, think about, and feel toward people who are different from
ourselves]{.underline}. Although these coalition-based distinctions
might be the most basic building block of bias, they say little about
the other factors that cause group conflict. Why do some groups get
ignored while others get attacked? Whenever we encounter a new person or
group we are motivated to answer two questions as quickly as possible:
"is this person a friend or foe?" and "are they capable of enacting
their intentions toward me?" In other words, once we have determined
that someone is a member of an out-group, we need to determine what
kind? The nature of the relations between groups---are we cooperative,
competitive, or neither?---and their relative status---do you have
access to resources?---largely determine the course of intergroup
interactions. Groups that are seen as competitive with one's interests,
and capable of enacting their nasty intentions, are much more likely to
be targets of hostility than more benevolent (e.g., elderly) or
powerless (e.g., homeless) groups. This is one reason why sports
rivalries have such psychological potency. For instance, fans of the
Boston Red Sox are more likely to feel pleasure, and exhibit
reward-related neural responses, at the misfortunes of the archrival New
York Yankees than other baseball teams (and vice versa)---especially in
the midst of a tight playoff race. (How much fans take pleasure in the
misfortunes of their rivals is also linked to how likely they would be
to harm fans from the other team.) Just as a particular person's group
membership can be flexible, so too are the relations between groups.
Groups that have previously had cordial relations may become rivals (and
vice versa). [Indeed, psychological and biological [responses to
out-group members can change]{.mark}, depending on whether or not that
out-group is perceived as threatening. For example, people exhibit
greater pleasure---they smile---in response to the misfortunes of
stereotypically competitive groups (e.g., investment bankers); however,
this malicious pleasure is reduced when you provide participants with
counter-stereotypic information (e.g., "investment bankers are working
with small companies to help them weather the economic
downturn).]{.underline} Competition between "us" and "them" can even
distort our judgments of distance, making threatening out-groups seem
much closer than they really are. These distorted perceptions can serve
to amplify intergroup discrimination: the more different and distant
"they" are, the easier it is to disrespect and harm them. [Thus, not all
out-groups are treated the same: some elicit indifference whereas others
become targets of antipathy. Stereotypically threatening groups are
especially likely to be targeted with violence, but those [stereotypes
can be tempered with other info]{.mark}rmation. [If]{.mark} perceptions
of intergroup relations can be changed, [individuals]{.mark} may
[overcome hostility]{.mark} toward perceived foes [and become more
responsive]{.mark} to one another's grievances. [The flexible
nature]{.mark} of both group membership and intergroup relations [offers
reason to be]{.mark} cautiously [optimistic about]{.mark} the potential
for greater [coop]{.mark}eration [among groups in conflict]{.mark} (be
they black versus white or citizens versus police). [One strategy is to
bring]{.mark} multiple [groups together around a common
goal]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, during the fiercely contested
2008 Democratic presidential primary process, Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama supporters gave more money to strangers who supported the same
primary candidate (compared to the rival candidate). Two months later,
after the Democratic National Convention, the supporters of both
candidates coalesced around the party nominee---Barack Obama---and this
bias disappeared. [In fact, merely [creating]{.mark} a sense of
[cohesion]{.mark} between two competitive groups [can increase
empathy]{.mark} for the suffering of our rivals. [These]{.mark} sorts of
strategies can help [reduce aggression toward]{.mark} hostile
[out-groups,]{.mark} [which is critical for]{.mark} creating more
opportunities for [constructive dialogue addressing]{.mark} greater
social [injustices.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, instilling a sense
of common identity and cooperation is extremely difficult in entrenched
intergroup conflicts, but when it happens, the benefits are obvious.
Consider how the community leaders in New York City and Ferguson
responded differently to protests against police brutality---in NYC
political leaders expressed grief and concern over police brutality and
moved quickly to make policy changes in policing, whereas the leaders
and police in Ferguson responded with high-tech military vehicles and
riot gear. In the first case, multiple groups came together with a
common goal---to increase the safety of everyone in the community; in
the latter case, the actions of the police likely reinforced the "us"
and "them" distinctions. Tragically, these types of conflicts continue
to roil the country. Understanding the psychology and neuroscience of
social identity and intergroup relations cannot undo the effects of
systemic racism and discriminatory practices; however, it can offer
insights into the psychological processes responsible for escalating the
tension between, for example, civilians and police officers. Even in
cases where it isn't possible to create a common identity among groups
in conflict, it may be possible to blur the boundaries between groups.
In one recent experiment, we sorted participants into groups---red
versus blue team---competing for a cash prize. Half of the participants
were randomly assigned to see a picture of a segregated social network
of all the players, in which red dots clustered together, blue dots
clustered together, and the two clusters were separated by white space.
The other half of the participants saw an integrated social network in
which the red and blue dots were mixed together in one large cluster.
Participants who thought the two teams were interconnected with one
another reported greater empathy for the out-group players compared to
those who had seen the segregated network. Thus, reminding people that
individuals could be connected to one another despite being from
different groups may be another way to build trust and understanding
among them. A mere month before Freddie Gray died in police custody,
President Obama addressed the nation on the 50th anniversary of Bloody
Sunday in Selma: "We do a disservice to the cause of justice by
intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial
division is inherent to America. To deny...progress -- our progress --
would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we
can to make America better.\" The president was saying that we, as a
society, have a responsibility to reduce prejudice and discrimination.
These recent findings from psychology and neuroscience indicate that we,
as individuals, possess this capacity. Of course this capacity is not
sufficient to usher in racial equality or peace. Even when the level of
prejudice against particular out-groups decreases, it does not imply
that the level of institutional discrimination against these or other
groups will necessarily improve. [Ultimately, [only collective action
and institutional evolution can address systemic racism]{.mark}. [The
science is clear]{.mark} on one thing, though: [individual bias and
discrimination are changeable]{.mark}. [Race-based prejudice]{.mark} and
discrimination, in particular, [are created and reinforced by]{.mark}
many [social factors,]{.mark} but they are [not inevitable consequences
of]{.mark} our [biology]{.mark}. Perhaps understanding how coalitional
thinking impacts intergroup relations will make it easier for us to
affect real social change going forward.]{.underline}

DT. [It seems to me that a frequent critique of psychoanalysis and
politics is that in its inability]{.underline}, and perhaps
unwillingness [to propose concrete policy reforms]{.underline} or
political projects, **[it falls back on a notion that everyone should
just undergo analysis]{.underline}**. Do you think that a political
project that is informed by psychoanalytic teachings implies that we
should all undergo analysis? You write in your book for instance that
fantasy is a crucial point for facilitating a sort of un-bonding process
from the larger capitalist mode of subjectivity. [What do you see as the
role of analysis and political emancipatory work]{.underline}? [**TM. I
will alienate many of my analyst friends with this response**, but [I
have no political]{.mark} [investment]{.mark} at all [in psychoanalytic
practice]{.mark}]{.underline}. I've undergone some analysis myself.
However, **[[I don't believe that]{.mark} everyone [undergoing
psychoanalysis would change much]{.mark} at all
politically]{.underline}**. [What is important about psychoanalysis to
me is its theoretical intervention, its discovery of the death drive and
the role that fantasy plays in our psyche]{.underline}. This is the
great advance. [**[And political struggle can integrate these
theoretical insights without any help from actual
psychoanalysis]{.mark}**. What allows one to disinvest in the capitalist
mode of subjectivity is not]{.underline}, in my view, [the
psychoanalytic session. Instead it is the confrontation with a mode of
enjoyment]{.underline} that ceases to provide the satisfaction that it
promises. [This prompts one to think about alternatives]{.underline}.
Obviously, not everyone can become a theorist, but in a sense,
[**[everyone already is a theorist]{.mark}**. We theorize our enjoyment
when we think through our day and plan out where we're going to do. Even
watching a television show requires an elaborate theoretical exercise.
Making this theorizing evident]{.underline} and thus arousing an
interest in theory [is to me much more important than having a lot of
people undergo psychoanalysis]{.underline}. In response to your question
about the universalization of psychoanalytic practice, I have more faith
in a universalization of psychoanalytic theory.

[WE SHOULD congratulate the Science Museum for setting up an exhibition
on psychoanalysis. Exposure to pseudoscience]{.underline} greatly h[elps
understand genuine science, just as learning about tyranny helps in
understanding democracy.]{.underline} [Over the past 30 years,
**[psycho]{.mark}analysis [has]{.mark}** quietly **[been
displaced]{.mark}** in academia [by]{.mark} scientific [psychology. But
it persists in popular culture]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as being a
lucrative profession. [It is the psychology of those who have not
bothered to learn psychology]{.underline}, and the psychotherapy of
choice for those who believe in the power of immaterial mind over body.
[**Psychoanalysis is a bogus science** because **[its practitioners do
not do scientific research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When the field turned
100, a group of [[psychoanalysts admitted this gap]{.mark} and
endeavoured to fill it. They [claimed to have performed the first
experiment]{.mark}]{.underline} showing that patients benefited from
their treatment. Regrettably, **[[they did not include a control group
and did not entertain]{.mark} the possibility of [placebo
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Hence, [their claim remains
untested]{.mark}]{.underline} (The International Journal of
Psychoanalysis, vol 81, p 513). More recently, a meta-analysis published
in American Psychologist (vol 65, p 98) purported to support the claim
that a form of psychoanalysis called psychodynamic therapy is effective.
However, once again, the original studies did not involve control
groups. [In [110 years, psychoanalysts have not set up a single
lab]{.mark}. They do not participate in scientific
congresses,]{.underline} do not submit their papers to scientific
journals and are foreign to the scientific community - [[a marginality
typical of pseudoscience]{.underline}]{.mark}. This does not mean
[[their hypotheses]{.underline}]{.mark} have never been put to the test.
True, they [are [so vague that they are hard to test and]{.mark} some of
them]{.underline} [are]{.underline}, by Freud\'s own admission,
[irrefutable]{.underline}. Still, [most of [the testable ones have been
soundly refuted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, most dreams have no
sexual content. The Oedipus complex is a myth]{.underline}; boys do not
hate their fathers because they would like to have sex with their
mothers. [The list goes on.]{.underline} As for therapeutic efficacy,
little is known because psychoanalysts do not perform double-blind
clinical trials or follow-up studies. Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience.
Its concepts are woolly and untestable yet are regarded as unassailable
axioms. As a result of such dogmatism, [[psychoanalysis]{.mark} has
[remained]{.mark} basically [stagnant]{.mark} for more than a century,
[in contrast with scientific psychology, which is
thriving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Psychoanalysis has zero [logical]{.underline} or [empirical]{.underline} basis, can't be scaled up, and totalizes the existence of the human condition in pseudoscientific terms

Contemporary Political Theory. Avenel: Aug 2008. Vol. 7, Iss. 3; pg.
351, 7 pgs\]

The strengths and weaknesses of the text largely follow from the
usefulness and limits of the perspective it provides. [The
[Lacan]{.mark}ian perspective]{.underline}, as a partial truth,
[certainly provides interesting insights and a different way of
seeing]{.underline}, and [as such often generates productive
contributions]{.underline}. However, [it fails drastically
to]{.underline} [understand the **partiality of its own
\'truth\'**]{.underline}. In Stavrakakis\'s words, lack can\'t be
signified but it can be formalized (p. 279). In other words, a final map
of the structure of reality can still, from this perspective, be drawn
\-- and has been drawn already by Lacan. In effect, the [result is a
claim to be the theoretical end of]{.underline} [history \-- all else is
utopian, essentialist and so on.]{.underline} In many respects, [the
perspective is also reactive]{.underline}, [defined by what it is
against]{.underline} (anti-essentialist, anti-utopian,
anti-fantasmatic). **[It [is]{.mark} less clear what it is
for]{.underline}** \-- although the idea of feminine jouissance begins
the task of constructing a positive pole. [Its relation to the other is
**very [intolerant]{.mark}** and dismissive. [It]{.mark} is not open to
other voices because it is always ready to judge the other as failing
its own rigid internal criteria. It [expresses a dangerous urge to drive
the other out of]{.mark} the community]{.underline} of speakers, [and
perhaps out of [existence]{.mark}]{.underline} altogether. The chapter
on Castoriadis is symptomatic here. Castoriadis in many ways stands for
the entire field of horizontalist radicalism \-- horizontalists and
immanentists (Stirner, Reich, Negri, Deleuze, Marcuse, various critics
of Lacan) circle around the text like barbarians at the gates. The
dispute between Lacanianism and horizontalism is a dispute the stakes of
which Lacanians are reluctant to confront, instead hiding behind the
view from one side \-- \'they disagree with us, therefore they are
wrong\'. Except that \'wrong\' is usually replaced by one of a number of
theoretical epithets \-- romantic, utopian, essentialist \-- which sound
superficially like useful categories of theory but which are never
defined and which serve mainly as a name to call people who disagree
with one or another basic Lacanian assumption. The impression is given
that those who hold these perspectives are somehow naïve, intellectually
disreputable or unrespectable, but this connoted claim is never
demonstrated. It is simply a choice of one perspective over another,
conveyed in loaded language. Like most of its ilk, [this book does
plenty to show what Lacanian theory does]{.underline}, how it \'works\'
as a theoretical machine or toolkit, [but rather less to say why
it]{.underline} [should be preferred to other approaches]{.underline}
(assuming, of course, that not wanting to be called names is
insufficient reason to accept its validity). [[Lacan]{.mark}ian
theory]{.underline} [[suffers from]{.mark} an **ontological and
epistemological [restrictiveness ]{.mark}**derived from its absolutizing
of structural topologies, [which **limits its**]{.mark} **explanatory
[power]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[rendering far too
many specificities of metropolitan statist societies \'necessary\' or
\'unavoidable\']{.underline}[. [The theory involves]{.underline}]{.mark}
[restrictive, totalizing [claims that are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**neither logically**]{.mark} necessary **[nor empirically
demonstrated]{.mark}**; most often, acceptance of such claims is
unnecessary to gain the benefits of the explanatorily or]{.underline}
[theoretically useful aspects of the perspective. Social phenomena vary
in how well they fit this limiting frame. Nationalism and racism, having
the right form, fit well, and hence become favourite expository targets
for Lacanian theorists. But [dogmas will have to be sacrificed if a
broader]{.mark} field of [social]{.mark} [movement]{.mark}s [is to be
encompassed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1ar psychoanalysis wrong

#### Studies don't support death drive---replicable tests are impossible, variables are too vague to operationalize 

**Holowchak 12** \[Andrew, teaches Philosophy at Rider University. When
Freud (Almost) Met Chaplin: The Science behind Freud\'s \"Especially
Simple, Transparent Case\" Project Muse\]

[The problem is]{.underline} that [psychoanalytic concepts]{.underline}
(e.g., \"super-ego,\" \"Oedipus complex,\" [and \"[death
drive]{.mark}\"]{.underline}30 ), unlike them of say physics
(\"electron,\" \[End Page 67\] \"muon,\" and \"quark\"), [[are logical
constructs that have not been corroborated by]{.underline} **[precise
observations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[replicable
tests]{.underline}**. Hence Freud\'s logical constructs as
proto-concepts are not even adequate as working hypotheses. As early as
1934, J. F. Brown, who claimed he was in sympathy with Freud\'s new
science, urged, \"But, and here almost [all critics of psychoanalysis
are in agreement, the theory has never been precise enough to allow
formulation of working hypotheses for which adequate experimental
situations **could be found\"**]{.underline} (1933, p. 333). He went on
to acknowledge, perhaps somewhat prophetically, given the amount of
attention Freud gets today in philosophy of mind, \"Freud\'s discoveries
probably are the most striking and original contributions made to the
science of mind in our time.\" He added, in a manner that vitiates the
compliment, that Freud is more prophet than scientist---more Bruno than
Galileo (1933, p. 226).

Freud was aware of that. His own view of the concepts of psychoanalysis
is ambivalent. At times, he shows impatience and becomes intolerant of
his critics. \"Only in psychology \[is obscurity not tolerated\]; here
the constitutional incapacity of men for scientific research comes into
full view. It looks as though people did not expect from psychology
progress in knowledge, but some other kind of satisfaction; every
unsolved problem, every acknowledged uncertainty is turned into a ground
of complaint against it\" (1916--7, S.E., XXII: 6). At other times,
[Freud seems to agree with his critics.]{.underline} In
\"Autobiographical Study,\" when he mentions difficulties with
\"compulsion to repeat,\" [he adds]{.underline}:

[Although it arose from a [desire]{.mark} to fix some of the most
important theoretical ideas of psycho-analysis, it [goes far **beyond
psychoanalysis**]{.mark}. I have repeatedly heard it said contemptuously
that [it is impossible to take a science seriously **whose most general
concepts are as lacking in precision as those of libido and of
drive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in psychoanalysis.

(1925, S.E., XX: 57)

In \"Why War?,\" Freud writes to Einstein in a manner to explain his
ambivalence: \"It may perhaps seem to you \[Einstein\] as though our
theories are a kind of mythology and, in the present case, not even an
agreeable one. But does not every science come in the end to a kind of
mythology like this?\" (1933, S.E., XXII: 211)

In sum, [the [bedrock concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis are
conceptually indeterminate]{.mark}]{.underline}. That means that the
fundamental principles of Freudian psychoanalysis are conceptually
indeterminate and, [[thus]{.underline}, **[obscure or
meaningless]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Unfortunately, as we have seen,
Freud was evasive when it \[End Page 68\] came to the question of the
status of the bedrock concepts of psychoanalysis and even said that
psychoanalysis, with the exception of \"repression\" and
\"unconscious,\" could do just as well without them31 (1914, S.E., XIV:
16; 1925, S.E., XX: 32--3). [Without referents to the concepts he
employs so significantly, **[Freud is writing
gobbledygook]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[A related difficulty is conceptual change. [Freud]{.mark}, as a
scientist, [was committed to conceptual flexibility, insofar as his
postulates were avowedly data-driven]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
[many of the conceptual changes he made]{.underline}---e.g., his
rejection of his Seduction theory and [[his adoption of the death drive
and structural model]{.underline}---[were prompted more by theoretical
difficulties than they were driven by observational
data.]{.underline}]{.mark} In addition, [[Freud **surrounded himself**
with **lackeys**]{.mark}, albeit intelligent lackeys, that allowed him,
[**as founder** of psychoanalysis, the **privilege** of being final
arbiter on issues of **conceptual change** within
psychoanalysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}[32]{.mark}

#### Attempting to [use it]{.underline} to create solutions [fails]{.underline}

**Rosen-Carole 10** \[Adam, Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Bard
College, 2010, "Menu Cards in Time of Famine: On Psychoanalysis and
Politics," Psychoanalytic Quarterly, Vol. LXXIX, No. 1, p. 205-207

On the other hand, though in these ways and many others, [psychoanalysis
seems to promote the sorts of subjective dispositions and habits
requisite for a thriving democracy, and though in a variety of ways
psychoanalysis contributes to personal emancipation]{.underline}--- say,
[by releasing individuals from self-defeating, damaging, or petrified
forms action and reaction, object attachment, and the
like]{.underline}---[in light of the very uniqueness of what it has to
offer, one cannot but wonder: [to what extent]{.mark}, if at all,
[can]{.mark} the habits and dispositions---broadly, the forms of
life---cultivated by [psychoanalytic practice]{.mark} survive, let alone
[flourish, under]{.mark} **modern social and [political
conditions]{.mark}**[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[If the]{.mark}
emancipatory [inclinations]{.mark}]{.underline} and democratic virtues
that [psychoanalytic practice promotes [are]{.mark} systematically
[crushed]{.mark}]{.underline} or at least regularly unsupported by the
world in which they would be realized, [**then [isn't
psychoanalysis]{.mark} implicitly** [making promises it cannot
redeem?]{.mark}]{.underline} Might not massive social and political
transformations be the condition for the efficacious practice of
psychoanalysis? And so, under current conditions, [can we avoid
experiencing the forms of life nascently cultivated by psychoanalytic
practice as something of a tease, or even a source of deep
frustration]{.underline}? (2) Concerning psychoanalysis as a politically
inclined theoretical enterprise, [[the worry is whether
political]{.mark} diagnoses and [proposals]{.mark} that proceed
[on]{.mark} the basis of [psychoanalytic insights]{.mark} and forms of
attention [partake of a fantasy of]{.mark} interpretive [efficacy (**all
the world's a couch**]{.mark}]{.underline}, you might say), [wherein our
profound alienation from the conditions for robust political agency are
registered and repudiated]{.underline}? Consider, for example, Freud and
Bullitt's (1967) assessment of the psychosexual determinants of Woodrow
Wilson's political aspirations and impediments, or Reich's (1972)
suggestion that Marxism should appeal to psychoanalysis in order to
illuminate and redress neurotic phenomena that generate disturbances in
working capacity, especially as this concerns religion and bourgeois
sexual ideology. Also relevant are Freud's,
[[Žižek's]{.underline}]{.mark} (1993, 2004), Derrida's (2002) and
others' insistence that we draw the juridical and political consequences
of the [hypothesis of an irreducible [death drive]{.mark}]{.underline},
as well as Marcuse's (1970) proposal that we attend to the weakening of
Eros and the growth of aggression that [[results]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
the coercive [enforcement of the reality principle]{.mark} upon the
sociopolitically weakened ego, and especially to the channeling of this
aggression into hatred of enemies.]{.underline} Reich (1972) and Fromm
(1932) suggest that psychoanalysis be employed to explore the
motivations to political irrationality, especially that singular
irrationality of joining the national-socialist movement, while Irigaray
(1985) diagnoses the desire for the Same, the One, the Phallus as a
desire for a sociosymbolic order that assures masculine dominance. Žižek
(2004) contends that only a psychoanalytic exposition of the disavowed
beliefs and suppositions of the United States political elite can get at
the fundamental determinants of the Iraq War. Rose (1993) argues that it
was the paranoiac paradox of sensing both that there is every reason to
be frightened and that everything is under control that allowed Thatcher
"to make this paradox the basis of political identity so that subjects
could take pleasure in violence as force and legitimacy while always
locating 'real' violence somewhere else---illegitimate violence and
illicitness increasingly made subject to the law" (p. 64).
[[Stavrakakis]{.mark}]{.underline} (1999) [[advocates that
we]{.underline}]{.mark} recognize and [[traverse
the]{.underline}]{.mark} residues of [[utopian
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark} in our contemporary political imagination.1
[Might not the psychoanalytic [interpretation of powerful
figures]{.mark} (Bush, Bin Laden, or whomever), collective subjects
(nations, ethnic groups, and so forth), [or]{.mark} urgent ["political"
situations **register** ]{.mark}**an [anxiety]{.mark} regarding
political impotence** or "castration" that is **pacified and modified**
by the fantasmatic frame [wherein the psychoanalytically
inclined]{.mark} political [theorist situates]{.mark} him- or herself
[as diagnosing]{.mark} or interpretively intervening in the lives of
political figures]{.underline}, collective political subjects, [or
complex political [situations]{.mark} with the idealized efficacy of a
successful clinical intervention]{.underline}? If so, then **[the
question is: [are the contributions of psychoanalytic]{.mark}ally
inclined political [theory anything more than tantalizing menu]{.mark}
cards [for meals it cannot deliver?]{.mark}]{.underline}** As I said,
the worry is twofold. These are two folds of a related problem, which is
this: [might the very seductiveness of psychoanalytic theory and
practice]{.underline}---specifically, the seductiveness of its political
promise---[register the lasting eclipse of the political and the
objectivity of the social, respectively]{.underline}? In other words,
[[might not every**thing that makes psychoanalytic**]{.mark} **theory
and [practice]{.mark} so politically [attractive]{.mark}**
[indicate]{.mark} precisely the necessity of wide-ranging
social/institutional [transformations that far exceed the powers of
psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark} And so, [might not the
politically salient [transformations]{.mark} of subjectivity [to which
psychoanalysis can contribute overburden subjectivity as the]{.mark}
site of [political transformation, **blinding us to** ]{.mark}**the
necessity of largescale [institutional reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}?
Indeed, might not massive institutional transformations be necessary
conditions for the efficacy of psychoanalytic practice, both personally
and politically? Further, [might not the so-called interventions and
proposals of psychoanalytically inclined political [theory]{.mark}
similarly [sidestep the question of the institutional]{.mark}
transformations [necessary for]{.mark} their [realization, and]{.mark}
so [conspire with]{.mark} our blindness to the enormous institutional
[impediments to a]{.mark} progressive [political
future?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Let me begin by posing two questions: What might a theory of discourse
contribute to feminism? And what, therefore, should feminists look for
in a theory of discourse? I suggest that a conception of discourse can
help us understand at least four things, all of which are interrelated.
First, it can help us understand how [people's social identities are
**fashioned and altered over time**]{.underline}. Second, it can help us
understand how, [under conditions of inequality, social
groups]{.underline} in the sense of collective agents [are formed and
unformed]{.underline}. Third, [a conception of discourse can illuminate
how the cultural hegemony of dominant groups in society is secured and
contested]{.underline}. Fourth and finally, [it can shed light on the
prospects for **emancipatory social change** and **political
practice**]{.underline}. Let me elaborate. First, consider the uses of a
conception of discourse for understanding social identities. The basic
idea here is that [people's social identities are complexes of meanings,
networks of interpretation]{.underline}. [To have a social
identity]{.underline}, to be a woman or a man, for example, just [is to
live and to act under a set of descriptions]{.underline}. [These
descriptions]{.underline}, of course, [are **not** simply secreted by
peoples's bodies; nor are they simply exuded by people's
psyches]{.underline}. [Rather, they are drawn from the **fund of
interpretive possibilities** available to agents in specific
societies]{.underline}. It follows that, in order [to
understand]{.underline} the gender dimension of [social identity, [it
**does not suffice** to study]{.mark} biology or
[psychology]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [[one must study]{.mark} the
**[historically specific]{.mark} social [practices]{.mark}** through
which cultural descriptions of gender are produced and
circulated]{.underline}.3 Moreover, [social [identities are]{.mark}
**exceedingly complex**]{.underline}. [They are [knitted together from a
**plurality of**]{.mark} **different [descriptions]{.mark}** arising
from a plurality of different signifying practices]{.underline}. Thus,
no one is simply a woman; one is rather, for example, a white, Jewish,
middle-class woman, a philosopher, a lesbian, a socialist, and a
mother.4 [Because everyone acts in a plurality of social contexts,
moreover, the different descriptions comprising any individual's social
identity fade in and out of focus]{.underline}. Thus, one is not always
a woman in the same degree; in some contexts, one's womanhood figures
centrally in the set of descriptions under which one acts; in others, it
is peripheral or latent.5 Finally, [it is **[not]{.mark} the case** that
people's social identities are constructed once and for all and
definitively [fixed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Rather, they]{.mark} **alter
over time**, **[shift]{.mark}ing [with shifts in]{.mark} agents'
[practices]{.mark}** and affiliations]{.underline}. Even the way in
which one is a woman will shift--- as it does, to take a dramatic
example-, when one becomes a feminist. In short, [social identities are
discursively constructed in historically specific social contexts; they
are complex and plural; and they shift over time]{.underline}. One use
of a conception of discourse for feminist theorizing, then, is in
understanding social identities in their full socio-cultural complexity,
thus in [demystifying static, single variable, **essentialist views** of
gender identity]{.underline}. A second use of a conception of discourse
for feminist theorizing is in understanding the formation of social
groups. How does it happen, under conditions of domination, that people
come together, arrange themselves under the banner of collective
identities, and constitute themselves as collective social agents? How
do class formation and, by analogy, gender formation occur? Clearly,
[**group formation** involves shifts in people's social identities and
therefore also in their relation to social discourse]{.underline}. One
thing that happens here is that pre-existing strands of identities
acquire a new sort of salience and centrality. These strands, previously
submerged among many others, are reinscribed as the nub of new
self-definitions and affiliations.6 For example, in the current wave of
feminist ferment, many of us who had previously been "women" in some
taken-for-granted way have now become " women" in the very different
sense of a discursively self-constituted political collectivity. [In the
process, we have remade entire regions of social discourse]{.underline}.
We have invented new terms for describing social reality--- for example,
"sexism," " sexual harassment," " marital, date, and acquaintance rape,"
" labor force sex-segregation," " the double shift," and "
wife-battery." We have also invented new language games such as
consciousness raising and new, institutionalized public spheres such as
the Society for Women in Philosophy.7 The point is that [the formation
of social groups proceeds by struggles over social
discourse]{.underline}. [Thus, a conception of discourse is
useful]{.underline} here, [both for understanding group formation and
for coming to grips with the closely related issue of socio-cultural
hegemony]{.underline}. ["Hegemony"]{.underline} is the Italian Marxist
Antonio Gramsci's term for the discursive face of power. It [is the
power to establish the "common sense" or "doxa" of a
society]{.underline}, the fund of self-evident descriptions of social
reality that normally go without saying.8 This includes the power to
establish authoritative definitions of social situations and social
needs, the power to define the universe of legitimate disagreement, and
the power to shape the political agenda. Hegemony, then, expresses the
advantaged position of dominant social groups with respect to discourse.
It is a concept that allows us to recast the issues of social identity
and social groups in the light of societal inequality. How do pervasive
axes of dominance and subordination affect the production and
circulation of social meanings? How does stratification along lines of
gender, "race," and class affect the discursive construction of social
identities and the formation of social groups? [The notion of hegemony
points to the intersection of power, inequality, and
discourse]{.underline}. However, [it does not entail that the ensemble
of descriptions that circulate in society comprise a monolithic and
seamless web, nor that dominant groups exercise an absolute, topdown
control of meaning]{.underline}. On the contrary, ["hegemony" designates
a process wherein cultural authority is **negotiated and
contested**]{.underline}. It presupposes that [societies contain a
plurality of discourses and discursive sites, a plurality of positions
and perspectives from which to speak]{.underline}. [Of course, not all
of these have equal authority]{.underline}. Yet conflict and
contestation are part of the story. Thus, one use of a conception of
discourse for feminist theorizing is to shed light on the processes by
which the socio-cultural hegemony of dominant groups is achieved and
contested. What are the processes by which definitions and
interpretations inimical to women's interests acquire cultural
authority? [What are the prospects for mobilizing counter-hegemonic
feminist definitions and interpretations to create broad oppositional
groups and alliances?]{.underline} The link between these questions and
**[[emancipatory political practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** is, I
believe, fairly obvious. [A conception of discourse that lets us examine
identities, groups, and hegemony in the ways I have been describing
would be of considerable use]{.underline} to feminist practice. [It
[would valorize]{.mark} the [**empowering dimensions** of]{.mark}
discursive [struggles without leading to **"culturalist" retreats from
political engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 In addition, [the right
kind of conception would counter the disabling assumption that women are
just passive victims of male dominance]{.underline}. [That assumption
over-totalizes male dominance, treating men as the only social agents-
and rendering inconceivable our own existence as feminist theorists and
activists]{.underline}. In contrast, [the sort of conception I have been
proposing would help us understand how, even under conditions of
subordination, women participate in the making of culture]{.underline}.
2. LACANIANISM AND THE LIMITS OF STRUCTURALISM In light of the
foregoing, what sort of conception of discourse will be useful for
feminist theorizing? What sort of conception best illuminates social
identities, group formation, hegemony, and emancipatory practice? In the
postwar period, two approaches to theorizing language became influential
among political theorists. The first is [the structuralist
model]{.underline}, which [studies language as a symbolic system or
code]{.underline}. [Derived from Saussure, this model is **presupposed**
in the version of [Lacanian theory]{.mark}]{.underline} I shall be
concerned with here; in addition, it is abstractly negated but not
entirely superseded in deconstruction and in related forms of French
"women's writing." The second influential approach to theorizing
language may be called [the pragmatics model]{.underline}, which
[studies language at the level of discourses, as historically specific
social practices of communication]{.underline}. Espoused by such
thinkers as Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, and Pierre Bourdieu, this
model is operative in some but not all dimensions of the work of Julia
Kristeva and Luce Irigaray. In the present section of this chapter, I
shall argue that [the]{.underline} first, [structuralist model is of
only limited usefulness for feminist theorizing]{.underline}. Let me
begin by noting that [[there are **good**]{.mark} **prima facie
[reasons]{.mark}**]{.underline} for feminists [[to be
**suspicious**]{.mark} of the structuralist model]{.underline}. [[This
model constructs its object]{.mark} of study [by **abstracting**]{.mark}
from exactly what we need to focus on, namely, the [**social practice**
and]{.mark} social **[context]{.mark}** of communication]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the abstraction from practice and context are among the
founding gestures of Saussurean linguistics]{.underline}. [Saussure
began by splitting signification into langue, the symbolic system or
code, and parole, speakers' uses of language in communicative practice
or speech]{.underline}. He then made the first of these, langue, the
proper object of the new science of linguistics, and relegated the
second, parole, to the status of a devalued remainder.10 At the same
time, [Saussure insisted that the study of langue be synchronic rather
than diachronic; he]{.underline} thereby [posited his object of study as
static and atemporal, **abstracting it from historical
change**]{.underline}. Finally, [the founder of structuralist
linguistics posited that langue was indeed a single system; he made its
unity and systematicity consist in the putative fact that every
signifier, every material, signifying element of the code, derives its
meaning positionally through its difference from all of the
others]{.underline}. Together, these founding operations render the
structuralist approach of limited utility for feminist purposes.\"
[Because [it]{.mark} abstracts from parole, the structuralist model
**[brackets]{.mark} questions of [practice]{.mark}, agency, and the
speaking subject**]{.underline}. [Thus, it **[cannot]{.mark}** shed
light on the discursive practices through which social identities and
social groups are formed]{.underline}. [Because this approach brackets
the diachronic]{.underline}, moreover, [it will not tell us anything
about shifts in identities and affiliations over time]{.underline}.
Similarly, [because it abstracts from the social context of
communication, the model brackets issues of power and
inequality]{.underline}. Thus, [it cannot [illuminate the processes by
which]{.mark} cultural [hegemony is]{.mark} **secured and
[contested]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, [because the model theorizes
the fund of available linguistic meanings as a single symbolic system,
[it lends itself to a **monolithic view**]{.mark} of signification [that
**denies tensions and contradictions**]{.mark} among social
meanings]{.underline}. In short, [[by reducing discourse to a "symbolic
system,\" the]{.mark} structuralist [model **evacuates social
agency**]{.mark}**, social [conflict, and]{.mark} social
[practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12 Let me now try to illustrate these
problems by means of a brief discussion of Lacanianism. By
"Lacanianism,\" I do not mean the actual thought of Jacques Lacan, which
is far too complex to tackle here. I mean, rather, an ideal-typical
neo-structuralist reading of Lacan that is widely credited among
English-speaking feminists.\'5 In discussing " Lacanianism," I shall
bracket the question of the fidelity of this reading, which could be
faulted for overemphasizing the influence of Saussure at the expense of
other, countervailing influences, such as Hegel.\'4 For my purposes,
however, this ideal-typical, Saussurean reading of Lacan is useful
precisely because it evinces with unusual clarity the difficulties that
beset many conceptions of discourse that are widely considered "
poststructuralist" but that remain wedded in important respects to
structuralism. [Because their attempts to break free of structuralism
remain abstract, such conceptions tend finally to **recycle
it**]{.underline}. Lacanianism, as discussed here, is a paradigm case of
"neostructuralism." \'5 At first sight, neo-structuralist Lacanianism
seems to promise some advantages for feminist theorizing. By conjoining
the Freudian problematic of the construction of gendered subjectivity to
the Saussurean model of structural linguistics, it seems to provide each
with its needed corrective. The introduction of the Freudian problematic
promises to supply the speaking subject that is missing in Saussure and
thereby to reopen the excluded questions about identity, speech, and
social practice. Conversely, the use of the Saussurean model promises to
remedy some of Freuds deficiencies. By insisting that gender identity is
discursively constructed, Lacanianism appears to eliminate lingering
vestiges of biologism in Freud, to treat gender as sociocultural all the
way down, and to render it in principle more open to change. Upon closer
inspection, however, the promised advantages fail to materialize.
Instead, [Lacanianism [begins to look **viciously
circular**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On the one hand, it purports to
describe the process by which individuals acquire gendered subjectivity
through their painful conscription as young children into a pre-existing
phallocentric symbolic order]{.underline}. [Here the structure of [the
symbolic order is]{.mark} presumed to [determine]{.mark} the character
of individual [subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark}, on the
other hand, [the theory also purports]{.mark} to show that the symbolic
order must necessarily be phallocentric since the attainment of
subjectivity requires submission to "the Father s Law."]{.underline}
Here, [conversely, the nature of individual [subjectivity]{.mark}, as
dictated by an autonomous psychology, is presumed to [determine
the]{.mark} character of [the symbolic order]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[One
result]{.mark} of this circularity [is]{.mark} an apparently **[ironclad
determinism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Dorothy Leland has noted, [the
theory casts the developments it describes as necessary, invariant, and
unalterable]{.underline}.16 Phalloc[entrism, womans disadvantaged place
in the symbolic order, the encoding of cultural authority as masculine,
the impossibility of describing a nonphallic sexuality--- in short, any
number of **[historically contingent]{.mark}** trappings of male
[dominance]{.mark}--- [now appear as **invariable**]{.mark} **features
of the human condition**]{.underline}. Womens
[subordination]{.underline}, then, [is **inscribed** as the **inevitable
destiny of civilization**]{.underline}. I can spot [several spurious
steps in this reasoning]{.underline}, some of which [have their roots in
the presupposition of the structuralist model]{.underline}. First, [to
the degree Lacanianism has succeeded in eliminating
biologism]{.underline}--- and that is dubious for reasons I shall not go
into here**[17]{.underline}** --- [it has replaced it with
**psychologism**, the **untenable view** that autonomous psychological
imperatives given independently of culture and history can dictate the
way they are interpreted and acted on within culture and
history]{.underline}. \[INSERT FOOTNOTE 17\] 17 Here I believe one can
properly speak of Lacan. [Lacan's claim to have overcome biologism rests
on his insistence that the phallus is not the penis]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, many feminist critics have shown that [he fails
to prevent the collapse of the symbolic signifier into the
organ]{.underline}. [The clearest indication of this failure is his
claim, in The Meaning of the Phallus," that the phallus becomes the
master signifier because of its "turgidity" which suggests " the
transmission of vital flow" in copulation]{.underline}. See Jacques
Lacan, " T h e Meaning of the Phallus," in Feminine Sexuality: Jacques
Lacan and the ecole freudienne, eds. Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline
Rose, New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1982. \[END FOOTNOTE 17\]
[Lacanianism falls prey to psychologism]{.underline} to the extent that
it [claims that the phallocentricity of the symbolic order is required
by the demands of an enculturation process that is itself independent of
culture]{.underline}.18 [If one half of Lacanianism's circular argument
is **vitiated by psychologism**, then the other half is vitiated
by]{.underline} what I shall call **[symbolicism]{.underline}**. By
symbolicism I mean, first, [[the **homogenizing reification** of diverse
signifying practices into a monolithic]{.mark} and all-pervasive
["symbolic order,"]{.mark} and]{.underline} second, [the
[endowing]{.mark} of [that]{.mark} order [with]{.mark} an exclusive and
[unlimited causal power to fix]{.mark} people's [subjectivities]{.mark}
once and for all]{.underline}. Symbolicism, then, is an operation
whereby [[the]{.mark} structuralist [abstraction langue is **troped into
a quasi-divinity**]{.mark}, a normative "symbolic order" [whose power to
shape identities]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~dwarfs~~ [\[[renders
insignificant]{.mark}\] to the **point of extinction** that of mere
historical [institutions]{.mark} and practices]{.underline}. Actually,
as Deborah Cameron has noted, Lacan himself equivocates on the
expression "the symbolic order." \'9 Sometimes he uses this expression
relatively narrowly to refer to Saussurean langue, the structure of
language as a system of signs. In this narrow usage, Lacanianism would
be committed to the implausible view that the sign system itself
determines individuals' subjectivities independently of the social
context and social practice of its uses. At other times, Lacan uses the
expression " the symbolic order" far more broadly to refer to an amalgam
that includes not only linguistic structures, but also cultural
traditions and kinship structures, the latter mistakenly equated with
social structure in general.20 In this broad usage, Lacanianism would
conflate the ahistorical structural abstraction langue with variable
historical phenomena like family forms and childrearing practices;
cultural representations of love and authority in art, literature, and
philosophy; the gender division of labor; forms of political
organization and of other institutional sources of power and status. The
result would be a conception of ["the symbolic order"]{.underline} that
[**essentializes and homogenizes** contingent historical practices and
traditions, erasing tensions, contradictions, and **possibilities for
change**]{.underline}. [This would be a conception]{.underline},
moreover, [that is **so broad** that the claim that it determines the
structure of subjectivity risks **collapsing into an empty
tautology**]{.underline}.21 The combination of psychologism and
symbolicism in [Lacanianism]{.underline} results in a conception of
discourse that is of limited usefulness for feminist theorizing. To be
sure, this conception offers an account of the discursive construction
of social identity. However, it [is not an account that can make sense
of the complexity and multiplicity of social identities, the ways they
are woven from a plurality of discursive strands]{.underline}. Granted,
[Lacanianism]{.underline} stresses that the apparent unity and
simplicity of ego identity is imaginary, that the subject is irreparably
split both by language and drives. But this [insistence on fracture
**does not** lead to an appreciation of the diversity of the
socio-cultural discursive practices from which identities are
woven]{.underline}. [It leads, rather, to a **unitary view** of the
human condition as inherently tragic]{.underline}. In fact, [Lacanianism
differentiates identities only in binary terms, along the single axis of
having or lacking the phallus]{.underline}. As Luce Irigaray has shown,
[this phallic conception of sexual difference is not an adequate basis
for understanding femininity]{.underline}22--- [nor]{.underline}, I
would add, [masculinity]{.underline}. Still less, then, is it able to
shed light on other dimensions of social identities, including
ethnicity, color, and social class. [Nor could the theory be emended to
incorporate these manifestly historical phenomena, given its postulation
of an ahistorical, tension-free "symbolic order" equated with
kinship]{.underline}.23 Moreover, [Lacanianism's account of identity
construction cannot account for **identity shifts over
time**]{.underline}. [It is committed to the general psychoanalytic
proposition that]{.underline} gender identity (the only kind of
[identity]{.underline} it considers) [is basically fixed once and for
all]{.underline} with the resolution of the Oedipus complex. Lacanianism
equates this resolution with the child's entry into a fixed, monolithic,
and all-powerful symbolic order. Thus, [it actually increases the degree
of identity fixity found in classical Freudian theory]{.underline}. It
is true, as Jacqueline Rose points out, that the theory stresses that
gender identity is always precarious, that its apparent unity and
stability are always threatened by repressed libidinal drives.24 But
this [emphasis on precariousness **is not** an opening onto genuine
historical thinking about shifts in peoples social
identities]{.underline}. [**On the contrary**, it is an insistence on a
permanent, **ahistorical** condition, since for Lacanianism the only
alternative to fixed gender identity is psychosis]{.underline}. If
[Lacanianism]{.underline} cannot provide an account of social identity
that is useful for feminist theorizing, then it [is unlikely to help us
understand the formation of social groups]{.underline}. [For
Lacanianism, affiliation falls under the rubric of the
imaginary]{.underline}. [To affiliate with others, to align oneself with
others in a social movement, would be to fall prey to the illusions of
the imaginary ego]{.underline}. [It would be to deny loss and lack, to
seek an impossible unification and fulfillment]{.underline}. Thus, [from
the perspective of Lacanianism, **collective movements** would by
definition be vehicles of delusion; they could not even in principle be
emancipatory]{.underline}.25 Moreover, [insofar as group formation
depends on linguistic innovation, it is untheorizable from the
perspective of Lacanianism]{.underline}. [Because Lacanianism posits a
fixed, monolithic symbolic system and a speaker who is wholly subjected
to it, it is inconceivable that there could ever be any linguistic
innovation]{.underline}. [Speaking subjects could only ever reproduce
the existing symbolic order; they could not possibly alter
it]{.underline}. [From this perspective, the question of cultural
hegemony is **blocked from view**]{.underline}. [There can be **no
question** as to how the cultural authority of dominant groups in
society is established and contested, no question of unequal
negotiations between different social groups occupying different
discursive positions]{.underline}. [For Lacanianism]{.underline}, on the
contrary, [there is simply]{.underline} " f/ie symbolic order," [a
single universe of discourse that is so systematic, so all-pervasive, so
monolithic that one **cannot even conceive** of such things as
**alternative perspectives**, multiple discursive sites, **struggles
over social meanings**, contests between hegemonic and
**counterhegemonic definitions of social situations**, conflicts of
interpretation of social needs]{.underline}. [One cannot even conceive,
really, of a plurality of different speakers]{.underline}. [With the way
blocked to a political understanding of identities, groups, and cultural
hegemony, the way is also **blocked** to an understanding of **political
practice**]{.underline}. For one thing, [there is **no conceivable
agent** of such practice]{.underline}. [Lacanianism posits a view of the
person as a non-sutured congeries of three moments, none of which can
qualify as a political agent]{.underline}. [The speaking subject is
simply the grammatical "I," a shifter wholly subjected to the symbolic
order; it can only and forever reproduce that order]{.underline}. The
ego is an imaginary projection, deluded about its own stability and
self-possession, hooked on an impossible narcissistic desire for unity
and self-completion; it therefore can only and forever tilt at
windmills. Finally, [there is the ambiguous unconscious, sometimes an
ensemble of repressed libidinal drives, sometimes the face of language
as Other, but **never** anything that could count as a social
agent]{.underline}.

**It's [wrong]{.underline}.**

[[Despite the]{.underline}]{.mark} apparent [**[bleakness and
antiutopianism]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an assessment [of human
nature]{.mark}]{.underline} as [being [perturbed by an irreducible inner
antagonism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline}, surprisingly,
what might be described as [a liberating aspect to]{.underline} this
[splitting]{.underline} [[of the drives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Since
drives are]{.mark} [essentially dysfunctional]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[subjects are able to act otherwise than as would be
dictated]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} instinctually
[[compelled]{.mark} pursuits of **[gratification, satisfaction, and
pleasure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, **[[subjects are forced to be
free]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [since]{.underline}, for such beings, [the
mandate of nature is forever missing]{.underline}. [Severed from a
strictly biological master-program]{.underline} and saddled with a
conflict-ridden, heterogeneous jumble of contradictory
impulses---[impulses mediated by an inconsistent, unstable web of
multiple representations]{.underline}, indicated by Lacan\'s "barring"
of the Symbolic Other---the parlêtre [has no choice but to bump up
against the unnatural void of its autonomy]{.underline}. The
confrontation with this void is frequently avoided. The true extent of
one\'s autonomy is, due to its sometimes-frightening implications, just
as often relegated to the shadows of the unconscious as those
heteronomous factors secretly shaping conscious thought and behavior.
[The [contradictions arising from the]{.mark} **[conflicts internal to
the libidinal economy]{.mark}** [mark]{.mark} the [precise places where
a **freedom transcending mundane materiality has a chance**]{.mark}
briefly to flash into effective existence]{.underline}; [such [points of
**breakdown in the deterministic nexus of the drives**]{.mark} [clear
the space for the **sudden emergence of something other than**]{.mark}
**the [smooth continuation]{.mark}** of the default physical and
sociopsychical "run of things."]{.underline} Moreover, [if the drives
were fully functional]{.underline}---and, hence, would not prompt a
mobilization of a series of defensive distancing mechanisms struggling
to transcend this threatening corpo-Real---[humans would be animalistic
automatons]{.underline}, namely, [creatures of nature]{.underline}.
**[[The pain of a malfunctioning]{.mark}, internally conflicted
[libidinal economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is a discomfort signaling a
**capacity to be an autonomous subject**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is a
pain even more essential to human autonomy than what Kant identifies as
the guilt-inducing burden of duty and its corresponding pangs of
anxious, awe-inspiring respect. Whereas Kant treats the discomfort
associated with duty as a symptom-effect of a transcendental freedom
inherent to rational beings, the reverse might (also) be the case: Such
freedom is the symptom-effect of a discomfort inherent to libidinal
beings. Completely "curing" individuals of this discomfort, even if it
were possible, would be tantamount to divesting them, whether they
realize it or not, of an essential feature of their dignity as subjects.
[As Lacan might phrase it, the split Trieb is]{.underline} the sinthome

If the second order of politics in the age of the spectacle is to

our task is to \[End Page 220\] recognize our own shameful compromises

that intellectualism and the ideas it generates, the imaginaries it
creates, and the visions of the world it endorses shares an intimate
relationship with violence both in its complicity with violence and as
an act of violence. Having said this, we cannot divorce here the idea of
the desiring subject of violence from wider systemic relations and
historical configurations. **[[Too often]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the

pleasure that is collectively indulged. As decadence and despair are
normalised in the wider culture---though this is very different from
accomplished in the goal to remove all dissent---people are increasingly
exploited for their pleasure quotient while any viable notion of the
social is subordinated to the violence of a deregulated market economy
and its production of cultures of cruelty.

#### NATO isn't capitalist or imperialist\-\--its strength and cohesion militates against authoritarian and militarist backsliding 

**Hudson '22** \[Sam; March 29; Natural Sciences at Cambridge; Areo,
"The Progressive Case for NATO,"
https://areomagazine.com/2022/03/29/the-progressive-case-for-nato/\]

Some of NATO's left-wing critics argue that it is the organisation's
expansion into Eastern Europe that has forced Russia onto a paranoid
warpath, but this argument does not hold water either. [[Countries join
NATO by democratic consent]{.underline}]{.mark}---a fact that only the
most absurd CIA conspiracy theories can explain away. [[Had Russia been
a good neighbour]{.underline}]{.mark} to its Eastern European former
client and satellite states, perhaps [[NATO would not have expanded
beyond Germany.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead, Russian leaders since
Boris Yeltsin have viewed Russia's former sphere as the country's birth
right, crushing nascent separatist movements within Russia's own borders
with horrific brutality, while supporting pro-Russian separatist
movements in Moldova and Georgia. [This cynical policy would have
collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions had it not devolved
into the blood-and-soil imperialism that we see playing out in the
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Yeltsin may be remembered through
rose-tinted glasses as a cheery drunkard, but his desperation to
maintain Russia's status as a superpower set Russian foreign policy on
course to where it is today. Putin has now simply taken that foreign
policy to its logical conclusion. No wonder much of Eastern Europe
wished to join NATO, the one alliance that could give these nations
credible anti-imperialist protection.

[[**NATO** is]{.mark} too often [viewed
**reductively**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [as an **American sphere of
influence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in much the same way as the Warsaw
Pact countries comprised a Soviet sphere of influence]{.underline}. [It
is true that a degree of alignment with some American foreign policy
goals and values is implicit in NATO membership, but this is
in]{.underline} **[no way equivalent]{.underline}** [to the influence
the Soviets exerted over their client states during the Cold
War.]{.underline} [**[NATO members]{.underline}** [are sovereign states
and have]{.underline} **[acted against US
interests]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the past.]{.underline} [For
instance]{.underline}, [[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} recently (wrongly)
[[invaded America's Kurdish allies in Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Likewise, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} (rightly) [[refused US requests
for assistance during the invasion of Iraq.]{.underline}]{.mark} As
these concrete actions demonstrate, NATO is far more than an
American-led sphere and has remained grounded in the democratic
principles upon which it was founded, even though the US is able to
leverage more power than it did at NATO's founding in 1949. The
characterisation of NATO as a tool of American imperialism, then, is
demonstrably false.

[Criticism of NATO is **not limited** to the **realm of geopolitical
machinations**]{.underline}. [Many on [the left see]{.mark} it as [a
vessel for]{.mark} American business interests and]{.underline}
**[neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[History has shown
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It was Clement Attlee's British
[[Labour]{.underline}]{.mark} government that [[signed
the]{.underline}]{.mark} North Atlantic [[Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} in
1947, founding NATO. And while [[Article 2]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
treaty stipulates that signatories should "eliminate conflict in their
international economic policies" and "encourage economic collaboration,"
this [[did not prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} Attlee's government from
being one of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} most
[[transformative]{.underline}]{.mark} in British history: it established
the modern [[welfare state and]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to be
widely celebrated by the Labour left today. [[Norway and
Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}, both founding members of NATO,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [[flourishing social
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} where social democrats and democratic
socialists have spent more time in power than in opposition since 1949.

Clearly, **[[NATO has not impeded progressive political
movements]{.underline}]{.mark}** [within its member states]{.underline}.
In fact, [the **existence** of [**NATO** **has had
positive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[repercussions]{.underline}** [for
the European left]{.underline}.]{.mark} The
[[unification]{.underline}]{.mark} of Western Europe under a single
military alliance [[forced member states to abandon the **nationalist
and revanchist grudges**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[dogged European politics for
centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[political moderation this
encouraged has meant that]{.underline}]{.mark}---even in those European
countries where social democrats have not had much political
success---the [[right-wing opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} generally
[[takes the form of]{.underline}]{.mark} Christian Democrats, who are
far more [[moderate]{.underline}]{.mark} than the reactionary,
nationalist conservative [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} that were
prominent prior to World War II. At the same time, the strength of
[[NATO's collective opposition to the Soviet Union
prevented]{.underline}]{.mark} that brand of **[[highly
authoritarian]{.underline}]{.mark}** and reactionary **[[socialism from
gaining traction]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe. Instead, [[leftist
movements have been]{.underline}]{.mark} largely characterised by a
**[[more liberal]{.underline}]{.mark}** tradition, which opposes
state-sponsored violence and emphasises human rights.

**[[Far from propping up the
m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ilitary-**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**omplex---[as NATO is]{.underline} often
[accused of doing]{.underline}---[[mutual defence]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the guarantee of peace have [[allowed]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[defence spending to be dramatically decreased]{.underline}]{.mark}**
throughout Europe. Part of this decrease may be attributed to the end of
the Cold War---but defence spending has been on the decline since the
1960s and this is at least partly due to the peace between Western
European neighbours that NATO has assured. In fact, defence spending has
arguably declined too much. Most nations in the alliance have still not
met NATO's defence spending target of 2% of GDP, leaving America to foot
the remaining bill. While [[this has meant that many European nations
have been able to develop their welfare states]{.underline}]{.mark},
this has been at the expense of Americans, who still face a particularly
vicious brand of capitalism with limited safety nets.

As Germany's overnight policy shift following the invasion of Ukraine
has shown, [[committing to the 2% target is not a tall order. It would
enable us to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[maintain our collective defence
while allowing America a much-needed financial reprieve. It would also
**diminish America's influence upon the alliance**,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[allowing European nations more of a say on collective defence
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and procurement. Hopefully, this would
encourage a shift away from the American military-industrial complex and
[[toward a more competitive, less monopolised defence
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[which holds less sway over
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

History is often viewed as an inexorable march of progress and
development from the barbarism of war to enlightened peace. This seems
to be the underlying thinking of NATO's left-wing detractors. But just
as Rome fell, [[peace and progress are never inevitable, nor should they
ever be taken for granted]{.underline}]{.mark}. Francis Fukuyama's
argument that we have reached the end of history has been widely derided
by many on the left who find the idea that humanity will not progress
past neoliberal democracy absurd. I agree with them---but in looking
only forward, they have failed to look back. [[The fact
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[they see capitalist liberal democracy as the
archenemy of peace]{.underline}]{.mark} and progress **[[is not
only]{.underline}]{.mark}** extraordinarily **[[privileged but
terrifyingly dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The west's [[terrible
interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} in Iraq and Afghanistan have
**[[confirmed this narrative for many]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
thinking explains Young Labour's tweets: NATO is to blame for Putin's
invasion, since neoliberalism is the sole force of evil in the world.
However, as the tanks rolled into Ukraine, history returned once more to
remind us that there are [[far darker, more dangerous enemies of
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is these enemies that **[[NATO
continues to forestall and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in doing so,
**[[allow for the peace and progress of which we Europeans are
beneficiaries today]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While it is a tragedy that
it has taken the whiplash of war for us to look back at history, [[I
hope these events may foster newfound gratitude for NATO and the peace
and progress that it has helped achieve]{.underline}]{.mark}. I look
forward to the day when the progressive left---of which I am proud to be
a part---will view NATO, alongside the NHS and the welfare state, as one
of Labour's greatest achievements.

[[It would be odd and troubling for the nation to]{.mark} merrily [work

browning of America, unfortunately, open up this possibility, which is
yet another evasion of social justice.7 [When I broach these
issues]{.underline}, or any of the particular issues discussed in this
book, [[the response I]{.mark} frequently [receive is that these issues
are red herrings that divert our attention away from the real
enemy]{.mark}, that [of white supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 [I am
dubious about this complaint]{.underline}; after all, [[focusing on
"white supremacy" **does not**]{.mark} **directly [address the
particulars of the interethnic confl icts]{.mark}** that arise from the
browning of America.]{.underline} [Perhaps]{.underline}, though, [these

would have us focus on how Latinos, Asian Americans]{.mark}, Americans
who identify as multiracial, [and immigrants adopt anti-black
racism]{.mark} and the privileges of whiteness as they assimilate into
American society]{.underline}. I think **[[the latter argument is
bogus]{.mark},]{.underline}** and chapter 3 is devoted in part to
explaining why. As for the former, I think "[[white supremacy" is too

justice.

and Paths of Activist Participation on the Left,"

Activism changes people\'s lives. Previous scholarship demonstrates that
the paths that people take into and through activism affect how their
lives are changed (Blee 2011; Fisher 2006; Fisher and McInerney 2012;
Han 2009; McAdam 1989, 1999; Munson 2010; Viterna 2006). For example,
**[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[people]{.mark} are recruited into
activism]{.underline} (Fisher 2006; Fisher and McInerney 2012) [and the
organizations that **they [join]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Han 2009; Munson
2008) [[makes a **difference**]{.underline} [for **how long** they
remain involved i]{.underline}]{.mark}[n activism]{.underline} [[and
**what types of activities they engage in**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These
studies, however, fail to distinguish between movements in terms of how
participation in one movement may influence an individual\'s activist
path differently than participation in another movement. Given that
activists live in a world of multiple, interacting social movements
(Evans and Kay 2008; Isaac and Christiansen 2002; Isaac, McDonald, and
Lukasik 2006; McAdam 1995; Meyer and Staggenborg 1996; Meyer and Tarrow
1998; Meyer and Whittier 1994; Minkoff 1997; Voss and Sherman 2000),
[the question arises as to whether or not **the sequence** through which
activists come into contact with movements]{.underline} [matters for how
they participate in activism]{.underline}. [**[The antiwar
movement]{.underline}** [is a very common gateway
into]{.underline}]{.mark} progressive/[**[left activism]{.underline}**.
In]{.mark} this article, we argue that [activists who are initiated into
activism through **antiwar events**]{.underline} [have different
patterns of movement [participation than those who are initiated into
activism through **another movement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This article
proceeds, first, by considering the extant scholarship on paths to and
through activism. These paths are shaped by the ebb and flow of
particular movements. [As protest cycles play out]{.underline},
[activists are presented with opportunities to adopt new issues or
migrate to other movements]{.underline}. Special attention is paid to
the antiwar movement and how its mobilization capacity is affected by
the nature of its main policy issue, war. Second, we argue that [antiwar
activists are likely to pursue paths that diverge from those of
other]{.underline} progressive/left [activists. Third]{.underline}, we
examine the methods and rationale for conducting a survey of 691
activists who attended the 2010 US Social Forum, one of the largest
assemblies of progressive/left activists in the United States. Fourth,
we explain sequence analysis as an approach to analyzing data on
activist paths. Fifth, [we demonstrate the distinctiveness of antiwar
activists' paths by estimating a series of regression models on the
results of the sequence analysis]{.underline}. We find that [[antiwar
activist paths are **more likely**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[\"spill over\"]{.underline}** [into other movements than are
other]{.underline}]{.mark} progressive/[[left activist
paths.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The article concludes by explaining the
aggregate consequences that these paths have for the broader environment
of]{.underline} progressive/left [activists]{.underline}. [[Social
movements have the potential **to change the world**]{.underline} [by
influencing **public opinion** and **state policies.**]{.underline}
[They]{.underline}]{.mark} [also]{.underline} have the potential to
[[change the lives of people who participate in
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} By [[drawing people into]{.mark} social
[activism]{.mark}, movements]{.underline}, in turn, [[expose people
to]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[further]{.mark} opportunities for
**political [participation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Meyer and Whittier
1994; Carrol and Ratner 1996; Osa 2003; Ansell 2003; Hadden and Tarrow
2007). Over time, individual activists may develop a multitude of ties
to different movements. We call an individual's sequential participation
in one or more movements an \"activist path.\" Activist paths matter for
a number of reasons. Initial mobilization may be linked to longterm
behaviors, whether they are political (Demerath, Marwell, and Aiken
1971; Marwell, Demerath, and Aiken 1987) or personal, such as having
children (McAdam 1989, 1999). The depth of participation in a movement
may be correlated with political behavior later in life, such as the
strength of left-leaning attitudes and the extent of political
participation (McAdam 1999: 121-2; Giugni 2007, 2008). Scholars draw
attention to the complexity and contingency of activist biographies.
Jasper (1999: 210-28) recounts the story of Geoff Meredith, a man who
was involved in environmental protest movements. Meredith had an
extensive history that touched on support for AIDS patients, avant-garde
art, and disabled rights, which depended on chance meetings with other
activists. Carroll and Ratner (1996) find that a significant proportion
of Vancouver-area activists participated in more than one type of
movement organization (e.g., indigenous rights and labor groups). Rojas
and Heaney (2009) report that [[79% of antiwar protesters]{.mark} in the
2000s had [participated in non-antiwar movements]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[suggesting a significant degree of \"**spillout**]{.mark}\"
from]{.underline} [established movements into new movements]{.underline}
(see also Hadden and Tarrow 2007) Individuals' characteristics may be
linked with specific types of activist biographies. Fisher and McInerney
(2012) find that people who are recruited to participate in an
organization through their social ties are less likely to continue to
participate in the organization than people that did not have prior
connections within the organization. Corrigall-Brown (2012: 53)
documents that religiosity, income, and political knowledge are
significant factors that predict an activist's path. Furthermore, her
research demonstrates that activists vary in their persistence, with
some activists maintaining heightened participation in multiple
movements and others participating on a more episodic basis. Social
contexts play a critical role in shaping activist paths. Viterna (2006)
discusses the lives of women in Salvadoran revolutionary groups and
finds that factors such as living in an urban environment predict mode
of participation. She argues that people who enter activism from
different starting points have distinct experiences. Caren, Ghoshal, and
Ribas (2011) conclude that the generational cohort that an individual is
a part of makes a difference for whether and how s/he participates in
activism. Munson (2010) analyzes the role that life-course transitions
have in determining activist biographies. His analysis of conservative
Christian college students suggests that graduation is an important life
course point that creates opportunities for activism. As academic
demands decrease near the senior year, movement organizations provide
new forms of participation for college students that deepen their
involvement in activism. Prior research on activist paths connects
individual and contextual factors to different types of paths. However,
it is an open question as to whether all movements generate the same
activist paths. Do movements differ in movement among political causes
over the life course of participants? The forces that shape activist
paths reflect the available options for political participation.
Activist paths are made possible, in part, by the structures of
multi-movement environments (Meyer and Whittier 1994; McAdam 1995;
Carrol and Ratner 1996). [**[Even though]{.underline}** [an individual
may be initially recruited through]{.underline}]{.mark} [[an
organization with]{.mark} **[a specific policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**[objective]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[activists]{.mark} may [embrace
**new causes**]{.mark} and participate]{.underline} [in a wide range of
movements]{.underline} over the course of their lives. [They may form
ties with activists who mobilize on behalf of **other causes** or **join
multiple organizations**]{.underline}. The result is that, over time,
individuals develop complex paths that reflect the different
opportunities presented to and seized by them (Corriggall-Brown 2012).
The multi-movement environment is an ever-changing social field because
individual movements rise and fall, affecting the options available to
activists. This fluctuation stimulates an individual\'s oscillation
between, or simultaneous participation within, multiple policy areas. A
movement is able to attract more recruits when its issues are viewed as
more salient by the public. There are numerous ways that an issue may
gain prominence. An exogenous event, such as a natural disaster, may
make one policy issue highly visible (Baumgartner and Jones 1993;
Kingdon 1997). Political entrepreneurs may attract attention by having
allies in the media discuss their issues (Sobieraj 2011). Conversely,
there are factors that may decrease the visibility of a movement,
leading to demobilization. A successful movement may demobilize once the
state institutes policies that were promoted by the movement (McAdam
1982). Electoral victories may be correlated with demobilization, as
partisans feel less inclined to protest once their party has taken
control of the legislative or executive branch (Heaney and Rojas 2011).
For these varied reasons, Tarrow (1994) notes that movements experience
regular oscillation, or \"protest cycles,\" over time. Protest cycles
factor into activist paths by encouraging individuals to migrate from
one issue domain to another. For example, the passage of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act encouraged a number of activists to move from the issue of
voting rights to the issue of poverty, while others adopted the issue of
nationalism (see Rojas 2007; Joseph 2006). Voting rights was one of the
issues used to unify the various elements of the civil rights coalition.
Once voting rights were addressed, attention turned to a host of other
issues, which contributed to the transformation of the civil rights
movement and led activists to migrate away from activities such as voter
registration and promoting poor people\'s rights. The fluctuating nature
of multi-movement environments means that activists are presented with a
changing menu of issues. As movements rise and fall, activists have
incentives to migrate to new movements or jointly participate in
multiple movements. Activists who participate in a receding movement do
not always completely demobilize. Rather, they often continue in some
other capacity by joining other movements, a path that is called the
\"transfer\" trajectory by Corrigall-Brown (2012: 6-7). [[Multi-movement
participation may allow]{.mark} the [activist to promote]{.mark} her/his
[**original issues** or to continue working for social change]{.mark}
**in a new context. These**]{.underline} options generate a variety of
paths reflecting the complexity and diversity of the multimovement
environment. Activist paths reflect the changing relationships between
individuals and movements, with some movements providing a platform for
continued political participation while other movements are in
remission. Thus, the connections between activists and movements
represent one type of abeyance structure -- the organizations, and other
social structures, that \"absorb the surplus of marginal groups\"
(Mizruchi 1983; Taylor 1989: 762). We argue above that the particular
path that an activist follows may depend on the way in which s/he
encounters the multi-movement environment. Involvement in one movement
may lead an individual down a different activist path than involvement
in another movement. In this section, we argue that [the antiwar
movement,]{.underline} specifically, [engages individuals in activism in
ways that tend to depart from the typical movement]{.underline}. As a
result, [involvement in antiwar activism has the potential to shape an
activist's path **differently** than is the case in many other
movements]{.underline}. The antiwar movement stands out from the typical
social movement in that its issue portfolio consists of a mix of
extremely urgent and very long-term issues. War is an extremely urgent
issue because whether or not people die today depends on the
government's actions today. For example, the largest internationally
coordinated demonstration in history was held on February 15, 2003,
slightly more than a month before the U.S. invasion of Iraq (Walgrave
and Rucht 2010). Many of the demonstrators believed that it was
necessary to act now to make a difference. After the U.S. invasion had
begun, demonstrations subsided. Part of this decline -- in the United
States, at least -- may have been due to a "rally around the flag"
effect (Lee 1977). But part of this decline was also likely due to the
perception by some that, with war already underway, political
opportunities for the movement had evaporated and the prospect of making
a difference had passed (Meyer and Corrigall-Brown 2005). The urgently
felt need to oppose war now often draws activists away from other
pursuits. Tom Hayden, a former leader of Students for a Democratic
Society who remained engaged in activism from the 1960s through the
2010s, recounts that: The story of my life is trying to do something
about my country, my community, and finding out there\'s another war. I
can\'t quite tell you why I get so upset by it. Except that I think that
when you\'re in a fight, in a war, and the blood is flowing, there\'s an
urgency that, like it or not, is not the same as chronic problems like
poverty (Hayden 2008). In fact, [antiwar organizers rely on the fact
that many of their supporters are likely to come from **allied
movements** focused on longer-term problems.]{.underline} [When antiwar
activists face the need for "sudden mobilizations," they structure their
calls for action in ways that are easily conformable with the goals of
other movements]{.underline} (Reese et al. 2010; Vasi 2006, 2011).
Hence, [antiwar mobilizations build their strength by welcoming hybrid
organizations that bridge **antiwar activism** with the concerns of
other movements]{.underline} (Goss and Heaney 2010). As a result,
[participation in antiwar activism becomes a way]{.underline}, not only
to rally against war, but also [to meet people tied to an array of other
causes on the progressive/left side of the political
spectrum.]{.underline} The antiwar movement is most successful in
mobilizing largest number of supporters when war is imminent. Yet, [[the
agenda of antiwar protests exposes participants to a range of
longer-term concerns about militarism and other threats to
peace]{.underline}, [such as the **extensive network**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S. military [bases]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline} (Yeo 2011) [[and the threat of **nuclear**]{.mark}
**war**]{.underline} (Meyer 1990). [[By offering a mix of **urgent** and
**long-term issues**]{.underline}, [the antiwar movement attracts a

1961 to 1983, Bearman and Everett (1993) uncover that peace
organizations and non-military intervention groups are highly central in
the network of progressive/left causes. Carroll and Ratner's (1996)
survey of activists from Vancouver, British Columbia reveals that peace
activists have a greater degree of multi-movement involvement than those
in any other movement category.

#### Specific issue focus is comparatively better than ideological critique -- their pedagogy gets sidelined and perpetuates the status quo

Important definitional considerations concern the temporal and issue
dimensions of antiwar protest. Opposition to a particular war motivates
some movements. These [ad hoc [movements seek to change **government
policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[regarding a]{.mark}
**[specific]{.mark}**]{.underline}, ongoing
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While [[this]{.mark} goal [may be linked
to other political agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}---be they
[**[anti-militarist]{.underline}**, **[feminist]{.underline}**,
**[anti-imperialist]{.underline}**]{.mark}, pro-democracy, and so
forth---these are secondary to the primary focus on bringing a
particular war to an end. The time-horizon of such movements is limited
and they typically dissolve or become inactive after the war ends. [[A
different type of]{.mark} antiwar [activism **transcends** protest
against specific wars.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It has a more **extensive
temporal dimension**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[greater]{.underline}]{.mark} [prominence of **[ideological]{.mark}ly
based motives and [goals]{.mark}**]{.underline}---such as pacifism, or
liberal internationalism that seeks to institutionalize world order
through the United Nations or a federation of countries. Ongoing
protests by secular pacifist groups or by peace churches against
armaments and militarism can have much more diffuse goals than do ad hoc
antiwar movements. In addition to disarmament, [these goals may
include]{.underline} strengthening of international disputeresolution
processes, [promoting]{.underline} international [understanding,
and]{.underline} peace [education]{.underline}. [One can designate ad
hoc protests "antiwar movements" and]{.underline} more **[ideologically
motivated]{.underline}** and long-running protests ["peace
movements"---]{.underline}although these categories are not mutually
exclusive and protesters against particular wars may also have
transcendent ideological motives. **[[Open-ended]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
more [**[ideologically motivated]{.underline}** [movements may have
**less potential**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} at least in the
near term, [[to]{.underline} **[influence public opinion and
change]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[public [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In part this reflects the more diffuse goals of ongoing peace movements:
Insofar as a single-issue focus tends to correlate with greater ability
to achieve movement goals (Gamson, 1990, 45-46), ad hoc antiwar groups
may be more successful. Of course, **[the task of ending a particular
war is more achievable than that of ending war generally]{.underline}**.
Peace groups whose demands include the expansion of international law at
the expense of state sovereignty are also politically radical in the
sense that they challenge "present distributions of wealth and power,"
and advocate replacing the authority over security policy claimed by
domestic elites (Ash, 1972, 230). Scholars debate how the radicalism of
a movement's demands affects its prospects for success, but the goal of
displacing established political authorities is highly correlated with
protest-group failure (Gamson, 1990, 42). [Antiwar groups that focus on
ending a particular war]{.underline} [do not generally seek to replace
the authority of domestic elites]{.underline}. Rather, [their challenge
is directed toward **particular policies**]{.underline} and practices
that [they believe depart from the responsible exercise of
officeholders' authority.]{.underline} Thus, a key question that bears
on questions of antiwar movements' effectiveness and influence is "What
is the relative importance to movement leaders of ideological goals
broader than ending a particular war?" It may also be useful to locate
movement goals on a continuum from domestic to international politics,
with world peace and disarmament goals located on the more international
and abstract end and also implying the potentially radical displacement
of domestic elites. [[Peace groups with **broader time horizons** and
**more abstract goals**]{.mark} **generally**]{.underline} [[find it
hard]{.mark}er [to achieve favorable]{.mark} public
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
**[[remain politically marginal]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Ad hoc
[protests with a **single agenda**]{.mark} of ending a]{.underline} [war
[have greater potential to attract **mainstream support** and to
contribute to **changes in policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Fiat K/Nuclear Technocracy K

#### The 1AC is both [necessary]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline} to challenge nuclear managerialism---we control uniqueness, debates about presidential nuclear authority [barely touch]{.underline} on the fallibility of deterrence and its status as a [cultural phenomenon]{.underline}---simply [reframing the terms]{.underline} as the 1AC did is [net better]{.underline} than normative policy debates. Nuclear weapons are an [ontological tangle]{.underline} of both [discursive]{.underline} and [material]{.underline} phenomena---investigating presidential authority can [widen the gaps]{.underline} in that tangle for [alternative rhetorical strategies]{.underline} to [gain traction]{.underline}.

Match Their Hatred': Nuclear Weapons, Rhetorical Democracy, and
Presidential Discourse," Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 37, No. 4,
Shadows of Democracy in Presidential Rhetoric (Dec., 2007), pp. 667-692,
dml) \[ableist language modifications denoted by brackets\]

In his related critique of rhetoric surrounding the global war on
terror, Robert [Ivie]{.underline} (2005) [establishes that the continued
degradation of American political culture stems from
long-standing]{.underline} [\"**demophobia**.\"]{.underline} [In this
condition, democracy is an ideal that must be enforced on international
others to preserve essential American interests]{.underline}.
[Simultaneously]{.underline}, however, [it is viewed as a **threatening
source of domestic dissent** and change that offends the republican and
federalist sense of political order]{.underline}. Ivie unflinchingly
probes this throbbing paradox in the history of U.S. war making: [[even
as they claim to serve democracy]{.mark} through military adventurism
abroad, U.S. [officials]{.mark} consistently [distort the interests of
their opponents and]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~cripple~~
[**[\[devastate\]]{.mark} citizen [deliberation]{.mark}**. They do so
through use of a \"decivilizing\" rhetoric that blends irrational,
aggressive, rigid, paranoid, and exceptionalist discourses to demonize
Other-ness and **delegitimate domestic dissent**]{.underline}. The conse
quences of [[this]{.mark} practice]{.underline}, Ivie argues, are grave
indeed. It [[degrades cultural diversity required for **successful
adaptation** to changing political conditions;]{.mark} it suppresses the
contradiction between the ideal of deliberation and the coercive use of
armed force; [it exacerbates tensions that lead to **war\'s irrevocable
destruction**; and it **marginalizes alternate formats** (such as
poetry) **that may serve political deliberation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Ivie\'s [solution]{.mark}]{.underline} to these problems
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} neither direct nor simple: he calls for
nothing less than [[a]{.mark} radical [reorientation to the
possibilities of]{.mark} political
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Here, [political [speakers
would]{.mark}]{.underline} privilege the comic pole of Burkean discourse
and [[reject]{.mark} short-sighted, [cynical]{.mark}, desperate, [and
self-indulgent discourses]{.mark}. Instead, political actors resign
themselves to continuous and \"adventurous\" struggle]{.underline}
(Peterson 2007) [and cultivate the civil possibilities of rhetoric and
performance for achieving **tolerance**, **coexistence**, and
**dialogue**]{.underline}. As a result, [militarist and [imperialist
discourses]{.mark} of national security that have attained unwarranted
authority and autonomy [may be **rejoined** with a **full range** of
democratic voices]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[The presidency is a rich site for this inquiry]{.mark}**. It is an
article of faith among rhetoricians that presidents not only represent
\"the people\" in their public speech but also strategically constitute
citizen identities]{.underline}---[and influence associated
actions]{.underline}---[by symbolically depicting the demos in ways that
**serve administration agendas**]{.underline} (Campbell and Jamieson
1990, 5-6; Ivie 2005, 162; Medhurst 1996, xvii). In characterizing its
tradi tions, essences, and missions, [[presidential rhetoric shapes how
the]{.mark} American [public imagines **the possibilities for its
participation in deliberation**]{.mark}. Their rhetoric also scripts the
content of frames and arguments that citizens might bring to that
activism]{.underline} (Stuckey and Antczak 1998, 420). Here, critics
note how presidential rhetoric provides specific, persuasive definitions
of conditions, events, actors, and policies (Kuypers 1997) and also,
more broadly, constitutes political culture as the source of meanings
and practices that sustain or subvert robust democracy. [One
example]{.underline} here [includes the negotiation by Cold War-era
presidents of the diminishing possibilities for heroic action created by
mutual assured destruction]{.underline} (MAD) [as a castrating
institutionalization of vulnerability]{.underline} (Beasley 2001, 22;
Chaloupka 1992; Engelhardt 1998).

These arguments guide my consideration of the relationship between
nuclear weapons, presidential rhetoric, and democracy. Specifically, I
am concerned with the following questions (see Beasley 2001): How and to
what extent has presidential rhetoric invoked the ideal of democracy as
a means or an end of nuclear deliberation? How have U.S. presidents
signified the demos in relation to the nuclear condition? How has that
discourse represented the actual diversity of interests animating
nuclear-political culture, and how has it articulated those interests
with the deliberation of nuclear policy? What specific images of nuclear
deliberation, of the presidency, and of nuclear citizenship are
subsequently produced? How do these \"necessary fictions\" correspond
with the actual nuclear desires of the American? How do they change over
time in relation to the evolving conditions of nuclear technology,
foreign policy, military strategy, and shifting relationships between
the presidency, Congress, the media, and the people? These questions are
heuristic. They cannot be fully answered here; they potentially yield
libraries and careers. Instead, they establish the scope and agenda of
my discussion below. In that discussion, I integrate existing findings
on nuclear democracy and presi dential rhetoric to consolidate their
claims, assess them in light of new theorizing about rhetorical
democracy, and offer suggestions for future work. First, however, I
begin with a general sketch of the relationship between nuclear weapons,
democracy, and rhetoric. Nuclear Weapons and Rhetorical Democracy

Liberal [scholars]{.underline} and other commentators [who assess the
relationship between nuclear weapons and democracy balance cynicism and
optimism]{.underline} (see, for example, Falk 1982; Mitchell 2000;
Peterson 2007). Their tone frequently evokes the morbid genres of
diagnosis, autopsy, and obituary, but [their]{.underline} grieving,
[condemnation, and pleading also seek a healing---if not outright
resurrection---of the nuclear-democratic body. This
activity]{.underline} typically [grows more active [during periods of
nuclear instability]{.mark}, in which [possibilities for **reconfiguring
the relationship** between nuclear officials and citizens are at least
temporarily opened]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the late Cold War and
post-Cold War periods, then, several speakers addressed this
relationship in the context of extraordinary changes in international
politics (Deudney 1995; Falk 1982; Rosen 1989; Rosow 1989; Stegenga
1988). Collectively, these speakers considered how [institutions
sediment around the artifact of nuclear weapons and]{.underline} how
[that process yields rhetoric that undermines the possibility of robust
democratic speech.]{.underline}

To varying degrees, [these critiques all assert a **fundamental
incompatibility** between nuclear weapons and the ideals of the
democratic state]{.underline}. They argue that [[oppres sive conditions
surrounding]{.mark} the development of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
[subvert the capabilities]{.mark} of citizens [to **acquire**,
**deliberate**, and **act** on info]{.mark}rmation concerning nuclear
policy]{.underline}. As a result, [[the nuclear public is characterized
as]{.mark} fragmented, alienated, uninformed, and [unable to participate
in deliberation with **forceful** and **reasoned**
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Commonly listed elements in this
indictment include: [an **official regime of secrecy** which
**suppresses** and **distorts** nuclear information; official
cultivation of a climate of permanent emergency that promotes public
inertia and **acquiescence to authoritarian rule**; **undue deference**
by]{.underline} nominal agents of [congressional oversight to the
interests of military elites]{.underline} and corporate defense
contractors; a timid and amnesiac news media; [and official demonization
of anti-nuclear dissent as extreme, irrelevant, and
unpatriotic]{.underline} (Rosen 1989). \"[This long train of official
lies]{.underline},\" argues James Stegenga (1988, 89), \"[has made truly
informed consent **an impossibility**]{.underline}\" (emphasis in
original).

[These critiques grow more valuable as they conceptualize the
relationships between rhetoric, democracy, and nuclear weapons. One
provocative claim here addresses how, under conditions of MAD, all
aspects of postwar American society were enrolled in the semiotic
project of signifying to the Communist enemy both capability and
willingness to use nuclear weapons in the national defense]{.underline}.
Rhetorical scholars have largely failed to appreciate how, [under these
conditions, the demos itself was conscripted and disciplined as an
element in this apparatus]{.underline}:

[**The continuous task of the president** and his subordinates is to
make their essentially incredible threats seem credible. So leaders have
wanted to present themselves as speaking forcefully on behalf of a
**monolithically supportive** American population. Naysayers needed to
be discouraged, the democratic debate on these matters **minimized**, in
the interest of promoting the credibility of the threats]{.underline}.
[The [people are]{.mark}]{.underline} meant or [[supposed to **avoid**
thinking about or speaking out on these matters]{.underline}]{.mark}.
(Stegenga 1988, 89, emphasis in original; see also Bok 1989)

[[Clarifying this]{.mark} condition [helps us to conceptualize
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [as **an ontological tangle** of
discursive and material phenomena]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It also
establishes that]{.underline}---far from being a mere adornment of
policy language---[[rhetoric is an **inherent**, **inevitable**, and
**reflexive** challenge for the nuclear nation-state]{.mark}. Official
rhetoric]{.underline}, in other words, [must be developed and deployed
in tandem with nuclear weapons to ensure that the whispers,
conversation, and shouts of the people do not subvert the]{.underline}
principal---and, according to Jacques Derrida\'s (1984) famous critique,
sole---[function of those weapons as **rhetoric**.]{.underline}

This interdependency between security and rhetoric is further clarified
in argu ments conceptualizing nuclear weapons as a legitimation crisis
for the liberal-democratic nation-state (Deudney 1995, 209). Rosow
(1989) argues that [traditional conceptualization of nuclear deterrence
as a strategic issue **obscures its status as** \"**a system of social
relations\"**]{.underline} (564). [In adopting [this alternate
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}, Rosow argues, [we [may **reclaim**
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [from official discourses]{.mark} that
have sheared off from their necessary grounding in---and authorization
by---the discourses of the nuclear life world]{.underline}: \"\[[Strate
gic\] [debate scarcely touches on the experience of nuclear deterrence
as a cultural]{.mark} and political-economic [production]{.mark}. . . .
The result is a **serious discontinuity** between the claims on which
the validity of nuclear policy rests . . . and the actual effects of
nuclear deterrence on the material well-being and consciousness in the
advanced capitalist West\"]{.underline} (564). [Rosow\'s
argument]{.underline} establishes the democratic status of nuclear
weapons as a rhetorical problem: he [conceptualizes nuclear [deterrence
as a discourse composed of \"interpretive claims\"]{.mark} and
imperative expressions and [theorizes its mediation of both
institutional structures and forms of identity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Viewed in this light, [we can recognize how, as artifacts, nuclear
weapons clarify a **fundamental contradiction** between their
destructive potential and their legitimating cultural discourses: \"The
same forces that are to produce peace and prosperity, i.e., science,
knowledge, rationality, also produce the tools for destroying the very
civilization they are designed to protect and whose values and future
they embody]{.underline}.\" Richard Falk (1982, 9) has suggested the
implications of this condition for a nuclear-rhetorical democracy:
\"[[Normative opposition to nuclear]{.mark} weapons or [doctrines
**inevitably draws into question** the legitimacy of state power and
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [[**more threatening to governmental
process** than a mere debate about]{.mark} the property of
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [as instruments of
statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" As a result, Rosow concludes,
[[changes in]{.mark} nuclear [policy may exacerbate inherent conflict
between]{.mark} \"the \[[cultural\] consciousness]{.mark} of democratic
citizenship\" [and the legitimacy of the state]{.mark}]{.underline}
(1989, 581). [As the state increas ingly rests its security on weapons
systems requiring centralized control and automated decision making, it
becomes **increasingly difficult** to assert that the legitimacy of
those weapons arises from authentic popular consent]{.underline}.
**[[Fault lines]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this hegemony [[are opened
when public rhetoric informs Americans about the international
consequences of nuclear imperialism and encourages their identification
with negatively affected groups]{.mark}. In the post-Cold War
era]{.underline}, Rosow predicted, [it will become increasingly
difficult for the state to normalize nuclear weapons as a familiar and
legitimate icon]{.underline}.

### Greer---Imperialism R/C---2AC

#### Imperialism explains settler colonialism, not the other way around. Their theory [neglects]{.underline} settler responsibility by [flattening]{.underline} history.

**Greer, 19**---professor of history and Canada Research Chair in
Colonial North America at McGill University (Allan, "Settler Colonialism
and Empire in Early America," The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 76,
No. 3 (July 2019), pp. 383-390, dml)

In January 1788 the First Fleet dropped anchor in Botany Bay and began
disgorging its cargo of convicts, marines, and officials to inaugurate
the colonial history of Australia. It arrived in the middle of [**global
revolutionary changes** that were ushering [in the modern
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Britain was industrializing, capitalism was
beginning to conquer the world, and political upheavals flying the
banner of popular sovereignty were bringing down established regimes
across the Americas and Europe. [**Fundamental [reconfigurations of
space]{.mark}** and **power [were central]{.mark}** to these
transformations]{.underline}. More than ever before, [territorial states
were taking shape with **clear**, **hard outer boundaries** and
**uniform internal [sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And within these
states, land was being reconfigured as private property. From Thomas
Jefferson's Virginia to Napoléon Bonaparte's expanded France, the
absolute rights of owners were proclaimed. [Political and property
[boundaries were]{.mark} now [construed as]{.mark} **precise** and
**[measurable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with fuzzy and overlapping claims
relegated to the past. [When it came to **[Indigenous]{.mark}
lands**]{.underline} and the processes of colonization in the wake of
the American Revolution, [there was **little room for ambiguity**: once
[territory]{.mark} entered the settler sphere, it [was supposed to
be]{.mark} **fully [subject to American sovereignty]{.mark}** and a
**settler property regime**. Indigenous peoples were **utterly
excluded**]{.underline}.1

Unlike the Americas, [Australia was **settled entirely** under the
auspices of the **modern**, **absolutist conception** of political and
economic space]{.underline}. Its history of colonizing was also marked
by some further peculiarities: sponsorship by a global superpower, an
absence of interimperial competition, and an indigenous population that
was, under these circumstances, militarily weak and lacking in
commodities that colonists might be willing to trade for. [The expansion
of settler control]{.underline}, by no means unopposed, [advanced
**rapidly**]{.underline} through massacres, forced migrations, and
assimilation. Given this power imbalance, the [invaders]{.underline} saw
no need to negotiate treaties of land cession. Instead they [treated the
country as **legally empty**---**terra nullius**---a **striking
contrast** with North and South America, where the centuries-long and
highly competitive European invasion had spawned **powerful coalescent
societies**]{.underline} such as the Mapuche, the Comanches, and the
Lakotas, capable of keeping colonization at bay for a long time.2
Australia therefore appears as a kind of "ideal type" of modern settler
colonialism, a place where Indigenous resistance was weak, where the
complexities of pre-Enlightenment territoriality were absent, and where
the brutal logic of appropriation could operate on what looked like (but
was not) a clean slate. It was with this Australian history in mind that
Patrick Wolfe first developed his theory of **[settler
colonialism]{.underline}**, largely as a response to a postcolonial
scholarship focused on colonies of exploitation.3 An omnivorous reader
with a probing mind, Wolfe also engaged deeply with the histories of
India, the United States, and Israel, among other sites of colonization.
But his [thinking was **strongly shaped** by the **Australian case** as
the **prototypical instance** of settler colonialism]{.underline}.

The most rigorous of the settler colonial theorists in my opinion, Wolfe
insisted that his subject was not an ideology or a set of ideas but
rather a logic. "Although predicated on land rather than on human
bodies," he writes, "settler colonialism is premised on a cultural logic
of elimination that insistently seeks the removal of indigenous humans
from the land in question."4 [The "**logic of
elimination**"]{.underline} is a basic drive to get rid of the
Indigenous presence by one means or another and to replace it with a new
society. This approach [encompasses **material** as well as **discursive
aspects**]{.underline}; massacre, removal, assimilation, and immigration
are part of its repertoire, and so too are various forms of racism,
legal instruments of dispossession, and historical narratives denying
violence.5 Heavily indebted to Marxism and postcolonial theory, Wolfe
grounded his concept in material considerations: the basic distinction
between settler colonialism and the "ordinary" colonialism of the sort
one finds in nineteenth-century India or Africa is that the latter
depends on the exploitation of native labor while the former had no real
need for the natives' work and only wanted their land.6

Extending [this]{.underline} basic [analysis]{.underline}, Wolfe
[developed a]{.underline} highly suggestive, if somewhat
**[schematic]{.underline}**, [**theory** of race
formation]{.underline}.7 With the United States mainly in mind, he
argued that the racism directed at African Americans and that focused on
Native Americans were different species of exclusion. Whereas the one
had to do with denigrated, unfree labor, the other targeted peoples
whose very existence stood as an obstacle to the expansion of settler
society---it was the racism of work versus the racism of land. Wolfe
pointed to the divergent treatment of African Americans and Indigenous
people where "race mixing" was concerned, arguing that the "one-drop
rule" that treated anyone with the slightest African ancestry as black
reflected the colonizer's concern to maximize the laboring population,
whereas the tendency to assimilate people of European and Indigenous
ancestry to the white category (particularly characteristic of
Australian practice) stemmed from an impulse to reduce and eliminate the
Native population.

[All very well where the **nineteenth century** is concerned, but
readers]{.underline} of the Quarterly [may **legitimately ask** whether
[the concept of settler colonialism]{.mark} helps us to understand North
America **prior to the late eighteenth century**. Or is]{.underline}
Wolfe's framework stuck in the modern? Is [it]{.underline} indeed [a
**theory of modernity**]{.underline}? Wolfe did have much to say on
early America and settler colonialism, but insightful though his
writings on that subject are, they are quite different from the
reflections he derived from the Australian case. The [materialism has
**faded**, replaced by a **preoccupation with colonialist doctrines**
and **discourses**]{.underline}. He emphasized an imperialist legal
notion, the "doctrine of discovery," whereby European monarchies
supposedly asserted both sovereignty and dominium from the moment of
contact, reducing Indigenous peoples to mere occupants of the land.
[This]{.underline} he saw as the basis for a future physical
dispossession and replacement by settlers.8 On this point, Wolfe seems
to be swallowing the historical fable promulgated in the 1820s by Chief
Justice John Marshall to justify Indian removal and other legal
techniques of dispossession. Marshall notoriously propounded the view
that "discovery" was tantamount to conquest and that the United States
had inherited Britain's claim not only to rule but also to own vast
portions of the continent.9 Wolfe took this breathtaking distortion of
the colonial past as a description of early modern colonization rather
than as a more modern ideological justification for contemporary
practices of dispossession. More generally, he [tended to [**exaggerate
the importance** and **misconstrue the thrust** of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} arrogant [[pronouncements
of]{.underline}]{.mark} sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
[[**imperialists**, reading into their vague territorial pretensions a
**real program** for replacing Natives with settlers]{.mark}. Apart from
the fact that [colonial charters and other]{.mark} early [assertions of
sovereignty were **more likely** to suggest]{.mark} the
[**incorporation** than]{.mark} the **[elimination]{.mark}** of
Indigenous peoples, these **expressions of imperialist chutzpah cannot
be taken as guides** to what **actually happened**]{.underline}, any
more than the Epistles of Saint Paul can explain the Crusades.

In Wolfe's wake, [a **whole school of settler colonial history** has
arisen with the aim of **reexamining world history** through this
lens]{.underline}. This intellectual movement has spawned many valuable
studies of modern colonialism, notably in applying the concept to the
case of Israel as well as to numerous other nineteenth- and
twentieth-century contexts. [Insofar as **more remote periods** are
concerned]{.underline}, however, [results have been **less
impressive**]{.underline}. A recently published handbook attempts to sum
up the history of settler colonialism over the millennia and around the
world through an array of essays on topics ranging from ancient empires
to present-day New Caledonia.10 Readers of the volume learn about the
Portuguese settlement of the islands of Madeira and the Azores (where
there were no indigenous populations to eliminate) and about Roman
colonia, which reinforced Roman presence on the edges of their
multiethnic empire but which only pushed aside natives from small
enclaves. Some of the premodern cases show affinities to settler
colonialism à la Wolfe, but the contributors generally conclude that
[[the fit is **partial at best**]{.mark}. The scholarship on display is
very good but in most cases **fairly conventional**]{.underline} in
approach, [and [it is **hard to see what value settler colonial theory
adds**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this volume and in other programmatic
publications, [[definitions]{.mark} of settler colonialism [are]{.mark}
rather **[amorphous]{.mark}**, generally
**[lacking]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[theoretical
bite]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Wolfe's early writings.

In my own field, [attempts to reconceive]{.underline} New France's
[history on a settler colonial basis have led to **lamentable
results**]{.underline}. Emboldened by theory and unencumbered by
substantial knowledge of the topic, Edward Cavanagh argues that early
New France needs to be understood as a "corporate" colony founded on
[the principle of [terra nullius]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 That legal
notion had long served as a justification for the colonization of
Australia, so why not New France? Aware of, but undeterred by, Lauren
Benton and Benjamin Straumann's demonstration that this phrase [[was
**unheard of** before the nineteenth century]{.underline}]{.mark},
Cavanagh constructs a new, ad hoc definition of [the term]{.underline}
by which it [comes to stand for]{.underline} a failure to recognize
"Aboriginal title" (which is actually a twentieth-century concept)
linked to [a willingness to **settle land without purchase** or
**cession**]{.underline}. "The practice of terra nullius---whereby
settlers acquire title, improve, and alienate, in a colonized region
where no purchases, cessions, or conquests take place---was prevalent in
New France."12 In fact, [[the French **never maintained** that North
America was **empty**]{.mark}; **to the contrary**, [their
program]{.mark} of colonization [was **all about incorporating
Indigenous nations**]{.mark} into their empire. [In New France, as in
New Spain, officials]{.mark} **repeatedly [proclaimed Indigenous lands
inviolable]{.mark}**[, and the]{.mark} **layered [land tenures]{.mark}**
[of Canada **left**]{.mark} **considerable [room]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
settler-Indigenous [coexistence]{.mark}]{.underline}. That said, [French
settlers did indeed **dispossess** and **displace** Natives]{.underline}
(if not on a large scale, given the demographics); [however, purchases
and cessions are **neither here nor there**. The practice of purchase
and cession]{.underline}, initiated in some of the English colonies in
the seventeenth century and later enshrined in the Royal Proclamation of
1763, was an instrument of unusually thoroughgoing dispossession.13 It
[was a **quintessential settler colonial technique** for utterly
eliminating Indigenous property, and so the fact that the French took a
**less absolutist approach** makes a **poor justification** for equating
them with the colonizers of Australia]{.underline}.

[**Unarguably**, [there are **places** and **periods**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the early modern history of [North America [where the
"**logic of elimination**" was **operative**]{.mark} in both its
material and its discursive aspects]{.underline}, where Natives were
massacred and pushed aside to make way for colonists who proclaimed the
land rightfully and exclusively theirs. For readers of this journal, it
is hardly necessary to enumerate the sites along the Atlantic coast
where colonists displaced Indigenous peoples and established
jurisdictions, sovereignties, and property regimes for themselves, for
the basic outlines of this story of appropriation and dispossession have
long been familiar to historians. [[It is **not**]{.mark} **entirely
[clear]{.mark}** [that labeling it]{.mark} an instance of [settler
colonialism **adds much**]{.mark} to our understanding of the
phenomenon]{.underline}. More importantly, [it is **not obvious** that
settler colonial studies have **much to contribute** to the
study]{.underline}---central to current work in the field---[of the
**broader**, **continental context** in which North American colonies
took shape.]{.underline}

[[The European invasion]{.mark} of America [was **extensive** and
**variegated**; settler colonies were **but one dimension**]{.mark} of
the larger process [and, until the nineteenth century, **not the most
spatially significant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. North of New Spain and
east of the narrow English and French settlements lay [[the **vast
bulk**]{.mark} of]{.underline} the North American continent, [Indigenous
country]{.underline} that [[was neither **conquered** nor
**colonized**]{.mark}. Yet [even in the **absence of the eliminationist
workings**]{.mark} of settler colonialism, [it was **strongly
affected**]{.mark} by the European presence, **more so in some periods**
and **regions** than in **others**. Consider]{.underline}, for example,
the large southeastern region often referred to as [the "**shatter
zone**," where waves of violence and disease succeeded one
another]{.underline}, beginning with Hernando de Soto's entrada of
1539--42 and continuing through successive slave raids and the rise of
militaristic coalescent societies that Robbie Ethridge and others have
tracked.14 [**[Trade]{.mark}** with South Carolina]{.underline},
especially of guns for slaves, [[was the **main driver**]{.mark} of this
destructive upheaval]{.underline}, and so, of course, colonization was
centrally implicated. [Something **generally similar** was occurring in
the southwestern borderlands due to the presence of the colony of New
Mexico]{.underline}.15 [[Only in a **settler national narrative** of the
**most providentialist sort** could]{.mark} the emergence of these
[regional shatter zones be seen as **simply**]{.mark} **paving the way
for [settlement]{.mark}** and **colonization**]{.underline}.

Further north, [[the Great Lakes region]{.mark} was **similarly shaken**
by more than a century of wars and migrations]{.underline} following
Haudenosaunee and French intrusions that started in the 1660s. This was
a site where [[**French**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} later
[**[British]{.mark}**, [intruders]{.mark} played a **transformative
role**]{.underline} through trade, religious evangelism, diplomatic
negotiation, sex, and war. [They [**did not conquer** or
**rule**---and]{.mark} they **certainly [did not
settle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, except in the tiniest
enclaves---[[but]{.mark} they [did]{.mark} **exert influence** and
**[claim imperial sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 [[Coming to
terms with]{.mark} **French [sovereignty claims]{.mark}**]{.underline}
to the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi [[requires]{.mark} us to
recognize [a **more complex**]{.mark}, **less fully territorialized**
and **exclusive [concept]{.mark}** [of political
authority]{.mark}]{.underline} than the modern definition that dominates
Wolfe's thinking on the subject. French **[[imperial
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** here [[was]{.mark} a matter of
[**infiltration** rather than **full takeover**]{.mark}]{.underline};
certainly [[it **had nothing to do with eliminating the Native**, for it
was **entirely**]{.mark} **[dependent]{.mark}** upon that Indigenous
presence]{.underline}. As was the case in the Southeast, there was a
colony in the picture, in this case French Canada on the Saint Lawrence
River, the source of commercial supplies, missionaries, coureurs de
bois, and military officers. The whole pays d'en haut phenomenon was
unimaginable in the absence of this European settlement (and vice
versa). Consequently, [it would be **problematic to isolate the
colonized colonies** from the interior zones of influence and **subject
them to analysis** as instances of **settler colonialism**]{.underline}.
Canada and the pays d'en haut were inextricably connected. In this
respect, New France was exceptional only in the scale of its imperial
hinterland. [All across the]{.underline} trans-Appalachian
[interior]{.underline} in the eighteenth century, [[Indigenous
territories were affected]{.mark} by direct and indirect Euro-American
infiltration, **[without]{.mark} conquest** or **real
[colonization]{.mark}**. [Settler colonial theory **seems ill-equipped**
to deal with the **complexities**]{.mark} of these]{.underline}
commercial/[**imperial incursions** except as a **prelude to
settlement**]{.underline}.

[To **take full account** of]{.underline} the larger continental field
and the upheavals occasioned by [European intrusion, [we need to think
about **empires** as well as **settler colonies**]{.mark}---or rather we
need to [**consider settler colonialism** as an **aspect of**]{.mark}
**early modern [imperialism]{.mark}**. Recent work on the history of
empires underscores the **wide variety of spatial practices** employed
in the creation of overseas empires]{.underline} in the early modern
period, the nodes and networks, the reliance on sea-lanes and interior
waterways to extend power and extract wealth.17 [[Colonial settlements
were **one element** of a **broader pattern of imperial
expansion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially prominent in the British
American Empire. [[Settler colonial theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, valid
and useful though it may be in certain settings, [has the effect of
**[isolating]{.mark} processes of [colonization]{.mark}** [from **larger
processes of imperial penetration**]{.mark}. It also has the effect of
**[flattening]{.mark} long-term historical [change]{.mark}** by
assimilating early modern colonialism to patterns of settlement and
dispossession more characteristic of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}.

That said, let me acknowledge one of the important contributions of
settler colonial theory to the practice of history. Regardless of the
period we study, historians inhabit the modern world (call it postmodern
if you prefer; it makes no difference to the present point), and many of
us are **[[non-Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}** residents of settler
colonial countries. Since, as Patrick Wolfe never tired of repeating,
settler colonialism is "a structure not an event," we are the
beneficiaries of eliminationist practices that continue to victimize
Native peoples.18 As citizens and as
**[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we [[should be **mindful
of**]{.mark} **our subject [positionality]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this
respect. And surely [that [means **scrutinizing the past for
differences**]{.mark} and **transformations**, [not for **pieces of
evidence taken out of context** to suggest an **eternal**]{.mark}
**always-already [condition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Harris---Arms Focus Good

#### The development of [imperial weaponry]{.underline} explains the mechanisms of settler dispossession [better]{.underline}---debate should focus on those technical details. Err aff---even if we're wrong, you [can't determine that]{.underline} with their \[[ontological/pedagogical/etc]{.mark}\] lens without [contextualizing]{.underline} it via the [burden of rejoinder]{.underline}.

**Harris, 4**---Department of Geography, University of British Columbia
(Cole, "How Did Colonialism Dispossess? Comments from an Edge of
Empire," Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94:1,
165-182, dml)

[The emphasis on culture in studies of colonialism tends to **obscure**
other forms of colonial power while making it **impossible to
contextualize** the cultural argument and **assess its salience**.
[Rather than]{.mark} focusing on]{.underline} texts, [[**systems of
signification**, and **procedures of knowledge**]{.mark}
**generation**]{.underline}, as the colonial discourse literature is
wont to do, [a [**fuller understanding** of colonial powers is]{.mark}
achieved by **[explaining]{.mark} colonialism's [basic geographical
dispossessions]{.mark}** of the colonized. In so doing, the issue of
[power is **not prejudged** and]{.mark} the [**particular roles** of
different modes and theories]{.mark} of colonial power [come into
focus]{.mark}]{.underline}. I explore these propositions by considering
the powers underlying the reserve (reservation) system in British
Columbia, a system that, by allocating a tiny fraction of the land to
native people and opening the rest for development, facilitated the
geographical reorganization of the province. My conclusions are these:
[the **initial ability** to dispossess rested **primarily on physical
power** and the **supporting infrastructure** of the state]{.underline};
the momentum to dispossess derived from the interest of capital in
profit and of settlers in forging new livelihoods; the legitimation of
and moral justification for dispossession lay in a cultural discourse
that located civilization and savagery and identified the land uses
associated with each; and the management of dispossession rested with a
set of disciplinary technologies of which maps, numbers, law, and the
geography of resettlement itself were the most important. Although
**[[no one]{.mark} body of [theory explains colonial
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, several theoretical perspectives yield
crucial insights. Key Words: colonialism, colonial discourse theory,
deterritorialization, colonial land policies, governmentality,
reservations, British Columbia. [Influenced by]{.underline} Michel
Foucault's analysis of the relationships of power and knowledge (1972),
by Edward Said's examination of Orientalism (1978), by [**textual
theory** harnessed to **colonial discourse analysis**, and by many
studies of the **values** and **ideologies** enmeshed in particular
colonial encounters]{.underline}, most postcolonial [scholars now
identify]{.underline} culture and associated [**procedures of knowledge
generation** as the **dominant power relations** associated with
colonialism. Whereas]{.underline} Frantz **[Fanon]{.underline}** (1963)
[emphasized **violence**---the **power of the gun**]{.underline}---and
Marx, to the extent that he wrote on colonialism, the aggressive reach
of capital, [postcolonial research]{.underline} and writing [situates
the momentum of colonialism in the **culture** of imperialists and
colonists. A **central goal**]{.underline}, therefore, of colonial
discourse theory [is to identify the **assumptions** and
**representations** inherent in colonial culture---in the
**binary**]{.underline} of civilization/savagery, [in the **erasures of
Aboriginal knowledge of time** and **space**, in **assumptions about
race** and **gender**, in the **concept of the land as
empty**]{.underline} (terra nullius), [and so on---and
then]{.underline}, insofar as possible, [to **expose their contemporary
manifestations**. This]{.underline} work [has **focused much scholarly
energy**]{.underline} and has yielded important theoretical and
practical results, [but it is **[less clear]{.mark}** that it has
**[revealed]{.mark} the [principal momentum]{.mark}** [and **power
relations**]{.mark} inherent in colonialism]{.underline}. Originating in
literary and cultural studies, colonial discourse theory, indeed
postcolonial [scholarship]{.underline} generally, [[privileges]{.mark}
the **investigation of imperial [texts]{.mark}**[, **enunciations**,
and]{.mark} **systems of [signification]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In so
doing, it exposes implicit modes of seeing and of understanding that are
held to infuse and validate colonialism while imparting much of its
momentum. If Said offered broadly inclusive descriptions of colonial
culture, and if others, more recently, have emphasized the variety of
colonial voices and the importance of a local, contextual appreciation
of different colonial cultures (e.g., Thomas 1994), in either case,
[culture is treated as a **primary locus** of colonial
power]{.underline}. Moreover, [as elements of colonial culture are
assumed to have outlived formal colonial regimes, their
**identification** becomes an **active political
project**]{.underline}---the decolonization of representation (Hall
2000, 5). [In itself, this is commendable enough, but if studies of
colonial culture are **not contextualized** among other forms of
colonial power, then it is **well nigh impossible to assess the
particular work** and the **relative salience** of colonial culture
itself]{.underline}. A study of travel writing, for example, may yield
an appreciation of the inflected seeing of travelers and of the
complicity of such seeing with colonial projects, while not beginning to
address the relative importance of travelers' seeing and writing in the
whole colonial enterprise. Given its focus, it cannot. At best, it can
yield a nuanced understanding of traveler perceptions and values, and
suggestive ideas about their relationships with colonialism.
Colonialism's complexity may be affirmed, so too, perhaps, the
discursive construction of reality comments tied more closely to theory
than to a situated knowledge of colonial practices and power relations.
In the hands of some of its most able practitioners, postcolonial
scholarship is a potent means of exploring the reworking
(''provincializing'') of European thought at and for the margins of
empire (Chakrabarty 2000, 16). However, [most [postcolonial
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} is written out of British or American
universities and emanates from the heart of a recently superceded empire
or of a recently ascendant one that hesitates to acknowledge its own
imperial background. American postcolonial scholarship is not
preoccupied with America (Hulme 1995; Thomas 1994 172--73). In the
background of such scholarship are European theorists, particularly
Foucault, Derrida, and Gramsci; in the foreground, European colonial
thought and culture. In these circumstances, as many have pointed out,
it tends to be Eurocentric---or as the Australian anthropologist Patrick
Wolfe puts it, occidocentric (1999, 1). So positioned, it [is well
placed to [comment on the **imperial mind**]{.mark} in its **large
diversity**, and even]{.underline}---especially in the hands of scholars
like Homi Bhabha and Dipesh Chakrabarty who grew up in former
colonies---[on the ways in which European thought has been **inflected**
and **hybridized** by its colonial encounters, [but **not** on]{.mark}
the [**diverse**, **on-the-ground workings** of colonialism]{.mark} in
colonized spaces [around the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. A central claim
of the distinguished Indian subaltern historian, Ranajit Guha, is that
if British historical writing on the subcontinent reveals something of
Britain and the Raj, it reveals nothing of India (1997). Somewhat
similar criticisms have been made of much of [the]{.underline}
postcolonial [literature]{.underline}: that it (or parts of it)
anticipates a radically restructured European historiography, that it
[[allows for **nothing outside**]{.mark} **the ([European)
discourse]{.mark}** of colonialism]{.underline}, that [it is **yet
[another]{.mark} exercise in [metatheory]{.mark}** and [in]{.mark}
**European [universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Slemon 1994;
McClintock 1994). As the literary theorist Benita Parry puts it, the
postcolonial emphasis on language and texts tends to offer ''the World
according to the Word'' (1997, 12)---and the word tends to be European.
But [unless it can be shown [that colonialism is **entirely constituted
by European**]{.mark} **colonial [culture]{.mark}** (a proposition for
[which]{.mark} it [is **hard to imagine any**]{.mark} **convincing
[evidence]{.mark}** [unless]{.mark} the concept of culture is
[**understood so broadly** that it **loses any analytical
value**]{.mark}), then studies of colonial discourse, written from the
center, must be a **very partial window** on the workings of
colonialism]{.underline}. The discipline of geography has responded to
postcolonial thought in a variety of ways (Clayton 2003). Among others,
studies of colonialism itself have come into vogue, most of them written
in Britain, a few from the edges of empire. I am struck by how much the
character of these studies has been influenced by the locations of their
authors. Consider, for example, two recent books by historical
geographers: Felix Driver's Geography Militant: Cultures of Exploration
and Empire (2000), and Frank Tough's ''As Their Natural Resources
Fail'': Native Peoples and the Economic History of Northern Manitoba,
1870--1930 (1996). From opposite perspectives, they treat a fairly
similar period of British colonialism. Driver analyzes the culture of
exploration, particularly the sites and nature of its production and
consumption---as at the Royal Geographical Society. His is a study of
the ways in which the British imperial mind, both popular and academic,
processed explorers' information. Tough's work is embedded in the
materiality of a declining fur trade in the northern Manitoba bush. It
deals with forts and trade routes; with economies and survival
strategies as a twohundred-year-old system of commercial capital vacated
the region; and with native livelihoods found in a precarious balance
between what remained of a hunting, fishing, and gathering economy and
intermittent employment in uncertain industrial resource economies. Each
is an authentic study, yet they have little to say to each other, and
this is basically, I think, because one is written from London, the
heart of an empire, and the other from the Canadian Shield, one of its
many colonial margins. At least, as Derek Gregory has put it, ''what
seemed plausible in the lecture hall of the Royal Geographical Society
in London . . . might well become a half truth on the ground'' (1998,
21). The distinction, perhaps, is between studies of imperialism and of
colonialism: imperialism ideologically driven from the center and
susceptible to conceptual analysis, colonialism a set of activities on
the periphery that are revealed as practice (Young 2001, 16--17). Only a
few geographers have tried to bring both the imperial mind and the
particularities of local colonial circumstances into focus (e.g.,
Clayton 2000 and Lester 2001). But [if the aim is [to understand
**colonialism**]{.mark} rather than the workings of the **imperial
mind**, then it would seem **es[sential]{.mark}** [to
investigate]{.mark} the sites [where]{.mark} colonialism was **actually
[practiced]{.mark}**. Its [effects were **displayed**]{.mark} there. The
[**strategies** and **tactics**]{.mark} on which it relied [were
**actualized** there]{.mark}. There, [in the **detail of colonial
dispossessions** and **repossessions**]{.mark}, the **relative
[weight]{.mark}** [of different agents]{.mark} of colonial power may
**[begin to be assessed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If
[colonialism]{.underline} is the object of investigation, then Tough's
sparse Canadian Shield is promising terrain. It [**was not detached**
from London]{.underline}, of course, [and may have been **profoundly
influenced by elements of imperial thought** and **culture**, but the
extent of this influence **cannot be ascertained in
London**]{.underline}. Rather, I think, [[one needs to **study the
colonial site itself**, **assess the displacements**]{.mark} that took
place there, and **seek to account for them**. To do so is to position
studies of colonialism [in the **actuality** and **materiality**]{.mark}
of colonial experience. As that experience comes into [focus, its
**principal causes**]{.mark} are to be assessed, among [which **may well
be**]{.mark}]{.underline} something like the culture of
[[**imperialism**. To **proceed the other way**]{.mark} **around** is to
**[impose]{.mark} a form of [intellectual imperialism]{.mark}** on the
study of colonialism]{.underline}, a tendency to which the postcolonial
literature inclines. The experienced materiality of colonialism is
grounded, as many have noted, in dispossessions and repossessions of
land. Even Edward Said (for all his emphasis on literary texts)
described the essence of colonialism this way: ''Underlying social space
are territories, land, geographical domains, the actual geographical
underpinnings of the imperial, and also the cultural contest. To think
about distant places, to colonize them, to populate or depopulate them:
all of this occurs on, about, or because of land. The actual
geographical possession of land is what empire in the final analysis is
all about'' (1994, 78). Frantz Fanon held that colonialism created a
world ''divided into compartments,'' a ''narrow world strewn with
prohibitions,'' a ''world without spaciousness.'' He maintained that a
close examination of ''this system of compartments'' would ''reveal the
lines of force it implies.'' Moreover, ''this approach to the colonial
world, its ordering and its geographical layout will allow us to mark
out the lines on which a decolonized society will be reorganized''
(1963, 37--40). Along the edge of empire that was early-modern British
Columbia, colonialism's''geographical layout'' was primarily expressed
in a reserve (reservation) system that allocated a small portion of the
land to native people and opened the rest for development. Native people
were in the way, their land was coveted, and settlers took it. The line
between the reserves and the rest---between the land set aside for the
people who had lived there from time immemorial and land made available
in various tenures to immigrants--- became the primary line on the map
of British Columbia. Eventually, there were approximately 1,500 small
reserves, slightly more than a third of 1 percent of the land of the
province. Native people had been placed in compartments by an aggressive
settler society that, like others of its kind, was far more interested
in native land than in the surplus value of native labor (Wolfe 1999,
1--3). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the scale of dispossession. [At these
sites of colonial dispossession, it seems **particularly fruitful** to
ask **by what means** it came about]{.underline}. The common emphasis in
the colonial discourse literature is reversed. [By **starting not with
texts**, **language**, and **strategies of representation**, but with
the **dispossession of colonized peoples** of their land]{.underline}---
with, as it were, Figures 1 and 2---[the **relative weight** of
different colonial powers is **not prejudged**, and the question becomes
simply: **how was colonial power deployed** to achieve this geographical
effect? Rather than **writing from the imperial center**, rather than
investigating colonial subtexts within a **particular category of
texts**, the analysis turns on the **primary effect** of a **particular
settler colonialism** and on the **gamut of colonial powers** that
facilitated it. So situated, the **[distinctive roles of]{.mark}
different [components of the colonial arsenal]{.mark}** should begin to
**[come into focus]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including maps like Figures 1
and 2). [The [cultural discourse]{.mark} of colonialism should
[begin]{.mark} to be [**contextualized**, and]{.mark} **some
[basis]{.mark} should be [established]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
**[evaluation of salience]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, different
theoretical points of attachment should come into focus, and it should
be possible to sketch the work that particular bodies of theory
accomplish. This article is a rather schematic attempt to undertake such
an analysis and, on that basis, to offer some preliminary conclusions.
In a recent book on the reserve system in British Columbia (Harris
2002), I provide more texture for those who wish it. Yet the very
starkness of an article that surveys an array of colonial powers may
serve to emphasize my argument and encourage the discussion of the
relationships among different forms of colonial power--- and of
different ways of theorizing them---out of which, I think, a more
balanced geographical contribution to the study of colonialism is likely
to emerge. I deal with British Columbia while assuming that my arguments
bear, to some fair extent, on other theaters of settler colonialism. The
Power to Dispassess The problem of reserves in British Columbia arose
with the establishment of colonies and settlers some 70 years after
people of European background began to frequent its coastal waters.
After commercial capital reached the coast in the 1780s and 1790s, and
the interior in the first decade of the 19th century, trade became the
basis of the relationship between natives and nonnatives. The
relationship was frequently mediated by violence, sexual liaisons of
various sorts, and cross-cultural borrowing, but land was not at issue.
Except for the few acres within their palisaded forts and, in some
cases, a little land beyond for a farm or two, traders did not need it.
For their purposes, it was sufficient to insert a handful of outsiders
in ships or forts into native space. But a territory had become known to
the outside world, and its outline had been mapped. In French
sociologist Bruno Latour's terms, such ''inscriptions'' were transported
to distant ''centers of calculation'' (1987, ch. 6). Sketchy information
about a distant corner of North America was processed, thousands of
miles from its source, within complex calculuses of diplomatic ambition,
ideology, cultural stereotypes, and raw geopolitical power (Clayton
2000). Spain relinquished any claim to sovereignty along the north
Pacific coast in 1795. Britain and the United States contended much
longer, an intricate diplomacy at times verging onwar thatwas settled
only in 1846 when the border between British North America and the
United States was extended along the 49th parallel to the Pacific. This
agreement, the Oregon Treaty, was a legal understanding between distant
governments ''respecting the sovereignty and government of the territory
on the northwest coast of America.'' It did not mention native people.
In the eyes of the governments involved, the issue of sovereignty was
settled. Three years later, in response to the American settlement of
Oregon and the news of gold in California, the British government
established the proprietary colony of Vancouver Island. Then, in 1858,
following a rush of underemployed miners from California to the Fraser
River, it established the crown colony of British Columbia. As Daniel
Clayton puts it, ''native space was reproduced as an absolute space of
British sovereignty,'' (2000, 236) although initially, in the aftermath
of the Treaty of Waitangi and judicial rulings in New Zealand, officials
in the Colonial Office were uncertain about the extent to which British
sovereignty in these colonies was burdened by native title (Harris 2002,
15--16). With the creation of these two colonies, land was framed in a
new problematic. Colonies entailed settlers, and settlers required land,
which could be got only by dispossessing native people. A relationship
based on trade was replaced by one based on land. As their land was
taken away, native people had to be put somewhere. A solution with many
precedents in other settler colonies was to put them on reserves.
Dispossession began in the 1850s and continued through the rest of the
century. Physical violence, the imperial state, colonial culture, and
self-interest all underlay it. Violence. The establishment of colonies
on Vancouver Island and the mainland changed the nature of violence
there. It had long accompanied the fur trades. Coastal trading ships
bristled with arms, greed was rampant on both sides, cross-cultural
misunderstandings were frequent, and killing was the common result
(Clayton 2000, ch. 6; Gibson 1992, 163, 170). In the interior, an axiom
of the land-based fur trade was that perceived assaults on the personnel
or property of the traders would be met with quick, spectacular displays
of violence---sovereign power in the Foucaultian sense, though without a
validating regime of rights (Harris 1997, ch. 2). Nor was the gold rush
peaceable. Miners arrived with the latest weaponry (including
six-shooters and spiral-bored rifles) and tactics of Indian fighting
worked out in the American southwest. At the first sign of trouble, they
organized themselves into companies, elected officers, and advanced in
paramilitary formation. But with the creation of settler colonies, a new
level of organization and calculation---the British military---was built
into the equation of violence (Gough 1984). British warships operated
along the coast; a detachment of Royal Engineers was sent out to survey
land and maintain order. Such power was more often displayed than
used---a few quick and very public hangings of suspected murderers after
summary trials on the quarterdeck of one of Her Majesty's warships, or a
few villages shelled and destroyed---spectacles intended to instill
fear. Officials considered such power ''a grand persuasive.'' Some held
that it saved lives by preventing settler--native wars. Frequently, they
judged it sufficient to anchor a warship just off a native village and
ostentatiously prepare the guns. In the interior, the space beyond the
reach of a ship's guns, the military equation was more balanced. In the
1870s, as settlers were moving in and preempting land, many natives
leaders talked of war. Settlers feared, perhaps with justification, that
a native uprising could wipe all of them out in a single night. But, as
the chiefs knew, a shortterm victory was one thing; keeping at bay
settlers and the armies that, sooner or later, would back them up was
quite another. The results of wars across the border in which native
warriors (some from British Columbia) had fought federal U.S. troops,
was evidence in hand. Those who counseled war did so out of desperation.
One chief put it this way: ''A war with the white man will end in our
destruction, but death in war is not so bad as death by starvation''
(cited in Harris 2002, 206). Overall, the balance of physical power lay
overwhelmingly with the state. The imperial state. From the vantage
point of London, Vancouver Island and British Columbia were two remote
and relatively inconsequential colonies. Imperial attention focused,
rather, on India and Ireland. After the advent of free trade in 1846,
the role of settler colonies in the imperial scheme of things had become
increasingly murky. Earl Grey, secretary of state for the colonies when
the colony of Vancouver Island was created, held that colonies returned
important image value for a great power and also that the honor of the
crown required it to protect British settlers overseas (who had chosen
to settle within the British empire) and also to protect native people
from settlers who, left to their own devices, would probably exterminate
them (Grey 1853, vol. 1, letter 1). Yet the coffers of the Lords of the
Treasury opened reluctantly for honor, and British settler colonies
around the world were expected to support themselves. Moreover, the duty
of the crown to protect native people from settlers conflicted with the
Colonial Office's growing willingness to accord responsible government.
As liberal humanitarian sentiments about the essential oneness of human
kind and the opportunity to create a world of civilized, Christian
people faded, responsible government came to dominate protection in
Colonial Office thought (Metcalf 1996; Porter 1999). In settler
colonies, where access to land was the predominant issue, only a hollow
form of responsible government would exclude land policy from colonial
jurisdiction. In effect, by the late 1840s and 1850s, the Colonial
Office had no clear, consistent native policy. As a result, when the
colony of Vancouver Island was created, it was readily inclined to turn
over the management of native people to the Hudson's Bay Company (which,
it thought, had handled them much better than the Americans) and to rely
on the judgment of the fur trader-cum-governor (George Douglas), who
managed both colonies until his retirement in 1864. Thereafter, land
policies were formulated by local settler politicians. The Colonial
Office hardly interfered, and in 1871 when BritishColumbia became a
Canadian province, land policy, now constitutionally a provincial
responsibility within the Canadian confederation, remained in the hands
of these same politicians. The state created a framework for the ordered
development of a settler society, but did not, itself, provide the
momentum for the development of that society or for the dispossessions
and repossessions of land that accompanied it. When power passed to
local politicians, they reflected the values and interests of their
constituents. Culture. The assumptions about the colonized other
analyzed in the colonial discourse literature were pervasive in early
modern British Columbia. Hardly a white person questioned the
distinction between civilization and savagery or the association of the
former with Europeans and the latter with native people. Nor did they
question the proposition that civilized people knew how to use land
properly and that savages did not. From these assumptions it followed
that until Europeans arrived, most of the land was waste, or, where
native people were obviously using it, that their uses were inadequate.
Nor was there room for alternative understandings of civilized
modernity. Rather, thought about native people focused on a simple
binary: civilization and savagery with little of consequence between.
From this it followed that if native people did not become civilized,
and if, in a changing world, it was no longer possible for them to be
savage, then they would die out, a common prediction in British Columbia
well into the 20th century. These social constructions were assumed, not
debated. They pervaded thought about native people in the Colonial
Office, in political, administrative, legal, and missionary circles in
British Columbia, and in the settler mind. An Indian reserve
commissioner, charged with laying out reserves, said this to a native
audience on Vancouver Island in 1876: Many years ago you were in
darkness killing each other and making slaves was your trade. The Land
was of no value to you. The trees were of no value to you. The Coal was
of no value to you. The white man came he improved the land you can
follow his example---he cuts the trees and pays you to help him. He
takes the coal out of the ground and he pays you to help him---you are
improving fast. The Government protects you, you are rich---You live in
peace and have everything you want. ---(cited in Harris 2002, 108) At
the time, few if any white settlers would have disagreed. There were
arguments about how quickly native people could be assimilated and,
therefore, about how much land should be allocated to them. Some
settlers, biological racists to the core, considered natives utterly
lazy, degenerate, and unredeemable; but a few found much to appreciate
or pity in native lives, were well disposed toward native people nearby,
and now and then supported their pleas for more reserve land. But even
kindness--- tinged by an educated, romantic appreciation of nature and,
therefore, of lives assumed to live close to nature--- was situated
within the assumptions of the civilization/ savage binary. So was
salvage anthropology, which in the influential presence of Franz Boas
reached the coast late in the 19th century, there intent upon recovering
the uncontaminated primitive condition. Boas had little interest in the
native societies around him(which, he thought, were becoming civilized),
except insofar as they supplied informants about earlier, precontact
times. These values had not been invented in British Columbia. As a
considerable literature has shown (e.g., Seed 1995; Hulme and Jordanova
1990; Buckle 1991; Arneil 1996), some of them were as old as the
European connection with the New World and had surfaced in the first
European theorizing about their rights there by the Spanish theologian
Francisco de Vitoria in the 1530s, or by the Dutch legal theorist Hugo
Grotius a century later. They were powerfully and influentially
elaborated by John Locke (\[1690\] 1947, ch. 5) in his labor theory of
property. Locke held that God's gift of land to Adam and his posterity
acquired value only as labor was expended on it, and that labor
justified individual property rights. Those who did not labor on the
land wandered over what Locke called unassisted nature, land that
yielded little and lay in common. This, he thought, was the condition of
America before European settlers arrived. The land was ''a wild common
of Nature,'' the original condition of the world before labor was
expended on land and benefits accrued therefrom. Hence his famous
dictum: ''In the beginning, all the world was America.'' In all the
early settler colonies, ordinary (frequently illiterate)
settlers---people who had never heard of Vitoria, Grotius, or
Locke---held unsophisticated versions of these views. By the mid-19th
century, [these]{.underline} old and pervasive [ideas were]{.underline}
powerfully [reinforced by]{.underline} an increasingly strident
[racism]{.underline} and the achievements of industrial production.
These years were the high water mark of ''scientific'' racism. The ideas
of phrenologists, craniometricians, and polygenesists were in the air,
and after Darwin's The Origin of Species (published in 1859), it could
be argued that, even if humans shared a common origin, there had been
ample time for evolution to take different courses and produce different
peoples. The very achievements of industrial society were the measure,
it seemed, of an evolutionary advantage. The lurid tales of the
massacres of English women and children at Morant Bay in Jamaica, or,
later, at Lucknow and Cawnpore during the Indian Mutiny, confirmed in
many minds the absurdity of treating natives as the equal of whites.
Such judgments reached British Columbia. Even **[[more
important]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I think, as the historian Michael Adas
has pointed out, [was the **growing [technological gulf]{.mark}**
between Europe and the rest of the world [and]{.mark} the **tangible
[measure it provided]{.mark}** of the **disjunction**]{.underline}
between civilization and savagery (Adas 1989). [**European
[weaponry]{.mark}** [and **military**]{.mark} **discipline** had [made
conquest]{.mark} **relatively [easy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Headrick
1981). [Contrasts between Europeans and others **seemed obvious**:
**machine power** versus **animal** or **human power**, **progress**
versus **stagnation**, **science** versus **superstition**. [The **whole
material paraphernalia**]{.mark} of European [modernity was]{.mark} a
**[tangible]{.mark} yardstick of [superiority]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
the **idea of [progress]{.mark}**, conceived [in]{.mark} these
[**material terms**, was **in the air**]{.mark} **as never
before**]{.underline}. Moreover, as the historian Mark Francis has
shown, [[if civilization and progress]{.mark} came to be **[equated with
technology]{.mark}**]{.underline} and material wealth, [[then a]{.mark}
**measurable [standard]{.mark} had been [invented]{.mark}** [that native
people **could not attain**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Francis 1998). [They
could be **mannered**, but they **could not match European
technologies** or **material wealth**. Nor did they have the Europeans'
**growing ability to dominate**]{.underline} nature, another measure of
progress. People who marked the land lightly and lived within the
rhythms of nature were obviously unprogressive and backward. If
civilization were measured in these terms, then native societies must be
savage. For British Columbians of European background, the conclusion
was obvious, and the rhetoric surrounding civilization, savagery, and
unused land awaiting development was pervasive and uncontested.

### Kuokkanen---Consequentialism/FW

#### Decolonizing the academy from within debate is [impossible]{.underline} without taking [responsibility]{.underline} for debate's [dialogical form]{.underline}. [Simply theorizing]{.underline} indigenous perspectives is [not enough]{.underline}---[contextualizing]{.underline} those perspectives to [particular demands]{.underline}, defending their [consequences]{.underline}, and submitting them to [oppositional testing]{.underline} are all [prerequisites]{.underline} to decolonial praxis. 

**Kuokkanen, 10**---Assistant Professor in Political Science and
Aboriginal Studies at the University of Toronto, Sámi (Rauna, "The
Responsibility of the Academy: A Call for Doing Homework," Journal of
Curriculum Theory Vol. 26, Iss. 3, (2010): 61-74, dml)

It is important to note that when we talk about indigenous peoples\'
relationship with their lands, it is not a question of whether an
individual may or may not have a relationship with her or his
environment. Obviously, it is important to distinguish between a
philosophy or a worldview and individual thinking and behaviour which
may not always reflect or comply with the former. Moreover, my intention
here is not to evoke the stereotype of \'ecological Indian\' or any
other variety of the Noble Savage, but to consider how certain aspects
of indigenous life philosophies can inform our rethinking the notion of
[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} and how that [[could be **applied
in**]{.mark} **endeavours** aimed at **[decolonizing]{.mark}** and
**transforming [the]{.mark} hegemonic [academy]{.mark}** characterized
by sanctioned epistemic ignorance]{.underline}. In the context of rapid
corporatization of the academy, [[there is a]{.mark} **pressing
[need]{.mark}** [to **envision alternatives** that **oppose**]{.mark}
**the [destructive agendas]{.mark} affecting all of us**]{.underline}.
The pervasive nature of neoliberal corporate mentality is also reflected
in the (willy-nilly) adoption of its values such as the externalization
of social responsibility by many academics. It seems that the ethos and
values of corporations and consumer culture are increasingly influencing
the academy. In the former, social responsibility is considered a
distortion of business principles (Bakan, 2004, p. 35), whereas in the
latter, \"we are actively prevented from exercising care and living in
ecologically-embedded and responsible ways\" (Plumwood, 2002, p. 16). As
a result, [we have academics, including [many \'**revolutionary
scholars**]{.mark},\' who [**prefer to point fingers** rather
than]{.mark} start **[examin]{.mark}ing [their own roles]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} **espousing [new forms]{.mark} of social
responsibility**]{.underline}. As Grande (2004) contends: In this
context, [[the voices of **indigenous**]{.mark} and **other non-Western
[peoples]{.mark}** [become]{.mark} **increasingly [vital]{.mark}**[, not
because such]{.mark} peoples **categorically [possess]{.mark} any kind
of [magical]{.mark}**, **mystical [power]{.mark}** [to **fix**]{.mark}
**countless generations of [abuse]{.mark}** and **neglect**, [but
because non-Western peoples]{.mark} and nations [exist as **living
critiques**]{.mark} **of the dominant culture**, [providing]{.mark}
**critique-al [knowledge]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **potentially
[transformative paradigms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (p. 65) What is more,
[[elaborating a different logic]{.underline}]{.mark}-that of the
gift-[[**in** and **for**]{.mark} **contemporary [contexts]{.mark}** [is
**different** from]{.mark} the trend of **[evoking]{.mark}** (**often
[undefined]{.mark}**) \'**traditions**\' and **formulating action [plans
grounded on]{.mark} cultural [authenticity]{.mark}**, **nationalism** or
**separatism**. An [**uncritical reinscription** of tradition is
**problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline} for many reasons but particularly
because of the real dangers of further excluding already marginalized
groups such as indigenous women (Green, 2004; LaRocque, 1997). However,
the reality is that contemporary indigenous peoples generally continue
to be culturally, socially, economically and spiritually more directly
dependent on their lands and surrounding natural environments. This
thinking is still a central part of indigenous philosophies while for
many other peoples, this previously existing connection and relationship
with the physical surroundings started to erode generations ago as a
result of modernization, colonization and other developments since the
Renaissance and Enlightenment which continue today in the form of
neocolonialism and patriarchal global capitalism. [In cultures and
societies that **foreground reciprocity**]{.underline}, individuals are
brought up with an understanding and expectation of acting for others.
In other words, [the notion of **responsibility** is an **integral part
of being human** and an **inseparable part of one\'s
identity**]{.underline}. Armstrong (1996), an Okanagan writer and
educator, articulates her identity and thus, her responsibilities, as
follows: I know the mountains, and by birth, the river is my
responsibility: They are part of me. I cannot be separated from my place
or my land. When I introduce myself to my own people in my own language,
I describe these things because it tells them what my responsibilities
are and what my goal is. (p. 461) By recognizing her responsibilities,
Armstrong knows her location and her role in her community; in short,
she knows who she is. This notion of [responsibility stems from a
**perception of interrelatedness** of **all life
forms**]{.underline}-that it is her responsibility to ensure the
well-being of the mountains and river because it is directly related to
her personal as well as to her community\'s well-being. Nuu-chah-nulth
hereditary whaling chief and the founding Chair of the World Council of
Whalers, Happynook (2000), elaborates this understanding as follows:
When we talk about indigenous cultural practices we are in fact talking
about responsibilities that have evolved into unwritten tribal laws over
millennia. These responsibilities and laws are directly tied to nature
and are a product of the slow integration of cultures within their
environment and the ecosystems. Thus, the environment is not a place of
divisions but rather a place of relations, a place where cultural
diversity and bio-diversity are not separate but in fact need each
other. (n.p.)4 In western philosophical tradition, responsibility is
considered a complex concept discussed and theorized by numerous
scholars. Gasché (1995), for example, argues that \"\[t\]here is perhaps
no theme more demanding than that of \'responsibility\'\" (p. 227). A
normative definition in this tradition views responsibility \"as a
mechanical application of a framework of rules that simultaneously
relieves the subject of the onus of decision and, hence, of all
liability\" (Gasché, 1995, p. 227). On the other hand, however,
responsibility implies a responsible response which can take place
\"only if the decision is truly a decision, not a mechanical reaction
to, or an effect of, a determinate cause\" (Gasché, 1995, p. 227).
Gasché (1995) further notes that considering responsibility involves a
number of risks and thus, \"\[a\] responsible discourse on
responsibility can indeed only assert itself in the mode of a
\'perhaps\'\" (p. 228). For Heidegger, responsibility is \"a response to
which one commits oneself\" (as cited in Gasché, 1995, p. 228). This
idea of responsiveness or respondence is further explicated by Spivak
whose notion of responsibility reflects Bakhtin\'s articulation of
\'answerability.\'6 Spivak (1994) proposes that response: involves not
only \'respond to,\' as in \'give an answer to,\' but also the related
situations of \'answering to,\' as in being responsible for a name (this
brings up the question of the relationship between being responsible
for/to ourselves and for/to others); of being answerable\...( p. 22)
[[Responsibility signifies the **act of response** which **completes the
transaction of speaker** and **listener**, as well as the **ethical
stance** of **making discursive space for the \'other\' to
exist**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Spivak, \"[ethics are **not just a
problem of knowledge** but a **call to a relationship**]{.underline}\"
(Spivak, Landry, & Maclean, 1996, p. 5). If responsibility cannot be
merely mechanical expectation to answer, [what does it
mean]{.underline}, then, [[to call for]{.mark} a **willingness to give a
response** and for **[ability to response]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e.,
**[response-ability]{.underline}**)? [Responsibility]{.underline}
necessitates knowledge. It [requires **knowing how to respond** but also
**act in a responsible manner**]{.underline}. Derrida (1992) suggests
that \"[**not knowing**, having neither a **sufficient knowledge** or
**consciousness** of **what being responsible means**, is of itself a
**lack of responsibility**]{.underline}\" (p. 25). If knowledge is a
prerequisite for responsibility, [ignorance presents a **serious
threat** to responsible, response-able behaviour and
thinking]{.underline}. Moreover, **[responsibility demands
action]{.underline}**: If it is true that the concept of [responsibility
has]{.underline}, in the most reliable continuity of its history,
[**always [implied involvement in action]{.mark}**, **doing**, a
**[praxis]{.mark}**, [a **decision that exceeds**]{.mark}]{.underline}
simple conscience or **[simple [theoretical
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it is also true that [the same
concept **[requires a decision]{.mark}** or **responsible action** [to
**answer for itself consciously**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, [wi[th
**knowledge of**]{.mark} **a thematics** of **what is done**, of [**what
action signifies**, its **causes**, **ends**]{.mark}, etc]{.underline}.
(Derrida, 1992, p. 25) Responsibility as action beyond theorizing poses
a possibility of an interruption: \"there is no responsibility without a
dissident and inventive rupture with respect to tradition, authority,
orthodoxy, rule, or doctrine\" (Derrida, 1992, p. 27). Responsibility as
a rupture of tradition may sound at odds with indigenous perceptions and
practices of responsibility which emphasize the continuance of
tradition. However, no tradition is static, remaining unchanged
throughout history, as indigenous people also repeatedly stress,
particularly when confronted by irresponsible demands for authenticity.
There has always been a rupture, both inventive (usually from within)
and intrusive, and interventionist (usually from without).6 In the
context of the academy, responsibility with an inventive rupture
implies, first and foremost, the ability of interrupting the self, of
moving beyond the \'I\' as the ethical subject (Derrida, 1997, p. 52).
Although the academy is prone to list its responsibilities in its lofty
vision statements and to call for the responsibilities of students and
researchers, we frequently witness the unwillingness of the institution
itself to respond, to be answerable and take action. Instead of opening
up toward the other, the representatives who feel implicated become
defensive or remain silent. As Derrida notes in the above quote,
[responsibility links consciousness with conscience]{.underline}. [[It
is **inadequate to merely know one\'s responsibilities**; one **also has
to be conscious** of]{.mark} the **[consequences]{.mark} of one\'s
actions**. Without conscience, there is a risk of the **arrogance** of a
\'**clean conscience**.\']{.underline} Derrida further calls for \"[new
ways of [taking responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}\" in the academy
which are critical of the professionalization of the university
(Derrida, 1983). These new ways [[would signify **rethinking the
university**]{.mark} **institution**, examining its disciplinary
structures and in particular, \"a **new way of educating students** that
will prepare them to **undertake new analyses**\"]{.underline} (Derrida,
1983, p. 16). Moreover, Derrida (1983) notes: New responsibilities
cannot be purely academic. If they remain extremely difficult to assume,
extremely precarious and threatened, it is because they must at once
keep alive the memory of a tradition and make an opening beyond any
program, that is, toward what is called the future. ( p. 16)

### Reed---Reappropriating Sovereignty Good---2AC

#### [Strategic reappropriation]{.underline} of sovereignty is an [essential part]{.underline} of decolonization.

**Reed, 14**---Vassar College (Kaitlin, "We Are Salmon People:
Constructing Yurok Sovereignty in the Klamath Basin,"
<https://digitalwindow.vassar.edu/senior_capstone/304/>, dml)

The problem of the political is also especially relevant in
understanding the construction of Yurok sovereignty broadly, and
resource conflict in the Klamath Basin more specifically. The concept of
[**sovereignty**, when used in an **indigenous context**, "signif\[ies\]
a **multiplicity of legal** and **social rights** to political,
economic, and cultural self-determination"]{.underline} (Barker 1).
[Sovereignty is portrayed by **both American** and **tribal
governments** as the **paved road toward autonomy** and
**self-determination**, a means of **economic prosperity** and the
ability to **enforce rights** over land, water and other
resources]{.underline} (Wilkinson, 2005: xiii). Indeed, [it is **rather
indisputable** that sovereignty, as a **discourse** and **mode of
pressing political claims**, has brought **tangible** and **material
benefits** to tribal communities]{.underline} (Barker 18; Alfred 39).
Yurok sovereignty is utilized as means to protect the Klamath River and
its salmon; as noted above, sovereignty frames the constitution and
exercise of authority, including authority over water.

Often portrayed as a stand-in attempting to represent all indigenous
rights (Barker 1), "[sovereignty as a discourse is unable to capture
fully the indigenous meanings, perspectives, and identities about law,
governance, and culture, and thus over time it impacts how those
epistemologies and perspectives are represented]{.underline}" (19). [The
continual (re)production of sovereignty holds the potential to
**permeate indigenous forms of governance** and thereby change the very
relation indigenous peoples hold with the land. This is particularly
pertinent for indigenous communities because relationships with the land
and resource stewardship are **fundamental components** of an indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline} (Tsosie 1302). Native peoples are tied to the
land in ways Western thinkers often cannot understand (Champagne 7;
Deloria, 1973: 1). The land itself is sacred; Native epistemologies and
worldviews are predicated on an ability to live and care for the land
they occupy (LaDuke, 2005: 189). [And thus, the **ability to protect the
vitality of natural resources** \-- understood as gifts from the Creator
\-- is **paramount** in the assertion of an indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline} (Fenelon 112).

With notions of land in mind, [the **processes of exclusion** and
**drawing boundaries become evident** in discourses of
sovereignty]{.underline}. Indeed,

One of the major problems in the indigenous sovereignty movement is that
its leaders must qualify and rationalize their goals by modifying the
sovereignty concept\...\[which\] itself implies a set of values and
objectives that put it in direct opposition to the values and objectives
found in most traditional indigenous philosophies. (Alfred 43).

Alfred is articulating constructions of epistemological boundaries
wherein indigenous relationships to land and resources are not
adequately represented within discourses of sovereignty. What is at
stake is not only our connection to the land, the very essence of
indigeneity, but the unique tribal identity defining indigenous peoples
since time immemorial. Indeed, [when "sovereignty \[is\] treated as
**unitary**, **pre-formed universals**"]{.underline} (Lindner 13), [it
aims to **standardize hundreds of very diverse groups** of indigenous
people]{.underline}. Alfred argues that "the actual history of our
plural existence has been erased by the narrow fictions of a single
sovereignty" (33). [And thus, it becomes **increasingly important** for
alternative narratives to be shared]{.underline}. The point, therefore,
is that \'Native American\' is not a unified body with a common
governance structures; nor should individual tribes be expected to
conform to structures of Western governance (Tsosie 1307).

[Western constructions of sovereignty, however, **can be** (and **have
been**) **resisted** and **refashioned** by indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. Indeed,

[\'Native sovereignty\' -- is founded on an ideology of **indigenous
nationalism** and a **rejection** of the models of government rooted in
European cultural values. It is an **uneven process** of reinstituting
systems that **promote the goals** and **reinforce the values** of
indigenous cultures]{.underline}, against the constant effort of the
Canadian and United States governments to maintain the systems of
dominance imposed on indigenous communities during the last century.
(Alfred 40)

Indeed, [though the '**colonial stench**' of sovereignty is
**problematic**, that is **not to say it cannot be a useful tool** for
indigenous peoples]{.underline}. Though the colonial term
['sovereignty']{.underline} is "incomplete, inaccurate, and
troubled\...it [has]{.underline}\...[been **rearticulated** to mean
something altogether by indigenous peoples]{.underline}" (Barker 26).
And what that something else means must always be tribally specific.

Essentially, [sovereignty in and of itself is a colonial tool.
But]{.underline} \-- like Native writers\' use of English in
storytelling \-- [can be **reappropriated** to represent another reality
altogether and utilized to reconstruct meaning]{.underline}. Indigenous
scholars have articulated the problematic origins of the term, yet also
the benefits it has brought. Simultaneously, however, [some scholars
**disown the concept** as an appropriate political
objective]{.underline}. And thus, it is helpful to examine Yurok notions
of sovereignty in the context of the political. [The]{.underline}
Yuroks\' **[entrance into a Western political framework]{.underline}**,
however, [**must not be read** as an **abandonment of culture** or
**traditional forms of governance**. Rather, the **construction** and
**assertion of**]{.underline} Yurok [**sovereignty** was in response to
the creation of an **unbalanced society**]{.underline} over the past
century \-- a society that depends upon environmental exploitation to
function. Yurok [sovereignty]{.underline}, therefore, [will be
understood]{.underline} in this context [as a means in which to
**negotiate with larger governing structures**; a means in which to
**legitimize sought after authority**; and]{.underline} ultimately, [one
of the **last remaining options available to protect**]{.underline}
their **[ways of life]{.underline}**. Ironically, [sovereignty will be
**essential** in the **larger decolonization project**]{.underline}
unfolding across the continent.

### Rosenow---Ontology Wrong

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99, dml)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40 But my unease was also emerging from
something else, which is what I want to focus on in this article: the
problem that encounters and conflicts are yet again made sense of within
overarching structures of knowledge production rather than cultivation
(despite the intention to do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes
clear in the quotation above, what is encountered as "different" is
inevitably described "in forms that I could understand" (my
emphasis)---even whilst simultaneously recognising that one's
description does not capture what the encountered practices actually do.
Sense-making, for de la Cadena, takes place at what could be called two
levels: At a first level, there is the inevitable process of making
sense of an alienating affective experience on the spot, from within
one's own framework of understanding the world. At a second level, then,
de la Cadena attempts to make legible her grappling and
not-understanding in the context of a book for an academically literate
and interested audience---in other words, in the writing-up of her
ethnographic research. In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given
that their articles do not aim to make an empirical contribution,
sense-making takes place at what could be called a third level: what is
drawn upon is the understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic
work of others, which is brought into conversation with various bodies
of theoretical work in order to make a conceptual contribution. This
takes place via the coining of central concepts and the outlining of
all-encompassing frameworks that are meant to help us understand the
analytical, normative and political consequences of their argument for
scholarly work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are
used to delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR
and beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place. [This is]{.underline} also [the problem
of some **central decolonial work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard
Glissant, Mignolo, for example, critiques the "requirement of
transparency" that forms the basis for understanding in Western social
science scholarship. He argues for [the "**right to opacity**" of those
located on the **other side of the colonial difference**]{.underline}.41
But this claim sits at odds with his simultaneous desire to write a new,
all-encompassing history of "the modern/colonial world system". 42 And
like in Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's articles, terms such as
"pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44 [are coined in order to have a
(**one!**) concept for a **similarly all-encompassing solution** to
domination]{.underline}. While de la Cadena is critical of her own
"anxiety to understand coherently (with which I meant clearly and
without contradiction"), and while she points out how [this]{.underline}
"was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well as Rojas and Blaney and
Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such [anxiety in **yet another
coherent framework** that **holds everything together**]{.underline}.
The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46 But as I have already indicated in relation to de la
Cadena's work, when writing up their research for academic purposes,
even those who have directly experienced ontological encounters find it
hard to resist the tendency to conclude their work with stringent,
overarching, coherent conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can
grasp and "take home". In the next section, I will draw on two
anthropological ethnographic texts that are significant for research on
the GMO controversy to show how this works. The two texts that will be
analysed in the next section engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay
and Mexico respectively, and they have stood out for me in the way they
manage to convey a sense of unease and grappling with ontological
encounters and conflicts. However, as the next section will show, they
as well end up providing a framework and conclusions that can
accommodate and make sense of the encountered ontological difference. 3.
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy According to Susana
Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research that is carried out
in relation to the question of what smallholder producers in the Global
South truly think of (and say about) agricultural biotechnology is
unable to grasp the "ontological incompatibility" that exists between
the experienced human/nonhuman relations in small-scale agriculture on
the one hand, and the logic that underlies genetic engineering (GE) on
the other.47 This is precisely because most social research is itself
grounded in the crucial modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the
former can only be known through scientific means, while the latter can
be known through the study of social/cultural/political practices.
Knowledge about nature is about establishing "facts", which are either
true or false (i.e. nature as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly
represented), while knowledge about culture is about studying meaning,
which is necessarily (due to the existence of different cultures)
multiple. The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual"
danger consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences,
which therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are
made about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else: Until this point,
I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion with and about
humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was with what Antonio
said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing at the beans, and
I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying that this was a
figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even to claim that
this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly framed 'la soja
mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather than analysis
itself worthy of response.50 However, Hetherington points out that not
believing in the truth of the killer bean did not prevent him from
"participating in Antonio's knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved
in the anti-soy bean activism of the peasants, Hetherington became "part
of the situation" that made the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in
a court case that was brought against two soy farmers for the murder of
two activist peasants. As a result, killer beans became transformed into
a matter of national concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation
involved more than joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief:
it led to him becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and
beans that started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's
words, he indeed became "partially connected": 52 Beans didn't scare me
at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation that gives rise to
killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of soy were a familiar,
even a comforting sight. But it took only a few months with Antonio for
me to start feeling the menace from those fields. Soon, the sweetish
smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and especially the corpselike
smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin my appetite and make me
expect to see people emerge from their homes to show me pustules on
their legs and stomachs.53 Similar observations are also found in
Carro-Ripalda and Astier's contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and
Human Values symposium on the challenges of making smallholder producer
voices being heard in relation to agricultural biotechnology.54 While
most of the contributions to the symposium concentrate on how to tease
out smallholders' "real" voices in the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda
and Astier critically reflect on their own perceived failure to become
knowledgeable about smallholders' voices in their research on GM maize
cultivation in Mexico. It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural
areas in Central Mexico, in-depth structured interviews, focus groups,
participant observation and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City
with over 50 stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the
actual voices of peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55
However, particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create
conditions under which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on
their own terms about GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the
conditions of exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56
The public discourse that centres on questions of safety, science,
possibilities of regulation and problems of potential contamination, and
which is upheld by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists,
dominated the workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised
different concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main
ones, as if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all".
The way that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas,
and desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57 Carro-Ripalda and Astier
are focused on the dominance of one particular (techno-scientific,
regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled smallholder voices
engaged in different discourses from speaking up or, when speaking, from
being heard. In other words, smallholders were unable to adequately
represent their own understanding of what is at stake in the GM maize
controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have pointed out in the
previous section, based on Rojas, difference is thereby transformed into
an epistemological, rather than an ontological one: Carro-Ripalda and
Astier's argument is implicitly based on the assumption that, under the
right conditions, difference can be translated into something that can
be communicated to, and discussed with, other stakeholders. But the term
"ontological incompatibility" that the authors themselves use indicates
there is something else at play, which cannot easily be translated: the
nature of the relation of smallholder producers to their "land, seed,
crop, climate ... as told and understood by themselves"; the "central
place" that Maize continues to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic
cosmology, and "the social and cultural significance" that goes along
with that.58 Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the
dominant discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination
this discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the
Mexican agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to
understand what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is
about. At the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers
whom they have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable:
at stake for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their
lives as maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge,
and their ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access
to their 'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional'
ways of agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort. Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
article is meant to render legible their own encounter of ontological
difference for an academic audience. Is it possible for the reader to
dig below these representational strategies, and to relate more directly
to their encounter of what they themselves call ontological
incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their final workshop,
in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a few places in
the article in which their inability to put into words and arguments all
of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons that bind
people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this complexity
is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62 Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we
felt that that, through our research on the ground, we had engaged with
male and female farmers, heard about their perspectives on GM and their
visions of a rural future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and
markets. So, what do smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What
meanings did they convey to us? We will provide here but a few of those
sounds and meanings ... 63 Despite returning to the idea of voices as
conveying "meaning" in this quote, meaning is related to sounds, to
walking together, to particular places with their own sounds, smells,
and colours. The sample of actual "voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then
choose to present yet again invoke an intricate sense of the
relationality of farmers and nonhumans: It is a joy to plant, getting
hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob which is pleasant, to go to the
harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all regular. Because this is what
sustains me. You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ...
You need to look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the
difference. It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it
\[for replanting the following year\].64 By contrast, GM maize is
associated by the smallholders whom Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with
feelings of "artificiality, estrangement and distrust towards the
created object (the GMO) in itself, not only because of deep ontological
considerations ... but because of the political and economic motives
which are 'assembled' into it."65 Although the authors make a
distinction between ontology and politics/ economics here, their
invoking of the "assemblage" precisely shows how the latter becomes part
of ontology itself, and then (as in the case of Hetherington) impacts on
the sensual, bodily connection with the maize. Understanding the
relation between "things" in this way allows for an analysis of power
and domination that has at least the potential of moving beyond
pre-given frameworks; strategically suspending them in order to "sharpen
\[the\] analysis of exactly how power operates, how relations are made
and undermined, and with what consequences". 66 Genetically modified
maize is a problem because it is part of particular Mexican neoliberal
visions and strategies, but in the context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, that vision is not only (and not even primarily) made sense of
through given frames of knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the
exploitation of labour, but sensually, through the way it disrupts the
(physical) pleasure and joy that has sustained the
farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology externalises the maize
from farmers and estrange them from their ways of life; and it is only
through this externalisation that GM maize becomes perceivable as a
potential source of "contamination", as a danger against which farmers
need to "defend" their seeds.68 Now, some might counter that the
previous paragraph in practice only provides a fancy repackaging of the
two well-rehearsed arguments brought forward by many anti-GMO activists:
(a) that the problem of GMOs is an intrinsic property that makes it
"unsafe" (which activists try to scientifically prove), and/or (b) that
the fundamental problem of agricultural biotechnology is that it
estranges farmers from their traditional, ancestral way of life, that it
allows for their exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold
for neoliberal visions of how the world should be ordered. Both
arguments are grounded in modern ontology: the first goes down the route
of science (contesting "facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis
of science itself), while the second goes down the "social" route by
either making a case for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or
for the need to prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use
of all of these routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and
intellectual Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating
character of the GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time
depicting smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or
indigenous knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity
through their traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, this "unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder
producers as passive, timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely
the sort of romanticised reification of "difference" that I have
critiqued in the previous section of this article---paradoxically, in
this case, on the basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it
regards both "things" and "people" as ontologically stable and
classifiable. By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed
in this section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by
the nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)? This
article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections. 4. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections
on What Questions to Ask The pull of hegemonic systems of academic
knowledge production is difficult to avoid. This is the case even in
writings that are directly based on ontological encounters and
controversies, and that reflect on the displacement that encountering
different ontologies has entailed. But as I have indicated, this problem
is even more pronounced in writings---like my own---that provide what I
have previously called "third-level" sense-making of ontological
encounters. The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a
conceptual one, which makes it by definition veer towards the general
and abstract rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on
decolonial thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in
three different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide
an understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the
former as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo
Viveiros de Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that
ontology can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as
always being "enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an
understanding of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines
reality as "always in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid
assemblages". 73 Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards
answering the question of what reality as such, in general is about.
Secondly, there is an ambition to coin the general normative-political
project that arises out of this understanding with a singular concept,
such as the pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological
multiplicity and the emancipatory-decolonial political projects that
arise out of its recognition are written for an audience of a particular
discipline, such as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general
rethinking, or, indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74 What sort of
questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and what desire "to
know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee philosopher Brian
Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions we choose to ask
are more important than any truths we might hope to discover in asking
such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is always (at least
in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge of the form 'that
something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified by referring to
direct experiences: "there must be something underlying them and
justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77
Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.
Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79 But even for
those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical research, there
is space to push the boundaries of what can and should be written about
(and how). For decades there have been attempts to provide "innovative"
platforms, for example at conferences, to talk about "stuff" in
different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic practices; not at
least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80). However, these
"innovations" are still at the margins, and they will most likely never
be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge production outlets such
as journal articles and scholarly books. But even within the latter,
there is always at least some space to push for more open-endedness,
more reflection on the author's embodied positionality, more
auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even if this is based on
reading about the ontological encounters of others). Although this sort
of embodied self-reflection on a writer's "situatedness" (which in my
own case means being "on the colonising side of a divide"81) has
obviously been advanced by many critical scholars for decades (including
feminists and post- as well as decolonial scholars), this article has
hopefully shown that [there is still (**always**) a **need to go
further**, in order to **more fundamentally challenge hegemonic**,
**modern/colonial modes** of knowledge production]{.underline}. The
sense of unease that I have outlined in section two was particularly
strong when reading conclusions that were geared towards making
recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for "international
politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic conclusions for**
]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**, or [global
"**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

### Weiss---Sovereignty/Futurity Good---2AC

#### Forwarding sovereignty claims in the name of a collective future within debate [iteratively fractures]{.underline} settler colonialism.

**Weiss, 15**---Ph.D. candidate, Anthropology, University of Chicago
(Joseph, "UNSETTLING FUTURES: HAIDA FUTURE-MAKING, POLITICS AND MOBILITY
IN THE SETTLER COLONIAL PRESENT," Dissertation submitted to the Faculty
of the Division of Social Sciences, Department of Anthropology,
University of Chicago, December 2015, 223-232, dml)

At the same time, [there is an **inescapably political
dimension**]{.underline} to the attempt to render Haida Gwaii as the
homeland of a still open Haida future. The assertion of the (located)
openness of the future does not necessarily make it so. As I noted in
the first part of this dissertation, the flow of Haida departures and
returns unfold in the broader context of the settler, capitalist state;
indeed, they are made necessary in part by the current absence of
economic opportunity on island, just as the arrival of potentially
threatening strangers is a result of their privileged position in the
very capitalist economy they seek to escape. [[Constituting futures in
which]{.underline}]{.mark} Haida [[people have the **freedom to engage**
with]{.underline}]{.mark} that economy (and [[settler
society]{.underline}]{.mark} more generally) [[**as they see fit** while
**retaining the capacity to come home**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(complicated as that process might be) also [reiterates the
**inescapability of some form of engagement** with that
socio-economy]{.underline}. Likewise, [the notion of]{.underline} Haida
Gwaii as Haida [homeland [**cannot be separated**
from]{.mark}]{.underline} current Haida **[[struggles to
assert]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [[**rights** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [lands and waters]{.underline} of Haida Gwaii, the
[resources]{.underline} found therein, [and their **[sovereign capacity
to govern]{.mark}**]{.underline} themselves and the islands in the ways
they find appropriate. This is, recall, the very crux of the CHN's own
commitment to the assurance of futurity, as it is only by positioning
itself as the rightful, sovereign government of the Haida Nation and its
homeland of Haida Gwaii that it can adequately care for the islands and
protect them from external threat. And the continuing advance of the
Enbridge project despite fierce opposition from CHN, the Old Massett
Village Council, their Haida constituents, and the non-Haida actors with
whom they are "united against Enbridge" (and this alongside protest all
over the northwest coast) gives the nightmare futures of environmental
collapse -- pushed through by corporate interests and Canadian
politicians - a frightening immanence. The assertion of the openness of
the future is made, in short, in (and against) a context in which
closures remain endemic.

And yet, something has changed in this landscape from the initial
erasures of Native futurity we drew out in the first chapter. In the
narratives of colonial actors like Duncan Campbell Scott, it was
absolutely clear that "Indians" were disappearing because their social
worlds were being superseded by more "civilized" ways of living and
being, ones that these Native subjects would also, inevitably, in the
end, adopt (or failing that, perish outright). There was a future. It
was simply a settler one. But the **[[nightmare
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}** of that my Haida interlocutors ward
against in their own future-making reach beyond Haida life alone.
Environmental collapse, most dramatically, [**[threatens the
sustainability of all life]{.mark}**; toxins in the land and the waters
**threaten human lives [regardless of]{.mark} their [relative
indigeneity]{.mark}**[, **race**, or **gender**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Choy 2011; Crate 2011). Put another way, [the impetus
for]{.underline} non-Haida (and [non-First Nations subjects]{.underline}
more generally) [to be]{.underline} "**[united]{.underline}** against
Enbridge" [with their indigenous neighbours comes]{.underline} in no
small part [because]{.underline} an oil spill also profoundly threatens
the lives and livelihoods of non-Aboriginal coastal residents, a fact
which Masa Takei, among others, made clear in Chapter 3. Nor is the
anxiety that young people might abandon their small town to pursue
economic and educational advantage in an urban context limited to
reserve communities. Instead, the compulsions of capitalist economic
life compel such migrations throughout [the]{.underline} globe. The
[nightmare futures that]{.underline} Haida [people constitute
alternative futures to ward against are **not just future of indigenous
erasure** under settler colonialism. They are **erasures of settler
society itself**.]{.underline}

[[There is]{.mark} thus [an **extraordinary political claim**]{.mark}
embedded in]{.underline} Haida [future-making]{.underline}, a claim
[[which gains its power]{.mark} **precisely
[because]{.mark}**]{.underline} Haida
[[future-making]{.underline}]{.mark} as we have seen it [**[does
not]{.mark}** (perhaps **cannot**) **[escape]{.mark}** from [the
**larger field of settler-colonial determination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Instead, in Haida future-making [we find the **implicit assertion** that
Haida people can make futures that address the dilemmas of **Haida** and
**settler life alike**, ones that can at least
"**navigate**,"]{.underline} to borrow Appadurai's phrasing, [towards
possible futures that **do not end in absolute erasure**]{.underline}.
[If]{.underline} Povinelli and Byrd are correct and [settler liberal
governance **makes itself possible** and **legitimate** through a
**perpetual deferral** of the problems of the present, then part of the
power of]{.underline} Haida [future-making is to **expose the
threatening non-futures** that might emerge out of this bracketed
present]{.underline}, to expose as lie the liberal promise of a good
life always yet to come and to attempt to constitute alternatives.

It is no coincidence that [we find this [in]{.mark} the midst of [a
**struggle over sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And this not just in
the sense of the Council of the Haida Nation's ongoing assertion of its
sovereign right to govern the lands and waters of Haida Gwaii on behalf
of all Haida people, as we saw in Chapter 5. Rather, as Joanne Barker
has argued, over the course of the latter half of the twentieth century
[sovereignty has emerged [as a]{.mark}]{.underline}:

[**particularly [valued term]{.mark}** [within indigenous scholarship
and]{.mark} social [movements]{.mark}]{.underline} and through the media
of cultural production. [It \[is\] a term [around which analyses]{.mark}
of indigenous histories and cultures [were **organized** and]{.mark}
whereby indigenous [activists **articulate** ]{.mark}**their
[agendas]{.mark}** for social change]{.underline} (Barker 2005:18).

[Through [the **assertion of sovereignty**]{.mark}, indigenous political
leaders, activists and scholars **[refute]{.mark}** ["the **dominant
notion**]{.mark} that indigenous people \[are\] merely one among many
'**minority groups**']{.underline} under the administration of state
social service and welfare programs." Instead, "[[sovereignty defines
indigenous people with **concrete rights to self-government**,
**territorial integrity**, and **cultural
autonomy**]{.underline}]{.mark} under international law" (18). The
trouble is, of course, that [indigenous claims to sovereignty are
**always made** within the **context of colonial
nation-states**]{.underline}, ones whose own legitimacy is put at
considerably risk both by the prospect of self-determining indigenous
Nations (re)-emerging within their boundaries and the troubling of their
own historical narratives of sovereign rights (cf: Comaroff and Comaroff
2003b). (One of these narratives, which reinterpreted indigenous lands
as terra nullius and thus open to occupation, we've encountered already
in Chapter 3). Thus, while sovereignty might indeed "define" indigenous
peoples with concrete rights to territorial Title and
self-determination, in theory equal under international law to the
states who also lay claim to their territories, that definition does not
in and of itself make possible the practice of this sovereignty. In this
regard settler states such as Canada have shifted in their response to
First Peoples' sovereignty claims from outright rejection to a set of
policies of selective recognition,5 but even the latter still positions
Native nations as being subject to the authority and oversight (if not
the structural forms) of the state.

This means, as we have seen in Chapter 5, that [indigenous
governments]{.underline} such as the Council of the Haida Nation [are in
a **precarious position**, attempting to constitute their own sovereign
authority **without access** to many of the **conventional means of
sovereignty** in Western political thought]{.underline} -- e.g., the
monopoly on legitimate violence (Weber 1946), decisive authority to make
and enact law (Schmitt 2005), or exclusive territorial control (Brown
2010; cf: Hobbes 1994). [Alongside this precarity is [the]{.mark}
**equally anxious [question]{.mark}** [of whether]{.mark} or not
[sovereignty is]{.mark}]{.underline} even an
**[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}** analytical [to **center
indigenous rights around** precisely [because it is]{.mark}
**historically a [Western]{.mark} concept**, one that had been drawn on
to **dispossess indigenous peoples** over the course of settler colonial
history]{.underline} (Barker 2005:18--19). (Indeed, the very next essay
in Barker's edited volume, by Mohawk scholar Taiake Alfred,
categorically rejects sovereignty as an inappropriate tool for
indigenous political assertions for these reasons and, also, because it
draws attention away from developing and furthering "genuinely"
Aboriginal political modes of thought (Alfred 2005; cf: Alfred 2009).

The fact that sovereignty remains such a preeminent concept in the
struggle for indigenous rights even though it is both epistemologically
problematic and politically constrained has meant that [[there has been
a]{.mark} recent [push]{.mark}]{.underline} in both anthropology and
indigenous studies [[to "**widen**]{.mark}" the definition of
[sovereignty]{.mark}, so that [it might encompass **multiple
forms**]{.mark} of indigenous social, political and legal practice
**[outside]{.mark} of [the conventional purview]{.mark}** of "sovereign
power"]{.underline} (e.g. Cattelino 2008; Richland 2011; Simpson 2000;
Simpson 2014). Or, as Joanne Barker puts it:

[[There is **no fixed meaning** for]{.mark} what [sovereignty]{.mark}
is]{.underline} -- what it means by definition, [[what it **implies
in**]{.underline}]{.mark} public **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or
how it has been conceptualized in international, nation, or indigenous
law. [Sovereignty]{.underline} -- and its related histories,
perspectives, and identities -- [[is **embedded** within the
**specific**]{.mark} **social [relations]{.mark}** [in which it is
**invoked**]{.mark} and **given meaning**. [**How** and **when** it
emerges and functions are determined by the "**located**"]{.mark}
political [agendas]{.mark} and cultural perspectives [of those who
**rearticulate it into**]{.mark}]{.underline} public
**[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** or political document [to do a
**specific work of opposition**, **invitation**, or **accommodation**.
It is **no more possible** to stabilize **what sovereignty means** and
**how it matters** to those who invoke it than it is to **forget the
historical** and **cultural embeddedness** of indigenous peoples'
**multiple** and **contradictory political perspectives** and **agendas
for empowerment**, **decolonization**, and **social
justice**]{.underline} (Barker 2005:21, emphasis original).

[The opening up of sovereignty as **flexible**, **multiple**, and
subject to **all manner of diverse rearticulations** carries particular
weight]{.underline} (and, perhaps, ambiguity) [since]{.underline}, as a
historical concept in Western political theory, [sovereignty was
**overwhelmingly concerned with closure**]{.underline}. As Wendy Brown
argues in her Walled States, Waning Sovereignty, [the classic vision of
sovereign power rests in the capacity to divide the inside from the
outside]{.underline}, to make borders around a people -- a "nation" --
and separate that people from those outside it. Thus Schmitt's
"friend-enemy" distinction, for instance, or even John Locke's
consistent preoccupation with fences as a way of marking the existence
of territory (Brown 2010; cf: Schmitt 1996; Locke 1988). The historical
conditions of **[[indigenous sovereignty claims]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the context of settler colonialism make such absolute closures
impossible for indigenous peoples.

We might add, though, that their persistent presence also [[**challenges
the closure** of the settler nation-state]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed,
this is part of Brown's point. [The very fact that we see **ever more
spectacular performances** of sovereign power on the part of
contemporary nation-states]{.underline} -- e.g., the titular "walls"
that are being constructed along the borders of an increasing number of
states - [is a sign of the **very insecurity** of their political
authority]{.underline} (Brown 2010).6 [The conditions of settler
colonial sovereignty]{.underline}, in other words, [may be rather more
"**open**,"]{.underline} and thus closer to those of indigenous
"nation-within-nations," [then they **may at first
appear**]{.underline}. If this means, in turn, that the future of
settler political life is becoming as uncertain as the future for
indigenous life has always been since the advent of settlement, then
this means only what we have already begun to see: the dilemmas that
Haida people confront in their future-making practices are also the
dilemmas facing settler society. Take Chapter 4, in which the absence of
any "one" definitive governing entity compels the constitution of an
aspirational framework of accountability which could, were it realized,
render navigable Haida relations to the many governments that claim
their loyalties. As I hinted at there, such dilemmas are not restricted
to the Haida sociopolitical world; rather, they may in fact be endemic
to contemporary democratic societies and the multiple forms of
governance (licit and otherwise) that emerge therein.

In suggesting that there are Haida ways of refiguring a shared
Haida-settler set of contemporary problematics, [we might think
of]{.underline} Haida [future-making as simultaneously an instantiation
of the **multiple**, **flexible** and **always contingently located
practices** of sovereignty]{.underline} to which Barker points [and a
**different way of thinking** about indigenous political
potentiality]{.underline}. In the former sense, Haida [future-making is
without doubt concerned with **carving out spaces** in
which]{.underline} Haida [existence can **continue**, **expand**, and
**change**]{.underline} without losing the capacity to reproduce itself
as, precisely, Haida existence. Thus the processes of homecoming we
explored in Chapter 2, or Chapter 5's explicitly political attempts to
establish control over the islands for future generations. [If the
**absence of indigenous sovereignty** is the absence of the capacity of
an indigenous people to **(self)-determine their own futures**, then the
**constitution of**]{.underline} Haida [**futures** can be seen exactly
as **sovereign work**]{.underline}, whether in the overt sense of the
Council of the Haida Nation's assertions or the somewhat more implicit
mode of Alice Stevens' proposed mass adoptions. Significant here,
though, is the fact that [these acts of future-making carry meanings
**beyond their status** as "**responses**" to]{.underline} the
[**social** and **political dilemmas**]{.underline} of contemporary
Haida life. Thus Alice Stevens' adoptions bring "hippie" children into
the framework of Haida kinship relations, in one sense neutralizing
their potential threat, but also constituting a complex new network of
social relations between Haida and non-Haida whose potential
significances go well beyond the protection of Haida territory and
resources; thus the Council of the Haida Nation emerges as a
"state-like" governing entity through its authorizing promise to "take
care" of the islands, but in so doing takes on a series of new roles in
Haida political life whose full consequences remain to be seen. [If it
is a sovereign action to **envision an opening of possible
futures**]{.underline} for Haida people, [then this very openness might
also **exceed the boundaries of sovereignty** as]{.underline} a
[**problematic** for indigenous people even as it responds to
them]{.underline}.

Which is also, perhaps, why Haida futures seem so consistently to sketch
out social, ecological, and political fields that encompass non-Haida;
more, that are futures for Canada as well as for the Haida people living
within the nation-state's borders. Or, at least, futures that have the
capacity to be so. [What would it mean to figure an indigenous
sovereignty that **speaks beyond itself**]{.underline}, one [that
promises to **invert the order of settler domination** through
reconfiguring the **shared futures** of indigenous and settler peoples?
This would **not** be a sovereignty premised on **territorial closure**,
or even **absolute political autonomy**. It would]{.underline}, however,
[**decisively overturn any settler colonial anticipations** of the
**inevitable erasure** of Native peoples]{.underline}. Quite the
opposite, [it would position indigenous practices of anticipation,
aspiration, certainty, and anxiety at the **forefront** of contemporary
modes of political imagination]{.underline}.

Unsettling Futures

A question remains, however. Could such a refiguring of the temporal and
political horizon of settler and indigenous relationships remain
possible even if the futures that indigenous people work to constitute
remain unrealized in the settler colonial present? Or, put another way,
we must always be careful not to conflate a capacity to form new futures
for settler nation-states with the actual materializations of these
futures. The Haida futures that I have discussed, even as they promise
possible ways of navigating -- of restructuring, even -- the
settler-Haida present, remain firmly bound by the colonial constraints
of this present. But perhaps [[the stakes]{.mark} here [have **never
been about overthrowing the**]{.mark}]{.underline} Canadian **[[colonial
order outright]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rather, what I hope this
dissertation has shown is that Haida [[future-making]{.mark} has the
capacity to **[unsettle the settler colonial present]{.mark}**, to
[**challenge its received categories** and demonstrate how]{.mark},
**slowly**, **[gradually]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Haida [[people are
**reconfiguring its terms**]{.mark} through the work of [producing the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly, the sheer fact of Haida futurity
should put to the lie any further notion that Haida people exist only to
replicate their past or live only in the deferral of their eventual
disappearance. The future is alive and well in Old Massett, although
this does not meant that it is not also a site of profound anxieties.

In [working to **ward off**]{.underline} those [**anxieties** through
the **juxtaposition of nightmare futures** against their **more
desirable alternatives**]{.underline}, then, Haida people [[**unsettle
the epistemological foundations** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the forms of
[[settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark} and liberalism against which
Byrd and Povinelli write. At the same time (if you'll pardon the pun), I
think [we can see the social work that futuremaking does
[**iteratively**, as a **gradual reshaping** of]{.mark} the **[actual
conditions]{.mark}** of]{.underline} Canadian [society]{.underline}.
Here I borrow Judith Butler's suggestion, following Foucault, that [the
regulatory [norms]{.mark} of society [function **only** through]{.mark}
their **[consistent]{.mark}** and **unstable [reiteration]{.mark}** (and
**materialization**) in everyday social life]{.underline}.7 From this
perspective, [[the ways in which]{.underline}]{.mark} Haida [[people
**work within** and]{.mark} even [**reiterate the constraints** and
**demands**]{.mark} of]{.underline} Canadian [settler]{.underline}
mainstream [society [can]{.mark} also **slowly** and **strategically
[shift those]{.mark} very constraints** and **demands**, materializing
a]{.underline} HaidaCanadian [future that might]{.underline} in fact [be
**quite different** from the present even as it does not ever fully
"**escape**" from its dilemmas]{.underline}. Perhaps the most unsettling
potential of all here lies simply in the ways in which Haida people
incorporate the conditions of the settler colonial present as being
paths towards Haida futures. Not vanished, or vanquished. Ongoing.

Gerald Vizenor: A Little Upsetting Is Necessary In 1996 Kimberly
Blaeser's book, Gerald Vizenor: Writing in the Oral Tradition, was
published. Since Vizenor himself had featured literary criticism in
works such as Manifest Manners: Postindian Warriors of Survivance (1994)
and had contributed an essay and an introduction to Narrative Chance:
Postmodern Discourse on Native American Indian Literatures (1993), some
might wonder, Why not go directly to the source instead of to a study of
the author in question? Manifest Manners, however, is not exclusively a
work of literary criticism; one chapter, for example, is about Indian
casinos. And his introduction to Narrative Chance is a brief one.
Moreover, distinguishing between genres traditionally described as
literary criticism, fiction, cultural critique, autobiography, and
journalism is difficult in Vizenor's oeuvre, where any given writing
could contain all these elements and more. Looking at a book such as
Blaeser's, an overview of Vizenor's prolific output, and one written by
a Native critic of his own tribe, helps to locate Vizenor's attention to
literary criticism in the wide range of the genres he writes in, since
an examination of the more than twenty-five books he had written by the
time of Blaeser's study is impossible. Blaeser's book, further, contains
many continuities with the first two works of this study, The Sacred
Hoop and Other Destinies. I want to make a personal observation about
Gerald Vizenor at the outset: this is a writer I greatly admire. To
engage a fellow author at the level of ideas, and to critique those
ideas, is not to dismiss the man or his work; rather, it is to take him
seriously. The heterodoxy of Vizenor's work is one of the best things to
have ever happened to Native studies. But, like all heterodoxies, as
well as all orthodoxies, it is fraught with its own set of problems.
This statement is necessary in order to point out that here I neither
dismiss Vizenor nor do I analyze other critics (with whom I might have
certain affinities) in purely celebratory terms. I want readers to be
clear about my intent. I often reveal my biases in terms of critical
stances I agree and disagree with---this introduction is not a purely
descriptive effort---but I try to point to the philosophical
underpinnings that influence my stance, and I hope to reveal a little
bit of literary history that surrounds my choices. This is not a party
for friends nor a snubbing of enemies. For reasons I am not quite sure I
understand, saying anything about Vizenor, whether positive or negative,
has a tendency to get people all riled up. One camp says one is only
allowed to praise him, another that it is one's moral duty to bring the
man down. I ascribe to neither of these positions. Given that [Vizenor,
more than any other Native critic, is]{.underline} often [associated
with poststructuralism]{.underline}, I want to say more about its impact
on cultural studies. Poststructuralism has influenced a diverse range of
disciplines---feminist criticism, postcolonial theory, film studies, and
queer theory, to name a few. [An important concept in poststructuralism
is the infinite capacity for language to take on different
meanings]{.underline}. According to Vincent Lcitch: Because the
signifier (word) is disconnected from the signified (concept) and the
referent (thing), language floats or slides in relation to reality, a
condition made more severe with the additional sliding introduced into
language by figurative language, such as metaphors and metonymies. Such
rhctoricity (as it is called) adds layers of substitutions and
supplements (more differences) to floating signifiers. Textuality and
rhetoricity are conditioned by yet a third sliding or differential
element, intertextuality---a text's dependence on prior words, concepts,
connotations, codes, conventions, unconscious practices, and texts.
Every text is an intertext that borrows, knowingly or not, from the
immense archive of previous culture. The term (inter)textuality, with
parentheses, captures the sense of textuality as being conditioned by
this inescapable historical intertest.\*\'5 One might see, especially in
the last part of this definition, some compatibilities with orality,
particularly the notion of a passed-on tradition, the way storytellers
are informed by those tellers who came before them, those contemporary
to them, and those to come. In terms of the first part of Leitch's
definition, [[Vizenor]{.mark} borrows from the poststructural idea of
**[liberating signifier from signified to open up static definitions of
Indianness]{.mark}** (in simple language, **to challenge
stereotypes**)]{.underline}. Labeling ossified or overly generalized
definitions as "terminal creeds," [Vizenor has expended great energy on
attempting to open up the signifier "Indian" to a wider range of
signification]{.underline}. Vizenor's sophisticated take on stereotypes
is not only related to popular nonIndian representations of Native
peoples but to the stereotypes Natives cling to about themselves. [One
might also [worry]{.mark}, however, about some of poststructuralism's
incompatibilities with oral traditions, instead of assuming a perfect
fit]{.underline}, a subject Blaeser largely avoids in her study, [as
does Vizenor]{.underline} in his own work. This might be of particular
concern in relation to the way words seem to be moving away from the
things they represent in poststructuralist thought. Some might wonder
how to reconcile notions of nonrepresentation with certain ceremonial
settings, where spoken words are sometimes seen as having a physical
component or a physical effect on the world: words cause things to
happen, a very special relationship between signifier and signified.
Often the very things words represent come to be, and the happenings are
not exclusively the domain of human efforts, influences, mediations.
These are complicated matters. Ceremonial language is also mediated by
the humans who speak it and the ritual circumstances that surround it
where humans are involved, but in some tribal worldviews the powers of
language arc not created exclusively by humans. In puzzling through
these realities, we might wonder what N. Scott Momaday means, for
example, when he says, "A word has power in and of itself. It comes from
nothing into sound and meaning; it gives origin to all things."66 If all
language is socially mediated, as some would claim, some Native thinkers
might respond, "Yes, but it is also mediated by others besides humans."
[A further word of caution might be appropriate. How much free rein do
we want to give definitions? Do we want to remove "Indian" so far from
its social referents that definitions are no longer possible? **[How
would tribes manage in the world of federal Indian law if "Indian" is a
matter of infinite signification]{.mark} and ultimately undecidable?**
Can historical claims be made from a philosophical vantage point that
emphasizes that events can never be separated from perceptions, thereby
denying any kind of certitude? **[What happens if a historically
silenced minority group wants to amend]{.mark} the [histori]{.mark}cal
record [to include their side]{.mark} of the story? Can they do this [if
normative truth claims are no longer considered viable?]{.mark}** Is
simply presenting a competing narrative very satisfying if one's
community is telling its story for the first time while the dominating
group has controlled the discourse for centuries?]{.underline} Does
Native studies want to become like queer studies in its refusal to
define the parameters of its own discipline so that anything and
everything becomes its potential subject matter? **[Does [this
ambiguity]{.mark} of audience and mission help or [hurt in light of a
history of erasure]{.mark} and underrepresentation?]{.underline}** What
of the goal of Native critics who might want to focus on their own
communities for a change instead of making everybody else central to
their efforts? Blaeser's focus, for better or worse, does not include a
discussion of the broader ramifications of the theoretical field Vizenor
plays in, at least in terms of the more problematic aspects of
poststructuralism. On the other hand, in terms of poststructuralism's
power to disrupt, Native studies needs a good, strong kick in the butt
to move it beyond some of the static cliches that have kept it from
addressing difficult issues. The temptation has been to fall back on the
opposition of a balanced, communal utopia offset against a menacing
Western hierarchical society. Native people might want more agency than
this; they might want the freedom to imagine themselves anew, to act in
ways that intervene in their destinies, to view themselves as more than
the victims of Western dystopias or the happy inhabitants of a communal
lark. Native studies practitioners might want to expand into other
subject areas that heretofore have been ignored. Tol Foster's essay in
our own collection here analyzes the way Native studies has largely
ignored Will Rogers because he does not signify "Indian" in a fashion
familiar to the public at large, or even to people in contemporary
Native studies. Vizenor's work provides some of the tools for this
rearticulation of an expanded field. Blaeser demonstrates how Vizenor's
poetics, which allow for opening up texts, can contribute to such
liberation by allowing Native people to go beyond fixed, terminal
definitions and empowering them to articulate identities whose only
limits are their imaginations. One of the jobs of poststructuralism,
then, is to break down conventional oppositions by questioning binary
pairs such as writing/orality, male/female, nature/culture,
purity/contamination, civilization/savagery, straight/gay, and
white/black. Poststructuralism questions the reasons for privileging one
half of the binary pair over the other and demonstrates how each half is
dependent on the other for its existence. For example, taking the
nature/culture opposition, we might ask how metropolitan centers such as
New York City, often seen as the mecca of literate culture and art in
the so-called New World, can exist apart from a relationship to nature?
Is there not earth under New York streets? The city's inhabitants, being
human and a part of the natural world, breathe air, shovel snow, give
birth, return to the earth, and experience other natural phenomena, as
do people everywhere. Poststructuralists might question a viewpoint that
presents a big city as a threatening menace because of its distance from
the natural world. Meaning is a key issue in poststructural theory, as
it is in every theory. In the New Criticism of the 1930s meaning was
difficult, a puzzle composed of ambiguity, paradox, irony,
contradictions, and tensions. With enough patience, however, a puzzle
can be put together by the person who is smart enough to figure out how
all the pieces fit. [In poststructural thought meaning is undecidable in
the sense of yielding one definition that remains the same in all times
and places]{.underline}. Meaning is there, somewhere, and we can even
describe it, but we cannot say definitively what it is in singular
terms---[it always has multiple possibilities]{.underline}. [**Some**
skeptics might **say poststructuralism makes meaning impossible; in
reality, it makes meaning infinitely possible**: words that depend on
other words that depend on\... well, you get the point]{.underline}.
Here our puzzle does not have five hundred pieces; it has more pieces
than anyone could ever count, given all the words that have been spoken
and written and thought throughout history and all the different ways
people meant them and did not mean them and the meanings their listeners
or readers attributed or did not attribute to them. [Meanings, then, are
**not stable but infinitely contextual**]{.underline}. If we ask thirty
people to define the word "table," few, if any, will have the exact same
words in their definition. When my students start throwing around terms
like "European mindset" in order to point out Native people do not think
like Them, I ask the class what would happen if we went around the room
and had each person decide who there has a European mindset and who does
not and explain the reasons why. We never do that, of course, since I
like to avoid bloodshed whenever possible, but the statement makes a
certain point about monolithic cliches. Extending these issues to
literature, readings, from a poststructuralist point of view (given that
they are readings of language), are undecidable. One can make a literary
claim; one cannot make a definitive literary claim. [Poststructuralism,
however, is not necessarily a descent into meaninglessness (whether or
not it is a descent into relativism is a thornier issue)]{.underline}:
"The redoubled reading typical of much deconstruction rests on claims of
interest and insight, not of validity and truth. A reading or
interpretation of a text does not prove but persuades; it is more or
less compelling, productive, original, or useful. This pragmatic set of
criteria links deconstruction with contemporary U.S. neopragmatism, an
influential philosophy that insists on the contingency of all human
arrangements and concepts."67 My reading might be more convincing than
yours; however, it cannot be inherently more valuable. Yours might be
more convincing than mine in the right set of circumstances. [In Native
literary studies these ideas will come back to haunt us later when it
becomes theoretically difficult]{.underline} (although I would argue not
impossible) [to mount an argument for prioritizing Indian readings of
Indian literature, as it will also create a serious disruption in other
areas of minority studies in terms of trying to base academic
disciplines on distinctions between insiders and outsiders by
privileging one group over the other]{.underline}. In describing
Vizenor's oral influences, Blaeser draws on the theories of Walter Ong's
Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982). Ong studied
the dynamics of oral performance, especially emphasizing the role of
audience, which is immediate, for an oral storyteller as opposed to
imagined for a writer. Ong describes how stories in societies that are
primarily oral evolve systems that allow narratives to be remembered
through various forms of rhythms, repetitions, and multiple
reinforcement. Ong argues that oral storytelling depends on strong
narrative styles that emphasize action over abstraction. Primary orality
changes the very way people think, according to Ong. Unfortunately, when
one reads Ong, the characteristics that he attributes to the thought
processes of communal cultures, which he claims are resistant to
conceptualization and abstraction, sound a bit like the way his Jesuit
forefathers described the people they encountered in the New World. A
further problem is the opposition Ong creates between writing and
orality, which seems to contradict the poststructuralist theories
Vizenor relies on. One might well argue, for example, that a writer
finds ways to try to compensate for an oral performance, as do readers,
even if those processes are often subconscious ones. We might also find
ways in which orality is created by writing. In Native American studies,
for example, we might point out trends in which written texts, that is,
oral tradition collections, are passing into verbal tellings in Native
communities these days. The same kind of oppositions that make Ong's
work troubling are sometimes part of the Blaeser analysis. In the
introduction, for example, Blaeser says that Vizenor "strives to
compensate for the inadequacies of written language." She goes on to
show how Vizenor's story "Almost Browne" "comments on the origin and
existence of the words outside the static written tradition, on the
authenticity of the oral and the actual, on the presence and power of
sound and language, on the 'almost' quality of mere words."68 Blaeser
seems to privilege orality over writing, as evidenced by the phrase
"static written tradition." One question might be to what degree does
Vizenor himself do the same thing? Blaeser's comments about his work
seem to point to an innate inauthenticity in writing. One of Derrida's
famous theoretical postulates was that he "deconstructed the
speech/writing opposition by showing how writing precedes speech;
characteristically, he reinscribes the concept of writing (ecriture in
French) to mean any and all forms of inscription and at the same time
undercuts the privileging of speech as face-to-face spontaneous
utterance."69 One might compare Blaeser's statements about Vizenor, for
example, with Warrior's Tribal Secrets, published in the previous year,
that made a case for a written tradition that had been understudied, a
claim Warrior makes without privileging the written over the oral or
vice versa. While Blaeser seems to inadvertently demonstrate Vizenor's
problematic relationship with poststructuralism, not much is said up
front about his philosophical inconsistencies and sometimes haphazard
relationship with theory. Vizenor's life story includes an early
involvement with Indian activism in the Twin Cities in the mid-1960s,
which in later years evolved into a writerly relationship with activism
as a cultural critic rather than a physical participant. Some might say
that Vizenor's interest in the nonrepresentational modes of
postmodernism, in this case liberating fiction from social realism,
freeing it up for the world of imagination (Vizenor would argue that the
oral tradition is not based exclusively on a mimetic realism), marks a
similar movement in his fiction away from the real world---that he has
traded tropes for reality. In understanding these controversies,
however, a challenge for any critic of Vizenor is the enormous breadth
of his creative output---fiction is only one element. A gritty,
antiromantic, journalistic commitment composes another significant
aspect of Vizcnor's writing, which has dealt with Sand Creek, AIM
members, incarcerated Indians, and many other topics profoundly engaged
with the world of daily Indian life. Vizenor also often writes of
popular culture stereotypes and the ways that Native people themselves
fall prey to them, a point he makes in regard to what he calls the
tribal "kitschymen," in Manifest Manners. He uses the term to describe
"bone-choker Indians" and the way prominent activists have posed as
simulations of Indianness in order to capture the public's attention,
feeding into preconceived notions. Vizcnor's personal critiques are
almost always surrounded by ambiguities---while he might be making fun
of these individuals, he also seems strangely appreciative of the
opportunities they provide for laughter. If someone becomes the target
of Vizenor's irony, he or she at least might be comforted by the fact
that readers may not quite be able to tell if the person is being made
fun of or not, given the ambiguities with which Vizenor loves to
surround these depictions. Vizenor is particularly interested in the
manifestations, so to speak, of Manifest Destiny in the modern world,
where the notion of divinely ordained American exceptionalism seems to
be even more pervasive today than it was in the nineteenth century. He
coined the term "manifest manners" as a neologism for triumphalism, and
there is a whole vocabulary of Vizenor words that do not exist in any
dictionary. Some find this playfulness liberatory, others simply
annoying. The strength of Blaeser's analysis lies in her description of
the ways in which Vizenor parts company with realistic
representation---and the reasons he does it. Vizenor disrupts
journalistic and autobiographical claims to objectivity, bringing to
bear the skills of a fiction writer on his nonfiction efforts. He works
in narrative forms and brings a sense of mythic traditions to an
interpretation of factual events. While journalism and autobiography
often explore causality, Vizenor allows for competing versions of
stories that complicate explanations as to why things happened. He is
interested in the "shadows" of stories, the truths behind the facts,
that which does not get reported, the meanings of what goes unsaid,
those things that can be imagined, the larger, ongoing tribal story
beyond its textual representation. Vizenor believes that a metaphorical
approach to nonfiction can often reveal more than a "factual" one that
claims realistic representations. Readers can be empowered if they can
be encouraged to create their own shadows, their own interpretations,
rather than simply reading the story as transparent, unmediated
discourse. In these regards Vizenor's nonfiction might be related to the
gonzo journalism of the 1960s made famous by Tom Wolfe and Hunter S.
Thompson, as well as to poststructural notions of infinite
signification, undecidability, multiple interpretations. Journalism and
autobiography, like fiction and poetry, rely on language that "floats or
slides in relation to reality."70 Important to all of Vizenor's writing,
no matter the genre, is the idea of the reader's responsibility to
participate in the creation of the text and the writer's responsibility
to facilitate that participation, to leave part of the story open for
the reader's completion. The text becomes an invitation for the reader
to go beyond the words on the printed page, an encouragement for her to
seek out her own experiences. Blaeser does an especially good job of
discussing how the poetics of haiku, an early form Vizenor wrote in,
become the basis for all his writing. Tribal songs, dreams, and haiku,
because of its extreme beauty, leave a space open for the reader to
imagine his own meaning, a space that "propel\[s\] the reader beyond
mere words toward the imaginative dream vision."71 Blaeser characterizes
Vizenor's fiction [in relation to what Vizenor has called a
"**[trickster consciousness]{.mark}**." The ideology Vizenor has
developed around an analysis of tricksters is his strongest link to
poststructuralist theory]{.underline}. I want to begin here by
questioning a common assumption. [Tricksters do not originate in Native
American cultures. The word "trickster" is not a term indigenous to an
Indian language; it is an ethnographic one]{.underline}. While many
Native American cultures, as well as many European, American, African
American and Asian cultures, have story characters that resemble what we
often call tricksters, [it is a mistake to assume that tricksters
originate in Indian stories]{.underline}. One might [approach the
current universal application of trickster theories to Native cultures
with some caution]{.underline}. Certainly, the use of the word
"trickster" in Native literature has sometimes meant simply resorting to
laziness---[the **[substitut]{.mark}ion of [a cliche for substantive
analysis with attention to historical and cultural
particulars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Trickster then is a trope rather
than a reality within Native cultures**. Yet it is the very nature of
this nonrepresentational aspect of trickster that most interests
Vizenor. He **wants fiction to accomplish more than simply repeat social
science definitions of Indians**, pop culture representations, litanies
of Indian tragedies at the hands of whites, accounts of reservation
poverty, reports on Indian activism, and so on]{.underline}. Vizenor
allows his characters to take flight beyond the literal, to have access
to imaginary worlds as much as real ones. Mythic vision itself embodies
worlds of possibilities rather than reports on reality. [Vizenor
**borrows the shape-shifting abilities of tricksters to explain his own
understandings of language, poststructural theory, and issues of
representation**]{.underline}. Postmodern interpretations of literature
have questioned the role of mimesis---of the idea of literature holding
up a mirror to society---instead emphasizing the mediated nature of the
representation that is the product of a whole host of culturally shaped
institutions as well as processes that occur while reading. [Language,
with its tricksterlike capacity to take on many guises, shapes, and
manifestations, has the potential to liberate Indians from static
definitions, and Vizenor is especially **[critical of]{.mark} the
tendencies within the [social sciences to categorize Native people
rather than open up]{.mark} the signifier "[Indian" to multiple
possibilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the qualities of the
trickster that seems to most attract Vizenor is his inscrutability, and
this is beautifully illustrated in the symbolism of the story "Ice
Tricksters," from Landfill Meditations: before you can figure trickster
out, he melts on you. [Vizenor's life and body of work might be
described as a resistance to easy definitions]{.underline}. Another
important aspect of Vizenor's tricksters is the way in which they are
linked to mixed-blood identity. Mixed-bloods, in Vizenor's writing,
become "cross-bloods." The name change is significant. Critics writing
in the 1980s and 1990s often claimed that early Native writers had
depicted the mixed-blood as a tragic victim tom between two worlds,
unable to fit in either. These critics had emphasized that the more
contemporary mixedblood writer was able to mediate between the white and
Indian worlds and was inclined toward much less negative depictions, as
we observed in our discussion of Louis Owens's Other Destinies. In
Vizenor's work this is carried a step further than much of the 1980s
criticism and certainly further than in the novels from the early part
of the twentieth century. The cross-blood is inextricably linked to
comic, rather than tragic, modes of representation. Tragedy often works
toward an inexorable conclusion, comedy toward multiple possibilities
where endings only kick off new beginnings with lots left for the
reader's imagination. Because of its openendedness, the comic mode was
extremely important in postmodern fiction after World War II.
Mixed-bloods, in Vizenor's fiction, like tricksters, are not easy to
define. They are betwixt and between. [Poststructural theories have been
interested in those identities that break down oppositions, that
challenge distinctions between insider and outsider status, that remain
ambiguous. Fluid boundaries, cross-cultural exchange, skepticism about
pure culture, and challenges to cultural authenticity have all been a
part of the movements we have been tracing. Mixed-bloods obfuscate
clear-cut distinctions between Indian and non-Indian]{.underline}. [At
times such theories have gotten Vizenor in trouble. **[Native people
have not always responded enthusiastically]{.mark}** to statements, for
example, that Indians are anyone who imagines himself or herself to be
Indian, one of Vizenor's attempts to "liberate" Indians from static
definitions]{.underline}. The Blaeser book would have been better, to my
way of thinking, if it had more thoroughly acknowledged some of the
counterarguments. Particularly damning book reviews, for example, by
Robert Berner and other occasional critics, might have been
acknowledged, at least to the point of defending Vizenor against the
charges levied against him. A real value of Blaeser's book is her
ability to provide an explanation of Vizenor's famously difficult style;
its impenetrability, abstraction, theoretical jargon, puzzling
contradictions. Parsing Vizenor's prose and coming up with a reasonable
explanation is a formidable task, and Blaeser takes on her mission with
great aplomb. Yet even after reading Blaeser's plausible defense, some
readers might be left wondering why Vizenor does not simply say what he
means. Others more prone to provide a justification for what Vizenor
does might see a reflection of contemporary theory in Vizenor's writing,
especially in relation to French deconstruction and its U.S. version in
the 1980s, where communicating with an audience does not exactly seem to
be the goal of the writer; a proliferation of prose styles during this
time period seemed to mirror the notion of indeterminacy. Still, [some
might wonder if a theoretical approach that values obfuscation as much
as clarification is consistent with Native worldviews. Skeptics might
**[question the relevance of an inaccessible prose]{.mark} style [toward
intervening in the real world, where every year Native people face
issues of land loss]{.mark}, threats to jurisdiction, new [calls
from]{.mark} redneck [politicians]{.mark} for the federal government [to
end the trust relationship]{.mark} with tribes, [and so
on]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Vizenor's oeuvre is so varied that a
generalized critique is almost always reductive. [For all the
**post-Indian gobbledygook**]{.underline} in Manifest Manners and some
more recent works, other writings are entirely straightforward in their
use of terminology. Manifest Manners, in fact, has a perfectly lucid
chapter on the problems caused by Indian casinos. [Many readers would
defend the wisdom of the neologisms in more obtuse passages, seeing much
more than gobbledygook, noting, in fact, the power of Vizenor's
playfulness to open up a dialogue between theory and Indian
studies]{.underline}. [A **larger problem is the grab-bag relationship
with theory**, latching on to ideas without much consideration of their
broader implications]{.underline}. In her chapter on the difficulties of
Vizenor's style, Blaeser does explain that he often purposefully exposes
the artifice of written language so that the usual process of suspending
disbelief is interrupted. When this happens, the reader sees not so much
the story but how the story is made---the nature of its construction---
and is encouraged to consider the world outside the text. Blaeser points
out that Vizenor's is a style that requires a response, not just a
consumption of the literary work. His writing is composed of a
multilevel discourse, a network of literary, social, and critical
subtexts that break down distinctions between genres. Ambiguity and
indeterminacy are reinforced by contestatory views within the same
story. Characters speak in puzzling and contradictory ways, plot lines
are seldom smooth, and sometimes little is resolved. Like much of
postmodern fiction, basic story development of character, plot, and
setting is sometimes missing. Old-fashioned critics might see postmodern
works as simply bad writing in which authors fail to do the work of a
writer in terms of fleshing out the story for readers. Postmodern
writing, however, is often based on the assumption that readers can and
should flesh out the story for themselves. Vizenor's writing, likewise,
"gesture(s\] broadly beyond itself";72 it is strongly allusive. Given
the history of cultural studies and poststructuralism we have traced
out, it is somewhat problematic when Blaeser says in her introduction
that "Vizenor's work runs counter to the dominant literary aesthetic."73
[Vizenor's writing is deeply reflective of "the dominant literary
aesthetic," not counter to it]{.underline}. If his work runs counter to
anything, it would be the formalism of the 1930s New Critics, not the
"dominant literary aesthetic." [It is not very convincing to claim
Vizenor as a remarkable exception in relation to contemporary
aesthetics, astonishingly gifted as he may be in his ability to draw
from theory and incorporate it into a tribal perspective]{.underline}.
Along somewhat different lines, [it is not fruitful to consider
Vizenor's work as the embodiment of another kind of
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Elvira Pulitano, in Toward A Native
American [**[Critical Theory, argues]{.mark} that [Vizenor]{.mark}
completely escapes any essentialist traps** in his writing while other
Indian writers are immersed in them: "More forcefully and more
provocatively than the other theorists I have discussed, Vizenor
combines revolutionary content and revolutionary style, **[presenting
a]{.mark} significant [alternative to Western hermeneutics]{.mark}**.
Rejecting any form of separatism and essentialism as far as Indian
identity is concerned, he celebrates a discourse that is communal and
comic]{.underline}."74 [Vizenor's exceptionalism is **[not the
case]{.mark}**. **[No one can]{.mark} write, or [say, anything about the
world without ever using generalizations]{.mark}. Essentialism can be
mediated; it [cannot be escaped or "rejected" in "any
form]{.mark}**]{.underline}." **[[Monolithic treatments can be tempered
by citing historical and cultural particulars]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
emphasizing differences as often as similarities. To escape essentialism
entirely one would have to quit writing and speaking. This is one of the
reasons why naming essentialists sometimes feels more like a witch hunt
than a scholarly endeavor---to point out an essentialist will always
require having four fingers pointed back at oneself. [This is **not a
call to end the critique of monolithic treatments**. Obviously, [we
**have to question**]{.mark} **some [such claims when they become overly
reductive]{.mark}** if we are to engage in serious
scholarship]{.underline}.

### AT: Extinction/Dalley 16

#### Anticipating nuclear extinction [breeds empathy]{.underline} and [care]{.underline} -- distancing ourselves from considering extinction [reifies]{.underline} detached elitism

**Offord, 17**---Faculty of Humanities, School of Humanities Research
and Graduate Studies, Bentley Campus (Baden, "BEYOND OUR NUCLEAR
ENTANGLEMENT," Angelaki, 22:3, 17-25, dml) \[ableist language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

[You are steered towards **overwhelming** and **inexplicable pain**
[when you consider]{.mark} the **nuclear entanglement** that the
species]{.underline} Homo sapiens [finds itself in]{.underline}. This is
because [the fact of living in [the nuclear]{.mark} age presents an
**[existential]{.mark}**, **aesthetic**, **[ethical]{.mark}** and
**psychological [challenge]{.mark}** that defines human consciousness.
Although an **immanent threat** and **ever-present danger** to the
**very existence** of the human species, living with the possibility of
nuclear war has **infiltrated [the matrix of modernity]{.mark} so
profoundly** as to]{.underline} paralyse [\[**[shut down]{.mark}**\]
[our mind-set to respond]{.mark} adequately. [We have chosen to **ignore
the facts**]{.mark} at the heart of the nuclear program]{.underline}
with its dangerous algorithm; [we have chosen [to **live with the**
]{.mark}**capacity** and [**possibility** of]{.mark} a **collective**,
**pervasive** and even **[planetary-scale suicide]{.mark}**; and the
techno-industrial-national powers that claim there is "**no immediate
danger**" ad infinitum]{.underline}.8 This has led to one of the key
logics of modernity\'s insanity. As Harari writes: "Nuclear weapons have
turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and
therefore forced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative
and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts."9 This is the nuclear algorithm
at work, a methodology of madness. In revisiting Jacques Derrida in "No
Apocalypse, Not Now (Full Speed Ahead, Seven Missiles, Seven
Missives),"10 who described nuclear war as a "non-event," it is clear
that the pathology of the "non-event" remains as active as ever even in
the time of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un with their stichomythic nuclear
posturing. [[The question]{.mark} of our times [is whether we
have]{.mark} an **equal** or **more compelling [capacity]{.mark}** and
**willingness** [to **end this**]{.mark} **impoverished but ever-present
[logic]{.mark}** of pain and uncertainty. How not simply to **bring
about disarmament**, but to **go beyond** this politically
charged]{.underline}, as well as mythological and psychological
[**nuclear algorithm**?]{.underline} How to find love amidst the nuclear
entanglement; the antidote to this entanglement? Is it possible to end
the pathology of power that exists with nuclear capacity? Sadly, the
last lines of Nitin Sawhney\'s "Broken Skin" underscore this
entanglement: Just 5 miles from India\'s nuclear test site Children play
in the shade of the village water tank Here in the Rajasthan desert
people say They\'re proud their country showed their nuclear
capability.11 As an activist scholar working in the fields of human
rights and cultural studies, [[responding]{.mark} to the nuclear
algorithm [is an **imperative**]{.mark}. Your **politics**, **ethics**
and **scholarship are indivisible** in this cause. An **acute [sense of
care]{.mark} for the world**, [informed by **pacifist** and
**non-violent**, **de-colonialist approaches**]{.mark} to knowledge and
practice, **[pervades your concern]{.mark}**. You are **aware** that
there are **other ways of knowing** than those you are familiar and
credentialed with]{.underline}. You are aware that you are complicit in
the prisons that you choose to live inside,12 and that there is no such
thing as an innocent bystander. [You [use]{.mark} your [scholarship
to]{.mark} **shake up the world**]{.underline} from its paralysis,
abjection and amnesia; [to **[unsettle]{.mark} the epistemic** and
**structural [violence]{.mark}** that is ubiquitous to neoliberalism and
its machinery; to **create dialogic** and **learning spaces** for the
work of critical human rights and critical justice to take place. All
this, and to **enable an ethics of intervention** through understanding
what is at the very heart of the]{.underline} critical human rights
[impulse]{.underline}, creating a "dialogue for being, because I am not
without the other."13 Furthermore, as a critical human rights advocate
[living in a nuclear armed world, your challenge is to
**[reconceptualise the human community]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Ashis
Nandy has argued, [[to see how we can learn to]{.mark} **co-exist with
others in conviviality** and also learn to **[co-survive]{.mark} with
the non-human**, even to **flourish**]{.underline}. A dialogue for being
requires a leap into a human rights frame that includes a deep
ecological dimension, where [the planet itself is **inherently involved
as a participant** in its future]{.underline}. This requires scholarship
that "thinks like a mountain."14 A critical human rights approach
understands that it cannot be simply human-centric. It requires a
nuanced and arresting clarity to present perspectives on co-existence
and co-survival that are from human and non-human viewpoints.15
Ultimately, [you realise that your [struggle]{.mark} is **not confined
to**]{.underline} declarations, treaties, [**legislation**, and **law**,
**though they have their role**. It must go further to [produce
"**creative intellectual exchange**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} might [release
**new ethical energies for** ]{.mark}**mutually assured
[survival]{.mark}**."]{.underline}16 [Taking [an **anti-nuclear
stance**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **enabling a [post-nuclear
activism]{.mark}** demands a **revolution**]{.underline} within the
field of human rights work. [Recognising the **entanglement of
nuclearism**]{.underline} with the Anthropocene, for one thing,
[**[requires]{.mark} a profound [shift in focus]{.mark}** from the
**human-centric** to a **more-than-human co-survival**.]{.underline} It
also requires a fundamental shift in understanding our human culture, in
which the very epistemic and rational acts of sundering from co-survival
with the planet and environment takes place. [In the end, you
realise]{.underline}, as Raimon Panikkar has articulated, ["it is not
realistic to toil for peace if we do not proceed to a disarmament of the
bellicose culture in which we live."]{.underline}17 Or, as Geshe Lhakdor
suggests, there must be "inner disarmament for external disarmament."18
In this sense, it is within the cultural arena, our human society, where
the entanglement of subjective meaning making, nature and politics
occurs, that we need to disarm. It is 1982, and you are reading Jonathan
Schell\'s The Fate of the Earth on a Sydney bus. Sleeping has not been
easy over the past few nights as you reluctantly but compulsively read
about the consequences of nuclear war. For some critics, Schell\'s
account is high polemic, but for you it is more like Rabindranath
Tagore: it expresses the suffering we make for ourselves. What you find
noteworthy is that although Schell\'s scenario of widespread destruction
of the planet through nuclear weaponry, of immeasurable harm to the
bio-sphere through radiation, is powerfully laid out, the horror and
scale of nuclear obliteration also seems surreal and far away as the bus
makes its way through the suburban streets. A few years later, you read
a statement from an interview with Paul Tibbets, the pilot of "Enola
Gay," the plane that bombed Hiroshima. He says, "The morality of
dropping that bomb was not my business."19 This abstraction from moral
responsibility -- the denial of the implications on human life and the
consequences of engagement through the machinery of war -- together with
the sweeping amnesia that came afterwards from thinking about the
bombing of Hiroshima, are what make you become an environmental and
human rights activist. You realise that [what **makes the nuclear
algorithm work** involves a politically engineered and deeply embedded
insecurity-based recipe to **elide the nuclear threat from everyday
life**. The spectre of [nuclear obliteration]{.mark}]{.underline}, like
the idea of human rights, [[can appear **abstract**]{.mark} and
**distant**, **[not our]{.mark} everyday
[business]{.mark}**]{.underline}. You realise that [within [this]{.mark}
recipe [is the creation of a **moral tyranny of distance**]{.mark}, an
abnegation of myself with the other. One of modernity\'s greatest and
earliest achievements was the mediation of the self with the world. How
this became a project assisted and shaped through the
military-industrial-technological-capitalist complex is fraught and hard
to untangle. But as a critical]{.underline} human rights [scholar [you
have]{.mark} come [to **see through that** ]{.mark}**complex**,
[and]{.mark} you [put energies into **challenging that tyranny of
distance**]{.mark}, to activate a **politics**, **ethics** and
**scholarship that recognises the other as integral to
yourself**]{.underline}. Ultimately, even, to see that the other is also
within.20

While [twenty-first-century [populism]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[is
closely linked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark}]{.underline} social
media and twentieth-century populism to radio and television, the
theater provides insights into pre-1900 forms of populism. As [[the

[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} was widely perceived as a daring
experiment, **[[sought to establish and
legitimize]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[create a democratic
public]{.underline}]{.mark} between the American Revolution and the
late-nineteenth-century Gilded Age, theatrical performances were
**[[often geared]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[toward]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[strengthening]{.mark} a sense of the **[white]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In the theater, both the artistic work that is performed and whatever we
may know about those who paid to watch the show can provide insight into
specific historical contexts in which a sense of who ›the people‹ are
and what they stand for is communicated. This communication process is
not only reciprocal (contents and performance, on the one hand, and
audience response, on the other), but its microcosmic setting and
temporally limited occurrence also invite discussion of larger
socio-cultural considerations. In times when many people, especially
from the lower classes, were illiterate, public address directed at
›common people‹ used theatrical performance to enthrall large audiences
and sway public opinion. The theater thus was a venue where notions of
being-in-common were negotiated: Who was to be considered part of the
›common people‹? [Which rights and duties did these
individuals]{.underline} [have]{.underline}? [How were
those]{.underline} [who did not belong]{.underline} [to be

The [[police]{.mark} officers]{.underline} could have **[[planted

Danilov says.

So he refused to show its contents to the officers who did not identify
themselves or say why they approached him in late August 2021 in the
Arctic town of Monchegorsk in northwestern Russia.

[[Drugs]{.mark} [planted]{.mark} by police [have]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[become a routine part]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[a
crackdown]{.mark}** on]{.underline} liberal opposition, independent
journalists and human rights activists.

But Danilov is none of the above.

He is a community leader of some 1,600 Saami living in Russia's Murmansk
region near Norway. They are a fraction of the Saami [Indigenous
nation]{.underline} that primarily lives in Arctic Scandinavia in the
region which the Saami call Sapmi, a place also known as Lapland and
advertised to tourists as Santa's home.

Danilov says the search and subsequent detention were part of perennial
official pressure on him, payback for leading a campaign against
platinum and palladium mining on Saami lands, and for his victory in
July in the
Constitutional [Court](http://www.ksrf.ru/ru/News/Pages/ViewItem.aspx?ParamId=3623) which
ruled that unlicensed hunting is the birthright of any Indigenous person
as part of their traditional way of life.

Russian law suggests that only Indigenous people living in the
wilderness and not in urban centres can hunt without a licence, but
Danilov, who lives in the town of Severstal, proved that hunting is part
of his culture and beliefs.

Danilov was released hours after the news of his detention reached other
activists and independent media. But he knows the pressure is far from
over.

["**[Their main goal is to either push]{.mark} [me to flee]{.mark}
[abroad]{.mark}** [**or to force me to shut up**]{.mark},]{.underline}"
Danilov, 51, who is head of the grassroots group the Saami Heritage and

[Then there are definitions of epistemic difference based on '**lived
experience'**]{.underline}. Although an improvement on territorial or
raciological accounts, [the [ascription of **cultural
difference**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to a]{.mark} generic lived
experience or social [subjectivity]{.mark} [can also **reduce
groups**]{.mark} **of people**]{.underline} [[to **stereotypes** and
**monolithic value sets**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is [evident
in]{.mark} the work of some [scholars who take Fanon]{.mark} primarily
**[as a source of 'epistemic blackness']{.mark}**]{.underline}, [without
fully addressing his concerns about **racialisation**]{.underline} [and
the **geopolitical dimensions** of **decolonisation**]{.underline}. For
example, the philosopher Lewis R. Gordon writes that 'Fanon's body. . .
is a subtext of all his writings. \... Anxiety over embodiment is a
dimension of Western civilization against which Fanon was in constant
battle. The body, he laments, is a denied presence, and black people are
a denied people' (Gordon, 2015: 8). Even in as sophisticated an analysis
of Fanon as Gordon's, [there is a [danger of **essentialism**
through]{.mark} the [**association** of **black identity** with a
**particular way of thinking**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[For Fanon, black
people were not]{.mark} so much **[universally 'denied']{.mark}** as
**relegated to certain roles**]{.underline} [within a **social
hierarchy** -- the **French empire** most specifically. Blacks could be
of **higher** or **lower** status, but **[race]{.mark}** was the **basis
for social relegation**]{.underline}, [which [**alienated** the subject
from a **full**]{.mark}, **dynamic** **[humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[For Fanon, every **particular experience** is an **instantiation of the
universal**, and his analysis of his own experience is a demand to be
recognised as a fellow human]{.underline} with an equal stake in
humanity. [Blackness is not a **generalisable perspective**]{.underline}
[from which we can **derive a non-Western knowledge**]{.underline}, [but
a reminder to pay attention to the **social** and **historical
specificity** of relation]{.underline}.9

[[Embodiment arguments are]{.mark} usually [the **vehicle** for

[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or **being modern**]{.underline}. For
example, Vivienne **[Jabri]{.underline}** (2014) [invokes Fanon to

within]{.underline} [international order.]{.underline} Anna
**[[Agathangelou]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2016) [[links]{.mark} different
aspects of [Fanon]{.mark}'s revolutionary dialectics [to his]{.mark}
conception of the **subjugated [black body]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [She
is particularly [interested in how Fanon's]{.mark} **conception of
[racial experience]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[might present
**alternatives**]{.mark} or 'different' ways of doing
politics]{.underline} (Agathangelou, 2016: 111; cf. Sekyi-Otu, 2009). In
a similar argument, John M. Hobson contrasts the 'different critique' of
'African-American Marxists', including Du Bois, with 'white Eurocentric
institutional thinkers' like Leonard Woolf (Hobson, 2012: 17, n. 20).
However, the difference is not as stark as Hobson might hope. It is true
that Woolf's anti-racism was qualified by a belief in elite
institutional development, but so was Du Bois's anti-imperialism.10
[Areas of overlap are]{.underline}, thus, [[obscured by the

[Aside from its **dubious reliability**]{.underline}, [the problem with

### AT: Derivative Communism\-\--2AC

#### "Derivative communism" fails

**Gardiner, 20**---Professor of Sociology at the University of Western
Ontario (Michael, "Automatic for the People? Cybernetics and
Left‐Accelerationism," Constellations: An International Journal of
Critical and Democratic Theory, August 6, 2020, dml)

The notoriety of Project Cybersyn in Left‐accelerationist circles and
beyond is perhaps not entirely surprising insofar it is the best‐known
example of consciously deploying cybernetic principles for what were
felt to be emancipatory ends, rather than the augmentation of state or
corporate power.3 Due to circumstances very much beyond its control, the
system was never brought fully online, and of course we will never know
the directions in which it might have developed. However, thanks to
Medina\'s detailed and exacting research, [we have been made aware of
the sometimes **yawning gap** between]{.underline} Beer\'s vision and
how it aligned politically with [the **undeniably admirable goals**
of]{.underline} Chilean [socialism]{.underline}, [and the **actual
nature** of]{.underline} Cybersyn\'s attempted
**[implementation]{.underline}**. For instance, [worker participation
was **token** at best, and not an **integral part** of system
design]{.underline}; [engineers and factory managers **didn\'t really
overcome** their professional and class bias]{.underline}; [and **gender
inequities**]{.underline} with regard to design and organizational
management [were **barely acknowledged**, never mind **meaningfully
addressed**]{.underline} (see also Espejo, 2009, p. 79). However, [we
are]{.underline} less [concerned]{.underline} here [with]{.underline}
the historical realities of Cybersyn or the specific features of Chilean
socialism than more general **[cybernetic principles]{.underline}** [and
how they might **lend support** to any viable postcapitalist
transition]{.underline}. Put differently, to indulge in a spot of
"immanent critique," [do the claims of [Left]{.mark}‐accelerationist
[cybernetics]{.mark} regarding enhanced possibilities for human freedom,
solidarity, and autonomous self‐actualization **match**]{.underline} the
**[reality]{.underline}** (or potential reality)? What is crucial
vis‐à‐vis any such discussion is the (often implicit) suggestion,
outlined in the previous section, as to the qualitative differences
between first‐ and second‐order cybernetics, together with the idea that
Left criticisms typically, and illegitimately, conflate the two. Rather
than the use of negative feedback oriented to the maintenance of order
by inhibiting counteraction, so [the argument]{.underline} goes,
second‐order cybernetics [is [concerned with **positive
feedback**]{.mark}, working through **[amplification]{.mark}** and
**enhancement** [of]{.mark} the original signal, whereby]{.underline}
the presence of [[**complexity** and **chaotic states**]{.mark}
demonstrates]{.underline} the non‐linearity of systems and their
capacity for **[unpredictable change]{.underline}** in the pursuit of
open‐ended (but self‐correcting) goal attainment. And yet, a careful
examination of writings by the likes of Tiqqun or Châtelet demonstrate
that they were generally aware of different currents in cybernetic
thinking, but nevertheless argue that, [[**whatever** its]{.mark}
ostensible [methods and goals]{.mark}]{.underline}, second‐order
[cybernetics [promulgates a **new regime** of power]{.mark} and control
[that **dovetails**]{.mark}]{.underline} in many respects [[with]{.mark}
the requirements of [today\'s **supercharged
technocapitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Going further, they intimate
that [[even]{.underline}]{.mark} some version of "**[[cybernetic
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [with presumably novel human‐machine
assemblages, **[might not]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessarily
[**[escape]{.mark}** this morass]{.underline}.

Arguments concerning this shift to a new regime of power often make
reference to one of Deleuze\'s late essays, or at least show its
influence: the brief but tantalizing "Postscript on Societies of
Control." In nuce, Deleuze\'s position is that the type of
"disciplinary" society theorized by Foucault, marked by various
enclosures (schools, factories, military barracks, bureaucracies)
wherein social behaviors were scrutinized and minutely organized in
space‐time so as to enhance their productive efficacy during an era of
industrial capitalism, has been superseded by a quite different system
of ruling more relevant to the present situation of powerful global
corporations and the centrality of the "knowledge economy." That is,
whereas disciplinary societies concern themselves with a process of
homogenizing subjectification largely through panoptical means, by which
compliant individuals are integrated seamlessly into the mass, [control
societies]{.underline} are post‐panoptical, and [rely]{.underline}
instead [on]{.underline} "[**ultrarapid forms** of free‐floating
control]{.underline}" (Deleuze, 1992, p. 4). [Crucial]{.underline} with
regard to the latter [is the **continuous accumulation** of statistical
information via the elicitation of **communicative exchange** across the
entire social field]{.underline}. The focus ceases to be the atomized
individual, but rather a numerically‐based assessment of the "dividual,"
by which Deleuze means a generically average subject made comprehensible
through opinion surveys, sampling techniques, and market research.
[Control is now exercised]{.underline}, not [through]{.underline}
hierarchical, top‐down management, much less by fostering techniques of
hermeneutical self‐examination, but [the pattern analysis of myriad
electronic traces and the subtle shaping]{.underline} (or "nudging") [of
micro‐behaviors]{.underline} via what Deleuze calls "universal
modulation." [The key is that these environments are **not segmented**
and **closed**, but **fluid** and **open**, and that social actors
**participate** in and **maintain** the system dynamically through their
own **seemingly voluntaristic**]{.underline} choices and actions, à la
Lefebvre\'s "splendid impression of **[spontaneity]{.underline}** and
harmony."4

The relevance of Deleuze\'s "Postscript" to our concerns should be
fairly obvious. First‐order cybernetics is in lockstep with the nature
and demands of what we might call late‐disciplinary societies.
Second‐order [[cybernetics]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast,
[[appears]{.mark} more [**compatible** with]{.mark} progressive, even
[liberatory aims]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An indication of this
latter orientation is that [many]{.underline} of the [key figures
in]{.underline} British [cybernetics]{.underline} situated themselves on
the Left of the political spectrum, and [cultivated **non‐conformist**
and often explicitly **anti‐authoritarian** interests]{.underline}, even
if Beer himself was something of a "champagne socialist."
[Yet]{.underline}, in [**[embracing]{.mark} complexity**,
**[contingency]{.mark}**, and **openness**]{.underline}, second‐order
cybernetics [[is **not**]{.mark} **wholly [immune]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
the mentality of **[control]{.mark}** and **governance**]{.underline}.
Indeed, the types of [non‐linear self‐organization]{.underline} as
discussed by Deleuze [are **necessarily premised on disequilibrium** and
**chaos**]{.underline}: [[the multiplication of **horizontal**]{.mark},
**autonomously‐structured communicative [networks]{.mark}** [is the
**new mode of control**, **not**]{.mark} **any sort of [emancipation
from]{.mark} prevailing systems of [power]{.mark}**. [Control
societies]{.mark} depend **precisely** on the **constant elicitation**
of affects and desires, as **opposed** to their **repression** or
**curtailment**]{.underline}, provided they can be channeled into forms
of communicative action subject to ongoing surveillance and statistical
quantification. In second‐order cybernetics, as Maroš Krivý (2018, p.
18) usefully puts it, "[power relations [reproduce through
**proliferating indeterminacy**]{.mark}, **nonlinearity** and
**complexity**, [**rather** than]{.mark} by [**curbing** these]{.mark}
into **determinate**, **linear** and **unidirectional**
forms]{.underline}."

Writing from the perspective of the French context of the 1990s, but
hardly irrelevant to our own era of "nudge theory," smart cities, and
the like, Châtelet (2014, p. 23) suggests that the mania for
[[incorporating]{.mark} concepts of "**[chaos]{.mark}**" and
"**self‐organization**" [into]{.mark}]{.underline} what he regards as
[[**pseudo‐liberationist** thinking was]{.mark} **part** and **parcel**
of]{.underline} the intellectuals' post‐1968 [[**capitulation** to
"**market democracy**]{.mark}." The latter is **foursquare in favor** of
the "**right to difference**," calling for an **end to heavy‐handed
state interference** and]{.underline} concomitantly
**[eulogizing]{.underline}** social mobility and permanent
"**[nomadism]{.underline}**." But that\'s only because [[the]{.mark}
neoliberal [market]{.mark} itself **[loves]{.mark} fluidity**,
**movement**, and **constant acceleration**, seeking to capture [the
"**creative power of chaos**]{.mark}" through a "**cyberpolitics**" that
generates order out of the disorder of self‐regulation]{.underline}.
Authoritarianism of the obvious variety is replaced by the covert
injunction to produce and consume information, to subscribe
enthusiastically to a universal "will to communicate." Yet the
encouragement to speak in the context of today\'s "social (or "global")
factory," to cooperate, to express one\'s "authentic" thoughts and
feelings, is ultimately a coerced and deadening gesture. For Châtelet,
[the "**chaos of opinions** and **microdecisions**" relies on a rhetoric
of freedom via **auto‐emergence**, but there is **always an apparatus of
control** working discretely behind the scenes]{.underline}, and hence a
crucial distinction to be made between powerful designers and operators
and those being operated on. [Since the conventional state apparatus is
now **too slow** and **clumsy**]{.underline} to respond effectively to
the demands of the new fluid social ontology, [scientific management of
political sovereignty is rendered **much more palatable** when presented
in the guise of refined "pressures exerted by an **anonymous** and
**nonlocalized entity**"]{.underline} (p. 33). This constitutes a
"ventriloquism" of power‐effects operating through such ubiquities as
globalized market forces, intermeshed communicative networks, and the
relentless organization of "public opinion." [Any particular social
atom]{.underline}, the locus classicus of disciplinary societies, [is
**irrelevant**]{.underline} here; echoing Deleuze, for Châtelet [what\'s
important is the **modulation of network fluidity** via
"hydro‐cybernetics,"]{.underline} and the effectuation of valuational
equivalences across numerous domains through a universal system of
inputs and outputs. Whereas the Young Turks of the new cybernetic order
(the children of Lefebvre\'s cybernanthropoi?) conflate horizontality
with enhanced democracy, Châtelet is adamant that the former does not in
any way necessarily vouchsafe the latter. Indeed, [[horizontal
formations **concentrate power**]{.mark} in vital nodal points, [and are
**more effective**]{.mark} for being **anonymous** and **unseen**,
**everywhere** and **nowhere** at once, [in **contrast** with]{.mark}
"**overly [visible verticalities]{.mark}**[" that]{.mark} might
[precipitate]{.mark} **resentment** and **[opposition]{.mark}**. [The
result is]{.mark} the "**well‐mannered anarchism**" of the market,
which]{.underline}, unlike the "romantic" anarchism of old, [threatens
**no societal upheavals**]{.underline} ‐ first, because geared towards
optimal management of a coolly technocratic nature, but also insofar as
[there is [no]{.mark} worker "**[downtime]{.mark}**" in an age of 24/7
networked production/consumption, [and]{.mark} hence **little
[opportunity]{.mark}** [to **foment**]{.mark} **dreams of
[revolt]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

From the vantage‐point of the early 2000s, in The Cybernetic Hypothesis
Tiqqun takes some of these arguments further. Although Cybersyn isn\'t
referenced directly here, they hone in on the technophile Left\'s
contemporaneous fascination with cybernetic possibilities, anticipating
later positions advanced by the Left‐accelerationists and "fully
automated luxury communists." According to Tiqqun, the period of
upheaval around 1968 could be interpreted as the last reverberation of a
cycle of struggles that dominated Western societies over the two
previous decades. [Facing]{.underline} the manifold shocks of rising
worker militancy, the energy [crisis]{.underline}, and
precipitously‐declining rates of profit, global [capitalism required
**full‐scale reconstruction**, and]{.underline}, as discussed above,
[cybernetics **fit the bill very well**]{.underline}. However, [the
logic of cybernetics appealed to]{.underline} certain
technologically‐oriented [**critics** of capitalism as
well]{.underline}, such as those advocating an "ecosocialism" premised
on equilibrium and a steady‐state economy through decentralization and
differentiation, especially in light of the Club of Rome\'s famous 1972
document "Limits to Growth." For Tiqqun (2020b, p. 98), however, [this
represents a kind of "**social capitalism**" seeking change through the
democratization or socialization of the "decisions of production," as if
a **full‐blown post‐Fordist society** could **emerge spontaneously**
from a dispersed, popular "**collective intelligence**."]{.underline} As
an example, a "new social contract" like universal basic income adopts
the logic of the current system\'s emphasis on "human capital" and the
metaphysics of production. It is not incompatible with money, commodity
exchange, or markets, and would only free up more disposable income so
as to accelerate the circulation of goods and information at the behest
of processes of value‐capture (see also Beech, 2019, p. 93). Ultimately,
for Tiqqun [this would make the labor force itself **more**, rather than
**less** pliable. [If]{.mark} the "new spirit of [capitalism]{.mark}"
[is **cybernetic to the core**, so are "**Left**" solutions]{.mark} to
the present crisis [that rely]{.mark} extensively [on
**repurposing**]{.mark} **existing infrastructures**]{.underline},
neoliberal subjective dispositions, and logistics, [so as [to end up
with]{.mark} a "**[communism]{.mark} of capital**."]{.underline} Or, to
put it differently, [any approach advocating the "framing of the world
in terms of problems" is **not a genuine communist project**, but in
reality **another path to capitalism**]{.underline} (Tiqqun, 2020b, p.
109; also Culp, 2018, p. 167). In this way, [cybernetic capitalism has
**absorbed** its ostensible opponents into an **overarching paradigm**
of social regulation governed by a **managerial reason**, disposed
to]{.underline} what The Invisible Committee (2015, p. 124) terms [the
"**cult of the engineer**," that can serve the political objectives of
"Left" **just as well** as "Right."]{.underline} Even Pickering (2010,
p. 273) admits that Cybersyn could have been re‐engineered by
technicians and state functionaries of the Pinochet regime, and deployed
to more nefarious ends than Beer would probably have imagined, which is
likely not the kind of "repurposing" Left‐accelerationists have in mind.

It is noteworthy that Alex Williams has written independently about the
relationship between Deleuze\'s theory of control societies and
cybernetics, and it is therefore important to consider his arguments
here. Rather than contrast the US and UK developments, and primarily
associate "first‐order" cybernetics with the former and "second‐order"
with the latter (a convention we have followed here), Williams advances
a different set of distinctions. That is, he reserves the term
first‐order for 20th‐century cybernetics in general, whatever the
differences between, say, Weiner or Beer (odd in light of his admiration
for Cybersyn, which gets only passing mention here), and suggests
second‐order is a phrase better‐suited to the networked "platform"
systems of the 21st‐century, such as Airbnb, Facebook, or Uber.
First‐order cybernetics, by Williams' reckoning, follows the domineering
control logic as characterized above: it aims to modulate action via
recourse to homeostatic equilibrium so as to realize pre‐set goals. In
contrast, "platforms" are design architectures that work primarily not
through constraint, but by enabling [actions through positive feedback
circuits that **cannot be prefigured** in advance]{.underline}.
Platforms, writes Williams (2015, p. 223), are "materialised
transcendentals -- they act as conditions of possibility for other
processes and entities to exist." As "entrenched" infrastructures they
do restrain in certain ways (for example, Microsoft owns the vast
majority of home computer operating systems and forces users to conform
to its licensing arrangements and surreptitious forms of data
collection), but they also [provide the ground for **unpredictably
contingent** or "**generative**" outcomes, and hence contain
**hitherto‐untapped potentialities** for [autonomous self‐organization
**outside** the]{.mark} aegis of [**state** and
**capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [Williams [is]{.mark} **notably
[vague]{.mark}** [on what forms]{.mark} of such self‐organization
[**might be possible** here, or **what exactly** is being
"**enhanced**"]{.mark} through the utilization of such platforms in ways
[that]{.mark} might be considered "**emancipatory**," assuming this
[doesn\'t **bolster**]{.mark} the [hegemonic power]{.mark} and virtual
ubiquity of existing platforms]{.underline}. As argued earlier,
[[control systems work]{.mark} **precisely** [through such
"**enhancements**]{.mark}," via the solicitation, reinforcement, and
augmentation of myriad desires and affects]{.underline}, so long as they
can be successfully captured and "put to use." "Platform capitalism"
emerged after the 2008 crisis, argues Sebastian Olma (2016, p. 171),
because of capital\'s need to both create and exploit a situation of
permanent entrepreneurialism and precariousness in an era of falling
profits, disinvestment, and declines in manufacturing productivity. In
other words, the harnessing of auto‐exploitation is integral to these
systems' very design, whereby "platform proletariats" are pauperized
both materially (participants in the "gig economy," once time, expenses,
and insurance are factored in, earn much less than even the minimum
wage) and in terms of a relentless degradation of skill and knowledge.
As such, [[it\'s **difficult to see the liberatory potential**]{.mark}
here, insofar as such platforms are essentially about **extending market
logic** into any and all domains of human life]{.underline}. In
[this]{.underline} context, Beer\'s algedonic meters, however crude or
well‐intentioned, seem to anticipate today\'s omnipresent data capture
and the vast amounts of unpaid digital labor it exploits (Amazon user
reviews, Facebook "likes," etcetera), which are all forms of "soft"
coercion encouraging the formation of certain subjective dispositions in
line with the demands of hyper‐productivity and acquisitive consumption.
Towards the end of the article, Williams belatedly [suggests that
**alternative platforms** could be constructed in the service of
**non‐capitalistic ends**. Yet, [it\'s **far from clear** how]{.mark}
these "[**socialized**" systems could]{.mark} **ever [be
designed]{.mark}** [and **implemented**, never mind **constitute
any**]{.mark} **sort of [threat]{.mark}** to the monopolistic,
privately‐owned platforms dominating Western societies today, and
**[even if they were]{.mark}**, such a scheme [remains **vulnerable**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the objections of Tiqqun et al. as to [the
foibles of "**[social capitalism]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

### AT: Girard/Mimetic Desire (Bauman '15)

#### Their Bauman evidence uses 'mimetic violence' to predict the aff's drive for mastery\-\--this is vapid\-\--not all desire is mimetic

**Wilson '17** \[Andrew, Teaching Pastor at King's Church London, and
has theology degrees from Cambridge (MA), London School of Theology
(MTh), and King's College London (PhD). "Debunking Girard"
<https://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/debunking_girard>)NFleming

[René Girard is intriguing]{.underline} for several reasons, but for me
[the most intriguing is that so many people take his famous mimetic
theory seriously]{.underline}. I\'ve been pointed in his direction
numerous times by well-meaning readers (often, it must be said, eager to
dissuade me from preaching substitutionary atonement), and there are
sections of the academy where his (admittedly fascinating) concept is
revered as if it has been demonstrated, rather than merely suggested. So
Joshua Landy\'s article, Deceit, Desire and the Literature Professor:
Why Girardians Exist, is very welcome, not just for its readability and
caustic wit---though that too---but for its compelling critique of a
widespread idea. Landy certainly pulls no punches. "What's the
difference between Girardianism and Scientology?" he asks early on. "Why
has the former been more successful in the academy? Why is the madness
of theory so, well, contagious?" He begins by summarising Girardianism
for the uninitiated: (1) all desire is "mimetic," in that we desire
things because other people desire them; (2) therefore we have rivalry,
and thus violence; (3) thus we have scapegoating, as a single victim
takes the collective rage of a society; (4) at which point we turn to
Jesus, and find that the victim of collective violence is actually
innocent, which exposes the structure of society and thus removes its
power. Elements (3) and (4) are, he suggests, "so fanciful that it's
hard to know what to say about them," but the body of the article is
taken up with rejecting (1) and (2), both sociologically and literarily.
So, for a start[, shared desire does not produce rivalry or violence
unless]{.underline}, as Hobbes argued a long time back, t[here is not
enough to go round: Is it really true that all violence is a by-product
of mimetic rivalry]{.underline}? Here's the kind of situation Girard is
asking us to imagine. [Two men, Jimmy and Joey, stand beside a lake on a
hot day. Jimmy decides to go for a swim. Joey, who would never have had
this idea in his life, immediately decides to do likewise. Inevitably,
this causes a death struggle between the two men as they fight over the
lake]{.underline}. The scenario above is of course absurd. [Not only is
it ludicrous to imagine that Joey couldn't have had his own, autonomous
hankering to take a dip]{.underline} (we'll come to that in a moment);
[it's also ludicrous to imagine that anyone in their right mind would
start a fight in these circumstances]{.underline}. (Beaches are simply
littered with people not fighting with each other.) But why not? Isn't
it true that "[as soon as we desire something that is desired by a model
sufficiently close to us in space and time . . . we strive to snatch the
object away from him]{.underline}"? **[No, of course it
isn't]{.underline}**. Jimmy and Joey are standing right next to each
other, yet Joey has no desire whatsoever to deprive Jimmy of his
opportunity to swim. And the reason is simple: [there's plenty of lake
to go around. [**Mimetic desire is not enough to cause rivalry**; in
order to have rivalry, you]{.mark} also [need scarcity of

first place]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[:]{.underline}** "Nothing is more
mimetic," declares Girard, "than the desire of a child." One wonders,
has he ever met a child? Has he ever tried to feed one a brussels
sprout? "[Yum yum," we say, absurdly hoping that our desire for healthy
food will carry over mimetically]{.underline}. "[Blech," says the
child]{.underline}, unceremoniously spitting it out. [[You can't get a

parents eagerly eating healthy food till the cows come home, but they
will stand right by their decision to yell for marshmallows. (Not to
mention their decision to yell for more. Where did little Suzie get the
desire to hear the same story ninety-six times in a row? Surely not from

preSocratic philosopher who claimed (more or less) that everything is
made of water. Here I am, then, running around saying "everything is
water" to anyone who will listen. "[[Don't be ridiculous," you tell me,
"not everything is water." "All right," I concede, "only some things are
water (namely, the watery things]{.mark}); but isn't that more modest
observation an important one to bear in mind?" [The problem with my
"Some Things Are Water" campaign is]{.mark} not that the claim is false;
it's [that everyone already knows it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Girard and Culture As Kaplan notes, [Girard argues that the scapegoating
mechanism marks the **origins of**]{.underline} religion and
**[culture]{.underline}**, which are somewhat to be identified, sort of
religion-culture (109). [In this way Girard renders the universal
presence of primal religion more transparent]{.underline}, not as merely
the product of primitive superstition, but as inherent in the notion of
culture itself. [My]{.underline} **[concern]{.underline}** [here is that
Girard's portrayal of the origins of culture **present culture itself as
intrinsically problematic**]{.underline}; or as Milbank suggests, [there
is more than a hint here of the **ontological priority of
violence**]{.underline}. [Culture's origins lie in a primitive
originating murder]{.underline}, recast as a founding religious myth to
mask its true nature. Culture/religion is then built on a lie. The
gospel is then cast as the unmasking of this lie and the laying bear of
the scapegoating mechanism and our complicity in it. Again my concern is
not with the plausibility of this construct to explain important
features of primal religious culture. **[The question is whether it is a
complete account]{.underline}**. [Is there a place in our story of
culture's origins for **intelligence**, **reasonableness** and
**responsibility?**]{.underline} [Is there a place for a **non-mimetic
wonder** and **awe** in an awaking into consciousness of the universe of
being in those first human beings?]{.underline} In a more down-to-earth
way, [is there a place for the **practical intelligence** that developed
the **axe heads** and **spears**, the **pottery and leatherwork**, the
**nascent agriculture** and the like, that allowed human populations to
**grow and flourish** creating the leisure for an emerging mathematics
and science to raise above the demands of common sense and strive for
genuine explanatory knowing?]{.underline} If I may draw on Eric
Voegelin's cultural typology, [Girard is strong on cosmological
culture]{.underline} in his account of primal religious culture; and
equally cognizant of soteriological culture in the role he gives to the
gospel; [but what is missing is any recognition of the role of
**anthropological culture**]{.underline} (always keeping in mind that
these are types, not cultures per se).7 While [Girard]{.underline}
acknowledges the importance of Karl Jasper's notion of an axial period
(115), it seems to me that he [does not attend to]{.underline} the two
different **[responses that emerge]{.underline}** at this time **[to
cosmologically dominated cultures]{.underline}**: one anthropological as
exemplified in the person of Socrates; the other soteriological as
initially revealed in the Old Testament culminating in the person of
Jesus. [These represent]{.underline} two different **[responses to the
mimetic crisis]{.underline}**. [The first seeks an **intelligent**,
**reasonable** and **responsible** resolution to the
crisis]{.underline}; the second is to recognize the innocence of the
victims of history. These possibilities suggest three ways of
resolution: the way of sacrificial violence (the scapegoating
mechanism); the way of self-transcendence (anthropological); and the way
of self-sacrificing love (soteriological).8 One advantage here is that
it allows us to understand the scapegoating mechanism as parasitic on a
more fundamental good; it is a privation of the good and hence not in
itself foundational to culture. While it may share in the omnipresence
of sin, still sin is not fundamental to what it is to be human.
Conclusion It seems to me what we have playing out here in the realm of
cultural anthropology is the very traditional theological schema of
grace, nature and sin. [Girard's approach]{.underline}, it seems to me,
[is a transposition into the cultural realm of a very]{.underline}
**[Augustinian grace-sin dialectic]{.underline}**, [and carries with it
all the **problems** associated with that dialectic]{.underline}: e.g.,
rather than the total corruption of the sinner [we now have the
**totally corrupt origins of human culture**]{.underline}. [Into this
dark picture the recognition of a human nature **teleologically oriented
to meaning, truth and goodness** offers]{.underline} **[a shard of
light]{.underline}**, [something that may be diminished by sin but
**never extinguished**]{.underline}. Indeed I might go so far as to
suggest that [without the recognition of this "natural" element,
Girard's cultural grace-sin dialectic runs the risk of **perpetuating a
further system of "us graced---them sinners" and consequent mimetic
doubling and the very scapegoating that he was seeking to
avoid.**]{.underline}

### AT: General Strike/Cognitive Strike\-\--2AC

#### Cognitive strikes are [utopian]{.underline}, [empirically impotent]{.underline}, and get [cracked down on]{.underline}.

**Nowak and Gallas, 14**---PhD in political science AND Assistant
Professor in the Department of Political Science, University of Kassel
(Jörg and Alexander, "Mass Strikes Against Austerity in Western Europe
-- A Strategic Assessment," Global Labour Journal, Vol. 5, No. 3, dml)

[The frequency of general strikes]{.underline} during the crisis years
[**surpasses** anything seen post-1980]{.underline}: the number of
general strikes in the EU-15 plus Norway was 18 between 1980 and 1989,
26 from 1990 to 1999 and 27 between 2000 and 2009 (Hamann et al., 2013).
In contrast, [there were **38** general strikes in the period between
2010 and May 2014]{.underline} (own count). The focus of this strike
wave is in the five countries with the highest incidence of general
strikes since 1980, which are all severely affected by the Eurozone
crisis: 19 of these 38 strikes were in Greece, six in Italy, five in
Portugal, four in Spain and three in France. In Belgium, there was one
general strike in January 2012, the first one since 1984 (ibid.).

[But this [increase in]{.mark} the incidence of [general strikes is **no
reason for optimism**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the side of labour: [The
context]{.underline} of the wave of general strikes [is a **long-term
decline** of the **relevance** of]{.underline} economic
[strikes]{.underline} in the same countries. While the average number of
strike days per year had been 16.6 per 10,000 employees in 1980-2 for
the EU-15 plus Norway, it fell continuously to 1.1 in 2004-6 (Hamann et
al., 2013). The strike activity also fell if we consider the share of
workers (out of 1,000) on strike: In Western Europe, it plunged from 97
in the 1970s to 67 in the 1980s and 29 in the 1990s (Scheuer, 2006:
148f). In the 2000s, the number went down again, this time to 21
(European Commission, 2011: 46; Vandaele, 2011: 29). In other words,
[unions were **increasingly unable** to organise sectoral
strikes]{.underline}, which can be explained with the restructuring of
work and labour relations in the neoliberal era and its results: the
overall decline of industries with a strong union presence; a secular
decline of union density; and the fact that many trade unions focussed
their strategies on (industrial) core workers, whose numbers also
decreased (Vandaele, 2011: 32f.).

The upsurge of general strikes is a consequence of the fact national
governments increasingly adopted neoliberal and austerity agendas:
welfare state retrenchment moved the terrain of struggle to the
political level. Governments curtailed social rights and workers rights,
as well as cutting public expenditure. This development gained traction
in the course of the global financial and economic crisis when
governments started to impose draconian austerity agendas in an
authoritarian fashion. This suggests that the increasing popularity of
political strikes and general strikes is due to the fact that
governments on the whole refused to negotiate with unions when they
adopted the politics of austerity.

[[While]{.mark} the [participation]{.mark} in general]{.underline} and
political [strikes since 2008 [was **spectacular**]{.mark}, [they
were]{.mark} on the whole **[unsuccessful]{.mark}**. There is [**not a
single case** of a government offering **substantial
concessions**]{.mark} after one of the general strikes since
2008]{.underline}. Similarly, [there were [**minor concessions** only in
**one** case]{.mark}]{.underline}, the general strike in Belgium in
January 2012. This in stark contrast to the period before 2008: Between
1980 and 2011, there were government concessions in 27 of 68 cases (40
per cent; substantial: 8, minor: 19) and no concessions in 41 of 68
cases (60 per cent) (Hamann et al., 2013). Post-2008, one and two day
[general strikes]{.underline} (and even the fighting strike in France in
2010) [were **ineffective** regarding material concessions]{.underline}.
In other words, [the class relations of forces in the crisis were
**unfavourable** to labour]{.underline}.

The Limits of Quantitative Analyses

Interpretations of the strike wave since 2008 diverge considerably.
Stefan Schmalz and Nico Weinmann argue that there is a trend towards
more irregular conflicts and more incoherence between countries compared
with the wave of mass strikes from 1968 to 1973 (Schmalz and Weinmann,
2013). Kurt Vandaele contends that there is an increasing convergence
between European countries, both in terms of the long term decline of
economic strikes (Vandaele, 2011) and the growing significance of
political mass strikes (Vandaele, 2013). Gregor Gall also sees a trend
towards convergence, which consists in the growing significance of
political mass strikes and the emergence of the public sector as the
centre of trade union activities (Gall, 2012).

Both Vandaele and Gall highlight that there are limits to quantitative
analyses as they have been conducted in the past 30 years, thus
questioning to some extent their own approaches. Vandaele implies that
if strike action takes place in the public sector, it is not primarily
at decreasing profits, but at disrupting everyday life through the
suspension of public services. In this context, the number of days not
worked, or of workers participating, are not the best indicators for the
strength of a stoppage because it is possible to block a service with a
small number of workers (Vandaele, 2011: 33). It follows that analyses
of labour activism should take on board qualitative factors in order to
grasp the full picture. Gall highlights other aspects when he discusses
the limits of quantitative approaches: Many political strikes in the
public sector and many general strikes are not counted in the official
statistics -- despite the fact that they have been a dominant form of
industrial action in Europe at least since the 2000s (Gall, 2012: 14f).
For Gall the decrease of strike activity is exaggerated if one operates
on the grounds of these numbers.

The limits of quantitative approaches are visible in Schmalz and
Weinmann's analysis, which draws its political conclusions almost
entirely from an evaluation of quantitative data about 'nonnormative
conflicts'. They state that trade unions exercise less control over
mobilizations than they did between 1968 and 1973 (Schmalz and Weinmann,
2013). It disappears from the picture that many of the big trade
union-led stoppages in the 1970s drew their momentum from wildcat
strikes (Birke, 2007: 218f, 274f.; Gallas and Nowak, 2013), which is not
the case for the current European strike wave, where union federations
predominantly instigate the action.1 Hamann et al. (2013) also work with
a quantitative approach, trying to detect patterns that explain under
which circumstances general strikes yield successful results. Since the
current strike wave is marked by the general absence of concessions,
this methodology is difficult to apply. In contrast, Gall's analysis
considers the political context of the European strike wave, explaining
its novelty by highlighting that unions are either excluded 'from the
process of political exchange' (Gall, 2012: 2) or that political
negotiations increasingly yield poor results for workers. Following him,
there has been an erosion of corporatism, which means that the political
strike became the primary means of struggle in France, Greece, Italy,
Spain and Portugal. According to Gall, this form of strike has strength
to it because it entails big political mobilizations as 'expression of
collective discontent against and contestation of neoliberal policies'
(Gall, 2012: 20).

A Luxemburgian Typology

In this section, we propose a qualitative account of mass strikes
inspired by Rosa Luxemburg. With regard to the recent wave of mass
strikes, we can show what type of industrial action we are examining,
and where its strategic limits lie. For this purpose, we develop a
typology of strikes based on a qualitative description with four axes.

LUXEMBURG'S UNDERSTANDING OF MASS STRIKES

While scholars tend to reflect on the political context of political
mass strikes and its strategic implications, they tend to neglect two
aspects: The strikes are defensive strikes, and they are, to a large
extent, without success, \-- despite the unprecedented size of the
mobilizations. Before we elaborate on these aspects, we will discuss the
concept of the 'mass strike', which is used by Gall and Vandaele without
providing a proper definition. We believe that Rosa Luxemburg's work
provides some insightful observations on mass strikes, which can be used
to determine the concept. These can be found in her text The Mass
Strike, the Political Parties and the Trade Unions, written in 1906,
after the strike wave that led up to the (failed) Russian revolution in
1905. Obviously, there is no revolutionary situation in contemporary
Europe (quite the contrary), but we believe that we can gain some
general insights from Luxemburg by isolating her observations from their
historical context.

She does not confine the concept of 'mass strike' to political strikes
and highlights that purely economic strikes sometimes very quickly get a
political dimension. One of her examples is a stoppage in the railway
repair workshops in Kiev in July 1903. The strike movement grew after
the police arrested two delegates of the railway workers. The subsequent
blockade of the local railway station led to a police massacre with more
than 30 dead workers. On the next day, a general strike started in all
parts of Kiev. Inspired by these events, there was a general strike in
Jekaterinoslaw in early August 1903 (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 125). The
famous strike in Petersburg in January 1905 exhibits a similar dynamic:
Two workers were dismissed because of their membership in a legal
official workers' association. About one week later, 200,000 workers
attended a march to the castle of the Tsar in order to submit a
petition. A bloodbath followed, leaving between 200 and 1,000 workers
dead. This in turn paved the way for a wave of mass strikes that lasted
until the summer of that year, which led to the introduction of the
8-hour day in many sectors of the Russian economy (12 to 14 hours were
the standard before the events) and to wage increases of around 15 per
cent all over the country (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 127f).

But Luxemburg underlines differences as well: While the strikes in 1903
started as sectoral, economic strikes and became political conflicts in
their final phase, the mass strikes in 1905 reversed the pattern: they
started with a unified political programme and led to many partial and
independently organized economic strikes all over Russia. This
distinction is not just of historical importance, but pertains to a
central feature of Luxemburg's understanding of mass strikes: The mass
strike does not exhibit a unified pattern and cannot be identified ahead
of its unfolding in a concrete struggle: 'Its adaptability, its
efficiency, the factors of its origin are constantly changing'
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140). It is only possible ex post to chart mass
strikes in a given conjuncture. But there are some defining features,
which we can extract from Luxemburg's account of the events in Russia:
First of all, they disrupt political life, affect public discourse and
provoke massive responses from governments or other state bodies
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140f). A second central aspect is the mobilizing
character of mass strikes for the working class: Workers experience the
power that goes along with collective action, gain experience in
political struggles and see the need for organization. Importantly,
these are qualitative features: the mass strike is not defined on the
grounds of simple numbers (be they absolute numbers of participants or
working days lost or relative numbers compared to the size of the
population), but in terms of its effects, both on the political scene
and the working class. In this sense, the 1984-5 Miners' Strike in
Britain can be seen as a mass strike (even though it was confined to one
industry); in contrast, the public sector strikes in Germany in 1992 and
2006 involving hundreds of thousands of workers are not necessarily mass
strikes, because they did not have persistent effects on the political
scene and their mobilizing character for the German working class was
limited.

Importantly and contrary to some readings of her work, Luxemburg does
not glorify the mass strike. She underlines that there are limits to its
effectiveness in the Russian context: While the first general strike in
January 1905 led to a national wave of economic strikes, and a second
national strike in October ended with political concessions of the Tsar,
the third general strike in December resulted in defeat: An armed
uprising of workers in response to state repression against the strike
in Moscow was crushed by the military, and efforts by the social
democrats to organize a fourth national strike in 1906 were not
successful (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 139f.). Luxemburg concludes the
chapter with the following words: 'The role of the political mass strike
alone is exhausted, but, at the same time, the transition of the mass
strike into a general popular rising is not yet accomplished. (...) The
stage remains empty for the time being.' (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140).
This suggests that calls for mass strikes are only useful in specific
conjunctures, and that other forms of political and social action
prevail in other periods.

FOUR ANALYTICAL DISTINCTIONS

Against this backdrop, we propose a typology of the mass strike inspired
by Luxemburg's analysis (cf. Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 25f.). We use four
distinctions to describe the different types of the mass strike. These
distinctions are inspired by Luxemburg, who operated in a similar way
without providing a systematic conceptual elaboration. They are
analytical in character. Of course, the reality of a particular strike
is always messy and sometimes produces grey zones that complicate or
even defy categorization. But it is impossible to understand the causes,
dynamics and effects of strikes without the use of analytical
distinctions.

1\. The first distinction concerns the aims of strikes. It runs between
economic strikes that relate predominantly to the workplace, and
political strikes that address extra-economic issues. Economic strikes
address issues such as wages, layoffs and working conditions. One
example for a political strike is the fight for universal suffrage: the
labour movements in Belgium, Britain and Germany in the 19th and early
20th century demanded the vote not just through demonstrations, but also
by going on strike. Luxemburg emphasizes that political and economic
strikes constantly blend into each other (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 144).

2\. The second distinction relates to the extension of strikes: there
are 'partial' strikes that affect just one sector of the economy
(sectoral strikes) or one particular region or city (local or regional
strikes), and general strikes that cut across sectors and are held at
the national level (for Luxemburg's use of the term 'partial', see
1906/2008: 142).

3\. The third distinction is about the direction of a strike movement:
Offensive strikes aim to reach a goal set by the strikers themselves
(that is, wage increases or the recognition of independent unions by the
state and employers), while defensive strikes try to block measures
proposed by the government or employers (that is, layoffs or cutbacks of
pensions) or are intended to defend rights such as universal suffrage or
freedom of the press (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 119).

4\. The fourth distinctions reflects the form of strike: Demonstrative
strikes voice the opinion of workers and are limited to one or two days,
while fighting strikes are about striking until the goal of the stoppage
or a compromise has been reached, or until the workers decide to give in
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 143).

The vast majority of the mass strikes in Western Europe since 2008, on
the grounds of our typology, are political strikes because they are
directed against plans of the government to restrict rights and cut
social expenditure. Furthermore, they are defensive and general strikes.
Finally, they are usually demonstrative strikes limited to one or two
days.2 In a nutshell, the type of strike dominating the Western European
wave of mass strikes is the political, general, defensive and
demonstrative strike.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

Vandaele stresses that there are regional patterns of strike activity,
and he is grouping European countries into five categories according to
their different industrial relations regimes (Vandaele, 2011). For a
group of 'Southern' European countries -- France, Italy, Greece, Spain
and Portugal -- he describes a common pattern characterized by
'long-lasting employer hostility towards union recognition' (Vandaele,
2011: 16) and a weak institutionalization of collective bargaining.
Similarly, Gall argues that the political mass strike became the main
strike method in the same countries since the late 1990s, reflecting the
fact that the ties between social democratic parties and the union
movement have not been very close in these countries, given the huge
weight of communist trade unions (Gall, 2012: 20ff).

What is noteworthy is that the countries in question are also those
where the vast majority of political strikes against austerity happened
after 2008. So one could see this as a case of path dependency rather
than a new political dynamic. But there is still a much higher frequency
of these strikes since 2009. This suggests that two factors come
together: First, the countries already had an established tradition of
the political strike, which emerged in the late 1990s; and, second, the
countries are worst hit by the Eurozone crisis (with the exception of
France). Besides, there is a genuinely new development in that the
strike wave reaches countries that do not belong to this first group:
there were political strikes against austerity in the UK (which,
according to Vandaele, belong to a Western European group) and in
Belgium (which belongs to a Western-central European group). In the UK,
the strikes have so far been confined to the public sector, but there
are debates among the unions about the possibility of a genuine general
strike (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 70ff) -- something that has not taken
place in the country since 1926.

Political Strikes Against Austerity as a Reflection of the Conjuncture

The type of strike that is prevailing in the Eurozone Crisis, the
defensive political strike, is both a reflection of a specific political
conjuncture and of class relations of forces unfavourable to labour. Two
aspects of this situation are important for debates on strategies: the
fact that the strikes have been unsuccessful to a large extent and the
fact that they are facing 'physical limits' in the form of violent state
repression.

Against this backdrop, it appears that many of the big trade unions in
the countries that are affected heavily by the crisis are halfway stuck
between organizing protests against austerity and attempts to keep
channels of negotiations open. This is changing slowly in some of the
countries, for example in Britain, Spain and in Portugal, where unions
are beginning to take a more confrontational stance vis-à-vis
governments. To illustrate the two aspects, we will take a closer look
at the strike against the pension cuts in France in October 2010, given
that they were most advanced form of protest against austerity: it went
against the dominant pattern insofar as the strike was not a
demonstrative strike limited to one or two days; in fact, it lasted for
about three weeks.

THE FRENCH STRIKE AGAINST PENSION CUTS

In spring 2010, the French government announced pension cuts. As a
reaction, a three-week general strike against pension cuts erupted in
October 2010, the main issue being the increase of the retirement age
from 60 to 62. Similar mobilizations in 1995 and 2006 had brought
substantial concessions (Lindvall, 2011). The strongholds of the 2010
strike were the refineries.

The strike was unsuccessful despite the fact that there was a broad
consensus among the main trade unions behind the strike and public
opinion was in favour: According to opinion polls, 60 to 70 percent of
the population supported it. Furthermore, participation in
demonstrations was high -- much higher than in 1968 and comparable to
1995 (1968: 500,000; in 2010, 2.5-3 millions on various occasions).
However, in 2010, the number of workers on strike was comparably low:
estimates run between 500,000 and 1,000,000. In 1968, nine million
workers were on strike, and in 1995, it was considerably more than one
million workers. (During the 2006 protest movement, there were no mass
strikes) (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 56ff; USS, 2010).

In 2010, participation rates among important groups like railway workers
and students were low because these groups had just been defeated in
drawn-out conflicts that had taken place only a few months before the
strike. The main bases of the strike were the oil refineries, the ports,
and the public sector in the region of Marseille. Outside these main
bases, the strikers were very much dispersed across sectors and
workplaces, so that demonstrations became the focal points of the
mobilization. Obviously, these demonstrations did not have much of an
impact on the economy or the public infrastructure. The strikes in the
refineries, which led to a shortage of fuel, had not been organized
properly by the unions. As soon as the police and military arrived at
the scene, the strikers gave up blockading (Gallas and Nowak, 2012:
59ff).

Arguments between the main unions (CFDT - Confédération française
démocratique du travail and CGT - Confédération générale du travail)
resulted in a moderate strategy: When the fuel shortages led to problems
in the productive sector, the main unions distanced themselves from
blockading refineries and fuel stores. The main unions were not prepared
to start a proper confrontation with the Sarkozy government, because
they believed that the Socialist Party (PS) was not ready for a change
of government: The PS was divided on the issue of pensions and quarreled
about the party leadership. Sarkozy's strategy to refrain from offering
negotiations or concessions surprised the unions. It was a new pattern
of class politics in France.

The conditions of struggle throughout Europe had changed considerably
with the onset of the financial crisis, but the main unions in France
used the same old political strategies (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 59ff):
they wanted to change public opinion. Furthermore, they banked on the PS
gaining the presidency in 2012 and repealing the restructuring of the
pensions system. Hollande was carried to office by the strike movement
but did not deliver on the demands of the strikers that he had included
in his agenda. His attempt to restore the status quo ante in the area of
pensions was half-hearted: the return to a lower pension age (60) will
only affect 110,000 people. The focus of the unions on a change of
government turned out to be a strategic mistake.

DEADLOCK

The French example reveals the deadlock that trade unions in many
European countries face in the crisis. [The]{.underline} old
[strategies]{.underline} of working with threats and blockades as well
as hoping for negotiations and changes of government [**do not appear to
work** any longer]{.underline}. The [political strikes]{.underline}
against austerity conform mostly to what Beverly Silver (2003: 20) calls
'Polanyi-type of labor unrest': they are struggles predominantly based
in sectors where layoffs, privatisations and restrictions of workers'
rights pose a threat to the existing labour force. This constellation of
struggle [produces **specific challenges** and **dilemmas**]{.underline}
for labour, which mean that [[winning is
**difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[If]{.mark} public sector
[workers]{.mark}]{.underline}, who were crucial for most of the
mobilisations in Europe, [[go on strike, the state **saves
money**]{.underline}. [The strikers can]{.underline}]{.mark} [make up
for this by **[interrupt]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} the economic and
social **[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example by
blockading public transport and roads, [[but this is **difficult to
sustain** and **creates tensions**]{.mark} with the infrastructure
users]{.underline}. Furthermore, [if workers are indeed **blockading key
sites** of the infrastructure or of production, [there is]{.mark} a
[**real danger** that the]{.mark} repressive [state]{.mark} apparatuses
[**break strikes with force**: this happened]{.mark}]{.underline} when
air traffic controllers struck [[in **Spain**]{.mark} in 2010,
[and]{.mark} also in **[France]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2010 at the
refineries.

[Surely, the political [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} against austerity
[[had a **mobilizing** character. But]{.mark} the fact that
unions]{.underline} in the crisis countries [on the whole **[did not
gain any concessions]{.mark}** -- [neither through **negotiations**
nor]{.mark} through [attempts to exert '**influence from
without**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Gall, 2012) -- [reveals that the
[working classes]{.mark}]{.underline} in these countries [generally
**[lacked any]{.mark}**]{.underline} sort of [**political
[leverage]{.mark}**, which goes **further** than just saying that we are
witnessing the '**end of social democracy** as a credible political
force']{.underline} (ibid.). [And [in]{.mark} those [cases where
workers]{.mark} were able to [**mount effective resistance** and **put
pressure**]{.mark} on governments, **[repressive]{.mark} state
[apparatuses intervened]{.mark}** on their behalf]{.underline}. How is
it possible to overcome this impasse? There are three possible ways: (1)
blockades are so widespread and massive that there are not enough
repressive forces available to effectively break them; (2) political
pressure is strong enough that the government withdraws from violent
intervention; or (3) labour activists develop new tactics that deal with
violence in one way or another. The first option of [an all-out
[blockade seems **utopian**, and it is **difficult** to build
**effective political pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the labour
[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark} across Europe [**cannot evade** the
question of **how** to build up effective pressure when faced with
governments **unprepared** to make concessions, but ready to **break
strikes with violent means**. If organized labour is not able to address
this question, 'the stage will **remain empty**']{.underline} for the
time being.

Strategic Lessons

Unions are faced with a dilemma in the European crisis. They find
themselves in a situation of weakness where it would be better to lay
low and gain strength first, but they are not controlling the conditions
under which they operate. They are under attack and cannot afford to
lose because this would have devastating consequences: unemployment and
impoverishment for the working [people]{.underline} in the crisis
countries and a seriously constrained room for manoeuvre for labour. In
this situation, they [tend to [resort to]{.mark} staging
**[symbolic]{.mark}** political [strikes]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} thus
[become the terrain for]{.mark} the **[reconstitution]{.mark}** for
working class movements]{.underline} across Europe. [The [strikes are
**supposed** to represent]{.mark} shows of [**strength**, but their
**results**]{.mark} in terms of concessions [are
**meagre**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words,
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} across the Eurozone [[have **called
the bluff**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the trade unions [[by **choosing not
to move**]{.mark} in response to the strikes]{.underline}.

In this situation, unions have to rethink their strategies. But [[it is
**not enough** to]{.mark} simply [call for]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[radicalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of trade unionism. [There are
reasons why unions resort to the **rather moderate means** of the
**symbolic political strike**]{.underline}. Thanks to the crisis, their
members are faced with the serious economic hardship caused by wage
cuts. Furthermore, they are under the threat of being laid off, and
finding a new job is very difficult under conditions of a deep economic
crisis. The 'silent compulsion of economic relations' (Marx, 1867: 899)
is further amplified through cuts in the welfare system, which make it
even harder to cope with unemployment. Finally, [it is **difficult** to
call for a radicalization [when people have **already been
defeated**]{.mark} at various occasions, [which has a **demoralizing
effect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this situation, [[**simplistic calls**
for militant action have a ring of **radical
posturing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result, the starting point of any
debate on union strategy should be on the existing pattern of struggle,
and how its elements can be recomposed to lead to a more forceful
result.

But [what would **emerge in its place?**]{.underline} Still politics,
but hopefully [a **reformed politics** that can travel into the
future]{.underline}. The word ['reform' sounds tame besides our
preferred terms of revolution and transformation but **I use it
advisedly** in the context of Foucault's caution against **constructing
utopias that degenerate into biopower**]{.underline}. [The [**dilemma
with necropolitics** is that even as we **protest it**]{.mark}**s putrid
formations**]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} often [lose sight of how
much it has entwined itself around our lives]{.underline}, swamped and
overwhelmed our vision, language, relationships, communities and lives.
[[We ignore how deeply we are invested in]{.mark} and complicit with
[it]{.mark}s norms and enticements]{.underline}. So perhaps **[[seeking
reform]{.mark} or transformation [is a first step to
recognizing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, unlike the local party bosses of
China, [our own [complicity]{.mark} in corruption and in systems of
power and fear]{.underline}. Although the medical field utilizes
surgical debridement to save lives threatened by necrotic trauma, the
only assured mode the human species has of defeating death is ensuring
that life is constantly birthed. So [at various levels of the
polity]{.underline}, [[we must continue to
**mobilize**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**debate** and seek]{.mark} to
elect **[ethical]{.mark}**]{.underline}, visionary and responsive
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}; demand a national political structure
rooted in true federalism; and hold leaders in all societal sectors
accountable for their discourses and actions or lack thereof. However,
[[at a]{.underline}]{.mark}n individual and [[collective
level]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we must]{.mark} also be prepared to [birth
new modes of life]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[This is the ultimate
challenge to necropolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In practical and
basic terms, [it translates to our [genuine]{.mark}]{.underline}
personal and sustained [[commitment to **protect human
dignity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, to fulfill our personal determination to
eradicate and alleviate poverty, provide just employment, support those
who are marginalized and in need, respond to those rendered vulnerable
in the mounting humanitarian crisis, protect the environment in trust,
deal with honesty and integrity [[and generate **progressive social
relations**]{.mark} rooted in the desire for **justice**]{.underline},
[**equity** and **peace**]{.underline}. [[Despite]{.mark} our global and
national **[context of violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[we are
surrounded by]{.mark} numerous examples of [those who deploy a
**politics of life** to **challenge**]{.mark} **systemic necrotic
[decay]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To highlight one example, the Stephen's
Children's Home in Abeokuta is an initiative birthed by a Nigerian
committed to children who lost one or both parents in the various
eruptions of religious violence in northern Nigeria. The residential
center cares for over four hundred displaced children who all have
heartbreaking narratives of trauma, rape and lossthey have experienced
necropolitics in a manner that is irreversible, but the courageous
determination of their Nigerian caregiving team and supporters
challenges necropower in the lives of the children more effectively than
some more popular modes of engagement that left them exposed and
vulnerable to continued violence and suffering. This is not about mere
acts of charity. [It is about taking committed steps to]{.underline}
self-[transformation]{.underline} and actualization, [[breaking free of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~paralyzing~~ [[legacies of]{.mark} biopower
and [necropolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[creating models]{.mark}**
and sustaining visions **[of the future]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and
re-establishing a **national framework** for lasting]{.mark} voice and
[change]{.mark} within the citizenry and political
leadership]{.underline}. There is no simple set of rules for reforming
the nation, but among other things [we do need]{.underline}: 1.
[Acceptance of the fact that]{.underline} Biopower and **[[Necropolitics
will not vanish]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}**. 2. Readiness
to be discomfited and challenged, to occasionally lose faith in the
system and its promises, to find oneself intellectually and
socio-politically afloat. 3. New visions and the capacity to live as
practical visionaries, reimagining and reconstructing alternative and
progressive spaces at every level. We must re-examine each space we
inhabithome, work, community and nationand conceive of how to
transform that space to enhance human dignity and equity, to establish
microsystems that meet critical needs in a manner that is principled,
collaborative, effective and sustained. 4. [A [focus on]{.mark}
**critical mass [transformation]{.mark}** [that recognizes]{.mark} the
[**limitations of one individual** and the **capacity of the state to
coopt** and **constrain solo idealists**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[As]{.underline} democratic [activists]{.underline}, [human rights
workers]{.underline}, [environmentalists]{.underline},
socio-[politicians and [progressive institutions]{.mark}]{.underline},
[we [must seize on innovative ways to create]{.mark} collaborative
networks that will achieve and sustain our struggles for
[socio-political change]{.mark} without being overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the task]{.underline} 5. Ethical courage and integrity:
Necropolitics generates decay throughout a system and the most difficult
battle is the individual struggle to sustain personal integrity and
voice in a framework that entices us to do otherwise.

**Bickerstaff 17** (Jovonne Bickerstaff is a Post-Doctoral Associate,
"Of Wake Work and We Who Would Build: Centralizing Blackness in Digital
Work", February 2017,
<http://aadhum.umd.edu/2017/02/centralizing-blackness-digital-work/>
///ghs-sc)

In my own research[, I am drawn to Christina Sharpe's conception of
"wake work." **[Wake work does not]{.mark} seek to [amend Black
suffering through]{.mark} the frames of juridical, philosophical, or
[historical solutions.]{.mark}** Wake work theorizes Black life in both
the "wake" and the "hold" of the slave ship]{.underline}, requiring
recognition "of the ways that we are constituted through and by
vulnerability to overwhelming force, though not only known to ourselves
and to each other by that force." This is critical Black study that does
not seek to make room for the full scope of Black humanity to be
recognized by the white consciousness. Rather, it works to "defend the
dead" through the cultivation of a 'blackened consciousness' that would
inhabit the ways that we are both living and dying in the wake. In my
own digital humanities work centered in New Orleans, 11 years after the
storm, this means staring unflinchingly at the political, economic, and
intellectual assemblages that over-determine Black life/death, while
simultaneously understanding how insurgent Black social life can
undermine these over-determinations. Is digital wake work possible? If
so, what can it look like? That is the question that I intend to work
through as a researcher within the AADHum Initiative. If it is indeed
true that, as Moya Z. Bailey says, "All the Digital Humanists Are White,
All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave," then it's time to
say---in the words of Jonathan P. Jackson---"Gentlemen, we will be
taking over from here." In our work, how can we discover and further
develop digital lines of escape, made possible by the apertures that
emerge at the collision of Black Studies and the digital humanities? We
who would build: Re-visioning resistance & theorizing beyond the gaze
---Jovonne Bickerstaff, Ph.D. We have two hands: one is to battle, one
is to build. We battle. We resist by calling out threats to our dignity
by name. We build. We actively protect our dignity by creating what
works. Those two hands may be on one person, one organization may be set
up to do both. For others, they are the battling or the building kind.
Either way, the battlers need the builders. The builders need the
battlers. This is a discipline of resistance. ---Brittany Packnett,
activist Outlining her concept of "Black studies in the wake," Christina
Sharpe emphasizes its call "to be at the intellectual work of a
continued reckoning the longue of Atlantic chattel slavery, with black
fungibility, antiblackness... accounting for the narrative, historical,
structural, and other positions black people are forced to occupy."
Drawing on Alexander Weheliye, Kim Gallon, by contrast, characterizes
Black Studies as "a mode of knowledge production" that "investigates
processes of racialization with a particular emphasis on the shifting
configurations of black life." Building on the Duboisian tradition of
intellectual activism that advances scholarship while furthering social
justice, both suggest that the real and vital work on black people
necessarily speaks to race---that is, analyzing the consequences of and
resistance to the project of racialization. [I can see how interrogating
the racial project of whiteness that shapes black folks' lives can be a
way of speaking truth to power for African Americanist scholars. Still,
[focusing]{.mark} so [acutely on unpacking racism]{.mark} and
racialization [as]{.mark} sole or [primary path of resistance gives me
pause]{.mark}. I wonder if [we've framed what Black Studies
does]{.mark}---and more importantly can do---**[too narrowly]{.mark}**.
Might [our pre-occupation with black struggle]{.mark}, whether in the
conditions of or resistance to oppression, **[make us complicit in the
diminishing the fullness of black humanity]{.mark}** and what we might
explore in it? [Can we imagine examining black experience without making
America's racialization project the dominant idiom?]{.mark}]{.underline}
Recently, activist Brittany Packnett developed a Twitter thread which
began, "**[[We have two hands: one is to battle, one is to
build]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Certainly, we African Americanists know
how to battle. So much of our training as scholars prepares us for it;
we're socialized to privilege the work of critique and deconstruction.
Given how black folk have been conceptualized or written out of cannons,
[our [proclivity towards confrontational debate may be]{.mark} more
[pronounced]{.mark}. We feel the pulse of that resistance when Gallon
characterizes Black Studies as "the comparative study of the black
cultural and social experiences under white Eurocentric systems of
power." [But... is that enough? Is our conception of black scholarly
resistance too narrow?]{.mark}]{.underline} Taking Packnett's call for a
multifaceted strategy of resistance to heart, I must ask, when do we
build? These questions are central to who I've become as a scholar.
Surely, I do my share of confrontational resistance, interrogating
problematic paradigms, particularly when I teach. Still, as my research
agenda solidifies, **[[I'm more compelled by that call to
build]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Centering black experience has been my
entry point for moving beyond critique to imagine new narratives and
inquiry to engage in what I term theorizing beyond gaze---orienting my
own work and my hopes for the AADHum Initiative. "From my perspective
there are only black people. When I say "people", that's what I mean...
No African American writer had ever done what I did... even the ones I
admired... I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not
writing about white people... As though our lives have no meaning and no
depth without the white gaze. And I have spent my entire writing life
trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one ... I
didn't have to be consumed by or concerned by the white gaze... The
problem of being free to write the way you wish to without this other
racialized gaze is a serious one for an African American writer"
\[emphasis added\]. ---Toni Morrison Freedom for her, Nina Simone once
quipped, was the absence of fear. As a scholar and writer, my vision of
freedom is more akin to Toni Morrison's and begins with one radical
tool: choice. I name, frame, and lay claim to different terrains:
examining understudied populations (couples in enduring relationships),
raising novel questions (how emotional strategies for resilience impact
intimacy), and situating my research in unorthodox literatures
(sociology of emotions vs. "the black family"). In every case, each
she/he/they that I describe is, by default, black. Refusing to
explicitly qualify race in work on black people can be jarring because
having non-white experiences centered is so rare. [In addition to
disturbing notions of black folks as the perpetual other, theorizing
beyond the gaze forces us to recognize how failing to fully account for
positionality undermines our theorizing.]{.underline} [If we uphold
confrontation as the primary or most effective tool of resistance, I
fear [we risk neglecting how resistance requires and]{.mark} has always
[relied]{.mark} as much [on]{.mark} subversive tactics like [theorizing
beyond the gaze as on direct action]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the AADHUM
initiative, I hope that helps us think through how can we begin to
construct a "meaningful intellectual and activist challenge that
circumvents the analyses of injustice that re-isolate the dispossessed,
à la McKittrick's invocation of Gilmore. It'd be easy (and reductive) to
see black Twitter simply as an offshoot of mainstream Twitter use. But
what if we saw it instead as innovation narrative, à la Steve Jobs and
iPods and iPhones, whereby they're responsible for optimizing technology
use in ways that reveal its fullest potential? Or conversely, could we
invert the arrows of co-optation, which typically focuses on stolen
African American products, to reveal how communities of color used
Twitter and Vine towards subversive ends of mobilizing social change
(i.e. BLM), celebrating black joy in the mannequin challenge or viral
memes on Vine? [Ultimately, [how, when and why we enter as African
Americanists, seems to turn largely on who we are working for and what
we are working towards. The aim is not to abandon the battle, but simply
to recognize that]{.mark}, while necessary, [it is
insufficient.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The alt forecloses meaningful political action

**Shulman, 21**---teaches political theory at The Gallatin School of New
York University (George, "Fred Moten's Refusals and Consents: The
Politics of Fugitivity," Political Theory, Vol. 49(2), 272--313, dml)
\[inserted "when" for grammatical integrity---insertion denoted by
brackets\]

In turn, radical democrats may refuse his reduction of politics to
sovereignty, but [if we]{.underline} then [identify the **properly
political** as **[nonsovereign]{.mark}**]{.underline} action, as nonrule
or (fugitive) **[[refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be governed, [we
[remain **captive** to]{.mark} this [**demonic picture** of
power]{.mark} and its **idealized other**. By affirming **only** the
"**power to**" of solidarity and action in concert, we [risk
**disavowing**]{.mark} power "**over**," as **[participation]{.mark} in
rule**, as **explicit rule-making**, [and]{.mark} as "[**ruling out**"
antidemocratic interests]{.mark} and practices. [Do we imagine that
generativity thrives **only by refusing**]{.mark} **rule**, [and not
also through]{.mark} forms of [**structure** and even
**imposition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as parents and teachers know? As
Prospero, a personification of both sovereignty and theory, finally
acknowledged Caliban as the "dark thing" he must "own as mine," the
trope of fugitivity entails a disavowed remainder, [the **problem of
power** and **rule**]{.underline}, which **[needs to be
acknowledged]{.underline}**. For [[freedom requires **not only flight
from rule**, but]{.mark} **flight [into it]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} as a
problem that **no one can escape**, but that a democratic politics
**explicitly acknowledges** and undertakes to **rework by participatory
practices** of contest]{.underline}.40

Using Moten's own idiom, I would ask: ["What if" we **do not
dichotomize** the informal assembly and praxis of fugitive sociality,
and politics-as-rule predicated on exclusion and regulation of
difference? "What if" a democratic theory must **blur** the social and
political but also [acknowledge]{.mark} **inescapable**, **fraught**,
yet **potentially [fruitful tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}---between
tacit grammar and explicit acts of translation, [[between **informal**
form and **organized**]{.mark} forms of [power]{.mark}]{.underline},
between fugitive aliveness as resistance to rule, and organizing
democratic power to make claims on how the world is ruled? ["What if" we
**refuse** (**not reverse**) the **abstract polarity** between
subjection to sovereign rule as such, or statelessness as **refusal to
be governed** as such, and "come down to earth"]{.underline} as Marx put
it? [We then [find politicality]{.mark} **not in rule** or
**nonrule**]{.underline}, as such, [but [in the **judgments**]{.mark}
and **actions** by [which]{.mark} subalterns [address **who makes
decisions** (and **how**) about **which practices**]{.mark}, **values**,
and **inequalities** [are]{.mark} being [**ruled out**,
or]{.mark}]{.underline} which **[[encouraged]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
the communities they are building by socio-poetic insurgency? [In
difficult historical contexts [they **rework**]{.mark} and **mediate
tacit grammars**, **customary practices**, and **explicit forms of
[organized power]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} they reconstitute
**[[democratic forms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of rule-making.41

These what-ifs suggest a conversation between Moten and Sheldon Wolin.
The parallels are striking. Wolin depicts a "system" so "immovable and
interconnected as to be unreformable as a totality"; he calls
"pessimism" a "reasoned insight" and "suppressed revolutionary impulse";
and he endorses a "rejectionism" whereby citizens "withdraw and direct
their energies and civic commitment to finding new life forms."
Moreover, "instead of imitating most political theories," which adopt
"the state as the primary structure, and adapt the activity of citizens"
to it, Wolin refuses "the state paradigm" and the "liberal-legal
corruption of the citizen." He affirms how "common life resides in
cooperation and reciprocity that human beings develop to survive, meet
their needs, and explore their capacities and the remarkable world into
which they have been cast." He thus rejects Arendt's splitting of
political and social, and her valorization of the "who," and in Moten's
terms he instead values how "entanglement and virtuosity" are negotiated
in the "common life" of the ordinary. Both theorists thus defend
"preservation" of customary ways of "taking care of beings and things,"
as Wolin says, against neoliberal correction, progressive promises of
incorporation, and radical romances of emancipation.42

Moten's two antagonisms---between the few who run things and things that
run, and between informal form and formalization---echo Wolin's critique
of bureaucracy, of "institutionalized systems of power," and of
"constitutional democracy"; and Moten's refusals resonate with Wolin's
late claim that democracy names not a form of government but "fugitive"
moments of insurgency. And though Wolin seems to mean "fugitive" only in
its temporal sense of transient or fleeting, he also depicts democracy
as interdicted by idioms of governance, contained by constitutions and
organized power, and pathologized by norms stipulating the legal and
proper. Like blackness--- though Wolin never makes this
association---his democracy is (called) criminal, transgressive, and
chaotic; it is feared, hunted, and enclosed, though also "wanted,"
desired, and used for legitimation. Both theorists embrace such epithets
while showing how insurgency bespeaks "jurisgenerative" energies,
engendered by commonality and memory, that precede and surround formal
(state-centric) politics. Their fugitive protagonists---an undercommons
or popular insurgency---claim a spatial and symbolic distance from a
deranged modern regime, and in Wolin's words "replace the old
citizenship" by "a fuller and wider notion of being, whose politicalness
will be expressed not in one or two activities---voting or
protesting---but in many." Of course, this very "politicalness" is one
mark of deep differences.43

Though Wolin's awareness of racial inequality appears in repeated
associations of democratic moments and social movements with black
insurgency, he does not grasp how "commonality" names not (only) a
resource against enclosure but the historical production of whiteness
and settler colonialism. He laments the gap between formal citizenship
and genuine participation, which effectively disempowers legally
enfranchised citizens, but never construes citizenship as a racial
status, "standing" as white, constituted by a racial state of exception.
His hard-pressed "citizens" draw on tacit (local, rooted) customs, but
he does not credit how their "commonality" reproduces popular power by
racial terror. Moten thus brings to this idiom of commonality and
democracy, as to Arendt's "common sense" and "world," a justified
presumption that such predicates of the political mean antiblackness.
But acknowledging this truth is also the premise of thinking abolition
and radical democracy together.44

For if Wolin's commonality risks racial innocence, his idea of [[the
political]{.mark} remains **essential** because it [highlights]{.mark}
the [**foreclosures** in]{.mark}]{.underline} Moten's sociality. First,
Wolin depicts both tacit commonality and explicit insurgency as
contingent and, in that sense, as political. Whereas Moten depicts
[[sociality **underwritten by ontology**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
**reproduced**]{.underline} as antiblackness generates "common
habitation and flight," Wolin sees every (under)common undone by
political economy and individualism, not only [by **incorporation** into
formal politics]{.underline}. Whereas Moten imagines the "absolute
sufficiency" of sociality informally reproduced, Wolin argues that
[commonality]{.underline} itself [is (re)generated and remade **only**
by practices that, though "emerging out of" sociality,
**politicize**---**acknowledge**, **(re)articulate**, or
**(re)organize**---**tacit customs** and **vernacular memories**. Tacit
[commonality is]{.mark} at once discovered, remade and [regenerated
**only** \[when\] people make]{.mark} **explicit claims** in "[**public
declarations**," or]{.mark} **visibly [exercise]{.mark}** ["**collective
power**" to "promote]{.mark} or protect the well-being" of [a
"**collectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}," including an undercommon.45

Second, Wolin also links and distinguishes sociality and politicality by
depicting the experience and practice of sharing and exercising power.
For Wolin, local or customary "institutions and practices are sustained"
only by our "capacity to share in power, to cooperate in it." ["Power
to," generated and shared by the **ongoing practices of assembly** and
**cooperation** that Moten calls **[planning]{.mark}**, is thus the
**basis** of all other goods. But]{.underline}, as "distilled" from the
"relations and circles we move within"---call this Moten's
sociality---[this power, at once "**symbolic**, **material**, and
**psychological**," "**enables political beings to act
together**."]{.underline} As the political dimension of sociality,
["power" can be **extracted by states** or **undermined by
individualism**, and thus alienated, a loss that **devitalizes the
solidarity**---and thereby the **generative capacity**---of
sociality]{.underline}. The recurring "loss of the political," as
capacities to articulate the tacit and organize power, reveals the
nature of the political as a distinctive "mode of experience," for "we
are always losing it and having to recover it." [But "**renewal**" is
**always possible**]{.underline}, partly "as human beings rediscover the
common being of human beings," [partly by "creating **new patterns of
commonality**" across differences, and partly by (re)making "**modes of
action**" by which to "**concert their powers**."]{.underline} Though
grounded in sociality, Wolin's political thus opens an interval between
the tacit and the explicit, in which experience is metabolized and
(re)articulated. [In this interval people **question the organization of
power** and **rules of justice**, and they **answer** as they
"[**reinvent forms**]{.mark} and **practices**" [that express]{.mark} "a
**[democratic]{.mark} conception** of [collective
life]{.mark}."]{.underline}46

For Moten, of course, "democratic" and collective" signal the alienated
rule that abstracts from lived sociality to "designate" a political to
represent us, whereas black fugitives refuse to be governed or
represented by others but also to translate themselves into legible
political terms. In contrast, Wolin offers a potentially fruitful, not
only correctional or appropriative---we might say agonistic---relation
between the tacit and the explicit. In fact, [practices of "**[fugitive
democracy]{.mark}**" recurrently emerge in and from black sociality, as
the practices of **Black Lives Matter** activism most recently
[demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}. For sure, [[practices of
**concealment**]{.mark} and **evasion**]{.underline}, which defend black
fugitivity from surveillance, regulatory correction, and violence,
[**[and]{.mark}** practices of **[public action]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [**[engage]{.mark} whites** and [the **state**]{.mark}, are
**contradictory in crucial ways**]{.underline}, as Juliet Hooker has
argued. [But]{.underline} as Rom Coles and Lia Haro argue, [frontline
communities on the underground railroad also **engaged repeatedly** in
"**flagrantly public**" action [in **concert**]{.mark}, both in
**literal self-defense** of black autonomy in its fugitive illegality,
and to **contest the rule(s)** of police, the law, and the
state]{.underline}; as recent protests suggest, [[they viewed]{.mark}
**formal political [institutions]{.mark}** [both as "**integral to white
supremacy so far**," but also "as]{.mark} **potential [instruments
toward emancipatory ends]{.mark}**."]{.underline}47

If Hooker sees temporal shifts between moments of "black fugitivity" and
moments of "fugitive democracy" in the thought and practice of Frederick
Douglass, Coles/Haro depict an ongoing "oscillation" between
inward-facing and outward-turning practices. Likewise, Neil Roberts
defends grand marronage for seeking a "sustainable rather than fleeting
form of flight" by forging autonomous spaces, and yet, because
"[[freedom]{.underline}]{.mark} in our world [[lies **not in permanent
evasion of Leviathan**]{.underline}" [but in "**taming**"
it]{.underline}]{.mark}, he proposes an idea of "sociogenic marronage"
to reconstruct "an order in need of systemic repair." Not
coincidentally, Wolin's [fugitive democracy, though "**rejectionist**"
and **antistatist** in its major chords, includes a **social democratic
minor key**, which notes the **limits of [localism]{.mark}** and the
**necessity of seeking** and **using state power** to address structural
inequality and collective fate]{.underline}.48

Complex and generative tensions are lost, then, as Moten [[recovers the
**freedom schools**]{.mark} organized [by Fannie Lou Hamer but **not her
organizing** for the **right to**]{.mark} **vote**, to
**[exercise]{.mark} popular sovereignty locally**]{.underline},
especially around police and schools, [but also to create a
"**Mississippi Freedom [Democratic]{.mark} Party**" that entered
national [politics]{.mark}. Hamer (like the Black Panthers and Black
Lives Matter) models how black radicalism has lived in an **interval**
between the]{.underline} tacit grammar and [ongoing "**planning**" of
black fugitivity]{.underline}---as loopholes of retreat practiced and
concealed in plain sight---[and **flagrant publicity** as **fugitive
democracy**]{.underline}. Whereas for Moten, the historical failure or
defeat of outward-facing public action proves the futility of fugitive
democracy, I would ask: "what if" we follow his own fugitive view that
any being or act is both incomplete and excessive, to infer that
[[specific historical experiments are **not definitive failures**, but
**unfinished** ]{.mark}**in meaning**, [examples we could **retrieve**
and **refashion**]{.mark} now? If keeping open such possibility **risks
cruel optimism**, foreclosing it **reifies the impasse** he]{.underline}
generatively [transvalues]{.underline} in so many other ways.

### AT: World Computer\-\--2AC

#### The World Computer is overly simplistic.

**Markland, 21**---Teaching Fellow in Politics and International
Relations at Aston University (Alistair, "Epistemic Transformation at
the Margins: Resistance to Digitalisation and Datafication within Global
Human Rights Advocacy," Global Society, February 3, 2021, dml)

As established in the first section of this article,
[[proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of what I have heuristically defined
as the "transformation thesis" [have [emphasised]{.mark} the
**revolutionary [ruptures]{.mark}** [wrought by]{.mark} **digital
connectivity** and **[datafication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of these
proponents illustrate these changes using field specific case studies,
as with Duffield's (2018) suggestion that the transition to a
"cybernetic episteme" is [reflected [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
humanitarian practice. Other authors have taken a more abstract view,
including Chandler's (2018) [discussion of **[new modes of
governance]{.mark}** in the digital era, or the post-humanist drive [to
reconceptualise "**humanity**" under]{.mark} conditions of
**[technological entwinement]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cudworth and Hobden
2013). These assertions of macro-level transformation are also supported
by network sociology, led principally by Manuel Castells (2010) analysis
of how revolutions in information technology, economic globalisation and
an emergent "space of flows" interact to produce a new kind of "network
society". [This linkage of societal transformation to economic forces is
also characteristic of **more [critical anti-capitalist
perspectives]{.mark}**, as with the Marxist critique of "**cognitive
capitalism**"]{.underline} (Moulier-Boutang 2012; Zukerfeld 2017).
[Although these approaches **differ** in their conceptual frameworks,
they [are **united**]{.mark} in their ambition [to highlight
**universal**]{.mark} **epistemic [transformations]{.mark}** [brought
about by **tech**]{.mark}**nological [change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[One of the **pitfalls** of these **totalising perspectives** is the
**neglect** of the **particular**]{.mark} in favour of the
**universal**]{.underline}. For instance, networked thinking encourages
assumptions about lateral transformation across socio-political fields
that are connected to the digital universe. But [**[not all
spheres]{.mark}** of social or political activity [move at the **same
pace**]{.mark} [when]{.mark} they are [exposed to tech]{.mark}nological
innovation. [Datafication]{.mark} and digitalisation are processes that
[have **uneven impacts** on different]{.mark} social and political
[fields]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [the testimony
of]{.underline} Facebook's CEO Mark **[Zuckerberg]{.underline}** to the
Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees in April 2018, where US
lawmakers appeared confused by the social media giant's basic business
model, [is a **stark illustration** of [the **gap**]{.mark} that [still
exists between]{.mark} the world of [**Big Tech** and]{.mark} the
operating logics of **mainstream democratic
[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Stewart 2018). Bigo and Bonelli (2019,
115) have found that [even in the field of transnational
intelligence]{.underline}, a sphere that could have much to gain from
algorithmic techniques, [technological expertise tends to be
**contracted out** to third parties while **traditional**,
**human-sourced** intelligence approaches remain
**dominant**]{.underline}. Therefore, [grasping for totalising processes
risks **ignoring the empirical specificity** of divergent social
microcosms]{.underline}.

To remedy this blind side in transformationalist thinking, I assert the
utility of applying Pierre Bourdieu's field theory when conceptualising
how certain spheres of social or political activity---including the
field of global human rights advocacy discussed in the previous
section---mediate pressures for epistemic transformation and potentially
isolate technological changes and agents to the margins. Employing field
theory, Ole Jacob Sending (2015, 11) sees global governance as divided
into separate fields, where "actors compete with each other to be
recognised as authorities on what is to be governed, how, and why".
Examples of such fields include international development, security,
peacebuilding, humanitarianism, and human rights advocacy. However, each
field varies in terms of its specific "rules of the game" (Bourdieu and
Waquant 1992, 99). Fields are bounded, game-like social structures that
are constituted by a unique constellation of actors. These actors
struggle for authority according to the field's principles of
legitimation (Bourdieu 1989, 17). These principles of legitimation,
which define a field's cultural capital, are durable to the extent that
dominant actors remain invested in their reproduction. Actors' prolonged
immersion in these fields subsequently shapes their own practical
sensibilities, so that the field's logics are internalised as common
sense within the habitus (Bourdieu 1990, 53). It is the embedment of the
field's doxa (common sense) within the habitus of invested actors that
makes fields durable and resistant to radical transformations. As seen
in the previous section, the rules governing the human rights field are
associated with its logic of political influence, persuasion, and moral
authority.

Critics of Bourdieusian field theory have argued that it is overly
structuralist, reproductive, and cannot grasp "the ever-shifting
constellations of actors, institutions, data and forms of expression
that make up the expertise" (Waever and Leander 2018, 2). However,
alternative approaches such as actor-network theory or assemblage-based
theories fail to centralise the importance of social and political
struggles between agents which are key in defining the trajectory of
digitalisation and datafication. As Ruppert, Isin, and Bigo (2017, 3),
"\[d\]ata does not happen through unstructured social practices but
through structured and structuring fields in and through which various
agents and their interests generate forms of expertise, interpretation,
concepts, and methods that collectively function as fields of power and
knowledge". Similarly, "data is not an already given artefact that
exists (which then needs to be mined, analysed, brokered) but an object
of investment (in the broadest sense) that is produced by the
competitive struggles of professionals who claim stakes in its meaning
and functioning" (Bigo, Isin, and Ruppert 2019, 11). Technological
change can influence the trajectory of different global political fields
by enabling the entry of new types of actors (such as data consultants
in the case of human rights advocacy), as well as by producing emergent
sources of cultural capital and associated epistemic practices (such as
expertise in geospatial imaging).

As Bigo and Bonelli (2019, 120) have observed in the case of the
transnational intelligence field, technological change can be
accompanied by the growing influence of private companies who "have
played a substantial role in the recruitment of IT specialists, network
engineers, data analysts, integration platform software designers,
language and coding specialists, cryptologists, and mathematicians
tasked with creating or combining algorithms". Such entryism can have a
revolutionary effect if those new actors are able redefine a field's
organising logic, cultural capital, and principles of legitimation. For
example, looking at the case of Sudan in the 1990s as an antecedent to
the transformation of humanitarianism, Duffield (2018, 85) traces how
donor governments asserted greater control over NGOs, who subsequently
"seamlessly morphed into the 'implementing partners' of donor
governments". Alongside growing private sector partnerships, these
developments stimulated the neoliberal re-alignment of the humanitarian
field away from Third World solidarity and the progressive support for
autonomous change and towards the governance of precarity. This exposed
the field to an epistemic transformation that privileged datafication
based on a "surveillance logic of command and control" (ibid., 168).

However, [[**not all**]{.mark} global political [fields
are]{.mark}]{.underline} so [**structurally [conducive]{.mark}**
to]{.underline} this kind of **[radical transformation]{.underline}**.
The example of the human rights advocacy field illustrates how [a strong
autonomous organising logic]{.underline}---a logic [of
**persuasion**]{.underline}---[generates entrenched forms of
**field-specific** cultural capital]{.underline}---qualitative and
humanistic accounts of raw suffering [that establish
**clear**]{.underline} legal **[responsibilities]{.underline}**. [Actors
can **mobilise** [digital]{.mark} or data [infrastructures]{.mark} to
**[diversify]{.mark}** the range of [tools]{.mark} and media at their
disposal]{.underline}, as illustrated by the (limited) use of geospatial
technology, data visualisations in human rights reporting, and a growing
reliance on social media platforms to engage audiences. [However, they
**[do not necessarily threaten]{.mark}** the [epistemic
practices]{.mark} that are at the centre of]{.underline} human rights
**[advocacy]{.underline}**. This is because [the **[transformative
potential]{.mark}** of new technologies and methods [**depends**
on]{.mark} their]{.underline} epistemic, political, social, or moral
[[**value** in]{.mark} the eyes of the fields' **[dominant
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [integration]{.mark} of data-based
approaches [has been]{.mark} one of [**slow adaptation**, **not
revolution**]{.mark}, and technological specialists]{.underline}---often
employed as third-party consultants rather than as full-time human
rights professionals---[remain at the **margins**]{.underline}. The
Bourdieusian concept of habitus is also helpful in illuminating how
fields with strong professional structures and specific educational and
career trajectories can endow members with enduring dispositions that
favour both the reproduction of existing epistemic practices and
resistance to new ones. The habitus of human rights professionals is
still primarily defined by legal, journalistic, and liberal-cosmopolitan
moral/political dispositions, rather than technological expertise. So
long as processes of doxic reproduction remain stable, the potential for
epistemic transformation through datafication remains limited.

Conclusion

This article has cautioned against the analytical trend towards treating
datafication as a general process acting to radically transform the
epistemic and governance practices across global political fields.
[Because different social and political fields are **unique social
microcosms** that contain **divergent organising principles**, readers
should be **wary** of post-humanist analyses making **[totalising
claims]{.mark}** about alleged transformations in the human
condition]{.underline}. [The **polemical teleology** of
transformationalism]{.underline}, an approach that is in vogue among
Silicon Valley hype merchants like Elon Musk, public intellectuals, and
a growing number of social scientists, [[is]{.mark} certainly
[**attention grabbing**, but]{.mark} it [**does not measure up** against
the **actual way**]{.mark} in which [tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}
and methodological [[innovations are instituted within **different
fields**]{.mark} of practice]{.underline}. International relations and
global governance [scholars working on the interstitial cross-roads
between technology and]{.underline} various political or [social
lifeworlds need to be **attentive** to how digital and data
transformations are mediated at the meso level of **global
politics**]{.underline}. This article has demonstrated how epistemic
transformation can be resisted at the meso level through observing
changes and continuities among elite human rights organisations.
Bourdieusian field theory, with its emphasis on legitimacy, social
reproduction, and the durability of practical dispositions, offers a
suitable framework for conceptualising the absence of epistemic rupture
within the field of human rights advocacy. However, [because
digitalisation and datafication [processes are mediated through]{.mark}
the [**specific logics** of a given field]{.mark}]{.underline}, more
work needs to be done on examining how different organising principles
shape the potentialities for epistemic transformation. Thus, in the
future, more [[**comparative empirical research** will be needed]{.mark}
to observe technological changes [across **different areas**]{.mark} of
global governance]{.underline}.

**Hook, 21**---Associate Professor of Psychology at Duquesne University
(Derek, "Pilfered pleasure: on racism as "the theft of enjoyment","
*Lacan and Race: Racism, Identity, and Psychoanalytic Theory*, Chapter
2, pg 36-39, dml)

[What is]{.underline} immediately **[striking]{.underline}** in these
extracts [is the role played by **affect**]{.underline}, or more
accurately yet, by [the]{.underline} "**[pained
stimulation]{.underline}**" [of]{.underline} the aroused passions of
**[enjoyment]{.underline}**. What both authors highlight---and this
speaks to the analytical value of the concept---is that forms of excess
stimulation (the "negative pleasure" of jouissance) underlie and propel
Symbolic and political constructions of otherness. Different cultural
modes of enjoyment are, furthermore, fundamentally discordant. [We
have]{.underline} then not so much a "Clash of Civilizations"---to
reference the Samuel Huntington's (1997) much cited thesis---as [a
**clash** of enjoyments]{.underline}.

Moreover, [the difficulty that we have in realizing]{.underline} "full"
[enjoyment]{.underline}---something that is impossible in Lacanian
theory for "castrated" speaking beings---[is dealt with by imagining the
**supposedly unimpaired** and **inevitably disturbing enjoyment**
possessed by]{.underline} cultural/racial/sexual
**[others]{.underline}**. In short, the fact that we cannot attain the
jouissance we feel we deserve results in perceptions of an unhindered,
illegitimate, and undeserved enjoyment on the part of others. As Sheldon
George notes: "the other's jouissance, or enjoyment, \[is\] ... the very
core around which ... otherness articulates itself" (2016: 3). Political
jealousy, as Žižek calls it, is thus (at least in part) the result of
incompatibilities and more importantly yet, perceived sacrifices of
jouissance.

Jouissance: unserviceable tool of political analysis?

Despite having offered only a brief introduction to the above Lacanian
ideas, [[we should **pause**]{.underline}]{.mark} here for a moment [[to
voice a number of]{.underline}]{.mark} prospective [**methodological**
and **conceptual [problems]{.mark}** implied [by the racism
as]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[theft of]{.underline}**) [[**enjoyment**
thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Doing so will help us focus the expository
comments to follow, and indeed, to highlight the potential analytical
advantages the thesis may have to offer.

The first critique, which applies to a wide historical range of
psychoanalytic theories of racism (see Cohen, 2002; Frosh 1989;
Stavrakis 1999), is that of psychological reductionism. Simply put: [the
[**complexity** of]{.mark} the various
**[historical]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[discursive]{.underline}**,
[and **socioeconomic causes**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of racism [are
**invariably deprioritized**]{.mark} and accorded a **peripheral
explanatory** role once [the]{.mark} domain of the [**psychological** is
**privileged**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Accounts]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
the psychological factors underlying various instances of racism
[are]{.mark} thus not only [**de-historicizing** and]{.mark}
**hopelessly [generalizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [they are also
**invariably depoliticizing**]{.underline}.

A second critique: [[is jouissance not]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[hopelessly [open-ended]{.mark}]{.underline}** concept? [Virtually
**any cultural behaviour**]{.underline}, [**bodily intensity** or
**[libidinal activity]{.mark}** can]{.underline}, it seems, [be
considered]{.underline} to be [an instance of jouissance]{.underline}.
[In view of racism]{.underline}, for example, [the other's enjoyment can
[refer to **everything** from]{.mark}]{.underline} their
incomprehensible **[[cultur]{.mark}al customs]{.underline}** and/or
**[religious beliefs]{.underline}** (epitomized, for example, in odd
food and dress restrictions), [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} perceived
aspects of their distinctive
[physicality]{.underline}/[sensuality]{.underline} (their
**[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the way they
**[[dance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the sound of their
**[[music]{.underline}]{.mark}**), to attributions of superabundant
vitality (they are excessively promiscuous, religious, lazy, etc.)? [The
concept]{.underline} of jouissance [seems]{.underline} thus to be [both
**underdifferentiated** and **overly inclusive**]{.underline}, [applying
to a **potentially endless array** of behaviors and
experiences]{.underline}. [Without a **clearer sense** of how to
differentiate what **qualifies** as enjoyment and what does
**not**]{.underline}, [the concept **[loses analytical
value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A third line of critique: [**different modes** of enjoyment are
implied]{.underline} within the literature, [without being **properly
distinguished**]{.underline}. In Žižek's descriptions of racism and
jouissance, for example, [jouissance is used **broadly** to refer
to]{.underline}: [**visceral** or **passionate** modes of
experience]{.underline} (the "thrill of **[hate]{.underline}**"); an
[array of **enviable possessions**]{.underline} (our "**[libidinal
treasures]{.underline}**") perceived as under threat by cultural others;
[and]{.underline} a type of noxious "**[surplus vitality]{.underline}**"
possessed by such others. So, [whose enjoyment are we **most
fundamentally concerned** with]{.underline} in these notions of racism
as jouissance, the other's, or our own? What is the relationship between
these two types of jouissance? And how are they related to a third mode,
namely the "negative pleasure" of making---experiencing---such troubling
attributions in the first place?

Fourth, there is ever-present problem of
[de-contextualization]{.underline} in "shorthand" applications of the
term. This [leads to a situation in which enjoyment]{.underline} itself
[is treated as a **causative force beyond adequate consideration**
of]{.underline} a series of accompanying concepts (the frame of fantasy,
the operation of the signifier, [the [role of]{.mark} the
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the "object a" as cause of desire) that
necessarily accompany its proper psychoanalytic application. What
[**auxiliary terms** [must]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[be
utilized]{.mark} alongside the concept if it is to serve us [as a
**viable**]{.mark} **analytical [tool]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

Critique 1: the notion of enjoyment as psychologically reductionist

There is a crucial passage that is repeated in a number of Žižek's
earlier books (1992, 1993, 2005) and that serves as perhaps his most
direct exposition of racism as the theft of enjoyment:

What is at stake in ethnic tensions is always \[a kind of \] possession:
the "other" wants to steal our enjoyment (by ruining our "way of life")
and/ or he has access to some secret, perverse enjoyment. In short, what
gets on our nerves, what really bothers us about the "other" is the
peculiar way he organizes his enjoyment (the smell of his food, his
"noisy" songs and dances, his strange manners, his attitudes to
work---in the racist perspective, the "other" is either a workaholic
stealing our jobs or an idler living on our labour)" (1992: 165).

While this seems, in many ways, a gripping account, from a sociologist
or historian's perspective[, the [degree of reductionism is
**staggering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The **[multiple [complex]{.mark}
sociological]{.underline}**, **[economic]{.underline}**, [and
**socio-historical [variables]{.mark}** underlying distinctive
historical forms of racism [are **brushed aside** in favor of]{.mark} a
**[generalizing psychoanalytic formula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Racism =
reaction to perception that the]{.underline} (perversely enjoying)
[other has stolen our enjoyment]{.underline}. This reduction of racism
to an affective equation is evident also in Žižek's precursor in this
conceptual domain, Jacques-Alain Miller:

Why does the Other remain Other? What is the cause for our hatred of
him, for our hatred of him in his very being? It is hatred of the
enjoyment in the Other. This would be the most general formula for the
modern racism we are witnessing today: a hatred of a particular way the
Other enjoys ... The question of tolerance or intolerance is ... located
on the level of tolerance or intolerance toward the enjoyment of the
Other, the Other who essentially steals my own enjoyment (Miller, cited
in Žižek 1993: 203).

[The **depoliticization**]{.underline} (indeed, the implicit
psychologization) [inherent in such a conceptual move is
**surprising**]{.underline} inasmuch it is something that Žižek has
proved critical of elsewhere. In a 1998 text, for example, Žižek
outlines the charge of psychological reductionism against standard
[psychoanalytic explanations of racism]{.underline}, which offer

a way of explaining racism that **[ignore]{.underline}** ... [not only
racism's **socioeconomic conditions** but the **sociosymbolic context**
of cultural values and identifications]{.underline} that generate
reactions to the experience of ethnic otherness (1988: 154).

Surely this also applies to the racism as theft of enjoyment formula
outlined above? [[Explanations]{.mark} of racism as jouissance
are]{.underline} surely [prone to **psychological
reductionism**]{.underline} inasmuch as [they]{.underline} often appear
to [[privilege]{.mark} a series of [psychoanalytic
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[drive]{.underline}**,
**[fantasy]{.underline}**, [**[libido]{.underline}**,
**[projection]{.underline}**]{.mark}, etc.) [as existing **prior**
to]{.underline}---[or [**independently**
of]{.mark}]{.underline}---[considerations of
**[economic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[historical]{.underline}**,
**[political]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and **socio-symbolic
[context]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

#### Presenting a [strategy]{.underline} to solve [suffering]{.underline} isn't [voyeurism]{.underline}.

**Craps '12** \[Steph; 2012; Professor of English at Ghent University,
Director of Centre for Literature and Trauma; *Postcolonial Witnessing:
Trauma Out of Bounds*, *Palgrave*, "Conclusion," p. 126-127; GR\]

Cogent though these various critiques are in their own terms, it seems
to me that they unduly homogenize and simplify different forms of
interest in and inquiry into trauma. While it is true, of course, that
trauma research does not in and of itself lead to political
transformation, I would argue that a **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**
theory revised along the lines I have suggested [[is not]{.mark}
destined to serve as the handmaiden of the status quo or [a]{.mark} mere
academic [**alibi** for]{.mark} the indulgence of **[voyeuristic
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it can]{.mark}
help identify and [understand]{.mark} situations of
**[exploitation]{.mark} and abuse**[, and act as]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} the kind of sustained and systemic [critique
of]{.mark} **societal [conditions]{.mark}** called for by Berlant and
Brown]{.underline}. In fact, [the expanded **model of [trauma]{.mark}**
I have proposed, [based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the work of Laura Brown,
Frantz [**[Fanon]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} others, bears a close
resemblance to the model of suffering that [Berlant [puts
forward]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[an
**alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} to the (traditional) trauma
model, which she finds inadequate: \"[a model of suffering, whose
etymological [articulation of **pain**]{.mark} and patience [draws its
**subject** less as an **effect** of]{.mark} an act of [**violence** and
more as]{.mark} an effect of [a]{.mark} **general [atmosphere]{.mark}**
[of it, peppered by **acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be sure, but not
contained by the presumption that trauma carries, that it is an effect
of a single scene of violence or toxic taxonomy\" (338). Berlant\'s
observation that \"the pain and suffering of subordinated subjects in
everyday life is an ordinary and ongoing thing that is underdescribed by
the (traumatic) identity form and its circulation in the state and the
law\" (344) is perfectly in line with the argument I have presented in
this book.

[That **trauma [research]{.mark}** [can act as a **catalyst**
for]{.mark} astute **[political]{.mark} analysis** and **meaningful
[activism]{.mark}**]{.underline} would seem to be borne out by the \[END
PAGE 126\] development in Fanon\'s writing, from Black Skin, White
Masks, which describes the psychological impact of racial and colonial
oppression, to the overtly political The Wretched of the Earth, which
confronts the source of the mental strife he saw in the clinic.3 Since
Douglas Crimp\'s plea for \"\[m\]ilitancy, of course, then, but mourning
too: mourning and militancy\" (18) in relation to the AIDS movement back
in 1989, several scholars have argued that an interest in issues of
[trauma, loss, and mourning is in fact compatible with a commitment to
radical activism. A desire [to make **visible** the]{.mark} creative and
[**political**-rather than **pathological**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
negative-aspects of an [**attachment** to loss]{.mark}]{.underline} is
the thread that binds together the essays gathered in David Eng and
David Kazanjian\'s volume Loss: The Politics of Mourning (2003), which
seeks to \"extend\[\] recent scholarship in trauma studies by insisting
that ruptures of experience, witnessing, history, and truth are, indeed,
a starting point for political activism and transformation\" (10). Eng
and Kazanjian see their collection as moving \"from trauma to prophecy,
and from epistemological structures of unknowability to the politics of
mourning\" (10). As one of the contributors, Ann Cvetkovich, puts it,
[trauma can be \"the provocation [to create]{.mark} **alternative
[lifeworld's]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (\"Legacies of Trauma\" 453).

[Recognition of suffering serves as [a]{.mark} **necessary first
[step]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards the [amelioration]{.mark} of that
suffering]{.underline}. In Judith Butler\'s words, \"The recognition of
[**shared [precariousness]{.mark}** [introduces]{.mark} strong
[normative]{.mark} commitments of [equality]{.mark} and invites a more
robust universalizing of rights that seeks [to address basic]{.mark}
**human [needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for food, shelter, and other
conditions for persisting and flourishing\" (28-29). Without wishing to
overstate its likely impact, I believe that rethinking trauma studies
from a postcolonial perspective and providing nuanced readings of a wide
variety of narratives of trauma and witnessing from around the world can
help us understand that shared precariousness. By fostering attunement
to previously unheard suffering and putting into global circulation
memories of a broad range of traumatic histories, an inclusive and
culturally sensitive trauma theory can assist in [raising awareness of
injustice]{.underline} both past and present [and opening up the
possibility of a more just global future]{.underline}-and, in so doing,
remain faithful to the ethical foundations of the field.5

or metaphysical [[referents]{.underline}]{.mark} and a terrain of
power\'s irreducible and pervasive ce in human affairs. [[Contrary to

[[practices: for **Truth**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(**[[unchanging]{.underline}]{.mark}**, incontestable) **[[over

adjudicating for themselves and their future on the basis of nothing
more than their own habits and arguments.[This]{.underline} particular
modernist reaction to postmoder- nism [makes sense if we recall
that]{.underline} the promise of [the **Enlightenment** was
a]{.underline} revision of the old [**Platonic** promise to put an end
to politics by supplanting it with Truth]{.underline}. In its modern
variant, this promise was tendered through the multiple technologies of
nature\'s rationality in human affairs (Adam Smith); science, including
the science of administration (Hobbes); and universal reason (Kant.
Hegel. Marx). Modernity could not make good on this promise, of course,
but modernists do not surrender the dream it instilled of a world
governed by reason divested of power.\*\*• Avowed ambivalence about

the Gathering of Black Sociality." Black Camera 8(2): 120-36. Emory

Arthur Jafa\'s 2013 essay film Dreams are colder than Death begins as a
lyrical meditation on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.\'s \"I have a
dream\" speech conducted through interviews with African-American
intellectuals---the specialists, as Jafa calls them---such as Hortense
Spillers, Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Nicole Fleetwood; filmmaker
Charles Burnett; ex--Black Panther and professor Kathleen Clever;
musician Flying Lotus; and visual artists Kara Walker and Wangechi Mutu,
among others.1 Quickly, however, the film detours toward more
fundamental and open-ended questions, \[End Page 120\] such as \"What is
the concept of blackness? Where did it come from? And what does it mean
for people of color living in America today?\"

Weaving together lyrical slow-motion images of black people---the
uncommon folks---mostly in outdoor spaces hanging out, walking around,
or talking to one another, with images of dark waters or deep space, the
film creates a tapestry within which the voices of some of the most
powerful contemporary black artists and thinkers engage in a meditation
on the ontology of blackness and its relationship to life, death, and
the concept of the human in the context of the \"afterlife of
slavery.\"2

[[That]{.mark} the social existence of [blackness has to be understood
within]{.mark} the context of [the]{.mark} \"[afterlife of
slavery]{.mark}\" [is]{.mark} the position [held by]{.mark} scholars
that identify with the conversation described as
[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline},3 [[while the ascendance of]{.mark}
the \#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter movement, [founded
by]{.mark} three **[queer women]{.mark}**---Alicia Garza, Patrisse
Cullors, and Opal Tometi---can be seen to [**vindicate** the
\"**Afro-Optimist**\" position that affirms]{.mark} instead [the]{.mark}
primacy, vibrancy, and [generative capacity of black social
life]{.mark}.]{.underline}4

To be sure, this opposition stands more strongly in the eyes of critics
of Afro-Pessimism than those of its supporters, as Jared Sexton has
recently articulated in his article \"Afro-Pessimism: The Unclear
Word,\" where he describes Afro-Pessimism as an ars vita \"because it
emerges from within a global catastrophe so total that the creation or
production of a black poetry, a black art, a stylization of the black
body, a black sense of place cannot but be invented wholesale \[. . .\]
without a future promising anything different or, rather, better.\"5 In
what, to date, is the most explicit alignment of the goals of
Afro-Pessimism with those of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the
overarching question Afro-Pessimism, as an art vita, poses then becomes,
\"How do we create a world where black lives matter, to everyone or,
rather, to everyone else as well? What economies---political, libidinal,
symbolic---must be destroyed or negated, what others forged or
affirmed?\"6

The film addresses this issue through the words of [Moten]{.underline},
who [asks]{.underline}, [\"[When you say that black people are just an
effect of slavery you raise a question:]{.mark}]{.underline} can black
people be loved? Not desired, not wanted, not acquired, not lusted after
. . . [[can blackness be loved?]{.mark}\"]{.underline} By posing this
question, especially in the current context within which the intimacy
between blackness and death has become increasingly obscenely clear, the
film holds these apparent opposites in suspension.7

This essay reads Dreams as the aesthetic articulation of the fact of
black love. The film\'s structure, I argue, effectively performs the
very [[networks of solidarity]{.mark}, grief, [and grievance]{.mark}
that [are]{.mark} some of the [goals of]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter]{.underline}.8 In other
words, my reading finds in the film\'s edits---which I approach as
passages, as I will explain below---the expression of its own
[[balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} act between the commemoration of a
speech so closely associated with [**[fantasies of
equality]{.underline}**]{.mark} and freedom, and the philosophical and
artistic decision to frame \[End Page 121\] it through the concept of
death.9 In other words, the decision is to approach all this **[[from
the midst of an ongoing genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a place [where
the dream has given way to the coldness of an endless
deferral]{.underline}, to the solitude of a corpse abandoned too long in
the middle of the street.10

The film holds these two poles in balance while reflecting on their
implications: on the one hand, the recognition, as Spillers puts it in
the film, that slavery is such a powerful and huge phenomenon that in
some ways it is still present---a statement we hear over an image of
dark waters---and, on the other hand, the repeated association of
blackness with images of galaxies and deep space, which, instead, affirm
its life-giving force and cosmic reach. Through its aesthetic
\"liquidity\"---i.e., the way in which it enacts unobstructed and yet
unprecedented \"passages\" between seemingly disparate and incongruous
concepts and situations, as well as the facility with which it travels
across scale, from the molecular to the celestial---the film connects
experiences of personal grief to the expression of grievance, to
reflections on the challenges blackness poses to the conception of the
human subject and her freedom. It performs, in other words, what Sexton
describes as a series of conceptual moves \"from the empirical to the
structural or, more precisely, from the experiential to the political
ontological.\"11

One methodological premise of this essay is that the film\'s edits have
to be regarded as types of passages, that is, as very similar, at least
in spirit, to those L.A. Rebellion filmmaker Larry Clark adopted in his
film Passing Through (1977). For years, Jafa has been \"obsessed\" about
this cult film that, by many accounts, has successfully transposed the
compositional principles of jazz improvisation into filmmaking and thus
reached a powerful synergy between free jazz and film form.12 In his
work, Clark leverages the adventurous expansiveness of free jazz to
connect, and therefore pass through, a variety of seemingly incongruous
or remote spaces, making adjacent, for example, sites of artistic
improvisation and sites of systemic oppression, spaces of addiction and
spaces of healing, the US racial scene and Third World revolutionary
struggles. These very passages, which Jafa has carefully studied since
his time at Howard University, which had purchased a print of the film
through his mentor Haile Gerima, are precisely what joins so essentially
the aesthetics and politics of the film. They also stand as testimony
that [blackness requires incredibly capacious frameworks to gather and
comprehend its audacious transitions.]{.underline}

Thus, methodologically speaking, this essay interprets the film\'s
editing structure---beautifully executed by Dreams\' producer and editor
Kahlil Joseph---and, in particular, the elements that the film posits as
adjacent, as indices of [[the network of love and care that]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter also [seeks]{.mark} to
establish as a way to [counteract state-sanctioned antiblack
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The balance that Dreams performs between the thinking of life and the
thinking of death is also attained by the particular way in which the
film \[End Page 122\] dislodges some of the very conditions for black
surveillance by having voices disjointed from bodies, faces made hardly
legible because shot against intense natural light sources and a
pervasive use of slow motion that creates a sense of another space, an
alternative---perhaps suspended---dimension, and different sets of
expectations and constraints, within which black bodies can move at
their own chosen pace.13

This image/sound disjunction, whereby the interviewees\' voices are
strategically recorded independently from the image, establishes its own
passages connecting otherwise distant or disparate things, including the
passage from the \"particular universal\" of the queer identities of
#BlackLivesMatter\'s founders to the capaciously collective (\"All Black
Lives Matter\" is the claim on their website) and, by extension \"all
people,\" which is one of the main guiding ideas of the
#BlackLivesMatter movement.14 It is in this way, I will show, that the
film claims for blackness an expansiveness and intelligence that reaches
across space and time and therefore can be seen to attain its own
"fugitivity," a line of escape, as [Moten describes]{.underline} it, [an
optimistic thinking \"on the run,\"]{.underline} rendered here, in
Melissa Louidor\'s words, as [a \"mobilization of Black
vitality]{.underline}, in which biomechanic and metaphysical forces are
deployed to activate effort; an effort that is [[integral to claiming
survival.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}15

Dis-joining and Re-joining

The study of filmic movement and sound has been a central preoccupation
for Jafa since his collaboration with Julie Dash in Daughters of the
Dust (1991). For years he researched ways to bring \"intonation and
inclination down to actual movement\" and to manipulate motion in
concordance with black people\'s handshakes---that is, to find a
different integrity and comfort or ease between black sound and black
body, black image and black motion.16 For this film, he decided to
record the sound of the interviews separately from their images, which
are consistently overexposed or shot at oddly tilted and unusual angles,
or in extreme close-up, so that the faces might be present but not
necessarily legible, and legibility quickly becomes irrelevant anyway
(fig. 1).

There are two main reasons for this choice. First, the decision not to
use direct sound in his practice came in part as a matter of production
circumstances. Early on, after his experience on the set of Charles
Burnett\'s My Brother\'s Wedding (1983), shot on location in Watts, Jafa
realized that if he wanted to film in black neighborhoods, he would have
to add sound in post-production: as he explained, black neighborhoods
have all kinds of environmental noises that cannot be put on hold. He
adopted this practice because of his commitment to working on location,
with nonprofessional actors, to cast against (the industrial) grain, on
the footsteps of neorealist filmmakers. \[End Page 123\]

At the same time, Jafa\'s decision about sound recording performs a
powerful critique of the problem of forced coherence between black voice
and black body that has been a staple of the film industry since
Hollywood\'s transition to sound.17 This is what he has attempted to
reproduce by casting from the streets: for example, the possibility to
choose on the basis of people\'s natural movements and then pair them in
postproduction with someone whose voice has the right sound. This
affords the possibility to combine various voices to produce transgender
sounds, ultimately, as he describes it, to take the same liberties with
sound and voice that black musicians have historically taken with their
music. In many ways, this is a particularly \"black move\" in the sense
that this disarticulation of image and sound performs a critique of the
very properties of self-possession that constitute \"the existential
issue for Black Americans.\"18

While, on the one hand, as Kahlil Joseph also confirmed, separate sound
recording creates a different comfort zone where people can speak
freely, without being policed by the camera, it also affords a different
rendering of aural style in the sense that ultimately the sound of what
one says, as well as the posture and movements that go with it, might
have a deeper stylistic mark than the specific content of what is being
said.19 Movement, including the movement induced by editing, in other
words, might attempt to translate a speaking style, or the sound design
might strive to render the texture of a stroll, and so on.

To push this strategic disconnection and reconnection between sound and
image even further, at some point the interviewers---i.e., Jafa or Greg
\[End Page 124\] Tate---asked the interviewees what were the things they
truly believed. Recorded independently from the image, the interviewees
express themselves rather freely. As a result, the film is punctuated
with exceptionally powerful statements---\" I know that . . . I know
that\"---one of which opens the film. This knowledge, the film argues,
is a combination of knowing, feeling, and believing; it is ultimately
what Moten describes as a type of knowing \"under the rubric of faith,\"
which he considers to be the theological component of Black Studies.
Even more profoundly, this knowledge is the expression of a \"thinking
\[that is\] irreducible in blackness,\" a statement that is overlaid to
the image of a filament spectacularly detaching from the sun (fig. 2).

Black Flesh

The film opens with a quasi-still and fairly flat image of a young man
slowly turning his head right to left while also looking into the
camera, as Spillers\'s voice is heard making a commanding and
unconditional assertion: \"I know that.\" Her voice continues over the
image of a backward movement: we see young men somersaulting out of
(instead of into) a swimming pool in slow motion, their bodies remaining
temporarily suspended in midair: \"We are going to lose this gift of
black culture unless we are careful,\" she elaborates, \"this gift that
is given to people who don\'t have a prayer.\" Her \[End Page 125\]
voice screeches for emphasis around the word \"prayer\" and is cued to
the frozen close-up of one of the young men in the pool who looks
intensely at the camera (fig. 3). \[End Page 126\]

Juxtaposed to two lynching images, Spillers\'s in Selma voice continues:
\"beat our skins off our bodies; kill and rape our mamas in front of
us.\" As she repeats for the last time that \"we didn\'t have a
prayer,\" the film\'s first \"abstract\" image appears, possibly the
picture of a molecular structure, with clearly visible filaments and
small translucent masses; it is an image enigmatic enough that it
suggests a dimension blackness possesses that does not necessarily
belong to the phenomenological world but rather expands unbound across
scale (fig. 4).

Spillers continues over slow motion images of people walking down the
street:

Now we are heads of international courts, President of the United
States, we sit in the United States Supreme Court, Presidents of
Universities, CEO of American Express. . . . Some black person is it.

But the price of that is to lose this precious insight that connects you
to something human and bigger than white folks---I don\'t give a fuck
what color the folk---something bigger than that.

We are losing that connection because we are buying this other shit.

\"I know that. I know that,\" she concludes over increasingly hazy
images of semi-opaque glass panes at dusk, as the camera is looking onto
trees and green outside (fig 5).

Here transparency is blocked in favor of an emphasis, not on the haptic
properties of these images, but rather on their \"intransitive\"
character---they \[End Page 127\] don\'t convey any clear and readable
relation to what she is saying, they don\'t lead anywhere else---so that
they can also be \"arresting\" and create a moment of philosophical
suspension.

After a fade to black, one of the filmmakers explains in voice-over how
Dreams began as an assessment of \"the roles and ambitions of the Civil
Rights Movement in the United States,\" fifty years after Martin Luther
King Jr.\'s speech to gather \"thoughts and conversations of an America
that is rarely heard.\" These words unfold over two images of deep space
and a close-up of colorful light reflections on dark waters that show
all the chroma of the visible spectrum, as if slipping into blackness
and back to color, from color into blackness. (fig. 6).

The voice-over continues:

\"In the process the filmmakers discovered even a more fundamental set
of questions: What is the concept of blackness? Where did it come from?
And what does it mean for people of color living in America today?\" The
last question is posed over the image of a black star-child that fades
into the title, Dreams are colder than Death, while the sound design
bears an outer-space quality reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (dir.
Stanley Kubrick, 1969).

This transition embodies the connection with something bigger that
Spillers described earlier. It is also steeped in Jafa\'s admiration for
Stanley Kubrick\'s film, which he saw when he was ten and which provided
him with \"a model for how powerful art could be.\"20 Despite being
initially utterly puzzled by 2001, he eventually understood his
fascination with the \"glacial pageantry\" of the film in part because a
\"nascent melancholy\" emerged as he began to recognize \"categorical
constraints\" dictated by his blackness. Yet, he also registered the
\"transfixing\" and \"unprecedented blackness\" of the inhabitants of
the Mississippi Delta region where he grew up, including their \[End
Page 128\] \"arresting beauty and dense corporeal being,\" which he
ultimately described as \"the dark matter of black being.\"21 In this
context, he read 2001\'s horror vacui as animated by a profound fear of
\"black being contaminating white being, which, by the very nature of
the self-imposed fragile ontological construction of white being, equals
the annihilation of white being.\"22

Yet, what happens when the dark matter of black being, rather than the
atavistic whiteness of 2001, is placed at the center of the textual
system?23

One way Jafa attempts this radical recalibration is through Spillers\'s
influential notion of the flesh. She discusses how her sister was
subjected to a partial amputation and yet continued to feel an
excruciating pain in her phantom leg, as if her pain remembered, so to
speak, the part of the leg that was no longer there. She calls this
\"flesh memory\" in a manner that echoes Elizabeth Alexander\'s argument
in her article \"Can You Be Black and Look at This?,\" that is, the idea
that there is a bodily archive of practical memory that is reactivated
at the moment of collective spectatorship of the black body in pain.24
For Spillers, the flesh results from the \"theft of the body\" that
occurs in the Middle Passage.25 It is also a way to describe, as
Alexander Weheliye has done, the ungendering inscription of domination
onto the biopolitical dimension of the slave body as well as the
slave\'s availability as raw material.26

\"We were available in the flesh to the slave master,\" her voice-over
explains, \"immediate; hands on,\" and these words are layered over a
slowmotion image of a woman crossing the street. \"I can pluck your
nappy head from wherever it is. Bang!,\" Spillers continues. The sound
of her \"Bang!\" is cued to the image of the same woman, who now turns
in slow motion toward the camera with a puzzled and inquisitive look, as
if reacting to Spillers\'s mimicked slap (fig. 7). \[End Page 129\]

\"How many kids you have here? Bang! Bang!\" Spillers continues.

This layering establishes a call-and-response between the scholar\'s
voice and the \"uncommon people\" it is laid over by moving through the
\"passage\" that this very layering produces and toward **[[the
experience of the flesh as a source of empathy]{.mark}; it also
[reinforces the]{.mark} very [connection that Spillers worries might be
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Not only does the empathy of the flesh, as rendered here, vividly
materialize the network of solidarity, grief, and grievance that
#BlackLivesMatter supports, but it locates it within a cosmic
context]{.underline}. As Spillers introduces the concept of empathy, the
film transitions from a close shot of her face temporarily obscured by
foliage as she is walking under a tree, to a shot of the word \"TERROR\"
carved on a black man\'s chest---a quite literal representation of
Spiller\'s concept of the \"hieroglyphics of the flesh\"---to an image
of the Centaurus galaxy. [The flesh here is what binds people who
slavery deprived of their \"body,\" and yet, this passage suggests, it
is also, possibly, cosmic black matter]{.underline}.

The Dark Matter of Black Being

Key to Jafa\'s understanding of the \"dark matter of black being\" in
2001 is the fact that the monolith is a sentient black object, although
its blackness, as well as its perfectly smooth and polished modernist
surface, might ultimately obscure this very sentience.27 In Christina
Sharpe\'s words, black sentience, just like black pain, is
\"anagrammatical blackness,\" an \"index of violability,\" which also
means, as Calvin Warren explains, that the metaphysical violences
directed at black lives \"are indecipherable because they constitute a
non-sense sign within the grammar of redress and humanism.\" While
unreadable to the outside, they are affectively felt, where affect
provides \"form for an experience anti-blackness places outside
ethics.\"28 Drawing on Hortense Spillers\'s field-defining essay
\"Mama\'s Baby, Papa\'s Maybe: An American Grammar Book,\" one of the
issues both Afro-Pessimism and #BlackLivesMatter insist on is the need
to find an appropriate grammar for black pain. If \"suffering,\" as
Sexton puts it, is a \"simple enough term for withstanding the ugliness
of the world---and learning from it---\[then\] Afro-Pessimism is, among
other things, an attempt to formulate an account of such suffering, to
establish the rules of its grammar.\"29

Black sentience and suffering are appropriate \"black matter\" for the
type of knowledge and flesh memory on which Dreams insists. Saidiya
Hartman, for example, shares her relationship with premature death: how
she knows too many people who died young, including all the guys she had
crushes on in her youth. Similarly, she knows her life could end at any
\[End Page 130\] minute because of an act of gratuitous violence. The
social existence of blackness, she says, is one of \"intimacy with
death.\"30 Yet images of human suffering in the film are all historical
rather than contemporary, and even this latter statement happens in
conjunction with an image of a mother and three girls absorbed in their
own thoughts, walking in slow motion toward the camera (fig. 8).

Horizontal passages such as this one register as assertions of the equal
preciousness, and equal enigma, of all black lives. They establish
affective links and therefore enact what Sharpe might call \"wake work\"
and which Warren would describe as \"black care.\"

At the same time, and overall, they can be seen as a form of gathering
in a way that stages also the \"Thingness of blackness\" in the
Heideggerian sense that Moten follows in his essay \"The Case of
Blackness.\" There, he claims for blackness that status of Thing, a
\"gathering as contested matter\"---both Sache, that is, gathering, and
Ding, that is, the \"matter under discussion\"---a thingness that pours
out of the object, and, like troubled air, escapes from its vestibule.
This \"breath,\" he argues, this outflowing of \"stolen life,\"
describes the ontological vitality of blackness---its unbound and
ungraspable Thingness---as a constitutive and dangerous supplementarity,
a \"transplanted organ, always eliciting rejection.\"31

This type of gathering, as Sarah Cervenak similarly writes in her
reading of Leonardo Drew\'s sculptures, \"ceremoniously aestheticizes
rejectable life, making way for the im/proper regard of its
unencroachable (always \[End Page 131\] unfigurable) value.\"32 Thus, in
this gathering of the \"dark matter of black being\" across scale---from
the microscopic to the cosmic---as well as horizontally, Dreams too
institutes the [[networks of care]{.mark} that [transform]{.mark}
\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter [from a concept to a
movement]{.mark}, insofar as [in their]{.mark} very [gathering, black
lives acquire \"the weightedness of being]{.mark}]{.underline} \[which\]
comes through precisely through a kind of deregulated togetherness.\"33

Indeed, structurally speaking, the film can be regarded as an archival
\"gathering\" of still and moving images---both archival and
contemporary images, found and original, recognizable and
unrecognizable---[[which include]{.mark} footage of the interviewees as
well as other [people]{.mark} who are not named, [whose connection to
the speaking voices is not known]{.mark}]{.underline} and cannot be
guessed.

The film features a number of still images that also appear on
APEX_TNEG, a \"proof of concept\" piece, originally developed with Malik
Sayeed, in which still images quickly flash by in a variety of different
orders and combinations. Jafa has modified this montage several times
over the years, and it follows rather closely Jafa\'s \"collecting\"
practice and his sense that individual elements acquire a measure of
additional density just by virtue of being gathered together.34

A great part of the film\'s gathering occurs in the \"bosom\" of the
cosmos itself. When Rich Blint asks, \"How do you know that you are free
without captivity?\" his question is posed over a stunning image of
Saturn\'s moon Dione (fig. 9).35 \[End Page 132\]

The image of the NGC 3621 Galaxy shown while Nicole Fleetwood explains
that \"there is something unique about black expressive culture\" also
underscores this dimension. We can say that anagrammatical blackness
reappears here but this time as an index of potentiality, \"blackness
anew, blackness as a/temporal, in and out of place and time putting
pressure on meaning and that against which meaning is made.\"36 More
specifically, this Galaxy is believed to have a system of three black
holes at its center, one of which is active and swallows matter while
producing radiation.37

Fleetwood explains that she was raised with a working-class black female
religious sensibility, and that, at the church where her grandmother was
the music director, it was music, and not the sermon, that would drive
the service. Indeed, music acted as a mechanism capable of generating
energy. Her words are laid over images in part inspired by Hart Leroy
Bibbs\'s Manifesto Optksorption, a 1977 collection of poems and
long-exposure photographs of jazz musicians as they are playing. The
traces of the musicians\' movements linger around their figures as
squiggles of light that blur the figures\' contours, arguably one of the
closest photographic counterparts to the \"intensities\" that traverse
Francis Bacon\'s paintings, which Deleuze discussed to illustrate the
\"logic of sensation\" (fig. 10).38

Jafa knows Bibbs\'s work, and he too has been making similar images
because he is equally invested in the energizing and expansive intensity
of black music. A similar jazz image comes back during Moten\'s
discussion of blackness as a critique of ownership and of the proper.
\"We have been placed in a position that requires us to break the law,
to disobey,\" Moten explains, and \[End Page 133\] thus blackness
displays an irreducible relation between law making and law breaking,
legality and criminality. Not contingently, but historically: during
slavery, he elaborates, black gathering was illegal. Yet this also means
that blackness is involved in a jurisgenerative process whereby formal
innovations are necessarily types of lawbreaking (while lawbreaking
might also always conduce to formal innovation). What Miles Davis and
John Coltrane were doing, he elaborates, was to break the very rules
that they had established the night before, while their improvisatory
acts performed a disruption of both property and propriety.

There are no imaginable circumstances within which #BlackLivesMatter
could make a similar claim. In the discourses and practices in which it
intervenes, where \"white safety equals black murder,\" criminality does
not have a philosophical meaning, but it is rather the overarching
framing within which blackness is seen to operate, before and regardless
of any actions actually taken.39 Yet, Moten and Harney insist, in an
essay devoted to Michael Brown, \"If we refuse to show the image of a
lonely body, of the outline of the space that body simultaneously took
and left, we do so in order to imagine jurisgenerative black social life
walking down the middle of the street---for a minute, but only for a
minute, unpoliced, another city gathers, dancing.\"40

Mattering Blackness

Filling the frame in extreme close-up, and barely emerging into
visibility, silhouette artist Kara Walker rubs her eyes.

\"When I work . . . I find myself in this kind schism, in this kind of
mercurial space, that is sort of non-gendered and non-raced,\" she says
over some of her most famous silhouette installations. \"My skin keeps
trying to stick itself back on. . . . I become aware of the skin and
everything that comes with it. . . . And then it comes detached, only
slightly, not all the way.\" Now an extreme close-up of her lips
occupies the left side of the frame. \"I am getting this image of
retinal detachment. The skin is literally folding away and it\'s gory
and grotesque and that\'s where I feel like when I am at home.\" Seen in
extreme close-up now, her eyelid occupies the right side of the frame
(fig. 11).

\"It is not a safe place to be,\" she continues, \"but one where you can
kind of look at the underside of race . . . what is being escaped
from.\" She proceeds: \"What is this existential horror that one can
feel about being kind of invisible . . . being kind of a heavy presence
/ a heavy non-presence?\" It is a question heard over an image of waves
hitting a shore dotted with black rocks.

The space she describes is no longer purely cosmic but also mental and
epistemological---a space for the skin to slightly detach and raciality
\[End Page 134\] to be placed in suspension. [[This is a space for the
flesh to be not the product of dispossession but]{.mark} rather [the
location of]{.mark} pure [sentience]{.mark}, one that the film
translates [through a process of mattering]{.mark}]{.underline}: from
Walker\'s actual flesh, seen from an unnaturally close proximity, as if
the camera aspired to eliminate any distance whatsoever between itself
and its profilmic subject, to \"dark waters,\" and eventually to the
extreme close-up of an older man slowly nodding his head. Here, too,
[black gathering produces weight, density, and mass.]{.underline}

Black matter gathers, Dreams shows, but also remembers. Spillers
narrates the loss of family members: her father and mother, her niece,
her nephew, and her last sibling. The details seem at first very
specific to her contingent experience; yet she claims that in this
process she discovered something she didn\'t know: \"dying is really
real. It is really nonnegotiable.\" The particular universal of her loss
traces the same network #BlackLivesMatter attempts to travel by giving
way to the capaciously collective, and beyond that, to the universal
fact of dying. All lives end. Not just black lives.

It is at this point that, through Moten\'s words, the film poses its
crucial question about loving blackness regardless of its relationship
to the after-life of slavery:

I know [there is such a thing as blackness---not an effect of
horror---it survives horror and terror. It can be loved, and it has to
be loved]{.underline}; it should be defended; it should be nurtured.
\[End Page 135\]

I know those things to be true.

I know those things.

As he explains the source and nature of his knowledge, he also affirms
the constant thinking that is \"irreducible in blackness.\" The image of
the sun mentioned at the beginning then transitions to a slow-motion
close-up of Spillers laughing broadly (fig. 12), as if exhilarated,
perhaps in passage toward a suspended lightness that springs from the
knowledge of black love.

#### If we win that black relationality is possible, it disproves pornotroping. They assume that the relationship between non-Black and Black is SOLELY one of domination. This denies Black agency and the history of resistance

Letter: Theorizing Race and Gender in Pop Cultural 'Media' Through a

However, it is important to note that [while black women and girls are
impacted by superimposed pornotropic ways of being seen, a distinction
is to be drawn between identities as produced by others and identities
as appropriated and performed]{.underline} by black women and girls
themselves. Therefore, [although identities are
superimposed]{.underline} onto black women and girls' bodies, [they are
**always contested** and appropriated]{.underline}. Despite contestation
and appropriation, culturally produced and maintained ideas about
identities are also so hegemonicly determined that they appear normative
and are thus internalized. [[Although the pornotropic gaze may be
internalized, **simultaneously operating** may]{.mark} also [be their
**contestations**]{.mark}, notwithstanding how difficult resistance to
pornotropic gazing may be, particularly as they are intermeshed with
reality and as such, difficult to resist altogether]{.underline}.¶
Exploring the pornotropic gaze and its determinacy within contemporary
black religion 12 and cultural media 13 is the major aim of this
dissertation. Womanist theologians and ethicists created a
cross-pollinated theo-ethical trajectory that demarginalized and
re-presented North American black women as thinking and feeling moral
agents with experiences worthy of academic inquiry. Pivotal to their
discourse is demythologizing black womanhood and its variety of cultural
representations. However, a major proposition circulating throughout
this dissertation is that, while womanist theoethical discourse opens
space for examining North American black women's experiences and
representations, what is needed to move that discourse forward in
African American Religion14 from its dependencies on restricted analyses
of black women's experiences, methodological limitations and normative
conceptual restrictions, is an examination of the manner in which the
force of representational epistemes operate in black religion and
culture to over-determine contemporary black women and girls'
experiences within a pornotropic gaze.¶ This dissertation argues that
religious and cultural media are socially organized technologies of
power that reproduce, maintain, circulate, and exchange historical myths
on black womanhood, which black women and girls both resist and
appropriate. 15 Notwithstanding how they may be resisted or
appropriated, operative historical myths need to be deconstructed and,
in many cases, disoriented. This dissertation achieves this by "changing
the letter." "Changing the letter," which refers to the essay, "Changing
the Letter: The Yokes, the Jokes of Discourse, or, Mrs. Stowe, Mr.
Reed," written by Spillers, frames both my theory and strategy for
reading (deconstruction) and writing (retheorizing). It holds that
[words ("letters") can be manipulated ("changed") in a **variety of
ways** to tell [a story]{.mark} that [may be]{.mark} either
**[liberative]{.mark}** or oppressive ("yoke")]{.underline}. Therefore,
[[meanings are not fixed]{.underline}]{.mark}, 16 [[but]{.mark} are
**[constantly influx]{.mark}**, although sometimes appearing
stabilized]{.underline}.¶ [This]{.underline} dissertation [takes issue
with the latter perception: the ways that cultural meanings are
stabilized over time and presented as "truth."]{.underline} 17
[[Pornotropia]{.underline}]{.mark} 18 [[thrives off]{.mark} of
controlling [ideas]{.mark} that are stabilized and [taken for
granted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The phrase, "taken for granted,"
highlights]{.underline} what Alfred Schutz and Thomas Luckmann refer to
as [un-reflected inclinations toward certain actions developed in the
'natural attitude', [which **presume**]{.mark} inter-subjective
[realities]{.mark} of the life-world [to be]{.mark} similarly
experienced or imagined, for example, the idea that there was a world
[prior to]{.mark} our [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}, made up of
subjects, objects and nature, the former of which (human subjects) are
endowed with consciousnesses that interpret meanings amongst themselves
in horizontal and cognitive ways. [[However, "reality,"]{.mark} the
conditions that we encounter, [is **mediated through
interpretation**]{.mark}, which gives rise to certain kinds of conduct
(over others), given our stock of previous experiences, either our own
or inherited]{.underline}. [Previous experiences frame our "stocks of
knowledge" and motivate our attitudes and actions toward certain ends,
given the anticipation of what is believed to be both conventional and
probable]{.underline}. 19¶ [[The "taken for granted"]{.mark} within the
'natural attitude' [neglects **critical queries** that]{.mark} might
[take up how relationships between the subject and representation might
be situated]{.mark}, or, as interpreters, how we may be positioned
towards either (or both), given attitudes]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
kind of thinking [leads to **reductive practices**]{.mark} such as
[reading]{.mark} one's [identity]{.mark} in light of the appearance of a
(projected) profile such [as the]{.mark} taken for granted
"black-female-aswhore" [stereotype]{.mark}, as [opposed to]{.mark} her
**[complex subjectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The latter
enables]{.mark} a variety of [readings]{.mark}, thus **["lessening"
pornotropia]{.mark}**, which depends on the rigidity of a closed
script]{.underline}.¶ This dissertation highlights [a struggle for
truth]{.underline} that [is inextricably linked to lived
experiences]{.underline}, that is,
**[social-cultural-historical-political conditions]{.underline}**. One
aim of this dissertation is to confuse previous readings of "black
womanhood" by blasting the habits of language, linguistic and
representational, its internal signals, inferred ideologies, encodings,
and operation. These strategies enable the mass-reproduction and
continued circulation and closure of the script of black womanhood.
[Circulating myths of black womanhood need to be taken up]{.underline}.
However, [they also need to be taken up differently]{.underline} than
they have been previously in African American religion, culture, and
womanist theoethical scholarship. This dissertation explores their
deployment in religion and culture and the critiques thereof. Both
deployment and criticisms produce layers of meanings that are reproduced
and circulated. I will examine the strategies by which myths of black
womanhood travel, getting realigned and re-appropriated from generation
to generation.¶ [These moves "loosen the yoke" and decrease the jolts of
"America's Grammar Book" on race and gender]{.underline}. The following
chapters emphasize loosening the yoke, while the overall aim of this
dissertation is significantly inspired by the reality of the jolt. "The
jolt" refers to the ongoing threat of symbolic and material violence
caused by day-to-day representational terror, which is mass-produced in
and transmitted through media that "projects"20 and inform certain
opinions and attitudes regarding 'normativity' and 'difference'.

Naomi **Zack 17**. University of Oregon. 03/07/2017. Review of Stain
Removal: Ethics and Race. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,
https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/stain-removal-ethics-and-race/.

Miller begins by [[claiming]{.mark} that there cannot be]{.underline} an
[ethics of race because]{.underline} an [ethics of
**anything**]{.underline} [presupposes that its **subject**]{.underline}
[can be **perceived**]{.underline} or correctly described [in
some]{.underline} \"factual\" or [value-neutral way]{.underline},
because it is \"outside\" of ethics. [But race is]{.underline}
**[already evaluative]{.underline}** (evaluated) [throughout the modern
period]{.underline}, beginning systematically in philosophy with Kant\'s
ordinal (ranked, with whites first) taxonomy of human races. Miller\'s
insistence that race is already inexorably evaluative is based on his
emphasis of the importance of myths about the transfer of value through
heredity and physical embodiment. Physical embodiment is the object of
perception, so that racial identities are what Bernard Williams has
called \"prejudicial objects.\" Miller claims that [value-laden myths
about race have **criminalized some** human bodies]{.underline} in a
tradition of \"blessing and curses.\" [By contrast, and in
**opposition**, **Enlightenment** ideas about moral responsibility made
it possible for]{.underline} individual **[autonomy]{.underline}** [in
a]{.underline} **[single lifetime]{.underline}** \-- the individual
creates her own fate through choices. [[Ethics]{.mark} is
thereby]{.underline} born, but only [in]{.underline}
**[opposition]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the tradition of
**[hereditary]{.underline}** blessings and [**curses**. And the ethical
tradition of individual responsibility **[requires]{.mark}** the
tradition **against which it reacted**, as well as those who remain
identified with the \"blessing and curses\" tradition, that is,
**[racialized \"others.\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} Miller outlines these
core ideas in his Introduction. In chapter 1, he argues that ethical
emphases on deeds neglect accompanying evaluations of the agent. Chapter
2 considers how subjectivity could be \"reconfigured\" in terms of
affiliative relations that transfer value, when awareness of what is
determined could operate as a \"circuit breaker\" on the forces
determining value (pp. 77-8). Chapters 3 and 4 are an analysis of
ancient Greek and early Christian thought about the origination of value
and ethical knowledge as part of the natural world. Here, Miller shows
how value first emerged after action was deemed criminal, a structure
that is proto-typical for the historical emergence of race. Miller\'s
Conclusion is not a \"happy ending,\" because ethical inheritance still
dominates the subject seeking freedom and nothing, not even a reversal
of existing racial power structures, can undo the past. Miller ends with
a passage by James Baldwin which expresses a tension between acceptance
of cursed/criminalized inheritance in the first paragraph and a thirst
for vengeance in the second: The custodian of an inheritance, which is
what blacks have had to be, in Western culture, must hand the
inheritance down the line. So, you, the custodian, recognize, finally
that your life does not belong to you: nothing belongs to you. This will
not sound like freedom to Western ears, since the Western world pivots
on the infantile, and, in action, criminal delusions of possession, and
of property. . . . But the people of the West will not understand this
until everything which they now think they have has been taken away from
them. In passing, one may observe how remarkable it is that a people so
quick and so proud to boast of what they have taken from others are
unable to imagine that what they have taken from others can also be
taken from them. (p. 171) The controversy I predicted at the start of
this review is unlikely to unite moral philosophers and philosophers of
race, because both traditional moral philosophers and progressive
anti-racist philosophers will recognize a fundamental criticism of their
entire enterprise in this work. Enigmatic questions are raised for both
groups of scholars: [[Is race such a]{.underline} **[fundamental
category]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of human existence [that it
**overrides**]{.mark}]{.underline} basic assumptions about [[how
we]{.underline}]{.mark} can develop our characters and [[regard
others?]{.mark} Can the]{.underline} **[historical
contingency]{.underline}** [of race **override**]{.underline} the
**[more important]{.underline}** concerns and **[projects]{.underline}**
[involving]{.underline} **[character]{.underline}** development and
assessment**[?]{.underline}** [How does the importance of what we now
take to be ethical concerns and projects compare with the power of the
value-imbued]{.underline} **[ontology]{.underline}** [of
race?]{.underline} [[If race is]{.mark} already [embedded in]{.mark}
racial]{.underline} [[**ontology**, why]{.mark} is it [not]{.mark}
possible to]{.underline} [**[resolve that circularity through careful
analysis]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[recognizes]{.underline}**
[this]{.underline}]{.mark} [problem, [without seeking
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[purify racial
ontology]{.underline}**]{.mark} as it is commonly taken to be?
[[Philosophers of race]{.underline}]{.mark} might [already
recognize]{.underline} the [morally bad aspects]{.underline} of race
throughout history [and advocate mourning]{.underline} and memorial, [as
well as resolve to [resist]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[morally bad
aspects of race in their]{.mark} own [discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, most philosophers of race who seek to retain racial categories
proceed exactly in that way. [[Similarly, ethicists could]{.mark} take
special care to [cultivate **awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of how
**their moral prescriptions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and systems
**[[exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}** or already criminalize
**[[nonwhites]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Although]{.underline}, as noted,
[Miller]{.underline} [**[claims]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} **[enterprise of
[ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is **impossible**]{.underline}
[without]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nonwhite]{.underline}** **[[racial
others]{.underline}]{.mark}** who are [[already
considered]{.underline}]{.mark} morally bad or [[not qualified to be
ethical subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} or objects, [[he has given
**little support for this sweeping assertion**. Surely, the
**abolitionist movement**]{.underline}]{.mark} against slavery, [white
[supporters of]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. **[[civil
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** movement, [[and]{.mark} international
[humanitarian discourse **disturb** that
generalization]{.mark}]{.underline}, if only [[as an **empirical
matter**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, although Miller resists
addressing race as racism, [it is difficult to understand how his
analysis of race as a stain that cannot be removed from ethics and his
analysis of ethics as **ineradicably white**]{.underline} (or not
nonwhite) [does]{.underline} **[not amount to deep
analysis]{.underline}** of anti-nonwhite racism. Miller\'s book is a
short, dense, brilliant, and fascinating work that is very important for
its historical and phenomenological depth of analysis. Miller\'s
analysis proceeds by unveiling or positing a horrible but compelling
prophecy that to remove ideas of nonwhite race as curse would also
remove the need for ethics. The question is whether there would be
interest in taking responsibility if some individuals were no longer
burdened by hereditary criminalization. [[The]{.underline}
**[illogic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of this question, [that A is
motivated to be ethical **because B is not ethical**, is **alleviated**
if]{.mark} those [\"others\"]{.mark} so burdened [are **recognized as
projections of the ethical self**]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [that is,
criminalized B is a projection of ethical A. Still, **[removing the need
for ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by removing]{.mark} what it is a
rebellion against, namely the tradition of **determined badness or
[criminalization]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [does]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} necessarily
**[[preclude]{.underline}]{.mark}** [some [people]{.mark} from
**[gratuitously choosing]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be [[**good**. That
already happens when ethics is purely secular and **some are
kind.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

### AT: Nuclear K

#### Nuclear fear is [compatible]{.underline} with avowing the [everyday]{.underline} apocalypse of black people \-- BUT \-- assessing the world [before]{.underline} a nuclear strike as [no different]{.underline} than a world [after]{.underline} one is whitewashing. 

**Thompson '18** \[Nicole; April 4th; Creative Writer; RaceBaitR, "Why I
will not allow the fear of a nuclear attack to be white-washed,"
https://racebaitr.com/2018/04/06/2087/\]

I couldn't spare empathy for a white woman whose biggest fear was
something that hadn't happened yet and might not. Meanwhile,
[[my]{.mark} most **significant [fears]{.mark}**
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} in motion: women and men [[dying in
**cells**]{.mark} after being **wrongly imprisoned**]{.underline},
choked out for peddling cigarettes, [[or **shot to
death**]{.underline}]{.mark} during 'routine' traffic stops. I twitch
when my partner is late, worried that a cantankerous cop has brutalized
or shot him because he wouldn't prostrate himself.

[[As a **woman of color**]{.underline}]{.mark}, I am aware of the
[multiple types of [violence]{.mark} that [threaten me
**currently**]{.mark}---[not **theoretically**. Street
harassment]{.mark}]{.underline}, excessively affecting me as a Black
woman, has blindsided me since I was eleven. A premature body
[[meant]{.underline}]{.mark} being catcalled before I'd discussed the
birds and the bees. It meant being followed, whistled at, or groped. As
an adult, while navigating through neighborhoods with extinguished
street lights, I noticed the correlation between women's safety and
street lighting---as well as the fact that Black and brown neighborhoods
were never as brightly lit as those with a more significant white
population.

I move quickly through those unlit spaces, never comforted by the
inevitable whirl of red and blue sirens. In fact, it's always been the
contrary. Ever so often, cops approach me in their vehicle's encouraging
me to "Hurry along," "Stay on the sidewalk," or "Have a good night." My
spine stiffening, I never believed they endorsed my safety. Instead, I
worried that I'd be accused of an unnamed accusation, corned by a cop
who preys on Black women, or worse. A majority of my 50-minute bus ride
from the southside of Chicago to the north to join these women for the
birthday celebration was spent reading articles about citywide
shootings. I began with a Chicago Tribute piece titled "33 people shot,
seven fatally, in 13 hours," then toppled into a barrage of RIP posts on
Facebook and ended with angry posts about police brutality on Tumblr.
You might guess, by the time I arrived to dinner I wasn't in the mood
for the "I can't believe we're all going to die because Trump is an
idiot" shit.

I shook my head, willing the meal to be over, and was grateful when the
check arrived just as someone was asking me about my hair. My thinking
wasn't all too different from Michael Harriot's 'Why Black America Isn't
Worried About the Upcoming Nuclear Holocaust." While the meal was partly
pleasant, I departed [[thinking, "fear of **nuclear**]{.mark}
**demolitio[n]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} just **some [white
shit]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Sadly, that thought would not last long.

I still vibe with Harriot's statement, "Black people have lived under
the specter of having our existence erased on a white man's whim since
we stepped onto the shore at Jamestown Landing."
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, a friend---a Black friend---ignited my
nuclear paranoia by sharing theories about when it might happen and who
faced the greatest threat. In an attempt to ease my friend's fear, I
leaned in to listen but accidentally toppled down the rabbit hole too. I
forked through curated news feeds. I sifted through "fake news," "actual
news," and foreign news sources. Suddenly, an idea took root: [**nuclear
[strike]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**disproportionately**
impact **Black** ]{.mark}**people**, **[brown]{.mark} people**, [and
**low-income**]{.mark} **individuals**]{.underline}.

North Korea won't target the plain sight racists of Portland, Oregon,
the violently microaggressive liberals of the rural Northwest, or the
white-hooded klansmen of Diamondhead, Mississippi. No, under the
instruction of the supreme leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea will likely
strike densely populated urban areas, such as Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington D.C., and New York City. These locations stand-out as targets
for a nuclear strike because they are densely populated U.S. population
centers. [[Attacking]{.underline}]{.mark} the heart of the nation or
**[populous [cities]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would [translate to]{.mark}
**more [casualties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With that in mind, it's not
lost on me that the most [**populous [cities]{.mark}** [in the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [boast
sizeable]{.mark}]{.underline} diverse populations, or more plainly put:
**[[Black populations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This stresses me out!
There's a creeping chill that follows me, a silent alarm that rings each
time my Google alert chimes letting me know that Donald Trump has yet
again provoked Kim Jong-Un, a man who allegedly killed his very own
uncle. I've grown so pressed by the idea of nuclear holocaust that my
partner and I started gathering non-perishables, candlesticks, a
hand-crank radio, and other must-buy items that can be banked in a
shopping cart. The practice of preparing for a nuclear holocaust strike
sometimes feels comical, particularly when acknowledging that there has
long been a war on Black people in this country.

Blackness is bittersweet in flavor. We are blessed with the melanized
skin, the MacGyver-like inventiveness of our foremothers, and our
blinding brightness---but the anti-blackness that we experience is also
blinding as well as stifling. We are stuck by rigged systems, punished
with the prison industrial complex, housing discrimination, pay
discrimination, and worse. We get side-eyes from strangers when we're
"loitering," and the police will pull us over for driving "too fast" in
a residential neighborhood. We get murdered for holding cell phones
while standing in our grandmother's backyard.

The racism that strung up our ancestors, kept them sequestered to the
back of the bus and kept them in separate and unequal schools still
lives. It lives, and it's more palpable than dormant. To me, this means
one thing: Trump's America isn't an unfortunate circumstance, it's a
homecoming event that's hundreds of years in the making, no matter how
many times my white friends' say, "He's not my president."

In light of this homecoming, [[we]{.mark} **now [flirt]{.mark}** [with
a]{.mark} **new, [larger]{.mark}** fear]{.underline} of a [**Black
[genocide]{.mark}**[. America has]{.mark} **always [worked]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}wards **Black [eradication]{.mark}**
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} a steady stream of [**life-threatening
[inequality]{.mark}**[, but **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline} on
American soil [would be **[swift]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And for this
reason I've grown tired of whiteness being at the center of the nuclear
conversation. The race-neutral approach to the dialogue, and a tendency
to continue to promote the idea that missiles will land in suburban and
rural backyards, instead of inner-city playgrounds, is false.

"The Day After," the iconic, highest-rated television film in history,
aired November 20, 1983. More than 100 million people tuned in to watch
a film postulating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The film, which would go on to affect President Ronald Reagan and
policymakers' nuclear intentions, shows the "true effects of nuclear war
on average American citizens." The Soviet-targeted areas featured in the
film include Higginsville, Kansas City, Sedalia, Missouri, as well as El
Dorado Springs, Missouri. They depict the destruction of the central
United States, and viewers watch as full-scale nuclear war transforms
middle America into a burned wasteland. Yet unsurprisingly, the
[[devastation]{.underline}]{.mark} from the attack [[is]{.mark}
**completely [white-washed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leaving out the more
likely victims which are the more densely populated (Black) areas.

**[[Death]{.mark} tolls]{.underline}** would be high for white
populations, yes, but large-scale losses of Black and brown folks would
outpace that number, due to placement and poverty. That number [[would
be]{.mark} **pushed [higher]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **limited
[access]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} premium **[health
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}**, wealth, and resources. The [[effects
of]{.mark} **radiation [sickness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, burns,
compounded injuries, and malnutrition would throttle Black and brown
communities and [[would **mark us** for
**generations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's for that reason that we have
to do more to foster disaster preparedness among Black people where we
can. [[**Black people** deserve]{.mark} the [space to explore]{.mark}
**nuclear [unease]{.mark}**[, even if we have **competing
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}, anxieties, and worries.

### AT: Cruel Optimism

#### Time is a [glimpse]{.underline} of possibility, futures imagined by [fiat]{.underline} aren't the [cruelly optimistic]{.underline} impasse of the present 

**Wilder 17**---Associate Professor of Anthropology at CUNY Graduate
Center \[Gary, 2017, "Anticipation," Political Concepts: A Critical
Lexicon Issue 3,
<https://www.politicalconcepts.org/anticipation-gary-wilder/>, language
edited change denoted by brackets\] AMarb

[There is no doubt that **[cruel optimism]{.mark}** and benevolent
**pessimism** have]{.underline} produced, and [leveraged the concept of
anticipation]{.underline} in order [to prohibit]{.underline} or require
certain kinds of [citizen action]{.underline}, to legitimize or exempt
certain state interventions, [to [produce **docile**]{.mark} and anxious
[subjects]{.mark} who become trapped in states of what
**Berlant**]{.underline} has nicely [phrased "animated
suspension."]{.underline}15 The constant exhortation to self-manage,
improve, and promote is accompanied by precarity and exhaustion,
uncertainty and anxiety, disorientation and meaninglessness.
[[But]{.mark} does this mean that all future-oriented thinking or action
is intrinsically disabling, normalizing, and depoliticizing? It would be
a mistake to reduce **futurity** as such to a **liberal conception of
progress**, or anticipation to a liberal ideology or affect. Doing so is
precisely what has led some of these scholars to draw dubious political
conclusions]{.underline} from their own important insights. Think here
of Berlant's assertion of the present as an impasse in relation to which
affective beings must focus on survival, maintenance, and adaptation,
"without futurity."16 She dismisses the wish for new images of the good
life as a symptom of the current situation.17 Or, consider David Scott's
melancholic ruminations about our being tragically stranded in a
post-socialist political present. Adams, Murphy, and Clarke ask us to
refuse anticipation as such.18 And [Edelman promotes an anti-political
opposition to "every realization of futurity,"]{.underline} any
aspiration to forge "some more perfect social order," [any action
oriented toward future "good."]{.underline}19 [Instead he
celebrates]{.underline} jouissance as bound up with the death drive and
[an **absolutist negation** of social form.]{.underline}20 [By [treating
the present as]{.mark} one-dimensional and [unsurpassable]{.mark}, such
criticism **[accedes to existing arrangements]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and discounts politics oriented toward a future good life as
intrinsically delusional, self-undermining, or conservative. But to
abandon good-life imaginaries and future-oriented practices is to erase
the crucial space between how things are and how they ought to
be.]{.underline} It is no surprise, therefore, that such thinking often
turns to (post-political understandings of) affect, bodies, objects, or
deep history as the only way to think outside or against existing
conditions and ideologies. How then are we to pursue progressive
politics when relations of domination are mediated by the idea and
reality of progress itself?21 Against the liberal tendency to plan and
predict we must insist on a radically open future, and refuse to define
that which it might hold. But against the liberal tendency to project
present arrangements, forward, we must also fashion images of the good
life. Of course this imperative leads immediately to a further
challenge. How are we to envision alternative social arrangements when
the concepts, frameworks, and forms with which to do so can only really
be furnished by an open future that has not yet arrived? This is the
very dilemma implied by Marx's claim that "the social revolution of the
nineteenth century cannot take its poetry from the past but only from
the future."22 Radical politics is thereby fated to imagine the
unimaginable. And this is the challenge posed by Adorno's call to
contemplate the world from the standpoint of redemption. 3. The Price of
Messianism [Some thinkers have attempted to challenge liberal
progressivism without abandoning futurity by turning to ungrounded
utopianism]{.underline}, blank futurism, or [Messianic apocalypticism.
But such moves also tend to leave present arrangements
undisturbed]{.underline}---whether [by]{.underline} idly fantasizing
about ideal worlds, [refusing to name possible alternatives, or either
fetishizing or waiting for the sudden event that will produce an
absolute rupture]{.underline}. Think here of Bloch's "principle of
hope," Derrida's "waiting without expectation," and Badiou's "fidelity
to the event."23 We might usefully recall Gershom Scholem's remarks on
"the paradoxical nature" of the Messianic idea in Judaism whereby the
wished-for redemption can have no concrete relationship to previous
history. As a "transcendence breaking in upon history . . . from an
outside source," he explains, Jewish redemption rejects the
Enlightenment idea of historical progress. But it also rules out the
possibility of immanent developments or history-making practices.
Scholem thus suggests that the "price demanded by Messianism" has been
"endless powerlessness in Jewish history . . . There is something grand
about living in hope, but at the same time there is something profoundly
unreal about it . . . in Judaism the Messianic idea has compelled a life
lived in deferment."24 Although Benjamin invoked this Messianic
tradition, his reflections "On the Concept of History" do not imply
powerlessness, pessimism, or deferment. Noting the Jewish prohibition on
"inquiring into the future," he endorsed its focus on "remembrance" as a
way to "disenchant the future, which holds sway over those who turn to
soothsayers for Enlightenment."25 But Benjamin was less concerned with
renouncing futurity as such than with challenging the homogeneous empty
clock time and the associated continuum that underlie bourgeois
conceptions of predictable futures, automatic progress, and historicist
history. Benjamin seeks to break the spell of bourgeois progress by
understanding history in terms of "Now-time, which, as a model of
messianic time, comprises the entire history of mankind in a tremendous
abbreviation."26 But this was neither a call to adapt to the present nor
to wait for a divine irruption. It was a reminder that "every second was
the straight gate through which the Messiah might enter."27 But by
Messiah, he means us---contemporary human actors. We can recognize this
as a political, and not a strictly theological, claim when we read it
alongside of Benjamin's second thesis: "there is a secret agreement
between past generations and the present one . . . our coming was
expected on earth . . . like every generation that preceded us, we have
been endowed with a weak messianic power on which the past has a
claim."28 In this formulation, living historical actors are themselves
quasi-Messianic agents who, at any second and in the name of past
generations, might initiate a revolutionary irruption, break the
historical continuum, stop clock-time and redeem the world. Benjamin
invoked revolutionary Messianism to challenge the political passivity of
Social Democrats whose faith in automatic human progress, he argued, had
opened the door to fascism and diverted the working classes from making
their own history here and now. By exploding the continuum of history
and transcending clock time, he believed, they would liberate humanity
from the "progressive" processes that had enslaved them and their
ancestors. In this way modern society would be emancipated from an
infernal history of ongoing catastrophe whereby human actions fueled the
quasi-autonomous force that was propelling them blindly into a future
over which they had no control.29 At the very least, Benjamin suggested
that this revolutionary interruption would end the "storm" of progress,
free humans from their "servile integration in an uncontrollable
apparatus," and, maybe even allow actors "to stay, awaken the dead, and
make whole what has been smashed" (as the Angel of History wished to,
but could not, do).30 But despite the Jewish injunction not to inquire
into the future, Benjamin is not only offering a formal definition of
revolution as redemptive rupture. We often forget that he also
elaborates substantive ideas about what a redeemed, or
post-revolutionary, society would entail. He relays that it would mark
the end of a "positivist" and "corrupted conception of labor" based in
"the Protestant work ethic" which collapses human progress with
"technological development" and is "tantamount to the exploitation of
nature."31 In contrast, Benjamin envisions a new form of "cooperative
labor" that would "increase efficiency to such an extent that . . . far
from exploiting nature, would help her give birth to the creations that
now lie dormant in her womb."32 Emancipated from alienated labor,
historical "progress," and the meaningless tyranny of clock time, human
actors (honoring their responsibility to enslaved ancestors) would make
their own worlds within a qualitative now-time. Benjamin thus offers us
an orientation to futurity that breaks with the logic of deferment
contained in both liberal progressivism and blank Messianism. With the
idea of a revolutionary rupture that can be initiated in any given
second, his insights point to an understanding of anticipation as a kind
of political disposition whereby radical actors cultivate a state of
readiness for any possibility at every possible moment. But by also
offering a positive vision of what a better society might look like, his
call to act in the name of oppressed ancestors, provide concrete content
to such anticipatory action. Yet, Benjamin does not try to account for
how these actors might move from this now to a next-now. Beyond routing
future possibilities through past eras, he does not indicate how
subjects might orient their action, recognize what might actually be
possible or even desirable, or what conditions might facilitate this or
that leap. He beautifully triangulates revolutionary classes, past
generations, and historical materialists, but does not work out the
mediations between radical thinking and revolutionary praxis. He directs
our attention to "now time" as cause and consequence of a revolutionary
interruption, but does not address the dialectical movement between
acting and imagining, naming and discovering, making and seizing. 4.
Practicing Anticipation Adorno too sought to overturn the bourgeois
conception of progress without paying the price of Messianism. In his
1962 essay, he argues argues that if we are to reclaim a real concept of
progress we need to avoid both "atemporal theology" (which expects
redemption from a "transcendental intervention") and "the idolization of
history" (as if progress were automatic or human actions necessarily led
toward a more perfect world).33 Adorno explains that the term progress
promises "an answer to the doubt and the hope that things will finally
get better, that people will at last be able to breathe a sigh of
relief."34 Like Benjamin, he insists that "Wherever bourgeois society
satisfies the concept it cherishes as its own, it knows no progress;
wherever it knows progress, it violates its own law."35 But rather than
simply reject the concept of progress, he seeks to sublate its bourgeois
form. He writes, "The nexus of deception surrounding progress reaches
beyond itself . . . the devastation wrought by progress can be made good
again, if at all, only by its own forces, never by the restoration of
the preceding conditions that were its victims.36 He does this by
seeking real progress precisely in those places where bourgeois
"progress" is interrupted and the bourgeois concept is called into
question. He writes, "Progress means: to step out of the magic spell,
even out of the spell of progress . . . in that . . . humanity . . .
brings to a halt the domination it exacts upon nature . . . In this way
it could be said that progress occurs where it ends."37 One thereby
pursues that which progress promises precisely by interrupting or
undoing that which purports to be progress (as well as the conceptual
framework that reduces progress to domination and misrecognizes
domination as progress). Despite Adorno's reputation for political
pessimism and philosophical abstraction (and vice versa), he does not
only insist on the possibility of real human progress, but suggests that
it must be pursued concretely. He writes, Too little of what is good has
power in the world for progress to be expressed in a predictive judgment
about the world, but there can be no good, not a trace of it without
progress . . . Every individual trait in the nexus of deception is
nonetheless relevant to \[progress's\] possible end. Good is what
wrenches itself free, finds a language, opens its eyes. In its
conditions of wresting free, it is interwoven in history that, without
being organized unequivocally toward reconciliation, in the course of
its movement allows the possibility of redemption to flash up.38
[Adorno]{.underline} thus [offers an orientation to [futurity]{.mark},
at once political and dialectical, that is [organized around]{.mark}
human [**action**]{.mark} in the present. **[Beyond]{.mark} the
[opposition]{.mark} [between]{.mark} gradual [reform]{.mark}ism [and
revolution]{.mark}ary rupture**, [through]{.mark} the [**everyday** work
of]{.mark} finding and [wrenching]{.mark} free [bits of good]{.mark}
which can be associated [with **new languages**]{.mark} and rewoven into
history]{.underline}, the possibility of reconciliation is opened and
glimpses of redemption are possible. [Adorno thus suggests that these
glimpses [of]{.mark} future [**possibility** must be pursued
**concretely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But he also reminds us that these
[[**glimpses** are no less important than the pursuit]{.mark}. He
explicitly links prospect [for transformation]{.mark} to acts [of
**political imagination**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As with "progress,"
Adorno tries to think utopia against "utopia." In his 1964 exchange with
Ernst Bloch, he criticizes ideological forms of "cheap" and "false"
utopias which present the given world as already reconciled and
realized.39 And he recognizes the value of the (Jewish) prohibition
against picturing the future concretely "insofar as we do not know what
the correct thing would be."40 At the same time, he insists that
"something terrible happens due to the fact that we are forbidden to
cast a picture . . . the commandment against a concrete expression of
utopia tends to defame the utopian consciousness and to engulf it."41 In
the West, he explains "[people have lost . . . the capability to imagine
the totality as something that could be completely different . . .
people are sworn to this world as it is and have this blocked
consciousness vis-à-vis possibility]{.underline}."42 Such concessions to
the given, he suggests, can only be overcome through some kind of
utopian orientation that insists, for example on "the evident
possibility of fulfillment" in modern society or that "a life in freedom
and happiness would be possible today."43 But he is equally concerned by
the fact that "the idea of utopia has actually disappeared completely
from the conception of socialism," explaining, "the apparatus, the how,
the means of a socialist society have taken precedence over any possible
content, for one is not allowed to say anything about the possible
content. Thereby the theory of socialism that is decidedly hostile
toward utopia now tends really to become a new ideology concerned with
the domination of humankind."44 Adorno warns that any claim to know the
future should be avoided. Yet he also insists that unless some kind of
"picture" of what might be possible can "appear within one's grasp, then
one basically does not know at all what the actual reason for the
totality is, why the entire apparatus has been set in motion."45 He
concludes by agreeing with Bloch that there can be no transformation, no
socialism, no fulfillment without the utopian-transcendent belief that
"something's missing."46 In short, Adorno invites critics to undertake a
tricky, if not paradoxical, practice of envisioning without defining.
[This [balancing]{.mark} act [between]{.mark} identifying
[concrete]{.mark} possibilities through [utopian imagination]{.mark}
[while not foreclosing outcomes]{.mark} through predictive naming is a
crucial dimension of what I am calling anticipation. This orientation to
the future [breaks with]{.mark} the [**liberal** faith that
things]{.mark} will automatically and [**progressively** work]{.mark}
themselves [out]{.mark}. But does so in ways that differ fundamentally
from either "waiting without expectation" or nihilistic calls to accept
the impasse of the present, abjure transformative projects, or renounce
propositions about a future good life]{.underline}. The concrete utopian
orientation to futurity suggested by Adorno resonates with a similar
position formulated by Henri Lefebvre, another heterodox Marxist who
sought to make sense of late capitalist alienation in the postwar
period. In the first volume of his Critique of Everyday Life (1947),
Lefebvre argued that material progress had created unprecedented
possibilities for the good life, but its benefits were only enjoyed by
the few; real power was stolen from community and placed in the hands of
an elite, and the domination of things was transformed into domination
of humans by other humans.47 He thus describes the colonization of
everyday life by capital. But because capitalism develops unevenly, he
believed, "traces of 'another life,' a community life" organized around
different social logics and values, persisted within a heterogeneous
modernity.48 At the same time, Lefebvre contended, a paradoxical
situation of "backwardsness" emerged in which "life is lagging behind
what is possible" --- behind the very different set of arrangements that
capitalist modernization had actually made possible.49 It is precisely
this proximity between, on the one hand, an alienated existence and, on
the other, that which is no longer possible and that which is newly
possible which, according to Lefebvre, creates opportunities, through
everyday practices, for different ways of being to emerge.50 In cities
especially, he suggests, alternative modes of living and new forms of
solidarity appear in the theater of everyday life.51 In response to
optimistic "partisans of Progress," Lefebvre points out "the decline of
everyday life since . . . Antiquity." But it also differs from
nihilistic calls for adapting to the impasse of the present, abjuring
transformative projects, or renouncing propositions about a future good
life. Conversely, in response to the pessimistic philosophers of
decadence, he insists on "the breadth and magnificence of the
possibilities which are opening out for man, and which are so really
possible . . . (once the political obstacles are shattered)."52 Such
anarchist pessimists, he argues, mistakenly accept "this life as the
only one possible" and are unable to recognize the potential "greatness"
that may shine through alienated forms.53 Rather than focus on the false
opposition between progress and decline, Lefebvre directs our attention
to the difference between quantitative and qualitative forms of
progress. He dismisses as a "childish error" the tendency to base our
image of "the \[hu\]man of the future on what we are now" and "simply
granting him a greater quantity of mechanical means and appliances."54
Rather, he insists, ["we should acquire a sense of qualitative changes,
of modifications in the quality of life]{.underline} -- and above all of
another attitude of the human being toward himself."55 He thus calls on
us to envision a future organized around "total life" and a "living
totality" in which a "truly human" and "total man" may be realized.56
For Lefebvre, [the task of recognizing the possible in the actual
requires creative acts of political imagination]{.underline}. But he
also criticizes idle speculation about fantastic futures, insisting that
understandings of alternatives must emerge [through experimental
practices]{.underline}. He asserts that "man as a total problem" -- "the
possibility of the total" and "truly human man" -- can only be "posed
and resolved on the level of everyday life."57 Challenging the kind of
critique or revolt promoted by "mystics and metaphysicians," he proposed
a dialectical approach that would overcome false oppositions between
"everyday life and festival -- mass moments and exceptional moments . .
. seriousness and play -- reality and dreams."58 According to Lefebvre,
everyday life, especially in cities, becomes the scene of a certain
utopianism which combines imaginative vision with experimental practices
in order to identify and pursue what he called the
"possible-impossible."59 At once future-oriented and now-centered,
aesthetic and political, a serious strategy and an end in itself, such
everyday practices contribute to what a more human "art of living."60 We
might also call this an art of [[anticipation in which
**visionary**]{.mark} thinking [and **experimental** acts come together
in]{.mark} a type of "**[play acting]{.mark}**" that "[explores **what
is possible**]{.mark}."]{.underline}61 In the late 1950s, Lefebvre
further developed this thinking about lived utopianism. Under modern
capitalist conditions, he explains, previous modes of envisioning a
truly human form of life (whether based on fantasies of natural living
or classical antiquity) had either been lost or discredited as fictive
or mythical, but new ones had not taken their place. Far from
celebrating this development, he regarded it as tragic that the postwar
Left had no myth of "the new life" and spoke only in the language of
industrial rationalism, technocratic planning, and productivist
acceleration.62 But Lefebvre also argued that in the new era of postwar
planning there was a resurgence of utopian thinking because "the
advanced countries are lagging behind their own possibilities" and are
"less able to satisfy those who ought to be happy with it."63 He writes,
"Utopianism lives again . . . It is exploring the possibilities of
praxis . . . Imagination is adopting or rediscovering a creative power.
It is pooling forces with an obscurely rediscovered spontaneity."64 And,
"If we are to build a revitalized life . . . [we must use utopian method
experimentally, looking ahead to what is possible and what is impossible
and [transforming this **hypothetical**]{.mark} exploration
[into]{.mark} applicable programs and **[practical
plans]{.mark}**]{.underline}."65 Lefebvre called this orientation a
"philosophy of the possible" which attends to "relations with the real
and the here-and-now" in order to discover "the opening, by which \[we\]
may enter in a practical way into the 'possible-impossible'
dialectic."66 Lefebvre's call in the late 1950s for a new "revolutionary
romanticism" seemed to receive an uncanny answer in what he regarded as
"the irruption" of May '68. For him this unforeseen event "broke into"
everyday life even as everyday practices constituted that which was
revolutionary about the event.67 For Lefebvre, May '68 was neither an
unmediated presentist eruption nor the working out of a blueprint for
the future. He writes, "A theory of the movement has to emerge from the
movement itself, for it is the movement that has revealed, unleashed,
and liberated theoretical capacities."68 His analysis of '68 emphasizes
spontaneous popular contestation and mass participation, the commitment
to transform society as a whole and create new forms of life, and above
all the emergence of experiments in self-management which were at once
concrete and utopian, practical and performative, actual and
prefigurative, political and cultural. For Lefebvre, this "irruption"
demonstrated that "everyday existence" cannot be "transcended in one
leap" but only through "the process of self-management."69 He
characterized it as an "unthinkable movement" that nevertheless
"actually existed" and therefore allowed and compelled people to "think
the unthinkable."70 Not surprisingly, he called May '68 a "concrete
utopia."71 The dialectic movement between utopian imagination and
experimental practice allowed May '68 to make real a supposedly
impossible form of life in the "anticipated urban society."72 He writes,
"The specifically utopian function of cultural contestation will thus
supersede itself by fulfilling itself in practice."73 This kind of
collective anticipation through concrete utopian experiments in
self-management comes through clearly in Kristin Ross's insightful
analysis of the Paris Commune. Ross writes: More important than any laws
the Communards were able to enact was simply the way in which their
daily workings inverted entrenched hierarchies and divisions . . . The
world is divided between those who can and those who cannot afford the
luxury of playing with words or images. When that division is overcome,
as it was under the Commune . . . what matters more than any images
conveyed, laws passed, or institutions founded are the capacities set in
motion.74 If social relations are to be radically transformed, Ross
suggests, it will not be by teaching people how to be citizens of a
future society, but by mobilizing such capacities, which are at once
practical and theoretical, political and aesthetic, actual and
potential.75 In a similar spirit Massimiliano Tomba examines the
"insurgent universality" that was practiced and performed by the more
radical and subaltern forces within the French Revolution. He writes,
this insurgency not only interrupted the continuum of a specific
historical configuration of power, but . . . disclosed and anticipated
new political pathways, which indicated alternative trajectories beyond
political modernity. These pathways were molten in the red-hot magma of
many experiments, abandoned or repressed. The experiment was the
virtuous "skidding off course (dérapage)" of the Revolution during which
slaves, women and the poor gained voice and acted as if they were
citizens.76 More recently, we might consider the category confounding
character of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the everyday practices of
"horizontalism" following the 2001 financial crisis in Argentina, in
recent Occupy struggles, and autonomous popular movements worldwide.
Concrete utopian anticipation has assumed more robust forms in the
Zapatista experiment in Chiapas, Mexico and the ongoing Kurdish
experiment in Rojava, Syria. 5. Reconstruction, Transfiguration,
Improvisation These brief examples should make clear that the politics
of [[anticipation]{.underline}]{.mark} are not only symbolic and
performative. An anticipatory dialectic of prefiguration and
transfiguration -- or the circular relation among envisioning, enacting,
and realizing -- [[has been]{.underline}]{.mark} especially well
[[developed with]{.mark}in [the black radical
tradition]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Consider]{.underline}, for example,
[W.E.B. Du Bois's plan]{.underline} during the early 1930s [to organize
African Americans into self-managing consumer cooperatives]{.underline}.
He took as his staring points the refractory character of the color line
(which proved to be invulnerable to rational refutation or legal
challenges), the mutually reinforcing relation between racism and
poverty, the white supremacy of the American labor movement, and the
devastating effect of the Great Depression on the black community. Given
this historical condition, Du Bois sought to identify immanent
possibilities within alienated forms by turning the fact of segregation
into a source of social strength and political education. [He argued
that if planned and organized, existing networks of black sociality and
exchange could ground a new form of solidarity]{.underline} and autonomy
through which [to confront capitalism and racism]{.underline}. He
believed that self-managing cooperatives organized around mutualist
lines could create opportunities for work without exploitation,
production without profit, exchange without stratification, knowledge
production without exclusion -- in ways that would reinforce bonds
across different social sectors of the black community.77 On one level,
Du Bois's multi-faceted program was a pragmatic response to an immediate
predicament. These consumer cooperatives would create a basis for
economic survival under conditions of Jim Crow segregation during the
Depression. By doing so without depending on either state aid (that
might not come) or legal reform (that might not matter), it was also
meant to transform formal liberty into substantive freedom. Du Bois
emphasized that these economic efforts were meant to complement, and
help to realize, rather than replace the existing civil rights struggle.
He offered a strategy for achieving full citizenship from a position of
economic security, strength, and leverage. But Du Bois's call for
economic self-management was also [[a concrete utopian
project]{.underline}]{.mark} to radically reconstruct American democracy
by abolishing the color line and overcoming capitalist social relations.
In his view, these self-managing cooperatives would [[allow **black**
actors to develop]{.underline}]{.mark} alternative forms of labor,
exchange, and sociality -- the [[new]{.mark} subjectivities, everyday
practices, ethical [relations]{.mark}, and spiritual/cultural
orientations [that would]{.mark}: 1. [prepare]{.mark} themselves for
[the future]{.mark} order [they desired]{.mark}, 2. [model]{.mark} (to
themselves and others) [what was possible]{.mark} and what that future
might entail (through experimental practices), 3. help to [hasten that
future]{.mark} by enacting it here and now ([to materialize it by
envisioning it]{.mark}, and to come to see it through material
practices). With this plan for strategic self-segregation, **[Du Bois
was not calling]{.mark} for blacks [to withdraw from American
society]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} He was recognizing that their
[**involuntary** status]{.mark} as a nation-within-a-nation
[offered]{.mark} them [an opportunity]{.mark} (and perspective) [to lead
the nation]{.mark} as a whole (beginning with the white working class)
[on a]{.mark} different [path **beyond** the color
line]{.mark}]{.underline} and towards socialist democracy. His program
was based on the conviction that racial domination could never be
overcome under capitalist conditions and that socialism could never be
realized until the color line was abolished.78 It envisioned
self-managing black communities playing a vanguard role in a process
whereby a whole range of cooperative movements among different
communities would form, federate, and help to create a new "cooperative
commonwealth" in and beyond America. It thereby anticipated both a
multi-racial socialist democracy within America and a new order of
international solidarity among self-managing peoples of color against
global imperialism. In this way, Du Bois believed that the black freedom
struggle could realize American democracy, empower and unite colonized
peoples, redeem the West, and emancipate humanity -- through concrete
everyday practices that anticipated, in all of these ways, a seemingly
impossible future already made plausible by present conditions and
glimpsed through the subaltern's privileged critical insight. On the one
hand, [his plan was a revolutionary rejection of liberal progress. It
insisted that no change would come automatically]{.underline} and that
real emancipation would not be possible by merely adjusting the existing
framework. [On the other hand, this was a program for radical
transformation that refused the fantasy of sudden revolutionary
rupture.]{.underline} Du Bois was mindful of the long black Atlantic
history during which each emancipatory break enabled a new forms of
domination. He suggested that the process of subjective and objective
transformation that he was proposing might take decades, or even
generations. It was this long view that helps explain why Du Bois
developed this plan during the period when he was writing Black
Reconstruction in America, and vice versa. In his 1935 masterwork, Du
Bois demonstrates how black slaves interrupted the historical continuum
through a "general strike" whereby they fled plantations and withdrew
their labor power from the Confederate war effort. He famously recounts
how freed slaves experienced emancipation as an apocalyptic rupture.
But, as importantly, he demonstrates how an alliance of freed blacks,
Southern white workers, and Northern abolition democrats (black and
white) was briefly able to leverage the Freedman's Bureau to open the
possibility for an experiment in non-racial socialist democracy that, in
challenging the very basis of capitalist private property and American
social divisions, far exceeded the intentions of the U.S. government and
Northern interests who had supported its creation. Much of his study is
devoted to describing the revolutionary attempt to reconstruct the very
bases of American democracy through experimental practices made possible
by a contingent set of conditions that created a unique historical
situation which was seized by an alliance of actors who anticipated --
envisioned, performed, pursued -- an alternative future in their
everyday acts. This nexus of vision, conjuncture, and practices, he
suggests, positioned freed blacks to be the vanguard of a socialist
revolution and truly democratic society that might have been. But Du
Bois explains how this revolutionary "Southern Experiment" was
ultimately foreclosed by white working class racism. When white workers
allied with the planter class against freed blacks, Northern capital was
allowed to destroy the prospect of real democracy (and racial equality)
in America and across the imperialist world. Du Bois demonstrates how
this process allowed slave emancipation to evolve into a regime of legal
segregation and social stigmatization -- the very regime into which Du
Bois was born and against which he spent his life in militant struggle.
Du Bois's interwar plan for self-managing black cooperatives can thus be
read as an untimely attempt to pursue the unrealized promise of the
post-Civil War Southern Experiment. In the 1930s Du Bois sought to
revitalize the unrealized 1870s project to reconstruct American
democracy on multi-racial and socialist lines.79 The anticipatory
character of Du Bois's account of Reconstruction and his program for
cooperative self-management may be situated in a long history of black
Atlantic concrete utopianism which combined visionary projects with
experimental practices. Here we might think of maroon communities
throughout the New World slave system, Toussaint Louverture's 1801 black
republic, and the emergence of what Laurent Dubois, following Jean
Casimir, called the "counter-plantation" system in post-revolutionary
Haiti. Thomas Holt describes how a similar movement for peasant
self-sufficiency immediately followed the emancipation of slaves in 19th
century Jamaica. As I have argued elsewhere, Aimé Césaire's and Léopold
Senghor's constitutional struggle to transform imperial France into a
postnational democratic federation may be located in this tradition of
anticipatory politics. But so too can Frantz Fanon's account of the new
forms of life that emerged through the lived experience of revolutionary
struggle for Algerian independence and Patrice Lumumba's untimely
experiment in popular democracy in the Congo. In each of these
anticipatory initiatives, we can recognize what Paul Gilroy has called
the dialectic of fulfillment and transfiguration. In The Black Atlantic,
Gilroy describes a pragmatic "politics of fulfillment" whose "normative
content focuses attention on . . . the notion that a future society will
be able to realize the social and political promise that present society
has left unaccomplished."80 Gilroy distinguishes this orientation from a
utopian "politics of transfiguration" that strives "continually to move
beyond the grasp of the merely linguistic, textual, and discursive. . .
This politics exists on a lower frequency, where it is played, danced,
and acted, as well as sung and sung about, because words . . . will
never be enough to communicate its unsayable claims to truth."81 Gilroy
treats black musical expression as an especially rich locus and medium
for such utopian acts. Gilroy argues that this "tradition of expression"
"refuses to accept that the political is a readily separable domain.
[Its basic desire is to conjure up and enact the new modes of
friendship, happiness, and solidarity that are consequent on the
overcoming of the racial oppression."82 He suggests that [these]{.mark}
two modes of politics [are not **mutually exclusive**]{.mark}; within
the black Atlantic tradition they have long co-existed and complemented
each other]{.underline}. But if the politics of fulfillment has
generated a black "counter-discourse" through which to make political
claims, Gilroy argues, the politics of transfiguration constitutes a
"counterculture of modernity" that seeks to expand the very domain and
meaning of politics itself -- partly by linking it to ethics and
aesthetics, imaginative practice and cultural performance, embodied
practices and lived memories.83 I would like to underscore the
anticipatory dimensions this politics of trasnsfiguration, which
conjures and enacts new ways of being and relating. According to Gilroy,
it emphasizes the emergence of qualitatively new desires, social
relations, and modes of association within the racial community of
interpretation and resistance and between that group and its erstwhile
oppressors. It points specifically to the formation of a community of
needs and solidarity which is magically made audible in the music itself
and palpable in the social relations of its cultural utility and
reproduction.84 These transfigurative practices create new continuities
among politics, ethics, and aesthetics; Gilroy speaks of "grounded
ethics" and "grounded esthetics.85 Gilroy thus describes a set of
concrete utopian practices that anticipate (by enacting in both form and
content) an alternative good life. He writes, progress from the status
of slaves to the status of citizens led \[western blacks\] to enquire
into what the best possible forms of social and political existence
might be. The memory of slavery, actively preserved as a living
intellectual resource in their expressive political culture, helped them
to generate a new set of answers to this enquiry. They had to fight --
often through their spirituality -- to hold on to the unity of ethics
and politics sundered from each other by modernity's insistence that the
true, the good, and the beautiful had distinct origins and belong to
different domains of knowledge.86 This path from broken present to
utopian future, by way of living memory and embodied performance,
resonates with the ways that Benjamin conjugated remembrance and
rupture. It is indeed likely that Gilroy had both Benjamin and Adorno in
mind when he writes, The history and utility of black music. . . enable
us to trace something of the means through which the unity of ethics and
politics has been reproduced as a form of folk knowledge. This
subculture often appears to be the intuitive expression of some racial
essence but is in fact an elementary historical acquisition produced
from the viscera of an alternative body of cultural and political
expression that considers the world critically from the point of view of
its emancipatory transformation. In the future, it will become a place
which is capable of satisfying the (redefined) needs of human beings
that will emerge once the violence -- epistemic and concrete -- of
racial typology is at an end. Reason is thus reunited with the happiness
and freedom of individuals and the reign of justice within the
collectivity.87 Gilroy affirms that this political orientation converges
with Marxism, even if the convergence is also undercut by the simple
fact that in the critical thought of blacks in the West, social
self-creation through labour is not the centre-piece of emancipatory
hopes. For the descendants of slaves, work signifies only servitude,
misery, and subordination. Artistic expression, expanded beyond
recognition from the grudging gifts offered by the masters as a token
substitute for freedom from bondage, therefore becomes the means towards
both individual self-fashioning and communal liberation. Poiesis and
politics begin to coexist in novel forms \[-- autobiographical writing,
special and uniquely creative ways of manipulating spoken language, and,
above all, the music.\]88 The important point here is not the extent of
Gilroy's Marxism or the accuracy of his interpretation of Western
Marxist desires regarding labor, but that he is describing a tradition
of concrete utopianism through which a future good life is anticipated
(envisioned, enacted, conjured ) through experimental practices that are
at once political, ethical, and aesthetic.89 Gilroy writes eloquently
about an "ethics of antiphony" and "the tactics of sound developed as a
form of black metacommunication."90 His attention to music and
performance as black radicalism's privileged media, and to utopian
enactment or untimely anticipation as central features of black
aesthetics, has been extensively elaborated by Fred Moten. Referring to
blackness as "the extended movement of a specific upheaval, an ongoing
irruption that annaranges every line," Moten links this upheaval and
irruption to (an ethics, politics, and aesthetics) of "the cut" and "the
break."91 Moten uses this multivalent term to index variously the gap
between (as well as the elevated conjunction of): sound and words, music
and text, poetry and philosophy, phenomenology and semiotics, experience
and expression, scream and message, being and knowing, description and
explanation, performance and analysis, showing and naming,
deconstruction and reconstruction, objectivity and subjectivity, body
and spirit, substance and sign, violence and joy, absence and abundance,
visibility and invisibility, tragedy and elegy, singularity and
totality, emotion and structure, spontaneity and preparedness,
individuality and collectivity, event and process, situatedness and
ongoinginess, return and birth, origin and repetition, past and future.
It is through this cut, by lingering in this break -- at once
existential, epistemological, and temporal -- that the (radical) work
and play of "improvisation," in and through and for what he calls
"ensemble," unfolds. This is a dazzling intervention on blackness and/as
improvisation in the break where form mirrors content, or each reworks
the other, in every instant. Among the many ramifying images that Moten
offers is that of improvisation as the performance of an "old new
language -- tragic, hopeful, fallen" that registers "the fantasy of what
hadn't happened yet" and works "to activate the foresight that is not
prophecy but description . . . embodied and silently sounded in the
music's knowing echo of shriek and prayer."92 Descriptive foresight (in
an old-new language) of what has not yet happened wonderfully expresses
the peculiar political logic of anticipation that I have been trying to
outline. Moten explains how this improvisational practice links vision,
performance, and action. He relates blackness (and critique) to the
practice of "lingering" in the "shattering tremble of the improvising
ensemble's music . . . Not in the interest of an understanding or
adequate representation of the action whose performance would occur in
this lingering, but in the interest of an enactive invocation, a
material prayer, the dissemination of the conditions of possibility of .
. . action."93 In short, Moten conjures a space and practice of
imaginative performance and embodied desire that is at once aesthetic,
ethical, and political. It recognizes aesthetic performances as
political acts and political performances as aesthetic acts within a
relational, which is to say ethical, ensemble. For Moten, the practice
of improvisation also confounds reified past-present-future
distinctions. His discussion does not only imply that such
aesthetic-ethical-political practices may anticipate, by enacting, what
hasn't yet happened. It also suggests that they anticipate that which is
not yet known, a wish that can only emerge through present practice and
performance. He thus links improvisation to the "unsayable claims of
black utopian political desire, an unrequited love imaged after the
fact."94 Raising the question of "improvisation's time and the time of
ensemble's organization" Moten writes of the "attempt . . . to sustain
the desire that you anticipate, that you'll have felt even now, to stop
to look up, to sing the inscription."95 This will and capacity to see
and sing the inscription in order to sustain the desire that you
anticipate is one way to understand prophecy. In a recent interview
Moten remarks, "The prophet is the one who tells the brutal truth, who
has the capacity to see the absolute brutality of the already-existing
and to point it out and to tell that truth, but also to see the other
way, to see what it could be. That double-sense, that double-capacity:
to see what's right in front of you and to see through it to what's
ahead of you."96 Moten thereby voices an insight that has long been
recognized by Jewish Marxist and black radical thinkers -- namely that
anticipation is less a matter of predicting the future than of
"foreseeing the present."97 In 1940 Walter Benjamin described the
paradoxical character of the "prophetic relation to the future" by
noting that "the seer's gaze is kindled by the rapidly receding past . .
. the prophet has turned away from the future: he perceives the contours
of the future in the fading light of the past as it sinks before him
into the night of times."98 A few years later, during the war that would
take Benjamin's life, Aimé Césaire identified "the ground of poetic
knowledge" as "an astonishing mobilization of all human and cosmic
forces" in which "all lived experience. All the possibility . . . all
the pasts, all the futures . . . Everything is summoned. Everything
awaits."99 And the "visionary" speaker in his 1946 poem declares, "my
ear to the ground, I heard Tomorrow pass."100 Decades later, but in a
similar spirit, Edouard Glissant writes about the existence within
Caribbean thought and consciousness of "a prophetic vision of the past"
based on "the identification of a painful notion of time and its full
projection forward into the future."101 Perhaps people compelled by
history to inhabit a painful sense of time are gifted with a prophetic
sense of the past and a capacity (and necessity) to foresee the present.
Running through these otherwise distinct reflections is the insight that
[[anticipation]{.mark} entails sudden or stolen glimpses across epochal
divides. It names the proleptic power of acting "as if" impossible
futures were already at hand. 6. Dialectics of Anticipation What
[links]{.mark} these various concrete utopian experiments, thinkers, and
traditions is not only a commitment [to]{.mark} radical politics, direct
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, or autonomous socialism. [They also
share a distinctive orientation to futurity.]{.underline} [Their
reflections and actions point [beyond]{.mark} both the fiction of
[liberal progress and]{.mark} the fantasy of [apocalyptic
rupture.]{.mark} They reject the given order, envision a better world,
and act as if the impossible were possible -- even while mindful that
new forms cannot be planned and implemented but can only emerge
practically, experimentally.]{.underline} We can thus think of
anticipation as a kind of political disposition whereby radical actors
cultivate a state of readiness for any possible possibility and a will
to overcome existing arrangements by acting from the standpoint of a
not-yet redeemed world. We can think of anticipation as an untimely
desire to recognize and pursue alternative possibilities that are
enabled by and condensed within present arrangements. From this
perspective, anticipation prefigures by enacting the supposedly
impossible. [It indexes a politico-temporal orientation, rather than an
affective state]{.underline} or an ideological discourse. As a critical
political concept, anticipation is neither about planning nor waiting.
It rejects nihilistic presentism but also avoids the false opposition
between liberal progress and apocalyptic rupture. (Or we can say that it
rejects liberal progress while avoiding the false opposition between
nihilistic presentism and apocalyptic rupture.) Through an immanent
critique of actual relations that allows actors to recognize supposedly
impossible possibilities, by tacking dialectically between creative
imagination and experimental practices, anticipation seeks to balance
the dual imperative to insist on an open future and to envision
envisioning a good life. We might therefore refer to a dialectics of
anticipation marked by the dual imperatives to be open to the impossible
and to imagine the possible, to envision and enact, to seize the sudden
illumination as it appears and seek to produce it through everyday life.
A dialectical concept of anticipation is a calling for that is also a
calling forth, an enacted idea that may bring into being what it desires
through the performance itself (even as that very image of future
possibilities only arises through such performative acts). Anticipatory
politics are therefore also aesthetic operations (and vice versa).
[[Neither]{.mark} about **[optimism nor pessimism]{.mark}**, these
concrete utopian practices cut across reified distinctions]{.underline}
between immanence and transcendence, present and future, actual and
possible, instrumental and utopian, imagination and action, strategy and
spontaneity, politics and performance. [[Anticipation signals]{.mark} a
[readiness to **interrupt** the continuum]{.mark} and a commitment to
live otherwise]{.underline}. They are not only "practices" in the sense
of doing, they are forms of practice in the sense of learning, of
getting better at -- in this case, getting better at being the kind of
person, living the kind life, entering into the types of social
relations that will only be really possible, or possibly realized, in a
future order.

#### Solar-cycle 25 is [imminent]{.underline}\-\--scientists are [predicting]{.underline} a peak [in 2025]{.underline}.

https://www.space.com/sun-activity-peak-prediction-2022-update //EM

[It\'s **[no coincidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that the
[headlines]{.mark}]{.underline} [have been **[full of]{.mark} solar
[flares]{.mark}** and storms]{.underline}: [Solar [cycle
25]{.mark},]{.underline} as astronomers call it, [is **now [well
underway]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Solar **activity**]{.underline}, which space weather experts measure by
the number of visible sunspots, [[**rises and falls** on a
cycle]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [lasts]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[roughly [11 years]{.mark}]{.underline}** from minimum to minimum,
although one cycle can be as short as nine years or as long as 13. [The
**[sun\'s new cycle]{.mark}**]{.underline} is about two years in and
[should **[peak around 2025]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [although **cycle
25**]{.underline} [is [expected to be **stronger**]{.mark}]{.underline}
than its predecessor, it is still predicted to be feebler than average.

\"[There\'s a **few predictions** that \[cycle 25]{.underline}\]
**[might be strong]{.underline}**, [but **we\'ll wait**]{.underline} and
see,\" Mark Miesch, a space weather observer at the University of
Colorado Boulder, told Space.com.

Looking at the progression of the latest trend line, [cycle 25\'s
**[intensity]{.mark}**]{.underline} might [**[seem to be
higher]{.mark}** than expected]{.underline}. This apparently [high
activity is [partly]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} the
**[cycle]{.mark} [began]{.mark} around [six months
earlier]{.mark}**]{.underline} than scientists had anticipated --- a
natural difference, according to Miesch, who told Space.com that this
cycle so far is still within the range of most predictions.

**[Current trends]{.underline}** [point to the sun]{.underline}
[having]{.underline} about **[125 sunspots]{.underline}** [when cycle 25
**peaks**.]{.underline} That\'s more than the 115 sunspots visible at
the peak of cycle 24, but still much lower than the 180 of cycle 23,
which peaked in March 2000 and was about middling in recorded history.

Excitingly for some, the cycle 25 peak will likely occur around the same
time as the total solar eclipse of April 2024, which will be visible
from an arc across North America stretching from Sinaloa in Mexico to
Newfoundland in Canada. A more active sun sports a more dynamic corona,
the outer atmosphere of the sun that we can see only when the moon
blocks out the main disk.

\"We\'ll have a pretty interesting corona to see during the eclipse,\"
Miesch told Space.com.

In watching the sun, astronomers hope to gain more knowledge about the
long-term trends that potentially drive these cycles. Even though
scientists have compiled a continuous record of solar cycles back to the
mid-18th century, with occasional data from well before that date,
astronomers still don\'t know very much about how solar cycles change
and evolve over the long term.

For instance, over the past four solar cycles going back to the 1970s,
each successive cycle has had a weaker peak than its predecessor.

\"It\'s not very common to have a trend last more than four solar
cycles,\" Miesch told Space.com.

[If solar cycle 25 **turns out** to be stronger]{.underline} than its
predecessor, that weakening trend would end, supporting an idea called
the Gleissberg cycle. [This theory]{.underline} [holds that]{.underline}
cycles\' [**[peaks]{.mark} [grow stronger]{.mark}**
[then]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[weaken in]{.mark} a
[waveform]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} repeats

**[mimic]{.mark}** similarly]{.underline} [**weak cycles** in the early

[Solar cycle 25]{.underline} **[kicked off]{.underline}** [last

[than the **world\'s leading**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[experts]{.mark}** [predicted]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But while most space weather scientists are scratching their heads,
saying \"We still know very little about our star,\" one heliophysicist
has become the dark horse in space weather forecasting. His model of the
sun\'s behavior seems to have gotten it right.

A brief glance at the sun\'s radiant disk reveals little about the
star\'s dynamic life. As ordinary Earthlings, we feel more affected by
pesky clouds obstructing its rays. But astronomers equipped with
telescopes have known since the 17th century that the sun\'s surface
changes from day to day, breaking out with dark spots that grow and
shrink, change shape and move across the sun\'s surface, and disappear
over time to be replaced with new ones. Since 1749, astronomers have
been carefully recording those sunspots. By the middle of the 19th
century, they realized that the number and size of these spots ebbs and
flows following a roughly 11-year solar cycle. Since records began, the
star has completed 24 cycles, with cycle 25 currently underway.

But there is more to this ebb and flow. Just like the number of sunspots
grows and recedes within a single cycle, the productivity of these
cycles varies from one cycle to the next, following patterns that are
still little explored.

Cycle 24, which officially ended in December 2019 but overlapped with
the ensuing cycle 25 for quite a while, was one of the weakest on
record. [When a [**group of experts** from]{.mark} NASA]{.underline} and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [[came
**together** to **estimate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the sun\'s
activity]{.underline} for cycle 25, [they predicted]{.underline} [that
the **upcoming cycle**]{.underline} [would be just as
**weak**]{.underline}.

[[But]{.mark} at about]{.underline} [the **same time**]{.underline},
[[another **forecast came out**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Put together
by]{.underline} a team led by **[Scott McIntosh]{.underline}**, [a
**solar physicist** and **deputy director** of the U.S.
National]{.underline} [Center]{.underline} [for Atmospheric
Research]{.underline}, [[this forecast]{.underline}
**[predicted]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}]{.mark} exact
**[[opposite]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [that **[cycle
25]{.mark}**]{.underline} [might [be among **the stronger ones
in**]{.mark} **recorded [history]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

\"[We looked back over]{.underline} **[[140-plus years of
data]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about the **sun\'s magnetic
activity**]{.underline} and its relation to the number of sunspots,\"
McIntosh told Space.com. \"[And there was a **pattern**]{.underline}
[that [shaped]{.mark}]{.underline} [how large]{.underline} or small [the
**upcoming sunspot cycle**]{.underline} [was going to be.]{.underline}
[We predicted]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} same
[[pattern]{.mark} to **take place**]{.underline} [before solar cycle
25]{.underline}. Based on that, [we made a wild]{.underline} scientific
**[guess]{.underline}** [that [cycle 25]{.mark}]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} possibly [[be]{.mark} as **high as
[double]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the amplitude]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
**cycle 24**.\"]{.underline}

The team published their predictions in the journal Solar Physics(opens
in new tab) in November 2020. Since then, while experts at NOAA and NASA
were puzzled, McIntosh and his colleagues watched the sun do exactly
what they expected.

For example, whereas NOAA and NASA predicted a meager 27 sunspots for
December 2021, the sun produced 67 --- more than double the estimate.
And in May 2022, instead of the 37 sunspots predicted by NOAA and NASA,
there were 97, producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The
intense solar activity also caused geomagnetic storms on Earth, wreaking
havoc on satellites in orbit and triggering magnificent auroral
displays.

The official forecast for the peak of the solar maximum, which is
expected in April 2025, is 115 sunspots that month. But if the curve
follows the current trend, which reflects McIntosh and his team\'s
forecast(opens in new tab), the sun will easily reach 115 monthly
sunspots by the end of this year and peak two years later at over 210
monthly sunspots.

\"It\'s really wild that the sun continues to do this,\" McIntosh said.
\"Month after month, it continues to follow the track. But we\'ll see.
The sun sometimes does weird things, and the cycle could completely fall
over tomorrow.\"

**[Tzu-Wei Fang]{.underline}**, a [**space scientist** at
NOAA\'s]{.underline} Space Weather [Prediction Center]{.underline},
[agrees that the **official**]{.underline} solar [cycle forecast is
**not working**]{.underline} out and admits that scientists\' current
understanding of the factors driving the sun\'s behavior is rather
limited.

\"[We **don\'t know** what is driving]{.underline} [this]{.underline}
strong solar [activity]{.underline},\" Fang told Space.com. \"[[The
sun\'s behavior]{.underline} **[changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} [based
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} **[different [cycles]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[from **short cycles**]{.underline} [of 11 days to]{.underline} [long
cycles of **80 years**]{.underline}. [[There are **still a lot of
unknowns**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} we **just [don\'t
have]{.mark}**]{.underline} enough **[[data]{.mark}
points]{.underline}** or knowledge to \[accurately predict\] solar
activity.

Sunspots are cooler regions on the surface of the sun that can spawn
eruptive disturbances, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
