### Lines of Flight DA 

#### LINES OF FLIGHT DA: Framework is an instance of political narcissism that destroys radical potentialities and lines of flight from the debate space

**Evans and Reid 14** (Brad Evans \*Senior Lecturer in International
Studies at the University of Bristol, \*\* and Julian Reid, The Art of
Living Dangerously, 194-8, 2014)

Liberal regimes have moved way beyond the security imperative so
foundational to their origins, centuries ago, as the promise of security
which once appeared to legitimate them back then has been disintegrated
by a catastrophic imaginary that promotes what we have called insecurity
by design. What once appeared to be the promise of progress and worldly
transformation has given way to a full life crisis that offers us no
means for escape. This way of [treating liberalism, as a regime founded
on catastrophic promises and ruinous images, does not mean we are in
denial of the reality of the disastrous nature of the world we now
inhabit and which liberal regimes understand themselves as responding
to]{.underline}. [But it would be wrong to think we can distinguish
[between the real and]{.mark} the [imaginary. There is **no hard**
]{.mark}**and fast [distinction]{.mark}**,]{.underline} even though the
fact that we speak of the real and the imaginary indicates that they are
different. [We perceive and make sense of the real through images. [We
are]{.mark} **continuously [interpellated]{.mark}** [within 'regimes of
signs' that]{.mark} profoundly [influence our affective registries
and]{.mark} hence [our **sense of any** ]{.mark}**given
[situation]{.mark}** []{.mark}as it unfolds before us.]{.underline} And
so [[**the maps we construct to navigate**]{.mark} **the real [are
composed]{.mark}**]{.underline} only [[**of images**.]{.mark} Liberalism
itself, including its contemporary idea of the resilient subject, is a
product of the imaginary]{.underline}. And so now we inhabit its
nightmarish effects. Nor are the images through which we make sense of
and give representation to the real simply dependent on the real. If
anything, [the [images **precede the real**,]{.mark} making and shaping
it into what we come to name and know as the real, [producing it,
fabricating it,]{.mark} into the worlds we come to inhabit. The
catastrophic nature of the world we now do not so much possess as find
ourselves exposed and vulnerable to is of our own creation. It is a
world which appears every bit as much in our heads as much as our heads
are in this world, drowning in its images of impending disaster, species
extinction, tipping points and catastrophe effects. [The image and
reality of catastrophe are **ceaselessly interchanging**]{.mark} such
that the two are forever **interfused**.]{.underline} What we have
learnt to call ['[**the world' is the manifestation of that
interfusion**. Politics is]{.mark} an art of worldly transformation, and
transformation demands,]{.underline} \[p. 195\] [**first of all and
[fundamentally, a subject capable of conceiving the possibility
of]{.mark} worldly [transformation.]{.mark}** []{.mark}A subject that
sees the intolerability of the world as it is presently imagined and
demands the seemingly impossible; the creation of a new one. A subject
which affirms and follows the paths opened up to it by the visions of
other worlds which the play of images creates for it]{.underline}. And
[a subject which affirms the reality of the existence of different
worlds, their antagonisms, as well as tangibility and
reachability]{.underline}, so to say. What we call [the]{.underline}
[poetic subject]{.underline} therefore [seeks to have a **faith beyond
that which arises simply from endangerment**, as well as **rekindling**
long diminished understandings of political subjectivity. Its
diminishment owes everything not to the realities of a world which
demand an evacuation of the political, but to the]{.underline}
overwrought [influence of liberalism over our own self-understandings of
the limits of this world]{.underline}, its planetary boundaries, the
weight of finitude, [and the dangers which liberalism believes, and has
preached for some time,]{.underline} that the imagination poses to a
species equipped more than any other to transcend each and every
boundary, each and every limit, and lose all sense of its own finitude
and that of the world itself; the human. [We are now governed by
Ministries of Anxiety of multiple kinds, whose dominant strategic mantra
of resilience stems from the catastrophic imaginary of late liberal
rule. **[We only have to step back]{.mark} ever so slightly [from this
blackmail]{.mark}, however, [to see]{.mark} the [political
narcissism]{.mark} at work here**]{.underline}. [If we
take]{.underline}, for instance, [the idea of the full life crises
seriously, how might we conceive of the governance of the subject such
that it may once again conceive of better worlds to come?]{.underline}
Instead of demanding, for example, that impoverished children, who are
increasingly subjected to surveillance and lockdown conditions far
beyond the reaches of earlier penitentiary systems, accept the
vulnerabilities of their fate; what if they were instructed on the
virtues of critical pedagogy such that the confidence and the poetic
freedom to radically transform their lived \[p. 196\] condition was
merited? That is a situation which begins at the earliest stages of
development, wherein the transformative and critical power of
imagination is welcomed, and the quality of lives assessed in terms of
its poetic contributions. Pablo Picasso stated that 'all children are
artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up'. This
was not only a reflection on the power of the imagination. It is also
acknowledgement of the power of a critical subjectivity which, as
anybody who has a young child will testify, overwhelmingly appears when
the former is suffocated such that the latter is expressed as a form of
discontent for otherwise affirmative performances. But it also needs to
be more than this. That is why [exhaustion is fundamental to thinking
about the poetic]{.underline}, for it allows us to take it out of the
realms of fleeting abstraction. The art for living poetically needs to
be crafted as a lifetime work. It must not be reduced to some Warholian
commodifiable chancery that lasts but 15 minutes. In this sense, the
diagnosis of the contemporary degradations of human experience, which we
have sought to provide here, remains an argument with the legacies of
Immanuel Kant. The Kantian enlightenment, if we want to give it that
absurdly paradoxical name, gave licence to human beings to speculate on
the possibility of other worlds but always with the insistence that this
world, as it is supposedly known, is the only world that can be. [The
possibility of another world is thinkable only within this world we
inhabit, Kant said, and thus the possible has to always be suborned to
the actual. The corollary of the possibility of us conceiving another
world is the impossibility of us moving beyond this world, the world, as
it is known and said to be.]{.underline} Thus understood, [it was and
still is [a]{.mark} powerful and [demeaning discourse on limits]{.mark},
one which [forces us to accept our sense of the limits of this world as
an imperious necessity]{.mark} without which we cannot think or act or
indeed, **imagine**. [Its influence]{.mark} goes some way to
[explain]{.mark}ing [why]{.mark} [the world]{.mark} we live in [has
become]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[so **depoliticized**, so absent of
any]{.mark} sense of tangible]{.underline} \[p. 197\] [[alternatives,
and **crucially, subjects capable of creating**]{.mark} **and
establishing [them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [When one reads back through
the history of liberal thought, what's striking is the extent to which
this project of constituting a subject of limits required a wholesale
**pathologization** **of the human imagination**]{.underline}. [Kant was
a very sober man, for a reason. What existence beyond the harmonious
regulation of the faculty of reason was to be feared; its abilities to
incite the imagination, the wildness of what we see and feel, the
freedom it gives us, and sense of increased vital force which leads us
to follow the trajectories it opens up for us. We all know]{.underline},
or should know, [the experience that arises from [freeing
ourselves]{.mark} and welcoming]{.underline} new experiences[, and the
ways in which it **[enables us to see the world differently, as well as
act]{.mark} and speak [differently, on account of the images it induces
in us]{.mark}**. There has to be an art to these imaginaries, and we
have to be able to discern the differences between the subjective states
we encounter in ourselves and each other under their influence. **[The
war on the imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Kant and his
disciplines]{.underline} [inaugurated [was]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[an attempt to **govern truth**]{.mark}, practices of truth-telling,
and human relations to truth. It is not that the Enlightenment forbids
us to tell truth, but that it sought to govern its production, and to
subject it to a new regime of biopolitical power relations.]{.underline}
For truth to be truth, Kant said, it had to be allied not simply to the
world, but to the life of the world, or better understood, a world which
itself is finite and living, requiring care and protection, vulnerable
to the destructive potential of the maps and trajectories human beings
impose on it on account of the power of their visions of what it can
become. Today it is apparent, and we have sought to reveal, that the
name we give to that Kantian conception of the world as a living being
is the biosphere. Biospheric life is the vulnerable guide of the Kantian
subject of liberal modernity. As living beings, so the story goes, our
time cannot be indifferently dispersed and scattered. We have not just a
path to follow, but a movement by which we might learn to follow life
\[p. 198\] along that path, by accepting the reality that we owe our
life, its sustenance and survival, finitely, to the world on which our
paths are inscribed. Sustainable development is the name we give, today,
to the Kantian conception of truth. The discourse on worldliness, and
the prescription of the limits of the human imagination, is underwritten
by a claim as to the infinite debt of all finite beings to the
biosphere. The truths we can tell of this world and those to come have
to be said in recognition of our debt and responsibility to it in all
its finitude, vulnerability and limits. Now it seems to us that this
original investment of Kant and others in biospheric life is what
accounts for the fundamental antinomy between political and liberal
subjectivity. An antinomy which continues to shape the antagonism
between the neoliberalism analysed here in this book, the subject it
calls into being globally today, and the erstwhile political subject of
modernity that we have attempted to recover the lost signs of in this
text.
