2.8 CHOOSING CAPITALISM TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT: LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENT

Finally, a third reason that [**[cap]{.mark}**italism [is **suited
to**]{.mark} the job of **[environmental]{.mark}
restoration**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is its ability to
**undertake**]{.underline} [and complete]{.underline} **[projects at
very large scales]{.underline}**. In keeping with a major thesis of this
book, construction at very large scales should give us a little pause,
because of the propensity of capital to metastasize into a source of
political resistance to change. But some global problems, especially
climate change, may require very large-scale enterprises.

For example, [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[[already]{.underline}]{.mark}**
have [**[passed a threshold]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[tech]{.mark}**nology
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost certainly [**[needed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [chemically]{.underline} **[[capture
carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline}** [from ambient air.]{.underline}
But carbon dioxide is only about 0.15% of ambient air by molecular
weight, and [a tremendous amount of]{.underline} ambient [air must be
processed just to capture a small amount of carbon dioxide]{.underline}.
This technology has often been referred to as \"**[direct air
capture]{.underline}**,\" or \"carbon removal.\" [Given
that]{.underline} inherent [limitation, direct air capture technology
[must be deployed **at vast scales**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to
make any appreciable difference in greenhouse gas concentrations. There
is certainly no guarantee that direct air capture will be a silver
bullet. But [if it is to be an effectual item on a menu of survival
techniques, it will [more **assured**]{.mark}ly be accomplished
[under]{.mark} the]{.underline} incentives of [a **[cap]{.mark}**italist
**economy**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism might]{.underline} [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [help with
the looming crisis of climate change by helping to]{.underline}
**[[ensure]{.mark} the [supply of]{.mark}]{.underline}** vital life
staples such as [**[food, water]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [other basic needs in future
**[shortages]{.mark}**]{.underline} [caused by
climate-change]{.underline}. [In a climate-changed future, there is
the]{.underline} distinct [possibility that supplies of vital life
staples may run short]{.underline}, possibly for long periods of time.
[**Droughts** are projected]{.underline} to last longer, with water
supplies and growing conditions increasingly precarious. [Capitalist
enterprise could]{.underline}, first of all, [provide the]{.underline}
[**impetus to** finally **reform**]{.underline} a dizzying multitude of
**[price distortions]{.underline}** [that plague **water** supply and
**ag**riculture]{.underline} worldwide. Second, **[capitalist
enterprise]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} **[undertake scale
production]{.underline}** [of some emergent technologies that might
alleviate shortages.]{.underline} [**Desal**ination
technology]{.underline} [can convert salty seawater into]{.underline}
drinkable [freshwater]{.underline}.54 A number of environmental and
economic issues need to be solved to deploy these technologies at large
scales, but [in a crisis]{.underline}, [**solutions will** be more
**likely to present themselves**]{.underline}.

[A technology that is already being adopted]{.underline} to produce food
[is the modernized version of old-fashioned greenhouses.]{.underline}
The tiny country of the Netherlands, with its 17 million people crowded
onto 13,000 square miles, is the second largest food exporter in the
world,55 exporting fully three-quarters that of the United States in
2017.56 The secret to Dutch agriculture is its climate-controlled,
low-energy green-houses that project solar panel-powered artificial
sunlight around the clock. Dutch greenhouses produce lettuce at ten
times the yield57 and tomatoes at fifteen times the yield outdoors in
the United States58 while using less than one-thirteenth the amount of
water,59 very little in the way of synthetic pesticides and, of course,
very little fertilizer given its advanced composting techniques.
[Sustained shortages in a climate-changed future might require that
a]{.underline} **[capitalist]{.underline}** [take hold of **greenhouse
growing and expand production**]{.underline} **[to feed the
masses]{.underline}** [that might otherwise revolt]{.underline}.

2.9 **[CHOOSE CAPITALISM]{.underline}**

[Clearly, the job]{.underline} in front of humankind [is enormous,
complex, and many-faceted]{.underline}. The best hope is to be able to
identify certain human impacts that are clearly harmful to the global
environment, and to disincentivize them. Getting back to notions of
institutions in capitalism, [what is crucial is aligning the right
incentives with profit-making activity]{.underline}. [What capitalism
does **so well**]{.underline} --- beyond human comprehension --- **[is
coordinate activity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[send broad
signals about scarcity]{.underline}**. [Information about a wide variety
of environmental phenomena is]{.underline} extremely [difficult to
collect and process]{.underline}. If a set of environmental taxes can
help establish a network of environ-mental prices, then an unfathomably
large and complex machinery will have been set in motion in the right
direction.

Also, [because of the need for new scientific solutions to this daunting
list of problems, **[new science and tech]{.mark}**nology [is]{.mark}
desperately [**needed**. **Cap**]{.mark}italism **[is tried and
true]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} terms of **[producing
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again drawing upon the study of
institutions, it is not so much that individuals need a profit-motive in
order to tinker, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [the prospect of
**[profit]{.mark}**-making **[has to be present]{.mark}** in order for
institutions]{.underline}, including corporations, [to devote resources,
attention, and energy towards the development of solutions]{.underline}
to environmental problems. Corporations can and should demonstrate
social responsibility by attempting to mitigate their impacts on the
global environment, but a much more conscious push for new knowledge,
new techniques, and new solutions are needed.

Finally, **[the scale of needed change is profound]{.underline}**. [Huge
networks of infrastructure]{.underline} centered upon a fossil
fuel-centered economy [must]{.underline} somehow [be replaced or
adapted]{.underline} to new ways of generating, transmitting, consuming,
and storing energy. [A global system of feeding seven billion
humans]{.underline} (and counting), unsustainable on its face, [must be
morphed into something else that]{.underline} can fill that huge role.
[About a billion and a half cars and trucks]{.underline} in the world
[must]{.underline}, over time, [be swapped out]{.underline} for vehicles
that must be dramatically different.

[This is a daunting to-do list]{.underline}, **[but look]{.underline}**
a bit more **[carefully]{.underline}** among the gloomy news. Elon
[Musk]{.underline}, a freewheeling, pot-smoking entrepreneur [shows
signs of breaking into not one, but two industries]{.underline}
dominated by behemoths with political power. Thanks to California
emissions standards, [**auto**mobile manufacturers have developed [cars
that emit a **fraction**]{.mark} of what they did]{.underline} less than
a generation ago. [Hybrid **[e]{.mark}**lectric
**[v]{.mark}**ehicle**[s]{.mark}** have]{.underline} thoroughly
[penetrated an American market that powerful American politicians had
tried to cordon off]{.underline} for American manufacturers only. [At
least two companies have developed **[meat substitutes]{.mark}** that
are]{.underline} now widely judged to be [indistinguishable from
meat]{.underline}, and have established product outposts in the ancient
power centers of fast food, McDonald\'s and Burger King. The tiny
country of [the **Netherlands**]{.underline}, about half the size of
West Virginia, [exports almost **as much [food]{.mark}** []{.mark}as the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, able to ship fresh
produce all the way to Africa. At bottom, **[all of [these
accomplishments]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thousands more
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** and were **[[capitalist]{.mark} in
nature.]{.underline}** While they collectively repre-sent a trifle of
what still needs to be accomplished, [they were also undertaken without
the correct incentives in place, and]{.underline} thus also [represent
the]{.underline} tremendous **[promise of capitalism]{.underline}**.

#### [Best studies]{.underline}.

Hideo **Noda &** Shigeru **Kano 21**, Tokyo University of Science; The
Shoko Chukin Bank, \"Environmental Economic Modeling of Sustainable
Growth and Consumption in a Zero-Emission Society,\" Journal of Cleaner
Production, Vol. 299, 05/25/2021, pg. 1-2.

Manufacturing [activities that]{.underline} **[pollute]{.underline}**
[the soil, atmosphere, and water have]{.underline} **[adversely
affected]{.underline}** [the environment]{.underline}. The [abatement of
pollution is]{.underline} therefore **[essential]{.underline}** [to
maintaining]{.underline} **[environmental standards]{.underline}** in
the future. The purpose of this paper is to examine what kind of
economic conditions should be satisfied if an economy adopts a rule
stating that pollution must be cleaned up when it is produced, and
whether the [zero net emission of pollution]{.underline} flow (in the
sense of a zero residual amount of pollution created minus pollution
abated) [is]{.underline} **[compatible]{.underline}** [with the
continued]{.underline} **[growth of]{.underline}** gross domestic
product (**[GDP]{.underline}**) [and consumption when]{.underline} the
[economy]{.underline} **[experiences]{.underline}** [cyclical
fluctuations]{.underline}.

A detailed understanding of the economic implications of cyclical
fluctuations is crucial because [actual economies]{.underline}
**[inevitably]{.underline}** [undergo]{.underline} cycles of
**[expansion]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[recession]{.underline}**. In this respect, [on the basis of
the]{.underline} **[laboratory equipment]{.underline}** model of
Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991), Matsuyama (1999) [[construct]{.mark}ed a
useful [model]{.mark} that [generates]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[endo]{.mark}genous [fluctuations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Notably,
[under specific conditions]{.underline}, an [economy can]{.underline}
**[perpetually]{.underline}** [oscillate between]{.underline} a
capital-**[accumulation]{.underline}**-based (no-innovation) [growth
phase and]{.underline} **[innovation]{.underline}**-led [growth
phase]{.underline}. The former phase is called the Solow regime, after
the work of Solow (1956), while the latter phase is called the Romer
regime, after the work of Romer (1990) and Rivera-Batiz and Romer
(1991).

However, Matsuyama (1999) did not pay attention to environmental aspects
in a society. We therefore [[extend]{.mark} the model]{.underline} of
Matsuyama (1999) [[by]{.mark} [considering]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[pollution abatement]{.underline}**]{.mark} from the perspective of
the kindergarten rule model of Brock and Taylor (2005). We thereby
[expect to obtain]{.underline} **[meaningful]{.underline}** [findings by
analyzing]{.underline} **[endogenous fluctuations]{.underline}** [with
pollution abatement, which has [not]{.mark} been [tackled]{.mark}
in]{.underline} **[[earlier]{.mark} studies]{.underline}**. The term
"kindergarten rule" originates from the title of a book written by
Fulghum (1990) and implies that messes be cleaned up as they are
created. Brock and Taylor (2005) referred to the proportion of pollution
abatement expenditure in GDP for achieving zero net emissions of
pollution (i.e., completely eliminating the amount of pollution created
minus pollution abated) as the kindergarten rule level of abatement (or
just the kindergarten rule).

Ono (2003) extended Matsuyama's (1999) model to analyze endogenous
fluctuations by accounting for environmental variables. Specifically,
Ono (2003) incorporated the production structure of Matsuyama (1999)
into the framework of the overlapping generations model on the basis of
the work of John and Pecchenino (1994) and examined environmental
taxation that maximizes the environmental quality and economic growth
rate. It is found that [there is [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[critical
level]{.underline}**]{.mark} of tax, [and the [economy
achieves]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[higher]{.underline}**
[growth]{.underline}]{.mark} [rates of GDP [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[environment]{.mark}al [quality]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by
raising]{.underline} (or reducing) tax [if the]{.underline} initial [tax
is]{.underline} **[below]{.underline}** (or above) [the critical
level]{.underline}. That is to say, the purpose of the present study
differs from that of the study of Ono (2003). We [analyze
the]{.underline} **[feasibility]{.underline}** [of the positive growth
of GDP with]{.underline} **[zero net emission]{.underline}** [that
reflects the]{.underline} **[kindergarten rule]{.underline}** [of
pollution abatement]{.underline}, while Ono (2003) focused on taxation
for improving environmental quality and promoting economic growth.
Recent efforts toward a zero-emission society, which are an important
topic of the Paris Agreement that came into force on November 4, 2016,
have received worldwide attention (see, for example, Pauli, 1997;
Baumgartner and Zielowski, 2007; Tokimatsu et al., 2014). The present
study is therefore of social importance and relevant. Additionally, we
consider that the notion of environmental quality is vague and hence
difficult to capture empirically. In contrast, the zero net emission of
pollution has clear meaning.

Related studies of environment-growth models with endogenous
fluctuations include those conducted by Zhang (1999), Chen and Li
(2011), and Palivos and Varvarigos (2017). Zhang (1999), for example,
examined the possibility of nonlinear dynamics in the model of John and
Pecchenino (1994) and showed that cyclically or chaotically fluctuating
equilibria are more likely to exist when people's concerns are more
towards greener preferences and the maintenance efficiency relative to
degradation is not sufficiently high. Chen and Li (2011) introduced the
habit formation of environmental quality and consumption tax to the
model of John and Pecchenino (1994). The habit formation of
environmental quality in the model of Chen and Li (2011) means that
people get used to the environment while they grow up and will compare
environmental quality in their old age with that when they were young.
As a result, Chen and Li (2011) showed that cyclical fluctuations and
entropic chaos may exist if households have a preference towards
environmental quality and the maintenance efficiency is sufficiently low
relative to degradation and the tax rate. The economy moves from complex
to simple dynamics as the tax rate increases. Using an overlapping
generations model where life expectancy is positively affected by the
provision of public health services and by the environmental quality,
Palivos and Varvarigos (2017) showed that, despite the presence of an
aggregate learning-by-doing externality, the economy cannot sustain a
positive growth rate in the long run if resources are not devoted to
environmental preservation. Moreover, an active policy of environmental
preservation is not only an important complementary engine of long-run
growth but also a powerful tool of stabilization.

Zhang (1999), Chen and Li (2011), and Palivos and Varvarigos (2017),
however, did not consider the role of innovation in economic growth.
When we consider issues related to recent economic growth, it is
noteworthy that the [economic [activities]{.mark} of industries
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[developed]{.underline}**
[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} and some developing countries [have
increasingly [become]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[knowledge
intensive]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The [economies of these countries
are]{.underline} often [termed]{.underline} **[knowledge-based
economies]{.underline}**. An [important feature]{.underline} of such an
economy [is]{.underline} that [it [emphasizes]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[innovation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [including the]{.underline}
**[[creat]{.mark}ion]{.underline}** [of [new products and]{.mark}
production [processes]{.mark} through]{.underline} industrial research
and development (**[R&D]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline} the
[innovation is [accompanied by]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[accumulated
knowledge]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that drives]{.underline}
**[sustained]{.underline}** [growth]{.underline}. Accordingly, any study
on the actual economic problems of a knowledge-based economy needs to
construct a model that endogenously incorporates R&D and innovation.
From such a perspective, the above-mentioned [[earlier studies]{.mark}
are]{.underline} **[[inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terms of
understanding]{.underline} the [relationship between]{.underline}
**[contemporary]{.underline}** economic [growth and environmental
problems]{.underline}.

Our model leads to the theoretical possibility that the [[zero net
emission]{.mark} of pollution flow [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[compatible]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [sustainable
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline} and consumption. In this regard, however,
[the economy]{.underline} **[[requires GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}** above
a certain level. Moreover, [to]{.underline}
**[simultaneously]{.underline}** [achieve]{.underline} a [zero net
emission of pollution and sustained]{.underline} economic [growth, the
economy requires]{.underline} **[variability]{.underline}** [of the
kindergarten rule]{.underline} **[level of abatement]{.underline}**. In
other words, the kindergarten rule level of abatement must not be fixed
at a specific value. The present study makes two main contributions.
First, we shed light on the relationship between the zero net emission
of pollution and economic growth, which is not well understood, and
address theoretically an important subject interesting environmental
scientists, economists, and policy makers: whether both a zero net
emission of pollution and sustained growth of GDP (consumption) are
achievable when economies implement a zero net emission policy. In terms
of the association with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 and
have received international attention, our considerations are conducive
to providing a theoretical basis for a part of SDG 8 ("Decent Work and
Economic Growth"). Second, we present a dynamic macro-environmental
modeling approach based on an extension to Matsuyama's (1999) model with
the idea of the kindergarten rule of Brock and Taylor (2005). To the
best of our knowledge, there have been few studies on the environmental
economic modeling of endogenous growth with cyclical fluctuations in a
zero-emission society. That is to say, our dynamic macroenvironmental
modeling approach can be interpreted as a methodological contribution in
the research field of economic growth and the environment.

The [past 30 years have seen immense progress **in [improving]{.mark}
the [quality of life]{.mark} for much of humanity**.]{.underline}
Extreme [[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the number of people living
on less than \$1.90 per day --- [has fallen by nearly two-thirds, [from
1.9 **billion to**]{.mark} around [650 **million**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Life expectancy has risen]{.underline}]{.mark} in most of the world,
[along with literacy and access to education]{.underline}, [while infant
mortality has fallen]{.underline}. Despite perceptions to the contrary,
**[the average person born today is likely to have access to more
opportunities and have a [better]{.mark} quality of [life than at any
other point]{.mark} in human history]{.underline}**. [Much of this
increase in human wellbeing has been [propelled by]{.mark} rapid
[economic growth]{.mark} driven largely by state-led industrial policy,
particularly in poor-to-middle income countries.]{.underline} However,
[this growth has come at a cost]{.underline}: [between 1990 and
2019]{.underline}, global [emissions of CO2 **increased by
56%.**]{.underline} [Historically, economic growth has been closely
linked to increased energy consumption]{.underline} --- and increased
CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a more
prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our natural
environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about our
ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is, the
extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues[. [Over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [past 15 [years,]{.mark} however, **[something
has begun to change]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Rather than a 21st century
dominated by coal that energy modelers foresaw, **[global [coal]{.mark}
use peaked in 2013 and is now [in]{.mark} [structural
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [We have succeeded in making [clean
energy cheap]{.mark}, with solar power and battery storage [costs
falling]{.mark} 10-fold since 2009]{.underline}. The world produced more
electricity from clean energy --- [solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear ---
than from coal over the past two years]{.underline}. And, according to
some major oil companies, **[peak [oil]{.mark} is upon us]{.underline}**
--- not because we have run out of cheap oil to produce, but because
[[demand is falling]{.mark} and [companies expect further
decline]{.mark} as consumers increasingly shift to electric
vehicles.]{.underline} The [world has long been experiencing a relative
**[decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} economic [growth
and]{.mark} CO2 [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [with the
emissions per unit of GDP **falling for the past 60
years**]{.underline}. [This is the case even in countries
like]{.underline} **[India and China]{.underline}** that [have been
undergoing rapid]{.underline} economic [growth.]{.underline} But
relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a world where global CO2
emissions need to peak and decline in the next decade to give us any
chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in line with Paris
Agreement targets. Thankfully, there is increasing evidence that [the
world is [on track **to absolutely decouple**]{.mark} **CO2 emissions
and economic growth**]{.underline} --- with global [CO2
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially having [[peaked in
2019]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and [unlikely to increase]{.mark}
substantially [in the coming decade]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While an
emissions peak is just the first and easiest step towards eventually
reaching the net-zero emissions required to stop the world from
continuing to warm, it [demonstrates that linkages between emissions and
economic activity are not an immutable law, but rather simply a result
of our current means of energy production.]{.underline} In recent years
we have seen more and more examples of absolute decoupling --- economic
growth accompanied by falling CO2 emissions. [Since 2005,]{.underline}
[[32 countries]{.mark} with a population of at least one million people
**have [absolutely decoupled]{.mark}**]{.underline} emissions from
economic growth, both for terrestrial emissions (those within national
borders) and consumption emissions (emissions embodied in the goods
consumed in a country). This includes the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Japan, Mexico, Germany, U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, [France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Netherlands,
Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria, Bulgaria, El
Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway, Ireland, New
Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, and
Cyprus.]{.underline} Figure 1, below, shows the declines in territorial
emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red). To qualify as having
experienced absolute decoupling, we require countries included in this
analysis to pass four separate filters: a population of at least one
million (to focus the analysis on more representative cases), [declining
territorial emissions over the 2005-2019 period (based on a linear
regression), declining consumption emissions, and increasing real GDP
(on a purchasing power parity basis, using constant 2017 international
\$USD).]{.underline} We chose not to include 2020 in this analysis
because it is not particularly representative of longer-term trends, and
consumption and territorial emissions estimates are not yet available
for many countries. There is a wide range of rates of economic growth
between 2005-2019 among countries experiencing absolute decoupling.
Somewhat counterintuitively, there is no significant relationship
between the rate of economic growth and the magnitude of emissions
reductions within the group. **[While it is unlikely that there is not
at least some linkage between the two factors, there are plenty of
examples of countries (e.g., Singapore, Romania, and Ireland)
experiencing both extremely rapid economic growth and large reductions
in CO2 emissions.]{.underline}** One of the [primary [criticisms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} some prior analyses of absolute [[decoupling
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that they ignore
**[[leakage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, the offshoring of
manufacturing from high-income countries over the past three decades to
countries like China has led to "illusory" drops in emissions, where the
emissions associated with high-income country consumption are simply
shipped overseas and no longer show up in territorial emissions
accounting. There is some truth in this critique, as there was a large
increase in emissions embodied in imports from developing countries
between 1990 and 2005. After 2005, however, [structural changes in China
and a growing domestic market led to a reversal of these trends; the
[amount of emissions "exported"]{.mark} from developed countries to
developing countries **[has]{.mark} actually [declined]{.mark} over the
past 15 years.**]{.underline} This means that, for many countries, [both
territorial emissions and consumption emissions]{.underline} (which
include any emissions "exported" to other countries) **[have jointly
declined]{.underline}**. In fact, on average, consumption emissions have
been declining slightly faster than territorial emissions since 2005 in
the 32 countries we identify as experiencing absolute decoupling. Figure
2, below, shows the change in consumption emissions (teal) and GDP (red)
between 2005 and 2019. There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to
which these countries have reduced their territorial and consumption
emissions since 2005. Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark,
Finland, and Singapore -- have seen territorial emissions fall faster
than consumption emissions, while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain
(among others) have seen consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3
shows reductions in consumption and territorial emissions for each
country, with the size of the dot representing the size of the
population in 2019. **[[Absolute decoupling is
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [There is no physical law requiring
economic growth --- and broader increases in human wellbeing --- to
necessarily be linked to CO2 emissions]{.underline}. All of the
**[[services that we rely on today]{.mark} that emit fossil
fuels]{.underline}** --- electricity, transportation, heating, food ---
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} in principle **[[be replaced by]{.mark}
near-[zero carbon alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though these are
more mature in some sectors (electricity, transportation, buildings)
than in others (industrial processes, agriculture).

emissions have fallen by around 30%, **[while [GDP]{.mark} has

there are a wide variety of drivers of UK emissions reductions, though
renewable energy generation, reductions in electricity use, and
reductions in industrial and residential energy use are the largest
contributors.

that France has seen larger emission reductions --- as a percentage of
total emissions --- than Germany over this period, likely due in part to
Germany's choice to prioritize shutting down nuclear power plants over
coal ones.

1.2.3 Four Additional Arguments

There are four additional [arguments made by]{.underline} degrowth and
[revolution proponents]{.underline} that are [worth responding to. (1)
Climate change is not the only crisis; (2) The costs of climate
stabilization]{.underline} will [cancel out economic growth; (3)
Sufficient absolute decoupling has]{.underline} not
[happened]{.underline} in the past, [and]{.underline} thus [is unlikely
to happen]{.underline} in the future; [and (4) Developed economies must
reach net-zero]{.underline} emissions by 2030.

First, [practically all]{.underline} degrowth and revolution proponents
[point out that **climate change** is not the only environmental crisis.
It is just one of the "nine **planetary boundaries**]{.underline}." The
planetary boundaries framework was developed by Earth systems scientists
in the late 2000s (Rockström et al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2015). Each
boundary represents a natural process or cycle on which humans depend.
Together, they define "a safe operating space for humanity for human
societies to develop and thrive" (Steffen et al. 2015, 1).
"Transgressing a boundary," according to Will Steffen, lead author of
the 2015 update to the framework, "increases the risk that human
activities could inadvertently drive the Earth system 1.2.4 Structural
Change

[Revolution proponents are clear about the need to **abolish
capitalism**]{.underline}. Degrowth proponents focus less on capitalism
and more on economic growth, but most still understand that capitalism
is a growth-based system that is inconsistent with degrowth. For
example, Jackson (2016) states, "The capitalist model appears to have no
easy route towards a steady state position. Its natural dynamics seem to
push it towards one of two states: expansion or collapse" (Ch. 4).
Hickel (2020) states more explicitly that "we must take steps to evolve
beyond capitalism" (Ch. 6).

[Moving [beyond capitalism is]{.mark} an **[enormous
task]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As evidence, [one only needs to realize
that [the world is]{.mark} still [**predominantly capitalist**,
surviving centuries of]{.mark} **[attempted revolutions]{.mark}**.
Nonetheless,]{.underline} both degrowth and revolution [proponents
argue]{.underline} that [their approaches will make climate
stabilization easier]{.underline}. According to Foster (2017), "There
are better and faster ways of addressing the climate crisis through
revolutions in social relations themselves." Any non-revolutionary
strategy "represents a failure of nerve." According to Victor (2012), "A
slower rate of economic growth requires a slower and, arguably, more
manageable rate of transformation of the economy and society" (208).
Hickel (2020) argues similarly: "The less energy we use, the easier it
is to achieve a rapid transition to renewables" (Ch. 5). If they are
right, then whether or not degrowth or revolution is necessary is a moot
point. In this section, I examine degrowth and revolution proponents'
proposed action plans, i.e., what societies should do right now to
address climate change, to understand the implied structural change of
their plans. In doing so, I demonstrate that [their [plans would]{.mark}
in fact [make climate]{.mark} stabilization **far [more
difficult]{.mark}**.a much **[less hospitable]{.mark}** state,
**damaging** efforts to **reduce poverty** and [leading to]{.mark} a
**[deterioration]{.mark}** of **human wellbeing**]{.underline}"
(Stockholm 2015). As of 2015, four boundaries have been crossed: climate
change, biodiversity loss, biogeochemical flows (i.e., the phosphorous
and nitrogen cycles), and land-system change. Climate change and
biodiversity loss are considered "core boundaries." Transgressing one of
these boundaries for too long (humanity has transgressed both), "has the
potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state"
(Steffen et al. 2015, 1).

[Revolution]{.underline} and degrowth [proponents argue]{.underline}
that [even if solving climate change is possible within capitalism,
doing so will not solve these other crises, and leaving capitalism
intact]{.underline} will only create more crises in the future. [At the
same time, they focus **mostly** on **climate change** in their own
work.]{.underline} This makes sense---climate change is [the most urgent
and potentially catastrophic of the environmental crises]{.underline}
facing humanity. In addition, [climate change overlaps with other
crises. Solving climate change will also **make substantial progress**
towards solving ocean **acidification** and slowing the sixth **mass
extinction**]{.underline} (Steffen et al. 2015; Cahill et al. 2013).
Thus, [humanity should focus disproportionate efforts on the climate
crisis]{.underline} in particular. While the planetary boundaries
framework does not support the claim that climate stabilization in
particular requires moving beyond capitalism, it does support the claim
that capitalism has a strong tendency towards environmental degradation
in general, which outpaces any counter-tendencies. That is, thinking
longer-term, to achieve general sustainability, societies will likely
have to dismantle and replace capitalism.

Second, the costs of climate stabilization are sometimes treated as pure
costs. That is, stabilizing the climate will bring about only climate
benefits, not economic benefits, and thus will negatively impact
economic growth. Both Victor (2012) and Jackson (2016) express this
view. However, [[investments in **climate mitigation**]{.mark} should be
viewed as investments. These investments [are
**substantial**]{.mark}]{.underline}---in the range of 2-2.5% of GDP per
year to achieve the 1.5 °C target (Pollin 2019b; Jacobson et al. 2019).
But [they can be expected to [generate]{.mark} **millions of
[jobs]{.mark}**, create a more **[efficient energy]{.mark} system**,
stimulate a [new]{.mark} wave of **[techn]{.mark}ological innovation**,
[and save **millions**]{.mark} **of lives** every year from **reduced
air pollution**]{.underline}. Jacobson et al. (2019), for example,
estimates that a [100% clean energy transition will reduce private
energy costs]{.underline} from \$18 trillion to \$7 trillion per year.
In addition, a substantial portion of clean energy investments will be
matched by a decline in fossil fuel investments.

Third, degrowth [proponents regularly cite]{.underline} the fact [that
sufficient absolute decoupling has not occurred, and use it to support
their claim that it cannot occur]{.underline} (e.g., Kallis 2011;
Jackson 2016; Schor and Jorgenson 2019a, 2019b). The
[**[modelling]{.mark}** and **evidence**]{.underline} presented in
Sections 1.2.1.2 and 1.2.1.3 [[disputes]{.mark} these [claims]{.mark},
showing]{.underline} that [a **global climate stabilization program**
amounting to [1.5-]{.mark}2.5% of global [GDP]{.mark} per year [can
achieve]{.mark} **sufficient [absolute
decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Finally, [revolution]{.underline} and degrowth [[proponents]{.mark} tend
to [use **extreme**]{.mark} **climate [projections]{.mark}**, especially
[for]{.mark} **developed economies**]{.underline}. For example, Jackson
and Victor (2019) and Kallis (2020) [argue that developed economies must
achieve net-zero]{.underline} emission [by 2030]{.underline}. The logic
behind this claim is that developing economies should be allowed to
continue increasing emissions for years to come. Schor and Jorgenson
(2019a) and Malm (2014) cite a 2012 paper by Kevin Anderson
[suggesting]{.mark} that for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 2 °C,
net-zero emissions must be achieved globally between 2035 and 2045.
Foster et al. (2011) quote climate scientist James Hansen, who claims,
"the only resolution \[to climate change\] is for humans to move to a
fundamentally different energy system within a decade." Foster et al.
then claim, "this raises the question of more revolutionary social
change as an ecological as well as social necessity" (Ch. 6). [The
[IPCC]{.mark}]{.underline} (2018b), [widely considered the **gold
standard** for climate science **research**, [disputes]{.mark} these
claims. According to the IPCC, [for]{.mark} an even chance]{.underline}
of limiting warming [to 1.5 °C]{.underline} above preindustrial levels,
[humanity must achieve net-zero carbon emissions **around 2050**. For [2
°C]{.mark}, this is]{.underline} pushed [[back to
**2070**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Developed economies should certainly be
more ambitious, but rather than allowing developing economies to
continue to develop on dirty energy, a better approach is to provide
them with the necessary resources to develop on clean energy. Finally,
even if it turns out that Kevin Anderson is right, attempting to achieve
degrowth or a revolution would only add to the challenge. This is shown
in the next section.
