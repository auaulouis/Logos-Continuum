#### Ableist rhetoric feeds the project of the war machine as we march towards the horizon of a new Able-bodied world order. Rejecting attempts at "rehabilitation" is key to understanding debility as inherent to all bodies and deconstructing the project of the war machine.

["\[B\]etween fixing and forgetting]{.underline} ... [\[s\]uccessful
[rehabilitation permitted]{.mark} the ['formerly' disabled
body]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[be]{.mark} reintegrated into]{.underline}
the nation's significant [social structures, such as work and
family]{.underline}. [[Made 'ordinary' again]{.underline}]{.mark},
'identical' to 'normal' citizens, [[the disabled would
'disappear']{.underline}]{.mark}". 57 Jennifer [[James' account of the
relationship between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[disabled]{.mark} body,
[black bodies]{.mark} [in the US]{.mark}, [and soldier/citizenship draws
out]{.mark} [the]{.mark} complicated [structural history]{.mark} of
[soldier/citizens in the US]{.mark}. [She argues]{.mark}
[fo]{.mark}r]{.underline} recognition of the [[history of blackness in
the US to be understood as 'synonymous with disability']{.mark} as
'[black men have envisaged military participation as an avenue toward
liberation and citizenship, heeding the call for "able-bodied"
men]{.mark} needed [to fill military ranks]{.mark}']{.underline}. 58
Through an analysis of the literary texts of Gwendolyn Brooks, [[James
argues for]{.mark} the need for [representation]{.mark},]{.underline}
rather than repression, [[of the injured and maimed black body returned
from war]{.underline}.]{.mark} As such, [[James demonstrates the
relationship]{.underline} [between]{.underline}]{.mark} [legal
[subjectivity,]{.mark} citizenship, [and soldiering]{.mark} in the
US.]{.underline} In arguing that military service might 'undo' the
othering of the black male body in the US, James in effect acknowledges
the white, masculine subject of law who need not act to gain full
subjectivity. However, James also challenges the accuracy of
'"ableists'" representations' for 'the act of representation, no matter
how "authentic," aids in this estrangement precisely because the
disabled are mediated'. 59 [[The military mindset to repair and restore
the returned soldier through]{.mark} assistive [tech]{.mark}nologies
likewise [reproduces the expectation that the maimed body is not]{.mark}
quite [a full subject]{.mark} [and]{.mark} that the [restoring]{.mark}
of t[he body is necessary to be a full citizen]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark} approach,]{.underline} argues James, [[ignores the
constructed nature of]{.mark} the [debility produced through
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[reifies]{.underline}]{.mark} the notion [that [the body
must]{.mark}]{.underline} always [[be restored from
debility]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drawing on the work of Henri-Jacques
Stiker,60 James writes: This cosmetic fix allows the inequalities
created by political, social and ideological practices that relegate
certain bodies to economic, gender, sex and physical (racial) alterity
to conveniently recede from view ... through 'naturalizing' socially
produced disability, naming all difference 'disability' and claiming all
'disabled' capable of 'rehabilitation,' preventative measures are judged
unnecessary.61 James' argument [[recognises not only the
socially]{.mark} [constructed nature of disability]{.mark} resultant
from armed conflict,]{.underline} [[but also]{.underline}]{.mark} the
social construction of 'the poor to the unemployed' [as
[Other]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[in need of rehabilitative
interventions by the state]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than recognition
of any need to transform structural inequalities. However, James'
approach also highlights the 'socially constructed' nature of disability
which, I argue, might have two meanings.62 First, as James writes,
drawing on Stiker, a host of differences become marked as 'disabled' in
a manner that requires individual interventions over structural change.
Second, [thinking through the disabled body returning from combat, the
body is twice constructed as damaged]{.underline}, initially through the
risk contained in a political decision to send armed forces to combat
situations which is, in essence, [a constructed risk and then through
the need to 'restore' the body of the soldier]{.underline}, rather than
care or accept differences associated with disability[. [For individuals
who are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[framed as
disabled]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether as the consequence of political
decisions, political apathy, or from chronic, genetic, or other medical
conditions, [[the focus remains]{.mark} on the rehabilitation [to become
ablebodied rather than a recognition that all bodies carry
debilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, risk debility, and are debilitated.
Likewise, there is a failure to see how compulsory ablebodiedness is
attributed to the imagined subject of law. The shift to honouring,
accepting, [and [seeing debility as integral to
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[frames subjectivity
differently]{.mark} [and, potentially, accepts the interface of
technology with any body as an aspect of subjectivity]{.mark} just as
the entwined relationships with humanness and matter,]{.underline}
environment and nonhuman animals have the potential to radically alter
legal constructions and engagements with subjectivity. James goes on to
remind us that the dismembered female form has a long history in Western
iconography from the Venus de Milo to the cropped female body of
contemporary Hollywood films: [if women are reduced to 'parts', black
women are split even further as they are asked to pry the signs of
blackness from their bodies and as blackness is ripped from their bodies
and reshaped into a myriad of cultural signifiers]{.underline}.63 [[The
maimed body of war must]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[be restored in
a way that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[female and black bodies can never
be]{.underline}]{.mark} restored/[[completed, reinscribing white
masculine histories]{.underline}]{.mark} into the project of assistive
military technologies for returned soldiers. For Yasmin Gunaratnam,
'\[r\]ace and gender, in other words, complicate the cultural presence
of disability'. 64 Thinking forward, through these re-readings of the
material and discursive effects of subject formation, borne through the
experience of citizenship and its various dislocations, and invisibly
carried through legal categorisation, demands new modes of understanding
and representing subjectivity. [[An]{.mark} [alternative framing
of]{.mark} [subjectivity might]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[begin
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[notion of debility and the
body]{.underline}, [acknowledging]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [the
[interrelated othering of racial and gendered others in the construction
of legal subjectivity endured by modern man.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Debility]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[frames]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[future [interface with technology as not rehabilitative]{.mark}, or
restorative, [but rather akin to the already-interface between
technology and humans:]{.mark}]{.underline} a process that has a history
as old as human invention. The technology of fire, for example,
fundamentally altered human existence, changed her needs, patterns, and
consumptions. Moreover, the contemporary use of technology has starkly
changed the understanding of humanness, how humans live, interact,
survive. At the same time both technology and humans impact on the
livelihoods of nonhuman animals and of earth. To shift toward the notion
of intertwined existence -- or subjectivities -- the exoskeleton has
inspired me to see the human body as body-never-whole-never-complete and
as ordinary in its dependencies on others, including nonhuman animals,
matter, and technologies. Thus, drawing on Donna Reeves, it is necessary
to recognise: For people with impairments, the hybridisation of
machine/human or animal/human is often synonymous with lived experience,
particularly for those with physical or sensory impairments ...
Potential cyborg figures can be seen in the wheelchair user, the person
with a cochlear implant, artificial leg or pacemaker, someone who uses
an assistance dog.65 While Reeve acknowledges the differential cultural
readings of different technologies, their gendered meanings, the
economic privileges required for access, the dependencies, and the
increased means of medical surveillance technologies invoked must also
be heeded. Reeve argues, ['\[r\]ather than seeing technology as "fixing"
impaired people]{.underline} [in normative ways]{.underline} (and
therefore to be rejected), it is more productive to see the new ways of
being in the world that emerge from living as cyborg'. 66 Thus, to see
the debilitated body67 as motif for reimagining subjectivity requires
recognition of the ways the conceptualisation of modernist man has
always rendered the non-male, non-heterosexual/heteronormative body as
not only othered but debilitated. Feminist theorising on subjectivity
and feminist legal projects might thus take the othered body as the
conceptual lens to engage the nonhuman, matter, and technology. Viva la
Frida!

#### The impact is techno caste system ordering those who have modified their bodies and those who have not

**Fahn 20** (Chia Wei Fahn is an Assistant Professor in the Masters of
Occupational Therapy Program, Perfecting Bodies: Who Are the Disabled in
Andrew Niccol's Gattaca?, <https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/5/2/6>,
4/1/20)

**[[The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers and
social exclusion as the main contributing factors in disabling
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[18,34,35\]. [Gattaca depicts a new
social model of disability, displacing the role of current physical
norms in a "cascading series of replacements reminiscent of Derrida's
ideas of deferral or deferring---one replacement replacing another"
\[9\] (p. 78]{.underline}). A social model of disability is employed
here to show disability as a socially constructed identity. [Niccol
brings to public attention a provocative discourse on the issues that
arise with the blind acceptance of genetic determinism and disabling the
able-bodied. The disabled are genetically stigmatized, offspring of
"those parents who, for moral or, more likely economic reasons, refrain
from tampering with their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail to
abort a deprived fetus" that "condemn their children to a life of
routine discrimination" \[23\] (p. 12).]{.underline} What began as a
means to rid society of inheritable diseases has become a way to "design
your offspring---the line between health and enhancement blurred
forever" \[23\] (p. 36). The possibility of genetic manipulation extends
the scope of ableism, and things we now accept as "normal", such as
myopia, obesity, and addiction, all present opportunities to perfect the
species. [Thinking back to the day of his birth, Vincent nostalgically
remarks that "not so long ago, I would have been considered a perfectly
normal, healthy baby. Ten fingers, ten toes. That was all that used to
matter" \[23\] (p. 13).]{.underline} In a world where genetic screening
is prerequisite to procreating, however, he is categorized as
"\[o\]ficially \[as\] 'In-Valids,' also known as 'godchildren' . . .
'deficients', 'defectives', 'geno-junk' . . . 'the fucked-up people'"
\[23\] (p. 13). **[[Average physical and intellectual normality is no
longer the social ideal with the widespread administration of genomic
treatments, causing normal and able bodies by today's definition to
gradually become part of the disabled and disenfranchised.]{.mark}
[Genetic editing extends the boundaries of ableist ideology to view all
unaltered bodies as disabled,]{.mark} [potentially opening an oppressive
social caste that is more exclusive than the present disability
dichotomy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Johnson Cheu's essay, "De-gene-erates,
Replicants and Other Aliens: (Re)defining Disability in Futuristic
Film", addresses future shifts in the social model of disability,
arguing **["[if disability, as a social construction, exists on more
than a theoretical plane, disability should be present as a social
stigma in the future . . . which occupy a social stigma of being unfit,
sub-human, inferior, that shows the very existence of disability as a
social construction"]{.mark} \[]{.underline}**36\] (p. 202). Disability
in Gattaca remains a fixed category which humanity cannot transcend, "an
atavism representing the remainder of normal at the end of normal" \[9\]
(p. 14). Regarding genomics' impact on the social political as well as
economic class structures, Gattaca subverts the belief that genetic
engineering betters lives for those who live with disabilities with an
emphasis on the dissonance between promised potential and social
reality. Unscreened births are categorized as "the 'healthy ill'. They
don't actually have anything yet---they may never. But since few of the
pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as
if they were already sick" \[23\] (p. 37). [Genetic editing led to an
amplified expression of ableism in human society, by decreeing those we
deem normal by today's standards the healthy disabled, "an unfinished
and inherently malfunctioning organism" \[8\] (p. 260).]{.underline}
Niccol predicts a future when our entire population is presumed to be in
need of a cure. **[An ["error free" biological profile becomes the sole
determinant of ableism, an eradication of the "norm" we are accustomed
to leads to further polarization of social and economic
classes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Vincent's self-perception is severely
influenced by those surrounding him, a continuous undermining of his
efforts in life while "from an early age I came to think of myself as
others thought of me---chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny
nose treated as if it were life-threatening" \[23\] (p. 13). Niccol
articulates genetic technology's impact on society, examining how
fundamentals in labor, class, and disability are redefined through the
rise of genomics to form "a relation of power and substitution
continuing from the social to the genetic" \[9\] (p. 81[). For better or
worse, genetic manipulation pushes the boundaries of what is previously
considered as the human norm; all bodies are seen as "limited, defective
and in need of constant improvement beyond species-typical boundaries"
\[37\] (p. 254).]{.underline}

#### The alt is a centering of disabled perspectives through crip technoscience

Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University, Kelly Fritsch
works in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Carleton
University, , Crip Technoscience Manifesto,
https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29607,
4/1/19)

[**[Disabled people are experts and designers of everyday life. But we
also harness technoscience for political action]{.underline}**,
**[refusing to comply with demands to cure, fix, or eliminate
disability.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Attentive to the intersectional
workings of power and privilege, we agitate against independence and
productivity as requirements for existence.]{.underline}** **[Building
upon earlier work defining crip technoscience as politicized design
activism]{.underline}** (Hamraie, 2015, 2017), we articulate four
political commitments of crip technoscience as a field of critical
scholarship, practice, and activism.2In framing crip technoscience as
such, we follow feminist technoscience studies by describing both a
realm of practice and a field of knowing that has emerged from it.
**[[Crip technoscience braids together two provocative concepts: "crip,"
the non-compliant, anti-assimilationist position that disability is a
desirable part of the world, and "technoscience," the co-production of
science, technology, and political life]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Jasanoff, 2004; Murphy, 2012[). **[Crip theory centers disability as a
locus of resistance against "compulsory
ablebodiedness"]{.underline}**]{.mark} (McRuer, 2006)**[[and
"ablenationalism"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Mitchell & Snyder, 2015),
**[[agitating against liberal assimilation and inclusion practices
bymarkingdisability as a desirably generativeand creativerelational
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Fritsch, 2015a).We seek to bring crip
theory and feminist technoscience into closer contact, exploring their
generative frictions**[[. In some respects, the field
of]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[disability studies has been entangled with science and technology
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (STS)---and feminist STS in
particular---[**[since its origins, especially through its critiques of
biomedicine and militarism and in its embrace of situated
epistemologies.In naming crip technoscience, we invoke long histories of
feminist, queer, anti-racist, and disability collaborative
praxi]{.mark}**s, such as in technoscience projects engaging Universal
Design, sensory engineering, reproductive justice, and HIV/AIDS
activism]{.underline}.2However, to date, criptheorists have had limited
engagement with the criticalconcept of technoscience, particularly as it
is used in feminist STS to mean the productive and non-innocent
entanglement of scientific knowing and technological making.3This
limited engagement has yielded an ahistorical position that science,
technology, and medicine are anathema to crip world-remaking, ignoring
disabled peoples' ongoing, creative, and open-ended appropriations of
science, technology,and medicine,particularlyinacts of protest and
"epistemic activism" (Hamraie, 2012, 2017, p. 132). **[[Crip
technoscience thus calls forth]{.mark} Leah Lakshmi
Piepzna-Samarasinha's concept of ["crip science"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(2018, p. 69)**[t[o highlight the skills, wisdom, resources, and hacks
disabled people utilize for navigating and altering inaccessible
worlds]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[In pushing crip
technoscience as a field of research and a practice of critical
"knowing-making"]{.mark} (Hamraie,2017, p. 99[), we conjure frictional
practices of access production, acknowledging that science and
technology can be used to both produce and dismantle
injustice]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a field of study, crip
technoscience begins from the feminist politics of technoscientific
"non-innocence"(Haraway, 1991), acknowledging that many of the
technologies that have enabled disabled people to gain access to the
social world have been produced through military-industrial research and
development, imperial and colonial relations, and ecological
destruction, all of which contribute to the uneven debilitation of human
and non-human life (Erevelles, 2011; Fritsch, 2015b; Kafer, 2013; Puar,
2017). Nevertheless, we contend that technoscience can be a
transformative tool for disability justice.We contrast crip
technosciencewith mainstream "disability technoscience" as a field of
traditional expertrelations andpractices concerned with
designingfordisabledpeople rather than withor bydisabled people. In
mainstream disability technoscience, such fixes are understood as de
facto goods, services for (supposedly) unfortunate disabled people, and
ultimately depoliticized. Disability technoscience positions enhancement
and capacitation as progressive moves to overcome disability.
"Hackathons" led by charity organizations embody
innovation-for-innovation's sake and definedisability as a problemin
search of a solution (Wong, 2015a,2015b). Disabled people are often
treated purely as clients or users. For example, the organization Tikkun
Olam Makers (TOM) describes disabled people as "need knowers" and
non-disabled designers and engineers as "solution experts." Riffing on
the term special needs, which associates disabled people with minority
interests outside of majority norms, these designations reinforce the
division between disabled people as passive recipients of access or
assistive technologies and non-disabled designers, developers, and
technologists as experts. **[[Disability technoscience reinforces the
sense that disabled people are not already making, hacking, and
tinkering with existing material arrangements. Disability is cast as an
object of innovation discourse, rather than as a driver of technological
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Melanie Yergeau (2014) historicizes
mainstream disability "hacktivism," arguing that hackathons have become
the "new telethon" in that they frame "disability as pitiable and in
need of remediation."4In response, Yergeau invokes "criptastic
hacking"as a "disability-led movement, rather than a series of apps and
patches and fixes designed by non-disabled people who cannot even be
bothered to talk with disabled people." Criptastic hacking highlights
crip technoscience asa field of relations, knowledges, and practices
that enables the flourishing of crip ways of producing and engaging the
material world

The latest set of technological solutions to the perceived problems of
disabled people is Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. But
like other technologies discussed in this essay, [[Artificial
Intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} research and AIs currently [[under
development contain]{.underline}]{.mark} several [[inscriptions of
technoableism]{.underline}]{.mark} that I want to warn against. **[[I
also want to gesture to an emerging frame for considering appropriate
disability technology, called Crip Technoscience]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\[16\]. The [[current mood is one of optimism about machine learning and
Artificial Intelligence for disability
applications]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Headlines scream about it: "How AI
Could Transform the Lives of Disabled People" \[10\], "How Artificial
Intelligence Can Help With Disabilities" \[19\], and "Artificial
Intelligence Poised to Improve Lives of People with
Disabilities"]{.underline} \[46\]. Sometimes these [headlines
acknowledge]{.underline} AI's potential for helping people as they age
(correctly assuming that older folks are more likely to have
disabilities), [[hyping]{.underline} [the potential for robot
caregivers]{.underline}]{.mark} and AI emotional support "animals" ---
[[AI that can take the place of human carers or
friends]{.underline},]{.mark} often at a lower financial cost:
"Artificial Intelligence Could Improve How We Age" \[29\], "Can China
Win the Artificial Intelligence Race by Serving the Elderly?" \[18\],
and "Robot Caregivers are Saving the Elderly from Lives of Loneliness"
\[43\]. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} breathless [[headlines
make]{.mark}]{.underline} clear the assumptions that ground the articles
that follow them --- [[assumptions about what it is to be
disabled]{.underline}]{.mark} and what it is to age. (These articles
tend to lump disability and aging together, and I therefore examine the
two together, but there are important differences between these
demographic groups in terms of stigma, access, convenience, societal
narrative, and consideration.) Like earlier technological interventions
on disabled lives, these technologies rely on assumptions about the
disabled and aging individual rather than the environment. For example,
ideas about the importance of independence factor heavily into coverage
of AI for disabled and older folks, and are particularly clear in
discussions around autonomous vehicles, companion robots (like Paro),
home-based applications (like Alexa), and caretaking robots. [[All of
these technologies emphasize aging and disability as problems for
individual consumers, rather than problems for
society]{.underline}.]{.mark}12 Why should the lack of accessible
transport for people who cannot drive be a problem for the non-driver
rather than for society? Why should the loneliness and isolation
experienced by people who cannot easily leave their homes be solved by
in-home robots rather than by better planning and infrastructure within
our communities? [[AI designers]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark}
clearly [[focused on changing the individual to fit the environment
rather than the other way around]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example,
[many]{.underline} of the ["[conveniences" offered by AI applications
are mostly conveniences for the benefit of the user's family, rather
than the users themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} These [[technologies are
framed as unburdening families]{.underline}]{.mark} from worry by
enabling them to remotely monitor or check in on their loved one's
condition; as reducing the financial costs of hiring human caretakers;
and as combating the user's isolation and loneliness, thus requiring
fewer visits from family members. [When AI technology is framed as
helping the family, [it positions disabled]{.mark} and old [people as
recipients of care rather than as agents in their own
lives,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and it decenters them and their
experiences]{.underline}]{.mark}, instead moving the nondisabled family
members into the center of the story ([which also fails to recognize
that disabled people can have disabled family members and can be
caregivers themselves]{.underline}).

This same centering of ability is produced by the narratives' focus on
independence as the main goal of disability design. Indeed, the nearly
obsessive focus on independence is another "tell" for ableism. As
Elliott Kukla writes: We are born needing care and die needing care, and
I am no exception. At brief moments in the middle of life, we hold the
illusion of independence, but we are always driving on roads we did not
build, eating foods we did not pick or raise. Allowing the illusion of
my own independence to drop away unmasked a fundamental truth of being
human \[24[\]. **[This sentiment echoes throughout current disability
studies: we are all interdependent, and independence has always already
been an illusion]{.underline}**.]{.mark}13 [[But
disable]{.mark}d]{.underline} and old [[people have often needed to
advocate for independence, because they have historically been the
subject of laws,]{.mark} de facto rules, and public norms [that deny
them]{.mark} full citizenship, [access]{.mark}, and opportunity [to
participate in public life]{.mark}. [For example,]{.mark} early
disability activism of the 1970s and 1980s [produced a movement called
the independent living movement]{.mark}]{.underline}. The name ---
independent living --- indicates [[a reaction to the historical framing
of disabled people as completely dependent]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
objects to be moved around by nondisabled people. [[Despite the name,
this movement was not about independence in the sense of
isolatio]{.mark}n]{.underline}, total responsibility for one's own
needs, and total avoidance of inconvenience to nondisabled people [---
**[the values that underpin current narratives about AI. Instead, the
movement was about the right to a public life, a life outside of
institution]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[s]{.underline}** --- an
interdependent life. It demanded community living (the slogan "Our
Homes, Not Nursing Homes!"), access to education and to public spaces
(schools, grocery stores, shops, etc.), vocational services (to enable
people to work), and assistive technologies (to help people move and
remain outside of institutionalized and segregated care). The
independent living movement demanded only that disabled people have the
same autonomy, rights, and freedoms that nondisabled people enjoy**[.
[Interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (neither isolationist
independence nor dependence[) **[is a central value in the Crip
Technoscience Manifesto]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** It is
the second item on the list: "Crip technoscience is committed to
interdependence as a political technology" \[17, p. 12\], and the
Manifesto itself, which is "premised on interdependence," was written to
describe the "core values" of crip technoscience. According to Hamraie
and Fritsch \[16, 17\], **[[crip technoscience blends critical
disability studies with]{.mark} approaches from [the field of Science
and Technology Studies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (STS). **[[It anticipates
a world in which disabled people are seen as experts about their
experiences]{.mark} and the materiality and context of their
bodies.]{.underline}** **[[Crip technoscience anticipates accessible
futures that work not toward cure or normalization but toward
freedom]{.mark}. [AI as a disability technology also presents particular
problems of data privacy, especially given the]{.mark} long and ongoing
[history of the policing of disabled bodies]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[[For example, the recently deployed Electronic Visit
Verification]{.mark} (EVV) [technologies]{.mark} enable personal care
attendants (PCAs) to clock in and out of their home health visits.
[Under EVV, these personal care attendants, who provide physical support
for disabled people to accomplish daily tasks]{.mark}]{.underline}
(toileting, prepping food, getting in a wheelchair), [[are issued mobile
phones to track their time on the job. But disability activists express
worry about the scope of the monitoring enabled by this
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}. As disability activist and filmmaker
Dominick Evans tweeted: It is a pure violation of the civil liberties
and personal freedom of disabled people across the United States. Our
PCAs are now being equipped with something equivalent to an ankle
bracelet by the US government! They are giving \[sic\] phones that have
cameras in the front and the back so they can track exactly what all of
us who need homecare are doing. They could record any conversation.
These devices have to stay in our homes, at all times. We'll never know
when they are recording, and we don't know who has access to them beyond
the monitoring company, and government agencies. It's a huge threat to
the personal safety of disabled people who require home care \[12\] The
use of EVV technology is a huge invasion of privacy --- an invasion that
would not be permitted for many segments of society.14 **[Can you
imagine if any nondisabled, noncriminal citizen was required by the
government to allow a device with the potential to monitor them in their
homes at all times?]{.underline}** **[[This is precisely what some of
the proposed AI technologies will do. And disabled people]{.mark} ---
especially disabled people who are multiply minoritized, whose
identities are more carefully scrutinized by others --- [are rightfully
concerned]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our society does not value the privacy
of older people and disabled people,15 and many of the AIs in
development sacrifice this privacy in favor of the peace of mind of
presumably nondisabled caretakers --- an assumption that disabled and
old people are not agents in their own right.

Experiences of Real Disabled People

**[[The crux of the problem is that AI designs, like other technologies
meant to address disability issues, are often spearheaded by people not
deeply embedded in the disability community]{.mark}
---]{.underline}**people who simply imagine what it might be like to be

worlds more conducive to our existence.

**Ellcessor 16** (Elizabeth Ellcessor is an associate professor of media
studies at the University of Virginia, "Cyborg hoaxes: Disability,
deception, and critical studies of digital media",

In the many formulations of digital media, Internet, or new media
studies, "critical cyberculture studies" is notable for its attempt to
put "cultural difference---human elements of race and ethnicity, gender,
sexuality, age, and disability ... front and center, informing our
research questions, frameworks, and findings" (Silver, 2006: 8[).
**Despite such rhetoric, [disability was marginalized by cyberculture
studies and other strands of Internet studies in their first decade,
either through its use as metaphor or through its
invisibility]{.mark}.** In much of these literatures, disability has
been a concretizing metaphor, used to illustrate abstract theories and
not interrogated for its own political baggage and relation to lived
experiences and identities.]{.underline} This recalls what literary and
disability scholars David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder (2001) have argued
about the use of disability in fiction, where it serves as a "narrative
prosthesis," a motivating malady that drives further storytelling. In
both cases, disability is abstracted and used to advance other ideas.
[**[The clearest example of such metaphorical use of disability lies in
cyborg theory]{.mark}, where it appeared "only as example, not as
critical category"**]{.underline} (Kafer, 2013: 105). As described in
Donna Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto," the cyborg represented the
increasingly blurred boundaries between human and animal, human and
machine, in postmodernity. [Haraway (1991) invoked disability to
describe the pleasures of blending the human and the other, suggesting
that "perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and
sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization
with other communication devices,"]{.underline} and that "machines can
be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves" (p. 154).
[Similarly, Constance Penley and Andrew Ross (1991) opened their
anthology by suggesting that "the highly developed technoculture of the
handicapped"]{.underline} would be important for the development of
cyborg theory (p. xvi); this possibility was, however, unrealized in
their anthology. [[**Incorporation of actual experiences with
prosthetics could have offered depth to these speculative cyborg
futures, but it could also have troubled them,** **as lived experiences
of disability and assistive technology are often frustrating, painful,
or stigmatizing**]{.mark} **rather than politically
liberating.**]{.underline} **[[In the few cases in which scholars
considered experiences of disability in concert with cyborg theory,
their findings were mixed. For instance, d/Deaf individuals who received
cochlear implants did not experience this as an empowering cyborg
identity but as a troubling of their community identity and sense of
self]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Cherney, 1999). The invisibility of
disability in Internet studies is evident when we turn a critical eye to
the case of Joan. Although numerous scholars took up this case in
relation to gender, sexuality, postmodern identity, and online
disembodiment, analysis through the lens of disability was sorely
lacking. **[Turkle focused on the boundaries between identity play as a
healthy form of experimentation and identity deception as
betrayal.]{.underline}** Howard Rheingold invoked this story as part of
a larger discussion of online communities' experiences of trust and
deception. O'Brien used the story to argue the importance of gender in
organizing interpersonal interactions online and offline. For Mark
Poster, as well, the case was one of gender deception, demonstrating how
gender could be reinscribed online. In Roseanne Allucquère Stone's
chapter, "The Cross-Dressing Psychiatrist," [she presented this story as
an illustration of the flexibility of postmodern identity, an argument
that both renders disability invisible as a lived phenomenon and treats
it metaphorically.]{.underline} Such appearances---but analytic
irrelevance---of disability in Internet studies led Gerard Goggin and
Christopher Newell (2003) to suggest that Internet studies and related
fields retained a conceptualization of disability as deficiency that
obscured its function as identity and experience (p. 115). In their
analysis of Joan, and related literature in cyberculture studies, Goggin
and Newell provided a rare illustration of what disability studies could
offer to scholars of Internet and new media culture. [They wrote that
Stone, in particular, "fails to identify the way in which \[a medical
discourse of disability\] fundamentally shapes her own analysis and
taken-for-granted views of ... the disabled body"]{.underline} (Goggin
and Newell, 2003: 113). While scholars readily explored the diverse
personas adopted by online users in various contexts, Goggin and Newell
(2003) noted reliance on a "fixed, reified identity position" (p. 114)
regarding disability, an assumption that disability could only be
performed in a limited fashion. [**[The postmodern fluidity of
cyberculture studies did not extend to disability, and the lived
experiences of disability online were rarely analyzed,]{.mark} with
metaphorical uses and uninterrogated anecdotes serving as the basis for
theory.** Goggin and Newell's Digital Disability offered serious study
of uses of the Internet by people with disabilities, the limitations of
technology regarding disability access, and the formation of disability
cultures online. It laid the groundwork for future studies of disability
online, many of which have addressed both online cultures and the
offline structures of power that shape technologies]{.underline} (Adam
and Kreps, 2009; Ellcessor, 2016; Ellis and Kent, 2010; Goggin and
Noonan, 2006; Jaeger, 2011; Moser, 2006[). **Although this literature
has grown, its insights regarding the interplay of bodies, technologies,
and cultural hierarchies of identity have not been widely incorporated
into studies of online culture more broadly.**]{.underline}

#### The aff is an impossible move to deploy biotech to fix disability that inevitably entrenches ableism

**Ellcessor 16** (Elizabeth Ellcessor is an associate professor of media
studies at the University of Virginia, "Cyborg hoaxes: Disability,
deception, and critical studies of digital media",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444816642754>, 4/19/16,
Buck)

[Despite the common analysis of online media as opportunities for
self-exploration or identity experimentation, cyborg hoaxes present
disability as a fixed element of identity that may, in turn, be "fixed"
by technology that extends an individual beyond their (limited)
capacities.]{.underline} [In the first place, cyborg hoaxes reproduce
stereotypical representations of disability as a fixed element of
identity with predictable restrictions. Second**, [any promise of
technology "fixing" disability implies that disability ought to be fixed
and reflects an ableist ideology]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Disability is
presented as a fixed, static, identity marker in cyborg
hoaxes.]{.underline} The very use of disability as an excuse, as
described above, is indicative of an assumption that disability produces
predictable symptoms. **[[The presentation of disability as a static
identity marker, with unchanging consequences, reflects assumptions of a
dualist and ableist culture,]{.mark} [in which ability is contrasted
with disability and gradations are largely
invisible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Cyborg hoaxes cling tightly to a
narrow narrative of disability and limitation, while (as will be
discussed later) people with disabilities online exhibit a range of
changeable relationships to society, technology, and sexuality.
[[**Insofar as technology offers to "fix" disability, it does so through
invisibility, enabling people with disabilities to take on non-disabled
representations of self**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet, as media scholars
Katie Ellis and Mike Kent (2010) caution[**, "[if people with disability
in this sense become invisible in virtual worlds, this could have
implications for the visibility of people with disability in broader
society]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (p. 123). There are strong tendencies to
assume the whiteness and maleness of online participants in the absence
of complex representations of alternative identities (Nakamura, 2002).
An able-bodied perspective is similarly dominant and reinforced by the
invisibility of disability online. [Kafer]{.underline} (2013) [argues
that **[culture often imagines technologically enabled futures as spaces
without disability, meaning that "the value of a future that includes
disabled people goes unrecognized, while the value of a disability-free
future is seen as self-evident"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 3).
**[[Technology may also "fix" disability by offering access to a social
life that is portrayed as otherwise impossible due to
disability.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Rheingold (1994), for example, wrote
that "Joan's mentor had given her a computer, modem, and a subscription
to CompuServe, where Joan instantly blossomed" (p. 165). [[**This
statement privileges technology as a means to overcome stigma or
isolation, but it relies upon an ignorance of how technologies can
reinforce oppression through features that cannot be used by people with
disabilities**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In 2009, Spread the Word gained traction in the public school system of
Colchester, Connecticut, my hometown, as well as in schools across the
country. The campaign spread awareness about the derogatory and negative
connotations that the "R-word" holds towards people with cognitive
disabilities, and it encouraged people to sign a pledge to stop using
it. By 2020, the global campaign gained over 800,000 online pledges,
according to its [website](https://www.spreadtheword.global/). **[The
impact of the campaign is undeniable, but [what about all of the other
ableist slurs that remain embedded within our everyday language and
culture? Over the past decade, the use of the "R-word" decreased,
however ableist slurs such as
"crippling]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,"]{.mark} "handicap,"
"differently-abled" and "wheelchair-bound[" **[remain normalized in our
language with complete disregard for the negative connotations they hold
toward disabled people]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, and this needs to be
addressed by society. As a member of the disabled community, I've always
felt uncomfortable seeing these slurs used in
conversations]{.underline}**, written in books and being thrown around
as playful insults between my peers, but because they were so widely
used, it was difficult for me to pinpoint why it made me uncomfortable.
**[[Unfortunately, this normalization remains because of the lack of
awareness surrounding the trauma disabled people face in relation to
these slurs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I first became aware of the slur
"cripple" in elementary school while watching the 2009 movie adaptation
of A Christmas Carol. The original book, published in 1843 by Charles
Dickens, refers to Bob Cratchit's son, nicknamed "Tiny Tim," as a
cripple. During the 19th century, slurs with a variation of the word
"cripple" were even more normalized than they are today. However, in the
modern age of movie adaptations, the characters still refer to him as a
cripple, even though it is an outdated term. Whenever I watched the
movie, I got the sense that calling the character a cripple portrayed
him as inferior, stemming from an able-centric place of pity, a
reflection of how all abled people view disabled people. Consequently, I
felt as though I was also viewed this way by those around me. When I
hear the word "handicap" used in conversations, it's usually in
reference to the reserved parking spots or to refer to a specific
disability. Most people, however, don't understand the negative
implication surrounding this word. On Feb. 5, 2020, former Vice
President Joe Biden reflected on his struggle with a stutter throughout
his childhood at the CNN Presidential town hall. "You know, stuttering,
when you think about it, is the only handicap that people still laugh
about," Biden said. Putting aside the inaccuracy of his statement, he
should have avoided the term "handicap" because "disabled" is the
preferred and politically correct term. **[[When I hear people using
ableist slurs, they're usually not in a hateful context. With the word
"crippling," I normally hear it used in conversations to describe mental
illnesses,]{.mark} such as anxiety or depression, as a way of
emphasizing the intensity of their illness.]{.underline}** However,
people can describe their mental illnesses without offending other
communities. For example, instead of saying "crippling anxiety," they
can say "overwhelming anxiety." Similarly, ableist slurs can simply be
replaced by more politically correct terms. "Accessible" should replace
"handicap," "disabled" should replace "differently-abled" and
"wheelchair-user" should replace "wheelchair-bound." **[[Even if the use
of ableist slurs isn't always used as an attack on disabled people, the
lack of awareness about them further permits their normalization in our
culture and language.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Consequently, they act as a
microaggression that ultimately adds to the ableism faced by an already
marginalized community. Today, society is making strides in omitting the
slurs and outdated terms that have a history of offending marginalized
communities. The disabled community deserves that same respect.

#### Disability metaphors are used to naturalize nations positions as inferior to the United States

**McRuer 10** (Robert McRuer is an American theorist who has contributed
to fields in transnational queer and disability studies, "Reflections on
Disability in Haiti", <https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398278/summary>,
January 2010, Barneys)

**[[Illness and contagion are only part of the story of]{.mark} Haiti\'s
[metaphorization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however. Even the quickest
survey of global headlines following the disaster reveals (with
predictable frequency) reports that the earthquake had \'crippled\' the
nation, the city, the infrastructure, the agricultural or tourist
industries, or humanitarian efforts. **[[Hospital and emergency
responses had been, in these reports, \'paralyzed\' and the government,
according to no less than former U.S. president Bill
Clinton]{.underline}]{.mark}** (tapped by President Barack Obama to
assist in the crisis), **[[had been, \"first of all, disabled.\" \"When
this emergency passes]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** Clinton insisted, \"then
we know Haiti is going to have to get back on its feet again. And we
want to be a part of that\" (qtd. in Fabian).

These readily available metaphors of both disability and able-bodiedness
(Clinton\'s comments obviously invoking a Haiti-to-come that is
nondisabled, healthy, robust, standing on two feet) are in part simply
journalistic stock-in-trade
following [disasters](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&hitCount=1&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CA243524912&docType=Essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=ZONE-MOD1&prodId=AONE&pageNum=1&contentSet=GALE%7CA243524912&searchId=R1&userGroupName=umuser&inPS=true) but
are, I am arguing, also particularly entrenched in relation to Haiti.
Long before the 2010 earthquake, **[[Haiti\'s position in the global

\"two hundred years of crippling debt,\" the already \"feeble\" economy
has been \"knocked flat\" by repeated disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Flaherty; Dougherty and Shwiff). **[[This terminology has had the dual

[[Policy-makers,]{.mark} the media, and many academics treat
[quantitative material as if it is fundamentally different and superior
to qualitative data]{.mark}. **[Numbers are assumed to report 'the
facts'; they are seen as authoritative, neutral, dispassionate, and
objective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [governments do not use
numbers merely to describe the world, they increasingly use statistics
as an essential part of the technology by which they seek to re/shape
educational systems. In this way, **[numbers play a key role in how
inequality is shaped, legitimized, and
protected]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This has been called
'[policy as numbers']{.mark}]{.underline} (Rose 1999; Ozga and Lingard
2007; Rizvi and Lingard 2010): [neo-liberalism has enhanced the
significance of numbers and statistics as technologies of governance, as
central to what Power (1997) calls the rise of the 'audit society' and
what Neave (1998) has called 'the evaluative state']{.underline}.
(Lingard 2011, 359)[1 Numbers are increasingly used to justify policy
priorities and to label teachers, schools, districts, and even entire
countries, as educational successes and failures]{.underline}. National
testing programs, such as the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) reforms in the
US and the use of school performance tables in England, have popularized
the idea that numbers can be used to expose (and change) failing schools
(Gillborn and Youdell 2000; Darling-Hammond 2007; Barber 2012). For
example, across the globe politicians and pressure-groups frequently try
to make their case by quoting results from PISA (Program of
International Student Assessment) -- which is run by the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Prominent examples
exist in the States, the UK and Australia (see Lingard, Creagh, and Vass
2012). Countries' positions in the PISA tables are often cited as if
they unambiguously and accurately represent the relative quality of
schooling in different nations (despite their very different populations
and education systems). And yet the commentaries rarely include any
detail about the relatively small samples (less than 200 schools in all
but one of the US returns since 2000)(NCES n.d.); the selective
curricular coverage of the tests (in reading, math, and science); nor
the fact that students in different countries sometimes take different
assessments or miss certain assessments altogether (Stewart 2013).
Despite these severe limitations, the UK government frequently cites
PISA results as evidence of the need for change (cf. Department for
Education (DfE) 2015, 8) and has stated that it will 'measure the
increased performance of the school system as a whole by reference to
international tables of student attainment, such as PISA' (quoted in
Scott 2016). Compare the confident use of PISA (below), by the
then-Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, and the more
circumspect view offered by an academic critic: Since the 1990s our
performance in these league tables has been at best, stagnant, at worst
declining. In the latest results we are 21st amongst 65 participants in
the world for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for mathematics. For
all the well-intentioned efforts of past governments we are still
falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world.
(Gove 2013) '[There are very few things you can summarise with a number
and yet Pisa claims to be able to capture a country's entire education
system in just three of them. It can't be possible.']{.underline} Dr
Hugh Morrison, Queen's University Belfast (quoted in Stewart 2013).

[Numbers and accountability On both sides of the Atlantic,
[policy-makers]{.mark} have [argued]{.mark} that [statistics]{.mark}
will allow [greater 'accountability']{.mark} in education. **[But the
thinking behind such claims is flawed in numerous
ways]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As Linda Darling-Hammond (2007) has noted,
for example, under NCLB the numerous wider structural inequities that
shape educational outcomes are ignored by focusing attention at the
school level: ... [the wealthiest US public schools spend at least 10
times more than the poorest schools ... Although the Act orders schools
to ensure that 100% of students test at levels identified as
'proficient' ... the small per-pupil dollar allocation the law makes to
schools serving low-income students is well under 10% of schools' total
spending, far too little to correct these conditions]{.underline}
(247--8) [Additionally, the use of quantitative measures as a form of
accountability assumes that the measures are valid, that is, that the
recorded data bear some relevance to the issue/s that lie behind the
targets]{.underline}. But there is often scope for cheating and some
high-profile cases have emerged. In England, for example, documented
cases include teachers altering students' work and a school that removed
low-attaining students from its official roll in advance of high-stakes
testing, thereby artificially raising the proportion of students deemed
'successful' (Harding 2015). In the US, David Hursh notes that gaming
the system can produce considerable rewards: Rodney Paige, as
superintendent of the Houston Independent School District (and later
chosen to be President \[GW\] Bush's first Secretary of Education) ...
\[ordered\] principals to not list a student as dropping out but as
having left for another school or some reason other than dropping out.
Such creative book-keeping resulted in the district claiming a greatly
reduced dropout rate of 1.5% in 2001--02 and winning a national award
for excellence (Hursh 2007, 302) Numbers and equity In the UK,
government policy puts numbers at the heart of its proclaimed strategy
to create a fairer society. The Conservative Party, which formed the
dominant partner in the Coalition Government (2010--2015), went into the
2010 general election with arguments about 'transparency' threaded
throughout their Party Manifesto. This included the promise, emphasized
as a bold subheading, to 'Publish data so the public can hold government
to account' (Conservative Conservative Party 2010, 69). Subsequently,
the rhetoric was translated into a policy that envisaged 'the public'
using statistics to understand, challenge and then change the behavior
of public authorities, including the Government itself: 'Our proposals,'
the Government Equalities Office (GEO) has said, 'use the power of
transparency to help public bodies to fulfil the aims of the Equality
Duty to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and
foster good relations between different groups. This means that public
bodies will be judged by citizens on the basis of clear information
about the equality results they achieve ... Public authorities will have
flexibility in deciding what information to publish, and will be held to
account by the people they serve.' (quoted by Instead Consultancy 2011)
**[[This approach embodies a series of assumptions that imbue numbers
with an almost magical status and power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [First,
it is assumed that relevant and useful data will be made
available]{.underline} (despite the selection being in the gift of the
very authorities that 'the public' are expected to challenge). [Second,
this model of transparent data and active citizenship assumes that the
citizenry has the time, resources, and expertise to access the data and
then analyze it. Finally, the approach takes for granted that public
bodies will automatically change their behavior if the data reveal poor
'equality results'. **[Unfortunately, in the real world, none of these
assumptions is true.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Statistics do not simply lie around waiting for interested citizens to
pick them up and use them**. [Numbers are no more obvious, neutral, and
factual than any other form of data]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Statistics are
socially constructed in exactly the same way that interview data and
survey returns are constructed i.e. through a design process that
includes, for example, decisions about which issues should (and should
not) be researched, what kinds of question should be asked, how
information is to be analyzed, and which findings should be shared
publicly]{.underline}. [Even given the very best intentions (and
notwithstanding the opportunity for game-playing and 'creative
book-keeping' of the sort already documented above) at every stage there
is the possibility for decisions to be taken that obscure or
misrepresent issues that could be vital to those concerned with social
justice]{.underline}. In view of the limits of space, a single -- but
important -- example will suffice. It [concerns racial justice and the
question of access to, and achievement in]{.underline}, UK [higher
education.]{.underline} It is a scandal that ethnic minority kids are
more likely to go to university than poor white ones The Telegraph
(Kirkup 2015) White British pupils least likely to go to university,
says research The Guardian (Khomami 2015) White British pupils fall
behind ethnic groups in race for university: All minorities now more
likely to go into higher education Daily Mail (Doughty 2015) These
headlines appeared in the British daily press in November 2015 when an
economic think tank (the Institute for Fiscal Studies -- IFS) publicized
a review of government figures showing the proportion of young people
going into the university from different ethnic groups (Crawford and
Greaves 2015). [First, as we might expect when applying a CRT
perspective that is sensitive to the positioning of White people at the
heart of contemporary politics, it is striking that the relatively low
rate for White students is the angle highlighted by all news outlets
regardless of their political positioning]{.underline}. Including, for
example, the most left-wing (Guardian) and right-wing (Telegraph and
Mail) parts of the mainstream British media. A second important aspect
to this story, that may surprise some readers, is that there is nothing
new in the fact that White students are less likely to enter British
universities than their peers in most minoritized groups. This pattern
was already known 18 years before these headlines: 'relative to their
share in the population ... ethnic minorities overall are now better
represented in HE than whites' (Coffield and Vignoles 1997 original
emphasis). [From the perspective of this paper, **focusing on the
mis/uses of numbers in race analyses**, perhaps the most important
aspect of the IFS report, and the associated newspaper headlines, is
that a focus on access statistics in isolation gives an extremely
partial, indeed biased, view of race]{.underline} and Higher Education
in Britain. [S]{.underline}imply looking at who goes to university
ignores long-standing and significant race inequities in the status of
the universities attended and the level of final degree achievement.

Figure 1 shows the likelihood of attending an elite research-intensive
university in the UK (the so-called 'Russell Group' of universities).2
White and minoritized students appear to have roughly similar chances of
attending elite universities if all minoritized students are lumped
together in a single 'non-White' group, usually referred to as BME in
the UK (Black and Minority Ethnic). However, if the minoritized students
are disaggregated into smaller and more meaningful groups, some
important differences emerge. Figure 2 compares the proportion of White
young people entering Russell Group universities against the rate for
the most- and least-likely minority ethnic groups, Indian and Black
Caribbean students respectively.3 White British students are almost five
times more likely to gain access to elite

Figure 1 and Figure 2. Omitted

research-intensive universities than their peers of Black Caribbean
background. [This is a **sizeable inequality of opportunity but is
invisible in calculations that simply aggregate all minoritized
students** (such as Figure 1) or which look at access to all
universities regardless of their standing (such as the national
headlines quoted above).]{.underline} The inflammatory headlines that
proclaimed the 'scandal' of White rates of access to university (above)
draw attention away from a further facet of race inequity in the system
i.e. differing levels of achievement between ethnic groups. Table 1
shows the proportions of students in each main ethnic group attaining
the different classes of degree available at the end of their
undergraduate studies; ranging from the very best result (a first class
degree) through to a 'third' or 'pass' degree classification. White
students are more likely to gain a 'First' than any other group (22.4%);
Black students are the least likely to be awarded first class degrees
(8.7% of Black students overall). This means that the odds of White
undergraduates achieving the highest degree classification are around
three times higher than their Black peers.[4 This is a significant
ethnic inequality but, perhaps because the beneficiaries are White, it
goes entirely unremarked in the press furore about the overall access
statistics (above). It is clear, therefore, that there is nothing
obvious, neutral nor simple about education statistics and
race]{.underline}. In this section, we have reviewed official data that
describe differences in university access and achievement in relation to
the ethnic origin of undergraduates in British universities. The
government, an economic think tank, and the mainstream media all chose
to highlight the apparent under-representation of White students (when
looking at access across the entire system). This played into the
ongoing high-profile political and media narrative that paints White
people as race-victims in contemporary Britain (see Gillborn 2008,
2010b; Sveinsson 2009 for critical commentaries[). But a very different
picture emerges if the data are questioned in relation to a critical
understanding of past race inequities in education. Such a perspective
prompts us to explore differences in the status of institutions and the
levels of achievement at the end of higher education]{.underline}. In
both cases, White students appear to do rather well and, in terms of
achievement, better than every other group. Indeed, there is perhaps
scope for further headlines questioning what is happening in British
higher education when the ethnic group that is least likely to go to
university nevertheless enjoys the best chance of achieving the top
grade. **[Were this a minoritized group there might be headlines about
'scandals' and shocks but, since the group in question is White, their
high attainment fits with the basic expectations of a White supremacist
media and polity and so the pattern goes entirely unremarked. [Big Data:

broadcast and compute information is growing exponentially. The numbers
involved have already passed well beyond the scales we are used to in
our everyday lives]{.underline}. Counting across all forms of storage,
from mobile phone memory to DVD, Blu-Ray and hard disks, we estimate
that the world's installed capacity to store information will reach
around 2.5 zettabytes this year ... If we stored all this data on DVDs
and piled them up, the stack of discs would stretch one-and-a-half times
the distance from the earth to the moon. What's more, this figure is
growing by over 50% year-on-year. (Yiu 2012, 10) **['[Big data' is an

**[[has become big business]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recent google
search for the phrase produced almost 300,000,000 hits5 and governments
on both sides of the Atlantic are investing heavily in the technology
and talking up its transformative powers: Big Data is a Big Deal ...
Today, the Obama Administration is announcing the 'Big Data Research and
Development Initiative.' [By [improving our ability to extract
knowledge]{.mark} and insights from large and complex collections of
digital data, the initiative promises to help accelerate the pace of
discovery in science and engineering, strengthen our national security,
and transform teaching and learning.]{.underline} (WhiteHouse.gov 2012)
It is estimated that the big data market will benefit the UK economy by
£216 billion and create 58,000 new jobs before 2017 ... Universities and
Science Minister David Willetts said: 'Big data is 1 of the 8 great
technologies of the future and a priority for government. It has the
potential to transform public and private sector organisations, drive
research and development, increase productivity and innovation, and
enable market-changing products and services.' (Department for Business,
Innovation & Skills 2014) [Big Data advocates promote a hard sell about
the fabulous powers of Big Data. They describe a world where new
possibilities are revealed by an analysis entirely driven by machines
and where, most significantly, theories and human reasoning are rendered
obsolete because the 'numbers speak for themselves':]{.underline} the
following extract is from an article in Wired magazine, entitled 'The
End of Theory', which did much to popularize the idea: [This is a world
where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every
other tool that might be brought to bear. Out with every theory of human
behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and
psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do
it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With
enough data, the numbers speak for themselves.]{.underline} (Anderson
2008) **[The [argument that numbers can now 'speak for themselves' is a
popular refrain in Big Data discussions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Speaking
on BBC radio in 2013, for example, author Kenneth Cukier stated: '[We
have to let the data speak for itself. (...) When we trust the data --
look at the data -- it is a little bit less biased -- in some respects,
not in all respects -- than we are. And therefore it can find
correlations that we simply, as human beings, can't because we have
limited capacity (...) the vast amount of data has
expanded]{.underline}, we now have to give it to the machine to do what
it does best, and that is parse through it to come up with insights.'6
[Cukier's emphasis on correlations echoes part of Anderson's argument
from Wired: 'Correlation is enough.' We can stop looking for models. We
can analyze the data without hypotheses about what it might
show]{.underline}. (Anderson 2008) **[[This is a deliberate and
self-conscious rejection of the traditional warning that correlation
should not be mistaken for causation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When [Big
Data advocates ask us to 'trust the data' they paint a picture of
analysis as an almost mystical process that takes place inside machines
and is too complex for human beings to comprehend:]{.underline} '[We can
throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the world has ever
seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science
cannot']{.underline} (Anderson 2008). As we noted at the very start of
this paper, however, **[[algorithms are not free from bias: 'Even
algorithms are biased]{.mark} [against black men']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Naughton 2016; see also Larson et al. 2016). [And the reason that
algorithms can be racist is that they are created and interpreted by
human beings, many of whom share commonly held racist stereotypes. As we
have argued above, all data is manufactured and all analysis is driven
by human decisions. Although 'Big Data' advocates proclaim its insight
and authority with almost evangelical fervor, the limits of the approach
can be found lurking in the small print]{.underline}. For example, in a
book whose subtitle proclaims Big Data as a 'revolution that will
transform how we live, work and think', Cukier and his co-author accept
(contrary to Anderson's proclamation of the 'end of theory') that: '...
big-data analysis is based on theories, we can't escape them. They shape
both our methods and our results. It begins with how we select the data.
Our decisions may be driven by convenience: Is the data readily
available? Or by economics: Can the data be captured cheaply? Our
choices are influenced by theories. What we choose influences what we
find ... (Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier 2013, 72 emphasis added).
**[[This echoes our key argument that all data gathering and analysis is
shaped by theories and beliefs that are susceptible to racial bias. In
the next part of the paper, we set out some ideas for how the analysis
of quantitative data might usefully be informed by the principles of
Critical Race Theory (CRT)]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### AI data is being leaked and used to discriminate against people with disability

Bioethics (Cambridge University Press, 2020)

[[Many people with disabilities rely on technology to communicate,
socialize, and navigate physical and virtual environments]{.mark}. For
example, people with vision impairments use assistive devices to
identify objects while walking]{.underline}.6 People with mobility
impairments use voice-recognition software to access the Internet and
draft emails.7 Tom Gruber, a cocreator of Apple's AI-powered personal
assistant Siri, claims his invention helps disabled people engage with
society in ways that nondisabled people take for granted.8 These
[assistive technologies can increase the abilities of people with
physical and mental impairments. However[, **they also serve as
continuous sources of EMD, putting people with disabilities at increased
risk for discriminatio**]{.mark}**n.**]{.underline} [Imagine an
individual named John who is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair. John may
never have disclosed his disability publicly. [Yet **algorithms can
infer his disability through his digital
traces**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [After [profiling John and sorting
him into the category "wheelchair user,"]{.mark} [marketing algorithms
may serve him targeted ads designed to appeal to people in that
category]{.mark}, such as ads for wheelchairs and related
accessories.]{.underline} [This example seems benign, yet there is a
darker side to this type of categorization. On August 13, 2018, the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development filed a formal complaint
alleging that Facebook engaged in discrimination against people with
disabilities]{.underline}, [in violation of the FHA, by allowing
advertisers to exclude people with disabilities from receiving
housing-related advertisements.9 According to the complaint, Facebook
enabled advertisers to prevent users from seeing ads if the users had
been sorted into categories such as interested in "assistance dog" and
interested in "deaf culture."]{.underline}10 Similarly, John's
categorization as a wheelchair user could be used to exclude him from
receiving ads for employment, housing, and other resources. In addition
to violating antidiscrimination laws such as the FHA, excluding people
with disabilities from receiving these ads strips them of agency and
excludes them from participating fully in society. [Targeted advertising
can also harm people with disabilities more directly. Consider an
individual with an eating disorder such as anorexia. Profiling this
consumer and serving him customized ads for products such as weight loss
pills, laxatives, and stimulants can exacerbate his condition and
increase his degree of disability.]{.underline} Targeting ads to
consumers based on their unique susceptibilities is called
vulnerability-based marketing.11 It exploits people's physical or mental
sensitivities and reinforces patterns of unhealthy behavior. Other
examples of vulnerability-based targeted advertising include identifying
people with chronic pain or substance use disorders and targeting them
with ads for illegal opioids.12 **[[Disability-related EMD is also used
in a growing industry called "people analytics" that scores and ranks
individuals. Scores are used in a variety of sectors including
employment, lending, insurance, education, and public
administration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Chinese government is
implementing a social credit system that incorporates data from all
spheres of people's lives. It is intended to reflect people's
trustworthiness, and it governs access to housing, employment,
healthcare, transportation, and other resources including potential
romantic partners.13 Though the Chinese system may seem shocking to
Western societies, elements of the system have already been implemented
by American companies.14 Hewlett-Packard pioneered a score called
"flight risk" to predict when new or existing employees will quit.15
Th[e score incorporates data on divorce, serious illness, and the
frequency and pattern of sick days used. If an employee becomes disabled
and uses an increasing number of sick days for medical treatment, the
trend will be incorporated into the employee's flight risk score and
could result in early termination. In a second example from human
resources, [**Fortune 500 companies increasingly rely on AI-driven
interview** tools to rank job applicants]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
[company called HireVue provides software that analyzes applicants'
facial expressions, tone of voice, and word choice to compare them
against the "[ideal candidate" in various
fields]{.mark}]{.underline}[.[**16 If people with mobility or
communication impairments are interviewed by these automated systems,
their impairments may negatively impact their rankings compared to other
applicants**. Disabled job candidates could be screened out of the
application process before their materials reach human
reviewers.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The above examples may violate the ADA. Title I of the Act prohibits
employers from discriminating based on disabilities. However, it puts
the [burden on employees to identify instances of disability
discrimination and report them to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC). An employee cannot file a lawsuit against an employer
unless the EEOC has had a chance to investigate the claim]{.underline}.
**[[Yet instances of algorithmic disability discrimination may be
difficult for employees and job applicants to
detect]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They are often unaware that their
performance on the job or in an interview is being analyzed by
algorithms. Moreover, the algorithms used to mine EMD and rank employees
and job applicants are often maintained as trade secrets, the
confidential intellectual property of the companies that develop and use
them]{.underline}. **[[Even if the code of these algorithms was released
to the public, their logic is often opaque and may be inscrutable even
to the engineers who design them. Because automated employment and
hiring-related decisions are hidden from employees and job
applicants,]{.mark} y]{.underline}**et Title I requires them to identify
instances of discrimination, Title I is inadequate to prevent
algorithmic disability discrimination. Title III of the ADA prohibits
discrimination against people with disabilities in places of public
accommodation, which include private businesses that are generally open
to the public. Title III lists twelve categories of businesses that
provide public accommodations under the ADA such as hotels, restaurants,
and movie theaters. Title III could be used to prevent algorithmic
disability discrimination against people using social media platforms
and other websites. However, it is unclear whether these companies
qualify as places of public accommodation because the categories listed
in Title III do not include online companies, and historically, places
of public accommodation were brick-and-mortar business. Many online
businesses do not fit that mold, and courts have been divided on whether
they qualify.17 In [National Federation of the Blind v. Scribd Inc., 18
an internet-based document repository was deemed a place of public
accommodation. The US District Court for the District of Vermont
reasoned it would not make sense for people to be treated differently by
the law if they bought an insurance plan from a brick-and-mortar store
or bought the same plan from an online vendor]{.underline}.19 However,
in Cullen v. Netflix,20 [the US District Court for the Northern District
of California disagreed, finding that because Netflix's services are not
connected to any "actual physical place," Netflix is not subject to the
ADA]{.underline}.21 [In National Association of the Deaf v. Netflix, 22
the US District Court of the District of Massachusetts reached the
opposite conclusion]{.underline}.23 The court said excluding companies
that deliver services online from the definition of places of public
accommodation would frustrate Congress's intent that people with
disabilities "fully enjoy the goods, services, privileges and
advantages, available indiscriminately to other members of the general
public."24 Until the debate over whether internet businesses provide
public accommodations is resolved, companies that operate within this
legal grey area may lack sufficient incentives to abstain from
algorithmic disability discrimination. Like the ADA, HIPAA has
limitations when it comes to preventing algorithmic discrimination. It
applies only to disability-related information held by traditional
healthcare entities and their business associates.25 It does not apply
to the growing variety of smartphone apps and websites that collect our
digital traces or the algorithms that transform them into
disability-related information.26 The legislative history of HIPAA
suggests its primary purpose is to protect people's rights by
controlling the inappropriate use of their health information.27 It
includes quotes by jurists, writers, and philosophers on the importance
of maintaining privacy. According to Janna Malamud Smith, "If we
continually, gratuitously, reveal other people's privacies, we harm them
and ourselves, we undermine the richness of the personal life, and we
fuel a social atmosphere of mutual exploitation."28 The ability to mine
EMD undermines assumptions on which HIPAA was based and expands the
types of entities that have access to medical information. [Before
making recommendations to regulate algorithmic disability
discrimination, I will explain why it is important to protect the
privacy and autonomy of people with disabilities by restricting the flow
of their personal data.]{.underline}

II\. WHY WORRY ABOUT THE DISRUPTED FLOW OF DISABILITY-RELATED DATA? In
the twentieth century, great strides were made toward securing rights
for people with disabilities, and the passage of the ADA is a landmark
in this process.29 However, [we are far from achieving full
equality.]{.underline}30 [To ensure that progress continues to be made,
we must observe how emerging technologies affect people with
disabilities]{.underline}. [There is a growing trend to segment, score,
and rank the population based on personal characteristics.31 EMD
collected from disabled people can serve as a means of sorting them into
categories that are assigned positive or negative weights before being
used in automated decision-making. [**Negatively weighted categories can
stigmatize disabled people and contribute to the narrative that
disabilities are bad**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[There are ongoing debates
about whether the differences between disabled and nondisabled people
should be described as "mere differences" or "bad
differences]{.underline}]{.mark}."32 As we progress further into the
Information Age, [human decisionmakers are being replaced with software
that will increasingly weigh in on this debate. By negatively weighting
categories into which disabled people are sorted, **[algorithms may
stigmatize disabled people and screen them out of life
opportunities]{.mark}** without considering their desires or
qualifications. Thus, what may have been deemed mere differences by
human decision-makers could be [**flagged** as bad differences by
algorithms.]{.mark} The disability literature describes two models that
attempt to explain the origins of disabilities.]{.underline} The medical
model frames mental and physical impairments as health problems
requiring treatment. According to the model, disabilities result from
the states of people's bodies and minds, and the primary way to reduce
their degree of disability is to correct physical and mental
impairments. In contrast, according to the social model of disability,
there is nothing inherently negative or disabling about having physical
or mental impairments.33 It is within the context of society, where the
physical surroundings and social environment shape the experiences of
people with impairments, that people's impairments become disabling and
affect their participation in society.34 [The social model has changed
the way people with mental and physical impairments view themselves.
Because it places the blame for disabilities on society, rather than on
people with impairments, it serves as a source of self-esteem for many
people with disabilities]{.underline}.35 [**[AI increasingly shapes our
physical and virtual environments and influences our culture. Under the
social model, algorithms that limit the opportunities of people with
disabilities contribute to their degree of disability]{.mark}**. People
with disabilities may wish to define identities for themselves that are
independent of their impairment]{.underline}s.36 Some people take pride
in their disabilities and choose to display them proudly as symbols of
their individuality.37 However, others may wish to keep their
impairments private and define themselves by other qualities. [EMD-based
profiling strips them of this option by sorting them into disability
categories without their knowledge or consent]{.underline}. Similarly,
people with disabilities may wish to make life choices uninfluenced by
their disabilities. However, in many cases, communities and societies
make decisions for them.38 If a wheelchair user cannot enter a concert
hall because the venue lacks a ramp, then the decision to attend the
concert has been taken out of the person's hands. **[[Similarly, if
algorithms exclude a person with disabilities from receiving ads for
important resources or opportunities, the algorithms have made life
decisions for that person. As many industries increasingly shift
decision-making responsibilities from humans to AI-based systems,
algorithms will increasingly make decisions for disabled people and
deprive them of some degree of control over their
lives.]{.underline}]{.mark}**39 To prevent this from happening, new laws
are required to restrict the collection and use of their data.

**[Illness and contagion are only part of the story of Haiti\'s
metaphorization]{.underline}**, however. Even the quickest survey of
global headlines following the disaster reveals (with predictable
frequency) reports that the earthquake had \'crippled\' the nation, the
city, the infrastructure, the agricultural or tourist industries, or
humanitarian efforts. **[Hospital and emergency responses had been, in
these reports, \'paralyzed\' and the government, according to no less
than former U.S. president Bill Clinton]{.underline}** (tapped by

all, disabled.\" \"When this emergency passes,\"]{.underline}** Clinton
insisted, \"then we know Haiti is going to have to get back on its feet
again. And we want to be a part of that\" (qtd. in Fabian).

These readily available metaphors of both disability and able-bodiedness
(Clinton\'s comments obviously invoking a Haiti-to-come that is
nondisabled, healthy, robust, standing on two feet) are in part simply
journalistic stock-in-trade

[[As disabled scholars]{.mark}, we find strength in community and share
deep bonds with each other]{.underline}. Within these communities,
[there is fierce loyalty]{.underline}. There is a strength within that
seems dangerous to the outside. [**[We are unruly bodies]{.underline}**,
**[classified by]{.underline}**]{.mark} society into a plethora of
interlocking [sets of **[dysfunction and disorder]{.mark}**]{.underline}
-- [because our neurology and our physiology cannot be contained into
normative expressions by medicine, by discipline, nor even by our own
shame]{.underline}. Though, when it comes to academia, we see a lack of
representation \[7\] and a lack of conditions enabling us in taking part
in scholarship with self-determination \[24\].

As disabled scholars researching, our experiences, particularly when
researching technologies within the context of our own conditions, share
peculiar commonalities. Be it around physical, sensory, cognitive, or
psychological conditions, we find ourselves represented in the
literature as objects of inquiry -- systematically belittled,
disregarded, ignored and dehumanized. [[Despite]{.mark} several [calls
for]{.mark} the [inclusion]{.mark} of disabled people in technology

intricacies of disabled lives from the range of human
experiences]{.underline} \[11, 52\].

[As disabled scholars navigating the academy, [we find ourselves
related]{.mark} to by our non-disabled peers [as a problem, needy,
difficult, unruly]{.mark}]{.underline}. We face disbelief in light of
our diagnoses ("**[[You don't really look

what came before.", "We are just learning about all of this!", "You're
so emotional!", "If this is a persistent issue for you, maybe the issue
isn't other people.").

As disabled scholars researching our own conditions, we are deeply hurt.
[**We read about ourselves as [disordered]{.mark}**, as **[an emotional,
financial]{.mark}** and overall **[burden]{.mark}** to the people around

full of the "language of the helping professions" \[16\]; even though we

to disability as politicized may be subscribing to a notion of doing
good, while not realizing and reflecting that what is allowed to be
understood as "doing good" is reliant upon entrenched sociocultural
traditions of ableism.

[As disabled scholars, we say this, (pain)fully acknowledging that we
have, in previous publications and inadvertently, done our fair share to
uphold this system ourselves, and acknowledge that we cannot claim to be
free from doing so with this piece or any in the future]{.underline}.
[This issue goes beyond individual blame, it persists as a systemic

In the literature on diversity, a significant amount of work has been
undertaken on issues of racism, sexism, and more recently, heterosexism,
and their corresponding privileges. However, despite discussion on
disability being more than decades old, with the mainstream disability
rights movement gaining momentum in the 1960s and 1970s (Wolbring,
2012), and the Americans with Disabilities Act having been enacted in
1990 (United States Code, 2008), notably **[[less academic literature
has addressed ableism]{.mark},]{.underline}** particularly within the
field of social work. **[[Even disability policy as an area of focus in
the literature is relatively new, given the large number of disabled
individuals in the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Schriner,
1990)**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This study examines whether and how
the experiences of ableism by people with invisible disabilities
(someone who might not be assumed to be disabled at first meeting, such
as individuals with chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, multiple
sclerosis, HIV, etc.) are disparate from those whose disabilities may be
more evident to others. Although members of this community use both
identity-first (disabled people) and person-first (people with
disabilities \[PWD\]) language (Dunn & Andrews, 2015), this article will
focus primarily on identity-first language, as this language comes from
a self-determination paradigm in line with both social work and feminist
values (Ladau, 2014; National Association of Social Workers, 2017). The
United States Census Bureau (2012) reported that in the 2010 Census,
21.3% of those of age 15 years and older had a disability or impairment.
From these statistics, it can be inferred that approximately one fifth
of U.S. residents are currently living with a disability or impairment.

enough"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lightman, Vick, Herd, & Mitchell, 2009).
Therefore, it is possible that members of this community experience
ableism in different ways than those who have apparent disabilities.
Ableism is the overarching act of prejudice and/or discrimination
against disabled people and the devaluation of disability (Hehir, 2002)
and corresponds with able-bodied/neurotypical privilege, the set of
unearned privileges held by nondisabled individuals. They are both
interconnected systems that maintain stratification around disability.
Ableism values physical, emotional, and mental capital, following
socially constructed expectations of ability (Loja, Costa, Hughes, &
Menezes, 2013). Queer/disability theorist McRuer (2006) posits that like
the ideal of compulsory heterosexuality, **[[ableism results in a
compulsory able-bodiedness, demanding that disabled individuals do
whatever it takes to enact a nondisabled identity however
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While sexism, racism, and other isms
certainly are prevalent in all types of systems and interactions,
Wolbring (2008) argues that ableism is one of the most accepted and
widespread isms in society and works in conjunction with many other
isms. Because of the lack of conversation around ableism and
able-bodied/neurotypical privilege, prejudice against disabled people
may at times be more prevalent and socially acceptable than many others
types of prejudice (Ford, 2009). Although **[[ableism is insidious and
apparent in all aspects of society]{.mark}, [little research has been
conducted to understand the lived experiences of ableism by disabled
individuals, nuanced disabled identities]{.mark}]{.underline}** (such as
those who have invisible/less obvious disabilities**[)[,]{.mark} [and
intersections of other marginalized identities with disability
identities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover, while there have been some
publications in the field of social work around ableism, much of it
focuses on policy (El-Lahib & Wehbi, 2012), sanism (discrimination
around mental health) specifically (Poole et al., 2012), or the general
need for better culture competency in social work practice and education
regarding disabled populations (Carter, Hanes, & MacDonald, 2012;
Dupre´, 2012). Disabled individuals also experience higher rates of
poverty and chronic health issues than their nondisabled counterparts
(Hehir, 2002; Roux et al., 2001; Storey, 2007), and there are few
instances of social work around the experiences of disabled people of
color, transgender disabled people, and the ways that other marginalized
identities interplay with disability and ableism. Feminist
**[[disability scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** in particular **[[have
brought up the need for intersectional frameworks and connecting
disability to conversations around diversity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Kafer, 2013; McRuer, 2002; Olkin, 2002). In Feminist, Queer, Crip,
feminist disability studies, scholar Kafer (2013) explains that not only
did feminist theory gave her the ability to critically examine notation
of disability but also emphasizes the bridge between theory and
practice, something incredibly relevant to the discussion of disability
and ableism in social work. Microaggressions: Death by a Thousand
Papercuts The concept of **[[microaggressions is used to explain the
phenomena of the implicit perpetuation of]{.underline}]{.mark}** racism,
sexism, heterocentrism, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and other **[[forms
of power and oppression in society]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Sue, 2010).
Microaggressions are everyday interactions that perpetuate inequalities
and stereotypes against people who belong to marginalized communities
(Solo´ rzano, Ceja, & Yosso, 2000; Sue, 2010). They are perpetuated
against many individuals holding many different identities, including
race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability (Solo´ rzano
et al., 2000; Sue, 2010). **[[Frequent exposure to]{.mark}
microaggressions, including a[bleist microaggressions, can result in
higher incidence of negative mental health outcomes, feelings of being
excluded, and lower positive outcomes including reduced academic
performance]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Khattari, 2017; Nadal, Griffin,
Wong, Hamit, & Rasmus, 2014). **[[Microaggressions are a common means of
perpetuating ableism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[These may include
telling someone that they speak very well for a deaf person, telling
someone they are lucky to get to bring their dog everywhere with them,
asking a group of people to all stand for an activity (making the
assumption that everyone can stand), or making a joke about how fast
someone can go in their wheelchair]{.underline}** (Storey, 2007). Many
of these microaggressions are a result of assumptions about disabled
people. Storey (2007) found that **[[perpetuation of these
microaggressions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and assumptions **[[result in
disabled people feeling excluded or unwelcome in educational settings
and]{.mark} [produce]{.mark}]{.underline}** outcomes including
**[[anger, frustration, and other feelings that can be harmful to an
individual's engagement with their community.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Invisible Disabilities **[[People with invisible
disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** or illness may be **[[more likely to
experience ableism indirectly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including through
ableist microaggressions. For example, **[[while someone might not use
language]{.mark} like "lame" [in front of someone]{.mark} [they]{.mark}
[perceive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [mobility impaired,
they]{.mark} [may]{.mark} [be less reticent to use]{.mark} such
[language]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [front of]{.mark} those they identify as
[nondisabled]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether or not those individuals
actually are. Additionally, people with invisible disabilities may
experience ableism when using adaptations for PWD, such as
disability-designated parking spaces or elevators, when others view them
as nondisabled individuals. It is possible that **[[this is a result of
unintentionally fulfilling the role of compulsory
able-bodiedness]{.underline}]{.mark}** suggested by McRuer (2006),
simple **[[by not having disabilities that might make themselves visibly
distinct as disabled to outsiders.]{.mark} [Disabled bodies
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** frequently othered and **[[feared by
society]{.underline}]{.mark}** at large (Hirschmann, 2013),
**[[but]{.mark} [there]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [little]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**
may be **[[experienced]{.mark} [by those with
invisible]{.mark}]{.underline}** physical
**[[disabilities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mad studies, a subset of
disabilities focusing on mental health and sanism, have noted
similarities in the "coming out and facing stigma/not being out and
facing different marginalization" decision as faced by other individuals
with sometimes invisible identities (Pilling, 2012). Therefore research
is needed to help understand how disabled individuals who may not be
read as disabled experience ableism in their lives. **[[Bridging the
theoretical understanding of ableism into the lived experiences of this
community is a crucial move forward in creating more disability
inclusive]{.underline}]{.mark}** social work
**[[practice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This study explores the experiences
of ableism specifically for individuals with invisible disabilities
because, given that this invisibility often prevents these individual
from being viewed as disabled, it is likely that their experiences may
differ from disabled individuals with more apparent disabilities.

#### That culminates in the reinforcement of the logics of eugenics that threaten genetic engineering and other developing biotech.

GENEVA (28 February 2020) -- \"[[**Current developments in medical
research and practice may revive eugenic** **ideas if safeguards for

[today said the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with
disabilities, Catalina Devandas, during the presentation of her [latest
report](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/43/41) to
the UN Human Rights Council.]{.underline} The UN expert explained that
**[[developments in gene therapy, genetic engineering and prenatal
screening experienced enormous growth, increasing our power to repair
the body and prevent disease, but cautioned about \"eliminating\" human
characteristics deemed undesirable.]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"[People
with disabilities are genuinely concerned that **[these developments
could result in new eugenic practices and further undermine social
acceptance and solidarity towards disability]{.mark}** - and more
broadly, towards human diversity,\" she said. In her report, Devandas
also expressed her concerns on the impact of euthanasia and assisted
suicide for persons with disabilities. \"If assisted dying is made
available for persons with health conditions or impairments, but who are
not terminally ill, a social assumption could be made that it is better
to be dead than to live with a disability,\"]{.underline} the expert
warned. \"People have the right to live and to die with dignity, but we
cannot accept that people choose to end their lives because of social
stigma, isolation or lack of access to personal assistance or
disability-related services.\" Another major concern, Devandas stressed,
is the absence of persons with disabilities in crucial debates on
medical research and practice. \"Without their experiences directly
informing those debates, narratives suggesting that living with
disabilities should be prevented become reinforced and socially
validated.\"The Special Rapporteur explained that **[[\"ableism\" is at
the root of the problem. \"If the life experiences of people with
disabilities continue to be undervalued, no progress will be
made.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [\"What we need is a profound cultural
transformation on the way society relates to the difference.]{.mark}**
That is a commitment to embrace disability as a positive aspect of human
diversity. States must combat all forms of discrimination based on
disability,\" the human rights expert concluded. Devandas also reported
back to the Human Rights Council on her visits to
[[Kuwait]{.underline}](https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/43/41/Add.1),

ENDS Ms Catalina Devandas (Costa Rica) was designated as the first
[Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with
disabilities](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disability/SRDisabilities/Pages/SRDisabilitiesIndex.aspx)
in June 2014 by the UN Human Rights Council. She has worked extensively
on the rights of persons with disabilities and inclusive development for
the past 20 years, including with the World Bank, the United Nations,
and international donor organizations. Her work priorities include
socioeconomic inclusion, the promotion of full citizenship of persons
with disabilities, and embracing diversity/understanding that persons
with disabilities are part of human diversity. The Special Rapporteurs
are part of what is known as the [Special
Procedures](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Welcomepage.aspx)
of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of
independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name

### 2NC \-\-- Discrit

#### The alternative is an embracement the a framework of Discrit to rupture the line between ability and disability. Understanding race and disability on both a marco and micro scale is key to disrupt normative conceptions of ability. 

**Annamma et al 2012** (Annamma, Subini Ancy ; Connor, David ; Ferri,
Beth. "Dis/Ability Critical Race Studies (DisCrit): Theorizing at the
Intersections of Race and Dis/Ability." Race, Ethnicity and Education,
vol. 16, no. 1, 30 Oct 2012, United Kingdom: Routledge, pp. 1--31,
doi:10.1080/13613324.2012.730511.) // RB

Rationale for DisCrit Scholars outside Dis/ability studies might see an
article about dis/ability and think, 'This is a special education issue
so I do not have to concern myself.' However, [we believe that issues of
perceived dis/ability constitute issues of equity that involve all
people.]{.underline} Like Du Bois before them, [many critical scholars
outside the field of special education have recognized that the social
construction of dis/ability depends heavily on race and can result in
marginalization, particularly for people of color and those from
non-dominant communities]{.underline} (Gutiérrez and Stone 1997;
McDermott, Goldman, and Varenne 2006; Oakes 1995; Rubin and Noguera
2004). Given the racial gap in graduation, incidents of discipline, and
incarceration rates, along with vast over-representation of students of
color in special education and the lackluster achievement rates within
many of these special education programs[, we must critically examine
why so many students labeled with a dis/ability, particularly students
of color, are either experiencing failure or being perceived as failing
and on what grounds.]{.underline}

[We introduce [DisCrit]{.mark} as an [exploratory conversation wherein
we ask, 'How might DisCrit further expand our knowledge (or
understanding) of race and dis/ability]{.mark}?' We seek to add
important dimensions to CRT analysis by considering the ways race and
dis/ability are co-constructed. Our goal is not to replace or replicate
CRT, but to recognize what it both enables and constrains and then
propose the necessity of considering ability within the framework.
Indeed, we are indebted to CRT, LatCrit and Fem-Crit]{.underline} (as
well as Feminist Legal Studies), [along with Dis/abilities Studies
theorists, for laying the groundwork and stimulating our thinking in
this endeavor]{.underline} (Bell 1987; Berry 2010; Brantlinger, 1997;
Crenshaw et al. 1995; Delgado Bernal 2002; Delgado and Stefancic 2001;
Erevelles et al. 2006; Ladson-Billings and Tate 1995; MacKinnon
1998/2011; Reid and Valle 2004; Solórzano and Bernal 2001; Solórzano and
Yosso 2001). [W[e draw on many of these works, not to co-opt them, but
rather to **illustrate points of connection between and among
dis/ability and the various social locations theorized by these scholars
with the intent to further develop theory**]{.mark} that will be of
service in understanding the lived realities of people]{.underline}.
[DisCrit is an attempt to recognize a confluence between fields that are
profoundly connected but are, for various reasons, often unable or
unwilling to engage in joint thinking and efforts to solve issues faced
by people of color.]{.underline} [The aim of DisCrit is to push DS and
CRT to academically and practically bridge commonalities utilizing the
tensions between the theories as places for growth instead of resistance
and separation]{.underline}. [Ultimately we want to extend CRT and DS in
ways that are useful and thoughtful to better understand how concepts of
race and ability are intertwined. We [believe]{.mark},]{.underline} for
**[[instance, that racism and ableism are normalizing processes that are
interconnected and collusive.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [In other words,
racism and ableism [often work in ways that are unspoken, yet racism
validates and reinforces ableism, and ableism validates and reinforces
racism.]{.mark} For students of color, [race does not exist outside of
ability and ability does not exist outside of race;]{.mark} each is
being built upon the perception of the other]{.underline} (Crenshaw
1993). However, [because racism and ableism are 'so enmeshed in the
fabric of our social order, \[they\] appear both normal and natural to
people in this culture']{.underline} (Delgado and Stefancic 2001, 21).
Our goals, then, align with Delgado and Stefancic's (2001) desire to
unmask and expose the normalizing processes of racism and ableism as
they circulate in society.

[**[A DisCrit theory in education is a framework that theorizes about
the ways in which race, racism, dis/ability and ableism are built into
the interactions, procedures, discourses, and institutions of education,
which affect students of color with dis/abilities qualitatively
differently than white students with dis/abilities]{.underline}**
(Crenshaw]{.mark} 1993; Solórzano and Yosso 2001).3 [The qualitatively
different experiences of students of color labeled with the same
dis/ability in comparison to white peers in education settings is
illustrative.]{.underline} For example, students of color tend to be
educated in settings segregated from the general population more often
than their white peers with the same dis/ability label who were more
likely to receive support in the general education classroom and learn
alongside their general education peers (Fierros and Conroy 2002). In
other words, **[dis[/ability status justifies segregation and unequal
treatment for students of color compared to their white
counterparts.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Additionally, African American
students are '67% more likely than white students with emotional and
behavioral problems to be removed from school on the grounds of
dangerousness and 13 times more likely than white students with
emotional and behavioral problems to be arrested in school' (Meiners
2007, 38). Dis[/ability status works somewhat differently within higher
education. For example, although there has been an increase in students
with Learning Dis/abilities (LD) entering college, the majority of
students are white and from families whose annual income exceeded
\$100,000]{.underline} (Reid and Knight 2006); [signaling that being
white and possessing economic means allows a student with LD to gain
access to higher education. The experiences of students of color with
dis/abilities, such as where they are educated, with whom they are
educated, and their access to college, tend to be qualitatively
different than the experiences of their white peers with the same
label]{.underline} (Blackorby and Wagner 1996). The role of the liberal,
white middles class in maintaining structures and practices of privilege
within education has been documented by Brantlinger in her study of
social class and race interlock (2003). [Using DisCrit, **[we seek to
address the structural power of ableism and racism by recognizing the
historical, social, political and economic interests of limiting access
to educational equity to students of color with dis/abilities on both
macro and microlevels]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Connor 2008a). [We
[recognize that ability and dis/ability are perceived and created based
on ideologies of race and located within social and institutional
structures as well as personal attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Collins (1990) notes: First, the notion of interlocking oppressions
refers to the macrolevel connections linking systems of oppression such
as race, class, and gender. This is the model describing the social
structures that create social positions. Second, the notion of
intersectionality describes microlevel processes-namely, how each
individual and group occupies a social position within interlocking
structures of oppression described by the metaphor of intersectionality.
Together they shape oppression. (492).

[DisCrit seeks to understand ways that macrolevel issues of racism and
ableism, among other structural discriminatory processes, are enacted in
the day-to-day lives of students of color with
dis/abilities]{.underline}. Additionally, we [find Crenshaw's (1993)
work on intersectionality useful for theorizing the ways in which race
and ability are likewise intertwined in terms of identity]{.underline}.
Similar to Crenshaw's articulation of race and gender, [students of
color labeled with a dis/ability likewise 'have no discourse responsive
to their specific position in the social landscape; instead they are
constantly forced to divide loyalties as social conflict is presented as
a choice between grounds of identity']{.underline} (Crenshaw et al.
1995, 354). [Although Crenshaw does not speak directly to dis/ability,
Watts and Erevelles (2004) contend that students of color labeled as
disabled, like women of color or gay and lesbian people of color, must
also choose where to stand in social conflicts with groups that do not
fully share their identities]{.underline}. Moreover[, in terms of
dis/ability identity, **dis[/abled students]{.mark}** [are often
**positioned** such that they are likely (and even encouraged) to
**reject identifying as disabled as something that is inherently
negative or shamef**]{.mark}**ul**]{.underline} (Connor 2008a) [rather
than a potentially politicized identity or critical
consciousness]{.underline} (Peterson 2009; Shakespeare 1996). The
[consequences of simply being labeled as disabled, even if one does not
claim that identity, can result in rejection from cultural, racial,
ethnic and gender groups]{.underline} (Goodwin 2003). [Moreover, unlike
race and ethnicity, individuals who are disabled,]{.underline} like
individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender ([LGBT)
typically do not share this social status with their immediate family
members]{.underline} (Morris 1991; Shakespeare 1996). [[DisCrit draws on
insights from Dis/ability Studies to provide a discourse responsive to
the social positioning of students of color with a dis/ability,
reframing dis/ability from its subordinate position to a positive marker
of identity and something to be 'claimed']{.underline} (]{.mark}Caldwell
2011; Linton 1998b). The ways in which over-representation of students
of color in special education currently work, reinforces the racial
hierarchies the US subscribes to, namely[: (1) [the under-representation
of Asian Americans,]{.mark} which problematically allows them to be seen
as a homogenized 'model' minority (Lee 2009); (2) [the exclusion of
Native Americans in almost all research]{.mark} and continues to
emphasize their invisibility in education and larger societal discourse
even though they are vastly over-represented in many categories of
special education, particularly in states with large numbers of Native
American students]{.underline} (Brayboy 2006; Fierros and Conroy 2002);
(3[) the [overrepresentation of Latinos/Latinas]{.mark} in some regions
of the country where their population is high and the ways those who
speak a second language ntersects with notion of ability. Additionally,
emerging bilinguals are more likely to be over-represented in middle and
high school and this timing may coincide when they are exited or
graduated from segregated ESL or bilingual programs]{.underline}
(Artiles et al. 2005); and (4) [and the continual over[-representation
of African Americans across the US, regardless of social class,]{.mark}
positions them as the continual problem in American
education]{.underline} (Erevelles et al. 2006**[). [Each of these trends
in over-representation must be examined in relation to race and
ability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this case, [an additional
consideration would include gender, given that most of these statistics
represent males; at the same time, females of color are also
disproportionately represented in disciplinary actions, special
education and the juvenile justice system compared to their white female
peers]{.underline} (The American Bar Association and National Bar
Association 2001; Losen and Skiba 2010; Mendez and Knoff 2003; Oswald,
Coutinho, and Best 2002).

[As we frame our discussion of DisCrit, we draw on research that relies
on the statistical categories of ability and race because these
categories result in socially constructed inequities, not because we
believe they are necessarily biological realities. This is essential to
state explicitly as we do not want to impose identity categories upon
any one individual or group of people]{.underline}. Instead, [**[we seek
to highlight how the process of structural racism externally imposes
identities on individuals by applying socially constructed
labels]{.mark}**. We also hope to illustrate [how specific consequences
are associated with labeling]{.mark}.]{.underline} [We therefore
acknowledge that while ability and racial categories are socially
constructed, they continue to have real material outcomes in terms of
lived experiences]{.underline}. **[[DisCrit problematizes the ways that
binaries between normal/abnormal and abled/disabled play out in a range
of contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From the physical layout of K-12
schools, [where special education is often relegated to separate
hallways or even buildings removed from the rest of the students, to
universities where departments of Special Education are often detached
from Curriculum and Instruction in schools of education]{.underline}
(Young 2011). [Thus, in symbolic and material ways dis/ability occupies
quarantined spaces]{.underline} (Foucault 1977: Graham and Slee 2007).
[Sim[i]{.mark}lar lines are drawn in such diverse contexts as film and
media, to publications on dis/ability, to sports and recreation.4 Where
particular kinds of texts get published and circulated is another
salient example of this line between able/disabled]{.underline}. For
example, articles that focus upon the over-representation of students of
color are often published in special education journals, whereas
articles that are perceived as general education topics are published in
journals that are specific to general education. Thus, rarely do these
topics of race and dis/ability intersect. When those of us in special
education attempt to write for a 'general education' journal audience,
editors respond that we must give explicit explanations for why our work
should be read by those who do not work within the field of special
education. This professionally enforced line between special education
and general education journals sustains and encourages the
compartmentalization of these two artificially separated domains instead
of seeing sharing the same field of education. Furthermore, the
separation of research reifies the differences between ability and
disability, emphasizing divisions among educators and the students we
serve. We see this general--special dividing line being drawn in K-12
schools, teacher education programs, teacher certification, education
research, and society at large. It is a line that is focused upon what
children with dis/abilities cannot do, instead of emphasizing what their
strengths are and what unique abilities they possess. It also reifies
some students as 'regular' or normative and others as so different that
their instruction should be left to specialists. [DisCrit questions
[**how this line is drawn, how it has changed over time for a variety of
types of dis/abilities, who has the control over this line, and what
effects the line produces in education and in society?** In other
words,]{.mark} DisCrit recognizes the [**shifting boundary between
normal and abnormal, between ability and disability, and seeks to
question ways in which race contributes to one being positioned on
either side of the line.** Like]{.mark} [whiteness as a social construct
or the phenomenon of differential racialization, which both expand and
contract racial categories to include and exclude different people in
order to limit and extend benefits of being labeled as such, ability and
disability changes throughout history in similar ways and are deeply
impacted by perceptions of ra]{.mark}ce]{.underline} (Banks 2002;
Delgado and Stefancic 2001; Leonardo 2007). [In order to understand this
phenomenological 'line,' it will be necessary to examine ways in which
differential minority groups have become racialized in various regions
of the country throughout different periods of time -- and how beliefs
about of dis/ability affect those occurrences. Encountering the social
construction of dis/ability, many people pose the question,]{.underline}
'Are you arguing that there are no physical or mental differences in
abilities?' In response, we would acknowledge that there are, of course,
corporeal differences among humans though those differences are rarely,
if ever, as fixed and obvious as generally assumed. However, we are most
interested in human responses to those differences we currently call
dis/abilities.5 [We do not see the benefit of drawing what is inevitably
an arbitrary (and unstable) line, where certain differences are not
perceived as part of normal human variation, but rather become a 'thing'
so different that we must call them disabled.]{.underline} Moreover,
[the very notion of difference relies on something else being normative.
We are all different from one another. In other words, a person who is
perceived as having a dis/ability is no more or less different from
someone who is considered nondisabled than that nondisabled person is
different from him/her. Yet, the person with the dis/ability is
perceived as the one who is inherently different. However, there can be
no difference without a norm, upon which difference is
measured.]{.underline} We agree, therefore, with Baglieri and Knopf
(2004) who state, '[The question is not whether we perceive differences
among people, but, rather, what meaning is brought to bear on those
perceived differences']{.underline} (525, emphasis added). In the
remaining portion of this article we put some of these ideas into
specific tenets and then elaborate on each tenet. **[[We do so not to be
prescriptive, but rather to try to operationalize what kinds of specific
questions and issues can be illuminated from a DisCrit
approach.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[This chapter examines disability in relation to a keyword drawn from
the subtitle to this book: resistance. In this section,]{.underline} [I
consider how crip/ queer theorists have attended to the theoretical
vicissitudes of this keyword; I position their theorizing as itself a
tactic of resistance.]{.underline} Resistance has arguably had an uneven
history of late in critical cultural theory, perhaps especially in queer
theory. For a time, a certain foundational strand of queer theory
indebted to the work of philosopher Michel Foucault has emphasized a
theory of necessary or inevitable resistance. "Where there is power,
there is resistance," Foucault famously wrote. "And it is doubtless the
strategic codification of those points of resistance that makes a
revolution possible" (History 95, 96). As something called queer theory
was congealing in the 1990s, David Halperin, in his book Saint Foucault:
Towards a Gay Hagiography, was a key figure spelling out what
Foucauldian (queer) resistance could mean. [Detailing in particular the
ways in which Foucault's work makes possible an understanding of power
not as always and everywhere repressive but as productive, Halperin
insisted that "the aim of an oppositional politics is . . . not
liberation but resistance]{.underline}" (18). [For Foucault, in
Halperin's interpretation, dreams of "liberation" from "repression"
posited or imagined spaces outside power and could not really grasp the
insidious ways in which the very languages to which we are
subjected]{.underline} (languages of "sexuality," for example)
[materialize and secure specific ways of being and knowing and block
inventiveness and creativity. "Does the expression 'let us liberate our
sexuality' have a meaning?" Foucault asks.]{.underline} "Isn't the
problem rather to try to decide the practices of freedom through which
we could determine what is sexual pleasure and what are our erotic,
loving, passionate relationships with others?" (qtd. in Halperin 193--
194). The queer sociality that is Floyd's topic would, in this
understanding, not seek somehow to liberate an underlying essence or
truth; it would, rather, inventively generate new (and resistant) forms
of pleasure and relationality.

[A focus on practices of freedom that generate inventive new forms of
intimacy and indeed, "life" has likewise characterized disability
studies work on resistance.]{.underline} T[he most foundational work in
this vein, such as the essays collected in Shelley Tremain's important
edited collection Foucault and the Government of Disability, often
pinpoints the ways in which the supposed "truth" of disabled lives is
constituted diagnostically through the workings of what Foucault terms
juridical power]{.underline}. [Fixed with a diagnosis, disabled subjects
are then reductively understood through, and always and everywhere made
to speak the truth of, their pathology: this pathology and only this
pathology, juridical power might say, is what disability looks
like.]{.underline} [**Again, however, even as various forms of
authority, especially medical authority, appear to be always and only
negative or repressive, such encounters necessarily generate excessive
subjects speaking otherwise.** Tremain writes that "individuals and
juridically constituted groups of individuals have responded to
subjecting practices, which are connected in increasingly intimate and
immediate ways to 'life,' by formulating needs and imperatives of that
same 'life' as the basis for political counterdemands, that is, by
turning them around into focuses of resistance" (7]{.underline},
emphasis in the original). [Resistant practices of freedom echo across,
or are made imperative in, virtually all the most famous slogans of
disability movements globally]{.underline}. If juridically constituted
groups of disabled individuals are objectified by medical authority,
pitied by nondisabled others in and through that objectification, and
perhaps even encouraged and assisted (in increasing numbers of
locations) to end their own lives, [those constituted as such respond
collectively with assertions like "nothing about us without us," "piss
on pity," and "assisted living, not assisted dying." "This is what
disability looks like" is here put forward as a resistant counterdemand,
unfixing what would appear to be (in Tremain's words) "that same
'life.']{.underline}

T[he urgency of such counterdemands, particularly as they individually
and collectively reanimate those subjectified as disabled, underscores
Halperin's point that "such radicalism is not merely a radicalism for
its own sake, a fashionable attachment to whatever may look new in the
way of personal and political styles" (66).]{.underline} Nonetheless, as
queer theory in particular has flourished in the two decades since Saint
Foucault, achieving in the process a legible cachet and marketability in
the academy and in academic publishing (which arguably thrives on that
which "looks new" in relation to a range of intellectual and political
styles), a certain congealing of resistance, that perhaps could be
described as "radicalism for its own sake," is evident. A well-
intentioned critique of the mainstream lgbt movement's incorporation
into state and capital has as its flip side a longing for a somewhat
innocent figure of "resistance." In his study Under Bright Lights: Gay
Manila and the Global Scene, Bobby Benedicto traces both sides of this
conundrum in queer theory: Indeed, much of the work on what might be
termed queer complicities has focused on how gay white men (or conflated
figures of gayness and whiteness) are implicated in practices of
exclusion and embedded in market capitalism. [This is an important focus
but I am wary of how it leads, directly or indirectly, to the
conjuration of a list of abstracted, othered figures: the queer of
color, the third- world queer, the disabled queer, the working- class
queer, and the like that are invested with the potential for
transgression by virtue of their exclusion and on whom faith is placed
for a still radical politics.]{.underline} (13-- 14, emphasis in the
original) [Benedicto's important project thus attempts to pull back from
abstraction, particularly removing the "third- world queer"]{.underline}
(a figure based in the Philippines, in Benedicto's anthropological
study, but a figure who imagines himself as a citizen of a global gay
network) from a space of innocence: "the third- world queer is not just
the other but an other that makes his own others: 'He' is at the center
of the city and at the margins of the world" (14). "His own others," in
the Manila of Under Bright Lights, are often haunting, disabled figures,
"as when gay men drive around at night to head to the clubs, but are
suddenly caught in standstill traffic and come face- to- face with the
vagrants on the road: the old blind men and women with their plastic
cups stretched out and their walking sticks tapping lightly on the
wheels" (11). This passage, of course, arguably participates in exactly
what it is critiquing, as blind men and women are objectified, made into
others, through Benedicto's staging of the scene; the very syntax of the
passage performs what it purports to describe, as the colon points
toward vagrants made into objects. Still, Benedicto's larger point
remains: if any queer theoretical location has invoked or produced the
third- world queer as the figure "on whom faith is placed for a still
radical politics," such claims should always be subjected to scrutiny.
Under Bright Lights, at its best, disallows any innocent investment in
the third- world queer, and by extension any innocent investment in
other abstracted figures.

Resistance as it has congealed in some queer theoretical texts, for
Benedicto is thus not necessarily something to aim for: "I want to
suspend the academic desire to spot difference and resistance, and to
acknowledge that local agency also works in the service of modernist
aspirations, that it can be mobilized to reproduce the center in the
margins, is constrained by the force of material environments, and
remains animated by narratives of progress and modernity" (17). It's
worth pointing out, however, that simply spotting difference and
resistance is already a compromise of Foucauldian resistance, as
Halperin's study makes clear. That is because spotting, identifying, and
putting faith in a figure endows that figure with a substance or essence
that is untrue to the ways power works in a Foucauldian sense. Spotting
difference and resistance suggests that there is nothing left to do once
it is found; it can, essentially, only be admired. Foucault himself,
however, consistently turned away from the fantasy of simply spotting or
naming that which was supposedly or inherently good (and, of course,
thereby liberatory) or bad. In a famous quotation that would become
Tremain's epigraph for Foucault and the Government of Disability, he
insists, "My point is not that everything is bad, but that everything is
dangerous, which is not exactly the same as bad. If everything is
dangerous, then we always have something to do" ("Geneaology" 256; qtd.
in Tremain front matter). In Foucault's sense, since
identifying/spotting the third- world queer would always be dangerous,
acknowledging, as Benedicto does, "that local agency also works in the
service of modernist aspirations," is actually itself a resistant act.
Moreover, writing a thorough anthropological study of how that complicit
agency functions (including how it might function in relation to
haunting crip figures who emerge in the margins of the text) is part of
the "something to do" that always remains. This is not at all to
undercut Benedicto's aim of suspending the academic desire to spot
difference and resistance; it is to point out that where that academic
desire has conjured up innocent others over the past few decades it is
not actually resistant in the ways that concept has been theorized by
some commentators on Foucault such as Halperin or Tremain.

[Nirmala Erevelles, like Benedicto, is cautious about the ways in which
resistance in academic writing can become a mesmerizing but ineffective
"transgressi]{.underline}on[": "Poststructuralism's deconstructive
potential along with its limitless possibilities for (re)imagining the
transgressive body makes for seductive scholarship--- a point not lost
on disability studies scholars who have done radical work in
retheorizing disability outside the constricting limits of dominant
discourse]{.underline}" (12[). Erevelles's Disability and Difference in
Global Contexts: Enabling a Transformative Body Politic, however,
sustains a **deep commitment to collective resistance**:]{.underline}
"[At the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and
disability, we will find that collective resistance is more fruitful
than individualized forms of resistance"]{.underline} (120). [Disability
and Difference in Global Contexts is one of the defining texts in what
might be understood as a "global turn" in disability
studies]{.underline}; it is now indispensable for theorizing
intersectionality in the field. [As the subtitle suggests,
"transformation" is prioritized by Erevelles over a ludic
"transgression." The book also furthers urgent conversations that remain
underdeveloped in disability studies, considering in particular the ways
in which disability is often caused by the devastations of capitalism,
imperialism, and war. Throughout Disability and Difference in Global
Contexts, Erevelles reaches for what she terms "a common platform of
resistance"]{.underline} (130), [and rightfully critiques theorists,
including transnational feminist theorists, who do not or cannot
incorporate a materialist analysis of disability into their
work.]{.underline} [Erevelles calls for a **disability studies that
consistently theorizes disability in relational, transnational
contexts**;]{.underline} her call particularly resonates for me,
[writing in and about a period when a compulsory common sense about
austerity has been imposed (often forcefully) globally. As should be
clear throughout Crip Times, I share both Erevelles's critique of
hegemonic forms of capitalist globalization and her sense that
collective resistance remains urgent]{.underline}. I also agree with the
implication that a poststructuralist theory imagining what she terms
"limitless possibilities" would not be particularly resistant. Such a
theory would also, however, not be particularly poststructuralist, as a
rigorous poststructuralist attention to the instabilities of
signification should certainly not translate into a world of limitless
possibility but rather a world where the intertwined discursive and
material construction of limits should be continually interrogated. In a
slightly different context, Sara Ahmed reminds us that "the
poststructuralist critique of language was that words are far from
trustworthy . . . the poststructuralist turn begins with a suspicion of
words as much as things" (34); the necessary suspicion Ahmed writes
about is completely lost if poststructuralism is resignified (or fixed)
as agentic, individualistic, and limitless.2 [Erevelles's
characterization of poststructuralism as encouraging limitless
possibility would essentially, in Judith Butler's terms, "restore a
figure of a choosing subject," and ignore the ways in which the
poststructuralist theory Erevelles derides actually encourages
"collective disidentifications \[which\] can facilitate a
reconceptualization of which bodies matter, and which bodies are yet to
emerge as critical matters of concern]{.underline}" (Butler, Bodies x,
4). There is a difference between poststructuralist theory more
generally and an academic marketplace which can indeed encourage writing
that simply spots difference and transgression. [The existence of that
academic marketplace (about which both Benedicto and Erevelles are
rightly wary) should not obscure the fact that there is far more common
ground than her study acknowledges between a critical attention to
textuality, discourse, and the slipperiness of signification and the
**Marxist materialism and collective resistance that Disability and
Difference in Global Contexts puts forward**]{.underline}.3

[Arguing that "we shall need a literary imagination" to supplement
conventional forms of political resistance or revolution]{.underline},
Darieck Scott advances, in Extravagant Abjection: Blackness, Power, and
Sexuality in the African American Literary Imagination, a [reading of
bodily and mental distress in the work of Frantz Fanon that both affirms
the need for "a reservoir of resistance to the colonizer's acts of
subjugation and enslavement" and attempts to account for what is lost
when the complex workings of language and textuality are
discounted]{.underline} (94, 65). [Scott's analysis is not explicitly
crip, and yet his attention to wounded bodies and minds (the bodies and
minds Fanon tended during the Algerian revolution) has much to offer
disability studies, especially in relation to resistance]{.underline}.
[Surveying the ways in which Fanon writes about his patients, Scott
particularly attends to the ongoing metaphor of muscular tension. Fanon
examines bodies that have been beaten down and broken by colonization
and war and sees in those disabled bodies both the need for an active
and ongoing resistance to colonization and the potential for that active
resistance. Wounded, tense muscles, in Scott's reading of Fanon, are
indicative and anticipatory:]{.underline} **[they indicate what
colonialism and war have done and anticipate an active resistance, by
those same bodies, to colonial domination.]{.underline}** [Fanon can in
some ways be aligned with Erevelles here, since--- as I have
indicated--- she too focuses, more than fifty years later, on how
disability is often caused by colonialism and capitalism]{.underline}.
Like Fanon, moreover, [Erevelles looks beyond language and textuality
toward forms of active resistance that would counter those systems.
Scott, however, while consistently acknowledging that "the need to
continue this pursuit \[of active resistance\] is clear"]{.underline}
(9), li[ngers over the language of abjection, blackness, and
woundedness, discovering within it other forms of
resistance]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [Scott reanimates resistance in
and through abjection. If Fanon moves quickly from literal and
metaphorical broken bodies and tensed muscles to "**the robust
selfendorsement" that is ultimately a form of Black Power**]{.underline}
(9), [Scott examines what is lost in a too hasty dismissal of the
conviviality, in language, of abjection, blackness, and
woundedness]{.underline}. Although it is not at all his intent, [Scott
excavates an ableism that is inherent to Fanon's theory and by extension
any theory that would conjure away the twisted contours of the literary
imagination]{.underline}. Fanon's [postcolonial subject cannot locate
value in woundedness and brokenness; resistance only emerges when that
subject overcomes his linguistic relegation to abjection, blackness, and
disability. S]{.underline}cott, [however, pinpoints another form of
resistance that is always in circulation around the resistance, power,
and consciousness]{.underline} Fanon puts forward. The "fading scars,"
to turn toward the title of O'Toole's memoir, remain scars for Scott.
O'Toole's memoir might be understood as performing, in a different vein,
what Scott theorizes, although she more [explicitly combines Scott's
literary imagination with the (disability) materialism of Erevelles.
O'Toole writes, "My scars define me. I have often wanted to host a Scar
Camp where I can celebrate and mourn my scars with other disabled
people, where being scarred is the norm. . . . Where we sing and paint
and write and perform our scar stories. . . . Scars remind me that the
traumas of my past will always accompany me, faded though they may
be"]{.underline} (46-- 47). Scott would likely argue that "Fanon does
not value this form of resistance except as the sketchy lineaments of a
figure yet to be fully realized." Yet this scarred, wounded figure--- a
figure that is literally disabled but never named as such by Scott---
"[possesses an intriguing quality: defeated, **working within and
saturated by the defeat that constitutes its foundation and the limits
of its effectiveness**, yet not defeated, in such a way that it exceeds
the defeat and takes on a powerfulness that the defeat does not quash or
necessarily succeed in assimilating]{.underline}" (70-- 71[). Scott uses
the phrase "extravagant]{.underline} [abjection" to describe the
resistance that is legible in brokenness, wounds, and scars (10). In the
remainder of this chapter, I carry Scott's (and O'Toole's) theory of
resistance to a selection of locations, articulating extravagant
abjection to crip tactics that are pushing back against
austerity.]{.underline}

[Austerity arguably generates extravagant abjection, literally wounding
bodies and minds and then metaphorically redoubling that woundedness by
pointing to the faded scars and insisting that they merit austerity, as
they have no value and supposedly generate no value. Crip/queer
theorizing of resistance, I have implied here, is itself a crip tactic
that opposes both such austere ways of thinking and austerity as an
economic policy.]{.underline} In the rest of this chapter, turning
toward what I identify as an excessive crip sociality in the United
States, Chile, Spain, Greece, and the UK, I [note the ways in which
subjects in those locations collectively linger over scars, woundedness,
and disability. In]{.underline} Scott's sense, **[they take on a
powerfulness that defeat does not quash or necessarily succeed in
assimilating]{.underline}**. [The deconstructive potential of language
and a desire to find value in abjection are at work in each of the
remaining tactics in this chapter, alongside or in and through the more
recognizable or legible, active collective resistance that is needed to
counter austerity.]{.underline}

### 2NC \-\-- Schizz

#### Let's schizz this shit up! The process of schizzing is a commitment to the quality of sociality toward alter-economic postcapitalist futures. We'll term this schizoeconomics. The schizz cuts subjectivity as we know it liberating the neurodiverse from the grips of capitalism.

[Schizoanalysis is an alter-economic practice: its work is to unmoor the
financialization of the individual as metric of preexisting
value]{.underline}. [The schizz cuts through the middle, neurodiverse in
its call for the more-than. "[No]{.mark} [more]{.mark}
[normopaths]{.mark}]{.underline}!" it howls. How-else-with-and? [[The
schizz]{.mark} of the schizoanalytic practice [must never be
reindividualized]{.mark} by setting up the figure of the lone
schizophrenic, or any figure, as its cipher.]{.underline} Contrary to
some interpretations of Anti-Oedipus, nowhere do Gilles Deleuze and
Félix Guattari idealize psychosis or schizophrenia. [As everywhere in
their philosophy, [the aim is not to moralize but to couple the
pragmatic with the speculative, asking how processes unfold]{.mark} and
what immanent valuations run through them.]{.underline} The
differentiation they make between schizophrenia as process and
schizophrenia as entity is vital in this regard. The schizophrenic
entity "can only be defined in relation to the arrests, the
continuations in the void, or the finalist illusions that repression
imposes on the process itself" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 379). [The
schizophrenic process, or what they call the schizoid pole, refers to
the manner in which [desire invests itself in
sociality]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the schizoid pole, knowledge
schizophrenizes, passing beyond its own axiomatics, creating new
operations. "[[Figureschizzes" are produced "that are no longer either
figurative or structured"]{.underline}]{.mark} (371). [These two
operations, [the schizophrenic entity and the schizophrenic process, are
in continuous co-composition]{.mark}, the schizoid pole always also in
proximity with the threat of the pathological.]{.underline} Desire
schizzes, uncoupling pathology Cephalopod Dreams Finance at the Limit 8
290 Chapter 8 from process. [[Desire]{.mark}, the impersonal force that
activates socialities in germ, [is the revolutionary activity through
which new lifeways are produced,]{.mark} schizzing all the
while]{.underline}. What distinguishes the schizophrenic from the
neurotic is psychosis. What is of interest to Deleuze and Guattari is
that psychosis cannot be oedipalized. The neurotic is the one on whom
the Oedipal imprints take, whereas the psychotic is the one incapable of
being oedipalized, even and especially by psychoanalysis[. [The first
task of the revolutionary . . . is to learn from the psychotic how to
shake off the Oedipal yoke]{.mark} [and the effects of power]{.mark}, in
order [to initiate a radical politics]{.mark} of desire freed from all
beliefs]{.underline}. [Such apolitics dissolves the mystifications of
power through the kindling, on all levels, of anti-oedipal forces---[the
schizz]{.mark}es-flows-forces that escape coding, [scramble the
codes]{.mark}, and flee in all directions]{.underline}: orphans (no
daddymommy-me), atheists (no beliefs), and nomads (no habits, no
territories). (Mark Seem, in Deleuze and Guattari 1983, xxi) [The schizz
must always be considered in terms of what it can do, not in terms of
what it defines.]{.underline} It is from this vantage point that the
figure of the schizophrenic must be understood in the account of
capitalism and schizophrenia, with Oedipus always as the overdetermining
pull to the neurotic replaying, in all pathologies, of what holds them
to the narration of a preexisting structure. Oedipus should not be
considered an actual formation, however. The Oedipus complex is a
tendency in potentia: "it must be actualized in a neurotic formation as
a derived effect of the actual factor" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 129).
Psychosis schizzes Oedipus. This is why Freud disliked schizophrenics:
"For we must not delude ourselves: Freud doesn't like schizophrenics. He
doesn't like their resistance to being oedipalized, and tends to treat
them more or less as animals. They mistake words for things, he says.
They are apathetic, narcissistic, cut off from reality, incapable of
achieving transference; they resemble philosophers--- 'an undesirable
resemblance'" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 23).1 [In schizzing the
"neurotic territoriality of Oedipus," psychosis produces new
circuits]{.underline} (136). [There is no promise attached to these
circuits. They could just as well fold back on themselves, returning to
all the forms of neuroticization that reduce psychotics to the
apparently unmoored, disjointed paranoid figure psychiatric institutions
lock up]{.underline}. "Perhaps there is only one illness, neurosis, the
Oedipal decay against which all the pathogenic interruptions of the
process should be measured" (319). In pushing up against what can be
extracted from the schizophrenic experience that resists the
neuroticization imposed on it, Deleuze and Guattari pursue the question
that most troubled Jean Oury and was central to the work at Cephalopod
Dreams 291 the La Borde clinic: "[How does one avoid the institution's
re-forming an asylum structure, or constituting perverse and reformist
artificial societies, or residual paternalistic or mothering pseudo
families?]{.underline}" (319). What techniques can be put in place to
schizz the institution's penchant for all that retriangulates? [Urgently
necessary is the decoupling of experience from the pathological
valuations of the deficit model.]{.underline} As in the wider field of
neurodiversity, [[the aim is not cure but a commitment to the singular
ways difference expresses itself and the qualities of desire, knowledge,
and creation it produce]{.mark}s]{.underline}. "A true politics of
psychiatry, or antipsychiatry, would consist therefore in the following
praxis: (1) [[undoing]{.mark} all [the reterritorializations that
transform madness into mental illness]{.mark}]{.underline}; (2)
[[liberating]{.mark} the schizoid movement of deterritorialization in
all the flows, in such a way that this characteristic can no longer
qualify a particular residue as a flow of [madness]{.mark}, but affects
just as well the flows of labor and desire, of production, knowledge,
and creation in their most profound tendency]{.underline}" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 321). Against normopathy, schizoanalysis never does its
work from outside the event. Sensitive to the schizz, it moves with it,
following its tendencies. "[Foucault announced an age when [madness
would disappear]{.mark}, not because it would be lodged within the
controlled space of mental illness ('great tepid aquariums'), but on the
contrary [because the exterior limit designated by madness would be
overcome by means of other flows escaping control]{.mark} on all sides,
and carrying us along]{.underline}" (321). From this vantage point,
schizophrenia shifts from entity to force, desiringproduction its motor.
"Like love: there is no specifically schizophrenic phenomenon or entity;
schizophrenia is the universe of productive and reproductive
desiring-machines" (5[). There is no longer "a specific, identifiable
schizophrenic entity"]{.underline} (6). [What there is instead is a
practice of the [schizz]{.mark} that [attunes to]{.mark} the
[multiplicity]{.mark} of "I, Antonin Artaud, am my son, my father, my
mother, and myself"]{.underline} (15). [Multiplicity in differential,
the schizoid pole explodes the great tepid aquariums of our pathological
imaginations]{.underline}. Beyond pathology, there are no criteria. "It
might be said that the schizophrenic passes from one code to the other,
that he deliberately scrambles all the codes, by quickly shifting from
one to another, according to the questions asked him, never giving the
same explanation from one day to the next, never invoking the same
genealogy, never recording the same event in the same way" (15). [Is
this [madness]{.mark}? Or [is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [psychosis]{.mark} to
be [found in the imposed adherence of systems on worlds too
differential]{.mark}, too multiple to tame]{.underline}? [The
schizophrenic is the limit case of existence that troubles our
certainties as regards the stability of subjectivity]{.underline}. To
repeat the mantra that drives chapter 5: "A schizoanalysis
schizophrenizes in order to break the holds of power and 292 Chapter 8
institute research into a new collective subjectivity and a
revolutionary healing of mankind. For we are sick, so sick, of our
selves!" (Mark Seem, in Deleuze and Guattari 1983, xxi).2
[[Schizoanalysis is not a practice of the individual]{.mark}. It is [not
a practice of pathologization]{.mark}, of singling out the one whose
neurology will invariably be considered a deficit. Schizoanalysis is a
practice of the event where I, even schizo-I, is not yet. That the
schizophrenic refutes the limited envelope of the individual is
certainly part of the story. But the work of schizoanalysis is not done
on the body (of the schizophrenic) per se. The work is done in the
relation where the phonic leaves its resonant traces]{.underline}. [[The
schizz]{.mark}, the effect of the schizophrenizing of experience, [cuts
subjectivity]{.mark} as we know it, subjectivity [as the claim to the
human]{.mark} ([the category that excludes the neurodiverse]{.mark}, and
all qualities and forces of life-yet-tobe-invented that threaten the I
as white, colonial, neurotypical being]{.underline}. [Capitalism breaks
bodies, its devaluation of qualitative difference at the level of
aesthetic sociality so complete that bodies barely hold up.]{.underline}
Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and all their offshoots are everywhere
palpable. [Capitalism breeds paranoia, the ground so uneven, our
bearings so unsteady, that we fold into a selfpossession that leaves no
room for what exceeds]{.underline} [us]{.underline}. Limited by the
hardening of our edges, we become more enclosed in our-selves, less
turned to an outside that would revivify the more-than that courses
through us. This is what Deleuze and Guattari are referring to when they
talk about how [[capitalism produces the neurotic]{.mark}, and, at the
extreme, the "sick schizo]{.underline}" (1983, 362[). A [schizoeconomics
is committed to the schizzing of capitalism]{.mark}. Its challenge is to
work in careful attunement to capital's own infinite appetite for
circulation and deviation]{.underline}.3 [Flows, processes, detours are,
after all, what capital is made of, its movements faster, more mad, and
often more creative than we would like to admit.]{.underline} [To
compose with capital is to coincide with its movements to schizz the
more-than that runs through them, connecting to the speculative share of
its own decidedly more-than human process.]{.underline} The cutting edge
of capitalism is in the financial markets, which have evolved forms of
abstract capital so abstruse, contingent, and objectively undecidable
that it is impossible to get an effective grip on them. They run
according to their own process, and sometimes run away with themselves,
periodically crashing and burning. The financialized economy is beyond
the human pale: beyond full human comprehension and beyond effective
Cephalopod Dreams 293 human control. It is a self-driving machine,
operating more and more abstractly, with no one in particular at the
steering wheel. It was created by the human, but not in its own image,
emerging rather as a monstrous offspring that turns back to engulf its
maker and drive away with it. (Massumi 2017c, 9) [To schizz capitalism
is [to develop an account of quality that can]{.mark} discern the
difference between cuts that breed the count of assets, and cuts that
r[evalue value]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its infinite capacity for
deviation, capital is a powerful adversary. The aim of finance at the
limit is always alter-capitalist, but it in no way purports that there
is an outside of capital as we know it. [To schizz capital is to watch
another limb begin to grow elsewhere. [Alter-capitalist futures will be
built]{.mark} of more than the schizzing of capital: they will be led
[by the development of practices that exert the force of other ways of
living]{.mark} in a logic that refuses the tenets that undergird
capitalism]{.underline}---the relentless drive to quantitative increase,
inexorable growth and inequality, the capture of life intensities for
profit. Practicing the schizz begins there, in the midst, [asking what
kinds of techniques can be crafted for those other logics, logics that
sidle, in approximation of proximity, an aesthetic sociality of
blackness, [experimenting with the minor that runs through a sociality
born in the being of relation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is to say that
the practice of the schizz is never structural, never aimed at a
totality, as though something as stable as capital-as-structure existed
and could directly be taken down. [The practice is transversal,
operating in the circulation of flows themselves. This modest aim may
seem useless. Indeed, it is: an ethos of the pragmatics of the useless
runs through it. It claims nothing as regards grand schemes of
productivity. Its proposition: [to practice the art of life-living at
the differential of minor socialities]{.mark} in a livingloving that
angles toward the instauration of new modes of]{.underline} (merest)
[existence]{.underline}. Schizoeconomies will not come into themselves
once and for all. They will always need to be (re)invented, at every
turn bringing with themselves new techniques for practice unlimited.
Capital is crossed by lines of escape, and this is what finance at the
limit exploits. "Capitalism is continually cutting off the circulation
of flows, breaking them and deferring the break, but these same flows
are continually overflowing, and intersecting one another according to
schizzes that turn against capitalism and slash into it" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 376). [Cleaving capitalism from within, [the schizz
produces]{.mark} social fields that may operate only for an instant, but
nonetheless provoke the seeding of a dif­ferent mode of investment, and
with it [dif­ferent operations of value]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paranoia
will always be around the corner, counting its coins, but as Saidiya
Hartman's Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments 294 Chapter 8
demonstrates, [minor practices of the art of life-living have always
existed, even under the worst conditions]{.underline}: "The wild idea
that animates this book is that young black women were radical thinkers
who tirelessly imagined other ways to live and never failed to consider
how the world might be otherwise" (2019, xv). "The revolutionary
investment of desire" schizzes worlds into otherwise-living (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 378). [[Desiring-production is the force against which
capitalism has no power]{.mark}: unquantifiable, in a logic of the
relation of nonrelation, desire as force too impersonal to claim bends
the pathways toward intensities [for which no preexisting code]{.mark},
no count, [exists]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why the schizophrenic as
conceptual persona is vital to the project of schizzing capital for
Deleuze and Guattari: the schizoid pole is the pole of
desiring-production and, as such, "is revolutionary, in the very sense
that the paranoiac method is reactionary and fascist; and it is not
these psychiatric categories, freed of all familialism, that will allow
us to understand the politico-economic determinations, but exactly the
opposite" (1983, 379--80). [Revolutionary desire is a practice, not a
tool. [It does its work transversally]{.mark}, moving waywardly where we
might least expect]{.underline} it. Writing of Mattie, a young
laundress, Hartman culls from the anarchival force of the photographs
that nourish her critical fabulation the force of what desire can do in
the face of racial capital's devaluations: Mattie has been credited with
nothing, deemed unfit for every role except servility, condemned in
advance of wrongdoing, and destined to be a minor figure even in her own
verified history. To esteem her acts, to regard rather than vilify
Mattie's restive longing, is to embrace the anarchy---the complete
program of disorder, the abiding desire to change the world, the tumult,
upheaval, open rebellion---attributed to wayward girls. It is to attend
to other forms of social life, which cannot be reduced to transgression
or to nothing at all, and which emerge in the world marked by negation,
but exceed it. (2019, 62) [Mobilizing the schizz, inventing
schizoanalytic techniques for practices of the event, requires diligence
as regards capital's (de)valuation of existence. Techniques must be
invented to learn to attune to the difference between finance unlimited
(neoliberal capital) and finance at the limit (schizoeconomy), to become
sensitized to what sanctions the extreme deterritorialization of capital
on one end of the spectrum and empowers the infrathin registering of the
ineffable on the other.]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari speak of
capitalism's process of production as unleashing "an awesome
schizophrenic accumulation of energy or charge against which it brings
all its vast powers of repression to bear, but which nonetheless contin-
Cephalopod Dreams 295 ues to act as capitalism's limit" (1983, 34).
Capitalism is a movement that skirts the limit, continuously coming up
against the dangers of crossing the threshold: "it continually seeks to
avoid reaching its limit while simultaneously tending toward that limit"
(34). This is even more clearly the case today than when Deleuze and
Guattari underscored it in the late 1960s. Neoliberal capital is the
flow of all flows. As Brian Massumi writes: "The 'capitalist process' is
how the capitalist system dips into its own immanent outside to draw out
new potentials for its becoming, or continuing self-constitution" (2018,
11). [How to invent platforms for schizoeconomic finance at the limit
that do not simply facilitate capital's seemingly infinite capacity to
capitalize on process for monetary gain? Precapitalist marginal
economies may give us a clue. For their operations, unlike those of
capital, are rich with emergent sociality. The notion of the penultimate
is vital to understanding how limit and threshold are mobilized to
engender the being of relation in these early economies]{.underline}.
"Take two abstract groups, one of which (A) gives seeds and receives
axes, while the other (B) does the opposite. What is the collective
evaluation of the objects based on? It is based on the idea of the last
objects received, or rather receivable, on each side" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1987, 437). The receivability of the objects in the account
above refers not to the last object received but to "the penultimate,
the next to the last, in other words, the last one before the apparent
exchange loses its appeal for the exchangers, or forces them to modify
their respective assemblages, to enter another assemblage" (437). The
seriality refers to the cycle the exchange produces. "The last as the
object of a collective evaluation determines the value of the entire
series. It marks the exact point at which the assemblage must reproduce
itself, begin a new operation period or a new cycle, lodge itself on
another territory, and beyond which the assemblage could not continue as
such. This is indeed a next-to-the-last, a penultimate, since it comes
before the ultimate" (438). The ultimate changes the assemblage and,
with that change, produces a new series. The limit is here understood as
"marking a necessary rebeginning," while the threshold marks "an
inevitable change" (438). "What counts is the existence of a spontaneous
marginal criteria and marginalist evaluation determining the value of
the entire series" (438). In the marginal economy, exchange creates the
conditions for an encounter that, each time anew, establishes an
emergent valuation. "There is neither exchange value nor use value but
rather an evaluation of the last by both parties (a calculation of the
risk involved in crossing the limit), an anticipation-evaluation that
takes into account the ritual character as well as the utilitarian, the
serial character as well as the exchangist" (439). [The immanent limit
sets the stage for "a collective feeling out" that cannot be done in
advance of the event (439). Both sides are altered not]{.underline} 296
Chapter 8 [only by the actual exchange but by their collective retuning
to the limit. What has been "exchanged" is more than an object. A
sociality has been invented that accompanies the object, supplementing
it with the allure of the event through which it came to
value]{.underline}. [[The economic cannot be reduced to the exchange
itself. It is a platform for relation]{.mark} that facilitates a process
of collective feeling-out that intuitively responds to the intensifying
approach of the penultimate]{.underline}. [Deviations in the process
will cause punctual redirection]{.underline}, but an immanent
choreography is in place to assist the process in not tipping into a new
assemblage. [[The potency of the penultimate is the sociality it carries
through the syste]{.underline}m]{.mark}. Consider an argument between a
couple. No matter how angry they are, the couple will argue with a
collective feeling-out of a limit, intuitively aware that to cross the
limit might very well untether the bonds that hold the relationship
together. The argument might sidle that limit, but the couple will be
careful not to allow the threshold to be breached. They will do this by
holding back certain thoughts, by attuning to the texture not only of
what is said but how it is said, listening for what might crack their
collective carapace, exposing them to what they cannot bear to hear. If
they do cross that limit, everything will be up for renegotiation, and
their relationship might end. [The penultimate is of course never
precisely knowable in advance---it is best known in retrospect from the
perspective of the ultimate (after the assemblage has tipped into a new
one). Attending to the penultimate means being sensitive to the field of
relation in composition. Holding the process to the internal texture of
its schizz is a way of attuning to the quality of a limit, collectively
composing the relation in relation]{.underline}. When the schizz does
the work of attending to the penultimate, what it does is value the
pulse of duration's serial rhythm as minor sociality. An exchange
happens but it is not here that the value is located. The value is
operative in the collective feeling-out that attends to the event's
composition. This can look like nothing. It can look like a simple
exchange between seeds and axes. But it's much more than that: [it is
the staying-with of the complexity of a seriality lived not as a
transaction but as a proposition for life-living itself. [Practicing the
schizz toward alter-economic postcapitalist futures is a commitment to
the quality of sociality]{.mark}]{.underline} highlighted in Deleuze and
Guattari's account of marginalist economies and sidelined by
contemporary capitalism's way of tending toward the limit. For capital
too, as mentioned above, flirts with the limit, pulling back before it
goes over the threshold. The difference is that capitalism remakes
itself through quantification, in the generation of profit. What is
being collectively affirmed in the marginalist economies is a mode of
existence. When there is a pull back from the limit, it reflects a
collective desire to remain within a field of relation. In capitalism at
the limit, quantification runs wild. Cephalopod Dreams 297 When there is
a push to the limit, the qualitative stakes are masked by the
quantitative drive. This has devastating effects whose runoffs create a
deviation of limit conditions that become capital's new field of
creative potential, the limits reset within the bounds of its own
domain. This can be seen in the cyclic crises through which capitalism
lurches, catching itself each time before it tips over (up to now).
[Schizoeconomics attunes to the quality of sociality in the collective
feelingout of aneconomic fields of relation where finance at the limit
revalues value.]{.underline}

[DisCrit supports activism and promotes diverse forms of resistance.
Many Critical Race Theorists **[call for activism that links academic
work to the community]{.mark}.** This avoids sterile ideas being handed
down from [the ivory tower]{.mark} without practical application as well
as 'studying the natives' wherein people who know nothing about the
community suggest ways to fix it based on deficit
perspectives]{.underline} (Dixson and Rousseau 2005; Stovall 2006).
[[**DisCrit acknowledges the need for activism and the reasons behind
it, but recognizes that some of the activities traditionally thought of
as activism (e.g. marches, sit-ins, and some forms of civil
disobedience) may be based on ableist norms**, which may not be
accessible for those with corporeal differences]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Those with admirable equity-based goals can inadvertently maintain and
perpetuate inequity for other groups. In other words, to **[suggest that
activism cannot occur from behind a desk may be missing a larger point
about what it means to resist forms of domination]{.mark}**. If [theory
can be violent]{.mark}, that is if theory can erase large portions of
the population by ignoring their needs and realities,]{.underline} [we
also believe [that **theory can be emancipatory**, **offering oppressed
groups a language of critique and resistance**]{.mark} (Leonardo 2004).
DisCrit supports diverse expressions of resistance that are linked to
and informed by the community, whether that be academic or theoretical,
pedagogical, or activist.]{.underline}

To summarize, each of the tenets we put forth shares the desire to
reject forces, practices, and institutions that attempt to construct
dis/ability based on differences from normative cultural standards. [[We
reject attempts at the containment of people of color with dis/abilities
due to their perceived divergence from normative cultural
standards]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Instead, we encourage society to become
more encompassing of diversity and perceived difference, at the same
time we question the very norms that create difference.]{.underline}
Becoming more encompassing includes removing the policing and
enforcement of normality, dissolving barriers that actively dis/able
people, and focusing instead on learning from those that have
historically been uniquely positioned as having what Baker (2002) terms
'outlaw ontologies' (663). As Matsuda (1987) plainly states, 'Those who
have experienced discrimination speak with a special voice to which we
should listen' (63).

Definitions DisCrit builds upon the legal activism embedded within
Critical Legal Studies (CLS), CRT, and DS. Its voice is as inclusive as
CRT's, with change agents approaching its strictly theoretical elements
in an expansive and interdisciplinary manner. It interrogates and
engages history, sexuality, gender, the whole person (body and mind),
organizational development, conflict resolution, family studies, and
personal and community agency. DisCrit places the disabled child in the
center as a subject rather than an object of their liberation. The last
element places it squarely within an African-centered approach to change
that predates even CRT in the 1970s. One of CRTs founders, Kimberley
Crenshaw, declares that it "is not a noun, but a verb. It cannot be
confined to a static and narrow definition but is considered to be an
evolving and malleable practice" (George, 2021). DisCrit is inspired and
driven by the spirit of its theoretical predecessor. Raush et al. (2019)
capture the definition of DisCrit as a theory and the possibilities of
its application in practice: Consider the marginalization that Children
of Color with dis/abilities and their families experience due to the
intersection of power and privilege around race and dis/ability\[...\]
**[[the DisCrit framework can be used to understand how a difference in
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., between
administrators/teachers/schools and families[) **[can lead to the
exclusion of]{.underline}**]{.mark} very young **[[children with
dis/abilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other social identities and
their families \[...\] (Raush et al., 2019 p. 45). In America, it is
dangerous to praise an unfinished project. **[[The passage of a law, the
change of a policy, and the adoption of an inclusive curriculum are
often seen as the conclusion of engagement rather than its start. What
DisCrit does is challenge/interrogate well-meaning law/theory/policy to
agitate for action and function as a reminder of the centuries of broken
promises America has made to its most vulnerable citizens and
residents.]{.mark} [With DisCrit, there is no sacred space for white
supremacy to hide]{.mark}. Furthermore[, there is no faith in a system
that has proven repeatedly that it is willing to view the codification
of best wishes as satisfactory for a population that should be grateful

and Implementation **[[Those]{.underline}]{.mark}** resistant to further
reform of special education in American classrooms **[[point to the
existence of disability law and well-meaning child-focused policy as

better]{.underline}]{.mark}** in its treatment of all children with
special needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), if applied equitably, would bring America
closer to its stated aim of inclusion and protection for students with
disabilities (ADA National Network, 2018). Further, the policy created
by the Division for Early Childhood and the National Association for
Education of Young Children, on the surface, acknowledge there are a
multiplicity of innovative ways to educate children in the American
classroom. However**[[, applying the most positive standards will be
limited without an interrogation of race and white supremacy. If the
default from which all changes occur is whiteness, then what of those
who are not white? If whiteness is the standard, then the beneficiary of
these gifts would need to be white or white adjacent to be worthy of
receiving anything meaningful from the system. With this in mind,
education of special needs children of African descent would first be an
exercise in diminishing their blackness to make them deserving of the
assistance on offer. DisCrit is forced to involve itself in pushing
against the othering of Black students and questioning the utility of an
exercise in whitening black spaces through pacification and policing of
Black bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}**---students, parents, administrators,
teachers---any Black body.

[In [Booker T. Washington's]{.mark}]{.underline} famous 1895 [Atlanta

[identifies]{.mark} that [a post-Reconstruction backlash

[Washington repeatedly asserts,]{.underline} as most commentators note,
[the important role that African Americans ought to play as the laboring
race in the industrial development of a New South]{.underline}.48 But
[Washington's selling of [African Americans as the "most patient,
faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful" workforce]{.mark}]{.underline}
that mill owners and manufacturers might hire [[is accompanied by an
appeal as well to postemancipation myths about a disabled African

**biosecurity.**]{.underline}4]{.mark}9 [[As]{.mark} [part]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} his [["pragmatism,"]{.underline}]{.mark} it is
frequently noted, [[Washington]{.mark} targets---and [appeases---white
self-interest]{.mark}, but Washington also taps into white (as well as
Black) fears [and anxieties about African American productive
vitality]{.mark}]{.underline}. After assuring white southerners that
African Americans do not seek social equality---willing to remain
separate as fingers, but work as one hand in "all things essential to
mutual progress"--- Washington adds a thinly veiled threat that most in
the audience would have hardly failed to detect: the "nearly sixteen
millions of hands will aid you in pulling your load upward,"
[[Washington]{.underline} [warns]{.underline}]{.mark}, or, switching
suddenly from the synecdoche of "hands" to the first person, [as if to
call attention to his own embodied presence, "[we shall prove a
veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing]{.mark}, ~~retarding~~
\[slowing down\] [every effort to advance the body

Washington notes here, [dying race in the absence of their masters' care
and protection]{.mark}]{.underline} (see chapters 1 and 2).50 [But [what
does it mean]{.mark}, we need to ask, that Washington frames African
American progress---[the question of African American
citizenship]{.mark}--- [around an **opposition between Black capacity
and debility?**]{.mark}]{.underline} What does it mean that commentators
have erased this line in their remembering of Washington's speech and in
the repeated criticism of his failure to demand immediate civil or
political rights, or both? [Washington's compromise speech talks
back]{.underline}, as we will see in chapter 1, [to postemancipation
debates over the contagious, disabled, and dying African American by
reframing and placing these health disparities in the larger context of
a post Reconstruction vitality politics. In his promotion of Black
labor]{.underline} in the New Southern economy [Washington pinpoints
that [postemancipation antiblackness revolved]{.mark}]{.underline}
around [[not just the denial of rights---to work,]{.mark} to public
access, to opportunity---[but]{.mark} that [antiblackness in the
afterlife of slavery functions through]{.mark} the [creating of cycles
of debilitation and recovery that keep African Americans always on the
edge of health]{.mark} and, thus, [as]{.mark} the [surplus laborers in
racial capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Washington implies in his
address, conserving the "wages of whiteness" (to borrow David Roediger's
famous phrase) means neglecting and debilitating black bodies and minds
to naturalize their comparative inadequacy.51 In tracing out the diverse
techniques grouped under the idea of biopower, or the way politics
intervenes into the vital characteristics of biological and mental life,
Michel Foucault distinguished between two general technologies: although
much of Foucault's early work focused on the production of individual
discipline or the individual's internalizing of the surveillance,
control, and norms implemented in the factory, the schoolhouse, the
asylum, and the prison, Foucault's later work focused on a biopolitics
that operated on the level of populations.52 As part of this biopolitics
in mass, social scientists, public health officials, reformers,
politicians, and race activists sought to track, survey, and regulate
various demographics' births, life expectancy, mortality, and general
level of health. [As Washington's often redacted appeal to the
debilitated Black body reveals]{.underline}, [as part of]{.underline}
the post-Reconstruction [[racial reordering, biopolitics broadened and
shifted from tactics of direct exclusion]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [a
dialectical regime of imposed Black debility]{.mark} followed by
surveillance, recovery, and assistance toward optimized
capacity]{.underline}, or what post-Reconstruction commentators called
vitality, according to the demands of an industrial labor market.53 As
part of U.S. national fantasies of liberal meritocracy, all citizens had
to learn to monitor, assess, and "conserve" their vital resources for
their personal success as well as the conservation of the race. However,
a post Reconstruction [[politics of Black debility worked through an
environmentally produced corporeal]{.mark} [and mental enervation to
render freedmen and women]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [a contrasting disposable
population of decapacitated life]{.mark} [incapable of achieving]{.mark}
the aspirational promises of self-perfectibility, opportunity, economic
[productivity, material success, and mobility]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As
a result]{.mark}, "New ~~Negroes~~ \[Blacks\]" in [racial uplift's
politics of respectability were not simply "policed"]{.mark} according
to the norms of middle-class propriety.]{.underline}54 [[They were
debilitated,]{.underline}]{.mark} and, [[as a
result]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[post-Reconstruction]{.mark} period
[saw a shift toward data gathering]{.mark}]{.underline} and actuarial
assessments by insurance companies and public health officials [[that
broke down the African American]{.mark} "citizen-patient" [into an
assemblage of risks, statistics, and biomedical predictions that created
new]{.mark} networked [forms of surveillance and
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Race leaders' rehabilitative program and
their invocation of a language of recovery and cure, however, sought to
regulate particularly the behavior of Black women and the poor. I want
to end this initial brief historical contextualization of early
twentieth-century vitality politics by looking at National ~~Negro~~

In my original plan for this book, I had intended to say much more about
the legacy of vitality politics in Michelle Obama's "Let's Move"
antiobesity campaign, and to unpack its continued practice in Flint,
Michigan's lead-poisoned water crisis. While [[I
was]{.mark}]{.underline} completing this book and [[meditating
on]{.mark} [the afterlife of]{.mark} these historical [intersections of
slow violence, Black debility, and fugitive
justice]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [the 2016 presidential election
occurred, and all seemed changed, changed utterly]{.underline}. [[I
began to suspect that concluding with]{.underline}]{.mark} [these
[stories of historical recurrence may not]{.mark} fully [address the
questions we need to ask]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the long history of
[antiblackness and African American debility:]{.mark} what are the
stories worth telling in our current]{.underline} twenty-first-century
[cultural moment]{.underline} and, as importantly, [[what are the
questions we need to ask]{.mark} [in telling these stories to
**intervene and to imagine alternative social, economic, and political
possibilities**?]{.mark}]{.underline} During and now after the 2016
election, as it has been frequently noted, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [witnessed a resurgence]{.mark} [of white
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} [(or at least its unabashed expression)
[and intensified antiblackness]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [[what
interested]{.mark} [me was how the material-semiotic sign of Black
debility]{.mark} [functioned as a key relationality within]{.mark} a
less overt [conservative white racism]{.mark},]{.underline} [[which
reconstituted white citizenship for]{.mark} a [supposedly]{.mark}
[postrace]{.mark} multicultural [America]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
[this time [questions of Black debility had]{.mark} a [different
valence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although, as in an earlier
post-Reconstruction period, [[Black]{.mark} [debility was]{.mark} once
again being [invoked as part of]{.mark} a [white backlash against racial
progress]{.mark}, **[it had morphed.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[No longer
was white America defining itself against]{.mark} a strategically
constituted or permitted [Black debility]{.mark}: [it was]{.mark} both
[reappropriating this positionality as a sign of its]{.mark} own
[victimization while reauthenticating]{.mark} a decontextualized
[maiming of Black lives as a comparative sign of their inherent]{.mark}
and implacable ["noncompliant" debility]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[We can see this story of white America's "rehabilitation" and]{.mark}
the [utility of Black debility]{.mark} most clearly [in]{.mark} the
current [narratives about the opioid crisis]{.mark} [that]{.mark} has
[caused political commentators]{.mark} on the right and the left [to
question white America's decline and possible future,]{.mark} and also
Black America's intractability]{.underline}. In the remainder of this
epilogue [I]{.underline} will, therefore, [offer a discursive reading of
what I call "the gentrification of the drug crisis" narrative in public
debates about white America's needed rehabilitation in the face of the
opioid crisis]{.underline} in order [to trace out]{.underline} some
final [thoughts about Black America's structurally necessary debility in
U.S. citizenship-making stories]{.underline}. Then, as a way of
demonstrating how this narrative has entrenched itself in Hollywood's
popular overcoming narratives, I will offer a brief analysis of the 2015
film Southpaw that, even though seemingly offering a typical
sentimentalized story about cross-racial friendship in the boxing world,
reveals the new logic of a white identity politics that, like the drug
crisis itself, gentrifies a Black positionality and displaces its
devaluation of Black life in order to circulate a dominant narrative
about America's "great (white) hope." Specifically, in the 2015 film
Southpaw, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and is directed by the African
American Antoine Fuqua, we see how the main character, Billy Hope,
referred to as the boxing world's "great white hope," discloses how a
liberal white antiracist narrative of America's comeback story and
contemporary prison reform still depend on the drug-addicted pain and
suffering of an inherently different Black debility. [During the 2016
presidential campaign [there was a lot of talk
about]{.mark}]{.underline} America's---or at least [[white]{.mark} rural
and suburban [America's---drug epidemic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
As the candidates noted, citing the most recent available statistics,
37,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2013, but what captured
headlines, as [[Vice News noted]{.underline}]{.mark}, was the fact [that
[drug overdoses **"killed white people more than anyone
else**]{.mark},]{.underline}"14 or, as the New York Times reported on
February, 2, 2016, "Addiction \[Now\] Has a White Face."15 A study
published in JAMA Psychiatry in July 2014 reported that nearly 90
percent of recent heroin users were white, and about 75 percent of these
new users came from rural or suburban areas, many in states that are GOP
strongholds.16 While campaigning in key primary states such as Iowa and
New Hampshire, as a consequence, traditionally conservative law and
order Republican candidates broke silences and confessed their own
family histories with drug abuse. Jeb Bush shared his daughter's
struggle with addiction and the felony charges she had faced for
"illegally possessing prescription drugs";17 Carly Fiorina admitted her
daughter's struggle with alcohol and opiate addiction before her death
from an overdose; and Ted Cruz disclosed his older half-sister Miriam's
similar overdose death, explaining, "\[t\]hese tragedies are happening
in human lives all over this country---it's the human journey" (emphasis
added). Although not sharing personal family histories, Ohio governor
John Kasich also addressed what he called (repeating the language of
news stories in the New York Times as well as on NPR) the
"gentrification of the drug crisis." In 2014 Governor Kasich had passed
in Ohio the first legislation to make naloxone available without a
prescription because, at the time, the state had the second highest
number of overdose deaths. [I want]{.underline} for a moment [to quote
[Governor Kasich's comments]{.mark} before a Drug Addiction Forum in New
Hampshire because they [point out the troubling racialization,
structuring antiblack debility and emergent white identity
politics]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} various [survivalist narratives about
America's drug epidemic and the push toward more humane responses,
replacing incarceration with treatment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Speaking
to]{.mark} a largely white audience in]{.underline} New Hampshire, [[a
state still 96 percent white]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the
government census data[, [Kasich noted]{.mark}]{.underline}, "[[This
disease knows no bounds, knows no income]{.underline}]{.mark}, knows no
neighborhood; it's everywhere. . . . And [sometimes [I wonder how
African Americans must have felt when drugs were awash in their
community and nobody watched]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Now it's
in our communities, and]{.mark} now all of a sudden, [we've got forums,
and God bless us,]{.mark} but think about the struggles that other
people had]{.underline}\".19 As Kasich's comments attest, drug addiction
should be reframed as a colorblind disease, and five months later, in
July 2016, [[Congress passed]{.underline}]{.mark} a landmark piece of
[[legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} referred to as the Opioid Bill, or
more officially as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA),
[[that shifted]{.mark} low-level [drug violations from the criminal
justice system to treatment]{.mark} programs.]{.underline} The promotion
of such a public health response represented a significant reframing and
overturning of the nation's response to addiction during the Reagan era
"war on drugs," and we should not minimize the importance of this shift
toward rehabilitation. But [[such a therapeutic rethinking of policy
also depends on a new race transcending and seemingly]{.mark} more
[civilized disability]{.mark} (or addiction) [narrative that taps
into]{.mark} a [structuring antiblackness to rehumanize]{.mark} innocent
[white users, just as Black debility had functioned to legitimate white
labor privileges]{.mark} and enfranchisement]{.underline} during the
post-Reconstruction period. This ["[gentrification of the drug
crisis]{.mark} narrative,"]{.underline} as we might call it,
[[discloses]{.mark} not just a [racist disparity]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[between an earlier zero tolerance of Black crack
users]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 1980s and 90s [[and a]{.mark}
contemporary public health response to sympathetic white heroin
users.]{.underline} [[It also offers insights]{.mark} more generally
[into an emergent dynamic of a Black debility within]{.mark} an unmarked
[white identity politics]{.mark} [that]{.mark} often [comes to stand in
for]{.mark} contemporary liberal [antiracist multicultural
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[To]{.underline}]{.mark} begin to
[[unpack how antiblackness structures the white identity]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline}]{.mark} of this seemingly more civilized
"gentrification of the drug crisis" narrative[, [we need only look at
the legacy of a long history of antiblackness and
health]{.mark}]{.underline} that I have tried to recover throughout the
previous chapters. As I have argued throughout this book, drawing on the
work of Black Studies scholars such as Jared Sexton, Frank Wilderson,
and Alexander Weheliye, antiblackness encompasses more than racial bias,
discrimination, white privilege, and even violence. [Antiblackness
refers to a foundational structuring differentiation that continues to
govern Black lives in the afterlife of slavery.]{.underline} Not only,
thus, have [white supremacists invoked antiblackness as a
self-identifying racial difference, but [U.S. liberal notions of
personhood, citizenship, and agency have also depended on figurations of
antiblackness, or of Black disposability and worthlessness and
indifference to Black suffering and pain]{.mark} as a structuring
force.]{.underline} In his comments before the Drug Addiction Forum,
[Kasich]{.underline}, on one hand, [calls for empathy, but he also
invokes the larger shaping logic of a post--civil rights white liberal
identity politics]{.underline} ([one that goes unmarked as
"color-blind]{.underline}" amid the alarm over a more clearly vocal
white supremacism): [this white identity politics depends on, to borrow
the language of the drug epidemic narratives, a white gentrification and
appropriation of a Black positionality in the call for a universalizing
empathy]{.underline}.20 As Kasich's comments before the drug forum's
white audience note, whites are the new Blacks, for whites now share the
suffering and pain historically associated with an abstracted Black
experience, and as a consequence, the United Stated can now move beyond
identity politics to embrace, as Ted Cruz indicated, a universal "human
story." But [this [supposed]{.mark} postrace, [postidentity politics is
its own white identity politics]{.mark}, one [that]{.mark} although
seemingly antiracist (built as it is around a common pain of addiction),
[obscures the structuring position of a differential Black
debility.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC \-\-- Tech good for disabled 

#### Modern technology is unpredictable and we cannot rely on it to "solve" disability

**Schalk 18** (Sami Schalk, Associate Professor in the Department of
Gender & Women\'s Studies at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison,
(2018) *Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black
Women\'s Speculative Fiction* 105-108
http://library.lol/main/2C8F7A1D8C5F5DC42089719EDD904C24)

Through the origins of hyperempathy, Butler demonstrates how [[modern
technology can have unpredictable effects]{.mark}, particularly
technologies applied to human bodyminds. Such a speculative fictional
representation is not far from impossible given the incredible rate of
prescription drug consumption in contemporary American culture and our
increasing interest in genetic testing, selection, and manipulation of
embryos. [The representation of hyperempathy suggests]{.mark}, in its
critical dystopian form, [that we cannot know in advance what our
widespread cultural use of pharmaceutical treatments, genetic
alterations, and other disability-preventing/curing technologies might
have on our bodyminds in the long run]{.mark}, let alone on the
bodyminds of future generations.]{.underline} Butler's papers reveal
that she planned to extend this theme in the unfinished third book in
the series, often referred to as Parable of the Trickster. Drafts,
notes, and outlines for this text show Butler was exploring the idea of
having an Earthseed community travel to start a new colony on a planet
in another solar system. When the community members arrive, people begin
to experience different forms of disablement, which vary from draft to
draft, including blindness, epilepsy, paralysis, and hallucinations. The
idea that she continued to experiment with, based on these 106 Chapter
Three drafts, outlines, and notes, was that either the technology used
to keep the Earthseed community members alive on the trip, or the toxins
in the air of the new habitable planet, caused these changes, and the
community must learn to live with their altered bodyminds.12 Butler's
engagement with the effects of technology in the future is not simply
limited to (dis)ability, but also has important material intersections
with issues of race, gender, and class. When imagining a disability-free
future perpetuated by technological advances that will supposedly
prevent congenital disability and "fix" or "cure" all acquired
disabilities, it is important to ask, who will have access to these
advanced medical technologies and who will not? On whose bodyminds will
new and experimental drugs and devices be tested? Who will perform the
labor to extract raw materials for and construct these new technologies?
Who will benefit the most and who will be barred from participation?
[[If the history of medical]{.mark} experimentation such as the Tuskegee
experiments or the work of Dr. Marion Sims [tells us anything, people of
color, women, working-class people, and people in poverty will benefit
the least from technological advances and will be most at risk for harm
in the development, production, and consumption of new
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}13 In the Parable series,
Butler emphasizes that technology is neither inherently liberatory nor
destructive. In a journal entry dated April 23, 1999, Butler writes
about this directly, stating, "Technology isn't good or bad. It's part
of who we are, part of what we do. It's how we us\[e\] it is \[w\]hat
matters, of course" (Octavia E. Butler Papers, "oeb 1069"). [[Technology
does not have inherent value; rather, it is how we as a culture use,
misuse, and make available technologies that produces technological
enhancements and/or harm]{.mark}. Further, [the line between enhancement
and harm is not always clear---nor are the two mutually
exclusive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Enhancement for whom and harm to whom?
What kind of enhancement and how much? What kind of harm and how much?
As Butler writes, ["[Consequences may be beneficial or harmful]{.mark}.
They may be too slight to matter or they may be worth the risk because
the potential benefits are great, but the consequences are always
there"]{.underline} ("A Few Rules for Predicting the Future" 166).
Technology, the Parable series asserts in the face of the ideal of a
technologically created, disability-free future, is an ambivalent
cultural tool which is subject to both use and abuse, availability and
unavailability, and a variety of unintended consequences. Hyperempathy
is used as a primary example of this position on technology. As a
result, Butler encourages readers to un- Bodyminds of the Future 107
derstand that one's critical position in relation to technology need not
be either purely celebratory or, in Melzer's words, "paranoid rejection"
("And How Many Souls Do You Have?'" 177). Instead[, [we can evaluate
particular technologies within specific contexts of creation and use. We
can do so in solidarity with people with disabilities, p]{.mark}eople
[o]{.mark}f [c]{.mark}olor[, the working class, the poor, and others who
are more likely to participate in the creation and testing of such
technologies while being less likely to be the beneficiaries of the
results of such developments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Butler's published
and unpublished writings argue [that [technology guarantees neither a
disability-free future nor any other supposedly desired outcome since we
cannot predict its longterm effects,]{.mark} especially when it comes to
biomedical technology]{.underline}. In particular, the Parable series
demonstrates how marginalized groups, [especially people of color and
the poor, are less likely to have access to healing/curing technologies
and are much more likely to be the targets of destructive technologies
of violence and war. The suggestion that we cannot know in advance what
our impulse toward a technologically created, [disability-free future
might lead to may seem problematically foreboding because it potentially
suggests that the problem of disability-prevention technologies is that
they might simply create more disability]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
the second way that the representation of hyperempathy resists our
cultural idealization of a technologically created, disabilityfree
future is through the representation of disability-related pleasure.
Butler's creation of hyperempathy insists on pleasure as an inherent
aspect of the experience of this disability, a type of pleasure that
nonsharers can never experience. For example, Lauren states that when
having sex, "I get the guy's good feeling and my own" (Parable of the
Sower 12). During her early travels with her friends Harry and Zahra,
Lauren also shares their pleasure when they have sex near her during
their watch, writing, "I got caught up in their lovemaking. I couldn't
escape their sensation" (200). Later, when she meets Bankole, Lauren
again discusses sharing pleasure in sex, explaining, "Best of all, he
took a lot of uncomplicated pleasure in my body, and I got to share it
with him. It isn't often that I can enjoy the good side of my
hyperempathy. I let the sensation take over, intense and wild" (266).
While these moments of Lauren's shared pleasure are few in comparison to
the many representations of shared pain, they are incredibly important
to Butler's representation of disability in the future. The
representation of disability-related pleasure in the Parable series
shifts the ableist ways in which our culture typically understands
disabled bodyminds as both nonsexual and as always more difficult and
limiting than nondisabled bodyminds. Importantly, Butler does this
without making Lauren come across as magical or as the perpetually
overcoming, superpowered supercrip.14

### 2NC \-\-- You're not disabled 

#### Disidentification with disability and crip allow the mintrotain subject to refuse either fully conform or fully resist to dominate structurces

**Schalk 13** (Sami Schalk, Department of Gender Studies, Indiana
University, Vol. 33 No. 2 (2013): Self-reflection as scholarly praxis
,Disability Studies Quarterly (DSQ), "Coming to Claim Crip:
Disidentification with/in Disability Studies"
https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3705/3240 ) // RB

[As a young gender, race, and disability studies scholar, my entry into
and relationship with/in this last field of study is not the story many
expect when I tell them that I do disability studies.]{.underline}
Unlike many people in the field, [I am [not (yet) a person with a
disability and]{.mark} I am not (yet) the parent, guardian, sibling, or
partner of a person with a disability.]{.underline} Ten to 15 years ago,
being a nondisabled 1 disability studies researcher 2 with no immediate,
personal experience with disability would have been relatively unusual.
However, due to the growth of disability studies as an academic field
since the 1990s, more people are encountering disability theory in the
course of their academic careers whether or not they identify as or have
a personal relationship with a person with a [disability. Although I do
not identify as a person with a disability, I nonetheless have [come to
identify with the term \"crip\"]{.mark} as elucidated by feminist and
queer crip/disability theorists such as Carrie Sandahl, Robert McRuer,
and Alison Kafer. As a fat, black, queer woman, my experiences have led
me to have particular personal and political connections to the term
\"crip\" and a disidentified relationship with disability
studies.]{.underline} In what follows, [I argue that [disidentification
can be used by minoritarian subjects to disidentify with other
minoritarian subjects, communities, and/or representations and that this
kind of disidentifying process among/across/between minoritarian
subjects can allow for coalitional theory and political
solidarity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

By coalitional theory, [I mean [theories which are inclusive of multiple
minority groups without being limited to only those people who occupy
multiply minoritized positions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Regarding political
solidarity, I follow [Chandra Talpade Mohanty who defines solidarity as
follows:]{.underline}

[In terms of mutuality, accountability, and the recognition of common
interests as the basis for relationships among diverse communities...who
have chosen to work and fight together. Diversity and difference are
central values here---to be acknowledged and respected, not erased in
the building of alliances (2003, p. 7).]{.underline}

My goal here is to show through both my own experiences and [existing
theory [how disidentification with/in disability studies and
identification with crip offers transformative possibilities for
disability studies to make stronger academic and political connections
to other identity-based fields]{.mark}, particularly race/ethnic and
sexuality/queer studies---connections that the field has not yet been
able to make thus far in substantive and lasting ways.]{.underline}

As an undergraduate first coming into my feminist voice, I began to
embrace [my many [marginal identities]{.mark} and [understand]{.mark}
how [my body/mind/desire/behavior shape(d) my past, present, and future
experiences.]{.mark} I became a loud, at times angry, young activist who
consistently called out others on their white, straight, upper-class,
and/or male privilege]{.underline}. [When it came to the oppression
Olympics, I was a gold-medal contender, the ultimate minority, and I
made it my business to teach those privileged subjects around me how to
be allies to feminist, antiracist, and LBGTQIA 5 movements. I thought I
knew it all.]{.underline}

Then, during my sophomore year, I took an elective course for my
Women\'s Studies major entitled \"Women and Disability\" with Drs. Kathy
McMahon-Klosterman and Jean Lynch.6 In that course, I encountered my own
unrecognized privilege for the first time. While I was aware of my class
and nationality privileges, they didn\'t bother me because I easily
recognized them and tried to act as an ally as a result. The experience
of learning about (dis)ability as a social system of oppression and
privilege, however, one I had never even remotely considered, shifted my
entire worldview. I had previously scoffed at the notion of white guilt,
8 but my initial reaction to the revelation of my ability privilege was
also one of guilt. Though [it took some time to come out of that
emotionally reactive state, I did eventually begin to pay critical
attention to the ability privileges I receive each day and before the
end of the semester I had declared myself a vocal ally of disability
rights communities]{.underline}. [I did this not only because I
immediately made connections between (dis)ability and other systems of
privilege and oppression, but also because I realized that if I ever
again wanted to call someone out on their other forms of privilege or
encourage them to be an ally to me, I absolutely had to evaluate my own
ability privilege and become an ally myself.]{.underline}

The \"Women and Disability\" class led to other classes on disability
and eventually to a disability studies minor, a senior thesis on student
activism, and membership in the Society for Disability Studies (SDS).
The summer after I graduated I attended the SDS annual conference with
Dr. Kathy McMahon-Klosterman to help lead a roundtable discussion about
student activism. It was this conference experience that solidified my
relationship to disability studies.

Initially, I was simply thrilled to be in the presence of such academic
and activist greatness. I met Rosemarie Garland-Thomson at lunch. I
attended a workshop with Eli Clare. I sat behind Jim Ferris at a panel.
I had never experienced such an interesting, exciting, and friendly
intellectual environment. Something felt right about this space. On the
last night of the conference I prepared myself for the (in)famous SDS
dance. I had read about the spirit of SDS and the unrivaled nature of
its culminating dance in Simi Linton\'s (2006) memoir, My Body Politic,
so I was more excitedly nervous for this event than I was for my prom.
Would the dance live up to everything Linton made it out to be?

As I entered the basement hallway of the CUNY building where the dance
would occur, I could hear the music thumping with the strong trembling
bass used so people who are Deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing impaired
can feel the rhythm pulse. I entered the dark space to see a cornucopia
of bodies scattered around the room: people spinning, rolling, jumping,
shaking, wriggling, fist-pumping, sashaying, and bouncing in an
explosion of movements, large and small. I saw people in chairs (wheeled
and not) sitting on the sidelines clapping their hands or tapping their
feet as they talked, drank, and laughed, their bodies close, sometimes
interlaced. There was ethos of community and love in that room and
though I was terrified of knowing no one and not fitting in, I also
desperately wanted to dance.

Though still unsure of myself, when I located the unmistakable hair of
Simi\'s husband, David, across the dance floor, I headed over to join
their group of dancers. That night, my body moved more freely and less
self-consciously than it ever had before because, at this dance, people
were not watching me the way they sometimes stare or leer at dance clubs
or bars; folks were looking, but here with friendly excitement or
admiration. One of my dance partners that night, the beautiful and
talented Alice Sheppard of AXIS Dance Company, followed the lead of my
movements, adapting and responding to them with her own agile body and
wheelchair. Then she helped me learn to watch her as well, to follow her
movements, spinning, sliding, touching hands, and shaking our hair. I
didn\'t leave until the wine was gone, the music stopped, and people
started to disperse. I replayed the dance in my head as I headed back to
my hotel and though I did not yet have the language for it, [my first
Society for Disability Studies dance was the moment I began to both
disidentify with/in disability studies and identify with
crip.]{.underline}

[I am primarily using disidentification as elucidated by José Esteban
Muñoz (1999) in Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance
of Politics.]{.underline} [He defines **[disidentification as a
strategic survival strategy of identification for/of/by those with
multiple intersecting marginal identities]{.mark}** whom Muñoz refers to
as minoritarian subjects]{.underline}. [Muñoz\'s theorization of
disidentification relies upon Michel Pecheux\'s reworking of Louis
Althusser\'s theory of interpellation in which [disidentification is
defined as a third identification stance in relation to dominant
ideology that **refuses to either fully conform or fully
resist**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Muñoz uses disidentification similarly
to understand how queers of color relate and/or respond to dominant
representations, particularly through performance.]{.underline}

For example, Muñoz opens the book with a description of Marga Gomez\'s
performance piece, Marga Gomez Is Pretty, Witty, and Gay, in which Gomez
sees lesbians on television for the first time and is captivated by
their mysterious allure because the women are all depicted wearing
raincoats, wigs, and sunglasses to hide their identities. [Muñoz uses
this as an example of a minoritarian subject negotiating and
reinterpreting a mainstream image intended as negative. He insists that
the act of disidentification is neither assimilationist nor
anti-assimilationist, but rather, it\'s an alternative political
resistance strategy that works with and against dominant ideology at the
same time for the performative and political purposes of minoritarian
subjects]{.underline}.

In Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique, Roderick A.
F[erguson (2004) makes similar claims about the possibilities of
disidentification regarding queer of color critique\'s disidentification
with historical materialism. Ferguson writes that to disidentify means
to take up with revisions, to determine \"the silences and ideologies
that reside within critical terrains\" (p. 5) and refuse to take up or
extend legacies of racism, sexism, or homophobia in theory and research.
10 Disidentification is therefore a way to locate one\'s self within,
take up and (re)use representations and theories in ways that were not
originally intended]{.underline}. Disidentification is not, however, the
only useful minoritarian political strategy and may not be appropriate
or effective for all subjects or situations (Muñoz, 1999).

De[spite the fact that both Ferguson and Muñoz focus on queers of color
(minoritarian subjects) disidentifying with dominant (majoritarian)
representations and theories, both indirectly suggest that
disidentification can be used by minoritarian subjects in relation to
other minoritarian representations]{.underline}. For example, [Muñoz
suggests that a queer woman might disidentify with the work of Frantz
Fanon (2004), being critical of its sexist and homophobic moments while
still finding and revising useful aspects of the text]{.underline}.
[Fanon, a black psychiatrist and postcolonial philosopher, is not a
majoritarian subject, however, he is privileged on multiple fronts and
his discussions of women and homosexuals in Black Skins, White Masks,
for example, adheres to majoritarian ideology in regard to these other
minoritarian subjects. As documented by intersectionality scholars such
as Kimberlé Crenshaw (1991), Lisa Duggan]{.underline} (2002), [and
Jasbir Puar]{.underline} (2007), [different subjects can simultaneously
resist certain hegemonic ideologies while being complicit in
others.]{.underline}

[Taking up this adapted understanding of disidentification, I find
myself, a m[inoritarian subject, disidentifying with disability studies,
a minoritarian field of research, because although the field\'s
resistance to the pathologization of non-normative bodies appeals to me
as a nondisabled,]{.mark} fat, black, queer woman,]{.underline} [the
shortage of substantive race analysis within the field and the
relatively minor attention given to issues of class and sexuality
trouble me deeply and disallow me any direct Good Subject
identification. The whiteness of disability studies has already been
noted by Chris Bell (2006) in his essay \"Introducing White Disability
Studies: A Modest Proposal.\" However, the ubiquitous citation of this
essay as the reference for disability studies scholars attempting to
acknowledge race in relation to disability simply underscores the need
for more critical scholarship on race in the field at this time. 12
While this lack of a substantial amount of research on race and
disability does not necessarily mean there are also no people of color
within the field (because people of color do not necessarily do research
on race), the racial diversity of the disability studies researcher
population that I\'ve witnessed is minimal.]{.underline} [The continued
conspicuous presence of my racialized body at disability studies
conferences and events disconcerts me and makes me wary of being
tokenized. These emotions further facilitate my disidentification
with/in disability studies. Following Ferguson and Muñoz, because this
collection of theories and practices do not seem originally intended for
me, as a researcher I must take up and revise disability theories and
scholarship while refusing to extend its legacy of whiteness and
racism.]{.underline}

Despite the disjuncture I experience in the field as it currently
exists, I still have a deeply personal, emotional affinity with
disability studies scholar and activist communities[. [This affinity is
what facilitates my coming to claim and identify with crip.]{.mark} Note
here, that there are a few key [differences between disidentification
and identifying]{.mark} with as I am using them. [Disidentification is
primarily in respect to representations, ideologies, and theories which
have important, useful aspects that the disidentifying subject takes up,
uses, or revamps]{.mark} while leaving behind or being critical of other
problematic or damaging elements]{.underline}. [To identify
with,]{.underline} as I will explain more below, [is to personally and
politically align oneself with a group one may or may not belong to, but
with which one feels a positive connection. I discuss these concepts
separately in order to distinguish my relationship to the field of
disability studies from my relationship to the concept of crip, not to
claim one form of identification is more positive or useful than the
other. In fact, disidentification and identifying with have important
areas of overlap and intersection.]{.underline}

[Crip is a term many people within disability studies and activist
communities use not only in reference to people with disabilities, but
also to the intellectual and art culture arising from such
communitie]{.underline}s. C[rip is shorthand for the word \"cripple\"
which has been (and is) used as an insult toward people with
disabilities, but which has been re-appropriated as an intra-group term
of empowerment and solidarity. Thus, crip \"is a term which has much
currency in disability activism and culture but still might seem harsh
to those outside those communities\"]{.underline} (Kafer, 2013, p. 15).
An [early proponent of crip\'s social and political potential, Carrie
Sandahl (2003) describes crip as a \"fluid and ever-changing\" term
which \"expanded to include not only those with physical impairments but
those with sensory or mental impairments as well\"]{.underline} (p. 27).
In a [footnote to her use of the term, Sandahl recognizes the
still-developing state of disability studies and writes: \"If I had my
druthers, I would replace the term disability studies with crip theory
or crip studies to represent its radical edge\"]{.underline} (p. 53;
original emphasis).

[Robert McRuer (2006), however, proposes that [**crip theory is not a
one-to-one replacement for disability studies**,]{.mark} but rather,
crip theory has \"a similar contestatory relationship to disability
studies and identity that queer theory has to LGBT studies and identity,
\[although\] **[crip theory does not---perhaps paradoxically---seek to
dematerialize disability identity]{.mark}\" (**]{.underline}p. 35).
T[his move away from the postmodern dematerialization of identity
positions is a key connection between crip theory and queer of color
critique by scholars such as Cathy Cohen (2005), Lawrence La
Fountain-Stokes (2009), and others who have actively resisted such
moves, insisting that to move entirely away from identity and identity
politics is not a viable option for those who are multiply marginalized
and who need such identity positions for survival and collective
action]{.underline}. As Roderick [Ferguson (2004) writes, queer of color
critique rethinks categories, but does not discard them. Related to
Ferguson\'s rethinking of categories, Alison Kafer (2013) argues that
crip theory expands and enriches disability studies by departing from
the social model\'s assumption that \"disabled\" and \"nondisabled\" are
discrete, self-evident categories, choosing instead to explore the
creation of such categories and the moments in which they \"fail to
hold\" (p. 10).]{.underline}

[Sandahl, McRuer and Kafer all emphasize the relationship of crip and
queer. Sandahl (2003) insists that like queer**, crip is not only a noun
and adjective, but also a verb**: to \"crip\" means to spin \"mainstream
representations or practices to reveal able-bodied assumptions and
exclusionary effects \[...to\] expose the arbitrary delineation between
normal and defective and the negative social ramifications of attempts
to homogenize humanity\" (p. 37).]{.underline} Crip as verb can
therefore be understood as a specific form of disidentification. Making
further connections between crip and queer, Sandahl writes:

As a pejorative, the term queer was originally targeted at gays and
lesbians, yet its rearticulation as a term of pride is currently claimed
by those who may not consider themselves homosexual, such as the
transgendered, transsexuals, heterosexual sex radicals, and others.
\[...Although\] I have never heard a nondisabled person seriously claim
to be crip (as heterosexuals have claimed to be queer), I would not be
surprised by this practice. The fluidity of both terms makes it likely
that their boundaries will dissolve (p. 27).

This specific aspect of the relationship between queer and crip, the
possibility of these terms referring to or being claimed by people not
previously referenced by them, is critical to the current direction of
crip theory and to my own identification with the term. Kafer (2013)
writes that crip, or crip affiliation, could include both \"those who
lack a \'proper\' (read: medically acceptable, doctor-provided, and
insurer-approved) diagnosis for their symptoms\" and, more complexly,
\"people identifying with disability and lacking not only a diagnosis
but any \'symptoms\' of impairment\" (p. 12-13). In a related vein,
McRuer (2006) writes that although one must be \"attuned to the dangers
of appropriation,\" it is both theoretically and politically \"important
to raise issues about what it means, for the purposes of solidarity, to
come out as something you are---at least in some ways---not\" (p. 37).

I align myself with McRuer\'s \"coming out crip\" and Kafer\'s \"crip
affiliation\" by claiming crip and declaring myself a crip-identified,
fat, black, queer woman. Kafer writes:

[Claiming crip can be a way of acknowledging that we all have bodies and
minds with shifting abilities, and that such shifts have political and
social meanings and histories. It can be a way of imagining multiple
futures, claiming crip as a desired and desirable location, regardless
of one\'s own embodiment or mental/psychological processes... thinking
through what nondisabled claims to crip might entail will require
exploring whether such claims might be more available, more imaginable,
to some people than others (and on what basis) (pp. 13).]{.underline}

[I argue that my particular relationship to racial, gender, and
sexuality systems of oppression and privilege is what makes claiming
crip available to me]{.underline}. [The ways in which my fat, black,
queer, woman\'s body/mind/desire/behavior is constantly read and reacted
to as non-normative, sometimes excessively so, makes me feel
particularly akin to those who identify as disabled and/or crip, people
whose bodies/minds/desires/behaviors are also outside the social
norm.]{.underline} In this way, I argue that I am similarly situated in
regard to many vectors of power as people with disabilities and that
interrogation into the processes which have so situated us are needed in
order to develop coalitional theory and politial solidarity.

[It is important to emphasize that I am calling myself crip-identified,
meaning that I identify with not as crip,]{.underline} a distinction
McRuer (2006) suggests in his work, but does not make sufficiently
clear[. I use [identify with to mean having acknowledged and prioritized
political and personal connections to a group with which one does not
identify as a member.]{.mark} To [identify with means to feel implicated
by the culture and politics of another group and seek to better
understand this link]{.mark}. While to identify with could be understood
as analogous to being an ally,]{.underline} [I contend that there is
something more personal, sustained, and affective about it.]{.underline}
[Identifying with is a careful, conscious joining---a standing/sitting
among rather than by or behind a group---which seeks to reduce
separation while acknowledging differences in privileges and
oppression]{.underline}. I [connect identifying with to Cathy Cohen\'s
(2005) call for a radical politics of shared resistance built on
identities as they are impacted by and invested with different degrees
of normative power]{.underline}. Identifying with is particularly
important in the case of disability which, as many have noted, is the
only identity category which one can join at any moment without intent.
I [use crip-identified as something different than disability ally
because it is an almost-not-quite-yet identification. I am
crip-identified not only because my body/mind/desire/behavior is
non-normative in terms of race, gender, sexuality, and size, but also
because of its precarious relationship to disability as this term is
currently culturally understood.]{.underline}

I [want to be clear that I am aware of my ability
privileges]{.underline} and I know, as McRuer (2006) insists, that I
cannot make such privileges \"magically disappear\" by simply refusing
them because \"the [benefits that accrue to nondisabled people in that
\[ability/disability\] system are bigger than any individual\'s
seemingly voluntary refusal of them]{.underline}\" (p. 36). With this
recognition of privilege in mind, I contend that fatness represents an
important form of embodiment which needs further engagement within the
field of disability studies. Fatness is one of the primary avenues
through which I identify with crip and therefore I want to discuss a few
of the connections between fatness and disability here to further
illustrate how I have come to claim crip.

### 2AC \-\-- Liberalism 

**Even if political liberalism currently excludes the disabled,
discussing questions of implementation can revise it**

**Badano 13** (Gabriele -- PhD candidate at the Centre for Philosophy,
Justice and Health at University College London -- "Political liberalism
and the justice claims of the disabled: a reconciliation," Critical
Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, April 2013,
http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/tHKkbrxhGYIWAxTcJrAW/full#.UxyV-PldX-4)

I argue that any proposal [[abandoning the language of political justice
would not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[do enough for]{.mark} those
[individuals with disabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} who fall outside the
basic idea of persons as depicted by Rawls. In fact, the intuitions
supporting [the idea that concepts like rights and opportunities are
indispensable are very strong.]{.underline}11 Let us go back to the
examples of individuals falling outside Rawls's idea of persons because
their disabilities prevent them from being a net beneﬁt to social
cooperation. [They are [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} who need
multiple carers to work, or [[whose disabilities prevent them from
providing a beneﬁt to social cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
large enough. To put the point more sharply, it is worth noticing that
the disabilities in question are compatible with being in full
possession of one's logical and moral powers. Now, **[[should we
accept]{.mark} that [those individuals ought to be given no
rights]{.mark} or opportunities?]{.underline}** An afﬁrmative answer
would strike us as implausible, and for a good reason. In [a liberal
society, having one's rights, opportunities and]{.underline} basic
distributive [entitlements acknowledged is one and the same as being
recognized as an equal.]{.underline} And what is missing from Rawls's
political liberalism is precisely the idea that falling below a
threshold of full cooperation should not be enough to prevent the
disabled from being regarded as persons on an equal footing with anyone
else. In sum, [Rawls's political liberalism is not amenable to any
extension that,]{.underline} keeping the basic ideas of society and
persons intact, [is able to include a concern with the status of
individuals with disabilities.]{.underline} In addition, the proposal
that the interests of the disabled are not for public reason to protect
is not satisfactory. [Consequently, a]{.underline} substantial
**[[revision is the only way to reconcile political liberalism
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** our intuitions concerning **[[what is due to
the disabled]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 5. Revising political liberalism I:
beyond Hartley's contractualism The aim of this section and the next is
to propose a substantial revision of Rawls's theory that accommodates
the justice claims of the disabled while upholding the project of
political liberalism. [A question that needs to be answered]{.underline}
at this point [is: **why should we uphold**]{.underline} the project of
[**political liberalism, rather than endorsing a different model** that
more neatly ﬁts with our]{.underline} intuitions concerning [what is due
to the disabled**?**]{.underline} First, the general project of
[[political liberalism is compelling]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rawls's
political liberalism aims to identify a common ground of political ideas
that can work as the basis on which the most important political
decisions should be made. [This project is of the greatest importance
because]{.underline}, if successful, [[it creates legitimacy by building
institutions on the basis of concepts]{.mark} that are [acceptable to
each]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonable [[individual]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, it promotes stability in societies that are characterized by
deep pluralism. Second, [[despite Rawls's failure to take]{.mark} the
interests of [the disabled into consideration,]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[political liberalism is well suited to support the justice claims of
individuals with disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is because
[the idea that the disabled are citizens who deserve our respect is part
of the common culture]{.underline} of our societies. In other words,
there is an overlapping consensus on the idea that rights, opportunities
and distributive shares must be granted to individuals who are not fully
cooperating members of society, including those who fall below full
moral powers. It is widely believed that [[those with]{.mark} physical
[disabilities should have the same rights as]{.mark} their [fellow
citizens, live in a social environment that does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} excessively [[limit their opportunities and
receive beneﬁts that]{.mark} help [meet their]{.mark}]{.underline}
special [[needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Besides, although the state or
third parties are given exceptional rights to interfere with the
autonomy of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities, [it is
widely recognized that the mentally disabled are citizens whose basic
interests must be protected by the law.]{.underline}12 In the public
space, any proposal that individuals who are not fully cooperating
members of society should have their basic interests neglected would be
widely received with outrage. Such proposal would be said to ﬁt a
fascist society, not a decent one. Among other legal documents, the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN
General Assembly, A/61/611) can be taken as the epitome of this
widespread attitude. Adopted in 2006, the Convention requires that all
individuals with disabilities should share in the enjoyment of equal
fundamental rights.

**Abstract critique keeps us from forefronting political reform**

[Disability rights enjoy a seemingly ironclad moral
consensus]{.underline}, an ostensible unanimity that is striking given
America's entrenched polarization and the antagonism surrounding other
identity movements. Many are wary of L.G.B.T. rights or the Black Lives
Matter movement, but it seems beyond the pale --- almost cruel --- to
oppose disability rights. Nobody wants to be anti-disability. Initially,
this harmony would seem helpful. [Free from partisan discord,
advancements]{.underline} for the approximately 57 million Americans
with disabilities [should be easier to achieve]{.underline}, borne aloft
by the wings of certain progress. [Why, then, do rampant unemployment
and educational disparities endure, and why does success remain the
exception?]{.underline} I think part of the reason is the insulation of
[our [pro-disabled political consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its logic
[[is]{.mark} [rooted]{.mark}]{.underline} not in any deep belief in the
equal worth of citizens with disabilities, but rather [[in a general
aversion to disability]{.mark}. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} is related to
the charity impulse that has always surrounded disability --- and [[has
constrained liberation efforts by]{.mark} [assuming]{.mark} that
[inequities]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline} unfortunate but [[natural
realities]{.mark} to be mitigated through compassion, [**rather than
politically structured injustices**. There is]{.mark} also [a]{.mark}
profound [lack of disabled people in the public sphere]{.mark},
meaning]{.underline} any [substantive discussion]{.underline} that does
occur [is extremely rare.]{.underline} I suspect many people I talk to
about disability maintain an implicit hope that, if they nod as
vigorously as possible, the issue will simply go away. In this way,
support for [[disability rights]{.underline}]{.mark} is similar to the
act of expressing perfunctory thanks to military veterans. It
temporarily [[absolves us of]{.mark} the [responsibility]{.mark} to
address the heart of the matter.]{.underline} Moreover, the apparent
moral consensus may be mostly superficial. In trying to enact
accessibility, disability advocates encounter increasing resistance as
the effort and costs involved in proposals come closer to being
realized. (Consider the neighborhood store that decides it's just too
costly to install a ramp, or the community lecture that excludes deaf
attendees by refusing to hire a sign-language interpreter.) Instead of
facilitating change, false unity actually restrains change. It stifles
the more substantive conversations true progress requires. And our
inability to speak honestly --- and contentiously --- about disability
shows how the politics of disability is in this sense non-political. We
are the worse for it. [In addition to greater participation in the
public sphere, true progress for citizens with disabilities will require
a willingness to confront the issues head-on]{.underline}, even when ---
especially when --- citizens disagree on competing solutions. **[[We
must politicize disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- not in the
cable-news, grandstanding kind of way, but in the term's more formal
sense. The work of the Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe can
help illuminate what's at stake. Mouffe begins with the premise that
human relations are inherently antagonistic: Political change always
requires controversial transfers in power or prestige, and it is an
illusion to imagine politics without confrontation. Per this "agonistic"
conception of democracy, a healthy political order is one that prefers
vigorous, good-faith argumentation to complacent consensus. Until we
publicly recognize real disagreements surrounding disability and
accessibility, Mouffe would insist, we are doomed to a vacuous, empty
debate that is neither political nor productive. Recall the Kovaleski
incident. I'm not suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump's actions
is open to legitimate questioning. But [in their forcefully reassuring
comments and messages, my friends prevented any serious discussion of
disability at the level where reasonable disagreement does exist. Where
will the money come from to fund disability employment schemes? **[How
do we even define "disability"?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Despite --- and,
I would argue, partly [[because of]{.mark} --- the [broad
condemnation]{.mark}]{.underline} of Mr. Trump for his insensitivity,
[[there was no substantive public discussion]{.mark} of such
issues.]{.underline} You may be thinking, haven't we had enough politics
lately? Maybe it's a blessing that disability isn't as political as it
might be; it avoids the drama and messiness that now seem to define our
common life. Avoiding politics might be possible if
[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark} were an exclusively private affair.
But it [[is]{.mark} fundamentally [a public
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, affecting everyone directly or indirectly
and revealing our obligations to one another as members of a democratic
society. [Issues of accessibility can be fully addressed only through
public institutions and collective effort. For the disability community,
there is no answer but politics.]{.underline} But [politics need not be
repulsive.]{.underline} That's the beauty of Mouffe's agonism: [By
legitimating clashing arguments and welcoming them into the political
fold, unproductive antagonism becomes constructive]{.underline}, and
compromises emerge.

### 2AC \-\-- Perm 

**Perm solves -- challenging ableist assumptions must be coupled with
evaluative judgement**

**Vehmas & Watson 13** (Simo Vehmas & Nick Watson, "Moral wrongs,
disadvantages, and disability: a critique of critical disability
studies", p. 642-643)

\*CDS = Critical Disability Studies

[CDS does not engage with ethical issues to do with the role of
impairment and disability in people's well-being and the pragmatic and
mundane issues of day-today living.]{.underline} Imagine,
[for]{.underline} example, a pregnant woman who has agreed, possibly
with very little thought, to the routine of prenatal diagnostics, and
who has been informed that [the fetus]{.underline} she is
[carrying]{.underline} has [Tay-Sachs disease.]{.underline} She now has
to make the decision over [whether to terminate the
pregnancy]{.underline} or carry it to term. The value judgements that
surround Tay-Sachs include the fact that it will cause pain and
suffering to the child and he or she will probably die before the age of
four. These [are morally relevant considerations to the mother. Whilst
CDS would probably guide her to confront ableist assumptions and
challenge her beliefs about the condition, **[considerations]{.mark}
having [to do with]{.mark} pain and [suffering are]{.mark} nevertheless
[morally significant]{.mark}.** The way people see things, and the
language that is used to describe certain conditions, can affect how
they react to them, but [freeing oneself from ableist assumptions **may
not in some cases be enough.**]{.mark} There may be insurmountable
realities attached to some impairments]{.underline} where parents feel
that their personal and social circumstances would not enable them to
provide the child or themselves with a satisfactory life (Vehmas 2003).
Impairment sometimes produces practical, difficult ethical choices and
[[we need more concrete viewpoints]{.mark} than the ideas provided
through ableism, which offers very little practical moral
guidance.]{.underline} It is questionable whether the notion of ableism
would help the parents in deciding whether to have a child who has a
degenerative condition that results in early death. Campbell (2009a, 39,
149 and 159), for example, discusses arguments about impairments as
harmful conditions, the ethics of external bodily transplants as well as
wrongful birth and life court cases (whether life with an impairment is
preferable to non-existence), and how ableism impacts on discourse
around these issues. Whilst her analysis of such ableist discourses
suggests ethical judgements, she provides no arguments or conclusions as
to whether, for example, external bodily transplants are ethically wrong
or whether impairment may or may not constitute a moral harm. Under the
anti-dualistic stance adopted by CDS, even [the well-being/ill-being
dualism becomes an arbitrary]{.underline} and nonsensical
[construct]{.underline}. Under ableism it can be constructed as merely
maintaining the dominance of those seemingly faring well (supposedly,
'non-disabled' people), and labels those faring less well as having
lesser value. [[There may not be a clear answer to what]{.mark}
[constitutes]{.mark} human [well-being]{.mark}]{.underline} or
flourishing, [[but in general we can]{.mark} and we need to [agree about
some necessary elements]{.mark}]{.underline} required for well-being.
Also, as moral agents [we have an obligation to make judgements about
people's well-being and act in ways that their well-being is
enhanced]{.underline} (Eshleman 2009). This is why [we
have]{.underline}, for example, [coronary heart disease prevention
programmes because the possible death or associated health problems are
seen as harms]{.underline}. Possibly these policies are based on ableist
perspective, but if that is the case then the normative use of ableism
is null; eradicating supposedly ableist enterprises such as coronary
heart disease prevention would be an example of reductio ad absurdum.
Denying some aspects of well-being are so clear that their denial would
be absurd, and simply morally wrong. [[CDS]{.mark} raises ethical issues
and insinuates normative judgements but [does not provide supporting
ethical arguments. This is]{.mark} a way of [shirking from]{.mark}
intellectual and ethical [responsibility to provide]{.mark}]{.underline}
[sound arguments and [conceptual tools for ethical
decision-making]{.mark} that would benefit disabled people.]{.underline}
If we are to describe disability, disablism, and oppression properly, we
have to explicate the moral and political wrong related to these
phenomena. [Whilst [CDS]{.mark} has produced useful
analyses]{.underline}, for example, of the cultural reproduction of
disability, [**it [needs to engage more closely with the evaluative
issues]{.mark}** inherently related to disability.]{.underline} As Sayer
has argued (against Foucault): while one could hardly disagree that we
should seek to uncover the hidden and unconsidered ideas on which
practices are based, I would argue that critique is indeed exactly about
identifying what things 'are not right as they are', and why. (Sayer
2011, 244)

### 2AC \-\-- State Good 

#### State action can be good for people with disabilities -- ADA proves 

**Mckeever 20** (Amy Mckeever, JULY 30, 2020, \"How the Americans with
Disabilities Act transformed a country,\" History,
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/americans-disabilities-act-transformed-united-states>
) //RB

[More than 2,000 disability rights advocates gathered on the South Lawn
of the White House in Washington, D.C., on a hot summer day. It was July
26, 1990, and they'd come together to witness one of the most momentous
civil rights victories in decades: President George H.W. Bush signing
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law.]{.underline}

During the signing ceremony---days after the Fourth of July---[Bush
admitted that the United States hadn't always lived up to its founding
principles of freedom and equality. "\[T\]ragically, for too many
Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied,"
he said. "Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no
Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."]{.underline}

**[[The ADA not only provided comprehensive civil rights protections for
people with disabilities for the first time in the nation's
history]{.mark}, but it also [marked a sea change in the nation's
attitudes toward disability rights]{.mark}. Here's how the landmark
statute came to be, and how it transformed the country.]{.underline}**

The disability rights movement gains steam

Throughout history, people with disabilities were feared and ridiculed
for their perceived defects and pushed to the margins of society. By the
1960s, that discrimination had been codified. People with disabilities
were excluded from public schools, involuntarily sterilized, sent to
live in state-run institutions, and even denied the right to vote. Some
U.S. municipalities even had so-called "ugly laws" prohibiting people
with "unsightly or disgusting" deformities in public places. It was a
world designed not to include people with disabilities. Government
buildings and private businesses alike lacked ramps and elevators, while
public transportation rarely provided accommodations for people with
mobility or visual impairments. Having a disability was considered a
medical problem to be solved rather than an identity to be protected
under non-discrimination laws. But things began to change in the 1970s.
Inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, disability rights
advocates became more vocal in their demands that their rights ought to
be guaranteed as well. Disability had also become more noticeable as
wars in Vietnam and Korea returned thousands of soldiers with lasting
injuries. In 1973, advocates won the passage of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibited programs receiving federal funding
from discriminating against people with disabilities. It was the first
piece of legislation to use the term "discrimination" to describe the
limitations that these Americans face.

[For the law to go into effect, the government would have to issue
regulations defining who qualifies as a person with a disability and
what constitutes discrimination in the disability context]{.underline}.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare put off issuing those
regulations for four years as they wrestled over the terms. Impatient
with the delay---and worried it meant the regulations would be
weakened---advocates organized protests around the country. [In April
1977 they launched a sit-in at a federal building in San Francisco that
would last for 28 days---the longest peaceful occupation of a federal
building in U.S. history---and **result in victory**.]{.underline}

The need for a comprehensive civil rights law

[With Section 504, the American public began to understand that making
accommodations for people with disabilities was a civil right rather
than a welfare benefit.]{.underline} It also galvanized a growing
disability rights movement that won several other important victories in
the 1970s and 1980s---including legislation that guaranteed a free
public education to children with impairments and prohibited housing
discrimination on the basis of disabilities. Yet discrimination
persisted. In 1979, the Supreme Court ruled that the nursing school at
Southeastern Community College in Whiteville, North Carolina, was not
required by Section 504 to accommodate a hearing-impaired applicant. In
other circumstances, regulations were simply not well enforced. For
example, transit authorities were left to decide for themselves how
accessible they needed to be. (A skull discovered in Spain suggests that
early humans cared for disabled children.) In the mid-1980s, advocates
came to the conclusion that the critical next step was to push for
comprehensive civil rights legislation for people with disabilities. The
National Council on Disability commissioned a report on the need for
such a law, while its vice chair Justin Dart---who would later become
known as the "Godfather of the ADA"---embarked on a national tour to
discuss disability policy with local officials and gather stories of the
discrimination people with disabilities faced. These advocacy efforts
made an impression on both sides of the political aisle. Disability
rights had become a bipartisan issue thanks to years of changing public
perceptions. In 1988, Senators Lowell Weicker, a Republican from
Connecticut, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, introduced the
Americans with Disabilities Act. After years of revisions, amendments,
and negotiations, the bill was passed, and on that July day Bush---who
had made civil rights legislation for people with disabilities a
campaign promise in 1988---signed it into law with Dart by his side.

[Why the [ADA]{.mark} matters]{.underline}

[The Americans with Disabilities Act was a [sweeping piece of
legislation]{.mark} that [banned]{.mark} [discrimination]{.mark} on the
[basis]{.mark} of [disability]{.mark} in employment, public
accommodations, public services, transportation, and
telecommunication]{.underline}. It finally afforded people with
disabilities the same protections that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had
provided on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin.

\"**[It [is the world's first declaration of equality for people with
disabilities]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** [Dart wrote after the ADA was
passed. \"[It will proclaim to America and to the world that people with
disabilities are fully human;]{.mark} that paternalistic,
discriminatory, segregationist attitudes are no longer acceptable; and
that henceforth people with disabilities must be accorded the same
personal respect and the same social and economic opportunities as other
people.\"]{.underline}

[The [ADA]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} the process of [building a more
accessible world by ensuring that buildings, schools, and public spaces
were equipped with ramps, elevators, and curb cuts.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It [made travel easier by requiring operators to make accommodations,
such as offering wheelchair lifts, airport shuttle service, and rental
cars with hand controls. It also led to the rise of interpreters and
closed captioning in public communications. (These five coastal areas
have made accessibility a priority.)]{.underline}

[Crucially, this [legislation has also become a model for lawmakers and
activists]{.mark} around the world seeking [to end
discrimination]{.mark} against people with disabilities in their
countries. Since 2000, more than 180 countries have passed legislation
inspired by the ADA.]{.underline} The law is limited, however. The ADA
has been criticized for failing to increase employment among people with
disabilities---only 19 percent are in the workforce today compared with
66 percent of those without disabilities. People with disabilities are
still disenfranchised. Accommodations at polling places across the
nation are inadequate; in 2016, a government report found that 60
percent of the polling places it examined had one or more potential
impediments, such as ramps that were dangerously steep or paths in poor
condition. Meanwhile, 39 states and Washington, D.C., have incompetence
laws that allow judges to strip the vote from people they deem incapable
of participating in the democratic process, such as people with mental
impairments. Stigma and discrimination persist throughout society too.
The ADA may not be perfect, but as Dart wrote in 1990, it "is only the
beginning. It is not a solution. Rather, it is an essential foundation
on which solutions will be constructed."

[The [long-term consequences of protracted confl ict on disabled people
and the creation of impairment need more research.]{.mark} This calls
for a longitudinal or life-course approach (Priestley 2007 ) to see how
identities, single and multiple impairment(s), health and social care
needs differ as the age of populations and their environments
change]{.underline}. A life-course approach can also [explore how the
concept of disability is changing intergenerationally]{.underline},
whether passed on biologically (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and socially (e.g.
stigma), or through ascription of a new kinship identity (e.g. amputee)
(Berghs 2012 ). Yet, [research, funding and planning to understand the
long-term effects of confl ict on disability is rarely
available]{.underline} (Wehbi 2011a ). Inhorn and Kobeissi ( 2006 )
usefully note how there are six long-term effects of confl ict on
civilians: physical, mental, reproductive/demographic, social
structural, infrastructural, and environmental. We briefl y discuss each
of these in turn in an effort to illustrate what is missing from current
debates in relation to disability.

Physical [We know very little about civilian deaths and creation of
impairment despite the fact that poorly resourced health systems
contribute to death, illness and impairment]{.underline} (Banatvala and
Zwi 2000 ; WHO 2011 ). With the focus on public health, the effects of
malnutrition, communicable and non-communicable diseases, unsanitary
conditions and lack of access to water are given substantial attention
post-confl ict. For example, Miles and Medi ( 1994 ) [found that while
[confl ict in Mozambique had resulted in impairment among
children]{.mark}, most actually gained indirect impairments due to a mix
of effects created by the [long]{.mark}-[term consequences of the confl
ict]{.mark}, such as malnutrition. Insurance provision, necessary
implementation of user fees for services and a lack of (paid)
professionals, medication, assistive devices, prosthetics and
rehabilitation programmes affect impairment, too]{.underline}. Growing
privatisation under neo-liberalism is also a threat to access to health
and social care services (Berghs 2013 ). Likewise, the impact of
landmines, chemicals and circulation of (small) arms can last for
generations and will need long-term planning of services. Long-term
effects of confl ict and links to impairment need to be identifi ed so
that services can be planned and implemented adequately .

[Mental In post-confl ict situations, there are [increases in mental
health]{.mark} needs such as for counselling, social care and
[specialised psychiatric services]{.mark}.]{.underline} Inhorn and
Kobeissi ( 2006 ) cite lack of infrastructural development and trained
professionals, as well as not prioritising mental health as detrimental
to well-bein[g. The evidence base for many [interventions affecting
disabled people does not exist,]{.mark} especially in the fi eld of
gender-based violence and mental health]{.underline} (Blanchet et al.
2013 ). Likewise, while there is a lot of data on western veterans,
[there is very little information on culturally sensitive, indigenous or
communal interventions for disabled people. Institutionalisation,
stigma, western diagnoses (following the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5) and links to pharmaceutical companies also
infl uence how mental health care is accessed and why.]{.underline}
Thus, coping strategies involving cheap and freely available
pharmaceuticals, alcohol and/or drugs develop in society (Inhorn and
Kobeissi 2006 ). More research is needed to explore the longterm mental
health impact of conflict.

Reproductive/Demographic [[Lives are disrupted during a confl
ict]{.mark}, as families, gender relations and patterns of reproduction
undergo profound changes.]{.underline} M[arriage is a means of societal
integration for disabled people but when most men are fi ghting or
community ties are disrupted, there may be earlier, delayed or no
marriages taking place. [Periods of confl ict also have reproductive
consequences for disabled women and men with lack of access to
reproductive services, antenatal, postnatal and emergency]{.mark}
care]{.underline}. There may also be an increase in perceived need for
certain services or technologies to prevent impairment, such as
antenatal screening in Vietnam (Gammeltoft 2013 ). Correlations exist
between lack of access to reproductive services (e.g. screening and
contraception) and war-time sexual violence, increases in Sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) , infertility, infant deaths and children
born with impairments. Disabled people often face discrimination in
services and institutions ensuring neglect, segregation, sterilisation
or institutionalisation. For example, Human Rights Watch ( 2010 )
documented high rates of physical and sexual abuse of disabled women
post-confl ict, but a lack of access to reproductive services, health
education and STI testing continues. Lack of access to reproductive
services pre- and post-confl ict is important to understand
demographically.

Social Structural [The [social structure of society changes during a
confl ict]{.mark} and the informal CBR systems that families and
communities are supplied with may collapse. [Programmes implemented by
NGOs that superfi cially mainstream disability may also **increase
poverty and marginalisation of disabled people**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Wehbi 2011a ). [There could be [rising violence on account of
(small) arms and the circulation of drugs]{.mark}, often with links to
criminal networks and gangs, which leads to rises in specifi c types of
impairment (e.g. spinal cord injuries caused by bullet
wounds)]{.underline} (Buchanan 2011 ; Handicap International \[HI\] 2012
). [Confl ict and post-confl ict societal upheaval may last for decades
with the threat of bombs, drones and violence profoundly affecting
communities.]{.underline} Hill and Hansen ( 2011 ) describe how in
[Northern Ireland, a state of terror with bombs going off meant that
those with mobility problems were forced to stay at home, leading to
greater social isolation. Social isolation has also been identifi ed as
a risk factor when it comes to exploitation of disabled
people]{.underline} (Grove et al. 2010 ). The consequences of societal
breakdown, lack of evaluation of disability programming during a confl
ict and post-confl ict, and the programmes that empower disabled people
to survive must be urgently addressed.

[[Infrastructural Confl ict destroys most of the limited infrastructure
that exists for disabled people.]{.mark} Vocational workshops,
institutions such as day centres, and schools need to be
rebuilt.]{.underline} [Post-confl ict rebuilding can offer an
opportunity for inclusive design and mainstreaming of disability in all
infrastructural development.]{.underline} For instance, while education
is disrupted, new opportunities present themselves to rebuild
educational and vocational systems through inclusive practices (Miles
2013 ). Such interventions will have little impact, however, if issues
in the current educational system, notably that teachers lack training
and know-how and are often unpaid, are neglected. Likewise, ensuring
suitable skills training, micro-credit programmes, and employment in the
formal and informal economy are particular concerns post-confl ict, but
there will be gross diffi - culties in improving disabled people's
situation if societal attitudes remain negative, barriers persist in
transportation systems, or there is no economy to contribute to.
Therefore, we need to understand more about what enables the entire
social and physical infrastructure to become inclusive and robust
post-confl ict.

Environmental The [exploitation of resources and environmental impact of
confl icts will be felt for generations. Yet, the impact of new forms of
impairment on indigenous communities and women is rarely investigated
(Ngo et al. 2012 ). Likewise, disability rights and intergenerational
rights in terms of creation of differing forms of impairment are rarely
advocated (Soldatic 2013 ). No]{.underline}rth--South hierarchies in
bodies and body parts are thus still correlated with inequalities,
especially in countries with histories of violence or confl ict that are
undergoing political transitions (see Scheper-Hughes 1996 ). T[his is
exemplifi ed in [biopolitical claims for genetic reproductive harm, such
as the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, nuclear testing in the southern
hemisphere and the use of depleted uranium in Iraq]{.mark}, which are
rarely upheld. Refl ections on newer forms of biosociality, or social
identities based on biological, genetic or medical conditions (such as
HIV/AIDs), chemical and environmental harm, and the links between confl
ict, violence and activism remain unexplored.]{.underline}

Critical disability studies and justice

The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that disability
is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new ideas on
disability. In particular, this has enabled the development of a theory
that can take account of not only impairment effects but also can
include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or cultural identities. It
has also argued for the re-emergence of a new political identity, one
where a solidarity that was previously built on a common single identity
is replaced by one that incorporates multiple voices including
representatives from across the range of constituencies. The politics
that it seeks to develop will be the ending of the single interest group
identity of the disability movement to be replaced by single-issue
groups campaigning for different social issues. To paraphrase Lister
(1998, 74), [[if disability and impairment are simply]{.mark} to be
'[deconstructed]{.mark} into a kaleidoscope of shifting identities' and
ableist discourses, **[there will be no disabled people left to]{.mark}
either [fight for the right to be]{.mark}, or to be [a
citizen.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If the principles of CDS are evaluated
critically in the light of disadvantage, its analytical and political
value becomes questionable. Its relativism and its suggestions that
impairments are ethically and politically merely neutral differences are
false. [Impairments often have very tangible effects on people's
well-being]{.underline}, many of [which cannot be explained away by
deconstruction]{.underline} (for example, Shakespeare 2006; Thomas
1999). [[Recognizing impairment]{.mark} effects [is necessary]{.mark} in
order [to secure proper treatment and social arrangements]{.mark} that
enhance disabled people's well-being and social participation. CDS runs
the risk of dismissing]{.underline} not only the personal experiences of
living with impairment, but also [the significance of the differences
between socially created disadvantages.]{.underline} These
[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark} that [often [result from
oppressive]{.mark} [social arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, are very
much real and take place in different ways for different disadvantaged
groups. [[Disabled people]{.mark} typically [experience disadvantage in
relation to the market]{.mark} and capitalism]{.underline}, and [[they
have to]{.mark} a large extent [been excluded]{.mark} [from
employment]{.mark} and from equal social participation]{.underline},
respect and wealth (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 26). On top of these
materialist disadvantages, disabled people are stigmatized as deviant
and undesirable, and also subordinated to various oppressive
hierarchical relations. [For [disabled people]{.mark} to achieve
participatory parity, they require more than recognition; **[they need
material help]{.mark}, targeted resource enhancement, and personal
enhancement**]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is
rooted in the economic structures of society and demands redistribution
of goods and wealth.]{.underline} In contrast to some other oppressed
groups, disabled people require more than the removal of barriers if
they are to achieve social justice. This extra help might be small --
for example, allowing a student with dyslexia extra time in an
examination -- through to complex interventions such as facilitated
communication, a job support worker or 24-hour personal assistance.
Whatever the size, it is an extra cost both to employers and to the
state. These are real needs and represent real differences. Without an
acceptance of these differences it is hard to see how we could move
forward. Whilst these 'real differences' can be presented as the result
of dominant ableist discourses where disabled people's needs are
regarded as extra cost, this does not solve the problem. [The problems
[disabled people]{.mark} face [require **more than ideological
change**]{.mark}, and ideological change is of little use if it does not
result in material change. [CDS **fails to account for the economic
basis of disability**]{.mark} and offers only the tools of
deconstruction and the abolishment of cultural hierarchies to eradicate
economic injustice. This]{.underline}, as Fraser (2000) has argued,
[would be possible in a society where there were no relatively
autonomous markets and the distribution of goods were regulated through
cultural values.]{.underline} In such a society, oppression based on
identity would translate perfectly into economic injustice and
maldistribution. [This is far from the current reality where
'marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree]{.underline},
at least partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from
cultural patterns of value and prestige' (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets are
not controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result they
generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of identity
hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). The disadvantage related to
disability is to a great extent a matter of economic injustice, and
[before this injustice can be corrected we have to be able to identify
those individuals and social groups that have been disadvantaged by
social arrangements. Whilst this does create and foster categories and
binaries between groups of people, it also requires some sort of
categories to start with; namely, the various categories of
disadvantage.]{.underline} Both the social and physical mechanisms that
produce human diversity are real, and they produce tangible differences
that cannot be challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out
the wanton nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings
attached to disability. Changing the social conditions that disadvantage
and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes dualistic,
reality of social advantage and disadvantage between different groups of
people is recognized. This is exactly why group identities based on, for
example, impairment, gender, or sexuality have been invaluable tools in
the resistance against discrimination and oppression -- in the fight
against socially produced disadvantage. [[Confident]{.mark}, positive
[disability identity has enabled]{.mark} many disabled [people
to]{.mark} actively challenge the status quo that disadvantages them and
to [claim rights and]{.mark} power and [participation in]{.mark}
dominant [institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Being different from the
so-called normal majority is no longer considered to conflict with a
good life, equality and respect. Quite the opposite, [positive
realization of one's difference has been liberating and empowering to
many disabled people]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006; Morris 1991). For a
radical and active disability movement to emerge and for disabled people
to take action on their own account, they have to see themselves as an
unfairly marginalized or disadvantaged constituency and a minority group
(Shakespeare and Watson 2001). [[The category disabled/ non-disabled is
a good abstraction that can **enable**]{.mark} **the development of
[communities of resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and without it is
hard to see how these could develop. CDS is premised on the idea that
difference acts as a precursor to the normalizing of behaviour and a
requirement to treat people differently and, importantly, less
favourably. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the
categories that are applied to disabled people create an unnecessary
divide between disabled and nondisabled people. You could equally make
the point that [[without]{.mark} these [categories we would not
know]{.mark} what it is we have to do, [what actions]{.mark} we have to
take [or what services]{.mark} we have to put in place to include
disabled people.]{.underline} Indeed, [for many disabled people the
disadvantages they are subjected to arise not as the result of
domination but through neglect and the denial of services and through
society failing to take responsibility for those in need.]{.underline}
As Wolff (2009, 114) points out: 'anti-discrimination policy needs to
identify a group to be protected.' In other words, [it is impossible to
fight the oppression of a group of people that does not
exist.]{.underline} Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding
legislation and policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination. [The point of anti-discrimination legislation is to
protect people from discrimination on the basis of their physical and
mental properties, not on their opportunity to achieve equal
participation and respect.]{.underline} Thus, 'the parallel to race and
gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff 2009, 135).

### 2AC \-\-- Alt Fails Mindset

**Alt can't change society's worldview and only marginalizes material
experiences**

**Vehmas & Watson 13** (Simo Vehmas & Nick Watson, "Moral wrongs,
disadvantages, and disability: a critique of critical disability
studies", p. 648-649)

Further, [[deconstructing differences will not]{.mark} in and of itself
[produce respect and equality between all people with various
characteristics. Neither will it result in a social order free from a
sense of difference.]{.mark} It is simply unrealistic to assume that a
society could exist were people would not see some other people as
different]{.underline}, and their lives or characteristics as
representing a deviation from some norm considered important regarding
good human life. This is because [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[individual characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} that define disabled
people [[are, sometimes]{.underline}]{.mark} with good reason,
[[undesirable, even in a utopia]{.mark} where all differences would have
been queered.]{.underline} [**[Disability is not the same]{.mark}**
as]{.underline} many [other group identities]{.underline} and we need to
explore both morally and socially disability and difference rather than
simply use difference as a concept through which to critique the
disability identity. [There are no rational reasons to consider
homosexuality or gender undesirable characteristics whatever the social
context,]{.underline} but there are many impairments that can reasonably
be seen as undesirable (Shakespeare 2006). [[Motor neuron disease,
depression or spinal cord injury are]{.underline}]{.mark} the kinds of
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we would prefer not to]{.mark}
have, and this is not merely because of the cultural representations
attached to them but because **[these conditions]{.mark} are the kinds
of predicaments that [cause suffering irrespective of one's cultural
environment.]{.mark}** In [acknowledging]{.mark} that
[impairments]{.mark} can include an undesirable dimension **[does not
imply devaluing people with impairments]{.mark}** nor their positive
group identity]{.underline} (Shakespeare and Watson 2010). As long as
people are genuinely free to decide for themselves and feel about
themselves however they wish to feel, we are pretty close to relational
justice, free from hierarchical evils. [Imposing on people ableist or
disablist assumptions is certainly wrong, but so would be the denial of
the personal experiences]{.underline} of fearing the loss of one's
physical and mental capacities, or the fear of dying (Carel 2008). [To
explain the psychological anguish related to conditions such as motor
neurone disease or depression merely in terms of internalized oppression
and ableism would be insensitive]{.underline}, disrespectful and simply
nonsensical.

#### Centering the question of antiblackness in educational spaces is necessary to disrupt the antiblack logics of the nation state that pathologize black youth as lacking intellectualism

Justin A. **Coles 2021** "It's really geniuses that live in the hood":
Black urban youth curricular un/makings and centering Blackness in
slavery's afterlife, Curriculum Inquiry, DOI:
10.1080/03626784.2020.1856622\]//sheima

In regards to antiblackness, [[learning was rooted in the specific idea
that Black people lacked intellectualism]{.underline}]{.mark} (Anderson,
1988; Ladson-Billings, 2006; Ruelas, 2017; Williams, 2009). However,
many scholars have documented the ways Black people were more than
capable of, and possessed a fierce desire for, learning (Anderson, 1988;
Cornelius, 1991; Gundaker, 2007; Payne & Strickland, 2008; Span, 2009;
Williams, 2009). The deficit theory of Black anti-intellectualism was
used because whites owning enslaved persons understood that Black
learning would subvert slavery's structure. In particular, whites held
the belief that "learning will spoil the ~~nigger~~ for work" (Anderson,
1988, p. 6 J. A. COLES 20). While some enslaved Blacks were granted
access to literacy to aid in basic tasks to help run the property, such
as helping with accounts and supplies, this was not the reality for most
(Gundaker, 2007). ¶ [[Socially constructed]{.mark} and stereotypical
[imaginings of Black people as "less able to think
abstractly]{.mark}]{.underline}," were used by whites to argue that
Blacks were naturally fit for slavery (Plous & Williams, 1995, p. 796).
As Ruelas (2017) explained, "slave masters were intent on keeping their
slaves illiterate." Due to the ways antiblackness positioned Black
people as less than, the majority of those enslaved were excluded from
all educational experience. Indeed, the enslaved "were not allowed
books, pen, ink, nor paper, to improve their minds" (Williams, 2009, p.
9). The mind of the slave was deemed a non-factor, which facilitated the
ways they were reduced solely to their ability to labor (Spivey, 1978)
and to fuel and sustain capitalism (Smith, 2012).¶ After emancipation,
many white northern missionaries, full of zeal, went to the US South to
educate Blacks (Anderson, 1988; Bush, 2004; Jones, 1992; Williams,
2009). However, this enthusiasm diminished as they "began to realize
that [they had failed to understand the full effects of generations of
slavery]{.underline}" (Newby & Tyack, 1971, p. 195). Bullock (1967, p.
93) revealed that educators "decided to sell the idea of Negro education
to white Southerners by sacrificing the principle of racial equality
...the best way to assure the sale was to emphasize its value to the
purchaser" (as cited in Newby & Tyack, 1971, p. 196). [History reveals
that [the]{.mark} living and [learning experiences of Black
youth]{.mark} are rooted in the full effects of chattel slavery and
[sustained through sacrificing racial equality]{.mark}]{.underline};
making curriculum for Black children one of the US' earliest projects in
interest convergence or when "the interest of blacks in achieving racial
equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests
of whites" (Bell, 1980, p. 523).¶ Centering Blackness as Critique of
Antiblackness Today, Black youth are still not fully benefitting from
educational experiences (Baszile, 2019; Caldera, 2020; Coles & Powell,
2020; Lozenski, 2017; Ohito, 2016), [because antiblackness continues to
manifest in present-day curriculum (Brown & Brown, 2020). This becomes
clear when we understand that "[the telos of educational praxis]{.mark}
for most schools [can only come into being through the logics of the
imperialist, (settler) colonialist state]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Snaza,
2019, p. 13). [In our nation, [where the legacy of slavery and antiBlack
racism is the paradigmatic signifier of white settler supremac]{.mark}y
(Day, 2015), [curriculum can be understood as anti-Black by
d]{.mark}esign]{.underline}. ¶ Regardless of a student's Black
ethnicity, how they dress, or their buy-in to myths of Black
exceptionalism, Black youth have "no permanent shield against the
injuries of racism," or "the enduring impact of anti-Blackness in
everyday life" (Wallace, 2018, p. 278). Distinctly, the schooling of
Black people in the US has served as a site of racial animus and
miseducation throughout history and continues to serve as a site of
Black suffering (Dumas, 2014). [While [antiblackness robs Black youth of
affirming curricular spaces]{.mark}, schools are also robbed of the
dynamic knowledges of Black children, Black genius.]{.underline}
Ladson-Billings' (1995) concept of culturally relevant pedagogy and
subsequent asset based concepts like culturally sustaining pedagogy
(Paris & Alim, 2014) are in fact fueled by the idea that the lives of
Black and other minoritized youth can inform the ways schools become
better, more humanizing social institutions.¶ Here, I am reminded of
Gaztambide-Fernandez and Murad's (2011) curriculum imperative of
browning curriculum and pedagogy or examining "race, nation, and their
intersections with multiple forms of oppression within curriculum
studies" (p. 15). [[Through browning, we can "force the hidden hand of
the racism that lurks at every turn of the curriculum studies
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernandez, 2013, pp.
83--84), [revealing "the ways in which colonial heteropatriarchal White
supremacy continues to pervade curriculum studies]{.underline}"
(Gaztambide-Fernandez & Murad, 2011, p. 15). Brown and Au (2014)
extended [[curricular browning]{.mark}, charging the field to "give
specific and detailed theoretical attention to issues of 'race' and
curriculum that address the material, historical, and discursive
processes of 'race' and racism]{.underline}" (p. 381). However, for this
to manifest, [[educators need to critically
evaluate]{.underline}]{.mark} what Dyson (2015) labeled as
[**[ideologically charged institutional discourse]{.mark}**, which
categorizes Black students as inherently less than, resulting in ongoing
Black curricular exclusion.]{.underline} ¶ If we consider the ways [[US
curriculum sustains antiblackness by resting in]{.mark} ahist[orical
narratives that marginalize "the myriad ways that Black people lived in
and shaped U.S. life]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Brown & Brown, 2020, p. 76),
it can be deduced that Black people suffer at the hands of curriculum by
having their Blackness devalued. **[[Centering Blackness]{.mark} in
[curriculum is necessary to facilitate the disruption of
learning]{.mark} designed through [the anti-Black logics of the
nation-state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The need for a
[centering]{.mark} of [Blackness]{.mark} in curriculum that [leverages
critiques of antiblackness]{.mark}, becomes evident when we understand
that "thus far [there has been little theorizing in education on the
specificity of antiBlack racism]{.mark}"]{.underline}** or what Dumas
(2016b) contends "is the broader terrain of anti- blackness" (p. 12).
While antiblackness will always find a home within curriculum, I contend
that [through a direct centering of Blackness, curriculum workers can be
more attentive in efforts to co-construct curricular spaces that
position Black youth life-worlds as essential]{.underline}. ¶
