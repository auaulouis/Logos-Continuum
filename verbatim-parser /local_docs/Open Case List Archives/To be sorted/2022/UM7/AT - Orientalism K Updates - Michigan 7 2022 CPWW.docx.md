### Russia threat is real

#### **The Russian cyber threat is very real**

**Kakaes 3/22**(Konstantin Kakaes, 3-22-2022, \"How real is Russia's
cyber threat?,\" POLITICO,
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/03/22/how-real-is-russias-cyber-threat-00019386)**//BRownRice**

WEB OF UNCERTAINTY --- "As the world's most technically advanced nation,
the [[United States]{.underline}]{.mark} is also [potentially the most
[vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats]{.mark}]{.underline}," John Markoff
warned in The New York Times more than two decades ago, in October 1999.
[Like the nuclear threat of the Cold War, which loomed over daily life
for nearly half a century, the possibility of "[simultaneous]{.mark}
computer network [attacks]{.mark} [against banking, transportation,
commerce and]{.mark} utility targets --- as well as against the
[military]{.mark},"]{.underline} as the Times put it long before the
internet was a central to society as it is today, has become part of the
backdrop of modern life. Those [[fears became]{.mark} more vivid ---
more [real]{.mark}]{.underline} --- than ever before on Monday evening,
when President Joe Biden, addressing business leaders, said "the
[[magnitude]{.mark} of Russia's cyber capacity is [fairly]{.mark}
[consequential]{.mark} and it's coming.]{.underline}"
[Trillions]{.underline} of dollars have been [spent on
cybersecurity]{.underline} this century. Despite that, as a society, [we
are less resilient to cyberattacks today]{.underline} than we were in
1999. Ridesharing services that rely on networked communications and
positioning systems have largely replaced taxis that relied on drivers
who knew their way around; smartphones have become essential to the
conduct of business; even grocery stores are growing dependent on
sophisticated computational surveillance systems. Even so, it is hard to
know what to make of [[Biden's]{.mark} warning]{.underline}. On the one
hand, he is [privy to secret intelligence, and that [intelligence was
right]{.mark} [about]{.mark} Vladimir Putin's willingness to invade
[Ukraine]{.mark} with an army of tanks and airplanes.]{.underline} On
the other, cyber pundits have so far been mistaken about the cyberwar
that was supposed to accompany Putin's Ukraine invasion. "They will do
things that will ruin people and cause great harm. This is a serious
thing. It's not just about making the lights go on and off," Lt. Gen.
Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe, told
POLITICO's Maggie Miller in January. And Jonathan Reiber, the former
chief strategy officer for cyber policy in Obama's Pentagon said in
January, "This may end up being the first declared hostility where
cyberspace operations are a part of an integrated offensive military
invasion." That hasn't happened. Even as Ukraine has been pummeled by
bombs and artillery strikes, cyberattacks have been --- so far --- muted
in Ukraine, and there haven't yet been any notable attacks on the U.S.
In an article coming Wednesday morning in POLITICO that examines why
Russia hasn't launched major cyberattacks in Ukraine (and is available
to POLITICO Pro subscribers right now), Hodges acknowledges that the
"cyber juggernaut" he expected never materialized. It's unclear whether
this is because Russia didn't want to, or because it couldn't. Russia's
brutal invasion has lacked strategic coherence, in the cyber realm as in
others. Had cyberattacks made it harder for Ukrainians to communicate,
it seems inevitable that Volodymyr Zelenskyy would have been less
effective at drumming up international support for Ukraine. The exact
extent of Russia's cyber capabilities remains opaque. [[If Russia is
capable]{.mark} of a serious cyberattack against the U.S., [then
now]{.mark}, after Russia has been frustrated in its attempt to swiftly
conquer Ukraine, [could be the moment]{.mark} when it comes. Because
cyberattacks are generally difficult to definitively attribute, they
could provide a way for Putin to bring the war to Americans while
[making it difficult for U.S. policymakers to retaliate]{.mark} in
kind.]{.underline} Plus, as Biden said Monday, in the U.S. it's the
private sector, not the government, that largely decides "the
protections we will or will not take" against cyberattacks that might
disrupt our electricity or our water supplies. He called on business
leaders to do their part to "secure every American's privacy." So far,
since Markoff's essay in 1999, the possibility of what was then called
an electronic Pearl Harbor, and more recently a [[cyber Pearl
Harbor]{.underline}]{.mark}, has remained just that: a
[[possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. The cyberattacks that have taken
place, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, have been
headaches for their targets but not world-historical catastrophes. If a
momentous, long-feared attack from Russia does come, that could change.
The world could be reshaped in unpredictable ways, as it was after Sept.
11, 2001, and as it was after the onset of the pandemic. Cyberattacks
can have temporary effects, or they can have more lasting ones. A
blackout that lasted months would transform life, as food spoiled and
hospital generators ran out of gas, and might be treated as an act of
war. To be clear, these are purely speculative threats. They don't seem
realistic, nor worth worrying about. Planning for very low probability
but very high impact events --- a cyber black swan --- is nearly
impossible. It feels a little irresponsible even to speculate about
them. But then, [the idea that the world would endure nearly two years
of lockdowns as businesses shut globally once seemed far-fet ched
too.]{.underline}

#### Russia threat real

**Mcinnis and Fata 5/20** (Kathleen J. Mcinnis, Daniel Fata, 5-20-2022,
\"Russia Is a Real Threat to NATO,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/20/russia-threat-nato-madrid-summit/)**//BRownRice**

Recent events in [Ukraine]{.underline} have once again
[proved]{.underline} that [reports of NATO's death are an
exaggeration]{.underline}. Many [leaders]{.underline} across the
alliance have been [quick to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine
with aid to Kyiv]{.underline}, increases in their own country's defense
budgets, or both. [But as the war grinds on and the geopolitical reality
of an adversarial relationship with Russia sets in, NATO must once again
take the longer view on what all this means for trans-Atlantic and
global security.]{.underline} Conveniently, in less than two months,
[NATO leaders]{.underline} will meet in Madrid to [endorse]{.underline}
the alliance's [new strategy.]{.underline} The key question, therefore,
is whether member states will use the moment to reforge NATO's raison
d'être to meet current and future challenges---in particular, by naming
Russia as a threat to the alliance itself. Given the implications of
Ukraine for European and global order, the stakes could hardly be
higher. Some take the view that Madrid should mark a reprioritization of
U.S. efforts away from Europe and back toward Asia. Their logic goes
that not only is European defense spending increasing, but Russia has
also demonstrated ineptitude in the prosecution of its war in Ukraine.
That means the longer-term need for significant U.S. forces in Europe
has also therefore declined. And, after all, China is the pacing threat
for Department of Defense planning. In fact, the opposite is true. For
starters, [Russia]{.underline}n President Vladimir Putin [has made it
abundantly clear that he views NATO as a strategic threat]{.underline}.
Recent events suggest we should take these statements at face value. In
the runup to the current war, some [analysts developed elaborate
rationales for why the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border
didn't mean an invasion was coming, such as a strengthened negotiating
position vis-à-vis Ukraine's future political directions. Another
Russian invasion of Ukraine was so obviously strategically
counterproductive that there must have been another reason for the
buildup. In the event, there wasn't.]{.underline} Expand your
perspective with unlimited access to FP. SUBSCRIBE NOW And [while
Russian military incompetence has been startling, planners shouldn't
leap to conclusions. Russian forces were not able to capture Kyiv, but
they have been able to seize tens of thousands of square miles of
territory along Ukraine's eastern border---at least for now. Estonia, a
Baltic NATO member that borders Russia, is less than 20,000 square miles
in size. Militaries can also reform, especially after disaster, as
Ukraine's own army did after its failures in 2014. The United States has
good reasons to want to keep NATO vibrant]{.underline}: The strategic
[benefits of U.S. leadership are manifold]{.underline}. Not only does
American leadership in NATO provide pathways for [organizing military
coalitions]{.underline}, but it also affords the United States
[privileged status on trade partnerships]{.underline} and access to
bases. [If Putin achieves his aim of discrediting NATO, this could lead
to trans-Atlantic strategic insolvency: a situation whereby allies,
including the United States, are unable to meet their security
obligations and, relatedly, maintain favorable standards of living for
their populations.]{.underline} Which brings us back to Madrid. The last
time that NATO agreed on a strategic concept was in 2010. It is a
document that specified that, among other things, defense of allied
territory remains a critical mission for the alliance, but it is silent
on naming nation-state threats to NATO. For a variety of domestic and
international political reasons, building formal consensus on threats
among 30 allied states is extremely challenging. Indeed, in the 2010
document Russia is viewed as an aspirational partner for NATO when it
comes to European security---despite the warning sign of Russia's 2008
invasion of Georgia. In the intervening years, Russia has conducted
destabilizing disinformation campaigns in NATO states and has attacked
Ukraine twice. And while NATO leaders have condemned Russian aggression,
the rhetoric falls short of formally declaring Russia as a long-term
strategic threat to the alliance. Durable consensus requires clarity. To
prepare NATO to contend with this threat over the long term requires a
frank admission of the strategic realities that Russia poses in the
alliance's new strategic concept, to be adopted in Madrid. As a
practical matter, this will commit NATO members to take budgeting, force
planning, acquisition, and possible troop repositioning seriously---and
put teeth into the declaration. This is needed for NATO planners to
determine, for example, whether spending 2 percent of GDP on defense is
sufficient to meet the challenges to the alliance. But the real value of
the document is what the collective members reaffirm as to what NATO
continues to stand for, what it calls out as the threats to the member
territory, and what it intends to do to address, deter, and, if
necessary, defend against these threats. By stating up front that Russia
is a formal threat, member states---and the alliance as a whole---will
find it harder to backslide from their current cohesion. It is difficult
to overstate how important it is for NATO to ensure its consensus is
durable; as the war grinds on and publics begin feeling the economic
effects of the conflict and sanctions on Russia, the temptation to
dilute support to Ukraine will undoubtedly mount. Not to mention,
calling it like it is will send an important message to Putin: NATO will
not be deterred. [Words matter. It is time for NATO leaders to formally
accept reality: Putin is a threat to the alliance and its members, and,
therefore, they should declare so in the news strategic concept. Indeed,
not declaring Russia a formal threat to NATO territory would compromise
NATO's credibility and would give Putin a pass for the atrocities and
violations he has committed in Ukraine. Neither NATO nor the United
States can afford to allow that to happen.]{.underline}

### Ballot key/ballot good

#### Accumulating ballots is good and key because it forces engagement with our method -- simply modelling USFG policy replicates the racist tendencies of the state and forcing us to engage with it is equally harmful

**Reid Brinkey 8**(THE HARSH REALITIES OF "ACTING BLACK": HOW
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICY DEBATERS NEGOTIATE REPRESENTATION THROUGH RACIAL
PERFORMANCE AND STYLE, Shanara Rose Reid Brinkley, 2008, Page
114-115)**//BRownRice**

Signifyin' on institutional symbols of American democracy, Jones' draws
attention to the [[parallels in power structures between]{.mark} the
federal [government and]{.mark} the decision-making arms of the [debate
community]{.mark}.]{.underline} The "halls of Congress" represent the
halls of debate tournaments. ["[Capitol Hill]{.mark}" where the laws of
this country are enacted [is a metaphor for]{.mark} debate tournament
[tabroom]{.mark}s where wins and losses are catalogued. Tournament
[ballots]{.mark} metaphorically [represent the]{.mark} signing of the
[judges ballot]{.mark} at the conclusion of debates. In facts, [debaters
often argue]{.mark} that the "impacts" they identify or the solvency for
their plan happens "[once the judge signs the ballot]{.mark}," as if
assigning a winner or loser [actually results in the passage of a
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Jones argues that it is [the ballot that is
the [most significant tool in influencing]{.mark} the practices and
procedures of [the community]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, the
[competitive nature of debate guarantees]{.underline} that [teams and
coaches remain responsive to trends amongst the judging
pool.]{.underline} Ultimately[, [debate]{.mark}]{.underline} competition
[[is a run to]{.mark} capture or win the judges ballot.]{.underline}
That [[the ballot]{.underline}]{.mark} "enacts" the "policies" of the
debate "community," [[makes the space of competition a critical arena
from which to attempt community change]{.underline}]{.mark}. Up until
this point, the policy debate community had dealt with issues of
diversity and inclusion outside of tournament competition. Directors,
coaches, assistants, and debaters may have engaged in outreach and
recruitment practices designed to diversify the debate community, but
discussions and support for such actions were not generated from debate
tournament competition. Those discussions occurred in collaborative
versus competitive settings where stakeholders were encouraged to
dialogue without concern for winners or losers. For example, OSI (the
original non-profit arm of the UDL) sponsored Ideafests to bring
stakeholders in the debate community together to discuss the national
expansion of the UDL. Thus, [Green's following argument during
tournament competition directly violates the traditional practice of
discussing issues of diversity and inclusion in the community, outside
of competitive debate rounds: [Racism is]{.mark} one of the [leading
export]{.mark}s [of the United States]{.mark} Federal
Government]{.underline} and it exploits it on to other countries. It
[doesn't acknowledge its problems at home and the [debate community
replicates those values]{.mark} by playing in this fantasy world that we
cannot change. [By]{.mark} sitting silent, by [not]{.mark}
acknowledging, or [addressing]{.mark} the [problems within this
community]{.mark}. I]{.underline}t is easy for us to say that there are
problems racism and sexism but the [[problem comes when we
recognize]{.mark} those systemic [issues and do nothing to change our
methods]{.mark} of how we challenge those problems.]{.underline}109
Green is [[hold]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the [[debate community
accountable]{.mark} for its failure]{.underline} in significantly
increasing diversity and inclusion. They hold teams accountable for
their methodological choices in debate participation forcing other teams
and judges to consider whether or not the traditional or normative ways
of engaging in competition result in an activity and environment hostile
to those debate bodies marked by difference. Let me remind you of the
use of the term "export" in the previous quotation. Green argues that
the [[US]{.mark} federal government "[exports]{.mark}" American
[racism]{.mark}]{.underline} to other nations. Significantly, they argue
that the [[debate community does the same]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[Louisville debaters]{.underline} [make a very controversial
argumen]{.underline}t, one that if true, [deeply wounds the debate
community]{.underline}. They argue that the [racism in the debate
community, j]{.underline}ust like U.S. institutional racism[, is
exported to the UDL.]{.underline} Note this excerpt from Jones: And, I
gave an example of the Urban Debate Leagues, how people don't recognize
how they export these type of oppressions onto Urban Debate Leagues,
when they assume that they are ignorant and have nothing to contribute
to this activity. So they teach them how to debate, never realize that
they know how to debate in the first place. This is the example, these
is the ways in which [[we have to change the social structures and the
power relations that affect our world]{.underline}]{.mark}."110 As I
stated earlier in this chapter, it is largely the development of the UDL
and its representations within the debate community that led to the
creation of the Louisville Project. Remember that the UDL is often held
as the communal exemplar that demonstrates the policy debate community's
commitment to diversity and inclusion. Thus, to argue that the debate
community perpetuates institutional racism even while acting against it
is a confrontational stance for the Project members.

#### Challenging the state is key

Lisa **Yoneyama 16**, 9-8-2016, \"Cold War Ruins: Transpacific Critique
of American Justice and Japanese War Crimes,\" Duke University Press,
<https://doi-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/10.1215/9780822374114>, kav

[Importantly, the redress activism reinvigorated in the United States
since the turn of the new century has enlisted Asian/Americans as **new
subjects of historical justice.**]{.underline}2 Underpinning reemerging
memories of Japanese imperial violence and the impetus to seek redress
in the U.S. judicial system is the heightened presence of Asian
immigrant-citizen-subjects and their growing importance in American
representative politics. The demographic shift in the U.S. body politic
is one crucial factor in the belated but increasing Asian/American
presence in redress activism. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
abolished ethnonational and racial quotas, leading to a dramatic
increase in immigration from Asia. Many new immigrants carried with them
traumatic memories of suffering and loss wrought by Japanese colonialism
as well as Japanese military invasions before and during the
Asia-Pacific War. Much of the institutional drive for redress therefore
comes from California and other North American locations where new and
old Asian populations now pose a significant representational force. The
Alliance for Preserving the Truth of Sino-Japanese War, the Global
Alliance for Preserving the History of wwII in Asia (ga), and the
Association for Learning and Preserving the History of wwII in Asia
(alpha)---three overlapping North American network organizations
demanding redress and apologies from the Japanese government and
corporations not exclusively but largely for Chinese victims of Japan's
aggressive war---are particularly noteworthy. Prompted by the
publication of Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking: Forgotten Holocaust of
World War II (1997), these organizations have also successfully
mobilized the nineties discourse of international criminal justice and
human rights to target Japanese war crimes.3 With regard to "comfort
women" redress, Korean/American and Asian/American transnational
feminists have deployed American juridical venues, legislatures,
communities, social media, and spaces of cultural production to
disseminate memories of the Japanese military's sex trafficking and
forced prostitution throughout the empire. In ways that were not
possible in the immediate aftermath of the war, [Asian/Americans have
emerged as new subjects of justice in the U.S. polity. The **increasing
visibility** of Asian/Americans in U.S. redress culture at the same time
reminds us of the ways in which the constitution of U.S. public
institutions and discourses has been a **racialized
process**.]{.underline} 4 More urgently, [attention to the racial
differences among subjects who pursue redress calls into question the
history of the **uneven distribution of power** within America's
nationalized liberal public sphere, forcing us to understand that
reparation issues concern more than **interstate normalization and
reconciliation**. Transborder redress culture affects **colonial
diasporic peoples** as well as refugees and migrants who were violently
uprooted by colonialism and war, and who became further displaced in
many cases as a result of the political and economic disfranchisement
they experienced in the process of decolonization.]{.underline} In
analyzing the Americanization of Japanese war crimes, the redress
[practices of colonial diasporic and migrant peoples emerge as critical
terrains of **possibility and scrutiny** for transnational practices
seeking **historical justice**. Americanization's new phase, at least in
the above sense, thus registers the nationalization of Asian
transnational migrants. Through subjectification to U.S. judicial,
legislative, and other state apparatuses of knowledge, Asian
immigrant-citizens are not only beckoned to speak as owners of and
witnesses to memories of Japanese imperial violence in Asia. They also
become **speaking subjects** by subjecting themselves to the
institutional arrangements that enable their speech and visibility, but
only to the extent to which they are recognized by the given parameters
of historical knowledge and the idea of justice.]{.underline} The
exploration of Japan's historical revisionists in the previous chapter
demonstrated that [**National History** performs a vital function as a
**normative epistemic apparatus** that **disciplines and interpellates**
nationalized citizen-subjects through mobilizing them toward the
**proper recitation** of the nation's honorable and supposedly uniformly
shared past. **The normative remembering of the nation's past is
intimately linked to the management of knowledge and subjectivities.**
Given such inseparable relationships among nationalism, normativity of
citizenship, history, power, and knowledge, what are the ramifications
of memories of Japanese imperial violence that travel from Asia and then
become integrated with hegemonic American war memories and the
persistent American discourse on historical justice]{.underline}? What
type of political subject might we anticipate this process
interpellates? The special issue of the Journal of Asian American
Studies, published in 2003, on "Korean Comfort Women" addressed
precisely this question by focusing on the Asian American investment in
Japan's wartime military "comfort women" issue. Guest-edited by the
American literary critic Kandice Chuh, the special issue was based on an
Association for American Studies (asa) session, titled "Siting/Citing
'Comfort Women' Critically: Transnational Memories in Korea-Japan-U.S.
Liaisons."5 In her essay theorizing the Asian American investment in
Japan's wartime military "comfort women" issue, Chuh raised a
fundamental question regarding Asian Americanists' objectification of
"comfort women."6 Chuh examined the literary representation of comfort
women by the works of two Korean American authors, Comfort Woman (1998),
by Nora Okja Keller, and A Gesture Life (2000), by ChangRae Lee, calling
into question the "highly troubling ideological and political ends" the
Asian American knowledge of "comfort women" might accommodate (8). Laura
H. Y. Kang's essay in the special issue likewise problematized the
Americanization of Korean "comfort women" and its effect on knowledge
and power.7 Asking "who are and should be the 'we' who must remember and
represent this subject," Kang argued for the urgent need to attend to
the "multiple mediations and disciplinizations" (28) that are integral
to the economy of Americanized "comfort women" knowledge, or the process
she saw as "the various conjurings of 'comfort women'" (46). As an
alternative to such an Americanization of "comfort women" discourse,
Kang calls our attention to the issue of class, suggesting the need to
consider "what U.S. citizenship might mean not only for differently
racialized and gendered but also differently capitalized subjects" (47).
[The investigations into the new phase of the Americanization of
memories of Japanese imperial violence and the historical justice they
call for can most productively yield critical politico-intellectual
outcomes when situated in the perspectives put forward by the above
Asian/American interventions.]{.underline} In keeping with Chuh's and
Kang's theorizations, in what follows I explore the not-so-uniform
effects of Asian/American mobilization into redress efforts within the
U.S. public sphere. I will focus on juridicohistorical discourse---a
nexus of power and historical knowledge produced by juridical
practices---and intend to closely examine the ways in which
[Asian/Americans are erected as the law's agent-subject who enunciates,
enacts, or at other times defers, not a single but multiple ideas of
historical justice. American discourse on Japanese war crimes is
profoundly **shaped by U.S. nationalism and assumptions** about
modernity, liberalism, colonialism, and postcoloniality that are
embedded in Cold War epistemologies. Asian/America, as a discursively
constituted terrain, is deeply implicated in this knowledge
production]{.underline}.8 [And yet Asian/Americans as new subjects of
justice animated by the power invested in them as American
citizen-subjects also necessarily illuminate contradictions of
transnationality within the American civic sphere in such a way that
they hold out the possibility of a radical politicization of justice and
a critique of Americanization.]{.underline}9 Asian/American involvement
in redress unveils, often inadvertently, the long history of
entanglements and the complicity of imperial violence, as well as the
amnesia about these matters between Japan and the United States. In this
process, juridico-historical discourse may produce new subjects and
publicity that transnationally rally around antiracist, decolonial
notions of history and justice. At the same time, however, [this process
is not automatic or easily decipherable. Asian/Americans, as the
agent-subjects of U.S. state apparatuses, tend to secure their
**nationalized status** by **underwriting America's Cold War myth of
liberation and rehabilitation vis-à-vis Asia.** The North American
liberal, multicultural nationalism, moreover, has effectively mobilized
Asian ethnonationalisms as an enabling constituent element.]{.underline}
Continuing the work of the previous chapters, in the following I seek
out an analytic with which we might discern the risks, the
possibilities, and the multiple and contested implications of this
seemingly new phase in the Americanization of justice.

[Said makes two criticisms of Marx]{.underline}. (1) According to Said,
[[Marx advances]{.mark} "the [notion of an Asiatic economic

India"]{.underline}2 [as well as the idea of a "[fundamentally lifeless
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}" (O, 154). B[oth notions are by this account
