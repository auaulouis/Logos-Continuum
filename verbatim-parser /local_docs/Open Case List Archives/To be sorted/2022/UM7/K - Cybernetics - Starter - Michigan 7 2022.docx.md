# K---Cybernetics---DML

## Notes

### 101

It seems appropriate to begin with Google's definition of "cybernetics,"
which is "the science of communications and automatic control systems in
both machines and living things." This critique is concerned with the
ways in which modern and emerging technologies are altering the
structural nature of "communications" (both the media we use to
communicate, like cellphones, social media, etc, and the ways that we
communicate with each other in terms of empathy, aggression, etc) and
"automatic control systems" (the systems and infrastructures that the
world relies on to communicate, both the physical components such as
power cables or satellites and the virtual components such as
algorithmic decisionmaking systems or metadata sets). Specifically, this
is a criticism of the affirmative's **epistemology**, or the way in
which it comes to know the world, and the sources, data, and ideological
influences that their thought and research draw upon. The core argument
is that scholarship which calls for security cooperation with NATO
states relies on outdated ideas about the effectiveness and utility of
traditional mechanisms of international law, and that these outdated
ideas offer useless (if not actively harmful) responses to the crises
created by the ongoing cybernetic transformation of the world. Consider
the core paradox of autonomous weapons regulation: if the weapons are
effectively regulated, then they aren't truly autonomous, but as soon as
they autonomous, we can't regulate them without potentially compromising
their effectiveness. By and large, the only way for international
security organizations like NATO to keep up with the growing amount of
security threates created by emerging technology is for those
organizations to *automate* their functions, including the process of
decisionmaking itself, using other new digital technologies. Thus,
according to the link, the affirmative (and not just its
scholarship---the action of the plan itself!) justifies the subtle
spread, normalization, and acceptance of digital technologies which make
it easier to monitor the population and extract data from them. That
process is unsustainable, violent, conducive to fascism, and results in
extinction.

The alternative to the continued datafication of the world is to focus
on cultivating embodied, corporeal relationships. This should be
understood somewhat, but not completely, literally; while the alt
authors would certainly advocate more in-person connections and
relationships, "corporeal care" is also something of a metaphor for the
innumerable, ineffable relationships which make up human sociality and
which lose something of their essence when translated into data. How
many 30-part Instagram stories from concerts that your friends went to
have you watched all the way through and actually enjoyed, let alone
gotten anything close to the experience of actually being there? Even
the person taking the video doesn't get the same experience from
rewatching it as they did from actually producing that moment of human
connection and entertainment, but it's the next best thing to being able
to actually reproduce it. The point is that these moments of connection,
collective experience, and relationality are metaphorically corporeal in
the sense that they don't last forever, but they do last
materially---the opposite of data---and paying attention to those
moments and focusing on generating more of them is a better way of
combatting the expanding cybernetic regime than outdated legal
instruments.

Part of the alt also involves "rearticulating cybernetic thought." I
used the term "rearticulating" in the tag because it's in the card; for
the purposes of explanation, it's roughly synonymous to "redirecting" or
"reorienting." I point this out not only to help resolve potential
confusion, but also to highlight an important theme in the literature,
which is that this is **not** a universal critique of technology, but a
critique of the ways in which certain technologies have come to
structure society. The point of the alt (and a reason that framework is
a **very important part** of this K) is not that we can never text
anyone (or record terrible 30-part concert Instagram stories), but that,
when making decisions that may impact what people choose to research in
the future (namely, how the judge decides which side did the better or
worse debating), we should try to discourage research that promotes
cybernetic models of thought, especially in military and security policy
contexts. Some technologies can even help with doing that; for example,
think about how Tabroom.com makes submitting ballots and entering easily
accessible feedback much simpler for judges while also making it easier
for debaters or their coaches to follow up with them (if they desire),
creating constructive two-way flows of information, or about how
opensourcing evidence or recording more rounds makes it easier for more
people to access the critique's arguments. Because power in the
cybernetic era is about analyzing the patterns across huge sets of data
and acting on them, this critique argues that we should focus less on
how big of an influence any individual debate round has on the
cybernetic episteme and more on proliferating disruptions to the overall
pattern of the cybernetic takeover of debate (or at least on
proliferating new patterns that make it easier to create those
disruptions).

### How To Read This File

The three biggest pieces of advice I can give when reading this file:

1.  **It's usually simpler than it seems**. The only thing these authors
    love more than big words is swapping them around for other big words
    interchangeably, but the arguments themselves are deceptively
    straightforward.

2.  **When it seems simple, don't second guess yourself.** You're more
    likely to be getting it than you are to be missing something.

3.  **Don't explain the arguments with the literature's language,
    explain the literature with your language and arguments.** It's okay
    if you don't know the precise meanings of the terms and phrases in
    your cards, or the exact ways to use them, as long as you feel
    confident that you grasp the meaning internally.

"Cybernetics" as an umbrella term encompasses a variety of different
fields of scholarship that overlap to varying degrees and that may not
actively refer to themselves using the term, and one consequence of this
that might make this K a bit intimidating is that the literature can
tend to use a lot of different (and complicated) terms to describe
similar things, or assume you're familiar with a variety of other
background literature bases that you might not otherwise be. To make it
simpler, I've included a few blocks and analytics throughout the file
(but not very many---you should write, and rewrite, your own blocks!).
While I also highly encourage reading background literature and primary
sources as much as you possibly can, if that's not possible for you or
if some of the super deep-cut Deleuze and Guattari-esque stuff is a bit
too much of a challenge, don't sweat it---just keep reading through the
file, and even if it takes some time and a few rereads or practice
speeches, you'll start to learn which terms and phrases mean similar
things (and which ones don't). A lot of these cards seem like they are
making much more complicated arguments than they are simply because they
use different (and often unnecessarily complex) terminologies than what
you're used to, but if you make a sustained effort to understand and
think them through, things will start to click soon enough. There's
nothing wrong with Googling definitions or reading Wikipedia articles to
get some background context, we all do it.

Related to the last point, when researching this K and picking and
choosing evidence, I tried to focus more on argumentative cohesiveness
than a totally uniform terminology. While some cards might make the
arguments using different terms, I think it's largely argumentatively
consistent. Similarly, when constructing the 1NC, I tried to prioritize
cards that explained their arguments soundly and coherently, even if
they didn't use the same language as the other 1NC cards. **Emmelhainz
21** in particular is (in my opinion) a very straightforward explanation
of most of the arguments and core ideas found throughout the file, and
even though I left it highlighted because it's quite long and wordy, I
would encourage reading through the entire un-underlined text (it's
nearly the entire article) and/or rehighlighting (or reunderlining!) it
yourself. I will include its definition of "episteme" here, just because
it's a term used throughout the file that some may be unfamiliar with:

"According to its Greek etymology, an "episteme" is a system of
understanding. In The Order of Things, Michel Foucault uses the term
"épistemè" to mean the nontemporal or a priori knowledge that grounds
what is taken as truth in a given moment. Several epistemes coexist at a
given time, as they constitute parts of various systems of power and
knowledge. The cybernetic episteme, as defined by the collective Tiqqun
some twenty years ago, describes our relationship to technology and
machines (which are inseparable from the workings of capitalism). The
cybernetic episteme is based on the modern tenet of progress and
human-led transcendence achieved through science and technology."

One thing along those lines that I think is important to emphasize:
**This is an epistemology K!** While many popular kritiks are premised
on arguments about ontology and ontological structures, and other
variants of cybernetics literature make ontological arguments (as well
as arguments using other theoretical frames), this K is about
**epistemological, not ontological, structures**. The difference is that
ontology refers to the way humans *are* essentially, in our essence or
spirit, whereas epistemology refers to the way humans *think* and
*know*. Ontology is a metaphysical question relating to structures that
shape us before we are born or exist; epistemology is a social question
relating to structures of thought and value that humans create and
influence (and that may take on lives of their own to influence humans
back). You should debate this differently than you would debate kritiks
about ontology!

The titles of some of the impacts might seem a bit high-concept or
meme-y, but try to look past that, because I think they all more or less
do a pretty good job of explaining the concepts in a straightforward
manner. Except "Exchange Abstraction." I don't really know what to say
about that one.

Lastly, I really encourage you to make this file your own. Like I said,
there are a lot of different phrases and ideas across these cards, and
my organizational system/header naming choices are by no means perfect,
so if you are having trouble working with this file as is, consider
reorganizing it in ways that you're more comfortable with. If you think
that some cards work better in the 1NC or in particular blocks than
others, or you want to rewrite some tags or recut some cards, then
you're absolutely right, because that's what works for you.

### Kritik---1NC

#### Security cooperation over emerging technology [expands]{.underline} and [obscures]{.underline} cybernetic models of thought. The plan leaves the [thinking]{.underline} that engenders regulatory problems [untouched]{.underline}.

**Noll, 19**---professor of international law at the Department of Law,
School of Business, Economics and Law, Gothenburg University (Gregor,
"War by Algorithm: The End of Law?," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter 4,
78-81, dml)

This guidance is analogous to the guidance of human behavior by the law.
[The law informs me about the consequences of my actions]{.underline}:
when I read the law, [I understand that I will be locked
away]{.underline} in a prison if I intentionally take the life of
another person. But [the law also informs the consequences of my
actions]{.underline}: [the law and its institutions ensure that I am
locked away]{.underline} once I have committed a murder.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [makes the law inform my conduct by
dissuading me]{.underline} from committing murder [through]{.underline}
the prospect of **[legal penalties]{.underline}**. The intransitive
usage of "to inform" is linked to the transitive one: [**over** and
**above** its enabling capacity]{.underline}, [the law also has
**agentic capacities**]{.underline}. [Law and technology come together
in this double capacity]{.underline}, Hildebrandt suggests.11 [Any use
of technology is normative]{.underline}, [as is any use of the
law]{.underline}. Technically and legally guided cognition are both
enabling and agentic.

Earlier, I pointed out a deceptive binary at work in the debate on LAWS:
either heteronomy or autonomy, either inside or outside the law, either
a human or a machine subject. Here is a third option: [the subject is a
**situation-specific constellation** of human and machine]{.underline}.
If we accept, for the time being, that it is the intertwining of
enabling and constraining capabilities that characterizes both law and
technology, we seem to have a larger research program, of which this
chapter forms part: to map in detail how [the way in which a
**human**]{.underline}, [a **machine**]{.underline}, [and a **piece of
law** are brought together with the world **produces normative
consequences**]{.underline}.

Let me introduce four technologies that help us to understand the way
normativity is at work in the emergent form of war:

[Robotics is about the combination of mechanical
constructions]{.underline}, [power sources]{.underline}, [and
algorithmic code in a machine that **replaces** humans]{.underline}.
Current military applications include small tracked robots accompanying
infantry or special forces, unmanned aerial vehicles for attack
purposes, and unmanned naval vessels engaging enemy submarines. Future
applications might include humanoid robots that act as soldiers. The
emphasis in robotics is on a mechanical body that replaces the human
body. Algorithmic code forms part of robotics but is not necessarily the
key feature. The development of humanoid soldiers, for example, is still
hampered by limited power supply.

[In military contexts]{.underline}, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [has a **very wide range** of
uses]{.underline}. AI is a field in computer science that focuses on
tasks that are easy for humans and hard for computers. AI assists in,
inter alia, planning campaigns, making sense of intelligence, or finding
and engaging targets. Examples stretch from the DART system for
logistics planning, which has been in use since Operation Desert Storm
in 1991, to the identification of enemies and non-supportive populations
in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (2001--2014). AI also
enabled the development of advanced simulation systems for military
training and systems capable of visual recognition. One way of
describing AI is that it revolves around the mental states of artificial
neural networks. These networks take their cue from understandings of
how the human brain's neural networks function. [The focus in AI is on
replacing human cognition]{.underline}, or parts of it, [with **enhanced
machine cognition**]{.underline}.

In military contexts, [**neurotechnology** might]{.underline} enhance
and speed up the targeting process by combining unconscious human
cognition with the processing power of computers. Experimental
applications comprise, inter alia, threat detection and targeting
systems, but also applications to assist veterans in recovering from
PTSD. The idea is to [**combine** algorithmic machines and human
cognition]{.underline} in a way that leverages the advantages of each.
In concrete terms, artificial neural networks and the neuronal signals
of the human brain are pooled.

[Recent developments in **genomics** have spawned a discussion of its
potential military uses]{.underline}. One possibility that is within
reach is the selection of soldiers based on their genetic
characteristics. [This]{.underline} process [opens up new ways of
**reading the human**]{.underline} and her capabilities. A more distant
possibility is the [genomic enhancement]{.underline} of soldiers. That
process [is analogous to **programming an algorithm** inside a
human]{.underline} or, metaphorically, writing her. [The human genome is
altered as a programmer would alter software to better achieve a
particular end]{.underline}.

What do [these forms of technologically driven warfare have in
common]{.underline}? It is [the **amalgamation** of
**machine**]{.underline} properties [with **human**]{.underline}
properties [in an open architecture in which **none** of them can be
isolated from any other]{.underline}.12 In robotics, we encounter a move
out of the human flesh into machine bodies. From a human perspective,
robotics is excarnation. (I will come back to what this might mean in
the section "Why Do Code and Law Rule in Such Different Ways?")
Similarly, AI is a move out of the human flesh and the human's embodied
mental states into artificial mental states created by computers. From a
human perspective, AI is also excarnation, if we understand the mental
states thus outsourced to be attributes of our corporeal existence.
Conversely, genomics is all about incarnation: it transfers the artifice
of coding into the human flesh. Neurotechnology is the hard case:
because it assembles artificial mental states and human neuronal
signals, it wavers between excarnation and incarnation. If we are
interested [in **regulation**]{.underline}, this case is the most
sensitive one---and the most productive to think about. This is all the
more so as [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [a
**dominant actor** in the development of advanced weaponry]{.underline},
[has **emphasized**]{.underline} man--machine collaboration in its use
of military AI technologies,13 and Elon Musk has thrown his political
and economic weight behind the development of "ultra high bandwidth
brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers."14

This bleeding of machine and human into each other is not that much of a
surprise, though, if we consider that all four technologies are the
products of **[cybernetic thinking]{.underline}**. Cybernetics embraces
the entire field of control and communication theory and makes no
distinction between machine or animal.15 Using the concepts of feedback
and self-regulation, "[cyberneticists claimed to be able to
build]{.underline} the [living agency]{.underline} of an organic being
[into]{.underline} artificial [machinery]{.underline}."16 [Think of
**robotics** and **AI**]{.underline}, and you are thinking of a
discipline [in which machines are acquiring **human-like
autonomy**]{.underline}. [Think of **genomics**]{.underline}, and you
are thinking of a discipline [in which humans are acquiring]{.underline}
a **[machine-like adaptability]{.underline}** to extreme circumstances.
[Think of **neurotechnology**]{.underline}, and you are thinking of an
area [in which machines are acquiring]{.underline} the
**[human]{.underline}** property of speedy
**[recognition]{.underline}**---or where humans are acquiring the
machine property of speedy electric-signal processing. By contrast, it
is much easier for noncybernetic common sense to separate the gunsight
from the soldier, the book from its reader, and the pair of glasses from
its wearer.

Here, [we experience the **normative repercussions** of a **model of
thinking**]{.underline}. [If we opt for **cybernetics**]{.underline},
[we opt for a mode of thought that **makes no distinction** between
humans and machines]{.underline}. What scares us about LAWS must then be
assumed to be what scares us about man. And we find that [the
**technology developed** on the basis of cybernetic assumptions actually
**fuses** humans and machines in a way that **engenders regulatory
problems**]{.underline}. [We try to **solve** these problems by
**limiting** the development of technology]{.underline} (e.g., by
arguing for a ban on "autonomous" weapons), [but the **thinking** that
shapes them is **left untouched**]{.underline}. [If a legal
ban]{.underline} ([or the absence of one]{.underline}) [is
**normative**]{.underline}, [then cybernetics is a]{.underline} form of
**[second-order normativity]{.underline}**. [Cybernetics is
about]{.underline} "control" as such and therewith also about
**[controlling control]{.underline}**. It is about regulation
[and]{.underline} therewith also about [the **regulation of
regulation**]{.underline}. [It is a regulatory thinking at a **more
foundational level** than an **ordinary international agreement**
banning a **particular**]{.underline} type of **[weapon]{.underline}**.
The question of "autonomous" AI applications is always already part and
parcel of the question of cybernetics. [The second-order
character]{.underline} of this thinking [means it **slips** from our
sight]{.underline}, [even as it **holds us captive**]{.underline} (see
Figure 4.1).

#### The cybernetic episteme threatens [extinction]{.underline}, generates [racist fascism]{.underline}, and unravels the [foundation of ethics itself]{.underline}.

**Emmelhainz, 21**---independent researcher and writer who has lectured
and taught at an array of international institutions (Irmgard,
"Authoritarianism and the Cybernetic Episteme, or the Progressive
Disappearance of Everything on Earth," e-flux #122, November 2021, dml)
\[section 4 was not omitted, the article just skips from 3 to 5\]

[Life and society worldwide have been **transformed** by digital
technology]{.underline}, [including the **fabrics** of emotional
relationships]{.underline}. [Many believed the internet would be
the]{.underline} largest ungoverned [space]{.underline} in the world
[with **unlimited**]{.underline} emancipatory
**[potential]{.underline}**, and trusted Big Tech to make the world a
better place. [Yet power and capitalism filled that space
with]{.underline} surveillance systems, the production of private
capital, the monetization of data, and the **[control]{.underline}** of
human lives. Social media now shape daily life and many have lost faith
in the possibility of a shared consensus reality. We are living in a
scenario similar to one imagined by Black Mirror: our belief in digital
communication and social media creates narcissistic personalities,
selves dissociated and dislocated from their reflections online. Digital
communication offers an opaque mirror that delivers egos without bodies,
eliding alterity.

The collapse of reality, however, is not an unintended consequence of
advancements in, for instance, artificial intelligence: it was the
long-term objective of many technologists, who sought to create machines
capable of transforming human consciousness (like drugs do).
[[Communication has become]{.mark} a site for the **extraction
of**]{.underline} surplus **[[value]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and images
operate as both commodities and dispositives for this extraction.
Moreover, [data mediates our **cognition**]{.underline}, that is to say,
the way in which we exist and perceive the world and others. The
image---and the [unlimited communication]{.underline} promised by
constant imagery---[have **ceased** to have emancipatory
potential]{.underline}. [Images place a veil over a world in which the
**isolated living dead**]{.underline}, [thirsty for stimulation and
dopamine]{.underline}, [give and collect likes]{.underline} on social
media. Platform users exist according to the Silicon Valley utopian
ideal of life's complete virtualization.

The internet, moreover, has radically changed the political
communications game and must be considered a complex propaganda
apparatus. Although a single Tweet can destroy someone's career, and
fake news can start a real news cycle, [meaning is **subordinate** to
the circulation of vacuous content]{.underline}. The capitalist capture
of data for profit does not rely on policing content; [the production of
[capital **only** relies on]{.mark} the **[constant]{.mark} exchange**
and **circulation** of [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}. We don't yet
know the full extent of the manipulation of companies such as Facebook,
Google, and Amazon in the last two elections in the US or in other
elections around the world. But it is undeniable that digital platforms
are actively censoring content in the interests of particular political
actors. For instance: in October 2020, Zoom canceled a meeting hosting
Palestinian human rights activist Leila Khaled; a month before, Facebook
and Twitter censored information detrimental to Joseph Biden's
presidential campaign. The same two companies intervened and shut down
pro-Trump accounts in 2020, even Donald Trump's own Facebook and Twitter
accounts.

After the attempted coup at the US capitol on January 6, 2020,
Facebook's recently instituted oversight board ruled that Trump had
created "an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible."
In this light, it seems likely that he will continue to be banned from
the platform. According to journalist Shoshana Zuboff, however, this is
insufficient, given that the oversight board's decision (whose work is
supported by a \$130 million endowment from Facebook) follows years of
inaction by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who indulged and appeased Trump while
entrenching what Zuboff calls "[surveillance capitalism]{.underline}." A
liberal might think that shutting up Trump and helping Biden is not bad,
as they are actions that seemingly advance the interests of the
Democratic Party. What is at stake here, however, is not whether the
platforms take a "good" or "bad" stance on a particular issue; the
problem [is]{.underline} that they have immense unchecked power and can
act as they please. Platforms are [allowed to **secretly extract**
behavioral data]{.underline} from users, whether or not users are aware,
transforming the information into targeted ads, [destroying
privacy]{.underline}, [changing human experience into data]{.underline},
[altering elections]{.underline}, [and **reshaping human
civilization**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} structure [can be
termed]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[cybernetic
episteme]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [and the new form of
control]{.underline}, which goes beyond the previous regime of biopower,
can be termed "**[neuropower]{.underline}**."

According to its Greek etymology, [an]{.underline}
"**[episteme]{.underline}**" [is a **system of
understanding**]{.underline}. In The Order of Things, Michel Foucault
uses the term "épistemè" to mean the nontemporal or a priori knowledge
that grounds what is taken as truth in a given moment. Several epistemes
coexist at a given time, as they constitute parts of various systems of
power and knowledge. [The **cybernetic episteme**]{.underline}, as
defined by the collective Tiqqun some twenty years ago, [describes our
relationship to technology and machines]{.underline} (which are
inseparable from the workings of capitalism). The cybernetic episteme is
[based on the modern tenet of **progress** and **human-led
transcendence**]{.underline} achieved [through science and
technology]{.underline}.

Under neuropower, the sensible gives way to cognitive pathologies. These
pathologies depend on the consumption of content rather than the sharing
of meaning. As Thomas Metzinger explains, [the internet has become an
**integral part** of how we model ourselves]{.underline}, as we use it
for external memory storage, as a cognitive prosthesis, and for
emotional self-regulation. [This [has]{.mark} **radically
[changed]{.mark}** the structure of [conscious
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a new
form of waking consciousness that resembles "a mixture of dreaming,
dementia, intoxication, and infantilization." Other effects of
neuropower are humans' growing invisibility to each other and [[a
**paroxysmal racism** that]{.underline}]{.mark} infiltrates power,
technology, culture, language, and work. For Franco "Bifo" Berardi,
racism has become a "virus" that [[exacerbates]{.underline}]{.mark}
fear---above all, [[the **fear of extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[which seems to have become [one of the **motors behind white
supremacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the world. Dissociated from our
environment, alienated from each other, we are oblivious to the
challenges that are being posed to humanity by the Capitalocene.

[A **complex form of authoritarianism** is emerging]{.underline}, linked
to digital platforms owned by the powerful CEOs who make up the
notorious "Silicon Six." Under the new authoritarianism, [[populations
are no longer **commanded**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[they are
**asked**]{.mark} **to participate**]{.underline}, and in [this
[**simulation** of involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}, the "ideology of
connection" **[[replaces]{.underline}]{.mark}** the idea of [[social
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[neutralizing]{.mark}** [democratic
demands]{.mark}]{.underline} from users to have control over their own
lives, rights, and data. In this way, [people are made
passive]{.underline}. Cédric Durand explains the difference between the
original conception of the World Wide Web and the subsequent development
of closed platforms. The WWW began as a decentralized architecture in
which a generic transaction protocol (http) and a uniform identification
format (URI/URL) generated a space of flat content. In this space, human
and nonhuman agents could have access to information without any
third-party mediation. In contrast, closed platforms use application
programming interfaces, or APIs, to mediate interaction, giving way to
data loops in which interactions are more dense. The technical object
that sustains this hierarchical architecture is the API, each of which
is owned by a platform. On the one hand, big platforms, by way of APIs,
offer apps that incorporate basic and indispensable data for users. On
the other, platforms have access to the additional information generated
by the API, such as user activity and buying habits. As the ecosystem
grows in complexity, the platform is able to accumulate more and more
data. We become more densely connected with each other and with the
platforms every day, as our lives get more and more tied to the cloud.
[Our dependency on platforms provides the ground for
**technofeudalism**]{.underline}. Historically, feudalism was
characterized by a fundamental inequality that enabled the direct
exploitation of peasants by lords. The lord was both the manager and
master not only of the process of production, but of the entire process
of social life. In today's technofeudalism, [platform owners are the
digital lords and users are the serfs]{.underline}. Rather than
commodity production, these platforms are geared towards accumulation
through rent, debt, and the privatization of the basic infrastructure
that sustains our lives. [What is at stake is **no longer**]{.underline}
"true" or "fake" [**information** but the **cybernetic episteme** upon
which our lives and subjectivities have been built]{.underline}.

The cybernetic episteme is premised upon modernity's enclosure of
experience. In modern epistemology, which is the precondition of the
cybernetic episteme, [the self is **externalized** and experienced at a
**remove** from the body]{.underline}. Perception is centered on the
brain and eyes instead of the whole body, separating sensation from
reason. The self's relationship with the world is mediated through
mirrors, camera lenses, the canvas, the microscope, and mathematical
models. [[The cybernetic episteme]{.underline}]{.mark}, moreover, [[is
**inextricable from colonialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which entails
**dispossession**]{.underline}, **[dislocation]{.underline}**,
**[dissociation]{.underline}**, [and **appropriation**]{.underline}.
Ariella Azoulay has called the logic underpinning these processes "the
shutter"; [this logic]{.underline} is materialized in photographic
technology that separates humans from objects, self from the world, and
people from their lands. The shutter [is the **principle of
imperialism** by which campaigns of plunder have left people both
**worldless** and **objectless**]{.underline}. For Azoulay, the logic of
the shutter was invented centuries before photography gave it a
technological apparatus, and it enabled the dispossession of non-Western
peoples in tandem with the accumulation of visual and material wealth in
archives and museums in the West.

[The cybernetic episteme]{.underline} is likewise conceptually
constituted by this shutter, since it [relies on
**capturing**]{.underline}, **[naming]{.underline}**,
**[moving]{.underline}**, [and **archiving** subjects]{.underline}---[as
does imperialism]{.underline}. In [this]{.underline} regard, the
cybernetic episteme [**naturalizes** the mediation of the
self]{.underline}; [it creates not only the condition of **detachment**
from the world]{.underline}, [but allows the **appropriation** of the
cultures of others]{.underline}, [as well as the **dissolution** of
collective being]{.underline}. The shutter is akin to Heidegger's
Gestell or "representation," which goes hand in hand with Eurocentrism
and Anthropocentrism. The Gestell and the shutter both imply that the
world and experience have become representation, through an aesthetic
order in which what is produced as artifice becomes the reality of
experience.

In a 2017 Facebook promo video for a new virtual reality technology,
Mark Zuckerberg and his colleague Rachel Frank tele-transported
themselves to Puerto Rico after a devastating flood. They intended to
showcase the potential of the new technology, but instead revealed its
inherent violence. The ability to transport oneself to faraway places
"as if" one's body were present gives the illusion that one we can make
a difference in the world through technology. Another example, in a
different register of colonial modernity is that way Western museums
allow visitors to \"transport\" themselves by observing objects looted
from elsewhere, like the Pergamon Museum in Berlin where museumgoers can
roam around the Ishtar Gate, which has been on display in the museum
since 1930. In a section of Ariella Azoulay's video Undocumented:
Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2020), she films actual visitors to the
Pergamon while noting that dislocation is the essence of (imperial)
modernity. The VR museum visitor is at the center of a world, but they
are not really there (an effect similar to the dispositive of
perspective in painting). For globalized Western culture, the ground for
vision, enlightenment, culture, and even social change is the
dislocation and disappearance of bodies.

Disembodiment and dislocation are also fundamental epistemological
premises of transhumanist Silicon Valley ideology. In this ideology, the
teleology of secular modern individualism culminates in the uploading of
a person's mind to a new biological, artificial, or
biological-artificial body. The utopian goal of expanding and preserving
human consciousness is physically and spiritually achieved.
Transhumanism is the dream of enhancing the human body through
technology, and ultimately escaping human suffering by transcending the
"errors" of death and aging.

Posthumanism takes things a step further: its goal is to immortalize
consciousness by uploading it to a robotic or synthetic body.
Posthumanism does away with the biological dimension of the self,
fundamentally altering what it means to be "human." In both trans- and
posthumanism, technology promises to give us the divine attributes of
omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience, making humans into "pure
consciousness," achieving a kind of individual and secular
transcendence. In the first episode of the British TV series Years and
Years (2019), Bethany, an adolescent whose face is hidden behind a 3D
emoji mask, announces to her parents that she is "transhuman." She
declares: "I don't want to be flesh. I want to escape this thing and
become digital, I want to live forever as information." Eventually
Bethany becomes a hero with transhuman superpowers: her mechanized eyes
and brain, which are connected to all the data in the world, allow her
to make visible the horrors that the British government have perpetrated
in a refugee camp. This techno-utopian narrative implies a democratic
ideology, insofar as one political goal of democracy is to make visible
the ordeals of oppressed minorities---in this case through virtual
disembodiment.

In contrast to this techno-utopian narrative, science
fiction---especially cyberpunk literature--- generally portrays
transhumanism as a nightmarish apocalyptic scenario of social control
and individual subjection. Several episodes of Black Mirror do this, for
example. But what Black Mirror and Years and Years have in common is
that technological advances and the increasing symbiosis between humans
and machines are associated with political, economic, and social
instability. In reality, "mind uploading" has attracted millions of
dollars of investment from the billionaires of Silicon Valley and
beyond. In a mixture of engineering and enlightenment, consciousness is
now being hacked through biofeedback techniques, meditation practices,
and microdosing drugs. Many critics have observed that the utopian
ideology of transhumanism underpins the Valley's culture of "move fast,
break things, and make as much money as possible." Technologies aiming
to expand human consciousness are rooted in purely extractivist,
capitalist values. In this sense, cybernetics is a political project on
a planetary scale. As described by Tiqqun, cybernetics is a gigantic
"abstract machine" made up of binary machines deployed by empire, and a
form of political sovereignty that has merged with the capitalist
extractivist project.

In the pre-cybernetic era---that is to say, before the 1940s---machines
were intended to emulate humans; their actions resembled human behavior,
but ostensibly without intent or emotions. This is why Donna Haraway
describes pre-cybernetic machines as "haunted." They seemed animated by
ghosts, reminiscent of Walter Benjamin's automaton that was inhabited by
a hunchbacked dwarf. Machines were not self-moving, self-designing, or
autonomous. They could not achieve human dreams, only mock them. In
turn, humans related to machines by using or acting upon them: switching
them on or off, using them as tools to achieve an end. Today, the
relationship between human and machine is based on internal, mutual
communication in a feedback loop. Early machines were led; today,
machines lead us. This does not mean that machines have simply become
humanized through the proliferation of androids. Rather, [humans have
**surrendered consciousness** to AI]{.underline}, [becoming **obedient**
and **predictable**]{.underline}. In the twenty-first century, machines
have blurred the distinction between the artificial and human mind, not
only because machines can imitate human functions, but because [humans
have become **increasingly passive**]{.underline}, [since we are now
subject to **neuropower**]{.underline}.

Within the cybernetic episteme, [it is no longer enough to talk about
a]{.underline} "**[control society]{.underline}**"; [we must talk
instead about a composite of **interlinked forms of
oppression**]{.underline} (exploitation, alienation, and domination),
[in tandem with]{.underline} extreme securitarianism. Another way to see
the cybernetic episteme is as [the reconceptualization of social worlds
into **information-processing systems**]{.underline}. Practices of
computation are used to produce new organizational and infrastructural
apparatuses, which in turn create value and profit by exploiting and
disposing of human life. [Social worlds are **subsumed** into
technologies]{.underline} through techniques such as statistical
forecasting and data modeling.

The cybernetic episteme stems from a world brought into being by
Europeans; this world began with the discovery of the "new world" and
the creation of empires and colonies (which coincided with the
scientific revolution). In this sense, [the cybernetic episteme is
**inseparable** from the **Western civilizing project** for the whole
world]{.underline}, which connected disparate places through
technologies like the telegraph and steam shipping, often powered by the
extraction of fossil fuels like coal. [This project has culminated
in]{.underline} globalization as [the **deregulation** and
**financialization** of world economies]{.underline}.

The Western civilization project, based on Enlightenment values
including equality, peaceful public life, access to modern science, the
rule of law, democracy, and technological progress, involved the
creation of infrastructure to unify nations and the world. [We can call
this]{.underline} infrastructure [the]{.underline}
"**[technosphere]{.underline}**." The technosphere comprises [not only
digital technology but all]{.underline} machines, factories, computers,
cars, buildings, railways, and mobility [infrastructure]{.underline}, as
well as systems of [food production]{.underline}, [resource
extraction]{.underline}, [and energy distribution]{.underline}. Today,
the infrastructure of the world---[the technosphere]{.underline}---[is
shaped by information]{.underline}, which means that the world we
inhabit is designed by data.

The technosphere is a supplement humans have created to help overcome
the limits of "human nature" insofar as humans cannot live independently
from structures geared towards sustaining life. [The technosphere has
promised to enable us to]{.underline} increase production and
reproduction with less human effort. Moreover, the technosphere is also
regarded as the main tool humans have to **[fight decay]{.underline}**,
**[entropy]{.underline}**, [and **death**]{.underline}, since it
comprises all the structures humans have built to keep themselves alive
on the planet. [The total mass of [the technosphere]{.mark} amounts
to]{.underline} fifty kilos for every square meter of earth's
surface---a total of **[thirty trillion tons]{.underline}**, [which
[coexists with the **diminishing hydrosphere**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(water, the frozen polar regions) [[and]{.mark} the
**[biosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline} (all of earth's living organisms).
[[The]{.mark} ultimate [price]{.mark}]{.underline} of the technosphere
[[is]{.mark} **global warming** and **environmental
[devastation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like humans, the technosphere needs
external energy input, which is not sustainable as long as it comes from
fossil fuels that will eventually be depleted.

From this standpoint, the cybernetic episteme represents the gradual
merging of human activity into the activity of what we have built and
surrounded ourselves with. Much of this built environment is invisible.
Infrastructure and data are partially occult because we are alienated
from them, even as we are produced and managed by them. The invisible
infrastructure that sustains our lives is what matters politically right
now. And insofar as the technosphere is cybernetic, it is inextricable
from capitalism and politics.

Human [[communication is at the **center**]{.mark} of the cybernetic
global order]{.underline}. The neural system of globalized networked
society is digital communication. In a 1975 film called Comment ça va?,
Anne-Marie Miéville and Jean-Luc Godard discuss the "illness" of
information. They begin with an image of the Carnation Revolution in
Portugal, published in the leftist newspaper Libération. At the time,
photojournalistic images had begun to proliferate as a form of
information, and Godard and Miéville critique Libération (the most
left-wing newspaper in Europe in those days) for failing to include the
reader in the creation and dissemination of information. They ask: "How
is it that things enter and exit the machine?" (Comment ça va de
l'entrée à la sortie de la machine?). [This question is about how
ideas]{.underline}, [words]{.underline},
[[discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}, [human interaction]{.underline}, and
images [**[become info]{.mark}rmation** and then reach
readers]{.underline} and viewers.

In Comment ça va?, mass media represents an illness that has killed
communication and language. Last year, Godard updated his critique of
the media in an interview posted to Instagram. He stated: "Plato's cave
has been fixed on paper/screen." For Godard, [the consequence of [the
becoming-information of]{.mark} communication and [language]{.mark} is
the **loss of ambiguity**]{.underline} in communication. Digital
technology has infiltrated every aspect of existence, and [the margin of
error between the transmission and the reception of a message has been
**eliminated**]{.underline} by mediatization and digitization. For
Godard, [digital communication]{.underline} denies the force of the
image or the word because it [[eliminates]{.mark}
**redundancy**]{.underline}, **[misunderstanding]{.underline}**, the
possibility of reading between the lines, [and [the **possibility of
alterity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In a more recent film of his---Adieu au language from 2014---Godard
suggests that digital media have destroyed face-to-face communication.
He asks: What kind of self could emerge in a time when objects and
bodies are disfigurable and refigurable through virtual manipulation?
Godard posits that [the **origins of**]{.underline} today's
[**totalitarianism** can be traced to the **interruption of interior
experience** by the spectacle]{.underline}. In the film, Godard features
a lengthy quote from Philippe Sollers explaining that the spectacle
"cuts off" the subject from its interior life---a process that is,
paradoxically, highly seductive. Furthermore, for Godard [[digital
communication creates]{.mark} a new form of **isolated
[solitude]{.mark}** [where]{.mark} people lack ties to
others]{.underline}. In this light, technology has not become an
extension of man, as Marshall McLuhan predicted, but has instead
attained autonomy from man, since digital media can communicate amongst
themselves without human mediation. For Godard, this means that
[the]{.underline} "[face-to-face]{.underline}"
[encounter]{.underline}---a basic form of human relation that is [[the
**foundation of ethics**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[is **no longer
possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist and sociologist, comes to similar
conclusions: daily conversations no longer involve eye contact, and
face-to-face discussion has been replaced by words on a screen.
According to Turkle, texts, tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram messages,
and Snapchats split our attention and diminish our capacity for empathy.
They have created new codes of etiquette; no longer do we feel
restrained from reaching for our phones in the presence of other people.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} new etiquette [[entrenches]{.mark} a culture
of [**individualism** and **isolation**]{.mark}]{.underline} from each
other. [This]{.underline} isolation [cultivates [the **perfect ground
for fascism**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The [digitization]{.underline} of communication [not only has political
and communal consequences]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} also [affects the
**neuroplastic potential** of the]{.mark} living
[brain]{.mark}]{.underline}. The cybernetic episteme reshapes our
working memory by rearranging its contents. As Warren Neidich writes,
[the new focus]{.underline} of power [is]{.underline} not only the false
reproduction of the past (the manipulation of the archive), but [the
manipulation of our]{.underline} working memory---the type of memory
that influences our **[decision-making]{.underline}**. [Authoritarian
neuropower wants **nothing less**]{.underline} than to shape our future
memory, argues Neidich.

If the nervous system of cybernetics is digital communication, at the
center of digital communication is desire. Mark Fisher devoted his last
lectures at Goldsmiths in 2017 to this subject. During one lecture, he
played for his students a famous Apple TV commercial from 1984, directed
by Ridley Scott and originally broadcast during the Superbowl. In an
overt reference to George Orwell's novel 1984, the commercial depicts a
dreary, repressive control society. This society is seemingly liberated
when a buxom blonde woman tosses a sledgehammer at a large screen
broadcasting the image of an authoritarian figure, causing the screen to
explode. The commercial ends with these lines crawling across the
screen: "On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And
you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984." Fisher observes that the video
counterposes top-down bureaucratic control to upstart
entrepreneurialism. The dreary control society depicted in the
commercial is an allusion to not only the Soviet Union, but also IBM,
the dominant computer maker at the time. Apple posits itself as the
dynamic, colorful new company that will liberate society from dreary
IBM, ushering in a new, more vibrant world order. This new world order
will fulfill our (capitalist) desires in a way that the communist world
cannot. As Fisher suggests, we now live in that world of libidinal
capitalism.

Elsewhere Fisher writes that what drives the circulation of information
is the user's desire to make one more connection, to leave one more
reply, to keep on clicking. Capitalism persists because cyberspace is
already under our skin, writes Fisher; to retreat from it would be like
trying to retreat into some nonexistent precapitalist imaginary. In his
view, we believe we have as much a chance of escaping capitalism as we
do of crawling back inside our mother's womb.

By means of the cybernetic episteme, Silicon Valley has shaped the world
we all live in. As we are poisoned equally by microplastics and fake
news, losing our grasp of a shared reality, the "Silicon Six"---as Sacha
Baron Cohen called the titans of Silicon Valley in a 2019
speech---propagate algorithm-fueled fear, propaganda, lies, and hate in
the name of profit. As Baron Cohen pointed out, the major online
platforms largely avoid the kind of regulation and accountability that
other media companies are subject to. "This is ideological imperialism,"
he said. "Six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley impos\[e\] their
vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government, and
acting as if they are above the law." He called digital platforms the
greatest propaganda machine in history.

[Democratic institutions have **failed to reign in** the information
chaos and the destruction of the public sphere]{.underline}. As Shoshana
Zuboff argues, [we inhabit a communications sphere that is **no longer a
public sphere**]{.underline}. She describes this situation as an
"epistemic coup" that has taken place in four stages: First, by way of
companies gathering personal data about us and then claiming it as their
own private property. Second, through data inequality, which means that
companies know more than we do. Third, through the epistemic chaos
created by algorithms. And fourth, through the institutionalization of
this new episteme and the erosion of democratic governance.

Baron Cohen observes that [people can take a stand against platforms by
recognizing our power to **boycott** them]{.underline}. (One example is
the mass defection from WhatsApp to Telegram when the former announced
that would share its user data with Facebook.) [But [we]{.mark} also
[need to]{.mark}]{.underline} defend the existence of facts and a shared
reality, [[understand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the world **not** as
something we **see** but as something we
**inhabit**]{.underline}]{.mark}---treating life not as something we
have, but as something we live. [Anti-platform strategies]{.underline}
might be accused of Luddism, but they [are **not necessarily opposed**
to technology]{.underline}---[only]{.underline} to **[certain
uses]{.underline}** of technology.

[[It is]{.mark} also [**crucial** that we regard the cybernetic episteme
as]{.mark} **inextricable** from a broader malaise]{.underline}:
[humanity's relationship to **life** and the **planet** is]{.underline}
a **[toxic]{.underline}** one. The very [technologies]{.underline} that
supposedly enable us to read, think, flourish, and desire [are
**[destroying the world]{.mark}**]{.underline} we inhabit.

#### Vote negative to [rearticulate]{.underline} cybernetic thought towards [corporeal care of the subject]{.underline}.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko, 19**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, "What Is to Be Done?," *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital
Subterfuge in Global Capitalism*, Chapter 3, 158-161, dml)

While tactical resistance can involve any and all of the "memes of
production" (Deterritorial Support Group 2012), a reconstitution of the
left today must ask, what is the opposite of cyberwar? To this, we would
answer that [the antithesis of cyberwar is **corporeal care of the
subject** achieved through the]{.underline} "[balanced conceptions of
space and time within culture]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[awareness of]{.underline} spatial and temporal [dynamics]{.underline}
\[[that]{.underline}\] [keep state and market power in
check]{.underline}" (Sharma 2013, 314). It is from this perspective that
[we need to recognize cyberwar's production of time and space and
envision different times and spaces]{.underline}---those [of the **care
of bodies**]{.underline}. [This orientation]{.underline} against the
social destruction, physical, psychological, and infrastructural, of
cyberwar [does not mean **totally abandoning** the
digital]{.underline}---[which]{.underline}, because it so much composes
the very texture of everyday life, [would be not only **difficult** but
often **politically fatal**]{.underline}. But [it does mean its
**rearticulation** to a set of purposes **radically different** from
those of digital capital]{.underline}. In particular, [this]{.underline}
strategy [requires **theoretical reconsideration** and **practical
subversion**]{.underline} of the addicted, complicit digital user, the
figure envisioned by neoliberal Silicon Valley, [by way of]{.underline}
desynchronization and emancipation.

This can be described as [recognizing a position **in** and **against**
the military environment of cyberwar in which all of us are now
imbricated and finding ways to **develop subjectivities** that are
simultaneously **of** the network and **off** the network]{.underline}.
[It requires the]{.underline} "**[slow]{.underline}**" [time necessary
for the **in-person**]{.underline} ([rather than
**online**]{.underline}) [organization of **antiwar
collectives**]{.underline}, **[movements]{.underline}**, [and
**alliances**]{.underline}; defection from compulsive social media use;
trammeling corporate capacities to intensify and maintain such addictive
behavior; [the **patient defense** and **reconstruction** of the basic
public institutions of corporeal care]{.underline}---free health
services; the cultivation of mental health; [the recovery and deepening
of the]{.underline} legacy of a semidestroyed (or, in many places, never
created) **[welfare state]{.underline}** in a new "commonfare";
[**universal education** provisions]{.underline}; [**worker--community
control** of workplaces and the means of production]{.underline};
**[ecological protections]{.underline}**---[and the assertion of such
priorities **against** the expense and logic of **networked
militarization**]{.underline}. [In this work of solidarity]{.underline},
[the subject **exploited** and **excommunicated** by digital capitalism
can transition from **alienation** toward **reciprocity**]{.underline}.
And [to those who say that the accelerated logic of cyberwar means we
**don't have time** to do all this before catastrophe
arrives]{.underline}, we just say, **[you may be right]{.underline}**,
**[but still we have to do it anyway!]{.underline}** We can build a
"counterwar machine" constructed on the diagonal line that runs between
waging cyberwar on cyberwar and fostering the caring corporeality that
is opposite of cyberwar.

At the end of her study of world labor activism, Beverly Silver (2003,
176) notes a major reason for the shortage of militant working-class
movements in the early twenty-first century. Neoliberalism's
restructuring, globalization, and financialization, with its "growing
structural unemployment, escalating inequalities and major disruptions,"
has repeated the crisis patterns of previous eras of capitalism, with
one crucial exception. The missing condition is large-scale armed
conflict. This "global political--military context contrasts sharply
with . . . that \[which\] produced radicalized and explosive labour
unrest in the first half of the twentieth century." As Silver notes, war
then involved the mass mobilization of populations that characterized
total war. States depended on their working classes to provide not just
millions of soldiers but labor in munition plants, shipyards and
aircraft factories, hospitals, and farms. When mass mobilization met the
horror of mass deaths and mutilation, revolutionary social turmoil could
result.

As Silver (2003, 175) observes, advanced capitalism's turn to high
technological weaponry apparently breaks this link between war and
worker revolt. Cyberwar can be seen as an extension of
[this]{.underline} "**[automation of war]{.underline}**." Nonetheless,
as we have suggested, the tendency of digital militarization to
liquidate the labor of war [is **not yet completely
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Humans remain as the **indispensable
conscious links** and **relays** within the networks and nodes of
digital conflict]{.underline}. Indeed, what [we have seen]{.underline}
in this book is [the **surprisingly wide diffusion** of
participation]{.underline} in cyberwarfare, from the highly specialized
military and intelligence units at the cutting edge of advanced
cyberoperations to strata of mercenary and criminal proxies, online
vigilantes, patriotic hackers, corporate and criminal marketers of
cyberweaponry, cybersecurity personnel, and on to the corporate content
moderators and state censors and surveillance agents now indispensable
to the prosecution of war waged in cyberspace and across scores of
hybrid battlefields. To these more or less intentional contributions to
the mechanisms of cyberwar must be added [the]{.underline} unknowing (or
partially unknowing) [participation of network users]{.underline}, whose
online activities and addictions [provide the **vital vectors**
for]{.underline} the memes, exploits, and hijackings of [subterranean
cyberconflicts]{.underline} and whose reconstitution as data-subjects
habituated to ceaseless state and commercial surveillance constitutes
the inevitable accompaniment to such operations.

Surveying this field, we can say that military mobilization has not so
much been abolished from cyberwar as reconfigured in subterranean,
etiolated, and unfamiliar forms. This decomposition of the labor of war,
equivalent to Virilio's state of "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**"
[by the apparatus of high-technology militarism]{.underline},
[may]{.underline}, as we have proposed in this chapter, [contain
potentials for **reversal**]{.underline}. If, to date, cyberwar is not,
at least in the centers of capitalism, producing the massive havoc of
earlier forms of war, the migrant refugees of hybrid conflicts around
the world, fleeing algorithmically directed drones, social
media--activated death squads, and cybernetic strikes at social
utilities, bear witness to its potential to do so.
[Already]{.underline}, [even in ostensibly secure zones of the
planet]{.underline}, [the costs of militarized and criminalized
networks]{.underline}, [in terms of **escalating social
paranoias**]{.underline}, [**crumbling confidence** in everyday
communication and **polarizing social relations**]{.underline}, [becomes
daily more apparent]{.underline}. [If this]{.underline} course
[persists]{.underline}, [**unforeseen forms of unrest** by the new
workforces of cyberwar may **interrupt** its inhuman
trajectory]{.underline}.

### Impact Framing---2NC

#### When comparing impacts, you should [artificially inflate]{.underline} the value of our algorithmic violence impacts because doing so promotes [more exposure]{.underline} and [better scholarship]{.underline}. Their impact defense is [epistemologically bankrupt]{.underline} because it [can't account]{.underline} for the pervasiveness of datafication.

**Ragazzi and Irion, 21**---Associate Professor in International
Relations at the Institute of Political Science, Leiden University;
Associate Professor at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the
University of Amsterdam (Francesco and Kristina, "Toward a Critique of
Algorithmic Violence," International Political Sociology (2021) 15,
121--150, dml)

[I would like]{.underline} in this short intervention [to address one of
the **key paradoxes** of algorithmic violence]{.underline} as sketched
in the introduction of this article. **[Surveillance]{.underline}**,
**[security]{.underline}**, [and **war apparatuses**]{.underline},
[empowered through modern digital technologies]{.underline}, [have
**never** been so pervasive]{.underline} as they are today (Bauman et
al. 2014). [At the same time]{.underline}, [**rarely** has such a
precise and overarching degree of surveillance been able to **impose
itself without violence** on the broader population]{.underline} (Zuboff
2019). Comparisons of digital surveillance with the years of the
communist East German Stasi or the Romanian Securitate are somewhat
unconvincing: our contemporary condition, in modern democracies, is a
far cry from the level of generalized fear and suspicion that prevailed
in those dictatorships. In democracies, [algorithmic security is
implemented with a **great degree of indifference**]{.underline} at
best, active volunteering of personal data and "DIY surveillance" at
worst (Bauman and Lyon 2013, 59). [There are]{.underline}, of course,
[**small pockets of contestation** among academics]{.underline}, [human
rights organizations]{.underline}, [and activists]{.underline}. [But
their impact has been]{.underline}, **[so far]{.underline}**,
**[marginal]{.underline}**. **[Occasionally]{.underline}**, [the
opposition to practices of algorithmic violence gains
popularity]{.underline}, [crystalizing around the use of **specific
technologies**]{.underline}. Advocacy groups have, for example, been
successful in mobilizing against facial recognition in the context of
the recent demonstrations against police brutality in the United States
(Coldewey 2020; Fowler 2020). [But **overall**]{.underline}, [for the
**general public**]{.underline}, [including many critical academics and
activists]{.underline}, Gmail, Yahoo, YouTube, Google Docs, Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype are [services]{.underline} that [bear
**no apparent connection** with]{.underline} CIA [**terrorist kill
lists** and **drone operations**]{.underline} in Afghanistan--Pakistan
(Heller 2013), **[databases]{.underline}** of alleged "radicalized"
individuals in Europe (Heath-Kelly 2016), [or **surveillance
mechanisms**]{.underline} deployed in the south of the Mediterranean to
prevent undocumented migrants from reaching Europe (Fisher 2018).

Irion: I would like to add that for the purpose of serving online ads to
internet users the adtech industry has built the largest online
surveillance infrastructure in history. [How could an entire industry be
allowed to **spiral out of control**]{.underline}, invade and trespass
[to **such a pervasive degree**]{.underline} on individuals' online
lives, thereby [increasingly refining their algorithmically supported
infrastructures?]{.underline} I believe [one of the reasons is the
**invisibility** and **secrecy** of the violence and our **lack of
imagination**]{.underline}. Zuboff (2019, 12) explains that "[\[w\]hen
we encounter something **unprecedented**]{.underline}, [we
**automatically interpret** it through the lenses of **familiar
categories**]{.underline}, thereby [rendering **invisible** precisely
that which is **unprecedented**]{.underline}." [Endemic online
surveillance is emblematic for the **enduring regulatory crisis** in
information law and policy]{.underline}, [which is]{.underline} moreover
[**ill equipped** to scrutinize algorithmic systems]{.underline}.

There are many reasons behind this disconnect. [Even though]{.underline}
the Snowden [revelations have **highlighted**]{.underline} clear
relations between [these]{.underline} two [realities]{.underline}, [and
even though several academic and advocacy projects **work relentlessly**
to publicize the relations between them]{.underline}, [most people chose
to **ignore** them]{.underline}, [because of]{.underline}, lack of
technical skills, convenience, or network effects. But I would like to
suggest that there is [a **further fundamental reason**]{.underline},
[of an **epistemological nature**]{.underline}. [Algorithmic violence is
**largely accepted** because]{.underline} unlike the various modes of
state surveillance and violence of the past, [it is]{.underline} for the
most part invisible, inaudible and [**impalpable** for the **vast
majority** of people]{.underline}. [Algorithmic violence is]{.underline}
indeed [located not only in the acts of collecting or processing
data]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather [in the technical operations
of **translation**]{.underline} (Goodwin 1994, Bourne, Johnson, and
Lisle 2015) [that **render the world computable**]{.underline}. On the
one hand, these are the operations of datafication, that is, of
transformation of the world captured through various sensors into
computational data (Aradau and Blanke 2015). On the other hand, it is
located in operations of textualization, visualization, auralization, or
tactilization, that is, operations that translate those computational
products back into discursive [and]{.underline} sensorial outputs that
[can be **acted upon** by professionals of **security** and
**warfare**]{.underline}. Saugmann has captured this idea in the notion
of semiotic violence in his above intervention. It is [this]{.underline}
specific characteristic that [renders algorithmic violence **largely
intangible** to scrutiny because it **escapes our traditional
categories** of]{.underline} social scientific [**knowledge production**
and thus **political mobilization**]{.underline}. We know indeed how to
study data collection. [We know how to study
**algorithms**]{.underline}. [But we know **very little** about how to
study those operations of **translation** that allow]{.underline}
discourse, images, sounds, and [data to be **computed** and **made
actionable**]{.underline}.

### Alt Solvency---2NC

#### The alternative starts with the ballot to [reorient]{.underline} the production of cybernetic thought in [this]{.underline} debate towards care for the [corporeal]{.underline}, [embodied]{.underline}, [un-quantifiable subject]{.underline}. Even academics have a role to play; prioritizing [research]{.underline} that enables the [slow]{.underline}, [patient process]{.underline} of building communities of care and reciprocity [spills up]{.underline} in unpredictable ways and [challenges]{.underline} the encroachment of the cybernetic episteme, that's Dyer-Witheford. The [essence]{.underline} of the cybernetic episteme is that it requires a [constant flow of data]{.underline} from [every source it can find]{.underline} to sustain itself, so you should [assume]{.underline} that even small disruptions in that flow, like using your ballot to [redirect]{.underline} the research priorities of [this]{.underline} debate, can have [broader]{.underline} political significance.

#### The alt functions at two levels:

#### Individually. Have a low threshold for alt solvency; we're all so imbricated in the digital moment that individual moments of refusal [on their own]{.underline} can become generative points for new relationships of care.

[The answer]{.underline} to our problems [does not lie in
**primitivism**]{.underline} or any other return to a (mythical) better
past. [We are **here**]{.underline}; [we need to find ways to **deal**
with now if we are to **rescue the future**]{.underline}. [The
answer]{.underline}, equally, [does not solely lie in
**reform**]{.underline}. Rather, [we need to ask **what we want our
societies to look like**]{.underline}---and here we can look to the past
for some ideas without returning to it. In short, [we need to foster
**new forms of collectivity**]{.underline} in the maze of individualism
and individualisation. [This requires **radical new formulations** of
subjectivity that take into account our contemporary
situation]{.underline}. Like Bartleby, [it might consist of **a
preference not to**]{.underline}, which is [neither **refusal** nor
**acceptance**]{.underline}: [it simply]{.underline} "**[posits an
impossibility]{.underline}**" (Deleuze 1997, 71). [This]{.underline}
impossibility or nonpreference [produces a **tension**]{.underline}, an
ambiguity [that creates a path for **escaping the neurosis** of the
world]{.underline}. That is, [the **little fissure** it creates gives
way to a mapping of trajectories **away** from subjugated groups and
towards new types of group subjects that **do not merely concede** to
the present]{.underline}, either in terms of an eschatology of
techno-singularitarianism or hikimomori-style withdrawal. For Guattari,
this involves processes of resingularisation, where singularisation
refers to

a self-organizing process that at its most basic level concerns bringing
together ensembles of diverse components (material/semiotic;
individual/collective), that is, assemblages ... that deploy their own
intrinsic references (inventing relations with the outside as well), and
the analysis of their effects (especially transformations) on the
formation of subjectivity beyond the individuated subject and
prefabricated versions of him/her. (Genosko 2001, 129)

Far from the homophile groups of online life, this requires, as Guattari
foresaw, an injection of heterogeneity where individuals can be
confronted with ideas dissimilar from their own and opportunities to
talk this through rather than reactively cancelling 27 someone. It
requires forms of offline life that nurture transgenerational,
intergenerational, interpersonal, personal and pre-personal
long-circuits in order to reach the Neganthropocene, a place of dreams.
As Stiegler puts it:

we must turn to the question of the dream in politics and the question
of the politics of dreaming---where dreams would be the resource of any
neganthropogenesis, that is, any exosomatic organogenesis such that it
would preserve its future by maintaining its noetic capacity. (Stiegler
2019, 162)

[These new social practices of liberation]{.underline}---yes, of
dreaming---[cannot be based on **new hierarchical
relations**]{.underline}. Instead, [one of the **main goals** needs to
be the creation of **new alliances**]{.underline}, a transversal
politics, "[that confers to these initiatives a character of **living
subjectivation** and **irreplaceable experience**]{.underline},
[that]{.underline} '[is **worth being lived**]{.underline}',
[that]{.underline} '**[gives meaning to life]{.underline}**'" (Guattari
and Negri 2010, 125). In short, we are looking for health.
Interestingly, for Deleuze and Guattari, as for Nietzsche before them,
health is not opposed to illness; rather it is the "immanent process
whereby illness brings about its own autocritique and self-overcoming"
(Tynan 2010, 155). The illness of our time therefore needs to be
transmuted in order to create new ways of living again---and this is of
course the schizoanalytic practice. [The aim is to see our current
algorithmic articulations as a
**pharmakon**]{.underline}---[that]{.underline}, precisely, [is
**Bartleby's stance**]{.underline}. It is a productive paradox, an
affirmation of life and the future, rather than a negation of it.
Importantly, though, it is

only with the pharmakon that knowledge takes care of the pharmakon ...
the whole manifold of life-knowledge---which passes through rituals as
well as habitus, trades and forms of worship \[cultes\] that are found
in any society insofar as it consists in a social cohesion that is a
collective individuation, cultivating, through these always diverse
pathways, the organic and organological solidarity in which it consists.
(Stiegler 2019, 224)

The individualist, [individualising societies]{.underline} we currently
find ourselves in [have]{.underline} not only [**lost**
their]{.underline} means of tertiary protention, but a [memory
of]{.underline} what [a society]{.underline} is and can be: that [which
allows the **development** and **co-creation** of individual and social
freedom]{.underline}; [where]{.underline} material [goods are
produced]{.underline} in order [to meet the]{.underline} physical [needs
of **everyone**]{.underline} in a society, [rather than satisfy the
**insatiable requirements** of capitalism]{.underline}; [where **free**
and **equal** social relationships are fostered]{.underline} so that
people can flourish mentally and emotionally and, in turn, develop their
ethical and creative capacities.28 [If this is the **basis** of our
society]{.underline}, [algorithms would have a **very different
function** and that]{.underline}, we hold, [is **more important than
reform**]{.underline}.

#### Politically. Don't assume that nation-states are the [only]{.underline} agents capable of making international change, or that debate can't be repurposed [just like other technologies]{.underline}. At a macro-political scale, the alt's reorientation of cybernetic thought envisions [governable stack-layers]{.underline} of [collectively designed]{.underline} data architectures in line with [transnational networks]{.underline} of [insurgent democratic digital sovereignty]{.underline}.

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

**[Sovereignty need not be solely the purview of nation
states]{.underline}**. [The discourse of digital sovereignty has been
particularly important among **indigenous communities** whose members
are used to seeing their pre-digital sovereignty effaced]{.underline};
[they have developed **governable stack-layers** such as **tribal
broadband lines**]{.underline} (Blackwater 2020),
**[cryptocurrencies]{.underline}** (Tekobbe and McKnight 2016), **[data
governance]{.underline}** (Carroll et al. 2020), [and **linguistic
autonomy**]{.underline} (Pinto 2018). Amelia Winger-Bearskin (2020)
draws on the Haudenosaunee practice of wampum agreements to propose
"**[ethical dependencies]{.underline}**" in software; these [would
encode and enforce certain commitments **up** and **down the
stack**]{.underline}. [Laying claim to collective
sovereignty]{.underline} is central to such practices. Glen Sean
Coulthard (2014) [**challenges** the]{.underline} "**[colonial politics
of recognition]{.underline}**" -- [when people accept their
**colonisers' definition** of their sovereignty]{.underline}, [rather
than their **own**]{.underline} -- [to insist on **more autonomous
forms** of self-determination]{.underline}. He describes how tribal
nations can produce sovereignty through "community-scale activities"
such as cooperatives and assemblies in everyday life (68). The
indigenous organiser Berta Cáceres, before her murder by Honduran
paramilitaries, denounced the pseudo-democracy of political
representatives but affirmed the "decisive" democracy possible through
poor people's movements (Castellanos and Pine 2020).

[Sovereignty can occur at levels ranging from the **network backbone**
to **last-mile connections**]{.underline}, [up through the **hardware**
and **software** of devices]{.underline}, [to the **collaboration
tools** in the cloud]{.underline}. [Sovereignty looks like a
**user-owned cooperative** or a **city providing
connectivity**]{.underline}, [or like **Douglass**]{.underline}
(douglass.io), an operating system whose apps take their names from
icons of Black liberation. The tech publication The Markup has paid
[a]{.underline} "**[privacy tax]{.underline}**" by developing its own
software that protects user data rather than adopting the standard
surveillance-based offerings (Angwin 2020). For **[Archive of Our
Own]{.underline}** (archiveofourown.org), a fan-run fandom repository,
sovereignty puts creators in control of how they publish and protects
their work against copyright overreach. [What makes technology sovereign
is when its stewards are the **people** who depend on it]{.underline},
[**protected** from outside control]{.underline} by any legal or
extra-legal means available. [The data]{.underline}, [the
algorithms]{.underline}, [and the interfaces are **for** their
users]{.underline}, [rather than acting surreptitiously **against**
them]{.underline}.

5.2. Democracy

[The other side]{.underline} of sovereignty [is participatory
democracy]{.underline} -- its guarantor and its everyday practice. Here
[we **resist** the temptation of **autocratic vanguardism** by designing
governable stacks to be **accountable** and **alive**]{.underline}. [The
style of democracy may be that of the **Debian operating
system**]{.underline}, [a constitutional republic of coders]{.underline}
(debian.org/devel/constitution), [or like the **Ethical Source
Movement's vision** of many collectives deciding on the ethical limits
of how their software can be used]{.underline} (ethicalsource.dev).
[Digital democracy is beginning to have dedicated tools]{.underline} --
[from smaller-group decisions on **Loomio**]{.underline} (loomio.org)
[to the scale of cities or countries through **Barcelona's
Decidim**]{.underline} (decidim.org) [or **Polis**]{.underline}
(pol.is), which is employed [by]{.underline} the government of
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** (Stempeck 2020). [Platform cooperatives
practice democracy at the level of the company]{.underline}, [such as at
**Stocksy**]{.underline} United (stocksy.com), co-owned by artists in
dozens of countries (Schneider 2018). [On a network scale]{.underline},
the federated social network [**Mastodon** was able to counteract an
incursion by]{.underline} the alt-right platform **[Gab]{.underline}**,
[as it did earlier with]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**slamic
**[S]{.underline}**tate accounts -- [through self-organised
activity]{.underline} by server administrators and app developers
(Caelin 2020). [Countering hate speech doesn't need to depend on the
might of a **global monopoly**]{.underline}; [it can be **tangible** and
**empowering**]{.underline}.

[Practices of local democracy from the Global South have been migrating
into **governable online tools**]{.underline}. [Participatory budgeting
practices originating from **Porto Alegre**]{.underline}, Brazil
(Cabannes 2004), [have appeared in]{.underline} apps like
**[Cobudget]{.underline}** (cobudget.co) [and **Decidim**]{.underline}.
A founder of an experimental political party in Argentina, **[Partido
Red]{.underline}**, [has applied the same logic]{.underline} of "liquid
democracy" [to a blockchain-based governance platform]{.underline},
**[Democracy Earth]{.underline}** (democracy.earth). **[Mexico
City's]{.underline}** 2016 [exercise in crowdsourcing its constitution
has]{.underline} been studied as [a **model around the
world**]{.underline}.

[Digital democracy has the potential to evolve **rapidly** and
**creatively**]{.underline}. [People can participate in **far more
rapid** and **fine-grained ways** than was possible when the prevailing
regimes of corporate and state governance first appeared]{.underline}.
Organisational [designs that work well could become part of a
**governance commons**]{.underline}, [enabling other groups to
**adopt**]{.underline}, **[adapt]{.underline}**, [and **share** them
back into the common pool]{.underline} (Schneider et al. 2021). In this
way, [small-scale accountability can **spread**]{.underline}, [and it
can creep into **larger** and **larger kinds** of
communities]{.underline}, [demonstrating that colonial control was
**never necessary**]{.underline}. **[The more we demand and practice the
arts of self-governing]{.underline}**, **[the harder we are for someone
else to govern]{.underline}**.

5.3. Insurgency

The spinning wheel stood for household autonomy, but it was also
defiance against British rule. [Governable stacks must be]{.underline}
similarly **[insurgent]{.underline}**. [Some of the earliest online
social media emerged through **Indymedia's coverage** of anti-capitalist
protests]{.underline}. [**Twitter** has its roots in technology for
coordinating street protests]{.underline} (Costanza-Chock 2020, Chapter
3). [While investors and accelerators receive frequent credit for
innovation]{.underline}, [insurgency is **just as much** a source of
it]{.underline}.

[Insurgency might mean challenging government subpoenas of member
data]{.underline}, [as **May First** has done]{.underline}, [or
facilitating leaks about abuses of power]{.underline}. [Resistance might
take the form of what the **Catalan Integral Cooperative**
calls]{.underline} "**[economic disobedience]{.underline}**"
(cooperativa.cat/economic-disobedience), [which includes refusing to pay
unjust taxes or interest]{.underline}. [Insurgents might choose not to
submit the data of a friendship to the social graphs of colonial
platforms]{.underline}, [or to actively deceive those
platforms]{.underline}, [just as the **Tor** network]{.underline}
(torproject.org) [disguises its users' locations]{.underline}. [Like
**Copwatch** groups or the **Driver's Seat Cooperative**]{.underline}
(driversseat.sco), [insurgents can do data collection on the
colonisers]{.underline}, **[sousveillance from below]{.underline}**
(Browne 2015).

To the extent that establishing the expansionist, slaveholding republic
of the United States was also an anticolonial conflict, it relied on
self-governance as resistance. The colonists organised through a
Continental Congress, which extracted lessons from the Haudenosaunee
nations -- yes to confederation, no to matriarchal authority -- to
prefigure a future government. After independence, Alexis de Tocqueville
(1840/2006) observed how the flourishing of civic associations energised
the politics of the fledgling republic. Successful poor people's
struggles against the country's wealthy elites, from the 19th-century
Populists (Goodwyn 1978) to the 20th-century movements for Black power
(Nembhard 2014), grew out of tangible collective organising in labour
unions and cooperatives.

[Insurgents might use colonial platforms for **education** and
**organising**]{.underline}. [They might **spread viral messages** and
**enjoy themselves**]{.underline}. [But if they have **governable
stacks** to go back to]{.underline}, [they are **more than just
subjects**]{.underline}. [They are **maroons**]{.underline}, [with
**swamps** and **forests** of their own]{.underline}.

### Framework Core---2NC

#### Counter-interpretation: The aff's research agenda should be a legitimate subject of negation.

#### Prefer the model that produces better researchers. Centering debates on link uniqueness and quantifiable solvency furthers the conversion of communication into [data]{.underline}, which is the [backbone]{.underline} of the cybernetic episteme, that's Emmelheinz. Only our model has [any]{.underline} hope of motivating debaters to mobilize outside the activity.

**Jackson, 20**---Professor and Head of Department, International
Education and Philosophy of Education, Education University of Hong Kong
(Liz, "'But is it really research?' mentoring students as theorists in
the era of cybernetic capitalism," Educational Philosophy and Theory,
2020, Vol. 52, No. 1, 17-21, dml) \[inserted "is" to correct a suspected
typo for grammatical integrity, insertion denoted by brackets\]

As Michael Peters notes (2017, 2018), in this age of '[cybernetic
capitalism]{.underline}', the global knowledge infrastructure
[is]{.underline} dominated by trillion-dollar multinationals. These
forces are [**reshaping** what counts as **valuable
knowledge**]{.underline}, [interpreting **academic significance** in
terms of the capacity of research to]{.underline} directly lead to
neoliberal market-oriented economic growth. An outgrowth of the rise of
the age of cybernetic capitalism is the increased valuation and
appreciation of big data over other kinds of evidence and bases for
knowledge. As Kenneth Neil Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger (2013)
have noted, the subsequent rise of big data as the most valued currency
can be characterised by 'the ability to **[render into
data]{.underline}** many [aspects of the world that have **never been
quantified** before]{.underline}'. To neoliberal institutions and
nation-states, which provide public and private information
infrastructure, such data is of tremendous use and power. Ordinary
[academics in this environment have tended to conform to capitalistic
**frameworks** of value]{.underline} in this case, working to gather and
analyse data [in ways that **benefit dominant**]{.underline} social
[**institutions** and]{.underline} political economic
**[actors]{.underline}**. Some may assume there is a mutual benefit, as
more funding will be granted, and greater significance ascribed, to
researchers gathering data that is of more value under neoliberal growth
models and agendas.

[Educational researchers]{.underline} are far from immune to these
pressures and these seductions. Major associations for educational
research such as the American Educational Research Association
[celebrate]{.underline} their connections with government funders such
as the National Science Foundation, which specifically funds
'scientific' [research that aims to have an **impact**]{.underline}. By
'impact', it is implied that [the research **must agree broadly** with
the **goals** of institutions and the **value** of forwarding
them]{.underline}, [**without major critique** or
**investigation**]{.underline}. By 'scientific', there is an emphasis on
data. While one might say, following Peter Roberts (2018), that all
research is informed by data, as it is 'generated through human
experience', in competitive environments [in the age of cybernetic
capitalism]{.underline} '**[more data]{.underline}**' [is]{.underline}
regarded as **[better]{.underline}** data. Quantitative data becomes
better than qualitative data, and so on.

[There is]{.underline} perhaps [**no more vital task** of]{.underline}
educational [theorists]{.underline} in this age [than to **understand**
and **examine**]{.underline} how economic growth models are shaping
**[knowledge production agendas]{.underline}**, as well as economic and
information distribution, normally to benefit the visions of leading
players in the age of cybernetic capitalism (Peters, 2017). Yet in this
context, it would appear that academics [researchers are **more
constrained than ever before** by these]{.underline} political-economic
[forces when it comes to producing research]{.underline}, [to be
accountable to]{.underline} higher educational
[institutions]{.underline} and other funding bodies [which follow the
lead of multinational giants]{.underline}. [Rather than **setting**
agendas]{.underline}, [most are **complying**]{.underline}, [seeing
little recourse and]{.underline} indeed [lacking tools that have become
**devalued** by]{.underline}, [or may even]{.underline} now [be regarded
as **inherently threatening** to]{.underline}, [the architects of
neoliberal structures that **frame information production agendas**
today]{.underline}.

In the context of ordinary higher education and research institutions,
with the ability to gather more data has come greater possibilities for
quantitative research. In education, as in other fields, [quantitative
research has retained a **favoured status** over qualitative and
philosophical approaches]{.underline} for decades. Maths and sciences
are still seen as the 'hard' and 'tough' sciences and fields, over the
'softer' arts. That this is senseless binary, particularly in education,
has been argued by many philosophers of education (Pring, 2007).
Qualitative researchers are not immune to the significance of numbers,
and quantitative researchers should not be looking at numbers to the
neglect of everything else. Yet today, one can see that [this binary
clearly does have a logic]{.underline}: [to **divide** and
**differentiate** research according to its value within the orientation
to the world undergirding cybernetic capitalism]{.underline}. In this
framing, educational [theory]{.underline}, with its focus on ideas,
[is]{.underline} even more of a loser than qualitative research, **[not
even deemed as research]{.underline}** by some [due to its lack
of]{.underline} big **[data]{.underline}**---[and]{.underline} lack of
**[neoliberal priorities]{.underline}**.

This is just the latest challenge educational theorists have faced in
defending their position in the academy, given the way their work does
not tend to fit perfectly with traditional conceptions of educational
research, or of applied philosophy (Roberts, 2018). Philosophers of
education have expressed for a long time a sense of a minority status in
teacher education institutions as well, which are normally focused
mostly on educational practice, and on training students in qualitative
and quantitative research methods. Philosophers and theorists may be
feel further crunched today, in education and other fields, as the
datafication era aligns with the push for competitive large-scale grants
in higher education, which also makes empirical and quantitative
research appeal more than ever before.

In this context, educational [theorists can do **more** than simply try
to **conform**]{.underline}, in vain. Instead, [they can take
responsibility to **question** neoliberal assumptions about value and
significance]{.underline}, [**interrogate** contemporary
political-economic influences on academic research]{.underline} and
social life, [and provide **alternative accounts** of what is
**good**]{.underline}, **[significant]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
'**[productive]{.underline}**'. As Roberts (2018) writes, [they
can]{.underline} also **[resist]{.underline}** 'some of [the demands of
a **performance-driven** world]{.underline}', for instance [by taking
time]{.underline} to pay attention to what is happening in their
institutions and in the field today: [**not** to be **pragmatic**
or]{.underline} '**[relevant]{.underline}**' [for the sake of developing
neoliberal]{.underline} '**[impact]{.underline}**', [but to
**reconsider** the way their values and ideas **do** and **do not
align** with the processes and value orientations experienced in the
world around them]{.underline}. Additionally, [they can **train fellow
researchers** to **focus** on these issues to a **greater extent** than
they had been focused on in the past]{.underline}. [This
can]{.underline} also [entail cultivating communities which are
**dialogic** and **supportive of alternative visions** in
research]{.underline} and social life.

Admittedly, one does have to face a forceful tide to critically question
the normalised neoliberal agenda in education today. Educational
[theorists may get the sense they are the only ones not working to
forward capitalist and state political-economic interests]{.underline}
in education faculties dominated by the competitive binary of
quantitative and qualitative. Like many, I have had to go to pains at
times to explain my research as research to some colleagues. They may
not be aware of theoretical approaches to educational scholarship,
depending on where they were trained. Philosophers of education also may
grapple to explain the practical relevance of their research, for
example, to knowledge exchange or knowledge transfer capacities of
higher education institutions. [They may find their work
categorised]{.underline} in some institutions [as]{.underline} '**[blue
sky]{.underline}**' [or]{.underline} '**[basic research]{.underline}**',
[which]{.underline} often [gets funded in **more limited ways**
than]{.underline} '**[applied]{.underline}**' [scholarship]{.underline}.
These challenges can be unsettling, as [one discovers their work is
**not regarded as valuable** in a larger community due to contrasting
visions of value]{.underline}.

Students have a great potential in this context, in pushing the field
forward and understanding and critically examining new developments in
society and in education. Ideally, with mentoring professors and
supervisors, they can learn to understand the historical backdrop to
current trends, while adapting more traditional philosophical and other
techniques to identifying and examining serious challenges to
informational and material equity and justice today. However, it is not
always easy to work with students in this way. Many educational
theorists may find their work is also misunderstood or unappreciated by
their students, as 'not really research'.

Most of my doctoral students arrive to my university with an interest in
educational philosophy and theory. Yet inevitably, after a year or so of
socialisation into my institution, with other [students]{.underline},
and in classes on 'qualitative and qualitative research methods', they
come to discuss their research plans with me, and their newly discovered
need to gather data---and the more, the better. Their methodology
teacher (reportedly) said nothing to them about philosophical methods as
educational research. The other students are not aware of any education
students who ever received a doctorate, or had their proposal confirmed,
without gathering and analysing data, by which they mean something cold
and detached, yet connected to the values and interests of particular
social and political institutions. Their initial proposals adopt an
apologetic tone for not relying upon quantitative methods. They
apparently learned in their courses that quantitative research can have
statistical validity and reliability, while qualitative research lacks
them. They develop a deficit view of theory, as not reliable, as not
transparent, not valid, not replicable, not generalisable, significant,
and on and on. They develop a view of philosophy of education as
deficient and lacking in the context of the great power of big data.

These students are not pushovers. They often have provocative
observations about equity and social justice issues, and strong analysis
skills. When I am the only person they know who is not gathering 'cold,
hard' data---and the more, the better---they are not unwise to
critically question my advice, which seems contrary to what everyone
else says.

Over time, I have refined my approach to handling this concern. First, I
try to interact at an institutional level to increase awareness of
philosophical and theoretical methods of educational research among
colleagues and students. When tasked with reviewing, reforming, and
updating curriculum, I make small and large strides to see my methods
included. A small stride is adding phrases about 'analytic methods',
'documentary analysis', 'theoretical approaches', and the like to
student guidebooks and curriculum documents, which previously presented
a binary approach to educational research, as either qualitative or
quantitative.

A larger effort can be made by offering new courses or sessions on
philosophical approaches and related topics in educational research,
which emphasise how [philosophical tools can **enhance**
research]{.underline} within and beyond the field of educational theory.
[Most]{.underline} education doctoral **[theses]{.underline}** in my
institution [include some discussion of]{.underline} conceptual or
theoretical **[framing]{.underline}**, [and most students]{.underline}
have social justice or related interests in mind in conducting
educational research. At the same time, all students must engage in
processes of getting ethical clearance to do their research. All of
these characteristics of their research process [invoke
philosophies]{.underline}, [for **conducting** research]{.underline},
[and for understanding **knowledge claims** and **methods of
argumentation**]{.underline} and other aspects of what is categorised as
'good' research.

These observations undergird my work to introduce more philosophical
ways of thinking and knowing into my institution's practices for
training educational researchers. Particularly when it comes to research
ethics, the subject matter has been alienated from its original purposes
in mainstream neoliberal educational organisations, so that ethical
approval is more about protecting universities and researchers than
about developing ethical research approaches, aims, and projects. The
need to bring ethics back to educational research ethics in higher
education is thus one particular area where educational theorists can
play a role, highlighting the value of ethical reflection in the conduct
of research, beyond matters of participant consent, or lack thereof.

In relation, [there is a need for]{.underline} more classes for students
at all levels which are oriented toward [**critically evaluating** and
**understanding**]{.underline}, [rather than **conforming**
to]{.underline}, agendas of big players in [cybernetic
capitalism]{.underline}, such as the multinational companies shaping the
global knowledge infrastructure and state information capitalism. In
this context, [most]{.underline} classes on globalisation and education
tend to [paint a **neutral picture** of]{.underline} recent developments
in neoliberal education and [cybernetic capitalism]{.underline}, if not
an outright positive one. Typically, [educators are encouraged
to]{.underline} '**[stay neutral]{.underline}**' in teaching such
classes. Meanwhile, [the **orientation** of]{.underline} higher
[education toward]{.underline} neoliberalism and [supporting cybernetic
capitalism **undergirds** the rest of the curriculum]{.underline},
[**hidden** and **explicit**]{.underline}. In this context, [to give a
critical analysis of these trends can be seen as **provocative** and
**deviant**]{.underline}, while classes that celebrate neoliberalism and
big data in conformance with institutional priorities are expected.
Here, there is little hope that students can learn to value
philosophical approaches which are simply cast in neoliberal
organisations as leisurely and unproductive. Thus, [curricula should be
**reoriented** toward providing **critical** analyses and not just
**complementary** ones]{.underline} in examining the rise of
neoliberalism in higher education and state information capitalism. This
background should also be reflected upon by educational theorists who
hope to understand and act effectively within contemporary higher
education institutions, anticipating misunderstanding and
misrepresentation of their ideas, and the related possibility that they
will be considered as deviant for questioning that which has been
systematically not questioned in mainstream curriculum for many years.

[Another strategy for introducing students to theory]{.underline} in
light of the pressures faced [is to direct them toward **critiques
of**]{.underline} educational [**research framings** that **exclude** or
**dismiss** theoretical approaches]{.underline}. I share with students
that assessments of research indicate that [philosophical research is
certainly capable of]{.underline} '**[rigour]{.underline}**',
**[originality]{.underline}**, [and **significance**]{.underline}. This
is true within research assessment exercises, [although these
**frameworks** should not be regarded as having a **monopoly**
on]{.underline} conceptions of [importance]{.underline} and other
research values. In relation, they can learn more about how educational
research faces challenges as a field, because often in empirical
educational studies '"what works" doesn't work' (Smeyers & Depaepe,
2006). Beyond these observations, one can point further to the works of
many educational philosophers who have more fully and compellingly
defended the field in the era of datafication, who can be cited and
shared with students (for example, Davis, 1999; Smeyers & Burbules,
2011; Smeyers, De Ruyter, Waghid, & Strand, 2014).

And I appeal to students with an observation about educational research
more generally: [All]{.underline} educational [research wishes to deal
with a **problem** or **challenge**]{.underline}, and usually it is
social nature. Each of my [students come]{.underline} to the field of
education [with a sense of wanting to **make things
better**]{.underline}, or to understand processes related to education
to enhance things. Sadly, [I see this motivation being **stamped out**
of students]{.underline}, [due to **pressures to conform** in the
process of becoming academic researchers]{.underline}. [Intrinsic
motivation **dies** in the face of extrinsic motivation to]{.underline}
pass administrative hurdles, get ethical clearance, and [conduct
research using **model best practices**]{.underline}. As a result of the
intensified pressures to conform, many students feel alienated from
their own work and voice over time. They see their desire to understand
minority experiences translated into the modification of psychological
instruments to test for anomie, or to generalise about changes in
happiness or flourishing. Doing something unique or critically
reflective seem more costly and risky than conforming. Here, [neoliberal
agendas]{.underline} in higher education can be seen to [**work
actively** on students]{.underline}, [as they must]{.underline} perform
apologies for not collecting big data, and [**compromise** what matters
to them to conform]{.underline} to environments which handle ethics,
significance, and other issues [in **narrow**]{.underline}, often
**[problematic]{.underline}**, [ways]{.underline}.

Philosophy of [education has been described as a **dying** field in the
era of datafication]{.underline}. Anecdotes and worst case scenarios of
philosophers and theorists being replaced with big data scholars suggest
to some people that it may be unethical even to continue to train
philosophical students, when 'the jobs may not be there'. In such a
context, [it \[is\] **imperative** to **train new**]{.underline}
educational [**theorists** in ways that can provide for their
**flourishing**]{.underline} in this environment: not to hide from ideas
of our time by looking backwards longingly, but to engage in the real
world in critical, thoughtful ways (Roberts, 2009). This may also
include developing intellectual kinship, and supporting communities of
inquiry within and outside institutions where ideas are and can be
valued and appreciated.

One thing is certain in this context. It is no use for educational
researchers to put their heads in the sand. [Staying versed in and
thoughtful regarding **what constitutes good**]{.underline} educational
[**research** is important]{.underline} for theorists of education.
Philosophical [thinkers must not only be **defensive** about the value
of what they do]{.underline}, [but **active** in constructing discourses
about what is **valuable**]{.underline}, **[significant]{.underline}**,
**[rigorous]{.underline}**, **[impactful]{.underline}**, [and **relevant
scholarship**]{.underline}. Without members of faculty taking leadership
in this era, cultivating good work in fields which are theoretical or
'arty' is bound to face more and more hurdles. Among these hurdles are
decreasing capacities for funding, recruiting, and training of future
theorists and philosophers. Fortunately, in this context it is often
easier to influence students than colleagues. [Students]{.underline} are
not inherently anti-philosophical, although they [can become
anti-philosophy **over time**]{.underline}, [in circumstances which
**systematically devalue** work which is seen as **threatening**
to]{.underline} status quo and agendas of multinational corporations and
other arsenal of [cybernetic capitalism]{.underline}. [Educating
students that theory **really is research**]{.underline} may feel like
an uphill battle, but it [is]{.underline} one **[worth engaging
in]{.underline}** if one aspires [to see]{.underline} the field, not to
mention [the **world**]{.underline}, **[flourish]{.underline}** in the
future.

**Amoore, 22**---Professor of Human Geography in the Department of
Geography, Durham University (Louise, "Machine learning political
orders," Review of International Studies, February 15, 2022, dml)
\[language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Yet, what I propose here is that machine learning political orders
reverse Deleuze's dictum so that [the political problem is
**constituted** by the posited solution]{.underline}; or, the solution
gets the problem it deserves. [The]{.underline} retroactive
[logic]{.underline} of deep learning commonly [**begins** with the
identification of the **target output**]{.underline} from the model,
actively using the output signals that diverge or converge on the target
as an experimental space of modulation and adjustment. Though there are
multiple possible functions or 'solutions that will match the data', a
machine learning algorithm will use 'two sources of information to
select the best function: one is the dataset, and the other (the
inductive bias) is the assumptions that bias the algorithm to prefer
some functions over others'. 40 In order [to change the output
signal]{.underline}, [the **weights**]{.underline} within the hidden
layers of the neural network [**adjust** and **modify** the
signal]{.underline} that feeds forward to the next layer. Why does this
computational process matter for how the political problem and the
solution interact? The retroactive move from target solution to the
weights in the model means that [the parameters and dimensions of an
**intractably difficult** political question]{.underline} -- democracy,
pandemic response, border security, stability in the economy -- [become
configured as **infinitely adjustable** in relation to the
solution]{.underline}. Where the concept of problematisation suggests a
multiplicity of actions that could take place under the broad unifying
conditions of the formulation of the problem -- and, indeed a space for
normative deliberation of possible actions -- [this]{.underline}
retroactive [paradigm **forecloses** the multiplicity of plural
solutions to a **single target**]{.underline}, [and **reduces** the
framing of the political problem to the **weighting of
inputs**]{.underline}. Every adjustment or modification of the
parameters in the deep learning model is simultaneously an arrangement
of the political problem.

[To begin at the]{.underline} '**[end]{.underline}**', [with a **target
output**]{.underline} of the model, [is]{.underline} thus [to
**transform radically** what a political claim can be]{.underline} in
the world. For example, machine learning algorithms are increasingly
being deployed in immigration and borders decisions. The introduction of
machine learning in the sorting and classification of visa applications
does not merely automate some aspects of a previously human centred
bureaucratic process. More than this, the building of a model of the
flows of immigration claims actively constitutes what a border can be
and how it is understood as a political question. Moreover, [the space
to **challenge** the political formulation]{.underline}, such as for
example to question the racialised criteria that are applied to the
judgement on a person, [is]{.underline} also **[closed
out]{.underline}** by the machine learning process. In contrast to the
rules-based models that I described as engineering racialised
assumptions into association rules (for example, in Rakesh Agrawal's
data mining models), machine learning learns and generates new racial
formations from the data examples. With machine learning forms of
classification, there are no criteria as such; there are only inputs,
outputs, features, and functions. The model will also adjust with the
volatilities and geopolitical disruptions of migration, shifting its
thresholds so that the derived outputs are decoupled from the input data
of a visa application.

[There are **profound political consequences** of this]{.underline} more
generative and disruptive [approach]{.underline} to data inputs. In
2020, for example, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants
(JCWI) challenged the UK Home Office's use of a 'streaming algorithm' to
allocate visa applications to high, medium, and low levels of risk. The
JCWI identified the nationality data that were among the inputs to the
algorithm that scored some applicants as 'high risk', effectively
automating the decision to refuse the visa. JCWI and Foxglove Legal
successfully argued that the nationality data are proxies for race and,
therefore, in breach of the provisions of the Equality Act 2010.41 If
the algorithm had been a solely rules-based 'if ... and ... then ...
else' sequence, then the juridical removal of racist input data would
arguably substantially change the outputs of the system. However, with
machine learning it would be a mistake to conclude that the removal of a
racist input will excise the racialised propositions of the model. The
streaming of visa applications into risk-rated clusters, as exhibited in
the JCWI case brought by Foxglove, is an example of a solution defining
and configuring the political problem, so that immigration targets are
the starting point. When the input data are not variables (in the
functionalist sense) but features, the UK Home Office can agree to
remove a racist input (as they have done) while continuing to weight
other features in ways that revitalise racist inferences that were not
strictly present in the input data. For example, the weighting and
parameters applied to travel, to familial relationships, or to periods
of time spent outside the UK can serve to constitute a suspicious
population and to generate a red-flagged output. When the model is
learning about salient features and clusters from the dataset, its
racialised assumptions will exceed the categories of the input data and
extend to the groupings and communities created by the machine learning
process. It is not only the use of data from which race can be inferred,
but more significantly that the immigration algorithm forecloses the
potential of a person's future on the basis of a racism that pervades
the model all the way down.42 In short, [the question of what kinds of
**political actions**]{.underline}, [which **political
claims**]{.underline}, [or which **policy agendas** can be designed and
made]{.underline}, [is **condensed down** to the foreclosure of a target
output solution]{.underline}.

When the design of a machine learning model becomes a valued political
object in itself, the derivative outputs of the model are exchangeable
and tradeable beyond any specific defined political problem or 'domain'.
43 In common with the models built by Cambridge Analytica,
[**everything** becomes a function of deep learning to the point that
there are **no bad outputs**]{.underline} -- [even where this may be
**illness**]{.underline}, **[racism]{.underline}**,
**[death]{.underline}**, **[destitution]{.underline}**, **[social
hardship]{.underline}**, **[child poverty]{.underline}** -- [there are
only **target outputs** and the **adjustable parameters** of a
problem]{.underline}. Amid the loss of more than 170,000 lives to
COVID-19, the UK launched its national data strategy in 2020, describing
the 'high watermark of data use set during the pandemic' where
businesses, government, and organisations had been 'freed up' to
'innovate and experiment'. 44

A period marked by lack of effective emergency planning and horrifying
loss of life is thus articulated as a 'high watermark of data use'. In
his testimony before the UK House of Commons Science and Technology
Select Committee, former advisor to the prime minister, Dominic
Cummings, explained that conventional civil contingencies 'did not have
the data architecture', and that 'companies \[DeepMind\] had stuff we
could use off the shelf, hack it together for the NHS.' 45 Behind the
rhetoric of his testimony, Cummings's account does express the deep
faith placed in deep learning models to address the data gaps in
bureaucratic structures. On the day that he appeared before MPs,
Cummings released a photograph of a whiteboard used to map early
pandemic planning. Among the scrawled notes, a question is posed: 'who
do we not save?'. Viewed from the perspective of the building of machine
learning models for the pandemic -- or the 'hacking together' by private
tech companies -- the question of who will not be saved is but a mere
parameter in a model, to be adjusted in relation to NHS capacity. In the
event, this parameter was also a deeply racialised metric -- with people
of black and South Asian ethnic background four times more likely to die
from COVID-19 in the UK.46 In common with the racialised logics of the
immigration algorithm, the pandemic models did not need to begin with
race as a category or input to nonetheless generate a deeply racialised
model of algorithmic violence. [The]{.underline} machine learning
[model]{.underline} itself [has **extraordinary resilience** in the face
of **complete moral** and **political failures** because a **weight can
always be adjusted**]{.underline}, [a **threshold modified**, a
**parameter tweaked**]{.underline}. The question of 'who do we not
save?' is translated into the parameter of a model whose target outputs
are the starting point. [In]{.underline} a situation where there is a
[**total** and **abject failure** of policy and good
governance]{.underline}, the [innovation]{.underline} in data science
and AI [is **nonetheless fostered** by the racialised violence and
social turbulence that is generated]{.underline}. Whether this is
incorrect or unjust decisions made in an algorithmic benefits system,
poor judgements on policing deployment, or the catastrophic pursuit of a
modelled 'herd immunity', [machine learning political orders **learn
something** from the data generated by the volatility]{.underline}.

A similar sense of the productivity of fractured governance is present
in the UNHCR's statements that 'even in highly volatile and chaotic
environments', digital systems will 'radically expand the responses that
can be crafted for challenges in health care, education, migration, and
security'. 47 The organisation envisages machine learning technologies
within a process of 'competitive disruption' to what it calls 'obsolete'
institutional structures 'with legacies dating back to World War II'.
The flexibility and agility of a deep learning model -- deployed, for
example, in UNHCR's 'Project Jetson' predictive models of refugee
movements -- becomes a condition of possibility for the imagination of
adaptive digital humanitarian and pandemic response, so that social and
political relations are reconfigured as the parameters of a model.48

In each of the examples I describe above, functionally arranged
structures of postwar social and international orders are reimagined
along the dimensions of a machine learning universal function. That is
to say, a function that is immanently mappable from a target output to
the weightings of the layers of the problem. [To propose that a
policy]{.underline} or an institution [must deliver on a
function]{.underline} thus also [**shifts** its ground]{.underline} --
[for something to]{.underline} '**[function]{.underline}**' [it **no
longer needs to work** as such]{.underline}.49 As Debbie Lisle has
argued, the cultures of science and engineering mobilise a politics
within which '**[failure]{.underline}**' [itself is rendered
an]{.underline} '**[instructive experience]{.underline}**'. 50 Within a
machine learning logic, the instructive experience of failure permits
the model to learn those unknown things that are beyond the distribution
of data in a training dataset. Though machine learning orders cannot be
said to fail as such -- or at least the output of the model is never a
failure but only a signal -- the retroactive generation of political
problem from output solution means that the very idea that a neural net
can approximate any function becomes a powerful political idea. In
short, though these ideas of failure are ontologically distinct, they
become epistemically aligned; [there is **slippage** between failure as
learning]{.underline}, [and the idea that there can be **no ethical
failure**]{.underline}, [nor **catastrophic policy
failure**]{.underline}.

[At stake]{.underline} in retroactive design, then, [is not merely
that]{.underline} deep learning [algorithms are deployed to **govern
society**]{.underline}, [but rather that society comes to **understand
itself** and its **problems** through the lens of the **deep learning
model**]{.underline}. The [relations among people]{.underline},
[objects]{.underline}, [and space become rendered as features from which
something useful **can always be extracted**]{.underline}, from which a
function can always be found. However, [the plurality and multiplicity
of those relations]{.underline}, [and the potentiality for new or
alternative political projects to emerge]{.underline}, [is **radically
foreclosed**]{.underline} around the retroactive mapping from target
output to the weighting of parameters in a model. It is to the
usefulness of exposure to contingency that I now turn, with a discussion
of how technological trials became perennial and indefinite.

Trial by design: How the test became an indefinite trial

The concept of alpha and beta testing has its origins in IBM's 1950s
software development, when the 'A' test signalled the in-house testing
to improve the engineering and the 'B' test referred to the verification
through user engagement and development. [In]{.underline} his account of
Cold War America and the culture and politics of computers, Paul Edwards
describes [the emergence of cybernetic culture and its penetration of
**state** and **military thinking**]{.underline}. In the context of
Edwards's 'closed world' integration of a 'seamless web' of human and
machine systems, the engineer deploys [the **testing**
regime]{.underline} in a form that mirrors the hierarchical logics of
computers.51 As an engineering practice of the twentieth century, the
test [formed an **intrinsic part** of the rules-based and cybernetic
approaches to government]{.underline} and computer science. As Edwards
depicts the Cold War collaborations of IBM, RAND, and the aircraft
corporations, [the **process of political planning itself** became
an]{.underline} '**[if]{.underline}** ... **[then]{.underline}**'
[proposition]{.underline}, 'constructing a list of tests to perform',
[identifying failings as **information problems**]{.underline}, [and
creating **feedback loops**]{.underline} from test to engineer.52 In
this sense, the Cold War alliances between computer science,
mathematics, and the military state embodied a specific understanding of
testing as practice, and of errors as problems of fallible human
perception that could be corrected with machine systems.53

This conception of testing and the sequential procedures of the 'list of
tests to perform' is aligned with the rules-based
[computation]{.underline} and rules-based social and international
political orders I have described. It [is a conception of]{.underline}
the test that is deeply probabilistic and conceives as [testing as a
process concerned with the **calculation of
probabilities**]{.underline}. As Orit Halpern describes the
cyberneticians' practices, 'they focused on the ability to calculate the
probability that one set of interactions (the missile hitting the plane)
will occur, over other sets less likely but possible'. '[This is a
worldview composed of]{.underline} functionally similar entities --
black boxes', she writes, composed only of 'their [algorithmic actions
in **constant conversation** with each other producing a range of
probabilistic scenarios]{.underline}'. 54

Against this historical backdrop of probabilistic alpha and beta testing
within functionally similar entities, the rise of deep learning
algorithms is most profoundly possibilistic in its orientation to the
future.55 As a mode of political ordering, machine learning circumvents
modern notions of testing in science and engineering by turning to the
trial and trialling as experimental technology. The trial is a more
possibilistic approach precisely because it refutes the functionally
similar entities and probabilities Halpern denotes in cybernetics, and
it embraces instead the generation of multiple possible functions in
order to defer a decision on what is politically useful. Understood in
this way, the rise of trialling in contemporary machine learning has
more in common with the conduct of stress testing to anticipate
uncertainty in finance than it does with alpha and beta testing in
software engineering.56 The machine learning model dwells indefinitely
in its trial phase because it is designed and redesigned through its
exposure to people, objects, places, and scenes, perennially modifying
itself in response to what it has learned through its encounters. In
this way, the 'demo' as technological demonstration, has a close
relationship with the 'demos' as the people, the population and
democracy.57 'Our forms of technological testing and demoing', writes
Halpern, 'envision a world where artificial intelligences and computers
can replace the democracy that is now imagined to be obsolescent'. 58
[As deep learning models penetrate public space]{.underline}, for
instance in live facial recognition biometric systems in urban spaces,
at borders, and in military spaces, [**every trial** of a deep learning
model is also an **active reconfiguration** of that space as the model
adapts in response to the contingencies it yields]{.underline}.59

For example, in the world's first legal challenge to police use of
automated facial recognition algorithms (AFR), the appellant, Bridges,
argued that South Wales Police unlawfully extracted his biometric data
during two trials of the technology.60 Bridges had been subject to AFR
during a protest outside an arms fair in Cardiff in 2018, and during a
Christmas shopping trip in 2017, with each trial of the system storing
his biometric data, cross-matching with a watchlist, generating match
scores, and modifying the sensitivity of the model. The court of appeal
found in Bridges favour in 2020, following testimony from an expert
computer scientist whose account vividly illustrates how the trial
indelibly marks and recalibrates a gendered and racialised system. 'AFR
systems will have a higher error rate for women and people from black
and ethnic minority groups', he testified, and 'where an end user is
adjusting threshold values it may make the AFR system particularly
sensitive for some individuals. People from that ethnic group will be
wrongly matched more often.' Thus, the trial of AFR -- ongoing for a
seemingly indefinite period from 2017 -- will continue to generate
racialised outputs and clusters of suspicion, even where individual
biometric datasets are deleted. As Rocco Bellanova and Marieke de Goede
describe architectures of data analysis, 'the infrastructure aims at
defining the "right population" to be algorithmically governed.' 61 The
very communities who are already disproportionately targeted by the
state will experience an intensification of scrutiny and control. In
this way, the capacity of a person to be present, or to gather with
others, in public space is iteratively and intimately related to the
exposures of a machine learning model that is indefinitely trialled
across multiple spaces. Unlike the feedback loops of Edwards's Cold War
military-computer science collaborations, the error rate of the
biometrics are contingent on the shifting infrastructural thresholds and
parameters of the algorithm. Whereas the cybernetic mode of testing was
concerned with the engineering of human and machinic component parts,
the machine learning mode of indefinite trials makes the limit and the
threshold the object of the trial, so that setting sensitivities, moving
borders and boundaries reconfigures both algorithm and action.

In this way, the orientation of the indefinite trial is closer to an
experimental and open-ended process of design than it is to engineering.
The very etymology of design is from the Latin designare, to designate,
to mark out, and related to disegnare, to contrive or intend. It is
precisely this process of designating and marking out that I see at work
in the indefinite trials of deep learning technologies in cities, at
borders, in public space. Bruno Latour outlines a philosophy of design
in which 'design has been extended from the details of daily objects to
cities, landscapes, nations, cultures, bodies, genes.' 62 For Latour,
the practice of design is counterposed to historical notions of building
or engineering, so that 'things are no longer "made" or "fabricated",
but rather designed.' 'This was the old way', he writes, 'to build, to
construct, to destroy, to radically overhaul' through engineering.63 By
contrast, to design something, for Latour, is never to found something
radically new but always to seek perennial iterative modification, so
that 'it is never a process that begins from scratch: to design is
always to redesign.' It is for this reason -- the practices of design as
open-ended iterative modification, even as 'anti-revolutionary' -- that
I align contemporary machine learning models with design and not
strictly with engineering.64

Indeed, many contemporary deep learning practices such as 'transfer
learning' definitively reject 'handcrafting representations', in favour
of 'greedy exploration'. 65 Every action is a modification of the
residue that is already lodged within the layers of the model, it is
never a complete overhaul or disruption. As Latour suggests, 'to say
everything has to be designed and redesigned, it will never be
revolutionary'. 66 This foreclosure of something different, something
revolutionary, is a crucial problem in machine learning political
epistemes. As I have described, even where the practice of trialling a
model is found to be in breach of law, or where racist data inputs are
removed, still nothing revolutionary can emerge. For design can always
modify and adjust and move the threshold, each adjustment another
indelible mark, a marking out and a demarcation line. When Latour
concludes that 'designing is the antidote to founding, colonizing
establishing', I must disagree with him, for it is precisely colonising
in ways that incorporate ever-increasing layers, extend to ever more
domains of life, and dwell quietly in the violences of the modified
weight. What new or alternative politics can possibly emerge when every
potential pathway has already been narrowed to a mere parameter? It is
to the implications and potentials for alternative political futures
that I now turn in conclusion.

Design interruptions: Resisting machine learning worlds

In setting the themes that animate this Special Issue on disruption,
Nicole Grove posed the question 'what kind of worlds are in store for us
as algorithms disrupt forms of organisation and advocacy for more
equitable futures?'. 67 I have sought to map out how machine learning
actively incorporates the data from disrupted and fractured forms of
organisation, and why it is that advocacy for alternative political
futures becomes foreclosed in the logics of retroactivity and perennial
trialling. I have suggested that a machine learning political episteme
-- one that eschews rulesbased computational and political orders -- is
profiting from the undoing of postwar international and social
institutions, from the deep neural networks powering the Vote Leave
campaign to the so-called 'digital transformation' of the pandemic NHS.
While, of course, I am not nostalgic for cybernetic worlds of
rules-based computation and the liberal international order,
nevertheless it is the case that notions of democratic life, human
rights, and social ethics also grew amid such rules oriented orders.
Where machine learning political orders are precisely profiting from the
undoing of rights and collective public institutions, there are new
challenges for the politics of resistance.

What happens to the space for resistance amid the power of the machine
learning algorithm? What are the possibilities for reopening the futures
that are condensed and foreclosed in the output of a deep neural
network? Where machine learning algorithms are increasingly learning
from the features of social scenes and the gathering of people in public
space, is collective politics reduced to a being together that is merely
the clustering of attributes? As Judith Butler has put the question,
'what does it mean to act together when the conditions for acting
together are devastated or falling away?'. 68 Such questions are more
urgent and acute because the threats to the rights to protest and
freedoms to assemble are intensified by a machine learning order that
absorbs the attributes of collective action. In her treatise on
political assembly, Butler imagines that the 'gathering signifies in
excess of what is said' and that 'popular assemblies form unexpectedly
and dissolve', exercising a 'plural and performative right to appear'.
69 Yet, this plural and performative excess of the gathering of
vulnerable bodies in public space is precisely under threat from the
retroactive and trialling logics of the machine learning polity.

When the machine learning algorithm becomes the mise-en-scène of the
public square, the means of arranging the scene and extracting the
features, what political claim can be heard that is not already
extracted and scored, and who can make it? [The **task for
resistance**]{.underline}, I suggest, [is to **interrupt the ordering**
of the political scene in order to ask how it **might be
otherwise**]{.underline}. My emphasis on interruption consciously
rejects the vocabularies of disruption that animate the force of
disruptive technologies and 'push on the fracture until it breaks' tech
industry cultures. [To interrupt the scene is to **resist its very
condition of appearance**]{.underline}, [to **locate the breaches** in
algorithmic arrangements and to show how they **could be
otherwise**]{.underline}. As Walter Benjamin notes of Bertolt Brecht's
device of 'interruption' in epic theatre, 'the truly important thing is
to discover the conditions of life', where this discovery 'takes place
through the interruption of happenings'. 70 [To interrupt the scene of a
machine learning political order would be to **confront the plural
branching pathways** that could have yielded a different output and to
**amplify** those branches as political decisions]{.underline}. [In
**every** arrangement of a machine learning model there are the
**traces** of the **rejected alternative**]{.underline}. Brecht's device
of [interruption presents]{.underline} the observer with [the traces of
what **could have been present**]{.underline}, with the actor performing
'[in such a way that the alternative emerges **as clearly as
possible**]{.underline}', [allowing]{.underline} '[**other
possibilities** to be inferred]{.underline}' [even while]{.underline}
she \[[they]{.underline}\] '[represent]{.underline}s [**one** out of the
possible variants]{.underline}'. 71 In this way, the
[interruption]{.underline} of the scene [**works against the grain** of
the algorithm's reduction to **one visible output**]{.underline},
showing the contingency and multiplicity of the one out of many possible
variants. [Here lies a **significant form** of resistance]{.underline};
[to **amplify** the branching points as moments where things **could
have been otherwise**]{.underline}, [where other possibilities **could
be inferred**]{.underline}; [and to **refuse the reduction** of
political difficulty to **one** that is the **output**]{.underline}.

[To resist being governed by a machine learning political order will
necessitate naming the harms]{.underline} -- [**beyond** the conventions
of]{.underline} privacy, data protection, and **[existing bodies of
rights]{.underline}** -- [of the foreclosure of alternative political
futures]{.underline}. Though the machine learning political orders I
have described close off political contestation and unheard claims,
under the figure of the machine learning model there remains a teeming
politics. [When the solution precedes the political
problem]{.underline}, [the adjustment of parameters is also a **real**
and **violent modification** of people's lives]{.underline} -- as
migrants, as benefit claimants, as people gathering in the city square.
It is for this reason that [the]{.underline} deep learning [practice of
modifying]{.underline} '**[weights]{.underline}**' [in the model **must
be rendered heavier** and **more burdensome** than the **lightness** of
an adjustment implies]{.underline}. [The weight in a machine learning
model is **not merely**]{.underline} a **[technical]{.underline}**
weight on a connection in the neural net. [It is the full burden and
heaviness of a **rejected visa application**]{.underline}, [a **past
facial biometric** captured at a protest]{.underline}, [a **refused
welfare claim**]{.underline}, [the extracted features of the
**refugee**]{.underline}. In her compelling account of how colonial
formations endure, Ann Laura Stoler foregrounds the 'enduring fissure'
and the 'durable mark' of imperial duress.72 Stoler's affecting thought
about 'duress' foregrounds the 'hardened, tenacious qualities of
colonial effects' and 'endurance' in the 'capacity to "hold out" and
"last", to endure as a countermand to "duress" and its damaging
qualities'. 73 The weight of the machine learning algorithm could be
freighted with the heaviness and endurance of Stoler's imperial duress.
[**Each adjustment** and **modification** of the model a **squeezing**
and a **tightening** of the conditions of liveability]{.underline} of a
political space, a community. Every indefinite trial a trial in the
fullest sense of something that is borne by vulnerable bodies.

### Perm Core---2NC\*\*\*

#### \*\*\*Note while prepping: While I wrote some things out, this is not intended as a catch-all perm block. You could read this block largely as-is against "perm do both," but if there's more nuance to the perm or multiple different perms, consider adding in some theory arguments about severance or intrinsicness (which I intentionally did not include in this block, as they are perm-dependent), or splitting up some of the analytics/cards/etc among the different perms. Don't just group them, read this frontline, and move on!

#### Mutually exclusive: the alt is an [ethos]{.underline} that [refuses]{.underline} liberal legal solutions like the aff. A politics of corporeal care is [intrinsically opposed]{.underline} to attempts to make life into data, so if we win a link then the perm [can't overcome it]{.underline}---that's Dyer-Witheford.

#### Judge competition based on [holistic epistemological commitments]{.underline}, not [unique opportunity costs]{.underline}. The alt and the aff are both [more]{.underline} than the sum of their parts or individual arguments; the logic of their perm is premised on [rational cost-benefit analysis]{.underline} that can [only determine]{.underline} that the alt is not an opportunity cost by [quantifying]{.underline} it into discrete components and [rearranging]{.underline} them in combination with the aff, which [is the link]{.underline}.

#### If we win [any part]{.underline} of our framework, then the perm fails---inclusion of the aff brings in outdated liberal legal epistemologies that [irrevocably misdirect]{.underline} their research agenda. Only the alt [alone]{.underline} can overcome the cybernetic episteme.

**Jiménez, 22**---Melbourne Law School, The University of Melbourne
(Aitor, "Law, Code and Exploitation: How Corporations Regulate the
Working Conditions of the Digital Proletariat," Critical Sociology,
2022, Vol. 48(2) 361--373, dml)

[The **fundamental problem**]{.underline} with the liberal mentality [is
that even the **most progressive interpretation** of current or future
liberal legal developments **won't go to the bone** of the exploitative
nature of digital capitalism]{.underline}. That is, to the antagonistic
relation between workers and capital. In short, [the liberal comprehends
work and relations of production within the **liberal
framework**]{.underline}, which has as central faiths the belief in: (1)
the rule of law, and (2) the causal interrelation between law and
relations of production. [Under this liberal framework]{.underline}, [a
**good**]{.underline} labour [**law** will frame the way work is
organised]{.underline}. Yet, [this has been **proved** to be
**wrong**]{.underline}. [Digital capitalism runs **faster** than **every
possible law** or **court decision**]{.underline}. Besides -- and above
everything -- labour exploitation is not a crime (Snider, 2018) since it
is the pillar of the capitalistic regime.

Second, [the relation of law and capital is **not causal**]{.underline}.
[Law is **not neutral** but rather determined by the **social
formation** producing it]{.underline}. [The **legal epicentre** of the
relations of production in contemporary capitalism is **not** a net of
**private contractual agreements**]{.underline}, between workers and
capitalists. [Even changing the **nature**]{.underline}, [the
**form**]{.underline}, [even the **contents** of the
contracts]{.underline} (e.g. extending employees benefits to every
worker, which would be a great improvement), [the **overall course** of
events will not change]{.underline}. This is demonstrated by the way
digital capitalists won in 2020 an important political battle in the US.
In 2019, California passed the Assembly Bill 5 (2019); it was a major
victory for those advocating for the implementation of the ABC test as a
way of combating worker's mislabelling as contractors. It took effect in
January 2020, just to be overruled 10 months later by the
corporate-backed Proposition 22, which legalised the worker-unfriendly
previous status quo (Siddiqui and Tiku, 2020).

The ABC test is one of the declinations of the liberal fallacy that
existing law can be adapted or extended (or reinterpreted) to address
the problems of the digital proletariat. In order to determine the legal
status of the worker as employee or contractor, the test looks at
something as ethereal as 'the employer\'s control or direction in
performing the work'. [Digital capitalists have been able to
**game**]{.underline} labour [legislation]{.underline}, both using East
Coast Code and West Coast Code, 'the code that code writers "enact"'
(software) (Lessig, 2006: 72). [Creativity **does not remove** the
exploiter]{.underline}. A judge in Valencia (Spain) put on paper what is
obvious to workers, clients, and the general public: 'the true means of
production in this activity are not the bicycle and the cell phone that
the delivery person uses, but the digital platform for matching supply
and demand owned by the company, outside of which the provision of the
service is not feasible' (Pitarch and Marco, 2019).

The main issue with [the legal liberal mind-set is]{.underline} that,
deep, rich and thorough as it is, it is [**limited** by the burdens of
the **capitalist legal form**]{.underline}. And [this **impedes**
liberal lawmakers and scholars in their ability to realise that the
**central aspect** of the relations of production is the **production
process itself**]{.underline}. The working class' [**material
conditions** won't change until **power relations**]{.underline} in
contemporary spaces of production [change]{.underline} as well. [The
**only way** to deal with the exploitative nature of labour is by
**thinking from a non-capitalist epistemology**]{.underline}.

#### Subsumption DA: The perm [subsumes]{.underline} the alt's radical potential. Means at [best]{.underline} the perm can't solve and at [worst]{.underline} it's a [new unique link]{.underline} because they [actively re-engineer debate]{.underline} for data extraction.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 127-130, dml)

However, [inside the University]{.underline}, [technology is used to
**re-engineer** academic work]{.underline}, in terms of teaching,
research, scholarship and administration, [through]{.underline}
processes that Marx (2004) referred to as formal and real
**[subsumption]{.underline}**. [These processes enable capital to **take
control** of **previously unproductive sectors**]{.underline} of the
economy, [to focus upon **value-production**]{.underline}. This occurs
in two ways: first, as sectors or organizations are re-purposed so that
the conditions of work generate value, in absolute terms---for instance,
by lengthening the working day; and second, as sectors or organizations
are transformed through organizational development or technological
deployment, in order to generate value in relative terms. As sectors
become more competitive and the terrain for accruing surplus value
becomes more difficult, mechanisms like increasing the hours of work
cannot generate enough value. As a result, capitalist [businesses look
for increases in productivity]{.underline}, in order to drive surplus.
One issue here is that capitalists are competing for relative amounts of
the total social capital realized as profit. If the global economy
slows, surpluses stagnate and profitability reduces, the competition
becomes more intense. This is one potential mode for analysing the MOOC
agenda and the focus of universities in working in joint ventures with
educational technology firms, hedge funds, publishers and so on (see
Shanley, Swierstra & Wyatt, Chapter 11, in this volume).

Thus, the idea that [academic work]{.underline} might be infused with
humanism [is **framed** by the **recalibration** of
universities]{.underline} in the sector as a whole,
[through]{.underline} competition that includes: [the generation of
knowledge as a **commodity for exchange**]{.underline}; research outputs
as private property; capturing and retaining student numbers, grounded
in new forms of student finance; and the deployment of new technologies
to drive teaching and administration efficiencies. Technology-driven
recalibration enables labour-time to be reduced in principle. In
practice, [it becomes the **most unfailing means** for]{.underline}
turning the whole lifetime of a worker and \[her\] family into
labour-time'; enforces the metronomic control of the 'motion of the
whole factory'; separates 'the intellectual faculties of the production
process from manual labour'; and, is 'continually
**[transforming]{.underline}** not only the technical basis of
production but also the functions of [the **worker** and]{.underline}
the social combinations of [the **labour process**]{.underline}'. (Marx
2004: 531--532, 546, 548, 617)

Crucially, even for academics notionally working in a privileged
profession, under capitalist social relations, [technology **totalizes**
proletarianization as a form of **ongoing immiseration**]{.underline}.
[This forces the individual academic onto a **treadmill** of
**constantly needing to upgrade**]{.underline} their human capital, in
order [to generate **commodity skills** that can be **valorized** inside
competing]{.underline} departments or [institutions]{.underline}
(Newfield 2010). Whether they can generate these skills or not, they are
partially developed individuals, precisely because [they become
**subordinated** to the production of]{.underline} '**[objective
wealth]{.underline}**, in the form of capital, an alien power that
dominates and exploits' (Marx 2004: 716). Processes of
proletarianization include the routinized nature of teaching and
research, the imposition of technology-mediated, menial tasks and the
reduction of intellectual work to standardized processes. [This creates
a **field of exploitation**]{.underline}, [inside which the academic is
**continually alienated**]{.underline} from their labour-power and the
conditions under which they work (Hall 2018). On an everyday basis, an
expanding global circuit of alienation reproduces exploitation, in order
to generate relative surplus value.

Thus, [academic labour is **subsumed**]{.underline} under a global
production machine, and is further conditioned [by
**policy-discourses**]{.underline}. [This machinery **disassembles**
existing flows of labour]{.underline}, finance and technology, [and
**reassembles** them for profit]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari 1983).
In this way, capital enforces humanmachine interaction as a means to
parasitize labour (Wendling 2009: 100). The conditioning of this
machinery is important for the widening circuit of alienation that
reproduces exploitation. As technologies are reconceptualized as
platforms, this circuit is widened out beyond institutions and sectors.
[Platforms enable users or audiences to be **exploited** in the
production of services that can be **commodified**]{.underline}, [such
as the **production of educational content**]{.underline} or the grading
of assessments, or from which rents can be taken in the consumption of
those services. In these modes of production, there is a clear division
of labour and hierarchy of control, rooted in precarious employment and
the need to have ready access to commodities. Moreover, the platform
enables controlled access to those services through mediations of
commodity-exchange and private property.

These approaches are legitimized at the level of society, through the
normalization of platforms that drive cost-efficiencies in transport,
hospitality and accommodation. Thus, determinist narratives of
technological progress elide with liberal ideas of equality of
opportunity and freedom of access, underpinned by free markets and
performance data (Feenberg 1999). [**Any political refusal** of
these]{.underline} economic [narratives]{.underline} (for instance, in
support of academic freedom) [tend to be met by cries to
**reform**]{.underline} the sector, [based on discourses of
**efficiency** and **productivity**]{.underline}. Moreover, [these
narratives **amplify intersectional** and **intergenerational
injustices** because they **reinforce hegemonic norms** of
**excellence**]{.underline}, entrepreneurialism [and **impact** that are
**white**]{.underline}, **[male]{.underline}**, [**ableist** and
**heterosexual**]{.underline}, [and which enable specific aggregations
of human capital]{.underline} (Boyd 2017).

[Technology **optimizes** this across the terrain of academic labour
because it structures governable spaces]{.underline}---for instance,
[through]{.underline} performance [data that **enables**]{.underline}
the **[comparison]{.underline}** of individuals, subjects and
institutions [against **imposed norms** that are
disciplinary]{.underline}. Technologies and [techniques of governance
**optimize**]{.underline} performance management and encourage certain
[behaviours]{.underline}, [and this is given **regulatory power** over
individual agency through institutional governance]{.underline}.
Optimization is further amplified through new technological
compositions, rooted in the idea of the platform, operating as a
controlling, distribution infrastructure that mediates between
contracting parties. This has been reified as freeing labour from
capitalists, so that they can commission work directly (Pasquale 2016).
There is a value-based ecosystem that surrounds the platform, emerging
from the commissioning of work and the extraction of data about that
work, in terms of the fluidity of activities. Drawing individuals to the
platform, in order to monopolize data about suppliers and consumers is
pivotal, in particular in generating predictive data about future
behaviours.

This is important in [the context of the University]{.underline},
because the generation of a controlled ecosystem for collecting rent
based on the distribution of commodities and for the concomitant
accumulation of data about those commodities, enables innovation in
knowledge production, circulation and accumulation. In particular,
generating analytics or large datasets **[enables]{.underline}**
dominant protocols and algorithms to affect learning and teaching,
knowledge production and transfer, research impact and so on through
**[cybernetic control]{.underline}** (Lazzarato 2014). This offers the
opportunity for HE providers to impose flexploitation [through the
creation of]{.underline} micro-activities or [**micro-commodities** in
relation to the production of]{.underline} curriculum content,
**[research outputs]{.underline}**, assessments and so on (Morgan & Wood
2017). [This **transforms** academic work because **new relations** of
production are realized in precarious]{.underline}, flexible and
part-time [contracts that enforce entrepreneurial work in multiple
contexts upon individual academics]{.underline}.

[A **crucial**]{.underline}, [**spill-over** issue is that]{.underline}
platforms tend to have an embedded epistemic privilege that is
reproduced as data based on a specific political economic model, inside
which specific users behaving in particular ways constantly provide
optimizing performance data (Huws 2014; Srnicek 2017; see Barry, Chapter
5, in this volume). In this process of optimization, individuals have to
enrich their knowledge, skills and capacities, and also their attitude
and commitment to enrichment and their job, which becomes an alienating
labour of love (Hall 2018). Thus, [not only is work **proletarianized**
inside the University]{.underline}, [but proletarianization **infects
the academic's soul**]{.underline}. Thus, as Hall (2016) points out, in
HE [this tends towards the **Uberification** of the
University]{.underline}, [because knowledge becomes a **commodity** that
is **privatized** rather than being a **social good**]{.underline}.

Abstract

Among many influences that the pandemic has and will have on society and
the World System as a whole, one of the most important is [the
acceleration of the start of a **new technological wave** and a **new
technological paradigm**]{.underline} in the near future. This impact
[is **determined** by the **growing need** for the development
of]{.underline} a number of areas in **[medicine]{.underline}**,
**[bio]{.underline}**- [and]{.underline}
**[nanotech]{.underline}**nology, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and **others**]{.underline}, which we
denote as "**[MANBRIC convergence]{.underline}**". It is shown that the
experience of dealing with the [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic has
confirmed that the [**final phase** of the Cybernetic Revolution will
begin in the **2030s** at the intersection of a number of]{.underline}
medical, bio, digital and several other [technologies]{.underline}, with
medical needs as an integrating link. Among [the multitude of
self-regulating systems in the economy and life]{.underline}
([which]{.underline}, in our opinion, [will **flourish** during the
Cybernetic Revolution]{.underline}) socio-technical self-regulating
systems (SSSs) will play a special role. Thus, COVID-19 [becomes a
**powerful impetus** not only in terms of accelerating technological
development and approaching the final phase of the Cybernetic
Revolution]{.underline}, [but also in **changing
sociopolitical**]{.underline} ([and
**socio-administrative**]{.underline}) [**relations** in the forthcoming
decades]{.underline}.

1\. Introduction

1.1. Multidimensional impact of COVID-19

By now, there have been quite a number of articles about the coronavirus
(COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) and its effect on society (e.g., Atkeson
2020; Baker et al., 2020; L. Grinin 2020; Irshad 2020; Jasiński and
Bąkowska 2020; see also further references below). In addition to
research on possible strategies for dealing with the pandemic (including
its consequences) and various medical aspects, many other issues are
being studied, from economic consequences to the impact on the climate
(Aslam et al., 2020; Belhadi et al., 2020; Brammer et al., 2020;
Chakraborty and Maity 2020; Forster et al., 2020; Yoo and Managi 2020;
see also below). So far, with the exception of the book by Klaus Schwab
and Thierry Malleret \"COVID-19: The Great Reset\" (Schwab and Malleret
2020), the study of this new phenomenon still seems mostly unsystematic.
However, one may argue that the COVID-19 pandemic can become an
important driver of even greater changes (e.g., Brammer et al., 2020;
Brem et al., 2020; Hofbauer and Komlosy 2020), whose nature and
consequences, however, are still mostly unclear. We believe that the
COVID-19 pandemic will significantly accelerate the processes that we
have already discussed in our other works (Grinin, L., Grinin, A., 2015;
2016; Grinin et al., 2017a; 2017b; 2020; Grinin, Korotayev 2015, Tausch
2016). It will also speed up some other processes that deserve close
attention.

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [has **significantly changed** the
public\'s focus]{.underline}; [these changes are likely to persist for a
long time]{.underline}. Ultimately, [this may lead to **significant
technological transformations**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, in
our opinion, [are]{.underline} rather [underestimated]{.underline}.

In the present article we would like to show that the COVID-19 pandemic
has become [a **powerful trigger** which will both **accelerate**
technological development in medicine and other areas]{.underline} --
[especially in]{.underline} the ones forming [the
MANBRIC-system]{.underline}1 -- [and]{.underline}, [at the same
time]{.underline}, [catalyze the **convergence** of these
areas]{.underline}. This [is]{.underline} greatly supported by [the
**sharply increased demand** for the development of a number of fields
of **medicine**]{.underline}, **[bio]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[nanotech]{.underline}**nology, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and **others**]{.underline}. In a series
of papers, including ones on the pages of this journal (Grinin et al.,
2017; 2020) we made some forecasts concerning [a **new technological
wave** making the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution]{.underline},
which is likely to start in the 2030s to 2040s. In the present article,
we refine our forecast, arguing with greater confidence that due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution [will
begin in the **2030s**]{.underline}, that is, **[in the next 10-15
years]{.underline}**. The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [has not only
**confirmed** our forecasts]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} also
[allowed us to **significantly refine** and **enrich**
them]{.underline}.

We also argue that among [numerous self-regulating systems]{.underline}
in production, economy and everyday life that will thrive during the
final phase, the socio-technical self-regulating systems (SSS) will play
a special role. [With the help of **AI**]{.underline}, they [will
regulate a **variety** of administrative and social
relations]{.underline}. During the pandemic, there appeared an urgent
need for regulation of public life, which served as an impetus for the
development of such systems. Meanwhile, [the employment of
socio-technical self-regulating systems will **almost inevitably** lead
to a **noticeable change** in social and]{.underline} even [political
relations]{.underline} in society, [shifting them towards
**e-government** and **e-state**]{.underline}. The present article also
devotes considerable attention to the analysis of the latter, while
addressing such an issue as the rapidly growing threat to privacy and
personal data.

Combining technological and social forecasts in a single study appears
all the more important, since a systematic research of the relationships
and interactions between the rapid development of various technologies,
especially AI technologies, medicine and biotechnology, on the one hand,
and social and political relations, on the other, unfortunately, remains
insufficient. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown some mechanisms of such
system connections, thus helping improve forecasts.

1.2. Research questions

In this article, we would like to focus on the problems of a possible
acceleration of the final phase of the Cybernetic Revolution in
connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The beginning of the Cybernetic
Revolution marks changes in technologies and [the coming of]{.underline}
a **[new]{.underline}** technological wave when
**[medicine]{.underline}**, [**bio** and
**nanotechnologies**]{.underline}, **[AI]{.underline}** [and **other
technologies**]{.underline} will play an important role. It also [means
an **increasing influence** of technology on social]{.underline},
[political and other relations]{.underline}. In particular, [the
unfolding Cybernetic Revolution will be associated with the **widespread
introduction** of self-regulating systems]{.underline} in production and
a wide variety of services, as well as [in everyday life]{.underline}.
Self-regulating systems are systems that can function with minimal human
involvement or without it (Grinin, L., Grinin, A., 2015; 2016; Grinin et
al., 2017a; 2017b; 2020; Grinin, Korotayev 2015, Tausch 2016). Among the
existing and future self-regulating systems, we pay special attention to
what we designate as socio-technical self-regulating systems (SSS).
These are technologies designed to regulate administrative and social
relations in society through combining the AI with other technologies;
in some respects, they are able to perform functions of administrative/
law enforcement bodies.

### Unsustainability---2NC

#### The continued expansion of the technosphere guarantees [planetary immiseration]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline}. It's try or die---any defense of the current system [cannot account]{.underline} for the [computational takeover]{.underline} of [every sphere]{.underline} of life.

**Mbembe, 21**---research professor in history and politics at the Wits
Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of the
Witwatersrand (Achille, "Futures of Life and Futures of Reason," Public
Culture (2021) 33 (1 (93)): 11--33, dml)

Whatever the case, [capital and markets must now be understood as
**magnetic fields** as well as **key determinants** of the climate
system on earth]{.underline}. Furthermore, [whether the old distinction
between the **economic power** of corporations and the **political
sovereignty** of states still holds is **more** and **more open** to
debate]{.underline} (Barkan 2013). [Most global corporations aspire to
**secede** from everybody else while exercising **surveillance** on
everybody else]{.underline}. [Their big dream is to be exempt from taxes
and to be free from accountability]{.underline}; in short, [to enjoy
the]{.underline} kind of [**immunity** and **state of exceptionality**
we used to recognize only in]{.underline} truly **[sovereign
powers]{.underline}**. In a book about what she terms surveillance
capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff (2019) argues that [a **global architecture
of behavior modification** is underway]{.underline}. [Driven by powerful
states]{.underline}, [high-tech corporations]{.underline}, [and military
apparatuses]{.underline}, [surveillance capitalism
**threatens**]{.underline} what she calls "**[human
nature]{.underline}**" in the twenty-first century, just as industrial
capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth. She shows the
extent to which vast wealth is accumulated in what she terms new
"behavioral futures markets," that is, markets where predictions about
our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and
services is subordinated to new technologies of behavioral modification.
Indeed, [capital]{.underline}, especially finance capital, [has become
our **shared infrastructure**]{.underline}, [our **nervous
system**]{.underline}, [the **transcendental maw** that]{.underline}
nowadays [maps out our world and its psycho-physical limits]{.underline}
(Zuboff 2019). To the millennial properties Jean and John Comaroff
highlighted at the start of this century (Comaroff and Comaroff 2000),
capital has now blended the magnetic attributes I have referred to
above.

Around us, [it looks as if **nothing** escapes its control]{.underline}.
**[Affects]{.underline}**, **[emotions]{.underline}**, [and
**feelings**]{.underline}, manifestations of **[desire]{.underline}**,
**[dreams]{.underline}**, [or **thoughts**]{.underline}---[no
sphere]{.underline} of contemporary life has been left untouched by the
spread of capital. No sphere [is **shielded** against its
**atmospheres**]{.underline}, [its **radiation**]{.underline}, [and its
**charged particles**]{.underline}. Capital now extends its grasp deep
into the underbelly of the world (Konings 2018; Edwards, Becker, and
Colwell 2012). [Soon]{.underline}, [mining companies will unleash their
collection of vehicles on the **seabed** beneath international
waters]{.underline}. [They will]{.underline}

creep across the bottom in systematic rows, scraping through the top
five inches of the ocean floor. Ships above will draw thousands of
pounds of sediment through a hose to the surface, remove the metallic
objects, known as polymathic nodules, and then flush the rest back into
the water. Some of that slurry will contain toxins such as mercury and
lead, which could [poison the]{.underline} surrounding [ocean for
**hundreds of miles**]{.underline}. The rest will drift in the current
until it settles in nearby ecosystems. (Hylton 2020)

[Capital itself is now a **magnetic field**]{.underline}. [In its
wake]{.underline}, [it leaves **countless uninhabitable
zones**]{.underline}, [vast fields of **debris** and
**toxins**]{.underline}, [**waste heaps** of humans ravaged by **sores**
and **boils**]{.underline} (Jarrige and Le Roux 2017; Marder 2019). [Now
that **everything** is a potential source of capitalization, capital has
made a world of itself]{.underline}: a hallucinatory phenomenon of
planetary dimensions. Early twenty-first-century corporate sovereignty
is therefore an unprecedented form of power, whose main aspiration is to
free itself from democratic oversight. As a result, [we might no longer
live in an epoch when sovereignty was exercised by the
demos]{.underline} (Brown 2015). Finance [capital in the guise of a
**ubiquitous digital**]{.underline}, **[extractive]{.underline}**, [and
**digestive architecture** might have definitively become the **new
Leviathan**]{.underline} (Bélanger 2018).

Techno-Molecular Colonialism

Meanwhile, [**unprecedented numbers** of human beings are]{.underline}
today [embedded in **increasingly complex
technostructures**]{.underline}, most of [which are intervening in the
dynamics of the earth system on a **planetary scale**]{.underline}.
[This has led to the **transgression of planetary boundaries** such
as]{.underline} those related to anthropogenic **[climate
change]{.underline}**, [degenerative **land-use change**]{.underline},
[accelerated **biodiversity loss**]{.underline}, [perturbation of the
global]{.underline} biogeochemical [cycles of **nitrogen** and
**phosphorus**]{.underline}, [and the creation and release
of]{.underline} novel entities such as [**nanoparticles** and
**genetically engineered organisms**]{.underline} (Donges et al. 2017).
[It has also resulted in the acceleration of processes of]{.underline}
metamorphosis, **[decay]{.underline}**, [and
**extinction**]{.underline}. Take, for instance, the metabolic life of
whey powder, a pollutant in waterways and a multiplicitous substance
used over the past two decades as a protein supplement in a
multibillion-dollar industry. As demonstrated by Samantha King and Gavin
Weedon (2019), whey pollution has long been the effect of the systematic
overproduction endemic to agrofood industries. Whey\'s toxicity is known
to persist through processes of metabolism and consumption. This not
only highlights the co-constitutive relations between bodily matter and
ecological life, and their entanglement with processes of
commodification (King and Weedon 2019); it also shows the extent to
which [the **technosphere** is a part]{.underline}, or an extension, [of
the **biosphere**]{.underline}. [Flows of matter]{.underline}, [energy,
and information are **combined** into complex networks and intricate
webs of interactions]{.underline}. As a result, the body and flesh of
the world is expanding. In the process, [the earth is being
**redefined** in a way that **binds all species together**]{.underline}:
[humans]{.underline}, [technology]{.underline}, [animals]{.underline},
[fungi]{.underline}, [plants]{.underline}, [viruses]{.underline},
[bacteria]{.underline}---[the same life in disparate bodies]{.underline}
(Laubichler 2019).

Over the last decade, [numerous algorithmic forms of intelligence have
been developed]{.underline} (Amoore and Piotukh 2020). Many are inspired
by the natural world and by ideas of natural selection and evolution.
Such is the case of genetic algorithms---a subset of evolutionary
algorithms that "mimic actions inspired in biological operators, such as
cells." They "seek to optimize the responses to the problems of their
environments by self-generating, and encompassing processes of mutation
and natural selection" (Pasquinelli 2015). As Margarida Mendes (2017)
powerfully argues, [a **shifting redistribution** of powers between the
human and the technological is unfolding]{.underline}.
[Technologies]{.underline}, in turn, [are **increasingly
tied**]{.underline} both metabolically and reproductively [into complex
networks of **extraction** and **predation**]{.underline}. Mendes shows
the extent to which [the genetic codes of humans]{.underline},
[plants]{.underline}, [and animals are being **cracked** and
**disseminated**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [is giving
way to an exponential rise of biological patents]{.underline}. [The
human genome is in the process of being **privately
owned**]{.underline}.

[Life itself is **more** and **more perceived** as a **commodity** to be
replicated under the volatility of market consumption]{.underline}.
Mendes goes on to show how [**thousands** of new molecules whose
behavior cannot be predicted are **produced** and **released** into the
ecosystem]{.underline}. [Seeds]{.underline}, [chemical
herbicides]{.underline}, [GMOs]{.underline}, [and pesticides are
patented by a handful of multinationals]{.underline}, she adds. [Through
widespread genetic modification of key elements in the food
chain]{.underline}, [corporations are **intervening directly** in the
natural cycles of life and ecosystems]{.underline}. [Patented GMO genes
are **absorbed** into human bodies and]{.underline} the bodies of
various [other species]{.underline}, turning the latter into
infrastructures and [inscribing them into a **proprietary relationship
of biological subjugation**]{.underline}, she concludes.

As algorithmic forms of intelligence grow in parallel to (and often in
alliance with) genetic research, the integration of algorithms and
big-data analysis in the biological sphere brings with it a greater
belief in techno-positivism. More and more, statistical thought, regimes
of assessment of the natural world, modes of prediction, and analysis
treat matter and life itself as finite and computable objects. The idea
that life might be an open, nonlinear, and exponentially chaotic system
is increasingly behind us. We seem to have reached a point where the
market is reimagined as the primary mechanism for the validation of
truth. Since markets themselves are increasingly turning into
algorithmic structures, the only useful knowledge today is supposed to
be algorithmic. Instead of actual human beings with body, history, and
flesh, big data and statistical inferences are all that count, and both
are mostly derived from computation.

Through big data in particular, surveillance is expanded into the
emotional registers of domestic and embodied experience. As Kirstie Ball
and William Webster (2020) have argued, a nexus of the potential of
analysts, the data practices themselves, and the newly configured
intimate spheres is increasingly drawn into the commercial value chain
(Ball and Webster 2020). Data extraction is itself a political economic
regime driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation (Sadowski
2020).

For Matteo Pasquinelli (2015), algorithmic reason is a form of
rationality whose end is the understanding of vast amounts of data
according to a specific vector, the recording of emerging properties,
and the forecasting of tendencies. To some extent, the metadata society
is characterized by the "accumulation of information about information."
Algorithms also mine metadata for the purpose of establishing patterns
of behavior, detecting anomalies, and recognizing an enemy. The enemy is
constructed as a reality via statistics, modeling, and mathematics.
Power, thus, is increasingly about identifying patterns or connections
in random data, in a context in which the opposition between information
and knowledge, knowledge and data, data and image, and thinking and
seeing appears to collapse.

Power, detection, and surveillance are nevertheless not all. Algorithms
are interwoven with a multiplicity of relations and heterogeneous
things, be they data, bodies, or objects (Amoore 2020). In this sense,
they are in themselves a negotiated process. Their power derives from
their capacity to dynamically combine and recombine them and in so doing
to reconfigure different social and material heterogeneities (Burke
2019; Lee and Björklund Larsen 2017). How they fold and unfold these
relations, and with what effects, is an open-ended matter.

Computational and [algorithmic logic is now found at the **very source
of general perception**]{.underline}. As a result of the conflation of
knowledge, computation, and markets, contempt has been extended to
anyone who has nothing to sell and nothing to buy, or anything that
cannot be bought and sold. [It is therefore **correct** to argue that
there is a **shifting distribution of powers** between the human and the
technological]{.underline}, in the sense that [technologies are moving
toward]{.underline} "**[general intelligence]{.underline}**" [and
**self-replication**]{.underline}. [They are being granted the powers of
**reproduction** and **independent**]{.underline} teleonomic
**[purpose]{.underline}** rather than having them taken away.

Key to life futures is therefore the extent to which [technological
escalation has **redefined** the nature of speed]{.underline},
[unshackled markets]{.underline}, [and the economy]{.underline}.
Important, too, are the ways in which [various technological devices
**constantly monitor** our behavior in attempts to reveal how it could
be **modified** and **optimized**]{.underline}. As a matter of fact,
[some of the **fastest-expanding markets** in the world today
are]{.underline} "[markets for **future behavior**]{.underline}." They
rely on better understanding incipient future intent. This could be
future voting intentions. It could also be the intent to commit fraud,
the intent to buy life insurance, or the intent to stream a specific
video (Amoore 2019). [These markets also rely on the **extraction** and
**mining** of new forms of **raw material**]{.underline}. Such raw
material mostly consists of [**information** and **details** about
individuals' behavior]{.underline} taken, as Zuboff (2019) writes, from
the distant corners of our unconscious. It is raw material [plumbed from
**intimate patterns** of the self]{.underline}---our personality, our
moods, our emotions, our lies, our vulnerabilities, every level of our
intimacy (Zuboff 2019; Illouz 2007). [The purpose is]{.underline} not
only to heighten the predictability of our behavior. It is also [to make
**life itself** amenable to datafication]{.underline}.

[A **key feature** of our times is]{.underline} therefore [the extent to
which **all** societies are organized according to the **same
principle**]{.underline}---[the **computational**]{.underline}. [We are
**surrounded** by ubiquitous computing]{.underline}, [technologies that
weave themselves into the fabric of our everyday lives]{.underline};
these devices, sensors, and other things we interact with have become
part of our presence in the world all the time. How the boundary between
us and these devices is enacted is a matter of open debate (Matzner
2019).

But what is the computational? The computational is generally understood
as a technical system whose function is to capture, extract, and
automatically process data that must be identified, selected, sorted,
classified, recombined, codified, and activated. Yet we shouldn\'t
forget that the computational is also a force and energy of a special
kind, a speed regime with its own qualities and infrastructures. It
produces and serializes subjects, objects, and phenomena; splits reason
from consciousness and memory; and codes and stores data that can be
used to manufacture new types of services and devices sold for profit.

Whether operating on bodies, nerves, material, blood, cellular tissues,
the brain, or energy, [the aim is]{.underline} the same: [the conversion
of all substances into **quantities**]{.underline}; [the conversion of
organic and vital ends into **technical means**]{.underline}; [the
**capture** of forces and possibilities]{.underline}, [and their
**annexation** by the language of a machine-brain transformed into an
**autonomous** and **automated system**]{.underline} (Friederich 2020;
Perény 2013). The computational is also the institution through which a
common world, a new common sense, and new configurations of power,
perception, and reality are nowadays brought into being. [The
**globalization** of corporate sovereignty]{.underline}, [the extension
of capital into **every sphere of life**]{.underline}, [and
**technological escalation** in the form of the computational are
all]{.underline} part of one and [the **same process**]{.underline}.

The Dialectics of Entanglement and Separation

The third megaprocess is what we should call the dialectics of
entanglement and separation. [All over the world]{.underline}, [the
combination of **fossil capital**]{.underline}, **[soft-power
warfare]{.underline}**, [and the **saturation** of the everyday by
digital]{.underline} and computational [technologies has led
to]{.underline} the acceleration of speed and the intensification of
connections, creating [a **new redistribution** of the earth and of
population movements]{.underline}. To be alive, or to remain alive, is
increasingly tantamount to being able to move speedily.

[In the process]{.underline}, [the human race has come up against
**terrestrial limits**]{.underline}. Such limits are not only the
consequence of the sphericality of the planet. [They are]{.underline}
also [limitations on the **expansion of life** as such]{.underline}. [As
the planet increasingly seems **bound to burn**]{.underline}, [it is not
only **individuated bodies** that are imperiled]{.underline}. [It is
**earthly existence**]{.underline}, [the fate of **everything** on
earth]{.underline}, [the **fluidity of life** that is at
stake]{.underline} (Pyne 1995; Parisi and Terranova 2000).

### Link---AI---Competition/Leadership/Primacy

#### AI dominance is [neo-Darwinian digital colonialism]{.underline}.

**Adams, 21**---Information Law and Policy Centre, Institute of Advanced
Legal Studies, University of London (Rachel, "Can artificial
intelligence be decolonized?," Interdisciplinary Science Reviews,
46:1-2, 176-197, dml)

In the totality of its machinic, computational, and imaginary
manifestations, **[A]{.underline}**rtificial
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence [is **structurally**]{.underline},
**[systematically]{.underline}**, [and **psychologically altering** not
only]{.underline} local and global **[society,]{.underline}** [but what
it means to be **human**]{.underline}, or, to be counted as such.
Accounts such as James Williams' on the attention economy that detail
how [digital technologies function at a **neurological level** to
capture and coax human impulses]{.underline} (2018); Brett Frischmann
and Evan Selinger's analysis of how [AI will]{.underline} not replace
humanity but rather **[re-engineer us as computable]{.underline}**
(2018); and Shoshana Zuboff's work on surveillance capitalism that
explicates a new world order where [human behaviour has become the
**commodity** of capitalist extraction]{.underline} (2018), all provide
examples of how advanced technologies associated with AI are working at
deep and complex levels in ways that are radically redefining what it
means to be human.

Yet none of these texts, which constitute some of the leading work in
the field, take into account the complex genealogy of intelligence:
whose conception of intelligence is modelled within technology or how
the idea has been put to work in dividing people between the desired and
the undesirable. Nor the history of the human body as machine and
commodity borne from slavery and colonialism, such that Achille Mbembe
names blackness as the prototype for the assemblage of the human--object
of modernity (2017, 2019). Nor the ways in which [the **knowledges**
upon which AI is built]{.underline} -- [**statistical enumeration** of
people and land]{.underline} -- [were advanced by **imperial powers** to
**control** and **contain colonial populations**]{.underline} (Appadurai
1993; Breckenridge 2014; Kalpagam 2000, 2014; Said 1978), [and led to
the development of **cybernetics** and **eugenics**]{.underline}, as
well as the idea that, through feedback mechanisms, both human and
machine can be corrected and improved.

Indeed, for Mbembe we are encountering a third shift in the arrangement
of race and blackness in global society: the first being slavery and
colonization; the second being the development of writing and text,
culminating in the formal processes of decolonization; and the third
being the advent, proliferation, and ubiquity of digital technologies
which represent the latest phase of highmodernity (2017). Similarly, for
Aníbal Quijano, [we are reaching a **watershed moment** in the global
coloniality of power]{.underline}, with 'the manipulation and control of
technological resources of communication and of transportation in order
to impose the technocratization/instrumentalization of
Coloniality/modernity' (2017, 364), together with 'the mercantilization
of subjectivity and life experiences of individuals' (2017, 365).

AI, too, is in the midst of reconciling three forms of discontent,1
whose relation to the forms of coloniality and the historical
construction of race at work in the world today has yet to be fully
understood. First, manifest racial and gender bias within AI
technologies (Benjamin 2019; Buolamwini and Gebru 2018; Keyes 2018;
Noble 2018). In June 2020, E. Tendayi Achiume, United Nations Special
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia, and related intolerance, issued a report to the United
Nations Human Rights Council that found '[emerging digital technologies
**exacerbate** and **compound** existing inequalities]{.underline}, many
of which exist along racial, ethnic and national origin grounds'
(paragraph 4). The second discontent, echoing Quijano's description of
the mercantilization of life, regards the way [AI and digital
technologies are **globally commoditizing** human
experience]{.underline} (Zuboff 2018). Within this data paradigm, [the
human is **substituted** as an assemblage of their data points which
are]{.underline}, in turn, [taken as a sign of the real]{.underline}
(Baudrillard 1994). The third discontent is geopolitical, pertaining to
[the emergence of an **arms race** characterized by the ambitions of
transatlantic nation states to be]{.underline} '**[global
leaders]{.underline}**' (Vladimir Putin, cited in Vincent 2017) in AI
innovation (Garvey 2019).2 This, together with the second discontent,
[is **central** to]{.underline} the ideas of 'data colonialism' and
'**[digital colonialism]{.underline}**' naming, within current AI
discourse, [the **brazen flurry** to extract and exploit]{.underline}
personal [data]{.underline} and data systems (Birhane 2019; Couldry and
Mejias 2019; Crawford et al. 2019; Ricaurte 2019; Mhlambi 2020). [It
relates]{.underline} as well [to]{.underline} Ian Hogarth's critique of
'**[AI nationalism]{.underline}**' [where new dependencies are being
**tacitly enforced** between low-tech and advanced-tech states and are
set to follow the **historical divide** of **Global
North/South**]{.underline} (2018). Perhaps more critically, [the drive
to **dominate**]{.underline} in the production and use of [**AI** is
revealing of the project's **hegemonic impulses**]{.underline}, [and the
**neo-Darwinian linearity**]{.underline} of the evolution of science
[which will]{.underline} '**[leave behind]{.underline}**' [those who
**do not conform** to catching up]{.underline}. In light of these
concerns, Mbembe's provocation to critique the apparatuses of race and
blackness in digital technologies, and Quijano's warning against the
hegemony of technocratization which encompasses, at once, the
consolidation of modes of commodification of the human-object, becomes
ever more urgent.

### Link---AI---Ethics/Governance/Norms

#### Their appeal to new ethical norms for AI governance [epistemologically figures]{.underline} the West as the colonial master of the planet.

**Adams, 21**---Information Law and Policy Centre, Institute of Advanced
Legal Studies, University of London (Rachel, "Can artificial
intelligence be decolonized?," Interdisciplinary Science Reviews,
46:1-2, 176-197, dml)

In 2019, [a study was published]{.underline} in Nature [identifying
**over 84** ethical standards for the use and development of
AI]{.underline} developed globally in the last five years (Jobin, Ienca,
and Vayena 2019; Ulnicane et al., this issue). Despite being titled 'The
Global Landscape of AI Ethics Guidelines,' amongst these 84 AI ethics
standards, **[none]{.underline}** listed [are from the **African
continent** or]{.underline} even [the **Global South**]{.underline}.
[Most were developed in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, UK [or by **international
institutions**]{.underline}. Mohamed, Png, and Isaac (2020) similarly
note how **[national AI policies]{.underline}** or strategies [are
almost **exclusively** found in the **Global North**]{.underline}, and
[where efforts to develop a national policy around AI are arising
in]{.underline} countries within [the Global South]{.underline}, [this
is being driven by **supra-state bodies**]{.underline} such as the World
Economic Forum. [As **ethical benchmarks**]{.underline}, [these
standards are **paternalistically positioned** as
**universal**]{.underline}: applicable for all, everywhere. In addition,
[the]{.underline} scientific [practice of promoting **ethical AI**
through strengthening or testing the]{.underline}
'**[fairness]{.underline}**' [of AI systems]{.underline} (the extent to
which they exhibit social biases, in particular) [performs a **similar
conceit** in presuming the scene of the Global South]{.underline} -- or
more specifically in this case, the African region -- [to be a place
where]{.underline} '**[ethics]{.underline}**,' as such, [is **yet to be
fully established**]{.underline}. Now a well-documented case (Ballim and
Breckenridge 2018; Arun 2020; Arun 2020), in 2018, when the issue of
racial bias and the non-recognition of Black faces by AI-driven facial
recognition technologies was peaking following the work of Buolamwini
and Gebru (2018),13 a Chinese facial recognition company signed a deal
with the Zimbabwean government for access the records of the national
population registry, which contained facial imagery of millions of
Zimbabweans, to train the company's algorithmic technologies to better
recognize Black faces. By reducing the potential for bias, the system
would ultimately be more ethical. While Ballim and Breckenridge (2018)
condemn this incident for exploiting the inadequate data protection
provisions in Zimbabwean law, it is not all that different from [the
practice of **beta-testing**]{.underline} newly developed [AI systems in
African countries]{.underline} (Mohamed, Png, and Isaac 2020). Calling
it 'ethics-dumping,' Mohamed, Png, and Isaac point to the notorious
company Cambridge Analytica as exemplar, in that it developed
algorithmic systems for use in the US and UK by beta-testing them in
Nigeria and Kenya (2020, 11). This [follows the now **centuries-old
colonial conceit** of]{.underline} what Jan Smuts euphemistically called
[the]{.underline} '**[laboratory of Africa]{.underline}**' (1930),
[where the collateral damage of scientific advancement could be **safely
externalized** to places and people considered expendable]{.underline}
(see Bonneuil 2000; Tilley 2011; Taylor 2019). Moreover, [the
epistemological foundations of AI **cannot be extricated**
from]{.underline} Francis Galton's work in [the development of
statistics]{.underline} -- particularly on inference, regression,
correlation, and the normal distribution curve -- which arose out of his
explorations in Southern Africa, where he applied his statistical
science to native populations in order [to measure human differences and
intelligence]{.underline} (Breckenridge 2014, Chapter 1).

In these instances, [the idea of]{.underline} '[ethics]{.underline}' [is
situated as the **supreme value** of the Occident]{.underline}, [to be
**proselytized** on the Africa region]{.underline}, [which
is]{.underline}, in turn, and [in relation to the]{.underline}
'**[ethical West]{.underline}**,' [positioned as]{.underline}
'**[pre-ethical]{.underline}**' (Mbembe 2017, 49) -- as [a **world
apart**]{.underline}. Indeed, [that Europe believed itself to
be]{.underline} '**[helping]{.underline}**' and 'protecting' [its
African colonies constituted the **central creed** of the civilizing
mission of **colonialism**]{.underline} (Césaire 2001); as Spivak
reminds us, [ethics]{.underline} '[**served** and **serves**
as]{.underline} \[[its]{.underline}\] [**energetic** and **successful
defense**]{.underline}' (1988, 5). Yet [as ethics was put to work to
**justify** both the civilizing mission of **colonialism** and the
utilization of Africa as a **laboratory** for Western scientific
progress]{.underline}, [it enacted another conceit of the colonial order
of things]{.underline}: [that Western reason is
**neutral**]{.underline}, **[universal]{.underline}**, [and
**objective**]{.underline}; [that it could be **dislocated** from the
context in which it arose and **applied elsewhere**]{.underline}.
[Positioned as a]{.underline} '**[point zero]{.underline}**' (Santiago
Castro-Gomez unpublished work, cited in Grosfugal 2011, 6) [from which
to survey the world]{.underline}, [Western knowledge and rationality
claimed ascendency as the **only real way** of knowing and understanding
the world]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} a critical problematic
within decolonial thought (Grosfoguel 2007; Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2013), and
[a **central assumption** within AI]{.underline}: [that intelligence and
the production of knowledge can be outsourced to a machine
**presupposes** such knowledge to be both **separable** from the context
in which it was produced and **applicable** to other contexts and
realities]{.underline}.

### Link---AI---Generic

#### The aff removes the [final barrier]{.underline} to the cybernetic takeover of warfare. 

**Ford and Gould, 21**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of Sussex; Lecturer in the Future of Conflict in the
Defence Studies Department at King's College London (Matthew and
Alexander, "From warrior geek to prototype warrior: entrepreneurialism,
future war, and the emergence of twenty-first century civil-military
relations," Digital War, Volume 2, 35--50 (2021), dml)

[Armed forces across the world are]{.underline} now [engaged in a race
to **exploit**]{.underline} the technologies emerging from the fourth
industrial revolution.1 The application of **[AI]{.underline}** in
military affairs is one example; the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to sift and analyse data patterns raises the possibility that [strategic
level military decision making might be **sped up**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} if AI can be repurposed for battlefield equipment, [it
might become possible to **remove humans**]{.underline} from targeting
loops [and create **fully autonomous** weapon systems]{.underline}. Both
of these applications could have the potential to 'becom\[e\] critical
force multipliers in future military capabilities'.2

[Despite their ambition]{.underline}, [defence establishments
have]{.underline} nonetheless [**struggled** to develop and implement
these technologies **on their own**]{.underline}. Innovation in AI is
primarily being developed by private sector companies like Google,
Amazon, Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Facebook (Webb 2019). Unfortunately
for the US military, several of these Silicon Valley businesses,
including Google, have balked at the possibility of working on defence
contracts.3 However, as Eric Schmidt observes, the AI systems that might
help make sense of the vast amounts of data that organisations like the
US Department of Defense (DoD) collect cannot be made to work without
accessing commercial enterprise-wide cloud computing in complex
information stacks.4 Problematically, [the skills necessary]{.underline}
to develop state-of-the-art information stacks [have **not been readily
available** within]{.underline} American or **[NATO]{.underline}**
governments.5 As a result, a number of niche entrepreneurs backed by
venture capital or recently floated businesses have sought to fill the
gap and work through the challenge of applying AI to defence data.

In trying to develop solutions to these challenges it has become
apparent to Silicon Valley businesses like Anduril that traditional
models of government bureaucracy must be redesigned to account for
activities focused on software rather than hardware.6 At its simplest,
this might start with changing procurement practices away from buying
platforms and the associated technical support to instead acquiring
subscription services from defence innovators wedded to constant cycles
of software upgrades and deeper levels of systems integration. As these
changes become more sophisticated government business models can be
redesigned to use 'data analytics specialists \[to\] help \[government\]
more rigorously evaluate policy successes and delivery failures'.7 [This
presents **opportunities** for]{.underline} those Silicon Valley
[**businesses** who are prepared to work with defence and help
**redesign government** around]{.underline} the collection, analysis and
exploitation of **[data]{.underline}** (Christiansson 2018). The
shareholder benefits that might be realised by these changes has led
Palantir, one of the largest mainstream companies willing to work with
defence, to state in their 2020 Initial Public Offering that a key goal
was for their software to 'become the default operating system...across
the U.S. government'.8

[Leveraging innovations in AI for military purposes does]{.underline}
therefore [imply the **remodelling** of government
bureaucracy]{.underline}. On the face of it, this appears to reflect
longstanding trends in organisational change and the adoption of new
technology. It is our contention, however, that these changes demand a
more detailed reflection on the complex, opaque and poorly understood
**[information infrastructures]{.underline}** that underpin military
culture and civil-military relations (CMR). Benjamin H. Bratton, for
example, argues that relations between systems, service providers,
technologists and the underlying hardware constitute 'alternative
geometr\[ies\] of political geography'. These, he contends [must be
mapped if the **power relations**]{.underline} of these new 'information
infrastructures' [are to be rendered transparent]{.underline} (Bratton
2016; Bowker et al 2010). Taking our cue from Bratton, this article
looks to map these alternate geometries of power as framed by CMR and
the emerging sets of practice that have come to knit together defence
establishments and high-technology industries in military innovation. In
doing so, we point towards a new potential 'gap' (Rahbek-Clemmensen et
al. 2012) in CMR, one where [military innovation is forging a **new
martial culture** that has the potential to place **strains** on the
legitimate use of armed force]{.underline} (McDonald 2021).

### Link---Biotech---Environment/Resources

#### Narrativizing biotechnology as humanity's savior legitimizes a [global biopolitics]{.underline} that understands life through the prism of [technical control]{.underline}.

**Tamminen and Deibel, 19**---Adjunct Professor of Science and
Technology Studies (Anthropology of Science and Technology) at the
University of Helsinki; lectures STS to engineering students at Bilkent
University (Sakari and Eric, "Recoding life: information and the
biopolitical," *Recoding Life: Information and the Biopolitical*,
Chapter 1, 3-7, dml)

The [recent developments in genetic engineering]{.underline} tools,
knowledge, and their use in improving species of life [are]{.underline}
only the logical continuation of the historical trajectory of biology
and biosciences. Gradually the question about finding the 'truth' about
life has shifted toward a question about the utility of such techniques
in [making life forms perform]{.underline} a particular task [in a
**more efficient**]{.underline}, [**optimised** way]{.underline}. This
is a result of 'the century of the gene' ( Fox Keller 2000 ), brought to
us [via new innovations for the manipulation of life]{.underline} both
intra-cellular and extra-cellular [and through **particular
biopolitics** reframed around the optimisation of]{.underline} not only
the individual and the species but [the way in which individuals and
species **develop**]{.underline}, **[perform]{.underline}**, [and
**regulate** themselves]{.underline} (or not). Such biopolitics
targeting life not as it is but how it should be is a question of
interests, or, rather, it is a politics of interests that fundamentally
defines how the 'code of life' will be compiled and executed at intra-
and extra-cellular levels across species and taxa (see Foucault 2002 ).

This book examines how genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and
different life forms being generated constitute the emerging forms of
life of the early twenty-first century's global culture ( Fischer 2003
). Here, 'life', and truth about [life]{.underline}, [is increasingly
verified within a field of competing interests where their **value** and
**utility** is premised on the **fading** of species bodies and their
borders]{.underline}. Accordingly, bodies of knowing, their techniques,
their governance, and the very ways of speaking about life and its
representation are reshaping the capacity for optimisation and their
exchange value, many times called the sphere of the neoliberal
'bio-economy' or, occasionally, biocapitalism (see Sunder Rajan 2006 ;
Cooper 2008 ; Helmreich 2008 ). Life in the form of informational media
( Thacker 2003 ) should be understood as a newly framed matter of
concern ( Latour 2004 ) that arises from how bio-objects are being
assigned vital functions and powers holding utility value and,
therefore, potential value in exchange ( Vermeulen et al. 2012 ).

All this is true, yet the framing and regulation of such emergent forms
of life is always already a subject of a global politics of interest,
wherein [**power** is negotiated through particular configurations
**entrenched** in the deep will to explore the limits of life's
value]{.underline}. [This signals a regenesis]{.underline} not only of
life but [of a **global biopolitics** co-constituted through the
metacodes of life]{.underline}: revealed through its discourses,
techniques, circuits, and their intersections alongside the interactions
that support particular types of forms of research, exchange, and
governance.

Exploring metacodes

The idiom of exploration is omnipresent throughout the life sciences,
and there is always a multiplicity of objectives to accomplish and at
stake. Crucially, the question of life -- molecular, genetic, synthetic,
and beyond -- is fundamentally unstable. An example of this is how these
objectives are imagined by the authors of the breakthrough report on the
completion of the map of the human genome. In their celebratory article
announcing the complete map, the International Human Genome Sequencing
Consortium on Initial Sequencing and Analysis of the Human Genome quoted
T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets (15 February 2001, Nature 409). Looking
beyond their publication on the human genome, they concluded:

Finally, it has not escaped our notice that the more we learn about the
human genome, the more there is to explore: We shall not cease from
exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we
started. And know the place for the first time.

As expected, the initial completion of the map did not end the
exploration. Instead, the decade and a half that has passed since has
shown an exponential growth in mappings: numerous species of mammal,
plant, bacterium, and so forth or microbial genomes containing billions
of base pairs have been charted and mapped into databases. Moreover, the
practise of mapping as a means of generating 'basic knowledge' has
turned into a practise of modelling the increasingly complex behaviour
of genes, proteins, and cells. Laboratories and infrastructures around
the world are expanding, facilitating the exchange of information,
instantaneously, for diverse purposes, in what is best characterised as
an industry informed by biological science and seeking to re-materialise
the information through genetic engineering.

Therefore, it was certainly appropriate that the authors of the report
claimed that there is always more to explore, but what they suggest is
that the end is 'to arrive where we started'. This refers to the subject
of the exploration as life itself: its inner workings mapped and
revealed by science imagined as a domain with a beginning that always
already was an end in itself. In this sense, the advance of the life
sciences moves from an ahistorical past towards a horizon that is
constantly being reached, moving towards the realisation of the promise
of a future in which technique subdues life and nature. Such an
exploration goes onwards (there is always more to explore) as if it is
only a matter of time before the furthest extent of knowledge arrives
where it started: it is premised on a transhistorical understanding that
is a crucial feature of what we call the metacode of life . In a
sentence, the metacode of life refers to the centrality of DNA in
informatic formats as the condition of the contemporary politics of how
the biological informs the digital and vice versa .

Maps are powerful techniques for representing worlds or spatiotemporal
configurations of specific relationships between human and other beings
that are not created out of nothing or only life itself. Maps are
exemplary, as already observed by Donna Haraway when she stated that
'maps are models of worlds crafted through and for specific practices of
intervening and ways of life' ( Haraway 1997 , 135). In this sense, the
exploration imagined by the authors of the report on the human genome
project -- whose aim 'to arrive where we started' -- suggests that once
'life's inner workings are mapped and revealed by science', biology as
the logos of bio will have been transformed, questioned, re-articulated
once again. We will mark such transhistorical understandings as
metacodes of life , as a starting point and structure from which to
rethink DNA as information and embodied forms as they are explored and
mapped in ways that mediate spaces, relationships, and actors through
time.

The citation that marked the completion of the map of the human genome
is particularly telling, as its lines taken from T.S. Eliot's Four
Quartets refer to Dante and his story about the emissary of the living
who was guided by Virgil and Beatrice among the dead. The passage cited
underscores the continuous nature of exploration and refers to a
mystical interconnection of the past, present, and future. Such a
perspective on the first completed map of the human genome implies an
exploration that similarly breaks free from the boundaries of previous
journeys. In this case, it is an exploration of 'the human' and its
'limited-edition formats' such as the 'body'. The analogy changes the
kind of exploration and what is at stake. It includes Inferno,
Purgatory, and Paradise rather than an easy choice between heaven and
hell or between salvation through the inventions of the life sciences
and damnation through genetic engineering becoming like Frankenstein: 'a
thing such as even Dante could not have conceived' (Shelley \[1818\]
2006 , 61).

[We are told]{.underline}, [**again** and **again**]{.underline}, [about
how new technologies will deliver us **more food**]{.underline},
**[health]{.underline}**, [and **wealth** and improve the
**soil**]{.underline}, [even the **weather**]{.underline}. Soon
**[everyone will win]{.underline}**, [when the life sciences realise
their promise]{.underline} as drivers of knowledge economies -- [as a
**global bio-economy**]{.underline}; a knowledge-based bio-economy; a
biobased economy; or similar arrangements wherein ecology, economy, and
biology find each other. Following these guides means that [we are
presented with]{.underline} a journey that is about [genetic exploration
that has as its end a sustainable future that]{.underline} is reached by
realising the long list of innovations in every imaginable area that
[will guarantee]{.underline} employment and sustainability without
compromising our **[agricultural productivity]{.underline}**, **[global
food security]{.underline}**, focus on **[renewable
energy]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} potential [solutions to
**climate change**]{.underline} (see Chapter 7 ).

Sometimes this type of 'end' to the exploration is presented as a myth
of origins: a return to the mists of time when everything was always
already 'bio-based' rather than the fossil resources that power today's
industrialised civilisation. This is a painting of a lost Arcadia
wherein only biological resources were used for food, shelter,
transportation, and so on (see Veraart et al. 2011 ). Mostly, however,
historical continuity needs to be re-established in the present, which
invariably means that [the commercialisation of the biological sciences
is a premise for the **extensive wish list** attached to the usage of
sustainable and renewable biological resources]{.underline}. On one
hand, the 'end' of the exploration is taking on the shape of a
comprehensive alternative, with the life sciences as the driver of a
systemic transition to a world wherein societies are revitalised after
suffering economic crises, along with their citizens, who are in harmony
with themselves, each other, and natural environments.

On the other hand, the counter-narratives mirror the increasing
magnitude of the story, as found in many of the policy documents on the
life sciences and the knowledge economy. Instead of harmony and the
unity of science, society, and nature, [this is a discourse of
**conflict** and **competition** looming in the near
future]{.underline}, [when **resources**]{.underline} (such as water and
land) [will be at stake]{.underline}, [new sectors will **displace**
others]{.underline} (as with fuel and food), [and]{.underline} the
fortune of nations might need to be guaranteed by various means as
[**entire continents** surge ahead or fall behind]{.underline}
(discussed in Chapter 7 ). Underneath the heavenly vision of new
biological, economic, and ecological harmony [we find a **hell** that is
populated with the **same characters** that are held responsible for the
loss of nature's integrity]{.underline}: **[new
monocrops]{.underline}**, **[big pharma]{.underline}**, **[big
data]{.underline}**, [and the **plundering of biological
wealth**]{.underline}.

While two diametrically opposed conclusions are being drawn in looking
at [the biological future]{.underline}, both [are narrated as a
**sweeping** and **dramatic epic** with **geopolitical
consequences**]{.underline}. In this sense, they are perfectly
symmetrical in their focus on the need to overcome planetary constraints
and in their agreement about how humans will have to act as a species,
and at a scale that matches that of the numerous global crises of the
present. At the centre of both stories [we find a **reverence** for the
desire and drive to **overcome** whatever limits there are to life as a
technological creation and to **redesign** species bodies at
will]{.underline}. After all, each appeals to a 'return to nature',
which assumes that the journey has an end that, whether good or bad, is
premised on a logical coherency that is simply not there, neither in the
knowledge about DNA nor in the political philosophies about the natural
world and human nature (see Hayles 1999 ; Žižek 1999 ; cf. Fukuyama 2002
; Habermas 2003 ).

What could be more appropriate for the contemporary life sciences than
how an emissary of the living is guided through the rings of hell,
purgatory, and heaven? Certainly, the guides are different, but even
without Dante and his guides, [the end]{.underline} to the exploration
[is]{.underline} still [a cosmological order wherein **everything is
assigned the right place**]{.underline} -- this time being [reconfigured
**biologically**]{.underline}, **[genetically]{.underline}**, [or by
**informatic patterns** encompassing all living beings]{.underline}.
Once again [we get to bear witness to]{.underline} a renewal of
[practises of]{.underline} identifying, **[observing]{.underline}**,
**[classifying]{.underline}**, **[ordering]{.underline}**, representing,
analysing, redoing, [and **rerouting life** and **death**]{.underline},
the living and the non-living. This time we follow guides who suggest
that there is a new era of techniques of life, thereby establishing a
type of continuity that spans from Dante's vision to today, passing by
Diderot's Encyclopédie and more recently Wikipedia and the human genome
as a repository of knowledge of what humans are. Each in its own way has
been an effort to incorporate all of the knowledge scattered over the
surface of the earth, showing a continuity in technique, skill, tools,
and techné -- each pointing to technology as an enduring part of what it
means to be Homo sapiens , as individuals and as a species.

#### The aff facilitates the global transformation of bodies into [biomedia]{.underline}.

University (Sakari and Eric, "Read, write, standardise," *Recoding Life:

In the late 1960s, Marshall McLuhan proclaimed that [in a near
future]{.underline} -- in a future [that resembles to a **terrible
degree** our global contemporary present]{.underline} --
[the]{.underline} narcissist [tendency of humankind to continuously seek
the **most perfect image** of itself would drive the species toward
**existential discontent**]{.underline}. According to McLuhan,
[this]{.underline} narcissist appetite [would drive a desire to seek a
**constant**]{.underline} '**[upgrade of the self]{.underline}**',
[which]{.underline}, in turn, [would lead to an **anthropological
narcosis**]{.underline} manifested through a numbness of the primary
senses. [This **numbness**]{.underline}, then, [would be a consequence
of the different technologies developed to extend our
senses]{.underline} beyond what the body normally would be capable of
doing, experiencing, and expressing. His underlying suggestion was that
technologies create and operate within a space of the new media that is
a reaction to a deep existential discomfort, experienced through the
pains and sicknesses of the body -- an anthropological experience of
deep-running dissatisfaction. For him, [diverse technologies developed
to enhance our senses and the functions of the body would equate
to]{.underline} technological prostheses and [**amputation**
of]{.underline} the primary bodily functions -- and, more generally,
[our intentions as **embodied beings**]{.underline}.

The flickering face on the water, as the story goes, was so captivating
that all else in life seemed meaningless for Narcissus. [A similar
tendency]{.underline} of autoeroticism [can be witnessed in the
**bioscience research** pursuing the ultimate truth about various
species via their genetic makeup]{.underline}, [in the
**technoscientific enterprises** driving the development of the bodily
and informatic capacities of our species body]{.underline}. And the face
is not just reflected but also subjected, such that for the first time
we become aware how we, as individuals and species, are equipped with a
large number of technological extensions of the body. At the same time,
and beyond extensions, we also have developed externalised intentions
placing our identities outside our embodied being -- our mind is being
increasingly redistributed in its material and informatics senses (
Hutchins 1995 ), while our bodies are extended with numerous
technologies of life.

This dual recognition stems from the fact that biological bodies
themselves are both a medium of coded functions that run inside cells,
guided by instruction sets (in DNA), AND a source of numerous unknown
bits of information to be decoded for new biotechnological pursuits

\[b\]y putting our physical bodies inside our extended nervous systems,
by means of electric media, we set up a dynamic by which all previous
technologies that are mere extensions of hands and feet and teeth and
bodily heat-controls -- all such extensions of our bodies, including
cities -- will be translated into information systems. Electromagnetic
technology requires utter human docility and quiescence of meditation
such as befits an organism that now wears its brain outside its skull
and its nerves outside its hide. ( McLuhan 1995 , 57) 2

The anthropocentric figure of Narcissus, and Homo sapiens as its own
species body, thus became quiet reflections of an extended organism, an
extended sense of being in which we all wear humankind as our skin .
Skin -- as the outer physical boundary of our bodies and embodied
individuality -- still marks the difference between individuals. New
technologies are generative in relation to the media they are embedded
in, but this generative vitality is an outcome of our embodied human
experience that has a profound capacity to reach out, extend, and
redistribute our sensing capacities through information systems, even
though the body itself might be physically delimited by the skin (
Bateson 1972 ). At the same time, skin serves as the boundary site for
inscribing in our bodies new attributes, capacities, and dreams of the
whole of mankind, mediated through global information networks. Skin
works as the physical human--world interface between the individual and
mankind, body and information, function and intention, now newly
articulated in relation to an 'extended nervous system' at global scale,
as McLuhan saw it -- the Internet.

McLuhan's proposition as to how media and their constant transformation
beyond known formats and circuits -- text to film to electric lighting
-- concentrated on rethinking what we should consider to be
'information' and how bodies will be capable of carrying, communicating,
or transmitting any of that. [With the **biomolecular
revolution**]{.underline} ( Kay 2000 ), [the **cybernetic movement**
of]{.underline} '**[in-formation]{.underline}**' during the important
decades of the mid-twentieth century ( Hayles 1999 ), [and the idea that
DNA is information contained in the medium of bodies]{.underline} --
code of life to be not only decoded but also encoded and now recoded (
Thacker 2010 ) -- [our bodies have become **transformed**
into]{.underline} several distinct media formats that together Eugene
Thacker calls '**[biomedia]{.underline}**'. For him,

biomedia is [a **constant**]{.underline}, consistent, and methodical
[**inquiry** into the]{.underline} technicalphilosophical [question
of]{.underline} '**[what a body can do]{.underline}**' \[. . .\]
**[particular mediations]{.underline}** of the body, [**optimizations**
of the biological in which]{.underline} '[technology]{.underline}'
[appears to **disappear altogether**]{.underline} \[. . .\]. The
apparent paradox of biomedia is that it proceeds via a dual investment
in biological materiality, as well as the informatic capacity to enhance
biological materiality . (ibid., 52--53; italics in original)

The enhancement of biological materiality is, on one hand, driven by
primary and practical goals of healing that are rooted deeply in the
core of the anthropos itself. This also renders new information about
the body valuable, both as direct interventions with the body and
indirectly in the practises by which the body can be healed,
re-balanced, or enhanced. At the same time, [the question]{.underline}
of the 'body' and what it can do [becomes newly articulated and
pertinent to a **vast array of industries**]{.underline}, institutions
related to the generation, processing, and application of the new
biomedia. Here, the question is at once pragmatic and philosophical, and
[value becomes **recast** in terms of **economic** and
**experiment-oriented idioms**]{.underline}.

### Link---Cyber---Generic

#### Cybersecurity policy is a testing ground for the instantiation of a new regime of cybernetic control. You should understand the 1AC not simply as a discrete speech act but "as an active sociotechnical construction site of an emerging digital society."

Once imagined as a "virtual commons", through the rise of Big Data
(Cukier and Mayer-Schönberger 2013), [cyberspace has **increasingly
grown** into a medium of **control**]{.underline} (Cheney-Lippold 2011)
[and a site of **expropriation** and **accumulation** though
**dispossession**]{.underline} (Thacker et al. 2016), [as well as a
space of potential **instability**]{.underline},
**[disorder]{.underline}**, [and **disobedience**]{.underline}. [Its
**paramount importance** for growth and competitiveness]{.underline} in
an ever-growing innovation economy based on digital platform
technologies [has further propelled the perceived need for]{.underline}
"**[securitizing]{.underline}**" [cyberspace]{.underline}, i.e.,
[rendering the digital sphere]{.underline} "[**safe** and
**secure**]{.underline}" [to bring about a desirable
future]{.underline}. How can we make sense of the emerging regimes of
DS&S for a broader critical understanding of contemporary societies?

Cybersecurity as "globalizing" form of security

Around the time when the OECD (2012) observed a new generation of
cybersecurity policies emerging worldwide, **[NATO reflected on the
topicality of cybersecurity]{.underline}** ten years after the 9/11
attacks.

Together with the Twin Towers, our traditional perceptions of threats
collapsed. \[...\] Before 9/11, cyberspace risks and security challenges
were only discussed within small groups of technical experts. But, from
that day it became evident that [the cyber world entails **serious
vulnerabilities** for increasingly interdependent societies]{.underline}
(Theiler 2011, n.p.).

As this quote illustrates, [cybersecurity has become **closely
articulated** within a broader shift in security in a new constellation
of globalized threats]{.underline} in the aftermath of the 9/11
terrorist attacks. In this narrative, sources of insecurity have
virtually globalized. [This articulation of cyberspace]{.underline}
within an emerging landscape of generalized (in-)security and terrorism
not only frames cyberspace as a new field of security interventions but
also [calls for]{.underline} a novel rationality of security and,
correspondingly, [a **novel epistemology** of threat]{.underline}, [a
**revised toolbox** of countermeasures]{.underline}, [and **adaption**
of bureaucratic institutions]{.underline} (Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009,
Simon and de Goede 2015).

In the wake of 9/11, political philosopher Giorgio Agamben has pointed
to the virtual end of a state of security understood in the framework of
national sovereignty and suggested that now "security finds its end in
globalization". Security, he argues, has gradually become the basic
principle of state activity: "What used to be one among several
definitive measures of public administration until the first half of the
twentieth century, now becomes the sole criterium of political
legitimation" (Agamben 2001, n.p.). [This state of security operates on
a **permanent expectation of emergency**]{.underline}: [of risks to be
controlled and threats to be preempted]{.underline} (Cooper 2006). [This
predicament further implies]{.underline}, as critical security scholars
have shown (Buzan et al. 1998; C.A.S.E. Collective 2006), not only a
drastic de-politicization and a de-democratization but, furthermore, [a
**collapse of politics altogether**]{.underline}---[both]{.underline} in
the sense of [**international geopolitics** and]{.underline} in the
sense of **[democratic public policy]{.underline}**. In this new
security logic, [politics collapses into **management**]{.underline},
[and inter-national military conflicts collapse into **police actions**
rationalized in terms of a looming Weltinnenpolitik]{.underline}
(Dauderstädt 2003).

Tying into these reshaped security discourses,
[cybersecurity]{.underline} hence [presents a **seemingly
all-encompassing concern**]{.underline}, [as it articulates issues of
national security]{.underline} and sovereignty [with concerns for
personal safety and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} social and economic
[welfare of]{.underline} contemporary [society]{.underline}
(Cheyney-Lippold 2011; Thacker et al. 2016).

The Austrian experience with the (re-)imagination and conceptualization
of digital safety and security regimes exemplifies how [cybersecurity
does not merely present a **discrete agenda** within]{.underline}
security [policy but]{.underline} rather [amounts to a]{.underline}
"**[globalizing]{.underline}**" [form of security
animating]{.underline}, [and animated by]{.underline}, [an **emerging
sociotechnical regime** of control]{.underline}. [To secure present
societies against digital threats and to achieve a prosperous digital
future]{.underline}, [**huge efforts** are taken that articulate through
**almost all domains** and **levels** of society]{.underline}. As such,
[cybersecurity presents a **testing ground** where the relationships
between an ever-emerging digitalizing society and their corresponding
conceptions of security are **problematized** and
**reordered**]{.underline}. From this, the following propositions
follow:

[The digital society is **co-produced** with cybersecurity]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity must be understood as an **active sociotechnical
construction site** of an emerging digital society]{.underline}. From
this perspective, problematizations of cybersecurity do not merely
emerge in reaction to progressing digital society but rather constitutes
a medium in which the latter is collectively (re-)imagined, publicly
pursued, and institutionally configured. [The aspiration to create a
culture of cybersecurity]{.underline}, hence, further indicates this
generative and productive dimension of DS&S: The aspiration to train and
educate individuals as circumspect users of digital technologies [does
not only seek to protect citizens against harm but simultaneously to
**forge prudent digital subjects**]{.underline}---citizens with the
necessary set of skills and capacities to capture and innovate a digital
society imagined to be caught in constant "in-formation" processes.

Furthermore, [as an **active site** of societal
transformation]{.underline}, [the **seemingly technical** nature
of]{.underline} producing DS&S (in terms of **[innovating new cyber tech
devices]{.underline}**, **[governance instruments]{.underline}**, [and
**digital subjects**]{.underline}) [appears as a **highly political
endeavor**]{.underline}. [To (re-)produce sovereignty in the cyberspace
domain]{.underline}, [a **plethora** of control mechanisms have to be
put in place and kept in operation]{.underline}: [data sets are
**analyzed**]{.underline}, [algorithms **redefined**]{.underline},
[incidents **mapped** and **reported**]{.underline}, [and devices
**redesigned** and **developed**]{.underline}. On the other hand, these
control mechanisms operating at the level of protocol (Galloway 2004)
are complemented by technologies of subjectification (Foucault 2004):
digitally prudent and responsible subjects are forged, ones that acquire
and embody appropriate behaviors, coping strategies, and practices of
self-formation as digital citizens and/or digital experts.

### Link---Cyber---Regulation

#### The aff is a [pipe dream]{.underline} that provides a [cover]{.underline} for cybernetic militarism and makes [nuclear annihilation]{.underline} more likely. Only the alt has a hope of preventing cyberwar.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko, 19**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, "What Is to Be Done?," *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital
Subterfuge in Global Capitalism*, Chapter 3, 151-156, dml)

As we have argued, from 1945 on, [the hegemonic status of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, as
the world's chief capitalist power, [was **intrinsically related** to
the development of]{.underline} computers and networks. The role of
[digital systems]{.underline} in its military--industrial complex,
initially tightly coupled with nuclear weapons, spread through other
aspects of its war-making system as well as through the general economy.
In both aspects, it contributed to the United States's eventual Cold War
victory. In the aftermath of that victory, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continued to
develop]{.underline} its digital military capacities into the ever more
direct weaponization of network, creating [the **technological human
assemblages** of]{.underline} what is today referred to as
**[cyberwar]{.underline}**. The scope of NSA global surveillance and
sabotage programs and the sophistication of the Stuxnet nuclear
centrifuge-destroying malware are only the most manifest instances of
[this process]{.underline}, which [is]{.underline} today [an **integral
part** of a wider upgrade of U.S. military capacities that ties together
a **nuclear primacy** with the **militarization of space** and **drone
warfare**]{.underline}. [Accompanying and spurring on this process is
the]{.underline} additional [dynamic of cyberwar adoption by the forces
**antagonistic** to]{.underline} the global dominance of
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its **allies**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} antagonists
[include]{.underline} the defeated socialist powers, [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}, now paradoxically resurrected as capitalist
competitors in the world market, or, in the case of **[North
Korea]{.underline}**, surviving in a macabre afterlife of state
socialism. They also include the forces of **[militant Islamic
jihadism]{.underline}**, beckoned into existence by the West as an
anticommunist ally, only to become its opponent in the long war on
terror. [All these actors **converge** on the militarization of digital
networks]{.underline}. Many observers today see a moment that
recapitulates the decline of previous imperial hegemons within the
global capitalist system---Spain, Holland, Britain---and parallels the
moments of extreme instability as old powers and new contenders confront
each other.7 [The rise of cyberwar is]{.underline} part of this tumult
and quite possibly [a precursor and preparation for **widening** and
**intensifying conflict**]{.underline}. Schematically, [we can
envisage]{.underline} three potentially intertwining trajectories such a
process might take:

1\. Network degradation. Alexander Klimburg (2017) outlines the
possibility of a "darkening web" characterized by [**persistent** and
**gradually intensifying** cyberwar between states and between states
and terrorist movements conducted in a **variety of
registers**]{.underline}. [Security breaches]{.underline}, [aggressive
malware]{.underline}, [and botnet attacks **proliferate**]{.underline}.
[Digital industrial sabotage and critical infrastructure attacks begin
to **multiply**]{.underline}, [as do the **accidental runaway effects**
of cyberweapons]{.underline}. Networks are deeply and chronically
infected with computational propaganda, fake news, and viral mis- and
disinformation. [In response to adversarial incursions]{.underline},
[states intensify **algorithmic surveillance**]{.underline},
**[censorship]{.underline}**, [and **preemptive virtual
policing**]{.underline}. [Cybersecurity provisions become **increasingly
mandatory** and **elaborate**]{.underline}. [Attribution
problems]{.underline}, [falsification]{.underline} of evidence,
[and]{.underline} the [overlap]{.underline} between military and
intelligence forces and criminal networks [create a **chaotic digital
twilight**]{.underline} of hacking and trolling, botnets and viruses,
malware, surveillance, and bugs, shutdowns, blocking, and filtering, [in
which uncertainties **exacerbate** suspicions and
hostilities]{.underline}, altogether making the internet increasingly
impossible to use. In short, the "darkening web" is what already exists
now, only more so. One of the cofounders of Twitter, Evan Williams,
offered his diagnosis, suggesting that "the Internet is broken"
(Streitfeld 2017). But maybe it's not. Maybe the internet is finally
what it was always meant to be. Maybe it is perfect, but not for us, the
excommunicated user-subjects. For cyberwar.

2\. Hybrid escalations. Similarly rooted in the present is the
likelihood that the [simultaneous virtual and kinetic
conflicts]{.underline}, such as the Syrian civil war, the fighting in
Donbas, and the many branches of the war on terror, [continue and break
out in new regions]{.underline}, [bringing **ever higher levels** and
**varieties** of cyberweapons]{.underline}, deployed for purposes
ranging from intelligence gathering, battlefield surveillance, and
munitions delivery to sabotage of enemies' domestic and military
resources. The use of drones and other semi- or fully automated weapons
systems expands and takes new directions, such as the development of
swarms of small autonomous vehicles---"slaughterbots" (Economist
2017a)---for house-to-house fighting in ruined cities. The biometric and
networked tracking of refugees created by such conflicts, and the
control and interdiction of their entry to affluent fortressed
homelands, becomes a major activity of the nation-state security
apparatus. Because present hybrid wars are also in large part proxy
wars, where local battlefield actors are directly or indirectly
supported by major powers, they are charged with the possibility of
abrupt collisions between the most powerful militaries on the planet.

3\. "Thermonuclear cyberwar." We borrow this phrase from Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay (2017), who are among several authors currently pointing
to a renewed and dangerous rendezvous between cyber- and nuclear
weaponry. The last decade of debates between defense intellectuals about
cyberwar has split those who see digital attacks a new equivalent of
nuclear weapons, capable of disabling whole societies through critical
infrastructure attacks, and skeptics who deride such anxieties as
hyperbolic and implausible. But "**[cyber]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[nuke]{.underline}**" [are **not
separate**]{.underline}. As we have seen, [they were twinned at the
moment of conception]{.underline}, with the development of each
dependent on the other. And [the connection is not just
historical]{.underline}; [it is **current**]{.underline}. Now [cyberwar
weaponry is part of a new approach to nuclear war fighting]{.underline},
the left-of-launch approach. Early ventures in antiballistic missile
defense, such as Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative,
depended on shooting down swarms of missiles as they plunged through the
atmosphere toward their target. Left of launch, in contrast, aims to
"strike an enemy missile before liftoff or during the first seconds of
flight," using "cyber strikes, electronic warfare and other exotic forms
of sabotage" (Broad and Sanger 2017). This doctrine was incubated during
the Obama administration and inherited by the Trump presidency.
Advocates of the left-of-launch nuclear strategy present it as a
defensive measure. However, [the doctrine **destabilizes basic
premises** of deterrence that have]{.underline}, since 1945,
[**restrained** nuclear weapon use]{.underline} (Cimbala 2017).
Deterrence depends on a dread faith by all parties that both their own
and their enemies' nuclear weapons will work. [The possibility
that]{.underline} nuclear weapons [systems might be secretly disabled
raises prospects both of **overconfidence**]{.underline} (trusting one
can sabotage an opponent's system) [or **panicked
preemption**]{.underline} (fearing left-of-launch attacks on one's own
nukes and falling into a "use 'em or lose 'em" mind-set). More
generally, [control and command of nuclear weapons depend on
communication systems whose collapse in a crisis situation could have
**catastrophic results**]{.underline}.8 The origin of the internet lay
in the U.S. attempt to ensure continuance of such systems in the event
of nuclear war; now [the weaponization of the internet]{.underline}
itself [constitutes a possible cause of **nuclear war**]{.underline}.

Facing such prospects, [liberal commentators propose **diplomatic
measures** to control and mitigate cyberhostilities]{.underline}.
Klimburg (2017), for example, suggests a series of initiatives to be
undertaken primarily by the United Nations and the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the long-standing (and
controversy-ridden) forum for internet governance. In these venues, he
suggests, it should be possible to work out a series of
agreements---"[digital arms]{.underline}" **[limitation
treaties]{.underline}**, comparable to those on nuclear weapons;
[an]{.underline} "[attribution and adjudication]{.underline}"
[**council** to assess and arbitrate responsibility]{.underline} for
cyberattacks; [**international cooperation** against
cybercrime]{.underline}; the [promotion]{.underline} within ICANN
[of]{.underline} "**[civil society]{.underline}**"
[perspectives]{.underline} to counter those of states and corporations.
He suggests that "standing bodies" regulating cyberwar would be
comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and
emphasizes the importance of "scientific and authoritative advice from
experts to political decision makers on how to avoid disaster" (344).

[Such proposals]{.underline}, seemingly eminently sensible, [**ignore**
the reality that the tensions driving the rise of cyberwar are also
**incapacitating** the fragile apparatuses and institutions of
international cooperation]{.underline} that have existed since 1945. As
Jon Lindsay (2012) observes, while proposals for [cyberwarfare
treaties]{.underline} are "well meaning," they [would]{.underline},
[within the current state of international great power
relations]{.underline}, [be]{.underline} "**[hacked to
bits]{.underline}**," [because]{.underline}
"[cyberoperations]{.underline}, like other types of intelligence and
covert operations, [take place in the **shadows**]{.underline}. [An
international treaty on cyberweapons would be]{.underline} . . .
**[totally unenforceable]{.underline}**, [since such activity is
designed to **evade** detection and attribution]{.underline}." The
conjuncture in which cyberwar rises, and part of the reason for its
ascent, is the breakdown of nuclear arms limitation and nonproliferation
treaties. Klimburg's comparison of the regulation of cyberwar and
climate change is unfortunately all too telling, given the failure of
global capitalism to generate any binding interstate agreements on
carbon emissions and the recent withdrawal of the United States from
even the nonbinding Paris accord on global warming. And like slowing
climate change, reducing the risk of cyberwar requires deep, systemic
social change.

The argument of this book is that cyberwar is a manifestation of the
competitive nature of capitalism, which, beneath the surface of
globalization, fosters a war of all against all, conducted in the
accelerated, automated, and abstracted forms on which this entire mode
of production now depends. It follows from this that [the prospects for
reducing the dangers of cyberwar]{.underline}, and of the other types of
war of which it is now part, [**depend strongly** on movements and
struggles to **constrain** and]{.underline}, ultimately, [**abolish**
this internally antagonistic order]{.underline}. A recognition of the
extreme difficulty of this project is inherent in the point on which we
opened this chapter, namely, Noys's observation that [the]{.underline}
military high-technology "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**" [of
society has been]{.underline} a factor in **[decomposing]{.underline}**
the traditional industrial working-class [movements]{.underline} that
were historically the main agencies of socialist and communist projects.
[However]{.underline}, [there is also a possible **reversal** of this
logic]{.underline}, [if averting]{.underline} war, including
[cyberwar]{.underline}, [becomes]{.underline} entwined with other
issues, such as struggles for social equality and ecological
sustainability, [a **focal point** for recomposition of movements
looking beyond capital]{.underline}, drawing on new and diverse
constituencies. We have indicated some of the issues that we think might
be drawn together around resistance to the rise of cyberwar:
antisurveillance sentiment, rejection of the secrecy of the security
state and its new digital complexes, concern over the corruption of the
general intellect by mis- and disinformation, objection to corporate and
military criminality, and, of course, revulsion at the exterminatory
horrors of war, from the terror of dirty wars to global thermonuclear
catastrophe.

### Link---Environment/Warming

#### Mobilizing NATO against environmental catastrophe [datafies the planet]{.underline} in an effort to [immunize]{.underline} humanity against the consequences of the cybernetic episteme.

**Caygill, 19**---professor of modern European philosophy at Kingston
University (Daniel, "Anthropokenosis and the Emerging World of War,"
*War and Algorithm*, Chapter 3, 57-59, dml)

Maybe there is too much innocence attending the idea of
catastrophe---this term we use for organizing historical and geological
time and our subjective experience of it. Walter Benjamin would surely
savor the irony of the term he proposed as an alternative to the
principle of "progress" that dominated the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries becoming its substitute in the late twentieth and
early twenty-first centuries. Its emergence is inseparable from the
historic capture of immense energy in nuclear research and
technology---military and civil---that for Jean-Luc Nancy provides a
standard for the equivalence of catastrophe: "The 'equivalence' of
catastrophes here means to assert that the spread or proliferation of
repercussions from every kind of disaster hereafter will bear the mark
of the paradigm represented by nuclear risk."12 [The human access to
**immense sources of energy** lends catastrophe a **planetary**
dimension from which not even the **future** is immune]{.underline};
[the effects of a **nuclear catastrophe**]{.underline} "[spread through
**generations**]{.underline}, [through the **layers** of the
earth]{.underline}: [these effects have an impact on **all living
things** and on the **large-scale organization** of energy
production]{.underline}, hence on consumption as well."13 However,
Jean-Luc Nancy's use of the term "nuclear risk" situates his thought
within [a paradigm of **risk** and **accident**]{.underline} that
[orients catastrophe according to the modality of
**possibility**]{.underline}---[it **might** happen]{.underline}; [it
might **not**]{.underline}---[with the corollary that it is **in
principle survivable**]{.underline}. The notion that a sudden global
nuclear energy surge---civil or military, inadvertent or
intended---might unleash a planetary catastrophe remains for Nancy at
worst a risk or an avoidable possibility rather than an event already
irreversibly engaged.

The political uses of catastrophe or "climate terror" have been explored
by Sanjay Chaturvedi and Timothy Doyle in their Climate Terror: A
Critical Geography of Climate Change. 14 Their two main claims provide
an interesting complement to Steuer's prolegomena. The first is that
climate change, "far from being a moment of rupture or radical
departure, is a continuum marked by an ever-shifting triad of statecraft
and its political economies, nature and power,"15 and the second is that
"climate change geopolitical discourse" is "about controlling the
contestation arising out of longstanding resistance against
environmental degradation in many parts of the global south."16 In spite
of making fascinating observations on the use of catastrophist military
concepts such as WMD and MAD, Chaturvedi and Doyle nevertheless offer a
largely civil account of domination and resistance, not explicitly
articulating "statecraft" and "power" with military violence. Steuer's
focus on new modes of military violence offers a valuable supplement to
Chaturvedi and Doyle but one that continues to subscribe to a
theoretical commitment to catastrophe avoidance or survival through risk
management and ideology critique.

[Perhaps more attention needs to be paid to the **historic matrix** for
our current thinking of catastrophe]{.underline}, [along with its
**limits** and **effects**]{.underline}, in the Cold War strategic
planning that contemplated initiating and surviving military and
environmental catastrophe. In the conception of catastrophe that emerged
in U.S. strategic discussions of the 1950s and early 1960s, the [risk or
possibility of]{.underline} nuclear [catastrophe was **secondary** to
the importance of **surviving** it]{.underline}. [A **major element** in
the proposition that catastrophe was survivable was the **immunizing**
of civil populations against its threat]{.underline}; the strategic
assumption that catastrophe was in principle survivable became a
cultural and political fact that both encouraged the dissemination of
the idea of catastrophe while immunizing us against its horror through
the conviction that it was survivable. [The **dangerous legacy** of this
paradigm is evident in the **sluggish response** of state and
international actors to the threat posed by **systemic planetary
instability** to the **survival of human life** on this
planet]{.underline}.

Most genealogies of geological catastrophe begin in eighteenth- and
earlynineteenth-century debates between catastrophic and continuist
approaches to the fossil and stratigraphic records---such as Charles
Lyell's arguments against Georges Cuvier in the early nineteenth
century. However, it is important not to underestimate the importance of
the more recent and uncanny mobilization of the idea of survivable
catastrophe as an organizing principle of the strategic doctrine of
total war during the Cold War. What Eisenhower criticized as the
"military-industrial complex," or the immense investment in military
research and development central to U.S. strategy in the Cold War, was
organized not only around the concept of catastrophe---especially how to
inflict it upon adversaries---but also around how to survive
catastrophe. It was not just confined to the closed doors and secret
meetings of strategic debate but became a cultural fact whose legacy
continues, even in ways that seem remote from its military sources.

Jacob Hamblin has traced some aspects of this genealogy in his
challenging Arming Mother Nature: The Birth of Catastrophic
Environmentalism. Hamblin makes a powerful contribution to an emergent
counter-history of the environmentalist movement by tracing the notion
of environmental catastrophe to the strategic planning for environmental
war. He shows that the discourses of world war and environmental
catastrophe are closely related: "[The language of]{.underline} the Cold
War's [**global crisis** and]{.underline} that of **[environmental
crisis]{.underline}** are strikingly similar. That left room for
alternative views that postwar affluence, dissatisfaction with pollution
and a new understanding of environmental hazards were the most important
factors."17 In the emergent counter-history of environmentalism, the
global theater of the Cold War and the destructive effects of nuclear
weapons, along with civil/military initiatives dedicated to survival,
[led to the elaboration of a **planetary consciousness**]{.underline}
but one [**firmly rooted** in a strategy of survivable
catastrophe]{.underline}.

Hamblin examines a wide range of military discussions dedicated to
combining atomic bombs with natural forces, to extending the
possibilities of biological warfare, to gathering information and data
about the coming planetary battlefield, and to achieving the satellite
mapping of the planet. With respect to the last initiative, his analysis
of [the drive to gather **planetary data**]{.underline} during the
International Geophysical Year in 1957 offers invaluable background to
the circumstances that subsequently [led]{.underline} not only to the
measurement of global carbon dioxide levels but also [to **NATO's
discussions of environmental**]{.underline}/ecological warfare in the
early 1960s Von Kármán Committee. He shows how
**[catastrophe]{.underline}**, [both how to **inflict** and how to
**survive** it]{.underline}, is at the center of all these discussions:
"[Environmental cataclysms could become **part of the alliance's
arsenal**]{.underline}, with the help of a well-placed nuclear
explosion."18 Hamblin shows how this strategic attention to
environmental war passed over---often through the same scientists---into
a civil environmental critique of planetary degradation and became part
of the intellectual legacy of strategic environmental warfare. [The
**measurements** and **data** collected under the aegis of a **willed
global conflict** between human adversaries using the weapon of
**artificially stimulated environmental catastrophe**]{.underline}19
[came to serve the emergent idea of an **unintended global environmental
catastrophe**]{.underline}---[induced by **human actions**]{.underline},
[suffered by the **planet**]{.underline}, [but also in principle
**survivable**]{.underline}. [The **data collection**]{.underline}, [the
**programs** for processing it]{.underline}, [and the **interpretative
protocols** for making sense of it all emerged from this matrix of
**survivable catastrophe**]{.underline}.

Hamblin's account of the role of survivable catastrophe in environmental
discourse may be supplemented with two further examples, one from the
RAND Corporation20---the research and development think tank associated
with the U.S. Air Force and dedicated, at the height of the Cold War, to
theorizing nuclear deterrence and first-strike capability---and the
other from NASA's earth systems theory, which became the condition of
possibility for conceptualizing the Anthropocene. Both cases offer
examples of survivable [catastrophist discourses]{.underline} at work
and give a sense of how **[deeply]{.underline}** they [**inform**
contemporary attitudes toward the future]{.underline}, [especially the
**blithe inaction** in the face of acknowledged
catastrophe]{.underline}.

### Link---EU

#### Intervening in EU governance mechanisms to secure future technology [furthers]{.underline} the cybernetic takeover of Europe.

**Calcara, et al, 20**---Postdoctoral researcher at the LUISS Guido
Carli University and Adjunct Professor at the Vesalius College in
Brussels (Antonio, with Raluca Csernatoni and Chantal Lavallée,
"Emerging security technologies -- an uncharted field for the EU,"
*Emerging Security Technologies and EU Governance: Actors, Practices and
Processes*, Introduction, 12-15, dml)

The concept of governance has been extensively used to shed light on [EU
policy formulation and implementation]{.underline}. In the late 1980s,
the 'governance turn' in European Studies coincided with and was
stimulated by a significant increase in European competencies in the
wake of the Single European Act and the single market programme
(Kohler-Koch and Rittberger 2006: 32). Studies focus on the simultaneous
centralisation of authority in a continental polity and decentralisation
to subnational regions. They have been shaped by the EU's hybrid
features, which [are]{.underline} hard to categorise with the standard
toolkit of Political Science. Specifically, the EU appears to break the
mould of state-like features, being not a state in itself. Overall, EU
governance studies (Piattoni 2010) argue to move beyond European
mainstream approaches that understood EU integration either as a natural
spillover process (Haas 1958) or as [**driven** by]{.underline} member
states' national interests and actions (Moravcsik 1998), in order to
analyse how the EU works as a decision-making system. In this regard, a
plethora of analyses have come to see the EU as a multilevel governance
(MLG) system, characterised by '[the simultaneous activation of
**governmental** and **non-governmental** actors at various jurisdiction
levels]{.underline}' (Piattoni 2010). MLG studies posit that
decision-making authority is not monopolised by national governments but
is diffused to different levels of decision-making -- the sub-national,
national and supranational levels (Hooghe and Marks 2001: 4). A lively
debate has also emerged on new modes of governance, roughly defined as
non-hierarchical means of political steering, a central characteristic
of EU constrained authority vis-à-vis the member states (Sabel and
Zeitlin 2010).

The literature on EU governance has predominantly dealt with former
firstpillar issues (policy areas in which the EU has exclusive
competence). However, with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, which
abolished the pillar structure, some scholars have explored the
governance of the EU Common Foreign, Security and Defence policy (Webber
et al. 2004; Kirchner 2006). The security governance research has been
especially interested in the EU peculiar role as a security actor. In
this regard, some scholars have argued that the EU can be defined as a
civilian, normative, structural and global power (Manners 2002; Del
Sarto 2016). Scholars have also analysed the social conditions of the
EU's international identity as defined through practices, discourses,
struggles of the actors enacting the EU external relations (Rogers 2009;
Mérand and Rayroux 2016). Moreover, a strand of [research has
highlighted **more complex governance structures** in the EU
security]{.underline} and defence [field than that implied by the
traditional intergovernmental cooperation among national
governments]{.underline}. Some identified the governance in the European
security and defence field as characterised by 'intensive
transgovernmentalism' to indicate that the intensity of interactions and
the density of structured and productive collaboration create
transgovernmental relations that differ from the typical rational
bargaining of intergovernmentalism (Howorth 2001; Wallace and Wallace
2007; Mérand 2008).

According to Cross (2011), [transnational interactions in Europe have
been conductive to the establishment of **influential knowledge-based
networks** of state and non-state actors that]{.underline}, [by sharing
technical]{.underline} and specific professional behavioural
[rules]{.underline}, [have the capacity to]{.underline} shape the
mission of their [organisations **beyond** the original formal
mandate]{.underline}. Other scholars have examined the development of
the EU's security architecture and capacity building, underlying the
role of EU institutions (agencies and expert groups), bureaucracies at
national and European levels, and non-state actors as part of 'epistemic
communities' (Trondal 2008; Cross 2011; Gornitzka and Holst 2015).
Nevertheless, [emphasis has been given to **expert knowledge
production** and its **epistemic influence** in
policy-making]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} '**[epistemic
communities]{.underline}**' [are often]{.underline} considered as
**[homogenous]{.underline}** and consensual **[sidelining]{.underline}**
technical, economic and political [diverging interests in **debates**
surrounding the governance of emerging technologies]{.underline}.

The academic literature on European security has not provided, so far, a
systematic assessment of the main actors involved in the governance of
emerging security technologies. First, European governments maintain a
primary role in the development of these strategic technologies. To make
only a striking example, the French government has developed its own AI
strategy and has affirmed the strategic nature of these technologies for
state security (Villani 2018). Second, European civil and military
industries have an obvious economic interest especially as dual-use
technologies are a simultaneously source of opportunity. However, if the
equipment is unrestricted from military arms control or procurement
policies it is subjected to EU dual-use control (see Vila Seoane,
Chapter 5 in this book). Moreover, in contrast with other regional
contexts, most European military companies have also a predominantly
civilian component (Airbus is a case in point). The development of
dual-use security technologies, therefore, questions the main features
of both the European civil and military markets. This is actually a
long-running debate in the European security field. Already in 1989,
Walker and Gummett noted that:

European defence industries are caught up in the powerful dynamics
surrounding the Single European Act, not least because most defence
contractors are substantial players in civil high-technology markets and
because boundaries between civil and military technology are becoming
harder to draw. Although different that regulatory structures of the two
sectors cannot therefore be kept completely separate -- which means that
there is a potential serious clash of interests between the authorities
concerned with civil and with military industrial activities. (Walker
and Gummett 1989: 420)

[The governance of emerging security technologies is further complicated
by the distinctive policy-making at the European level]{.underline}. [EU
institutions have **increasingly promoted** the development and
employment of]{.underline} 'new', 'dual-use', 'advanced', 'next
generation' or '**[emerging]{.underline}**' [technologies for
**countering**]{.underline} their internal and external **[security
threats]{.underline}**. This is quite evident with regard to the
policies and measures that have been adopted to foster the security
domain of the EU Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. For instance,
[the pursuit of]{.underline} '**[new technologies]{.underline}**' [for
security purposes took on **new dynamics**]{.underline} following the
adoption of 'The Hague Programme: Strengthening Freedom, Security and
Justice in the European Union' (Council 2005). Moreover, security
technologies, as indicated in the EU official documents, need to be
developed through a close collaboration between the public and private
sector, meaning EU public bodies and authorities, academia, research
centres and industries (Bonfanti 2017: 39; Martins and Ahmad, Chapter 3
in this book). Significant budgetary resources have been allocated for
the purpose of researching new security technologies. The EU has also
promoted the involvement of representatives from the military sector in
the definition of R&D, in particular the European Defence Agency (EDA).
This involvement stemmed from the need to synchronise research
initiatives carried out in the civil and military security domains with
a view to avoiding duplications and to promote synergies.

[The EU's institutions]{.underline} such as the European Commission and
the European Parliament, as well as agencies like the EDA, [and the
member states have been **actively involved** in promoting the
development of these technologies]{.underline} (drones and AI, for
instance). [Their common goals have been to **bridge the
technological-innovation gap**]{.underline}, [especially towards
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China**]{.underline}, [to **transform** the European technological and
industrial base into a competitive advantage]{.underline} while also
considering the need of the public acceptance. Hence, [emerging security
technologies are **challenging** the EU's representatives
to]{.underline} find the balance between their promotion by creating
markets and stimulating cutting-edge research and innovation, and the
need to [address their **normative** and **ethical implications** with
legal controls regarding their use and the risks of misuse]{.underline}.

In this regard, the analysis of the [European governance towards these
technologies]{.underline} is also questioning the nature and scope of
the European integration. Such technical advancements are transforming
civil--military practices and [might have **unforeseen long-term
effects** on]{.underline} the **[EU imaginaries]{.underline}** ([what
the EU **is**]{.underline}) [and its **global role**]{.underline}.
Concerning these changes, in the last few years, [we have seen growing
concerns]{.underline} in the critical literature and civil society
[about the **militarisation** of the EU]{.underline}. Some scholars
engaged in the debate on armed drones within the EU (Csernatoni 2018;
Paulussen and Dorsey 2016; Martins 2015), in line with the important
academic debate on the legal, political and ethical issues regarding the
extra-judicial 'drone killings' used by the American administration
under the then President Obama as counter-terrorism measures in
Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan (Schulzke 2017; Barrinha and da
Mota 2016; Hajjar, Levine and Naqvi 2014).

The apprehensions concerning the risks that [the European contribution
to the development of emerging technologies might **transform** the EU's
**scope** and **nature**]{.underline} have further intensified with the
2016 'European Defence Action Plan' and the launch of the European
Defence Fund by the European Commission. For instance, such fears have
been openly expressed through demonstrations at the 2018 EDA's annual
conference on 'From Unmanned to Autonomous Systems: Trends, Challenges
and Opportunities'. In the international context where the 'Campaign to
Stop Killer Robots' gains momentum, some critical voices expressed clear
concerns about the possibility that European companies developing lethal
autonomous weapons might have access to EU funds or criticised the
military interest at national level to possess such weapons, [raising
the probability of a **global arms race**]{.underline} (Teffer 2018a,
2018b). With a new European discourse on civil drones, [some
scholars]{.underline} rather **[criticised]{.underline}** the
**[demilitarisation]{.underline}** of dual-use technologies such as
drones [as a means to **manage** public acceptability by **reducing the
scope of debate**]{.underline} in Europe (Boucher 2015).

### Link---Hybrid War

#### The 1AC's reading of hybrid warfare misses the [informatic transformation]{.underline} of war into a [data-gathering exercise]{.underline}. Legal regulations of warfare are [never]{.underline} epistemically neutral in the cybernetic era.

**Steuer, 19**---research fellow at the Centre for Applied Philosophy,
Politics, and Ethics (CAPPE) at the University of Brighton (Daniel,
"Prolegomena to Any [F]{.underline}uture Attempt at Understanding Our
Emerging World of War," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter 2, 14-16, dml)

According to Kaldor, [the term]{.underline} "**[hybrid
wars]{.underline}**," [or]{.underline} "**[hybrid
threats]{.underline}**," "[nicely captures the **blurring** of public
and private]{.underline}, [state and non-state]{.underline}, [formal and
informal]{.underline}," but [if it is used **exclusively** to refer
to]{.underline} "[a **mixture** of different types of war]{.underline}
(conventional warfare, counter-insurgency, civil war, for example)," [we
risk **failing to notice**]{.underline} "[the **specific logic** of new
wars]{.underline}."34 The [hybridity]{.underline} of the New Wars is not
just a matter of there being such an admixture of old types of war and
fighting; it [results from a blending of categories in **all** of its
elements]{.underline}.35

From the perspective of military and security experts, [hybridity marks
the **shift** from the paradigm of war to that of **policing** and
**security** operations]{.underline}, but it does not challenge the
friend--enemy distinction.36 A hybrid threat is "any adversary that
simultaneously and adaptively employs a fused mix of conventional
weapons, irregular tactics, terrorism, and criminal behaviour."37 Thus,
hybridity is not the medium of all action but a trait of identifiable
moves carried out by identifiable opponents ("challengers" or
"competitors"38). The distinction between legality (or legitimacy) and
illegality (or illegitimacy) is retained. But, as we shall see, [hybrid
threats **require**]{.underline}, [and **breed**]{.underline}, [hybrid
responses]{.underline}.

In Rupert Smith's analysis, [war among the people]{.underline} "[is the
reality in which]{.underline} the people in the streets and houses and
fields---**[all the people]{.underline}**,
**[anywhere]{.underline}**---[are the battlefield]{.underline}. . . .
Civilians are the targets, objectives to be won, as much as an opposing
force."39 [The true aim in using military force is to]{.underline} "[win
the **clash of wills**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} to that end to
"[change or form the **intentions** of the]{.underline} civilian
[population]{.underline}."40 "Individual guerrillas" or "alternative
political leaders" move and fight among "the specific people of
\[their\] interest, whilst the audience of these conflicts has become,
courtesy of the media, the people of the world." This audience
influences political decisions at least as much as do "events on the
ground," and thus the guerrillas or alternative [leaders]{.underline}
"[use the **media** to influence **decisions**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} above all [the **will** of those people they seek to
lead and co-opt]{.underline}. [This is not so much the global
**village** as the global **theatre** of war]{.underline}, [with
**audience participation**]{.underline}."41

[War among the people is a competitive exercise in **social
transformation** and **control**]{.underline}, [a hybrid form of
hegemony]{.underline}, [with the aim of determining the **narration** of
events]{.underline}.42 [The use of force may **help** you to become the
master narrator]{.underline}, [but it cannot achieve that goal by
**itself**]{.underline}.43 The "confrontational battlefield" includes
"economic, diplomatic, political, humanitarian," and other organs of
power,44 and a commander therefore needs military and civilian staff
that are multidisciplinary as well as multinational, in order to gather
the required information in ethnographically foreign contexts.45 The
necessity of joint political and military analysis means that "there are
no longer purely military or political situations," especially as
"**[information]{.underline}**, [not **firepower**]{.underline}, [is the
**currency** upon which]{.underline} it \[**[war]{.underline}** among
the people\] [is run]{.underline}." And just as "information is neither
purely political nor purely military,"46 so [it is]{.underline} "[**no
longer possible** to simply divide activities between military and other
services]{.underline}."47 Thus, "[the question will be **who is
providing security and from what**]{.underline}, **[whose laws and
regulations prevail]{.underline}**, **[and who are the
judges]{.underline}**."48 What kind of expert is required in this
situation?

In 2010, David Kilcullen, a former member of the Australian Army and
advisor to the U.S. military, founded the "research and analysis firm"
Caerus Associates, which "helps clients understand, adapt, and operate
in complex and conflict-affected areas around the globe." Apart from the
United States and allied governments, clients include "financial
institutions, media companies, non-profit and philanthropic
organizations, legal institutions, and technology companies." [Big data
analysis is used]{.underline} "[to **find meaning** in
complexity]{.underline}:" "By working with clients to translate
meaningful behaviors into data---and back again---we support actionable
insight by identifying 'honest signals' in complex, local
environments."49 [This description contains **all the components** of
the **emerging form of war**]{.underline}: [**any part** of the world
may be translated into data]{.underline}, [and action is taken on the
basis of the analysis of these data]{.underline}. [Differences between
military and nonmilitary operations]{.underline}---whether the object is
a "conflict ecosystem" or a complex (business) environment---[are at
**best** a matter of **degree**]{.underline}. The parameters provided by
the "client" determine the desirable outcome.

In his earlier research papers and books, Kilcullen describes a global
theater of war in which "\[f\]orces contributing to effects, but not
physically within theatre" are included as parts "of a Virtual
Theatre."50 As they are for Smith, so for Kilcullen "the people remain
the prize,"51 and by "the people" he means "a global audience rather
than a local citizenry."52 Modern counterinsurgency has to navigate "a
cultural and demographic jungle of population groups," and this
navigation requires data collection combining "open-source research and
'denied area ethnography.'"53 The aim, according to his "theory of
competitive control," is to be "the local armed actor that a given
population perceives as best able to establish a predictable,
consistent, wide spectrum normative system of control," as such an actor
is "most likely to dominate that population and its residential area."54

A government is no more than "a political organization that has
successfully outcompeted its rivals across the full coercion-persuasion
spectrum, allowing it to establish an uncontested normative system over
a given population or territory."55 It follows that any normativity is
secondary to the competition over the capacity to establish it in the
first place.56 The "coercive end of the spectrum is critical" because,
following Max Weber, all other parts "rest on the ultimate sanction of
force."57 [All differences between types of force
**disappear**]{.underline}, [leaving a crisscrossing landscape of
rivaling entities who aim to become the **source of normativity** and
the **security provider**]{.underline}. At that point, [warfare and the
battlefield take the form of a **market** in which hybrid competitors
fight over the **control of populations**]{.underline}, offering
security as their product. [The **people** are the prize]{.underline},
[the **extraction of value** the aim]{.underline}. This situation is the
permanent state of exception: the temporary sovereign is who or whatever
is able to forge the common predicament, the shared objective, the
shared perception of a threat or problem, and so forth, and provide
protection and solutions. The master paradigm is no longer war and peace
but risk and security.58 The sovereign is he who wins the will or
obedience of the people by whatever means.59

**Kendall, 19**---senior lecturer and codirector of the Centre for
Critical International Law at Kent Law School, University of Kent (Sara,
"Law's Ends: On Algorithmic Warfare and Humanitarian Violence," *War and
Algorithm*, Chapter 5, 106-109, dml)

This chapter begins from Noll's philosophical claims about [the
**underlying thinking** that shapes AI]{.underline}, such as the
self-learning algorithms that [comprise]{.underline} it, as well as
their consequences for closing the space of human judgment presumed by
law. Building upon these concerns, I turn to [the **substance**
of]{.underline} the **[l]{.underline}**aw **[o]{.underline}**f
**[a]{.underline}**rmed **[c]{.underline}**onflict [or]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[h]{.underline}**umanitarian
**[l]{.underline}**aw, situating it historically to illustrate that even
if it could grasp the phenomenon, [this law would **replicate** and
**perpetuate** the asymmetries that have accompanied its historical
development]{.underline}. [The humanitarian dimension]{.underline} of
this body of law [is **applied biopolitically**]{.underline}, [securing
particular populations to the **detriment** of others]{.underline}, [as
seen in practice through the **allegedly**]{.underline}
"**[distinctive]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline}
"**[proportionate]{.underline}**" [use of drones]{.underline}.7 Building
upon critical accounts of international humanitarian law's origins and
practices, I address the distinct temporality of these emerging weapons
systems. The logic that shapes algorithmic forms aims to condense time
into intervals beyond the capacity of human response, and [the objective
of LAWS to supplement human cognition **threatens to exceed the laws**
of their own creators]{.underline}.

As a means of condensing time in response to perceived threats,
algorithmic warfare reveals a preemptive rationality. I conclude with a
possible alternative: to recast preemption as an ethico-political
exercise of human judgment. [In their autonomous lethality]{.underline},
[LAWS would **foreclose human judgment** on the
battlefield]{.underline}. As with the U.S. military's "Project Maven,"
considered here, [resisting this foreclosure calls for a **collective
political response** to **interrogate** and **unsettle** the processes
that contribute to the emergence of autonomous weapons]{.underline}. At
the time of writing, [war by algorithm appears as an imagined
future]{.underline}, but one [whose prospect becomes **increasingly
likely** through **incremental technological developments**]{.underline}
in intelligence gathering and analysis [that may not treat autonomy as
their objective]{.underline}. [Enhancing warfare through
algorithms]{.underline} and machine learning [in the name of
**humanitarian ends**]{.underline}---such as more precise targeting,
leading to more proportionate numbers of casualties--- [may in fact
**hasten** the advent of a violence that law is **unable to
contain**]{.underline}.

LAW'S ENDS

Considering "the end of law" as Noll does invites two questions: what do
we mean by "end," and what do we mean by "law"? We might think of law's
end as a kind of closure or termination, when law is incapable of
diminishing or regulating forms of violence. But law's end might also
refer to its telos or objective. Here law's telos may in fact be the
production of a world where its enforcement is no longer necessary. In
the political dream of perfect compliance, law's subjects could police
themselves. Does it then matter whether its subjects are humans or
machines or indistinguishable within a shared cybernetic relation? What
would legal subjectivity look like beyond the human? When subjects
inaugurate their own laws, are they more likely to comply with them? If
autonomy signifies the unity between the law-giving and the law-abiding
subject, then at an extreme of this logic, LAWS may no longer appear as
a threat but rather as a perfect state of self-regulation, as auto
nomos. 8 Questions pile upon questions as we contemplate an imagined
future that can only be addressed speculatively and from the limited
horizon of the present.

The first understanding of law's end foregrounds the limits or failure
of law, whereas the second suggests its ambitions. The [scholarly
literature on LAWS reveals a **deep anxiety** concerning law's capacity
to respond]{.underline} to these weapons: they are harbingers of a
dystopian future that law must adapt to if it is to remain relevant;
more specifically, [they must be brought under]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[h]{.underline}**umanitarian
**[l]{.underline}**aw; [they should be **banned** or **controlled by
treaties**]{.underline}; **[accountability mechanisms]{.underline}** for
LAWS [must be established]{.underline}; [they are **ethically
unacceptable**]{.underline}; [they **must always be governed**
by]{.underline} "**[meaningful human control]{.underline}**." Shared
principles emerge across these different accounts. For example,
[one]{.underline} recent publication [argues for adopting **preventive
security governance frameworks** through international
law]{.underline},9 [another for developing **ethical
guidelines**]{.underline} to ensure the presence of "meaningful human
control."10 Autonomous weapons must not operate as "LAWS unto
themselves" but must instead be subsumed under a law not of their own
making.11 Such approaches illustrate the paradox that Noll points out:
"An autonomous weapons system subjected to the heteronomos of the law
would no longer be an autonomous weapons system at all."12 The ancient
Greek heteros refers to the other of two, and here a difference is
drawn: the nomos of autonomous weapons systems is not the nomos of law,
and in this sense law's end is its failure to subsume algorithmic
warfare under its own categories. Put another way, law offers no
Grundnorm that governs beyond human cognition, as law and AI "appear to
belong to different normative orders," if AI can indeed be brought under
any normative order.13 We seem to have arrived at law's limits.

The second understanding of "law's end," as its telos, is more
open-ended and multiple. To remain with the examples above, where [law
appears as something of a **deus ex machina** brought in to **resolve a
dystopian narrative** drifting beyond human mastery]{.underline}, [its
end is to **constrain** or **contain** or to **regulate**
violence]{.underline}. A particularly provocative illustration is found
in the short film Slaughterbots, widely disseminated on social media,
which ends with a call for a ban treaty.14 [This commonly shared
presumption]{.underline} concerning law's objective or telos
**[undergirds]{.underline}** the **[l]{.underline}**aw
**[o]{.underline}**f **[a]{.underline}**rmed **[c]{.underline}**onflict,
[often]{.underline} tellingly [referred to as]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[h]{.underline}**umanitarian
**[l]{.underline}**aw. The dystopian narrative of LAWS is futural and
speculative, but in this imagined future law's end would be to bring
LAWS under its authority or, put another way, within its (humanitarian)
jurisdiction.

Noll's reading of law's end in this second sense, as objective or telos,
builds upon the distinction between the incarnate and excarnate. In the
monotheistic normative frame supporting the legal order, he contends,
the objective of law is to "incarnate" the external, a-corporeal,
written command, code, or statute---"excarnate" law---through study and
compliance. Incarnating law in this way takes place through human
consciousness, as has been the case from the emergence of monotheism
through secular codified law, including the laws of armed conflict. In
this sense, the end of law as its ambition or
objective---incarnation---also reveals its limits: law cannot be
extended beyond human consciousness. Law's two ends described above---as
either ambition here or as limit above---seem to meet within this
reading, where its imbrication with human consciousness through study
and compliance reveals the outer borders of its jurisdiction. We arrive
at the end of a law unable to achieve its end-as-telos.

The meaning of law at stake in Noll's account excludes what cannot be
subsumed under this structure of incarnation. [Law is understood as
**guiding**]{.underline} (**[human]{.underline}**)
**[behavior]{.underline}**; for example, [in the context of armed
conflict]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} "[a]{.underline} kind of
[call]{.underline} . . . [to **use weapons
responsibly**]{.underline}."15 [Responsibility is tied to **human
cognition**]{.underline} (as with state of mind, knowledge, and intent),
[which is **complicated** by the shared agency of **algorithmic
human-machine assemblages**]{.underline}. If [law]{.underline} is a
call, it [operates]{.underline} rhetorically [as a mode of
**address**]{.underline}, [directed to particular subjects who must be
capable of **responding** to it and]{.underline}, in turn, [of being
**held responsible**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} mode of address
[is **severed** by the logic of **code**]{.underline}, where excarnate
commands are directed outward "and made to act on the world."16 Yet even
as law's call is embodied by the human subject, [there is **no rule**
for the application of rules]{.underline}: [what is required is the
**even more thoroughly human capacity** for judgment and the response to
this call by way of interpretation]{.underline}. The space of human
cognition is arguably a space of judgment, where humans may respond to
law's call of proportionality by affixing ratios of civilian to
combatant deaths and deeming them proportionate.17 There is a lingering
question of whether the law at stake here---the law of armed conflict or
international humanitarian law---can be properly humanitarian in the
first place, protecting the bare human irrespective of politics,
history, and membership within a particular population. Noll illustrates
how LAWS cannot be brought under law, but even if they could be, what
law is this, and what are its ends?

### Link---NATO

#### NATO security cooperation over emerging tech is [inextricable]{.underline} from a history of violent cybernetic colonialism. The aff is a [PSYOPS campaign]{.underline} designed to transform the world into data.

logistical formations,"

Here, [the idea of an]{.underline} '**[information
environment]{.underline}**' [has come to be **central** to strategic
military concerns]{.underline}. Indeed, [for **NATO**]{.underline},
'[information flow is now **so prevalent**]{.underline}, [**potent** and
**unavoidable**]{.underline} ... [it forms as much a part of the
operations environment as the **terrain** or
**weather**]{.underline}.'102 This **[NATO doctrine]{.underline}**
document [elaborates the informational environment as consisting of
**information**]{.underline}, [**technology** and the **minds** that
receive and process it]{.underline} -- [both **echoing** the
**cybernetic understanding** of the human-machine system and
**combining** it with]{.underline} what appears to be insights from
**[behavioural economics]{.underline}**:

[Events in the world are **transmitted as information** through networks
before getting into people's minds]{.underline}; [once
there]{.underline}, [the information is subject to
**pre-conception**]{.underline}, **[interpretation]{.underline}**,
**[bias]{.underline}**, **[agenda]{.underline}**, [**adjustment** and
possibly **retransmission**]{.underline}. This is the information
environment which is defined as: the information itself, organizations
that receive, process and convey the information, and the cognitive
processes that people employ, including the virtual and physical space
in which this occurs. The environment encompasses the full range of
traditional, new and emerging [media technologies]{.underline}, all of
which [provide **new possibilities** for dialogue including delivery of
**PSYOPS messages** and **persuasive content**]{.underline}.103

The mind is viewed here as part of the information environment; or,
rather, [the environment in which military operations are devised and
enacted is **extended** into]{.underline} '**[people's
minds]{.underline}**' [and their]{.underline} '**[cognitive
processes]{.underline}**'. [This **literal world-as-data** is laid out
as the **new battleground**]{.underline}, [the mind consonant with and
merely a **terrain** to be opened up for **military
operations**]{.underline}, [**political messaging** and **consumer
advertising** alike]{.underline}.104

TARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

This 2014 Allied Joint Doctrine for [**NATO** utilises]{.underline} the
concept and method of Target Audience Analysis as developed by the BDi,
and used by SCL and Cambridge Analytica in most, if not all of their
campaigns.105 Steve Tatham defines TAA as

[the ability to **empirically diagnose**]{.underline} the exact
groupings that exist within **[target populations]{.underline}**.
Knowing these groupings allow them to be ranked and the ranking depends
upon the degree of influence they may have in either promoting or
mitigating constructive behaviour. The methodology involves a
comprehensive study of a social group of people. It examines this group
of people across a host of psycho-social research parameters, and it
does so in order [to determine how best to **change that group's
behaviour**]{.underline}. ... TAA is a decision-maker's tool, which will
explain and forecast behaviour -- and make scientifically justifiable
recommendations to implement programmes to change problematic
behaviours. 106

Over the past decade the BDi(and SCL Group) delivered a number of
training programs for NATO, and in Britain, for the Home Office,
Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office. TAA and their patented
'Measure Of Effectiveness' methods are now 'best practice' in NATO and
UK Defence and info/PSYOPS departments and are widely used across
different domains of counterinsurgency. 107 In the 2014 doctrine TAA is
seen as a vital method in the tailoring of strategic communications and
PSYOPS. The doctrine states that

\[u\]nderstanding and empathy are key to PSYOPS; target audience
analysis is the tool by which this is achieved. Effective analysis
should provide a rich contextual understanding of the cultural, historic
and social composition of the target audience, along with a deep
awareness of emotive and credible themes and symbols, all of which can
be used to effect short-term behavioural and long-term attitudinal
change.108

One example of the method in practice is Project DUCO; a sensitive UK
Ministry of Defence trial in a 'hybrid' TAA approach in 2013 that was
run by SCL Group.109 The stated aim of the pilot was 'to assess the
utility of this approach to identify emerging groups, the motivations
behind their formation and their likely behaviours in a given
context'.110 The report states that 'SCL deployed their BDi Country
Sweep methodology to identify key factors affecting instability in
\[redacted\] and the Target Audiences (TA) associated with them. This
approach isolated 25 key TAs as being critical to stability. The TAA
methodology was then deployed to home in on understanding and
intervening on 'Young Unmarried Males' (YUMS), seen as one of the most
critical TAs \[redacted\]'.111 In using this methodology, the authors of
the report cite the behavioural economic theory of "locus of control".
In an exposition of Project Duco in a report for the US Army War
College, Tatham explains that a

\[t\]arget audience's locus of control represents that audience's view
of what determines the course of future events. ... A number of
revelations flow from the finding that a given audience is characterized
by, for example, an external locus of control. ... An audience with an
external locus of control is less inclined to take action, because in
their worldview, doing so will have little influence on how matters will
play out.112

He goes on to state that it is essential to determine the locus of
control in a target population, as it shapes the target messaging and
likelihood of revisions of behaviour. Further, he alludes to '\[a\]
research project of the \[Nigerian\] electorate to establish under what
conditions the public might rise up against the government if fraudulent
practices were observed', which 'actually revealed that there were
almost none -- because their locus of control was particularly low.'113
Here, we should recall that SCL ran the election campaign in Nigeria
2015.114

In chapter 3 we saw the development of numerous social science projects
funded by the US military across Latin America in the 1960's with the
most controversial being Project Camelot. This project and others like
it attempted to create workable models of societies that would predict
and pre-empt civil unrest by incorporating insights from sociology,
anthropology, psychology and systems analysis. I have argued that [these
projects are another form of **extractive**]{.underline} '**[scientific
colonialism]{.underline}**', [where information about a
nation]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} in this case, [a
population]{.underline} or 'target audience') [is extracted from it from
the outside]{.underline} and manufactured into workable knowledge, [and
either exported back or used against it]{.underline}. Again, [these were
**counterinsurgency tactics**]{.underline} -- the [aim being to predict
and prevent insurgent thought and practice]{.underline}. As a doctrine
seeking to model population behaviour, TAA thus resembles the kind of
cybernetic thinking I explored in the first half of the thesis, and is
in many ways its spiritual (and genealogical) successor. TAA reflects
this logistical turn in the modelling, prediction of and attempts to
intervene in and change behaviour. In the first half of this thesis, we
saw cybernetic modelling as an attempt to create a standard, unified
language and hence model of everything that would describe, explain and
thus help predict and modulate futures. I show that [though by
name]{.underline}, [cybernetics dropped out of fashion]{.underline},
[its **methodologies** and **fundamental model** of the world became
**subsumed** into various disciplines as an aspect of logistical
rationality]{.underline}. In TAA and across the persuasive architectures
of the internet more broadly, the turn toward personalisation appears at
first glance to be a move away from the more explicit claim to universal
modelling. As Tatham writes,

There exists no universal communication model applicable to all groups
and cultures. All communication efforts must be tailored to the local
dynamics, and with respect to the behaviours one is seeking to change.
Because audiences are multi-faceted and cannot be grouped as a
population, influencing the different component groups of a society
requires precisely targeted methods and approaches: One message -- no
matter how culturally relevant -- does not fit all. Working out who to
influence, why, how, when, and whether it is possible, constitutes the
first steps of the TAA. Often, it will be necessary to influence one
group in order to influence another.115

That TAA is deemed to be an empirical and 'scientifically verifiable'
method to determine 'exact groupings' within a population, claiming to
be able to both definitively induce and measure behaviour change within
a particular audience or population seems to run counter to this claim.
Though there is an increasing focus on difference, personalisation and
precise targeting, within TAA, StratCom, info/PSYOPS and most
widespread, throughout the commercial marketing sector, [the
**overarching**]{.underline} '**[model]{.underline}**' [is]{.underline}
the same. This is [to **extract** knowledge and experience]{.underline},
[**translate** it into]{.underline} ([**inherently impoverished** and
**exclusionary**]{.underline}) [machine-readable data]{.underline}, [and
to **use** said data to create predictions and modulate
behaviour]{.underline} as outcomes in line with organizational goals.
That TAA is said to be applicable and is deployed [across diverse
situations and toward a multitude of goals]{.underline} -- political,
economic, commercial and military -- is [indicative of the scope and
reach of this]{.underline} particular iteration of **[logistical
rationality]{.underline}**. In fact, TAA can be understood an updated
and more comprehensive iteration of this dream of finding universal
rules of communication and modelling: it works to enfold culture and
identity into this project of universality. Here, [differences can
**universally be mapped**]{.underline}, [and the world can]{.underline}
still [**universally be rendered as data** because the
science]{.underline}, [the models and the algorithms are complex enough
to capture the complexity of the world itself]{.underline}.

DATA EXTRACTION FOR EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY

Finally, I want to look to a project of Steve Tatham that is
demonstrably a culmination of the logics outlined throughout. Tatham was
listed as a senior advisor in Mackay's company 'Complexas', a company
deploying TAA and the various behavioural science and influence
methodologies developed in the BDi and following the principles of
behavioural economics, Public Relations (PR) and strategic
communications, for the explicit purpose of helping to negate resistance
to extractive industries projects in 'frontier markets' in Africa
specifically.116 Tatham's name has since been taken off the website and
his involvement in this company scrubbed from the internet, save for the
Internet Archive. In a supporting co-authored paper by Mackay and
Tatham, they argue for the use of TAA in helping multinational
corporations conduct extractive operations in 'complex and unstable
regions of the world'.117 They begin the paper by recognising that 1.5
billion people live in areas affected by conflict or other forms of
instability; however, that 'these areas are often also rich in
resources', and therefore ways to ameliorate conflict for the purposes
of smoother extractive industries is vital.118 The correlation between a
wealth of natural resources and the causes and legacies of conflict
remains unexplored.119 Here as well we should think back to those
programmes of modernisation and development that favoured infrastructure
heavy, extractive, and export-led development, and the necessarily
violent and extractive architecture of debt they produced as outlined in
chapters two and three.

The paper laments lost profits due to MNCs collective failure to
recognise, mitigate for and assuage local populations before resistance
to projects occur -- using the infamous example of Shell's operations in
the Niger Delta. In a sparse and underdeveloped account of the case, the
authors argue that yes, there were some environmental damages, but
overall, Shell spent too much on security and not enough on the
development of the community, and that this led to unhappiness, hence
resistance, hence a massive profit loss. No mention is made of the
documented fact of Shell's misreporting of the causes of leaks (accusing
the community of sabotage when they have been identified as corrosion),
the massive ecological consequences of the annual 240,000 barrels spilt
in the area, the mounting evidence of neonatal deaths and other health
complications, and not to mention the history of military and security
repression and murders associated with the government and Shell
themselves.120 Instead, the failure of Shell to generate maximal profits
is seen as a lack of understanding of the 'operational environment' --
assuming that security and development (in a very narrow sense of the
word) will equal stability. Here again [we see the need to go
**beyond**]{.underline} Zuboff's [analysis of these processes as
**essentially nonviolent**]{.underline}. [Erasing these **complex
histories of violence**, **expropriation** and]{.underline} the
**[well-documented crimes]{.underline}** of Shell in the Niger Delta,
Tatham and Mackay [create a **blueprint for counterinsurgency** focusing
on how to influence opinion and quell legitimate dissent to damaging
projects]{.underline}. [The erasure of forms of domination]{.underline}
enacted on communities and lands afflicted by large scale extractive
projects [forms the **foundation for further domination** and
**extraction**]{.underline}. [This **epistemic violence**]{.underline},
[apparent in the **circumscription** of **what is deemed worthy of
inclusion** in the **models** upon which the world is
organised]{.underline}, [**actively shapes** the organisation of
violence in future projects]{.underline}, [and further]{.underline},
**[people's futures]{.underline}**.

### Link---Securitization

#### Responding to security threats with predictive imaginaries of technology as humanity's savior invests in a [fantasy of cybernetic resolution]{.underline} that [pumps fuel]{.underline} into the engine of global datafication. Only the alt can solve.

**Robles-Anderson, 21**---associate professor of media, culture, and
communication at New York University (Erica, ""Wave Fronts of
Calculation": A Response to Achille Mbembe," Public Culture (2021) 33 (1
(93)): 35--40, dml)

[We are twenty years into the twenty-first century]{.underline}. **[The
world is flush with]{.underline}** moneys sans **[fiat]{.underline}**.
[Corporations intimately connect to **everyone** yet answer to **no
one**]{.underline}. [Life itself can be **engineered** and
**patented**]{.underline}. **[A]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence **[will solve everything]{.underline}**.
[We live on a swiftly tilting planet heading toward **ecological
collapse**]{.underline}.

In "Futures of Life and Futures of Reason" Achille Mbembe traces a
constellation of megaprocesses brutally depleting the planet\'s
resources while pushing life into ever more extreme conditions for
survival. Now is a nasty, brutish place. How can we live within this
crisis of our making? When finance capitalism turns out to be the shared
global infrastructure, perhaps the best recourse is to forge a new
Leviathan to try and stay the reach of the invisible hand.

But Mbembe\'s essay goes another way. It is an attempt to mobilize
critical imagination. It reckons with the logics of interlocking systems
in order to reanimate our sense of contingency. [In a]{.underline}
"**[society of security]{.underline}**" [**every attempt** will be made
to **foreclose ungoverned possibilities** under the auspices of
containing risk]{.underline}. [Social order will be]{.underline}
"[**dominated** by the irrepressible need for adhesion to]{.underline} a
collection of **[certainties]{.underline}**" (24--25). This
irrepressible need is [operationalized through]{.underline}
borderization and **[computing]{.underline}**, processes which
constitute two sides of the same coin.

When borderization and computing meet in the conditions of surveillance
capitalism and ethnonationalism, then voilà! Only Palantir can "Save the
Shire."1 For those not fluent in Middle Earth, a palantir is a seeing
stone, a magical artifact for viewing at a distance. The Tolkienism is
an aptly chosen name for a data-analytics company that supplies
technology for the US Department of Defense and the US Department of
Homeland Security. The Shire, it turns out, is conveniently located near
Stanford University. Palantir is currently the single-largest occupant
of commercial real estate in Palo Alto, California. With a vantage from
Silicon Valley\'s ivory tower, the backing of venture capitalist and
PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and a recent IPO, a society of security
has a global market to conquer and a world to win.

Mbembe\'s essay places the interlocking capacities of borderization and
computing within a speed regime. Speed has long been analyzed as the
logic and mechanism for bringing economy, technology, war, and psychic
life into common formation. As Paul Virilio (2012: 41) wrote, "Speed now
illuminates reality whereas light once gave objects of the world their
shapes." But here I pause. I am not convinced that a corporate actor
such as Palantir is possible in a speed regime. Indeed, there is
something else, something latent in Mbembe\'s essay, something other
than speed.

Consider the following passage:

[Current myths claim that **technology** constitutes the best tool for
**governing**]{.underline} these arrivals, [that technology **alone**
allows for the **resolution** of this problem]{.underline}---[a problem
of **order**]{.underline}, [but also of **awareness**]{.underline}, of
identifiers, [of **anticipation** and **predictions**]{.underline}. [It
is feared that the dream of a humanity]{.underline} transparent to
herself, **[stripped of mystery]{.underline}**, [might prove to be a
**catastrophic illusion**]{.underline}. For the time being,
[**migrants** and **refugees** are bearing the **brunt** of
it]{.underline}. In the long run, [it is **by no means certain** that
they will be the only ones]{.underline}. (25)

"The resolution of this problem" is a telling double entendre.
Resolution can mean the resolving of a conflict. Resolution can also
refer to the sharpness of an image. To improve resolution is to see in
greater detail, to bring something more sharply into view. Data
technologies promise both of these things. **[If only every problem were
technical rather than political then more data could indeed resolve
every conflict]{.underline}**. [It is the **fantasy of resolution** that
drives **investments**]{.underline}---**[financial]{.underline}**,
**[political]{.underline}**, **[psychic]{.underline}**---[in
**data-extraction techniques** and **surveillance
systems**]{.underline}. [It is also the liberal rationale for
**deferring moral reasoning** and **ethical action**]{.underline}. [We
shall **wait** and we shall **see** and then we shall
**decide**]{.underline}. [But later **never comes** and thus decisions
are **not made**]{.underline}.

Governing how the future arrives is beyond the capacities of a speed
regime. Speed regimes exploit differential relationships to space-time.
Power is action at a distance, aimed at expansion and growth. Resolution
is more akin to saturation, concentration, or finer-grain detail.
Resolution does not necessarily require speed. Resolution reveals layers
upon layers of presence and absence, signal and noise, order and
disorder. Even as I write these words a surveillance plane flies above a
police helicopter, which hovers above a drone, which flies above
street-level surveillance cameras, which watch over mobile phones. It is
faith in resolution that powers politics by the state, politics in the
streets, and politics in online discourse. It is faith in resolution
that powers global visions of a computable Earth. We are moving from a
speed regime toward a smart regime.

In the age of the smart regime, borderization operates at any scale.
From the intimate to the planetary, the proximate to the distant,
investments are made in the capacities for modulating mobilities.
Borderization, as Mbembe argues, exceeds the category of borders
precisely because it dynamically operates irrespective of movement,
territory, or event. Bodies, whether mobile or immobile; spaces, whether
under the auspices of the state or not; life, whether microscopic or
megafaunal; events, whether in the past or future, are reservoirs for
computational possibilities. They are standing reserves for data
extraction. But they are also liability sinks for uncertainty.

Information theory is the mathematics concerned with resolving
uncertainty. Uncertainty is entropy, disorder of the system. A society
of security can promise to eliminate uncertainty. A smart regime can
embrace the opportunities it presents. Donald Rumsfeld (2002), that
emblematic architect of post-9/11 brutalism, perhaps put it best:
"Reports that say that something hasn\'t happened are always interesting
to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we
know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we
know there are some things we do not know."

But of course, [knowing produces a **surfeit of unknowns**]{.underline}.
[Every attempt to resolve uncertainty will find it comes back
**multiplied** like the **many-headed hydra**]{.underline}. [A society
of security promises to do more than **eliminate** the
unknown]{.underline}. [It promises to gather the certainties not only
**now**]{.underline}, [but **always**]{.underline}. [It is the governing
of **every possible mode** of arrival]{.underline}. The telos of such an
ambition is a familiar one. [We\'ve seen this]{.underline} political
theology [before]{.underline}. [Today]{.underline}, however, [it is
revived through the dominion of a **smart regime**]{.underline}.
Someday, all-knowing shall come to pass and everything shall be gathered
up in all its certainties into one great ethnonationalist hard drive in
the sky. So say we all.

Critical imagination is ever watchful against that "irrepressible need
for adhesion to a collection of certainties" (24--25). It maintains its
vigilant defense against both Big Brother and Mammon. In truth, however,
totalizing systems never need appear. The mere prospect of their arrival
is enough to fuel speculations. Those speculations are enough to
generate markets and secondary markets. They are just real enough to
mobilize the writing of legal frameworks and regulations ready to
embrace the future fait accompli. [We invest in behavioral
futures]{.underline}. [We have faith in the foreclosure of
possibilities]{.underline}. Ours is a religion of nothing beyond our own
expectations. **[No butterfly shall flap its wings without every
possible outcome being always already algorithmically
known]{.underline}**.

In reality, [we live in a world that flickers between the **calculable**
and the **incalculable**]{.underline}. [Calculability is a substitution
for the known]{.underline}. **[A]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [is just another bill of goods sold under
the auspices of the smart regime]{.underline}. It is the proposal that
computers are superior because of their speed and objectivity. It is the
claim that algorithmic governance is a matter of cognition. [Computers
are **eminently rational**]{.underline}. [They **must come to govern**
precisely because they lack passions]{.underline}, [drives]{.underline},
[vested interests]{.underline}, [and interiority]{.underline}. All that
is left to determine is whether or not the moment has arrived when
machines think better than we do. [**All conflicts will be resolved**
when **everyone**]{.underline}, **[everything]{.underline}**, [and
**every place** is **watched over** and **administered to** by the
machines of loving grace]{.underline}.

Mbembe moves through an analysis of the political stakes in a
computational age by marking out the trials of reason. But here I wonder
if it might be productive to further consider how the distinction
between reason and unreason differs from the distinction between reason
and rationale. The former pair mark the distance between human and
animal, thought and passion, vested interests and general will. The
capacity for reason is the ground condition for liberal subjects. The
latter pair, however, entails a procedural matter. Rationale is a
bureaucratic form of domination; it is that which traps reason inside a
Weberian iron cage.

To return again to information theory, the difference between these
trials for reason matter quite a lot. The realpolitik of artificial
intelligence is machine learning. Machine learning is not an exercise in
reason but an exercise in algorithmic decision making. Moral reasoning
was never the goal. The entire question of intelligence is a red
herring. This is agency without reason, a complete deferral of our moral
responsibility. We shall not aspire under any terms to be, as President
George W. Bush put it, "the Decider."2

We shall cede even our authority to interpret that which has already
been decided. We do not say, "the algorithm decides x but instead we do
y." We say, "we shall do x because the algorithm says x. If we do y, we
shall rebuild the algorithm until it predicts that we would do y."
Artificial intelligence is unmeaningful. Machine learning is tautology.
There is an evacuation of theory, critique, or meaning in favor of
manufacturing correlations by insisting that maps and territories simply
must align.

Perhaps the futures of life and the futures of reason are being played
out through a political economy of rationales. [We **destroy ourselves**
even as we feel **powerless to stop destroying ourselves**]{.underline}.
[We must take care]{.underline}, however, [to notice that even
algorithmic governance has **variety** and **contingency**]{.underline}.
[Decisions produce a **surfeit of indecisions**]{.underline}. [There is
**never only**]{.underline} "**[the computational]{.underline}**."
Perhaps we would do well to take a cue from political philosopher Hanna
Pitkin\'s critique of Hannah Arendt\'s analytic interest in "the
social." Beware those categories that tempt us to see "an absence of
politics where politics belongs" (Pitkin 1998: 252).

Mbembe coins a phrase, one he has used before, and one this particular
reader can only hope forms the basis for his future work. That phrase is
"wave fronts of calculation" (27). It is a delightful play on wave-front
calculations, which are the mathematics for describing a dynamic surface
and its temporality by taking into account the contribution of every
single point. In that translation from mathematics to social theory
something emerges, a way forward for **[critical
imagination]{.underline}** within a smart regime.

Wave fronts of calculation [might provide a way for cultural analysts
to]{.underline} detect reformulations and emergences in an
always-shifting field of couplings between life and machine. We might
explore wave fronts of noncalculability, or follow the shape-shifting
surfaces of unknowns. We might even come to [recognize a **diaspora of
noncertainties** that might form the **basis of political struggle**
that is **in** but not **of** the smart regime]{.underline}. [Data
politics will require new levels of comfort with
**ambiguity**]{.underline}, [with ways of living and acting and
reasoning **before everything is resolved**]{.underline}. The task ahead
requires thinking financialization, calculability, mobilization,
governmentality, and border politics all at once. Critical imagination
requires camaraderie. Thus, we look forward to what we are sure will be
a robust and generative debate about "Futures of Life and Futures of
Reason." After all, [fields don\'t transform when **debates are
settled**]{.underline}; [they transform when **conversations
begin**]{.underline}.

### Link---Security Cooperation

#### European security cooperation is wedded to a [biopolitical regime]{.underline} of algorithmic violence by [data]{.underline}. The aff's outdated speculations miss how cybernetics have [reshaped]{.underline} security governance.

**Bellanova and Fuster, 19**---Postdoctoral Researcher at the University
of Amsterdam; Research Professor at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel's
Faculty of Law and Criminology (Rocco and Gloria, "Composting and
computing: On digital security compositions," European Journal of
International Security (2019), 4, 345--365, dml)

Well before the so-called Snowden revelations,23 CSS scholars had
already engaged with security technologies. In particular, [critical
researchers]{.underline} were among the first to [look at how
data-driven systems **(re)shape** the security governance of the
international]{.underline}. [They cast a light on the growing deployment
of biometric controls]{.underline}, [and the multiplication of databases
as security mechanisms]{.underline}.24 Focusing on data analytics,
[their work]{.underline} now [unpacks the forms of knowledge that
**underpin** data-led security practices]{.underline},25 [and
investigates the institutional relations that **organise**
sociotechnical assemblages]{.underline}.26 Often in conversation with
Surveillance Studies,27 critical security scholars have built a solid
literature on the many ways in which governmental and private actors use
digital data to govern populations. However, [what is **often
missing**]{.underline} in these accounts [is **proper attention** to the
diverse roles of]{.underline} (digital) [data]{.underline}. [Data are
implicitly understood as if they were just]{.underline} '**[out
there]{.underline}**', [**naturally available** in great
quantity]{.underline}, [as an **obvious by-product** of our digital
age]{.underline}. Even when critical scholars think of data as the
data-doubles of individuals,28 the tendency is to present them in rather
immaterial terms. For instance, [the digital format of data is
considered as a **mere facilitator** for the spread of algorithmic
governance]{.underline}. [It is **only seldom** thought of as a
**crucial site of bio-** and **disciplinary politics**]{.underline},
that is, [where a]{.underline} '[**whole range of
dec**isions]{.underline} that affect the look, feel, experience, and
workings of a medium' [happen]{.underline}, and where 'a set of rules
according to which a technology can operate' are decided and tentatively
imposed upon others.29 In other words, in most CSS literature, data are
not something to be problematised and accounted for. They are assumed as
a given, an instrumental entity that just makes the work of those who
govern easier, and that facilitates exchange and cooperation among
security actors.

Increasingly, however, this view about data and security practice is
evolving. For instance, Evelyn Ruppert et al. state 'that [data has a
**performative power** that is **resignifying political
life**]{.underline}'. 30 Their perspective opens up a more historical
and sociological approach of datafication processes. Their main focus is
on the social dynamics that give meaning to data practices. As they
note, 'data is not an already given artefact that exists ... but an
object of investment ... that is produced by the competitive struggles
of professionals who claim stakes in its meaning and functioning'. 31
There is great value in this kind of approach. For instance, Didier
Bigo's study of data analysts working in security agencies shows how
**[the very accumulation of data becomes a powerful justification to
shape any further vision of European security
cooperation]{.underline}**.32 Moreover, research carried out in the same
vein casts a light on how [diverse security agencies rely on data as
valuable capital to **establish transnational**]{.underline} and
public-private **[relations]{.underline}**,33 [and to **govern at a
distance**]{.underline}.34

Researchers focusing on pre-emptive security unpack an important facet
of data politics. Their studies show how [the present and the past
become **data sources** for visualising a]{.underline}
'**[speculative]{.underline}**' [future]{.underline}, [which becomes the
**informational ground** on which **security decisions** about action
can be taken today]{.underline}.35 These works highlight the crisis of
the representational model through which we generally understand data.
What security actors work with, according to Louise Amoore, is mainly a
'data derivative \[that\] is not centred on who we are, nor even on what
our data says about us, but on what can be imagined and inferred about
who we might be -- on our very proclivities and potentialities'. 36 In
other words, the power of data does not lie in their conveying
information about us or about a given state of existing affairs. Data --
and in particular [digital data]{.underline} -- [have **value** for
security actors because they are composable into]{.underline} what
Amoore calls [a]{.underline} '**[mosaic]{.underline}**', that is, [the
**backdrop justification** of a security decision that aims to prevent a
future state of affairs from coming into being]{.underline}.37 Her work
highlights how this post-representational use of data in security
practice is highly problematic. First of all, [it is **difficult** for
those who are governed to **challenge** a mosaic whose tiles are often
**shrouded by secrecy**]{.underline}, [and whose selection criteria are
**not disclosed** by security actors]{.underline}.38 But it is also
problematic for some security practitioners. As Amoore notes,
'[\[t\]he]{.underline} "real time [decision]{.underline}" ... [is
**simply read off** from the derivative]{.underline} -- [**replacing**
the]{.underline} agonism and [radical uncertainty of decision and
placing responsibility in the realm of response]{.underline}.' 39 [This
form of automation]{.underline} -- or 'decision support' system, in the
official discourse of some institutions40 -- [**redefines** the role and
power of]{.underline} some [security actors]{.underline}. For instance,
it disempowers those that have no say in what is left to 'real
decision\[s\]', that is, the seemingly mundane adjustments of a security
composition's parameters.41 In sum, this literature foregrounds the
necessity to take seriously the diverse ways in which data become part
of a security composition, and how they affect the other elements of the
same composition.

### Impact---Algorithmic Violence

#### Algorithmic violence permeates [every level]{.underline} of digitalized data infrastructures from the [moment of their creation]{.underline}. Err neg---you should [overcorrect]{.underline} in your decision process to prioritize cybernetic violence against the [global periphery]{.underline} that their Western authors [never account for]{.underline}.

**Jacobsen, 21**---Senior Researcher, Center for Military Studies,
University of Copenhagen (Katja, "Toward a Critique of Algorithmic
Violence," International Political Sociology (2021) 15, 121--150, dml)

Put differently, [algorithmic violence begins **much before** the biased
and discriminatory processing of data]{.underline}, [with all its tacit
injustices and violence]{.underline}. Moreover, [the type of violence
implied at the level of the **very making** of]{.underline}
machine-readable [data infrastructures **looks different** if we **shift
attention to the global periphery**]{.underline}. Accordingly,
[exploring the force needed to make computation possible must include
attention to force and violence at **different points** and **different
contexts** of data]{.underline} "**[collection]{.underline}**" [and
**infrastructuring**]{.underline}. Introducing contemporary security and
intervention technologies as a lens onto the making of digital
infrastructures and increasingly pervasive forms of data collection, as
key elements when discussing algorithmic violence, enables much-needed
attention to global power relations, beyond racial biases in algorithms.

[Various contemporary intervention technologies]{.underline}---be they
[**military** or **humanitarian**]{.underline}---[entail the
transformation of]{.underline} fingerprints, iris patterns or other
"unique **[physical characteristics]{.underline}**" [into]{.underline}
digitalized, machine-readable **[data]{.underline}**.
[Biometric]{.underline} fingerprint or iris scan [technologies are used
not only by the **US military** to register Afghan citizens]{.underline}
encountered in Afghanistan, [but also by **numerous other intervention
actors**]{.underline}, [including **humanitarian** and **development
agencies**]{.underline} (Johns 2017; The Engine Room and Oxfam 2018;
Lindskov Jacobsen 2019). Sometimes the setting in which such
non-military agencies collect biometric data from individuals is a
setting where the US military is also conducting counterterror
operations, as in Afghanistan or Somalia.

Looking at [the **widespread use** of intervention technologies like
biometrics offers **illustrative examples** of practices in the global
periphery that entail the making of **enormous amounts** of]{.underline}
machine-readable data, including [**sensitive data** from vulnerable
populations seeking aid and protection]{.underline} from humanitarian
agencies. Beyond the US military, a wide range of agencies use
intervention technologies that more or less explicitly partake in the
production of a data infrastructure that then enables subsequent
algorithmic processing aimed, for example, at identifying targets or
suspects.

Besides extending the analysis "before" algorithmic processing, it is
also important to extend our critique to one that engages with, and
makes visible how, the making of machine-readable data plays out [in the
**global periphery**]{.underline}, including [**critical differences**
in]{.underline} "**[data generating]{.underline}**"
[conditions]{.underline} and how such differences [translate into
**specific expressions of violence**]{.underline}. While for some the
cost of declining to give up your biometric data could simply be the
convenience of accessing your phone only by the touch of your
finger(print), even this is misleading as machine-readable data may be
collected even if you do not access your phone using fingerprint
biometrics. Yet, the point to stress here is the importance of
recognizing that [analyses that look at]{.underline}
"**[Western]{.underline}**" [contexts are **not representative** of the
**multiple forms of violence** related to data gathering]{.underline},
[data retention]{.underline}, [etc]{.underline}. (see also Jacobsen
2012; Frowd 2017). **[Empirical evidence]{.underline}** from two types
of intervention contexts [illustrates this point]{.underline}.

In some intervention contexts, declining to give up biometric data
entails much more than foregoing convenience. [In **most** intervention
contexts]{.underline}, [the cost of declining to give up personal data
like biometrics is **far more consequential** than for]{.underline}
"**[Western citizens]{.underline}**." Imagine being a refugee in need of
assistance, with nowhere else to turn than to UNHCR. Yet, UNHCR has
decided to make biometric registration a standard procedure when
assisting refugees (Lindskov Jacobsen 2017; Madianou 2019). Thus,
declining to give up biometric data (which algorithms may later process)
might in such cases entail far more than giving up convenience. [It
could potentially have **fatal implications**]{.underline}, [if it
results in individuals being **denied assistance** or]{.underline} in
individuals **[deciding not to register]{.underline}** because of data
sharing concerns. The point to stress here is the different
circumstances under which machine-readable data are being generated in
various intervention contexts in the global periphery. Besides
differences in meaningful opt out possibilities, another issue is the
difference in age limit. The example that most vividly illustrates this
is the recent trialing of fingerprint biometrics for infants in various
intervention contexts in the global periphery, sometimes involving
humanitarian agencies (Parker 2019). In the EU, as another example, the
age at which fingerprints are required for visa applications is
currently twelve years.

Further illustrative of differences---differences with potentially
violent implications---between the making of machine-readable data in
"Western" contexts, is the fact that once collected by UNHCR, the policy
is to keep biometric data indefinitely, even once an individual ceases
to be a refugee. Not only does this policy differ significantly from
restrictions on biometric data retention in, for example, the EU, these
examples also illustrate crucial differences at the level of the very
making of machine-readable data infrastructures. These are differences
that a critique of algorithmic violence must help make visible, with
attention to how they translate into a differential distribution of
security/insecurity.

Moreover, [even in cases where an individual agrees to give up biometric
data]{.underline}, [this too risks bringing **added
insecurity**]{.underline}, for example, [in the form of risks of
**retaliation**]{.underline} from Al Shabaab in Somalia. [If **Al
Shabaab** gains access to biometric data showing exactly which
individuals have received aid from Western organizations]{.underline}
(that Al Shabaab sees as an enemy), [this could have **fatal
repercussions**]{.underline} for individuals, who cannot readily deny
their iris pattern or fingerprint. [Data collection may also entail
violence in other ways]{.underline}, as when implicitly encouraging
illegal border crossings as part of the very journey required for
persons to have their data collected: "Almost a year after submitting
his application for family reunification, Abdul was informed by the
Immigration Service that his wife and children had to be DNA tested at a
Danish embassy in order to validate relations of kinship in the family.
His family therefore paid an 'agent' to help them undertake an illegal
cross-border journey to an embassy in a different country" (Olwig et al.
2019, 194).

In short, [there are **important forms** of violence at the **very point
of data collection** that need to be **included**]{.underline}, **[made
visible]{.underline}**, [and **understood**]{.underline} as part of our
critique of algorithmic violence. Indeed, [even if these forms of
violence happen **before** the algorithmic processing]{.underline},
[they are **crucial** given that the making of]{.underline}
machine-readable [data]{.underline} (e.g., the iris patterns of millions
of refugees) [is a **precondition** for subsequent algorithmic
processing]{.underline}. These data, generated in the context of various
contemporary intervention settings (military and humanitarian), form
part of [a broader data infrastructure]{.underline}. That infrastructure
[**itself** entails violence **even before** adding the algorithmic
processing of data]{.underline}, **[simply at the very point of
insisting on its massive collection]{.underline}**, sometimes justified
in the name of humanitarian protection. Put differently, [there is
violence in the form of **immediate disqualification** and **resulting
insecurity** as well as in the form of **future
uncertainty**]{.underline} (for what purposes may these data be accessed
and algorithmically processed) [that we **need** to attend
to]{.underline} when thinking about questions of algorithmic violence.
Appreciating that the generation of accessible, digitalized data is a
precondition for algorithmic processing, these examples should make
clear why, when thinking about algorithmic violence, we need to attend
to questions about the differential conditions under which such data are
generated, collected, stored, and shared. What [violence goes into the
**making** of]{.underline} the **[digitalized data
infrastructures]{.underline}** that computer-implementable instructions
can then tacitly process---[sometimes with **fatal
consequences**]{.underline}---as for the individual whose fingerprint
was allegedly lifted off an improvised explosive device in Somalia, and
recognized at a border-crossing point as he was trying to enter the
United States from Mexico (Kimery 2018)?

### Impact---Circumvention

#### Technology has [outpaced]{.underline} international law---zeroes aff solvency. 

**Maas, 19**---PhD Fellow, Centre for International Law, Conflict and
Crisis, University of Copenhagen (Maathijs, "International Law Does Not
Compute: Artificial Intelligence and the Development, Displacement or
Destruction of the Global Legal Order," Melbourne Journal of
International Law 20, no. 1 (July 2019): 29-57, dml)

The \'soft\' argument holds that [AI systems combine a number of
features that]{.underline} ensure they (and the changes they create)
**[will not be easily handled]{.underline}**, and that [there may be
**insufficient international political agreement** or **leeway** to
carry out]{.underline} at least some of the [important international
legal developments]{.underline} or \'patches\' specified above, 118
[functionally making it an **intractable challenge**]{.underline} or
puzzle [to international law]{.underline}. [This is not to suggest that
AI systems would be the only]{.underline} or first [technology to
threaten such non-incorporation]{.underline}. For instance, Michael
Glennon has argued that [both the **laws of war** and **international
regulation** of weapons are premised on]{.underline} the notion of
**[attributability]{.underline}** of attacks, [and]{.underline} that [in
so far as **cyber weapons** render it easy to **sidestep**]{.underline}
easy, reliable or timely [identification]{.underline}, [it is not
surprising]{.underline} that [there has been]{.underline} relatively
**[little meaningful]{.underline}** international law
**[regulation]{.underline}** of this technology. 119

Likewise, Picker has identified a number of common issues that arise at
the interface of technological change and international law. 120 [One
problem is **timing**]{.underline}: [international law can be **very
slow to accrete** and **react** to challenges]{.underline}. [Under the
**best** of circumstances]{.underline}, customary international [law may
be created in as little as **10** to **15 years**]{.underline}. 121
[While treaty processes are somewhat faster]{.underline}, 122 [both are
still **extremely slow** compared to technologies that can **rapidly
bypass** the status quo]{.underline}, [forcing a
**re-evaluation**]{.underline} of treaties.

However, [while failure to be proactive is problematic]{.underline}, the
problem of [stepping into a regime **before it is clear** how a
technology works also creates problems]{.underline}. 123 [Examples are
found in]{.underline} the early legal scholarship during the 1950s and
\'60s on regulating what was expected to be the imminent technological
capabilities of **[weather control]{.underline}**, 124 [or]{.underline}
the **[deep seabed mining]{.underline}** provisions of the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which ultimately may have
jumped the gun on the imminence and maturity of such seafloor mineral
exploitation technologies. 125 [The problem]{.underline} with AI [is
that]{.underline}, [rather than a **single technology**]{.underline},
its performance in [diverse applications can depend on **parallel
developments** in]{.underline} computer [hardware]{.underline}, [data
availability and]{.underline} (various schools of)
[software]{.underline}, **[rendering reliable]{.underline}**, **[trusted
predictions difficult]{.underline}**. Indeed, [**fast-moving emerging
technologies** such as **AI**]{.underline}, nanotechnology [and
**synthetic biology** create their own]{.underline}, [unique sets of
challenges]{.underline}, [which potentially render them **politically
contentious** to international law regimes]{.underline}
([and]{.underline} perhaps to [**many other governance strategies** in
general]{.underline}). For one, [many of these
technologies]{.underline}, [far from being **narrow** and
**domain-specific**]{.underline}, [offer **breadth** and **potential
power**]{.underline}. Their very versatility introduces pervasive
uncertainty as to the future course of their development and use. [This
makes it **hard** for different states to **accurately project** and
**anticipate**]{.underline} the social **[impacts]{.underline}** of the
technology.

Indeed, this is exacerbated by the fact that [rather than a
**single**]{.underline} \'**[technological trajectory]{.underline}**\',
[these technologies]{.underline} often comprise a host of diverse
clusters in schools of development and application, which [can advance
at different rates]{.underline} (creating uneven, stop-start advancement
in different applications), [or suddenly]{.underline}
\'**[unlock]{.underline}**\' [new capabilities in and for each
other]{.underline}.126 [The convergence of multiple
technologies]{.underline} (that may speed up one another\'s development,
or affect one another\'s modes of application), [or even simply their
simultaneous development and introduction]{.underline}, [render
regulatory oversight **difficult** at a national level]{.underline}, 127
[and treaty negotiation **perilous** at an international
one]{.underline}.

### Impact---Endocolonization

#### The cybernetic episteme causes [planetary endocolonization]{.underline}, where the automation of the planet forces colonialism [inwards]{.underline} in a spiral of [self-devouring violence]{.underline} that causes [extinction]{.underline}.

**Gandesha, 22**---Institute for the Humanities, Simon Fraser University
(Samir, "The Market Lives on Death: The Endocolonizing Logic of the
Fascist Moment," *Technology, Urban Space and the Networked Community*,
Chapter 2, 29-49, SpringerLink, dml)

[Present-day fascism]{.underline}, in contrast, [takes refuge in the
**past**]{.underline} as such: in a supposedly "great" America before
the Civil Rights Act (if not before the Civil War); in an authentic
homeland of the Magyars in Hungary; and in a purified India for Hindus
(Hindustan). In other words, contemporary [fascism makes little or no
claim on the future in an era of its **ecologically planned
obsolescence**]{.underline}. In this, [it is]{.underline}, as Aimé
Céasire had already pointed out in Discourse on Colonialism, a form of
European [colonialism **applied to**]{.underline} Europe
**[itself]{.underline}**---**[endocolonialism]{.underline}**, as it
were. Today, as we have seen in the Greek case, its weapons are German
banks rather than tanks. As I have written about elsewhere, we see this,
as well, in the willingness of that model of kumbaya "liberal
multiculturalism"---the Canadian state---to deploy the logic of the
exception to permit on-going large energy infrastructure projects
(hydro, LNG, and bitumen) under conditions of a COVID-19 lockdown.
Recalling the weaponization of disease in the earliest days of contact
between Indigene and Colonizer, this puts already vulnerable Indigenous
communities at serious risk of a health catastrophe. As the meme goes
"Genocide is not an essential service!" The same logic can be discerned
in the Modi Government's resource extraction agenda driving the war on
India's tribal peoples (Adivasis) in Chhattisgarh, not to mention in
Jair Bolsonaro's iron-fisted developmental programme in the Amazon
basin.

Spectres of fascism loom, then, as a response to the chronic financial
and ecological crisis of capitalism. Fascism in the twentieth century
offered, in part, a solution to the economic slump via an acceleration
of the extraction of absolute and relative surplus value from living
labour by smashing the revolutionary Left, independent trade unions, and
other working-class institutions. This was, indeed, the original meaning
of Mussolini's (and Gentile's) idea of fascism based on the image of
what was called, in Latin, fasces, a bundle of rods and protruding axe
blade symbolizing the penal powers of the Roman state wielded by the
magistrate. Fascism entailed, then, the binding together of the rods of
the state, capital, and labour. It is, perhaps, telling that both the US
and French Republics adopted and maintained this proto-fascistic Roman
symbolism through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In contrast to its anti-human twentieth-century form,
[contemporary]{.underline} "**[post-human]{.underline}**" [fascism
centres on a **deepening of resource extraction** on the]{.underline}
very [precipice of]{.underline} massive deskilling of labour, and
[**widespread automation** and]{.underline} employment of robotics,
machine learning, and **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence to wit---[the prospective **obsolescence
of humanity itself**]{.underline}. [Such a logic entails]{.underline}
what, in Critique of Black Reason, Achille Mbembe calls
[the]{.underline} "**[becoming Black of the world]{.underline}**," [the
creation of]{.underline} "**[abandoned subjects]{.underline}**":

[There are **no more workers**]{.underline} as such. There are [only
**laboring nomads**]{.underline}. If yesterday's drama of the subject
was exploitation by capital, [the tragedy of the multitude]{.underline}
today [is that they are unable to be exploited at all]{.underline}.
[They are **abandoned subjects**]{.underline}, relegated to the role of
[a]{.underline} "**[superfluous humanity]{.underline}**."

[This superfluousness now becomes clear as]{.underline} governments, by
omission or commission amidst the pandemic, put members of society
deemed surplus as well as workers, particularly people of colour, at
grave risk of contracting or even dying from the virus (a recent UCSF
study conducted in San Francisco's Mission District showed that 95% of
positive cases were Latinx). Of course, it could be argued that human
labour has never appeared more "essential" than in this historical
moment. Yet, [states are]{.underline} also [showing themselves **quite
willing** to]{.underline} put essential workers at such an extreme
**[risk]{.underline}** as to even die en masse for want of PPE, for
example. MTA conductor and writer, Sujatha Gidla, reports her co-workers
as saying "we are not essential, we are sacrificial" (New York Times, 6
May).

In his depiction of the aftermath of **[catastrophe]{.underline}**,
[possibly **nuclear war**]{.underline}, in Endgame, Samuel Beckett
presents the destruction of nature as taking a specific spatial
configuration in which the dialectic of time, itself, has seemingly come
to a standstill. He shows, in coldly unsentimental though often
humorously ribald terms, the obsolescence of human beings, reduced as
they are to pure existence, and subordinated to the inscrutable
machinations of geopolitical forces beyond their understanding and
control. The necessary supplement to Endgame, according to Stanley
Cavell, is Kubric's Cold War masterpiece Dr. Strangelove.

Beckett depicts the parents of his anti-hero, Hamm, as literally reduced
to a form of societal refuse, having been confined to garbage
bins---perhaps signifying for us today, all-too painfully, the perilous
state of nursing homes---warehouse-coffins for human beings poised
somewhere between life and death, waiting for an end to the excruciating
game of waiting. They wax nostalgic ("Ah, the good old days," sighs
Nell) about the days when they were provided with sand, rather than
sawdust, in their metallic cloisters, a signifier of happier times spent
on the beach rather than of a nature that is now "corpsed." [The
catastrophe of the **present** and its relation to the]{.underline}
recent [**past** forms a continuum of the **same unfolding
disaster**]{.underline} Walter Benjamin writes about in his final text
"On the Concept of History" before his desperate flight from the Nazis
and consequent suicide in Port Bou. Today, [governments seem prepared to
sacrifice the **elderly**]{.underline}, [the **infirm**]{.underline},
**[poor]{.underline}**, **[indigent]{.underline}**,
**[Black]{.underline}**, [and **brown** to the **iron laws of the
market**]{.underline}. Republican Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan
Patrick, recently suggested that grandparents might consider sacrificing
their health and lives for their grandchildren, which is to say, for the
health of the economy. But this logic is nothing new. It was previously
discernible in each press release from myriad corporate head offices of
massive downsizings producing an immediate, dramatic uptick in their
share prices. The market lives on death (Fig. 2.2).

If we take as our definition the classic account of fascism as that
revolutionary mass movement comprising an alliance between industrial
capital and the petite bourgeoisie ranged against the working class and
its political organizations, [in the context of **imperialist
rivalries** and **discrete capitalist crises** of
overproduction]{.underline}, then it is far from clear that what we face
today can be described as "fascism." After the defeat of organized
labour, there is precious little resistance to [dead labour's machinic
extraction of surplus value from living]{.underline}. Such a defeat
[**clears the way** for]{.underline} redoubled colonization and
**[endocolonization]{.underline}**, **[racism]{.underline}**,
**[militarism]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}, ultimately,
**[war]{.underline}**.

### Impact---Ethics

#### The automation of the planet will [literally unravel]{.underline} the societal foundations of ethics and emotional interaction.

**Grove, 20**---Associate Professor of International Relations at The
University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (Jairus, "From geopolitics to
geotechnics: global futures in the shadow of automation, cunning
machines, and human speciation," International Relations, 2020, Vol.
34(3) 432--455, dml) \[expanded 100,000 to "a hundred thousand," denoted
by brackets\]

In Cavell's account [the general economy of violence that characterized
the sadism of slavery could **return again**]{.underline} but
differently. Rather than a great chain of being or the superiority of
some races over others, [the **very concept** of violence as a category
**distinct** from force or change could be **lost**]{.underline}.
Although extreme, [can we **not already see** this transformation
underway in the **extreme forms of instrumentality** that characterize
decisions regarding **collateral damage**]{.underline}, **[counter-value
targeting]{.underline}**, [or economized discourse on **immigration**
and **refugees**?]{.underline}56

More than a transformation of moral economies, the
**[automation]{.underline}** of humans [and]{.underline} the
**[augmentation]{.underline}** of humans, [represent]{.underline}s [the
possibility of making **physical** and **habitual** what is now
**normative** and **discursive**]{.underline}. Resembling Cavell, David
Roden proposes what he calls [the]{.underline} disconnection thesis, in
which Cavell's [**nightmare scenario** unfolds only among some humans
for whom the sentimentality of]{.underline} bodies, reproduction, and
[human connection **impede** further evolution of the
species]{.underline}.57 Whether it is those who dream of a singularity
in which human consciousness becomes digital or one of the U.S. veterans
who have had mood altering computer chips implanted into their brains,
some humans will increasingly alter or altered their brain-body networks
to alter their cognitive and perceptive capacities.58

During the summer of 2018 researchers at the University of Washington
and Carnegie Mellon successfully networked three humans via EEGs and
transcranial magnetic stimulation. The three individuals were able to
collaborate to play a simple video game resembling Tetris.59 The
participants were able to communicate and sense each others' thoughts
without the use of language or even being in the same room. Similar
experiments have successfully sent text message from one side of the
country to the other making at least a limited version of brain to brain
communication a reality.

[In the **dark light of geopolitics** one can imagine what today takes
the form of **geographic** and **class divides** in connectivity and
medicine taking the form of different classes and territories of
**consciousness** and **communication**]{.underline}. [Given the
**already gossamer fragility** of international solidarity and
trans-border empathy one can further imagine cyborg cultures **quite
literally tuning out** of the world left behind]{.underline}. Roden's
disconnection thesis argues that [as these new forms of networks and
augmentation develop so too will **cultures** and **moral awareness**
diverge]{.underline}.60 For those without the need or desire to use oral
language accelerating the pace of technological change within new kinds
of communities it is not difficult to follow Cavell to the precipice of
his posthuman horror. [While the biological racial fictions of
**colonialism**]{.underline}, **[apartheid]{.underline}**, [and
**settler-colonialism** still hold on in the face of overwhelming
scientific evidence to the contrary how much more would real material
differences in forms of life **accelerate existing geopolitical
violence**?]{.underline}61 [Even the **beginnings** of disconnection
could **intensify** the already renewed fights between extractive
industrial modernity and]{.underline} those [indigenous
communities]{.underline} fighting for their ancestral lands and ways of
life. And what of the swelling numbers of multi-generationally
unemployed masses who will lack the capital to upgrade? One can imagine
class no longer being marked by linguistic markers or knowledge of wine
but the physical ability to interface with white color working spaces.
More and more companies have already begun microchipping their employees
for security and tracking crossing the threshold of the skin in the
process of making labor.62 The digital divide in labor of who can and
cannot telecommute is already determining the patterns of employment and
unemployment in the first 6months of COVID-19 shutdowns.

The speciation of interfaces and sensory capabilities could amplify the
already growing trend.63 The point of Roden and Cavell's thought
experiments are to show that [such a separation would be **more** than
just a **return** to or **intensification** of racial or class
divisions]{.underline}. Instead [the **very embodied character** of
moral appreciation]{.underline}, [the shared languages and
cultures]{.underline}, [the perceptive capacities to experience beauty
or tragedy could be **altered** to the point that the **diffracted
species** of once human beings would live in a state more closely
resembling]{.underline} that of Homo sapiens 100,000 \[[a hundred
thousand]{.underline}\] [years ago in which there were **multiple
species**]{.underline} of upright anthropoids [and none of them could
live without the fear of **predation**]{.underline} by other non-human
animals or each other. [The medium of encounter **fundamentally
altered**]{.underline}. However, in this speculative history of the
future [the divergence would not have been by happenstance but to **lock
in interests** and **geopolitical advantage**]{.underline}.
**[Difference by design]{.underline}**.

[This may all seem too far-fetched]{.underline}. [How could humans lose
their **most basic capacity** for socio-emotional
intercourse?]{.underline} I want to argue that [things **need not change
that dramatically** to see the beginnings of such a
divergence]{.underline}. One can [look around a **crowded bus** filled
with people each glued to their smart phone]{.underline},
**[tables]{.underline}** of families at restaurants each [separated
by]{.underline} their individuated [devices or an **office** filled with
screens each telecommuting the pilot to a **drone**]{.underline} in the
field [thousands of miles away]{.underline} to see the beginnings of
such a speciation. [Or we could return to the **beginnings** of
international thought]{.underline}, the first moments of European
geopolitics and remember its multispecies beginnings when just 50 years
after the arrival of Christopher Columbus Bartolomé de las Casas pleaded
with the Castille thrown to recognize the soul and therefore humanity of
the 'Indios'. Instead, of course, the extermination continued which
treated the people of the Americas as 'piles of dung in the middle of
the road'.64 [Geopolitics was]{.underline} in some sense [**founded** on
the premise of **many** human species rather than **one** human
species]{.underline}.65 [The inability for so many to see their human
counterpoint at a moment of encounter]{.underline} in the new world
[speaks to the precedent of a **truly dark enlightenment**]{.underline}.
That is, [technological and martial advance **without any corresponding
moral awareness**]{.underline}. [A new such speciation that included the
inability to **even speak** to one another much less recognize some
**common heritage** or **shared community of value** would make the
efforts of]{.underline} Las Casas and [those who continue to fight
against the finishing of the settler-colonial project **entirely
potentially invisible**]{.underline}.

### Impact---Exchange Abstraction

#### Extinction? 

**Steuer, 19**---research fellow at the Centre for Applied Philosophy,
Politics, and Ethics (CAPPE) at the University of Brighton (Daniel,
"Prolegomena to Any Future Attempt at Understanding Our Emerging World
of War," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter 2, 33-36, dml)

[The danger]{.underline} of theoretical mimesis [follows from the
**spell** cast by the universal monoculture and the **impoverishment**
of the imagination that accompanies it]{.underline}. **[Exchange
abstraction is]{.underline}** a **[real]{.underline}** abstraction; [it
informs our **thinking** and our **practices**]{.underline}---that is,
how we turn the world into the "world"---[to the point of
**disallowing** deviating practices and ways of acting and
experiencing]{.underline}. [The system of interconnected mechanisms for
the exchange of money]{.underline}, [energy]{.underline}, [and
information]{.underline} constitutes a medium that [**can no longer** be
analyzed according to conventional]{.underline} political, social,
economic, or military [categories]{.underline}. [The **escalating
nature** of this system]{.underline} is driven by the expansion of
capital and by the fact that it [**cannot be controlled** by any
normative regulations]{.underline}: it is a postnormative medium in
which techno-economic partisans---as (in-)dividuals--- replace
traditional subjects as agents.

Critical discourses often mimetically reproduce the system's properties
and therefore end up by posing Manichean alternatives. One of the most
perfect cases of the mimesis of universal monoculture is Bruce
Sterling's vision of a world built on what he calls "SPIMES,"
manufactured objects that

begin and end as data. They are designed on screens, fabricated by
digital means, and precisely tracked through space and time throughout
their earthly sojourn. SPIMES are sustainable, enhanceable, uniquely
identifiable, and made of substances that can and will be folded back
into the production stream of future SPIMES. Eminently data-mineable,
SPIMES are the protagonists of an historical process.178

This vision turns the nightmare of an all-pervasive IoT world (a world
in which everything is tagged and tracked) into the paradise of an
endless creative transformation, running as a frictionless machine, a
perpetuum mobile populated by "Wranglers," as he calls the "people
within an infrastructure of SPIMES."179

The disturbing aspect of Sterling's optimistic book is that, [in the
name of sustainable creativity]{.underline}, [it calls for a
techno-logistical world that would also **perfectly fit** the needs of
the **military planner**]{.underline}, **[security
expert]{.underline}**, [and **Caerus analyst**]{.underline}. [The
**nightmarish** aspect]{.underline} of this vision **[quickly becomes
clear]{.underline}** if we substitute Foucault's neoliberal homo
oeconomicus for the "Wrangler." As "an entrepreneur of himself,"180 he
represents the commodification not only of human labor but also of the
human body, the human being as such. He is "an arbitrary bundle of
'investments,' skill sets, temporary alliances (family, sex, race), and
fungible body parts."181 This individual is lodged "within the framework
of a multiplicity of diverse enterprises. . . . And finally, the
individual's life itself---with his relationships to his private
property, for example, with his family, household, insurance and
retirement---must make him into a sort of permanent and multiple
enterprise."182

[It is **not at all inconceivable** that it will soon be possible to
**mortgage your body**]{.underline} (to promise your organs or tissue
for donation, for instance, in order to raise capital or service your
debts), [in particular if]{.underline}---in line with the fundamental
contradiction of universal monoculture---[the very body]{.underline} of
the neoliberal (in)dividual [will be seen as **nothing but
data**]{.underline}. The Visible Human Project, [the
translation]{.underline} of an entire human corpse into data sets, which
began in the early 1990s, [rests on]{.underline} "[an equation of
**digital code** with **vitality**]{.underline}" [and on
the]{.underline} "[desire for bodies to behave as **closed mechanical
systems**]{.underline} with reversible temporalities, rather than as
non-reversible, chaotic systems which necessarily move towards
death."183 Whether or not the project is medically useful, it bears all
the hallmarks of our universal monoculture. In particular, the changes
that the body undergoes in the process of being translated into data are
considered a technical problem that can be solved. [The categorical
difference between life and death is **slowly erased** by technological
improvements]{.underline} [until flesh-and-blood bodies and digital
revenants become **indistinguishable**]{.underline}.184

Foucault's lectures from 1977/78 and 1978/79 have been read as "a
coherent argument for the positive force of globalization."185 And, in
fact, one might go further and suggest that, in his notions of power and
the dispositif, one can observe a mimetic approval of neoliberalism (and
universal monoculture). Then there are Jean-Luc Nancy's reflections on
"struction," on a world in which Being has been replaced by "being with"
and in which it is "truly not a question of order or organization that
is implied by con- and instruction." Aimed against extraction and
hierarchy, they end with "the heap, the non-assembled ensemble. Surely
it is contiguity and co-presence, but without a principle of
coordination."186 Again there arises the question of how to distinguish
between the Manichean alternatives, between the liberated (and
liberating?) nonassembled ensemble and an all-pervasive, invisible
coordination that favors partial interests.

Another example is Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's nomadic war
machine.187 Its form corresponds to global partisan warfare; it turns
the planet into a "smooth space" onto which "striated spaces" are
projected (see the discussion of flow markets, the global frontierland,
and drone targeting above). Nomadism is not the opposite of hierarchical
or state power; rather, state power contains nomadism and vice versa.

In the field of sociology, we find Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam's
strategic action fields (SAFs), "the basic structural building block of
modern political/organizational life in the economy, civil society, and
the state."188 SAFs form a fleeting world of metastable "socially
constructed arenas" in which "actors with varying resource endowments
vie for advantage:"189 "All the meanings in a field can break down
including what the purpose of the field is. . . . \[T\]he process of
contention is ongoing and the threats to an order always present to some
degree."190

But perhaps the most perfect example of theoretical mimesis is Jean
Baudrillard's "ultimate reality of impossible exchange," the "Impossible
Exchange Barrier."191 Here, universal exchange is turned on its head.
Setting out from the observation that "there is no equivalent to the
world,"192 Baudrillard argues that there are no equivalences in the
world, that a "continuity of the Nothing . . . grounds the possibility
of the Great Game of Exchange,"193 and he concludes that the "whole
problem is one of abandoning critical thought" as it is now
anachronistic.194 Instead, the "task of thought" is to make the world
"even more enigmatic and unintelligible."195 This, despite the
perceptive qualities of the text, is the ultimate confirmation of
universal monoculture through its seeming reversal.196

CONCLUSION

[The dystopian endpoint is **not** a world that has been taken over by
machines]{.underline} and programs that develop and follow their own
agenda---[the singularity nightmare]{.underline}. [The **real dystopian
endpoint** is a world in which the process of **mutual formation**
between humanity and its technological inventions]{.underline} has
produced a state in which both the human and the nonhuman worlds [are
modeled on]{.underline} just one, in its foundational principles very
limited, invention---[the **information processor**]{.underline}---[and
there is **no longer any imaginative space** in which alternatives might
be created]{.underline}. [The danger is neither **technology destroying
the world**]{.underline}---this is also a danger but a different
one---[nor the **reduction** of the social to the technological but the
social becoming **locked** into the technological to the point of
**indistinction**]{.underline}. If this happens within a capitalist
economic framework, then [the result will be]{.underline} a kind of
dysfunctional stasis, [a **lingering apocalypse**]{.underline}, [life as
**continual warfare**]{.underline}, with techno-economic partisans
**[permanently]{.underline}** being [engaged in **instantaneous value
extraction**]{.underline}.197 The indistinctions that today make
themselves felt empirically and in attempts at theoretical explanation
will have become a complete homogeneity that may no longer even deserve
the adjective "social."

### Impact---Necropolitics

#### The cybernetic episteme necessitates [global necropolitical violence]{.underline}, where death becomes [more profitable than life]{.underline} to genocidal dictatorships, and makes [nuclear war]{.underline} more likely.

**Grove, 20**---Associate Professor of International Relations at The
University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (Jairus, "From geopolitics to
geotechnics: global futures in the shadow of automation, cunning
machines, and human speciation," International Relations, 2020, Vol.
34(3) 432--455, dml) \[Wiener Filter equation omitted\]

The automation of war and the reduction of human troop sizes has a
similar effect. [Wars aided by drones and]{.underline} as a result
significantly [smaller numbers of soldier casualties continue on for
**decades**]{.underline} in a kind of sustainable warfare.28 [The
political and material cost of casualties]{.underline} like the material
cost of striking [are being **removed** from the political equation
making states **less** and **less accountable**]{.underline} in the case
of social justice and the pursuit of violence outside their borders.

[The feedback between these two trends is **potentially
catastrophic**]{.underline}. [At the same time that war becomes
**easier**]{.underline}, [governments become **less accountable** to
their people]{.underline}, [and people are deprived of the means to
support themselves]{.underline}, [it is also the case that people will
**matter less** to their governments as they will not possess the labor
power to cause pain to the economic productivity of the
country]{.underline} by means of striking nor the capacity to refuse to
fight. Zygmunt Bauman has spoken of disposable populations, a kind of
human waste or surplus where the value of one's existence is meaningless
for the state.29 However, [we ought to go further down this path by way
of]{.underline} Achille **[Mbembe's]{.underline}** creeping
**[necropolitics]{.underline}**.30 [It is not merely that]{.underline}
chronically or even intergenerational unemployed [people have **no
value**]{.underline}; [it is that]{.underline} the [**marginalization**
and]{.underline} even **[murder]{.underline}** of people [can now
**generate value**]{.underline}. In what Mbembe refers to as the
'enclave economies' of war machines:

[The concentration of activities connected with the extraction of
valuable resource]{.underline} around these enclaves [has]{.underline},
in return, [turned the enclaves into **privileged spaces of war** and
**death**]{.underline}. [War itself is **fed** by the increased sales of
the products extracted]{.underline}.31

In these enclave economies fueled by petroleum, diamonds, but
increasingly things like lithium or even sand or water, [the **outright
murder** of people]{.underline}, [clearing space]{.underline},
[generates value even in the **supposedly post-resource** digital
economy]{.underline}.32 However, beyond the instrumental value of
security there is also the explosion of security services as its own
economic sector rather than as a merely means to secure other economic
sectors. International security corporations such as Wackenhut
industries, once a private prison service provider in the U.S., now
generate profits from refugee management in Australia and Europe.33 The
nearly 200billion dollar private security industry and \$1917billion
dollar defense sector suggest that [the economy of making death and
deprivation is **more** than merely a means]{.underline}. [What **few**
normative and legal limitations exist on the lethality of these
corporations and institutions could **disappear**]{.underline}. [This is
**already taking place** in the global South and amongst
African-Americans and indigenous people around the planet]{.underline}.

However, [one can foresee]{.underline}, [with **little
imagination**]{.underline}, [the **extreme injustices** of the
contemporary era as a **general condition of global life**]{.underline}.
What requires imagination on our part is reaching a turning point where
these crimes become themselves normative, that is, the 'good' the state
pursues. Contrary to our sensibilities [such ideologies **already
exist** and are]{.underline} even **[gaining attention]{.underline}**
outside the obscure chat rooms where they began.

Under the heading of 'negative messianism', Mbembe reviews the growing
movement of the 'Dark Enlightenment', 'a political religion. . .
\[that\] calls for the exit from democratic society and total corporate
and absolute dictatorship'.34 The movement calls for a global, racial,
culling of the population in the name of 'human biodiversity' and
expounds the value of using racially inferior populations for radical
experimentation to jumpstart technological breakthrough. If this sounds
too implausible even for speculation it is worth considering the spate
of recent terrorist attacks in the U.S. by the vanguard of the Dark
Enlightenment. The mass shooter who killed 20 people in El Paso Texas in
August of 2019 posted his Dark Enlightenment manifesto before beginning
his rampage.35 In 2020, there have been multiple attacks by the
so-called Boogaloos who have infiltrated the U.S. military and police
forces and seek to spark the Dark Enlightenment by escalating the Black
Lives Matter protests into a full scale civil war.36 And then there is
the most famous and vocal theorist of the Dark Enlightenment, Steve
Bannon, who in addition to being a key architect of the Donald Trump
administration, works tirelessly to build the Dark Enlightenment
movement amongst the burgeoning far right of Europe.37 Whether this
world view succeeds or actually becomes normative globally is not really
the point. Instead, as is the mode in the speculation here I propose
that in the burgeoning Dark Enlightenment movement we can see a
political community built around necropolitics as a value rather than a
necessary evil.

It would be too much to draw a direct line from the Dark Enlightenment
to all of the neo-nationalist, neo-authoritarian, and neo-fascist
movements around the planet. However, [the accelerating global right
wing has been **institutionalized** at the **highest levels of power**
in liberal democratic nation-states]{.underline} such as the United
States, U.K. and India, [suggesting that liberal institutions **cannot
subsist on autopilot**]{.underline}. [Neo-authoritarian politics
have]{.underline} also [moved]{.underline} from shaping domestic
polities [to the shaping of the **international order**]{.underline}.38

In such an order, what would liberal democratic states look like? [The
**constraints** on the **genocidal dictatorships** of the twentieth
century was]{.underline} of course [that they needed a **substantial
portion** of their populations]{.underline}. [Genocide could only be
pursued against **minority** populations]{.underline}. State behavior
even in the extremes of the Nazi state among others still required full
mobilization and therefore at some level the necessity of willing
obedience even if not quite legitimacy that could be supplemented
through terror.39

[What of the behavior of future states for whom their people
are]{.underline} in some sense [an **afterthought**]{.underline}? At a
minimum [the basic conceits of survival that underwrite practices like
deterrence or coercion would **change dramatically**]{.underline}. The
very logic and mechanics of biopolitics would have to change. Without a
necessary or strict relationship to the nation, would states differ
significantly from some kind of corporate entity? Would the state more
closely resemble the ancien regime? What would become of territoriality?
These are the grammatical questions raised by the dark imagination of an
automated future sufficiently comprehensive to create the material
condition whereby a state could survive without the majority of their
population's cooperation.

[Can we not **already see** the outlines of such a future in the
decisions of **Bolsanaro**]{.underline}, **[Trump]{.underline}**,
**[Xi]{.underline}**, **[Modi]{.underline}**, [and
**Duterte**]{.underline}, [who **blithely write off millions** of their
own citizens in the face of COVID]{.underline}-19 and the nearly 50per
cent unemployment rate it has created where the virus has been allowed
total freedom of movement?40 One need not be conspiratorial to see how
quick authoritarian leaders have been to give up on disease containment
once the data came back regarding the overwhelming racial disparity in
COVID fatalities.41

If we consider the ways in which the shift from coal to oil changed the
character of economic and labor relations with states in the twentieth
century, [the]{.underline} nearly 50per cent [loss of jobs due to
**computerization**]{.underline} in the twenty-first century,42
[combined with a corresponding decline in the **necessity of humans**
for military power]{.underline}, then these new conditions [could
**change the very nature** of what a state is]{.underline}. The
biopolitical raison d'être of the nation-state which emerges in the
nineteenth century and becomes truly geopolitical in the twentieth
century is premised on the mobilization and securing of a national
population.43 The revolutionary states emerge from and rationalize the
hyphen of the nationstate as essential both in terms of democratic
values and military-economic necessity. What will emerge in the
aftermath of such necessities and values is the horizon of alternative
futures we must consider.

"Hello," whispered Montag, fascinated as always with the dead beast, the
living beast. . .

"It doesn't like me," said Montag.

"What the Hound?" The Captain studied his cards. "Come off it. It
doesn't like or dislike. It just 'functions.' It's like a lesson in
ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide on for it. It follows through.
It targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. It's only copper wire,

A Wiener Filter or The Yellow Peril

The equation above is called a Wiener Filter. In mathematical terms,
Norbert Wiener used it with a number of other steps to calculate the
future. Despite the claims in the first section that the future does not
exist, the territory or probable limits of the future do, at least most
of the time. What Wiener was representing mathematically was that even
with little data on which one would normally make a prediction you can
define the space of possibility or in Wiener's terms the distribution of
probabilities even for non-linear or non-existent causal systems. In
practical terms it meant that artillery could be automated to shoot
where planes were going to be rather than where they were when the radar
signal returned. The mathematicians did this by considering and then
modeling the limits of the system being predicted.

It is impossible to predict what an individual pilot will choose to do
but it is possible to describe in mathematical terms what a pilot is
capable of doing and similarly what a plane with a particular maximum
velocity was capable of doing. The predictions made by the Wiener Filter
allowed the artillery guns to fire in a significantly more restricted
area with minimal radar information rather than just blasting away at
the sky in hopes of hitting something. According to Steve Heims, more
predictable systems like the V2 rocket could be successfully targeted
and shot down 99 out 100 times by the Wiener Filter.44 The seemingly
'dumb' artillery could adjust or read their environment and work in
concert adjusting further as information from rudimentary radar systems
or the assemblage of radar, operators, and canons. The artillery was in
the most basic sense becoming aware.

Wiener's 'solution' which made unpredictable systems targetable was
another version of what Claude Shannon very soon after solved for
communication with his theory of information. Shannon developed the
techniques which allow the efficient transmission of information through
imperfect media such as telephone lines by similarly modeling the range
of noise and compensating or repeating signal to exceed it. Rather than
predicting the noise which is impossible because of its chaotic nature
Shannon was able to treat all noise as a system rather than individual
events of noise such that the range of noise could stand in place of the
individual incidents. In both cases, the breakthroughs of Wiener and
Shannon created the world of computers, the internet, automation, and
machine learning we now inhabit. All systems after Wiener and Shannon
could be treated in some sense as information and communication problems
to be solved.45

After his experience in the war and further experiments after, Wiener
began to describe a more general principle of informatics and machine
technology. What he would later call the last science or the science of
everything saw every system, whether physical, chemical, mechanical,
biological, as computable and alterable. Following this insight Wiener
believed humanity was at the cusp of something unprecedented. In 1948,
he declared that a new kind of machine had emerged in the history of
human evolution. Although still rudimentary, cybernetic machines of the
1940s were capable for the first time of simple self-regulation based on
interactions with their external environment. Unlike thermodynamic
machines that sought equilibrium, cybernetic machines could pursue a
goal or objective in the world. Wiener referred to these new machines as
Bergsonian machines, after the French Philosopher Henri Bergson and his
idea of elan vital. 46 For Wiener, machines possessed for the first time
the spark of a vital impulse. While these Bergsonian machines have so
far disappointed the expectation of those hoping for and others fearing
human-like artificial intelligence, machinic intelligence, whether
learning algorithms or self-steering and targeting weapons systems, have
exploded into a variable rainforest ecology of new species.

What is important for the purposes of this article is that Wiener was
able to demonstrate that very simple feedback mechanisms could produce
complex emergent results or what 'appeared' like intelligence even if
the machines were not conscious of that intelligence. What I explore
throughout the rest of the section is how [**even small advances** in
machine intelligence could produce **dramatic changes**]{.underline} in
what we think of now as human dependent drones. [Already AI platforms
have the capacity to strategize and win complex games]{.underline} like
Go, [AI via drones have the capability to target or execute operations
on their own]{.underline}, [robots can 3D print and construct other
robots]{.underline}, that is, a simple form of reproduction. [The only
thing missing is]{.underline} what in philosophical terms we call
**[will]{.underline}** or desire. However, the insight from Wiener is
that [the difference between]{.underline} rudimentary [will
and]{.underline} a command [code is **insignificant**]{.underline} in
effect if a feedback exists between the machine and the external
environment which can shape or direct the now desiring machine. To put
it somewhat simply, [we **do not need** human]{.underline} general
[intelligence for robots to **change the world** and
**geopolitics**]{.underline}; [the world could **change overnight** if
mechanical life emerged or was released]{.underline} into the wild and
was as sophisticated, resilient and procreative as the cockroach.

We are already experiencing the burgeoning capability of cunning
machine. If one considers to the underlying political and economic
pressure to move away from human combatants not unlike the globalization
of the labor market more broadly, the incentives for innovations
continuing are difficult to deny.47 Even before 9/11 combat was becoming
too costly in both economic and political terms and therefore required
an alternative in order for empires and smaller states to stay afloat in
lean times. The globally modeled War on Terrorism brought the crises of
military expenditure still lingering after the Cold War to a head.
However, [the drive to cut costs and political liability **has not
stopped** at the battlefield]{.underline}. [Attempts to remove
humans]{.underline} further and further from the battlefield
[follows]{.underline} this inhuman trajectory [into the arena of
**decision-making** and **contestation**]{.underline}.48 [The reliance
on algorithmic warfare creates the opportunity for **increasingly
unilateral warmaking**]{.underline}. [Cunning machines]{.underline},
[not machines of **reason** but]{.underline} machines [capable of
**hunting** and **trapping**]{.underline}, [represent the possibility of
the command and control developed for **nuclear arsenals** with the
micro-scale to pursue and kill of **assassins**]{.underline} or special
forces.49

[This process of automating politics as well as war creates further
incentive for the development of]{.underline} increasingly [autonomous
machines and **actually undermines security** as it makes the capacity
to wage war **cheaper** and **more accessible** around the
**planet**]{.underline}. [The drive for more autonomous
machines]{.underline} is heading toward 'sustainable warfare', a kind of
weird parallel to sustainable development. Like sustainable development,
sustainable warfare really [makes warfare **endemic** rather than
providing a **real alternative** to war making]{.underline}. So war as
we know it may be coming to an end but a permeating martial
transformation is just getting started.

### Impact---Partisan Warfare\*\*\*

#### \*\*\*Note while prepping: Steuer uses the term "partisan" in its military context, to refer to "a member of an irregular military force formed to oppose control of an area by a foreign power or by an army of occupation by some kind of insurgent activity" as per Wikipedia, rather than in its more common context as someone with a political bias. 

#### The impact is a [constant apocalypse]{.underline} of [global partisan warfare]{.underline} in which humanity becomes [permanently potentially embroiled]{.underline} in a war against [itself]{.underline}.

**Steuer, 19**---research fellow at the Centre for Applied Philosophy,
Politics, and Ethics (CAPPE) at the University of Brighton (Daniel,
"Prolegomena to Any Future Attempt at Understanding Our Emerging World
of War," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter 2, 11-13, dml)

According to General Sir Rupert Smith, [industrial interstate war **no
longer exists**]{.underline}, and "[we are now engaged]{.underline},
[**constantly** and in **many permutations**]{.underline}, [in war
amongst the **people**]{.underline}."11 Whether written by practitioners
or scholars, literature in this area almost without exception observes
that [we are witnessing an **ever-increasing blurring** and **blending**
of phenomena]{.underline}, producing interconnected and overlapping
indistinctions. Yet, at the same time, most authors hold on to some
moral or normative distinction. For military and security practitioners,
these distinctions become framework conditions within a global security
paradigm and thus strategic factors. The binaries in these writings---
order (hierarchy) and chaos (swarms, "leaderless resistance"), rulers
and ruled, decision makers/actors and populations, narrators and
listeners, thugs and nonthugs---are ultimately construed in a Manichean
fashion.

[Let us]{.underline} first try to [imagine the **extreme endpoint** of
this increasingly blurred post-Westphalian landscape]{.underline}.
Following on from the principle ascribed to Napoleon by Carl
Schmitt---"il faut opérer en partisan partout où il y a des
partisan"12---we may name it **[global partisan warfare]{.underline}**.
Within this world, [the figure of the **techno-economic
partisan**]{.underline}---no longer telluric, no longer even cosmic, but
fundamentally without place or time: [a normless ideal
type]{.underline}---may take the form of the soldier, the business
person, the terrorist, the logistics operator, and so forth. This ideal
dystopian actor [can be inserted into **any context** and can take on
**any perspective**]{.underline}; her actions are [guided by methods of
analysis that are **universal**]{.underline}, **[purely
formal]{.underline}**, [and **indifferent to content**]{.underline}.13

Global Partisan Warfare: Mimetic Escalation

[There are **no differences anymore**]{.underline}. [Reciprocal action
is so amplified by globalization]{.underline}, the planetary reciprocity
[in which the **slightest event** can have repercussions on the **other
side of the globe**]{.underline}, [that violence is **always a length
ahead** of our movements]{.underline}. [Violence **steals a march** on
politics]{.underline}, [and technology **escapes our
control**]{.underline}. ---René Girard, Battling to the End

According to Clausewitz, war is a chameleon that changes appearance
according to the admixture of "blind natural instinct" (people), "free
activity of the soul" (the general and his army), and "reason"
(government), that is, passion, strategy (probabilities and chance), and
political logic.14 In René Girard's interpretation of the development of
this triad, [we are now]{.underline}, as Howard Caygill puts it,
"[**fully** and **irreversibly** engaged in an **apocalyptic logic of
escalation**]{.underline}."15 At the heart of it, I suggest, is the
figure of the partisan. His methods are adopted by the "regular" force,
radicalizing, in turn, the partisans' methods, which are then again
adopted by the regular force, and so on. As a result, [the theater of
confrontation becomes **increasingly dispersed** in
geographical]{.underline}, [temporal]{.underline},
[institutional]{.underline}, [and technological terms]{.underline}.
Today, the armies of [the technologically most advanced
states]{.underline} develop units that [operate in a **partisan
fashion**]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline}
"**[defend]{.underline}**" [what are seen as **global security
interests**]{.underline}, [while insurgents use global technological
infrastructure]{.underline} and other infrastructure. Thus, the
difference between the resistant "subjectivity of the partisan," whose
strategy "is vaporous as opposed to the movement of solid and liquid
masses characteristic of military subjectivity,"16 disappears.
Clausewitz, Caygill suggests, was interested in "the imaginative
response to chance over the combination of force and consciousness" and
in avoiding "the logic of escalation" that leads to a "final apocalyptic
battle."17 And yet [partisan strategies **do not avoid
escalation**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [they make the enemies
**permanently present** to each other]{.underline}, [even]{.underline}
([and especially]{.underline}) [in their]{.underline} physical
[absence]{.underline}. [Partisan escalation is a **partly
invisible**]{.underline}, **[silent escalation]{.underline}**. [Does
this **delay** the apocalypse or turn it into a **permanent
presence**?]{.underline}18

[In the protean universality of global partisan
warfare]{.underline}---[fought in **virtual** as well as **physical**
spaces]{.underline}---[**all** sides are **potentially attacker** and
**attacked**]{.underline}. They are "persecuted persecutors."19 If once
partisan warfare gave rise to new political communities, forging "bonds
of solidarity that grow out of the unconditional battle against a common
enemy,"20 then---once we come to today's techno-economic
partisan---these bonds of solidarity are no longer unconditional, and
the common enemy is as fleeting as these bonds. Any identity (or
destruction thereof) is a weapon rather than a cause or a consequence of
conflicts. Thus, absolute partisan warfare is the opposite of Schmitt's
absolute war in which the enemy is "a monster that must not only be
defeated but also utterly destroyed."21 Rather, the intensity of such
enmity, which is based on existential difference,22 is replaced with
constantly changing fields of opportunities and temporary and relative
friend--enemy relations.

Schmitt's [reflections]{.underline} on the modern partisan [still used
**superpowers** and **superior military strength**]{.underline}
(ultimately [based on the possession of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}) [as **decisive coordinates**]{.underline}. [The
techno-partisan is]{.underline} either [**reduced** to a]{.underline}
"transportable and exchangeable [**tool** of]{.underline} a powerful
central agency of world [politics]{.underline}" that deploys or
deactivates him "as the situation demands;"23 or, as
"technical-industrial partisan,"24 he is "motorized, and linked to an
information network with secret transmitters and radar gadgetry;"25 or,
in a postnuclear war scenario, he becomes "a new type of partisan"
practicing a new type of "land-appropriation;"26 or, finally, he morphs
into a "cosmopartisan,"27 who is nevertheless still deployed in the
interest of a [power's rule]{.underline} over the planet. Schmitt [does
not consider the possibility of the partisan logic becoming **total**
and **infiltrating any institutional framework**]{.underline} that might
act as a katechon [so that]{.underline} what he calls "transitional,
intermediate arrangements between total war and peace"28---**[smoldering
forms of warfare]{.underline}**, as it were---[become
**self-sustaining**]{.underline}. Tomorrow's techno-economic partisan
will blend in with the new means and become part of a man--machine
assemblage. As an agent, he will always already be a double agent.
Within the interconnected networks of exchange, he will be both user and
producer of fleeting, metastable configurations. On this a priori
micro-foundation, [we may visualize macro forms of war]{.underline} as
the intersections [between **warlords**]{.underline}, regular
**[entrepreneurs]{.underline}**, [**governments** and
**ministries**]{.underline}, [the **global formal** and **informal
economy**]{.underline}, **[ethnic/cultural/religious
groups]{.underline}**, [and **international criminal
organizations**]{.underline}. These forms stand in shifting relations of
family resemblance, and by definition [no list of them will **ever** be
exhaustive]{.underline}, [as the shifting **never ends**]{.underline}.
The elements that make up the macro forms---such as states and
corporations---provide temporary framework conditions, but they are not
sovereign providers. Rather, they temporarily coordinate individual
micro-level events while the overall process drifts toward contingency,
driven not by actors but by reactors.

## Blocks

### AT: Academia Fails

#### The alt's [cooperative re-imagination]{.underline} of communication and value can [redefine the subjectivity of society]{.underline}. The academy is key---if we win a link, it proves that we've identified a [crack in the system]{.underline} from which new relationalities can emerge.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 130-132, dml)

[The proletarianization of the University is predicated
upon]{.underline} atomized competition, which utilizes new forces of
production to reshape relations between people, in order to extract
value. A critical element of this is **[enforced
separation]{.underline}** between individuals, and the ability for
individual agency to be repurposed by structural requirements.
[However]{.underline}, in order [to extract maximum value]{.underline},
[capital requires individuals]{.underline} to work in concert, or [to
**collaborate**]{.underline} as producers, distributors and consumers.
[This gives opportunities for **cooperative
re-imagination**]{.underline}. For Marx (1866), the cooperative movement
was a transformational force where it understood its relationship to
labour as the point of social production. Thus, he argued that producer
cooperatives, as opposed to consumer cooperatives, are a manifestation
of class antagonism that can point towards 'the republican and
beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers'
(ibid., emphasis in the original). This analysis of cooperation rests on
forms of self-mediation by human beings of their material activities in
society. In an idealized cooperative state, [activities are **no longer
piecemeal** or **solitary**]{.underline}, [or governed by
capital]{.underline}; rather, [they are governed by **alternative
networks** of solidarity and purpose]{.underline}: 'This is not possible
without the community. Only within the community has each individual the
means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; hence personal freedom
becomes possible only within the community' (Marx & Engels 1998: 86).

A focus on the communal and associational characteristics of cooperation
is critical to Marx's praxis, because in them he sees the individual
developing the capabilities of their species (Marx 2004). As a result,
[a **refocusing** upon cooperative values and principles]{.underline},
grounded in the conceptual framework of the self-in-association, [acts
as a moment of **refusal** of alienated socialization]{.underline}, in
which the producers of society are estranged from both the means and
conditions of production of that society. However, discontent at the
present state of things does not coalesce into a single,
counter-hegemonic position, predicated upon a unified collection of
alternative governing principles for life. [It]{.underline} therefore
[becomes **important** to think about **alternative forms** of knowledge
production and an integration with alternative conceptions of
**mutuality**]{.underline}, [**solidarity** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those emerging [from
indigenous or marginalized communities]{.underline}.

Indigenous methodologies or modes of being help both to develop a fresh
focus on knowledge and to reframe the idea of movement towards a more
humane social production as a liminal process, engaging the body,
emotions and cognition (Tuhiwai Smith, Tuck & Yang 2018). In this
sensuous, epistemic opening, knowledge is rooted in people, place,
philosophy, values, communities, axiologies and cosmologies, which
generate 'relational accountability' (Wilson 2008: 77). Such
accountability is mutual, respectful and dignified, and acts as a
beginning for refusing the domination of knowledge from the global North
imposed as progressive and rooted in an ideological, evidence-based
epistemological standard. Here, [cooperative techniques for social
reproduction might enable forms of **relational
accountability**]{.underline} between peoples and places. Moreover, in
this process, [they offer the possibility of **liberating material
forces**]{.underline}, [including technology]{.underline}, [and
connecting them to alternative conceptions of the world]{.underline}, in
order [to **widen autonomy** and **freedom**]{.underline}.

For Marx (1866; 1970) [a cooperative revolution in the governance of
technology forms a **crucial strand** in changing the general conditions
of social production]{.underline}, [because it **redefines the
subjectivity of society** towards humanity and **away** from the
commodity and the valorization of capital]{.underline}. If we are to do
this, then [a **shared**]{.underline}, [**associational expression** of
individual lives is **required**]{.underline}, in order [to realize the
**essence** of what it means to be human]{.underline}. Marx's idea was
that [the expression of my life and those of my peers are **immanent**
to each other]{.underline}, [and should be mediated **directly** rather
than through the **market**]{.underline}, private property, the division
of labour and commodity exchange. [This requires an **alternative
conception** of how to integrate the forces of production into our
communal being]{.underline}, [and a **liberatory conception** of how
those forces are **subordinate** to our essence and our social
relations]{.underline} (Bookchin 2005). Beautifully, Marx (1844) argues
that [through such practices]{.underline} '[our products would be like
**so many mirrors**]{.underline}, [out of which our essence
**shone**]{.underline}' [as a]{.underline} '**[free
expression]{.underline}**' [of our lives]{.underline}.

[At issue is how to find **cracks** in the system of
capital]{.underline}, [into which technologies for
**alternative**]{.underline}, [**liberatory conceptions** of society can
be **inserted**]{.underline}. Dunayevskaya (1958) has argued that these
need to be situated inside organizations that are beyond
value-production, or they risk degenerating under competition. As a
result, a re-imagination of the University has to engage with more than
the cooperative possibilities of the collective ecosystems currently
structured to reproduce value. [A re-imagination of the potential for
forces of production to **enable social connection** and **knowledge
sharing**]{.underline}, and to liberate time for autonomous activity
rather than the imposition of commodity production, comes up against
structural contradictions. Thus, a re-imagination of technology as a
means for liberating knowledge for a new society [demands]{.underline} a
new material literacy as [a **radical**]{.underline}, **[pedagogical
project]{.underline}** at the level of society.

This is a transitional project [that critiques the place of technology
as it is **currently instantiated** inside the University]{.underline}.
[It critiques the relationship of the digital University]{.underline},
[and its techniques of governance]{.underline}, to knowledge production
and the generation of social wealth. It also critiques these
relationships and techniques [in terms of their ability to **enable
humanity** to engage with **global economic** and **environmental
crises**]{.underline}. [It critiques the **limitations** in our
collective ability to **produce knowledge** inside the University to
engage with these crises]{.underline}, in part [through the separation
of **polity** and **economy**]{.underline}, [such that the latter
**dominates** the former]{.underline}. It critiques these limitations as
they are reproduced inside organizations conditioned by the State to
generate value through exploitation and expropriation. In this way, [it
moves **beyond** the fetishization of technologies and
techniques]{.underline}, including the ways in which these are
reproduced and enclosed inside institutions like universities (see
Ampuja, Chapter 2, in this volume). [The potential for relational
accountability and]{.underline} the [recomposition]{.underline} of
peoples, places and technologies [offer an **alternative set of
possibilities** for intellectual work beyond the capitalized
University]{.underline}.

techno-utopics of a world in which all of those who are already human
and already subjects ascend into the realm of those whose lives are

service]{.underline} (whether in factories, in the military, or in the
nursing home), [then how do we think about the relationship of new
technologies to possible fields of political protest or
action?]{.underline}

[The dissident technological [imaginaries we

### AT: Consequentialism

#### You should prioritize comparing the [ethical consequences]{.underline} of our [models of thought]{.underline} over comparing [causal predictions]{.underline} based on [anachronistic models]{.underline} of the political.

**Gray and Eloff, 22**---School of Philosophy at North-West University
(Chantelle and Aragorn, "Fabulation in a Time of Algorithmic Ecology:
Making the Future Possible Again," *Technology, Urban Space and the
Networked Community*, Chapter 5, 105-133, SpringerLink, dml)

In his 2008 article, "The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the
Scientific Method Obsolete", Wired editor Chris Anderson notoriously
argues that [the era of]{.underline} the scientific method built around
[**testable hypotheses** is]{.underline} fast-becoming
**[obsolete]{.underline}** due to the advent of "petabyte-scale" data
accumulation and analytics. Observing that tech companies like Google
treat this "massive corpus as a laboratory of the human condition"
(Anderson 2008), Anderson polemically implores us to **[forget every
theory of human behaviour]{.underline}**, [from **linguistics** and
**sociology** to **ontology** and **psychology**]{.underline}. "With
enough data", he avers, "the numbers speak for themselves" (ibid.), and
[statistical correlation renders superfluous **any theorisation of
causality**]{.underline}. The Californian Ideology (Barbrook and Cameron
1996)1 implicit in this overstatement of the benefits of data-driven
research has been challenged by several commentators (see, e.g.,
Pigliucci 2009 and Mazzocchi 2015) and is patently specious. [The
appeal]{.underline} made by Silicon Valley zealots [to]{.underline}
'**[pay no attention to the man behind the curtain]{.underline}**'
[relies on a **mythical**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} sometimes even
**[eschatologically feverish]{.underline}**, [conception of science as a
**purely objective** pursuit]{.underline}, [as well as a **facile
conception** of human]{.underline} thought and behaviour---indeed,
[subjectivity]{.underline}---[wherein we can be **comprehensively
understood** via]{.underline} the [purely quantitative
approaches]{.underline} of Big Data analyses [and]{.underline} the
[statistical aggregation]{.underline} of deep learning systems. As
Louise Amoore underscores in Cloud Ethics, [this ideology confronts
our]{.underline} "[fallible]{.underline}, [intractable]{.underline},
[fraught political world with]{.underline} a curious kind of
**[infallibility]{.underline}**. In the cloud, [the promise is that
everything can be rendered **tractable**]{.underline}, [all political
difficulty and uncertainty nonetheless **actionable**]{.underline}"
(Amoore 2020, 55). This dream of complete mathematical and technological
control over reality---of "a kind of atlas of clouds for the ineffable,
a condensed trace of the trajectories of our future lives with one
another" (ibid.)---is hardly new. What legal theorist Antoinette Rouvroy
refers to as "algorithmic governmentality"2 (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016,
6), by which she means "the increasingly statistical governance of the
'real' ensuing from a convergence of contemporary technological and
socio-political evolutions" (Rouvroy 2011, 119), can be traced at least
as far back as first-order cybernetics (Wiener 1965, 12) and, before
that, to Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator (cf. Couturat 1901). [What
makes the contemporary problem novel]{.underline}, however, [is that the
latest technologies]{.underline}, for example cloud computing,
practically unlimited data storage, high-speed global communications
networks and, most importantly, machine learning---and here we mean
specifically new forms of connectionist 'artificial intelligence' that,
unlike older symbolic AI models, rely on multi-layer artificial neural
networks that are assumed to represent the biology of human cognitive
structure---[have **powerfully exacerbated** the quest for]{.underline}
([and assumptions of]{.underline}) '**[Algorithmic
Supremacy]{.underline}**'. As digital technology theorist Dan McQuillan
argues, data-driven modelling via statistical induction is assumed to
bear inherent significance, but this approach, which McQuillan describes
as a form of "machinic Neoplatonism" (McQuillan 2018), tends to entirely
elide the broader subjective and inter-subjective contexts within which
analyses and modelling unfold [and is thus]{.underline}, via this
unwarranted delimitation, [able to present itself as operating with a
level of mathematical objectivity it **simply does not
possess**]{.underline}.

This creates several insidious problems. For one, as Bernard Steigler
observes in The Age of Disruption, [this deferral to]{.underline} the
'superiority' of [algorithmic reason legitimises]{.underline} "the
**[systematic exploitation]{.underline}** and physical reticulation of
interindividual and transindividual relations" in the service of the
data economy (Stiegler 2019, 7). In other words, [the]{.underline} kinds
of transgenerational, intergenerational, interpersonal, personal and
even pre-personal3 [circuits that used to]{.underline} "[emerge through
**affective relations**]{.underline} of various kinds" over time within
and across societies [to forge]{.underline} "**[dreams]{.underline}**,
**[goals]{.underline}**, [**objectives** and **common
horizons**]{.underline}" [have been **disrupted** in unprecedented
ways]{.underline} (ibid., 16). Rouvroy argues, in fact, that
[subjectivity is **bypassed** by contemporary digital automisation so
that subjects are rendered **little more** than a]{.underline}
"[collection of]{.underline} infraindividual **[data]{.underline}**"
that are "recomposed at a supra-individual level under the form of
profile" (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016, 12). Second, the speed at which
what we have elsewhere termed the Algocene4 has emerged, as well as [the
level of **technological literacy** a coherent understanding of this
shift entails]{.underline}, [has **far exceeded** our capacity to
theorise its effects]{.underline}, with the result that [many
analyses]{.underline} of our contemporary condition [remain **trapped in
anachronism**]{.underline}, [projecting the image of an **old world**
and its struggles onto a **new**]{.underline} and largely **[alien
terrain]{.underline}**. It is perhaps not too hyperbolic to claim, as
many have, that the staggering technological shifts of the last 20-odd
years necessitate theoretical engagement on the scale of a new
geological era or epoch. [This is **no longer** the world of
**industrial capitalism**]{.underline}, nor even of Foucault's
disciplinary societies (Foucault 1977), Deleuze's control societies
(Deleuze 1992) or Guattari's Integrated World Capitalism (Guattari
2000), although these are all vestigially inflected in the new
situation, which has variously, although far from exhaustively, been
termed societies of hyper-control and computational capitalism (Stiegler
2019), cognitive capitalism (Yann Moulier-Boutang 2012), platform
capitalism (Srnicek 2016), the age of planetary computerisation
(Guattari 2013), The Stack (Bratton 2015), infopolitics (Koopman 2018),
instrumentarianism (Zuboff 2019) and algorithmic governmentality
(Rouvroy and Berns 2013). Third, because of the speed at which digital
innovation operates, whatever effects this new "hyper-synchronization of
consciousness" (Vignola 2017, 188) is having on subjectivity can only be
perceived in the most miniscule of ways, yet we have to rely on this
minimum of information for a symptomatology because, if we follow
Deleuze via Nietzsche, it is only through a symptomatology that we can
trace etiological factors in order to find the most inventive corrective
therapy. A difficult task indeed considering the constraints we are
outlining here! The point is, we urgently require new tools to grapple
with the implications of the encroachment of algorithmic reason and
governmentality into more and more aspects of our lives and minds. Far
from eschewing theory in favour of the transcendent mathesis universalis
of our new digital overlords, situated thinking about our times has
never been more crucial. If, however, this kind of thinking has not been
forthcoming to the extent we would hope for, then this too perhaps forms
part of the symptomatology of the Algocene. In describing something that
is unprecedented, [we need to take care]{.underline}, as McKenzie Wark
argues, [to find]{.underline} "[a renewed language for **describing**
the present situation and **identifying** what in the received
language]{.underline} of capitalism \[or, for those further behind the
times, Marxism\] [**impedes** forward movement]{.underline} in thought
and action" (Wark 2019, 6). Having said this, we also hold [that it is
important **not** to reduce the entire social field to algorithmic
control]{.underline}, despite its near-ubiquity. [What is]{.underline}
rather [**vital** is to understand what this new way of experiencing
subjectivity **produces** and what]{.underline}, in turn, **[produces
it]{.underline}**. As Guattari explains of the Freudian Unconscious, it
produced new desires, which included "hysteria, infantile neurosis,
psychosis, family conflict, the reading of myths, etc." (Guattari 1995,
10). So too what Stiegler refers to as "negative collective protention",
or the nihilistic expectation of nothing, except perhaps The End
(Stiegler 2019, 19, 50), has produced new desires, and here [we have to
seriously consider that **The End**]{.underline} might in
fact---probably [is]{.underline}---**[desired]{.underline}**, even
**[collectively]{.underline}** so (especially given that we also face
Anthropogenic doom).5

[How]{.underline}, then, [do we **change** this desire]{.underline}?
[How do we use the **diagnostic tools** at our disposal]{.underline} in
the schizoanalytic mode---that is, a therapeutic mode---[to produce
something **new**]{.underline}, something healthier? [How do we change
our **practices** and **ways of being**]{.underline} in the world [so
that **life**]{.underline}---[rather than]{.underline} a misguided idea
of **[Algorithmic Supremacy]{.underline}**---**[matters]{.underline}**
again? In this chapter, we attempt to give a broad symptomatology of
algorithmic subjectivity, drawing on a range of scholars who have gone
before us. [Our aim]{.underline}, diverging from most theorists,
however, is **[not to propose legal]{.underline}** or other
**[reforms]{.underline}**. [We understand the algorithm to already
present itself as an **ethicopolitical arrangement** of
values]{.underline}, [assumptions and propositions about the
world]{.underline}. [Our question]{.underline}---yes, our desire---[is
**not**]{.underline}: [How **ought** the algorithm be arranged for a
good society?]{.underline} [but rather]{.underline}: [What **is** a good
society?]{.underline} For [it is from the **latter**]{.underline}
question, we hold, [that **healthier algorithmic arrangements** will
flow]{.underline}, **[not the other way around]{.underline}**.

As algorithmic forms of intelligence grow in parallel to (and often in
alliance with) genetic research, [the integration of
algorithms]{.underline} and big-data analysis in the biological sphere
[brings with it a greater belief in **techno-positivism**]{.underline}.
[More and more]{.underline}, [statistical thought]{.underline}, regimes
of assessment of the natural world, [modes of prediction]{.underline},
[and analysis treat matter and life itself as **finite** and
**computable objects**]{.underline}. [The idea that life might be an
open]{.underline}, [nonlinear]{.underline}, [and exponentially chaotic
system is **increasingly behind us**]{.underline}. We seem to have
reached a point where [the market is reimagined as the **primary
mechanism** for the validation of truth]{.underline}. Since markets
themselves are increasingly turning into algorithmic structures, the
only useful knowledge today is supposed to be algorithmic. [Instead of
**actual human beings** with body]{.underline}, [history]{.underline},
[and flesh]{.underline}, [big data and statistical inferences are **all
that count**]{.underline}, and both are mostly derived from computation.

Through big data in particular, [surveillance is expanded into the
**emotional registers** of domestic and embodied
experience]{.underline}. As Kirstie Ball and William Webster (2020) have
argued, a nexus of the potential of analysts, the data practices
themselves, and the newly configured intimate spheres is increasingly
drawn into the commercial value chain (Ball and Webster 2020). Data
extraction is itself a political economic regime driven by the perpetual
cycle of capital accumulation (Sadowski 2020).

For Matteo Pasquinelli (2015), algorithmic reason is a form of
rationality whose end is the understanding of vast amounts of data
according to a specific vector, the recording of emerging properties,
and the forecasting of tendencies. To some extent, the metadata society
is characterized by the "accumulation of information about information."
[Algorithms also mine metadata for the purpose of establishing patterns
of behavior]{.underline}, [detecting anomalies]{.underline}, [and
recognizing an enemy]{.underline}. The enemy is constructed as a reality
via statistics, modeling, and mathematics. [Power]{.underline}, thus,
[is increasingly about **identifying patterns**]{.underline} or
connections [in]{.underline} random [data]{.underline}, in a context in
which the opposition between information and knowledge, knowledge and
data, data and image, and thinking and seeing appears to collapse.

[Power]{.underline}, [detection]{.underline}, [and surveillance are
**nevertheless not all**]{.underline}. [Algorithms are interwoven with a
**multiplicity** of relations]{.underline} and heterogeneous things, be
they data, bodies, or objects (Amoore 2020). In this sense, [they
are]{.underline} in themselves [a **negotiated process**]{.underline}.
Their power derives from their capacity to dynamically combine and
recombine them and in so doing to reconfigure different social and
material heterogeneities (Burke 2019; Lee and Björklund Larsen 2017).
[**How** they fold and unfold these relations]{.underline}, [and with
**what effects**]{.underline}, [is]{.underline} an
**[open-ended]{.underline}** matter.

Computational and [algorithmic logic is now found at the **very source
of general perception**]{.underline}. As a result of the conflation of
knowledge, computation, and markets, contempt has been extended to
anyone who has nothing to sell and nothing to buy, or anything that
cannot be bought and sold. [It is **therefore correct to argue** that
there is a **shifting distribution of powers** between the **human** and
the **technological**]{.underline}, in the sense that [technologies are
moving toward]{.underline} "**[general intelligence]{.underline}**" [and
**self-replication**]{.underline}. [They are being granted the powers of
**reproduction** and **independent**]{.underline} teleonomic
**[purpose]{.underline}** rather than having them taken away.

Key to life futures is therefore the extent to which [technological
escalation has **redefined** the nature of speed]{.underline},
[unshackled markets]{.underline}, [and the economy]{.underline}.
Important, too, are the ways in which [various technological devices
**constantly monitor** our behavior in attempts to reveal how it could
be **modified** and **optimized**]{.underline}. As a matter of fact,
[some of the **fastest-expanding markets** in the world today
are]{.underline} "[markets for **future behavior**]{.underline}." They
rely on better understanding incipient future intent. This could be
future voting intentions. It could also be the intent to commit fraud,
the intent to buy life insurance, or the intent to stream a specific
video (Amoore 2019). [These markets also rely on the extraction and
mining of new forms of raw material]{.underline}. Such raw material
mostly consists of [**information** and **details** about individuals'
behavior]{.underline} taken, as Zuboff (2019) writes, from the distant
corners of our unconscious. It is raw material [plumbed from **intimate
patterns** of the self]{.underline}---our personality, our moods, our
emotions, our lies, our vulnerabilities, every level of our intimacy
(Zuboff 2019; Illouz 2007). [The purpose is]{.underline} not only to
heighten the predictability of our behavior. It is also [to make **life
itself** amenable to datafication]{.underline}.

[A **key feature** of our times is]{.underline} therefore [the extent to
which **all** societies are organized according to the **same
principle**]{.underline}---[the **computational**]{.underline}. [We are
**surrounded** by ubiquitous computing]{.underline}, [technologies that
weave themselves into the fabric of our everyday lives]{.underline};
these devices, sensors, and other things we interact with have become
part of our presence in the world all the time. How the boundary between
us and these devices is enacted is a matter of open debate (Matzner
2019).

But what is the computational? The computational is generally understood
as a technical system whose function is to capture, extract, and
automatically process data that must be identified, selected, sorted,
classified, recombined, codified, and activated. Yet we shouldn\'t
forget that the computational is also a force and energy of a special
kind, a speed regime with its own qualities and infrastructures. It
produces and serializes subjects, objects, and phenomena; splits reason
from consciousness and memory; and codes and stores data that can be
used to manufacture new types of services and devices sold for profit.

Whether operating on bodies, nerves, material, blood, cellular tissues,
the brain, or energy, [the aim is]{.underline} the same: [the conversion
of all substances into **quantities**]{.underline}; [the conversion of
organic and vital ends into **technical means**]{.underline}; [the
**capture** of forces and possibilities]{.underline}, [and their
**annexation** by the language of a machine-brain transformed into an
**autonomous** and **automated system**]{.underline} (Friederich 2020;
Perény 2013). The computational is also the institution through which a
common world, a new common sense, and new configurations of power,
perception, and reality are nowadays brought into being. [The
**globalization** of corporate sovereignty]{.underline}, [the extension
of capital into **every sphere of life**]{.underline}, [and
**technological escalation** in the form of the computational are
all]{.underline} part of one and [the **same process**]{.underline}.

#### We [link turn]{.underline} this. Cybernetics is [not]{.underline} a [totality]{.underline}, but it's [trying to become one]{.underline}, and that's happening [faster]{.underline} and [more pervasively]{.underline} than we realize. Highlighting algorithmic violence can expose [cracks]{.underline} in the system, but the aff and perm [pave those cracks over]{.underline}!

**Bellanova, et al, 21**---Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of
Amsterdam (Rocco, with Kristina Irion, Katja Lindskov Jacobsen,
Francesco Ragazzi, Rune Saugmann, and Lucy Suchman, "Toward a Critique
of Algorithmic Violence," International Political Sociology (2021) 15,
121--150, dml)

This collective discussion shows that [it is vital to attend to the
**multiplicity** and **ambiguity** of algorithmic violence]{.underline},
[as well as to the effects of **seemingly innocent
necessities**]{.underline} like the fixation of the past into fact/data
as necessary to fix the social for computational treatment, and thus to
enable such computation to make the future actionable, something
security can intervene in. When thinking about more conventional, often
largely pre-digital, forms of violence, as the subject of much
international relations scholarship, it is increasingly important to add
a note on algorithmic violence in the analysis. [Doing so is necessary
in order **not to lose sight** of practices that are **not violent** in
a **more traditional sense**]{.underline} (see also Amoore and de Goede
2014). This is an empirical point (e.g., about blind spots vis-à-vis
instances of algorithmic violence), as well as a methodological argument
(e.g., about translation processes at play in the use of
computer/machine vision and hence about the value of moving beyond text
when analyzing algorithmic violence), [and]{.underline} a normative
sensitivity (e.g., about [**invisibilized forms** of algorithmic
violence **not being held to account**]{.underline}). Indeed, the
invisibility of many algorithmically supported infrastructures poses
numerous challenges, including accountability and governance challenges,
hence the importance of thinking differently about the issue of
algorithmic violence. [Attention **must be paid** to an algorithmic
system's **genesis**]{.underline} in terms of data provenance,
geography, culture, time and space, resources, and actors involved for
its governance. This is particularly crucial for issues arising from the
transnational deployment of algorithmic systems for the protection of
human rights and other domestic forms of redress against algorithmic
violence.

[In the **security domain**]{.underline}, [violence is often implied in
the **very making** of the data infrastructures needed for algorithms to
work]{.underline}. [Violence]{.underline} thus [starts **before**
algorithms produce profiles or provide targeting
information]{.underline}. [Semiotic violence can also happen when
**datasets move** from one practice to another]{.underline}, [crossing
not only **geopolitical borders** but also **sociopolitical settings**
and **temporal boundaries**]{.underline}, for example, [between
**civilian** and **military practices**]{.underline}. Accordingly, we
need to attend to questions of algorithmic violence happening not only
in the initial moments of datafication and data collection, but also
when datasets become (in)security data. [Focusing on data
infrastructures and their making in diverse security contexts can help
**resituating** algorithms as part of **complex** and **messy
practices**]{.underline}, [and thus avoid **disembodying**
them]{.underline} ([which would end up cautioning the **same
frictionless discourse that promotes algorithmic
governance**]{.underline}). [It may offer]{.underline} IPS-inspired
[research a way to grasp the force of computation **in media
res**]{.underline}, that is, [studying how algorithms **affect** and are
**shaped** by other things]{.underline} (see also Chun 2011, 177). [This
means]{.underline} no clear-cut foundational ground on which critique
can be built and leveraged once and for all, but rather [a **continuous
work** of attention and intervention]{.underline}.

### AT: Law Good---AI

#### AI has turned international law into [Swiss cheese]{.underline}. Regulation [fails when it counts]{.underline}, even if it's not [completely]{.underline} toothless.

**Maas, 19**---PhD Fellow, Centre for International Law, Conflict and
Crisis, University of Copenhagen (Maathijs, "International Law Does Not
Compute: Artificial Intelligence and the Development, Displacement or
Destruction of the Global Legal Order," Melbourne Journal of
International Law 20, no. 1 (July 2019): 29-57, dml)

In addition to these general factors of technological change and
features specific to general \'transformational\' technologies, there
are [features specific to AI technology]{.underline} that further
[**complicate** its effective regulation under
international]{.underline} (and national) [law]{.underline}. As Scherer
has argued, [AI research and development processes are distinguished by
problematic features]{.underline}, namely, that [it is]{.underline}
**[\'Discreet]{.underline}**, **[Diffuse]{.underline}**,
**[Discrete]{.underline}**, [and **Opaque**]{.underline}\'. 12 8 It will
be useful to take these in turn.

First, [AI development is often **discreet**]{.underline}, [as **little
physical infrastructure** is required]{.underline}. AI projects can be
developed without the mass institutional frameworks that were necessary
for building industrial capacity in the last century, and without the
signature ingredients such as uranium or certain chemical agents
necessary for building strategically pivotal weapons of mass
destruction. Of course, this difference should not be overstated:
[cutting-edge AI research and applications still require large amounts
of computational power]{.underline} or hardware. 129 For instance,
recent years have seen extremely large increases in the level of compute
used in the top AI training runs an exponential increase with a three
and a half month doubling time (compared to an 18-month doubling time
for Moore\'s Law), 130 resulting in a staggering 300,000-time increase
between 2012 and 2018.131 On the other hand, [the amount]{.underline} of
compute [necessary]{.underline} for deploying already-trained systems
[is **far lower**]{.underline} than that used in the training; [**not
all** competitive or useful AI capabilities will come with such
prohibitively restrictive hardware requirements]{.underline}; 132 [the
cost of computing continues to **steadily fall**]{.underline};
[and]{.underline}, at any rate, [the **sheer ubiquity** of computing
hardware]{.underline} in modern society, and its dual-use nature,
[renders it **far more difficult** to restrict]{.underline}. 133

Secondly, [AI development is **discrete**]{.underline}, [as separate
components may be designed in a **decentralised manner**]{.underline},
[without top-down coordination]{.underline}, with the full potential not
becoming apparent until they are brought together in a new application
although this may not be the case for certain (especially military) AI
applications. 134

Thirdly, [AI development is **diffuse**]{.underline}, [as software
development can be **geographically** and **organisationally dispersed**
and may involve actors in **diverse** and **potentially unknown
jurisdictions**]{.underline} as is often the case with open-source
software. 135

Fourthly, [AI development is **opaque**]{.underline}, [as the
technologies are **not well understood** by regulators]{.underline},
[and outsiders or inspectors **cannot reliably detect** features in an
AI system under development]{.underline}. 136 One can also compare the
socalled \'Volkswagen problem\'; a 2015 scandal involving the reveal of
\'defeat device\' algorithms in Volkswagen on-board vehicle computers.
These [algorithms]{.underline} detected when a car was undergoing
official tests and accordingly altered the engine\'s nitrogen oxide
emissions [to **feign compliance**]{.underline} with environmental
standards. 137 Similar modules [could be installed in military or
cyberwarfare AI systems]{.underline}, [rendering effective and credible
verification]{.underline} of arms control treaties
**[precarious]{.underline}**.

Moreover, [AI regulation is **complicated** by the difficulty of
**fixing a single definition** of what AI actually is]{.underline}. 1 3
8 [The **opacity** of AI systems]{.underline}, [their **heterogeneity**
in architectures and the **deniability** of their use in certain
contexts]{.underline} (eg, cyberwar) [may **impede** the formation
of]{.underline} customary [international law]{.underline} on these uses,
in a similar way as has been observed (or rather has not been observed)
with \'conventional\' cyber weapons or intelligence operations. 139

In contrast, [relying on treaties or negotiations **may not
suffice**]{.underline} either, [since at a political level]{.underline},
[AI technology is set to be **particularly contested**]{.underline}.
Picker has noted that one recurring challenge to international law
involves \'**[unevenly shared technology]{.underline}**\'.140 This
[creates both **epistemic** problems]{.underline} ([not all states have
the **requisite technological know-how** to understand what regulation
is needed]{.underline}, [or even to appreciate that it is
needed]{.underline}) [as well as **political** problems]{.underline}
([states can have **different stakes** and **interests**]{.underline}).
141 As it is, leading AI systems are set to be developed by or within a
relatively small subset of states; the extent to which it can
proliferate further is unclear and may sensitively depend on the degree
to which performance is differentially determined and constrained by
hardware or software. 142 [The **sheer range** of AI applications
renders it **hard** for states party to come to an agreement on the
risks]{.underline} of a strategically appealing technology, if that
technology does not have a clear \'type specimen\' application, or if
certain capabilities are hidden.

Moreover, [software has features that have]{.underline}, at least in
some cases, [made it **resistant** to regulation]{.underline}. It has
been argued, for instance, that [traditional arms control regimes **have
not been successful** in]{.underline} the realm of [cyberspace because
of several different strategic features]{.underline} of the technologies
in question. 143 As also noted by Paul Scharre, historical
non-proliferation or arms control [efforts have seen the greatest
success when they sought to **completely outlaw** a weapon]{.underline},
[rather than set up **complicated rules**]{.underline} about how such
systems may and may not be used. 144 This echoes Thomas Schelling\'s
observation that

[the **most powerful** limitations]{.underline}, [the **most appealing**
ones]{.underline}, [the ones **most likely** to be
observable]{.underline} in wartime, are those that [have a
**conspicuousness** and **simplicity**]{.underline}, that are
qualitative and not a matter of degree, that [provide **recognizable
boundaries**]{.underline}. 145

[Digital]{.underline} or virtual [technologies]{.underline}, which are
not a single \'technology\', **[do not lend themselves]{.underline}** so
naturally [to the articulation of such a **simple**]{.underline},
[**discrete** or **complete ban**]{.underline}.

Likewise, the various non-proliferation and arms control regimes for
nuclear weapons were able to invoke unambiguous red lines an outright
ban on military development or use against horizontal proliferation.
Simultaneously, they were able to utilise measurable, objective
benchmarks for restraining vertical proliferation, in the form of
clearly quantified and comparable caps on any of a range of metrics,
such as the number of deployed missiles, the maximum number of warheads
mountable on each missile, or their total throwweight or yield. 146 By
contrast, it is difficult to measure the relative strength of states in
cyberspace or with AI systems. 147 Moreover, as with cyber weapons,
there may be uncertainty regarding the efficacy of military AI
technology, challenges with monitoring compliance and difficulties with
enforcement. 148

We can now sum up the \'soft\' argument for legal destruction. [Even
though international law is **in principle** capable of the developments
necessary to fix the legal problems created by AI systems]{.underline},
149 **[in practice]{.underline}**, [these systems will likely prove
**highly resistant**]{.underline} to the sources and tools available to
international law. [Customary international law is **slow** and requires
**clear evidence** of state practice]{.underline} ([which is **not
present** with]{.underline} \'**[hidden]{.underline}**\'
[capabilities]{.underline} such as cyberwarfare AIs, [or which is
hindered by **definitional problems**]{.underline} around AI). [Treaties
usually require that both states party have **roughly even stakes** in
the technology]{.underline}, [**clear expectations** of
benefit]{.underline} for abiding by the treaty, [the ability to
**jointly agree** on clear definitions and]{.underline} the ability to
**[effectively verify compliance]{.underline}** ([all of which are
**difficult** in the context of AI development]{.underline}). Finally,
[international courts are often **slow**]{.underline}, [**reactive** to
specific cases and **non-expert** on technologies]{.underline}.
[Effective international law regimes on new]{.underline}, emerging
[technology have historically relied on]{.underline} a range of
ingredients, including [an ability to **anticipate** and
**agree**]{.underline}, to some extent, [on the path and applications of
development]{.underline}, an ability to agree on
**[definitions]{.underline}** of the technology [and the ability to
**effectively verify compliance**]{.underline}. Many or all of
[these]{.underline} ingredients [**will not apply** in the context
of]{.underline} many [AI]{.underline} systems, suggesting that this
technology will lead to disruption of that order.

[This may not inhibit international law from carrying out]{.underline}
legal [developments to resolve **all** situations of legal
uncertainty]{.underline}, 150 [but **it may do so in some key
cases**]{.underline} (eg, **[arms control of destabilising AI
systems]{.underline}**), 151 [and such situations may leave
**semi-permanent**]{.underline} \'**[holes]{.underline}**\' [in
international law]{.underline}. [While perhaps not an **existential
threat** to international law]{.underline}, [such holes are likely to
**impede effective governance** and **undercut the legitimacy** of the
global legal order]{.underline} in the eyes of the public.

### AT: Law Good---Generic/Cyber

#### Their offense is [idealistic]{.underline} and [outdated]{.underline}. The law's ability to influence society has been [completely displaced]{.underline} by code.

**Jiménez, 22**---Melbourne Law School, The University of Melbourne
(Aitor, "Law, Code and Exploitation: How Corporations Regulate the
Working Conditions of the Digital Proletariat," Critical Sociology,
2022, Vol. 48(2) 361--373, dml)

The discussions around the resemblance between law and code are as old
as code. After all, [law is a normative language intended to **shape
conducts**]{.underline}, [**frame behaviours** and **structure
reality**]{.underline}. In short, it is a system of rules regulating
actions. [And code is the **same**]{.underline}, [a system to **program
instructions**]{.underline}. A language that executes. Both are a system
of symbols that, when activated, put in motion, stop, create or destroy
something (Lessig, 2006). However, as Lessig's works show, [the
relationship between law and code has **fundamentally
changed**]{.underline}. [Before the digital revolution]{.underline},
[law was **undisputedly ruling** the]{.underline} '**[real
world]{.underline}**', while code was structuring the so-called
cyberspace. [But]{.underline} then the digital revolution occurred and
[digital technologies became **ubiquitous** and **increasingly
embroiled** with law]{.underline}. The rise of the internet -- with its
libertarian dreams of free will with no laws -- gave rise to the rule of
digital monopolies, who ruled and legislated like tyrants in
'cyberspace' (Hassan and Filippi, 2017). However, [cyberspace is **not**
a place of **fantasy**]{.underline}. [It is **imbricated with
reality**]{.underline}. The digital economy is neither based on the
material nor the cyberworld, but on a 'cyber-physical infrastructure'
(Jacob, 2017), composed by programmes, software and the network, of
course -- but also data centres, investors, workers, minerals, cables
and every possibly thing that can be perceived through senses.

In a vulgarised version of Marxism popularised under the Stalinist
regime, law was considered as a simple product of the economic forces in
motion (Vyshinsky, 1948). They drew on Marx's hierarchical distinction
of the economic base and the legal and political superstructure arising
on it (1979). [With the becoming of code as a **fundamental** mean of
production of the digital era]{.underline}, [the positioning of law as
an element solely circumscribed to the superstructure has
been]{.underline} seriously, if not definitely,
**[demolished]{.underline}**. As Lessig announced, [code and law not
only **share common grounds**]{.underline}, indeed [they have become
**undistinguishable**]{.underline}. Hence, paraphrasing Pistor (2019),
the 'code of capital' is present in today's digital factories, not as an
outside regulatory force, but blended with its more complex machinery.

Think of an Uber driver driving someone somewhere. In this apparently
simple business, there are multiple laws in motion: contractual/private
relations, state laws, highway codes, constitutional rights regarding
for example no discrimination, perhaps an insurance. All of those legal
relations regulate the actions between the worker, the client and the
environment. The different [laws and rules]{.underline} in motion during
that specific provision of services are, even in their complexity,
clear, open to everyone willing (or able) to look at them. Those
regulations [are perhaps prescriptive and normative]{.underline}, [but
**ostensibly** free will still exists]{.underline}. Perhaps what is most
important, the enabling **[legislation]{.underline}**, directly or
indirectly, [may be **discussed** and **passed** by some authority with
democratic legitimacy]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
[in]{.underline} the case of [the digital economy]{.underline}, [this is
just **half** of the story]{.underline}. The [interactions between the
worker and the customer are **meticulously controlled** by the
algorithm]{.underline}. Uber uses multiple algorithms and pieces of
software to control the way workers and customers match, to set the
prices and the route. It measures the speed, the way a driver uses car
brakes. It measures the time. It finally captures the rating given by
the customer to the worker to establish a rank. The [working
conditions]{.underline} of a business present in 63 countries, with
nearly 3 million drivers (Sainato, 2019), [are regulated by
algorithms]{.underline}, [a **new kind of private law** coded by the
owners of capital]{.underline}, [with **no State** or **supreme
authority** above the corporation whatsoever]{.underline}.

Tech and law academics such as Hildebrandt (2018), Yeung (2011, 2017,
2018), Pasquale (2020), among others, have analysed how [corporations
are using digital technologies to enhance **new forms** of algorithmic
control and surveillance over citizens]{.underline}. These
[technologies]{.underline}, labelled as automated decision-making (being
algorithmic regulation a form of automated decision-making), [have been
designed to regulate and control behaviour through]{.underline} a
process of **[automated data collection]{.underline}**, [**analysis**
and]{.underline} delivering of positive/negative
**[incentives]{.underline}** to 'individuals for specific actions'
(Cristianini and Scantamburlo, 2019: 647), aimed to reach a previously
defined objective (Yeung, 2018: 507). Or put it in other words, [a form
of social control based on a **cybernetic feedback loop**]{.underline}.
This sociotechnical framework would be composed of code, a system of
automated data collection and the wider sociopolitical environment
(Spielkamp, 2019).

Yeung argues that, in appearance, algorithmic regulation looks like any
other architectural or design-based techniques of control and hence it
is structured around three core components: setting standards, gathering
information and finding the ways to enforce standards and modify
behaviour. However, Yeung (2018), considers that [algorithmic regulation
**differs**]{.underline} from architectural regulation [in two critical
aspects]{.underline}: [its **adaptive feature**]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} extraordinarily [**technological power** driving the
algorithms]{.underline}. These technologies are currently [being used by
public and private institutions around the world]{.underline}, in
sectors such as education, policing, welfare and health, to name a few,
[with **catastrophic consequences** for the citizenry]{.underline}. A
societal automating process (Spielkamp, 2019) orchestrated by
public--private initiatives, ideologically driven by exacerbated waves
of neoliberalism. This form of algorithmic power is [leading to a **new
form of social ordering** intimately connected with digital and
surveillance capitalism]{.underline} (Morozov, 2019; Zuboff, 2019).

Tech and law scholars' critique of automated decisions highlights the
lack of accountability, transparency and public review of automated
decision system, making these technologies inscrutable and eventually
incontestable. [Liberals argue that algorithmic regulation is
**threatening**]{.underline} key aspects of (allegedly) **[Western
Values]{.underline}** (Kantayya, 2020) such as equality,
non-discrimination, free speech and representative democracy. For them,
[the solution would be]{.underline} to stablish a **[legal
protection]{.underline}** by the design that would 'safeguard our
ability -- as individuals -- to challenge automated decision systems, by
providing time and space to test and contest the workings of such
systems' (Hildebrandt, 2018: 16). Despite the relevance and pertinency
of their arguments, [the liberal critique]{.underline} to the
algorithmic domination exerted by corporations [is **limited in
reach**]{.underline}, [**depth** and **scope** by the **liberal** and
**individualistic values** underpinning their arguments]{.underline}.
[They **do not see** algorithmic regulation as]{.underline} a form of
[**class oppression** but a threat to the **individual
liberties**]{.underline} reified by liberalism, [and hence]{.underline}
they [are **unable** to see how the rise of these sociotechnical system
is leading to the production of **new forms of exploitation** and
**subjectivation**]{.underline}.

### AT: Liberalism Solves War/Violence

#### Liberal capitalism has [abandoned]{.underline} rationality in favor of [computation]{.underline} as the guiding force behind its decisionmaking. \[Liberal norms/democracy/trade/etc\] [fuels]{.underline} the endlessly violent expansion of the cybernetic episteme across the [globe]{.underline}, which their data can [never]{.underline} account for because it's the endpoint they're [trying to reach]{.underline}.

**Mbembe, 21**---research professor in history and politics at the Wits
Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of the
Witwatersrand (Achille, "Futures of Life and Futures of Reason," Public
Culture (2021) 33 (1 (93)): 11--33, dml)

[One of the **major contradictions** of the liberal order has always
been the tension between **freedom** and **security**]{.underline}.
Today, this question seems to have been cut in two. [Security now
matters **more** than freedom]{.underline}. A society of security is not
necessarily a society of freedom. A society of security is a society
dominated by the irrepressible need for adhesion to a collection of
certainties. It is a society fearful of the type of interrogation that
delves into the unknown, unearthing the risks that must surely be
contained within. This is why, in a society of security, [the priority
is]{.underline}, **[at all cost]{.underline}**, [to identify what lurks
behind each new arrival]{.underline}---who is who, who lives where, with
whom and since when, who does what, who comes from where, who is going
where, when, how, why, and so on and so forth. Moreover, [who plans to
carry out which acts]{.underline}, either consciously or unconsciously.
[The aim]{.underline} of a society of security [is not to affirm
freedom]{.underline}, [but to **control** and **govern**]{.underline}
the modes of arrival.

[Current myths claim that technology constitutes the **best tool** for
governing these arrivals]{.underline}, [that technology **alone** allows
for the resolution of this problem]{.underline}---a problem [of
**order**]{.underline}, but also of awareness, of identifiers, of
[**anticipation** and **predictions**]{.underline}. [It is **feared**
that the dream of a **humanity transparent**]{.underline} to herself,
**[stripped of mystery]{.underline}**, [might prove to be a
**catastrophic illusion**]{.underline}. For the time being,
[**migrants** and **refugees** are bearing the brunt of it]{.underline}.
In the long run, [it is **by no means certain** that they will be the
only ones]{.underline}.

Perhaps more than at any other moment in our recent past, we are
increasingly faced with the question of what to do with those whose very
existence does not seem to be necessary for our reproduction; those
whose mere existence or proximity is deemed to represent a physical or
biological threat to our own life. Throughout history, and in response
to this foundational question, various paradigms of rules have been
designed for human bodies deemed in excess, unwanted, illegal,
dispensable, or superfluous.

One historical response has consisted in putting in place spatial
exclusionary arrangements. Such was, for instance, the case during the
early phases of modern settler or genocidal colonialism in relation to
Native American reservations in the United States, island prisons, penal
colonies such as Australia, camps and Bantustans in South Africa. In
late modern models of colonial occupation, control of vulnerable,
unwanted, surplus, or racialized people is exercised through a
combination of tactics, chief among which are confinement and modulated
blockade. A blockade prohibits, obstructs, and limits who and what can
enter and leave a confined space.

The goal might not be to cut the confined space off entirely from supply
lines, infrastructural grids, or trade routes. Such a space is
nevertheless relatively sealed off in a way that effectively turns it
into an imprisoned territory. Comprehensive confinement or relative
closure is accompanied by periodic military escalations and the
generalized use of extrajudicial assassinations. Spatial violence,
humanitarian strategies, and a peculiar biopolitics of punishment
combine to produce, in turn, a peculiar carceral space in which people
deemed surplus, unwanted, or illegal are governed through abdication of
any responsibility for their lives and their welfare (Parizot 2018;
Peteet 2018).

But there is another, early twenty-first-century example. It consists of
[new forms of wars]{.underline}, which can be called wars on speed and
mobility (Papastergiadis 2010). Wars on mobility are wars whose
[aim]{.underline} is [to **turn to dust** the means of **existence** and
**survival** of vulnerable people taken as enemies]{.underline}. [These
kinds of wars of attrition]{.underline}, [**methodically calculated**
and **programmed**]{.underline}, [and implemented with new
methods]{.underline}, [are wars against]{.underline} the very ideas of
mobility, circulation, and speed, while the age we live in is precisely
one of velocity, acceleration, and increasing abstraction and
algorithms. Moreover, the targets of this kind of warfare are not by any
means singular bodies, but rather [**great swathes** of humanity judged
**worthless** and **superfluous**]{.underline}.

All of the above belongs to the current practice of **[remote
borderization]{.underline}**, [carried out from afar in the name of
freedom and security]{.underline} (Amoore 2014). This battle, [waged
against certain undesirables and aimed at reducing them to mounds of
human flesh]{.underline}, [is rolled out on a **global
scale**]{.underline}. [It is on the verge of **defining** the times in
which we live]{.underline}. Wars on mobility are peculiar wars on bodies
at a time when belonging is weaponized. [A **systematic effort** to
target superfluous populations is undertaken by **numerous
states**]{.underline}. Since only those of the same stock belong, the
right [to **brutalize**]{.underline} others [with the **near guarantee**
of no legal consequences]{.underline} is extended in some instances to
organized mobs, the police, and the bureaucracy. As Arjun Appadurai
notes, poor marginalized men, jobless or badly employed youth, and
slum-confined casual laborers are mobilized and seduced by this type of
violence and other dreams of national, ethnic, racial, or religious
purity (Appadurai 2019).

Reason on Trial

These are also times when many are gradually coming to the realization
that [reason **may well have reached its limits**]{.underline}. Or, in
any case, it is a time when reason is on trial---[we are]{.underline},
in other words, [in a]{.underline} sort of **[Dark
Enlightenment]{.underline}**. Reason is a faculty we used to recognize
in humans and in humans alone. [In the Western tradition]{.underline} we
have all, willingly or not, become the inheritors of reason: [reason was
always]{.underline} seen as [the **highest** of all human
faculties]{.underline}, the one [that opened the doors to]{.underline}
knowledge, wisdom, **[virtue]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}, most
importantly, **[freedom]{.underline}**. Although unequally redistributed
among humans, it was their prerogative alone. Reason distinguished
humans from other living species. Thanks to their superior capacity to
exercise this faculty, humans could claim to be exceptional.

Today, reason is on trial in two ways. First, [reason is **increasingly
replaced** and **subsumed** by instrumental rationality]{.underline},
[when it is not simply **reduced** to]{.underline} procedural or
**[algorithmic processing]{.underline}** of information. In other words,
the logic of reason is morphing from within machines and computers and
algorithms. [The human brain is **no longer** the privileged location of
reason]{.underline}. [The human brain is being]{.underline}
"**[downloaded]{.underline}**" [into **nanomachines**]{.underline}. [An
**inordinate amount** of power is gradually being ceded to]{.underline}
abstractions of all kinds. Old modes of reasoning are being challenged
by new ones that originate through and within technology in general and
[digital technologies]{.underline} in particular, as well as through the
top-down models of artificial intelligence. As a result, [techne is
becoming the **quintessential language** of reason]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [instrumental reason]{.underline}, or reason in the guise
of techne, [is **increasingly weaponized**]{.underline}. Time itself is
becoming enveloped in the doings of machines. [Machines]{.underline}
themselves [do not simply execute instructions or programs]{.underline}.
[They start generating complex behavior]{.underline}. The computational
reproduction of reason has made it such that reason is no longer, or is
a bit more than, just the domain of the human species. We now share it
with various other agents. [**Reality itself** is increasingly construed
via]{.underline} statistics, **[metadata]{.underline}**, modeling,
mathematics. Second, [many people are **turning their back** on reason
in favor of other faculties and other modes of expression and
cognition]{.underline}. They are calling for a rehabilitation of affect
and emotions, for instance. [In]{.underline} many of [the ongoing
political struggles of our times]{.underline}, [passion is **clearly**
trumping reason]{.underline}. [Confronted with complex
issues]{.underline}, [feeling and acting with one\'s guts]{.underline},
[viscerally rather than reasoning]{.underline}, [is fast becoming the
new norm]{.underline}.

Conclusion

As the new century unfolds, [we are **increasingly surrounded** by
multiple and expanding]{.underline} wave fronts of calculation. More and
more, these wave fronts incorporate life, death, and matter into
[systems of]{.underline} abstraction and **[mechanic
reasoning]{.underline}**. In the process, they generate new automated
couplings between matter and machines, waste and human beings. If
yesterday the modern rational subject\'s raison de vivre was to fight
myth, superstition, and obscurantism, the work of reason nowadays is to
allow for different modes of seeing and measuring to appear. It is to
help human subjects to properly identify the threshold that
distinguishes between the calculable and the incalculable, the
quantifiable and the unquantifiable, the computable and the
incomputable. Technologies of calculation, computation, and
quantification present us with one world among many actual and possible
worlds. As Pasquinelli (2015) argues, different modes of measuring will
open up the possibility of different aesthetics, of different politics
of inhabiting not just the earth, but the universe and, we may add, of
sharing the planet.

[As multiple wave fronts of calculation expand across the
**planet**]{.underline}, [incorporating **more** and **more life** and
**matter** into systems of]{.underline} abstraction and "**[machine
reasoning]{.underline}**," [it becomes urgent to **resist** an
**epistemic hegemony** that **reduces the earth** to a financial
problem]{.underline} and a problem of financial value. To be
intelligent, one still needs consciousness. Indeed, [were data to
**overcode the subject**]{.underline}, to act without reasoning, to
leave behind reflexive thinking and to privilege data correlation,
formal language and inferential deductions would become the norm.
[Sociality would become **totally automated**]{.underline}. [Reason as
we knew it would be **swallowed**]{.underline} within a computational
matrix that trades on circular causality (Parisi 2017).

### AT: Link Non-Unique/"Not Our NATO"

#### This is a [shell game]{.underline}. You shouldn't stake the link on minute differences between our evidence and the plan when the [underlying epistemic commitments]{.underline} are the same. 

**Liljefors, et al, 19**---professor of art history and visual studies
at Lund University (Max, with Gregor Noll and Daniel Steuer,
"Introduction: Our Emerging World of War," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter
1, 7-8, dml)

As the project developed over the past six years, [we repeatedly came up
against]{.underline} two **[difficulties]{.underline}** in particular,
both of which are associated [with]{.underline} temporality. One was the
experience, which all three of us had, that the subject matter was
always running ahead of us, that we could never quite catch up with the
latest developments. Our technological future seemed to be being
developed not only partly in secret but also at a speed that outstripped
our capacities of reflection. The other was [the problem of **specifying
what exactly was new** in the phenomena we were chasing and what was
simply a **continuation of existing tendencies**]{.underline}, features
that might possibly be as old as warfare itself. Our chapters touch upon
these two difficulties, but they do not fully address them.
Nevertheless, these difficulties form the basis of two conclusions that
have determined the way we approach our themes more generally. First,
[the]{.underline} runaway [logic of technological development serves an
**ideological purpose**]{.underline}, that [of **immunizing** inventions
and innovations against criticism]{.underline} ("**[your criticism would
have been appropriate for version 2.0]{.underline}**, **[but it does not
apply to version 2.1]{.underline}**"). Second, [the question
of]{.underline} "**[old versus new]{.underline}**" [may **distract** us
from the **specificity** of what is taking place and thus also help to
**immunize** these]{.underline}---potentially blind---[practices against
criticism]{.underline}. Our original title for the project, now the
title of this introduction, tries to avoid the pitfalls of the
old-versus-new conundrum by emphasizing the specific temporality and
spatiality of "emergence," a process that is not simply a unilinear
progression through empty time or space but closer to an oscillation
between appearance and disappearance, between the ability and inability
to see.

### AT: No Mindset Shift/Self-Transformation Fails

#### Altering subjectivity [alters the social]{.underline}. The cracks in the system are [emerging]{.underline}; reject their calls for pragmatic action.

**Karakilic, 21**---senior research fellow in the RSB Lab at Nottingham
Trent University (Emrah, "Idleness as a micro ethico-political action,"
Organization, 2021, Vol. 28(6) 1049--1058, dml)

Today, the 'end of history' seems to define the ethos of humanity at
large. In the age of 'capitalist realism', Fisher (2009) refers to
Jameson (2003), '[it is easier to imagine the end of the world
than]{.underline} it is to imagine [the end of capitalism]{.underline}'
(p. 2). 'The futurity of future' is cancelled as we have come to believe
that 'the future will be pretty much like the present only more so'
(Eagleton, 2002: para 2, also Fisher, 2014). We must resist the
prevailing capitalist catechism \[investissement\] and keep the question
of 'what is to be done' alive -- the theorists insist. Yet, [if one of
the]{.underline} greatest '[achievements]{.underline}' [of capitalism
lies in]{.underline} 'the capitalisation of subjective power' (Guattari,
2000: 47), that is, [the **capture of**]{.underline} human sensibility,
imagination and **[desire]{.underline}**, [is there **even any
hope**?]{.underline}

My answer is **[affirmative]{.underline}**. As noted, firstly, [the
neoliberal project]{.underline} of transforming every individual into a
business [is **increasingly** in]{.underline} crisis. This is a
**[subjective crisis]{.underline}** in Guattarian parlance, revealing
itself, for Berardi (2015), in the astonishing rise of mental health
problems.6 Secondly, with the Covid-19 pandemic, [it now seems
**inevitable** that we will experience a **deep economic
recession**]{.underline} (Davies, 2020; Elliott, 2020), which will
deepen the subjective crisis when the public starts to foot the bill for
bailouts. Therefore, I agree with Davies (2020) that the impact of [the
pandemic]{.underline} on economies '[might better be understood as the
sort of **world-making event** that allows for **new economic** and
**intellectual beginnings**]{.underline}' (para 12, also Žižek, 2020).

If so, [how might we think of a **new process of subjectivation**
whereby a **new way of being** in the world can be
**actualised**?]{.underline} O'Sullivan (2011, also 2012: 59--87) offers
two central theses on the new in relation to subjectivity. Firstly, he
writes, '[the new does not arrive from some other place]{.underline}
(transcendence), [but]{.underline} is produced from the very matter of
the world. . . After all, where else can the new come from?'
(O'Sullivan, 2011: 97). This means that the new involves a recombination
of already existing elements in and of the world. Yet, is this sort of
recombination enough to produce something new? In the second thesis, he
elucidates, 'what else is needed \[is\] a certain depth. . . Put simply,
the new involves accessing something outside the present plane of
existence' (O'Sullivan, 2011: 97--98). Accordingly, the production of
new -- subjectivity -- [involves **experimentation** with]{.underline}
this sort of immanent outside and returning to the present plane of
existence more equipped with novel perspectives to combine its elements
differently.

In continental philosophy, this outside has a name.7 It is the temporal
realm of virtual or pure-past in Bergson (1991), truth in Foucault
(1995) (or Foucauldian truth) and incorporeal Universes in Guattari
(1995, 2000). This paper cannot do justice to all these concepts. Yet,
it might speculate on what traverses them as a common theme. Here, the
outside implies a realm where one can experience difference-in-kind. It
does not involve identification or imitation of something already
existing because it is characterised by unactualised potentiality. It is
not to do with knowledge as such, particularly with 'scientific'
knowledge, as it does not understand 'evidence', 'proof' or 'fact'. It
is 'non-dimensioned, non-coordinated, trans-sensible and infinite'
(Guattari, 2000: 75). It is a realm of 'absolute
**[non-narrative]{.underline}**, non-culture, [and
**non-knowledge**]{.underline}' (Lazzarato, 2014: 18). More concretely,
it is a realm where one can encounter with hitherto
[unknown]{.underline} '[universes of reference]{.underline}', experiment
with new 'existential refrains and configurations', which
[can]{.underline} then [act]{.underline}, [in the world we are
living]{.underline}, [as **catalytic focal points** for]{.underline}
'[the **resingularisation of existence**]{.underline}' (Guattari, 1995,
2000).

The outside is not immediately accessible or apparent to the human
body-mind configuration in its typical state. [To access and communicate
with this]{.underline} sort of [outside]{.underline}, [there must be a
**break** with already existing reality and its
accompanying]{.underline} significations, narratives, refrains, values,
norms, **[semiotic chains]{.underline}** and enslaving machinic
apparatuses. [There must be]{.underline}, in a word, [a **rupture in
habit**]{.underline}, be it [formed **consciously** or
**impulsively**]{.underline}. This presupposes, first and foremost, a
suspension of the general mobilisation decreed by capital. Workers'
**[strikes]{.underline}**, **[struggles]{.underline}**, [**revolts** and
**riots** do not only operate as **technologies** of such a rupture but
they also **expose** what the heterogeneous elements of the outside
might be]{.underline}. They are the moments of, paradoxically,
non-movement, suspending all dominant references and coordinates with
unforeseeable consequences: 'I am no longer as I was before. I am . . .
carried beyond my familiar existential Territories' (Guattari, 1995:
93).

In this context, [I think of **idleness** as a **micro ethico-political
technology** of such a rupture]{.underline}, a technology of Foucauldian
self-care (see also Munro, 2014; Randall and Munro, 2010), potentially
opening up the aforementioned outside. Nietzsche (1996) argues that
[idleness]{.underline}, **[against hasty mobilisation]{.underline}**,
[is]{.underline} a 'noble thing', 'really the beginning of all vices'
and 'located in the closest vicinity to all virtues' (p. 171). In a
similar vein, Kierkegaard (1946) holds that what is evil is not idleness
but those who dictate that idleness as evil. 'Idleness . . . is a truly
divine life' (Kierkegaard, 1946: 23). He adds that 'every human being
who lacks a sense of idleness proves that his \[or her\] consciousness
has not yet been elevated to the level of the humane' (Kierkegaard,
1946: 24). Does not idleness mean laziness? Nietzsche (1996) mockingly
answers, 'you don't think . . . I am talking about you, do you, you
lazybones?' (p. 171).8 By idleness, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard,
therefore, do **[not]{.underline}** understand [**acceptance** of what
happens]{.underline}, a sort of emptiness or monotony. They
[rather]{.underline} see it as [an **ethico-political action** on one
self]{.underline}. In Nietzsche, idleness refers to the practice of
otium in the form of self-contemplation or what he (Nietzsche, 1996:
171) calls 'meditative life' or 'prolonged reflection' (Nietzsche, 1974:
259). In fact, this reflects the connotation of the term in Elizabethan
English, that is, wandering in the mind. Kierkegaard (1946) implies
something similar when he considers 'the restless activity' (vis-à-vis
an examined life) a barrier before 'the world of the spirit' (p. 24).

[In contemporary capitalism]{.underline}, [we have increasingly become
more like **inputs**]{.underline}, absorbing all stimuli imposed by two
regimes of power (i.e. social subjection and machinic enslavement), [and
**outputs**]{.underline}, [emitting]{.underline} some sort of
[response]{.underline} often [unreflectively]{.underline}. In order [to
open a **gap** between stimulus and response]{.underline} (à la Bergson,
1991), [we should **resist reckless mobilisation**]{.underline}, enjoy
'a vita contemplative (e.g. taking a walk with ideas and friends)
without self-contempt and a bad conscience' (Nietzsche, 1974: 260), [and
attempt to cultivate a **genuine understanding** of our reactive
selves]{.underline}. This '**[self-positioning]{.underline}**'
(Foucault, 2000) [may culminate in]{.underline} '[a kind of
**super-productivity** arising from a **specifically
non-productive**]{.underline} ([in **capitalist terms**]{.underline})
[state]{.underline}' (O'Sullivan, 2011: 99). [Idleness]{.underline},
that is to say, [may enable us to **recognise** and **grasp** not only
our habitual responses and reactions]{.underline}, whose aggregation
ultimately constitutes who we are and how we act, [but also **new
existential terrains**]{.underline} on another vector, [in
which]{.underline} the aspects of [a **different mode of being** could
be found]{.underline}.

### AT: No Spillover

#### Don't view the alt as a single instance, but a [pattern of behavior]{.underline} that spills out like a [fractal]{.underline} in [politically significant ways]{.underline}.

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

May First is infinitesimally small by the standards of the tech economy.
"**[Goldman Sachs doesn't care if you're raising
chickens]{.underline}**", as the political theorist Jodi Dean (2011) has
said. It's a reminder for anyone tempted to see too much potential in
personal practices, technological or otherwise. [But spinning wheels are
**small**]{.underline}, too, [and they helped **drive away the British
Empire**]{.underline}.

adrienne maree brown (2017) credits Grace Lee Boggs for helping her see
that (her emphasis) "[what we practice at the small scale **sets the
patterns** for the **whole system**]{.underline}". She explains this in
a chapter called "Fractals", which recalls how she shifted her activism
to better reflect her political values in daily practice. [Fractals are
mathematical phenomena]{.underline}, frequent in nature, [whose patterns
at smaller scales **repeat** at larger scales]{.underline}. They are
appealing and widely used as a metaphor, being both mathematically
precise in theory and conveniently vague when applied to human affairs.
Those like brown and Boggs who apply fractal-talk to politics exercise a
kind of faith. To make good on that faith, there must some linkage, some
strategy, that connects self-governance from the scale of small
communities to the larger societies those community seek to transform.
[There was a fractal in the **free maroons of Saint-Domingue** who
stormed down from their mountains into combat with French troops so the
whole island could be free]{.underline}.

[There was a fractal in]{.underline} the spinning wheel on [the **Indian
National Congress** flag]{.underline}, [extending from a traditional
practice to an eventual industrial policy]{.underline}. These chickens
came to roost because they were part of a strategy that involved
organised confrontation with colonial power. [Self-governing became a
**challenge**]{.underline}, [a **threat**]{.underline}. In **[even small
experiments]{.underline}**, governable stacks [can begin to
**normalise** the otherwise elusive fact that **better ways of
organising technology** are possible]{.underline}. [Carefully chosen
practices **sever habits of dependency** on the systems we seek to
resist]{.underline}.

### AT: Scenario Planning

#### Scenario planning fuels cybernetic militarism. You should prioritize [speculation]{.underline} about the futures they foreclose over [narrow predictions]{.underline} and [cost-benefit assessments]{.underline} within single scenarios.

**Grove, 20**---Associate Professor of International Relations at The

Following Bohr, I share the position that [the future **does not
exist**]{.underline}. Instead, for me, [the value of **speculative
assessments of global order** come from what such exercises mean for the
**present**]{.underline}.18 [Decisions about **weapons
development**]{.underline}, [commitments to **international
institutions**]{.underline}, [the **hubristic foreign policies** that
lead to **war**]{.underline}, [are **pursued on the backs of assumed
futures**]{.underline}. For instance, if strategic decision-makers in
the U.S. military were not confident in their ability to build a missile
shield and deploy disruptive artificial intelligence based weapons
platforms it seems likely that they, and the policy-makers they inform,
would not be as likely to abandon institutions like the United Nations
or so casually escalate competition with states like China and Russia.

Therefore, [the positing of **other possible futures** in geopolitics
creates **counter-futures** that can **undermine the confidence** that
comes from contemporary claims about the **inevitability of
technological development**]{.underline}.19 [Beyond being **just another
scenario** in the pile of future scenarios]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} kind of **[speculative future]{.underline}** offered
here [tries to insist that **multiple futures be consider at once**
rather than **assessing probabilities** and **picking the one future**
that seems the **best**]{.underline} '**[bet]{.underline}**'. In this I
am offering an alternative image of the transformation scenario offered
by the DoD and those in Silicon Valley who offer automation as a future
of egalitarian luxury. Rather than accepting transformation, the vision
of the future I build here considers what continued growth of existing
capability would look like within our current framework and how
continued growth may actually create unplanned transformations without
the 'breakthroughs' we have been promised.

So, [what is offered]{.underline} in this article [is an effort to
**proliferate** the number of possible outcomes considered so that we
can do **more** than simply]{.underline} '**[disprove]{.underline}**'
the [predictions made about]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and **automation**]{.underline}. It is
to show that [the **partial success** and **failure** of these pursuits
can **still have transformative effects**]{.underline} [just not the
effects we thought could be leveraged for strategic advantage or global
hegemony without a **significant cost** to the form of life that
hegemony was meant to protect]{.underline}.

### AT: State Good

#### Voting neg doesn't reject the state entirely, but it [does]{.underline} disrupt the [new channels]{.underline} of cybernetic governance that the aff opens up, which is [sufficient]{.underline}. The academy can turn cybernetics against itself, but only the alt's critical stance [alone]{.underline} solves.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 123-127, dml)

This focus upon notionally [public institutions being **re-geared** as
productive businesses]{.underline} or capitals [has been **amplified**
through the instantiation of **competition** among individual
academics]{.underline}, disciplines and institutions, [whose activities
and impact are **quantified**]{.underline}. [Quantification and flows of
data are **crucial** in the ongoing re-purposing of the University as a
**productive domain**]{.underline}, [and in opening it out to other
economic sectors which are able to make use of those data to **commodify
new services**]{.underline}, and thereby extract value or rents. This
has been discussed globally in terms of massive open online courses
(MOOCs), in particular focused upon processes for creating commodities
and data that can be curated for exchange-value (see Hall 2015b;
Shanley, Swierstra & Wyatt, Chapter 11, in this volume).

In the English context, the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills (DBIS 2015) has enacted policy that links educational outcomes
and HM Revenue & Customs tax data, in order to leverage data about
populations of graduates and the value of their educational profiles.
This connects to work commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE)
on graduate (longitudinal educational) outcomes, and new regulatory
structures through the creation of the Office for Students (OfS)
enshrined in the Higher Education and Research Act (DfE 2017), which
have generated an infrastructure for managing competition within the
sector, through a focus on value-for-money and the availability of
performance data.

[The availability of such data frames a **technocratic discourse** for
continuous improvement through the management of risk in open
markets]{.underline}, [with effective competition defined as the
**primary enabler** of]{.underline} student and institutional
[success]{.underline}. Such metrics are immanent to the generation of
human capital and commodity-knowledge, and they shape a context for the
ongoing valorization of the labour of both academics and students. This
is increasingly important in a competitive HE environment, precisely
because the value of a commodity, or of a commodified service like an
accredited award, is not given by its price. Rather, it is given by the
quantity of labour that is socially necessary for its production at a
given, global, average productivity. It is given by the amount of labour
embedded in the product. Thus, commodities produced by labourers with
more knowledge or skills, or richer technologies, either have higher
value or can be produced more efficiently, and deliver competitive edge.

However, capital is always seeking to drive down the cost of labour, in
order to extract a surplus from its investment. This search for
surplus-value brings labourers into asymmetrical relationships in the
market, as their labour is sorted and compared, based on its ability to
deliver value for the employer. [While an educator might be producing a
book]{.underline}, [marking scripts or undertaking knowledge
transfer]{.underline}, [in the market their work is **abstracted** from
its concrete context]{.underline}, [so that it can be **equalized**
across a global terrain]{.underline}. It is [the integration of this
abstract form of labour inside a technology-rich]{.underline},
[educational context]{.underline} that [is designed to produce
**wealth**]{.underline} in the form of surplus-value, which can be
described in terms of valorization (Hall 2018). [This]{.underline}
process [tends towards the **proletarianization** of academic
labour]{.underline} by rationalizing its processes or modes of
production, such that labour-value as a cost of production (use-value)
is reduced. Here, having appropriate performance data, locked inside
systems of production that can be finessed in almost real-time, with
feedback that enables new modes of production, is crucial. [There is
potential]{.underline} here [for **new cybernetic modes of management**
for academic production]{.underline}, [rooted in **quantification** and
the **internalization** of algorithmic regulation]{.underline}
(McQuillan 2015).

One result of this refocusing of HE for productivity and profitability,
by increasing the realm of valuable work (in that it generates new forms
of capital), has been to subsume the politics of HE under economic
dictates. Thus, [governance and regulation tend to reinforce a
**normative**]{.underline}, [**technology-neutral narrative**
of]{.underline} HE, immanent to [progressive ideas of
**entrepreneurship**]{.underline}, excellence and impact,
[and]{.underline} reliant upon educational outcomes as exchangeable
commodities that demonstrate accrued human capital. Technocratic
governance conditions academic work through [mediations like **private
property**]{.underline}, [the **division of labour** and **commodity
exchange**]{.underline} (Hall 2018).

It is important to recognize the inhuman impacts of techniques of
re-engineering, and technologies that have been used to discipline
labour both at work and across society more generally. This has been
witnessed in [increased reporting]{.underline} by academic labourers
[of]{.underline} ill-health, overwork and **[precarity]{.underline}**
(Hall & Bowles 2016). However, these moments of reporting [point towards
categories of experience that are **analytically
generalizable**]{.underline} in the concrete experiences of individuals,
but which also enable their source to be revealed in alienated labour
(Hall 2018). [The **horizontal sharing** of such narratives]{.underline}
also [enables a **surfacing of experience** that might **coalesce** as a
shared operating system]{.underline}, [architecture or platform from
which **struggle can emerge**]{.underline}. [The point of such
revelations is to highlight the possibilities for
**deliberation**]{.underline}, [**association** and
**solidarity**]{.underline}.

For academic labourers, struggle is immanent to, and cuts through, a
range of intersecting narratives, and these intersections reveal
commonalities of experience grounded in alienating and commodified work.
[This offers the potential for **reimagining** that experience for a
**different social purpose**]{.underline}. It is important to recognize
that [such reimaginings are situated **historically** and
**materially**]{.underline}, [with deep connections to the ability of
communities to **re-purpose** technology for socially useful outcomes
that point **beyond value production**]{.underline} (Haiven 2014).
[These include established **transnational commons** and **peer-to-peer
networks**]{.underline} (P2P Foundation n.d.), [alongside state-based
interventions]{.underline}, [like]{.underline} Ecuador's Free-Libre,
Open Knowledge Society project (**[FLOK]{.underline}** n.d.)
[or]{.underline} the **[Cybersyn]{.underline}** project in Chile under
Allende (Miller Medina 2005). However, [they also include]{.underline}:
[first]{.underline}, [a **multitude** of workers]{.underline} in the
digital, platform economy [struggling against precarity]{.underline}
(Lorey 2017), including non-tenured academics and teachers; [and
second]{.underline}, social movements with **[educational
intent]{.underline}**, for instance, Rhodes Must Fall and work on
decolonization emerging from Black Lives Matter. These use technologies
to describe associational practices and values as pedagogical projects
at the level of society.

Such descriptions can be enriched through engagement with the idea of
digital platforms (Kornberger, Pflueger & Mouritsen 2017; Srnicek 2017),
in describing knowledge production that reimagines social reproduction
beyond institutions like the University. [Is it possible for knowledge
production]{.underline}, capitalized and valorized [inside the
University]{.underline}, [to be **liberated**]{.underline} across the
social terrain **[against capital's cybernetic control
mechanisms]{.underline}**, [for **more humane ends**?]{.underline} Is it
possible to bear witness to those humane ends as a movement beyond
discontent, to describe new forms of autonomous activity that constitute
'selfgovernment for the producers', and which point towards forms of
education beyond 'the fetters placed upon it by class and government'
(Marx 2008: 47)?

Following Marx's engagement with machines and technology (1991), [it is
**important** to **critique platform technology** as it reproduces new
forces of production]{.underline}, [which then enable new social
relations and forms of organization]{.underline}, including precarious
labour, insecurity and entrepreneurship of the self. Such forms of
organization are a means of rationalizing necessary social labour and
creating anew the sphere of heteronomy, which organizes the production
of necessities (Gorz 1982; Marx 1991). This demands that academics
reproduce new skills, knowledge and capabilities to be exchanged, and
thereby annihilates the time for free activity or the sphere of
autonomy. [A critique of these processes asks]{.underline}: [How do we
**liberate** digital tools from **inside**]{.underline} organizations
like **[universities]{.underline}**, in order [to create
**non-commodified spaces**]{.underline} for direct, cooperative
reproduction (Roggero 2011)? This needs to be an intersectional critique
of institutionalized technologies and techniques, precisely because
those bodies marginalized by class, race, gender, (dis)ability and
sexuality have lacked power to widen their spheres of autonomy (Ahmed
2017; Ciccariello-Maher 2017). [There is a **clear need** to **describe
the modes** by which capitalized]{.underline} platform [technologies
**enable** social relations that are **exploitative**]{.underline} for
those in the core of institutions, while it further expropriates those
on the margins (Fraser & Jaeggi 2018).

This chapter describes [the potential]{.underline} for the intersection
of social movements of struggle with digital technologies, [to **uncover
alternative imaginings**]{.underline} for HE beyond the quantified
University. This [is **enabled** in the production of socially useful
knowledge **specifically designed to refuse hegemonic power** over the
world]{.underline}. Here, [**discontent** with the world as it is
becomes a moment to **re-purpose** and **transform** technologies and
techniques by embedding them inside **solidarity
economies**]{.underline}. [Such processes facilitate **platforms for
dissent**]{.underline}. [This **explicitly challenges**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} transhistorical, positivist [idea of the University as
a space for knowledge production that **co-opts** technology in order to
**reinforce** monopoly capitalism]{.underline}. It asks if [discontent
at the level of the **platform** might **disrupt** the
University]{.underline} such that we can reimagine that a different
higher education is possible.

### AT: Timeframe/Try Or Die

#### You should [flip]{.underline} "try-or-die" and [choose]{.underline} to understand the timeframe for our impact as [imminent]{.underline}, [even if]{.underline} the technology [itself]{.underline} is far away. Once it's here, it's too late!

**Liljefors, et al, 19**---professor of art history and visual studies
at Lund University (Max, with Gregor Noll and Daniel Steuer,
"Introduction: Our Emerging World of War," *War and Algorithm*, Chapter
1, 2, dml)

The first point we wish to make in this introduction is that public
[**debates** about radically new and powerful ways of waging war must
take place **long before** any conflicts that might motivate their
employment. Once technologies have **emerged** and
**matured**]{.underline}, [history will have **invested itself** in the
new possibilities]{.underline}, [and the space of politics will have
**shrunk**]{.underline}. Because we are approaching our subject before
it has fully matured, describing and analyzing it presupposes a measure
of speculation. Franck and his colleagues saw, with appropriate clarity,
that [radically innovative ways of waging war will **radically
transform** our societies]{.underline}, [even in times of
**peace**]{.underline}. Major conurbations, as suitable targets for the
use of nuclear weapons, would become huge liabilities for the United
States, as the report made clear. Franck and his colleagues observed
that the bomb would transform the way Americans lived and worked; in
this way, they went beyond the science of nuclear physics into the
broader sciences of the social and the political. In doing so, they
expressed a general fact about technology. [Technology]{.underline} not
only serves the purpose for which it is invented but also
**[determines]{.underline}**, [through its **form**]{.underline}, [a
particular type of **social synthesis**]{.underline}: [a way in which
humans who use that technology will **find themselves organized** in
space and time]{.underline}. Nuclear physics endowed the Franck report
with authority, but its content could have been authored by any
reasoning human being daring to extrapolate from technological ground to
social form. It was most definitely written for such reasoning human
beings.

The second point to be made, then, is that [reflection on an emerging
world of war **cannot be restricted** to certain]{.underline}
specialized [disciplines]{.underline}. [Those who reflect on this world
must give themselves the **speculative means** to do so]{.underline}.
These means are to be found in the various traditions of thought,
speech, and visual representation that are at work in the novel forms
warfare takes, traditions that thus make the emergence of these forms
seem plausible or even historically inevitable. Taking our cue from
these means, we may extrapolate from them into the future, attempting,
as it were in a different key, to do what Franck's group did for nuclear
warfare (even if they did it, through no fault of their own, all too
late). Any resistance can only grow from the point that emerges once we
have gone far enough, deep enough, in our pursuit of the traditions of
representation that are now morphing into a world of war. [It is at that
point that **different views** and **possible trajectories** might open
up]{.underline}, perspectives [from which it becomes **clear** that the
**seemingly inevitable escalation** of war is in fact **not inevitable
at all**]{.underline}.

### AT: Tech Good/Inevitable

#### This is a false choice! We don't reject technology or cybernetic thought wholesale, we [reorient]{.underline} it towards self-governance, which [spills up]{.underline} to challenge technology's relationship to structural domination.

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

The spinning wheel remains a cipher and a site of conflict, an everyday
technology summoned to a contest over the meaning of democracy. Despite
having political ties with Gandhi's assassin, the Hindu nationalist
prime minister Narendra Modi promotes homespun cloth and has done
photo-ops operating a spinning wheel. Modi has meanwhile shuttered
boards that gave artisans a voice in policy under the slogan "Minimum
Government and Maximum Governance" (Vincent 2020). The [technology
itself does not guarantee self-governance]{.underline}, [but it can be
the **symbolic base** from which **ever-enlarging acts** of
self-governance **defeat an empire**]{.underline}.

In the spirit of the technological cipher I propose the pursuit of
"governable stacks": [an orientation toward **ungovernable organising**
under digital colonialism]{.underline}.

The geek-colloquial meaning of stack, in the most relevant sense, is a
set of interoperating hardware and software. Benjamin H. Bratton (2016,
xvii) goes further, describing the stack as "a new architecture for how
we divide the world into sovereign spaces". Its layers [come with
**intersecting relations** of dependency]{.underline}, [along with
**emergent freedoms**]{.underline}. A stack might include all that
enables one to use a social media service, for instance: the server
farms, the corporation that owns them, its investors, the software the
servers run on, the secret algorithms that analyse one's data, the
mobile device, its accelerometer sending biometric data to the server
farm, the network provider, the backdoor access for law enforcement, and
so on. The layers of a stack might further include the sun or coal
powering it, the wars fuelled by rare-earth mining, and the mythologies
and rituals that dictate what people in it will tolerate. Each layer is
in fact multiple layers, and layers build on each other.

Before governable stacks were the topic of this article, they were an
experience for me, particularly through an organisation in which I have
been an anecdotal participantobserver for a decade. **[May
First]{.underline}** Movement Technology (mayfirst.coop) is a
cooperative that [provides **web hosting**]{.underline}, **[cloud
services]{.underline}**, [and **public education** for]{.underline} a
850-strong membership composed largely of [activist
organisations]{.underline} in the United States and Mexico (Lopez et al.
2007). Through [the tools]{.underline} May First offers, I have been
able to [move]{.underline} much of my daily [computing **away** from
companies that **surveil** and **extract** into]{.underline} servers I
co-own and govern, running **[commons-based software]{.underline}**. I
have formed relationships with the people who maintain these services
and participated in decision-making over bilingual conference calls and
online ballots. I learn about new tools from fellow members, and we
sponsor events that teach people outside our membership how to challenge
the power of big tech in their lives and their communities. Akin to the
slow food movement, [this is **slow computing**]{.underline} (Schneider
2015), its pace [measured not by bandwidth or processing speed but by
the attention to the **social dimensions** of everyday
practice]{.underline}.

While Silicon Valley elites escape to phone-free retreats (Marantz 2019)
and agonise about their children's exposure to screens (Bowles 2018),
May First offers no such "abhorrence of machinery" (Chaplin 1966, 373).
[It **does not accept the false choice** between]{.underline} addictive,
[**surveillance-addled apps** and a **fantasy of**]{.underline}
returning to **[some blissful innocence]{.underline}**. Instead,
[members share technologies that **do what they need** and that they can
**reasonably control**]{.underline}. [These technologies]{.underline},
[and the self-governance we surround them with]{.underline}, are our
stack. May First does not demand that you 'learn to code', or otherwise
trade traditional knowledge for digital expertise. For me, being part of
a governable stack like May First has **[unlocked political
possibilities]{.underline}**. The experience motivated years of working
to build governable stacks elsewhere, because I know that it can be
done. I poured myself into [developing alternative ownership models
like]{.underline} "**[platform cooperatives]{.underline}**" (Schneider
2018) [and]{.underline} "**[exit to community]{.underline}**" (Mannan
and Schneider 2021) [that are **better suited** to making tech
governable]{.underline}. With time, ungovernable stacks have come to
feel like foreign lands. I may use them, but they never feel like home.

Governable stacks are [cyborg assemblages of inter-operating
technology]{.underline}, [in symbiosis with human
relationships]{.underline} (Haraway 1991; Puar 2012). Those
relationships [organise power]{.underline}, [in **partnership** with the
technology more than through **domination** over it]{.underline}. We
learn with each other, and we learn with [the machines]{.underline},
which take on life of their own -- through their own intelligence, or
that which we affectionately project onto them. In the sense of Grace
Lee and Jimmy Boggs's dialectical humanism, governable stacks [invite
the people who use them to **change their relationship** with
technologies]{.underline}, [to **imagine different sorts** of
technologies]{.underline}, [and to be **changed
themselves**]{.underline}.

[Perhaps governability can be achieved by **reconfiguring** tools that
already exist]{.underline}; [perhaps it is necessary to **make new
ones**]{.underline}. Tiziana Terranova (2014), who has proposed the
complementary idea of a "red stack", writes that [insurgent stacks
become]{.underline} "[new platforms through a **crafty bricolage** of
existing technologies]{.underline}, the enactment of new subjectivities
through a detournement of widespread social media literacy". Older
technologies may be better suited to this than newer ones (Maxigas and
Latzko-Toth 2020). [Even the colonial platforms can be
**repurposed**]{.underline} -- as the Algerian writer Kateb Yacine said
of the French language -- [as **spoils of war**]{.underline}. The
lifeblood of the governable stack is not any claim to innovation but the
self-governance that flows through it. What emerges from there is the
point.

The **[Guifi.net]{.underline}** community Internet network in Catalonia
(guifi.net) [became the condition of possibility for a suite
of]{.underline} "**[community cloud]{.underline}**"
[services]{.underline} deployed through it (Selimi et al. 2015).
**[FairTEC]{.underline}** (fairtec.io) [combines]{.underline} into one
product [a stack of preexisting services across]{.underline} three
[European countries]{.underline}: a sustainably manufactured smartphone,
a non-commercial operating system, a cooperative telecom, and a
cooperative phone rental company. The developers of the
**[CommonsCloud]{.underline}** (commonscloud.coop) [see their shared
technology as only one layer of a larger community stack]{.underline},
[which also includes]{.underline} "**[social]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[discursive]{.underline}**" [layers]{.underline} --
the context and substance of their self-governance. Layers form over
time, too. [Governable stacks of the past lurk in the archaeology of
colonial systems through legacies like **Indymedia**]{.underline}, an
activist social network whose participatory servers and software
prefigured the corporate "Web 2.0" (Pickard 2006). Indymedia itself drew
from decades of organising among activist communityradio stations,
particularly in Latin America (Ruiz Martinez 2021). [There can be **no
one governable stack**]{.underline} -- [only **many**]{.underline},
[whose archipelagos of commoning **enable each other** and **give rise
to more**]{.underline}.

Technologists seeking alternative visions have often gravitated to the
Free Software and Open Source movements, which employ creative licensing
to enable the sharing of accessible and modifiable code. These movements
have been successful in terms of the sheer volume of widely used
software in their commons. But their emphasis on the freedoms of
individual users, as well as of corporations, has privileged those with
the technical know-how to take advantage. The software commons has
spawned operating systems that fly in military jets and databases that
aid in the imprisonment of asylum seekers (Ehmke 2020). In the name of
freedom, too, developers have harboured sexism and other forms of
exclusionary culture (SSL Nagbot 2016). Governable stacks should
prioritise community accountability alongside individual freedom.

Another emerging strategy for challenging digital colonialism has come
from within. Employees at Silicon Valley giants have achieved reforms by
organising against certain ethical outrages at their workplaces (Tarnoff
2020). Yet there are limits to what these campaigns are likely to
achieve, since these workers are invested -- often literally, through
stock options -- in the basic business models of their employers.
Employees' actions can present the impression that their protest
cleanses the colonial tools they produce. Governable stacks do not seek
merely to improve the occupier. "Decolonization is not an 'and'", as
Tuck and Yang (2012) put it. "It is an elsewhere" (36).

Experiences with governable stacks introduce us to possible elsewheres.
The spinning wheel was an elsewhere, the invention of a democratic
India. May First Movement Technology is an elsewhere for its members,
who in turn become part of its learning and evolving. Collectives,
families, and movements can assemble and adjust their stacks over time,
wherever possible seeking to make their technological lives ever more
governable. I next turn to strategies to guide the process of doing so.

5\. Governable Strategy

May First is infinitesimally small by the standards of the tech economy.
"Goldman Sachs doesn't care if you're raising chickens", as the
political theorist Jodi Dean (2011) has said. It's a reminder for anyone
tempted to see too much potential in personal practices, technological
or otherwise. But spinning wheels are small, too, and they helped drive
away the British Empire.

adrienne maree brown (2017) credits Grace Lee Boggs for helping her see
that (her emphasis) "[what we practice at the small scale **sets the
patterns** for the **whole system**]{.underline}". She explains this in
a chapter called "Fractals", which recalls how she shifted her activism
to better reflect her political values in daily practice. [Fractals are
mathematical phenomena]{.underline}, frequent in nature, [whose patterns
at smaller scales **repeat** at larger scales]{.underline}. They are
appealing and widely used as a metaphor, being both mathematically
precise in theory and conveniently vague when applied to human affairs.
Those like brown and Boggs who apply fractal-talk to politics exercise a
kind of faith. To make good on that faith, there must some linkage, some
strategy, that connects self-governance from the scale of small
communities to the larger societies those community seek to transform.
[There was a fractal in the **free maroons of Saint-Domingue** who
stormed down from their mountains into combat with French troops so the
whole island could be free]{.underline}.

[There was a fractal in]{.underline} the spinning wheel on [the **Indian
National Congress** flag]{.underline}, [extending from a traditional
practice to an eventual industrial policy]{.underline}. These chickens
came to roost because they were part of a strategy that involved
organised confrontation with colonial power. [Self-governing became a
**challenge**]{.underline}, [a **threat**]{.underline}. In **[even small
experiments]{.underline}**, governable stacks [can begin to
**normalise** the otherwise elusive fact that **better ways of
organising technology** are possible]{.underline}. [Carefully chosen
practices **sever habits of dependency** on the systems we seek to
resist]{.underline}.

### AT: You're Using A Computer

[Computing played an **important role** in bringing
together]{.underline} this [collective discussion]{.underline}: not only
as a subject matter, given that the algorithmic, in all of its diverse
instantiations and multiple understandings, is a recurring research
object for each of us. [While we were able to meet in person on a
**few** occasions]{.underline}, [most]{.underline} of the [conversation
took place **online**]{.underline}, [on **platforms**]{.underline} such
as Zoom and Google Docs. These are [run by **private actors**
involved]{.underline}, [as **data sources** or **algorithm
providers**]{.underline}, [in **security practices** ranging from **law
enforcement** to **warfare**]{.underline}, [including practices that we
have been **questioning in this very collective

us]{.underline}. [It **actually highlights even further** the urgency of
discussing **how**, through **what digital means**]{.underline}, [a
**critique of algorithmic violence** can be carried out]{.underline}.
[Currently, a **massive digitalization** of education]{.underline}, from
elementary schools to universities, [is happening at **unprecedented

in view of "mediating" critique, as in "work\[ing\] as one link in a

of life" (Austin, Bellanova, and Kaufmann 2019, 4). Hence, [rather than

#### The alt fails as soon as it's used in [actual struggles]{.underline} against cybernetic power, if it isn't [hijacked]{.underline} by hegemonic forces [from the get go]{.underline}. Legal solutions to algorithmic violence are more effective by [every metric]{.underline}.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko, 19**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, "What Is to Be Done?," *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital

In their "a user's guide for privacy and protest," Finn Brunton and
Helen Nissenbaum (2015, "Introduction") summarize these and similar
tactics as practices of "obfuscation" or "the deliberate addition of
ambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with
surveillance and data collection" in the time when we are "unable to
refuse or deny observation." They distinguish between several kinds of
obfuscation practices: selective and general, short-time and long-time,
and also those conducted in secret and others conducted openly: "For
some goals, for instance, obfuscation may not succeed if the adversary
knows that it is being employed; for other goals---such as collective
protest or interference with probable cause and production of plausible
deniability---it is better if the adversary knows that the data have
been poisoned" ("Introduction"). However, as Brunton and Nissenbaum
acknowledge, [the speed at which these practices become
**disempowered**]{.underline}, often [by way of corporate and state
power **appropriating revolutionary tactics** **as soon as they
emerge**]{.underline}, [is **astonishing**]{.underline}. In chapter 2,
[we identified this]{.underline} process [as the consequence of the
**troubling reciprocity** between surveillance and
mobilization]{.underline}, one of the typical features of the new type
of cyberwars. For example, **[Twitter]{.underline}**, a passive
surveillance platform for the Russian government during the Snow or
White-Ribbon Revolution in December 2011 (the protests against Russian
legislative election results), [was **fully weaponized** within a
**month**]{.underline}. By January 2012, the Twittersphere was
infiltrated by pro-government trolls countering critique of the fraud
election by massively disseminated praise for and sympathy with Putin;
"God save Putin" or "pointless protest" posts scored just as high as
"you are (the) movement," "Putin thief," or "be one white-ribbon"
(Spaiser et al. 2017, 139, 142), and "the use of Twitter bots" became "a
reliable technique for stifling Twitter discussions" (Brunton and
Nissenbaum 2015, "Core Cases").

How far the advice of digital self-defense programs is followed is,
moreover, dubious. As such programs usually acknowledge, [assessing the
**actual level** of security germane to **different types** of
activism]{.underline}, [treading a boundary between **carelessness** and
**paranoid grandiosity**]{.underline}, [is **challenging** and **highly
context dependent**]{.underline}. [Advanced security measures require
**careful attention** to use properly]{.underline}, [can be compromised
by **easy errors**]{.underline}, [are subject to **technical
failure**]{.underline}, [and can in and of themselves
**attract**]{.underline}, [rather than **deflect**]{.underline},
[attention]{.underline}. A recent report on [the **actual practices** of
social movement participants]{.underline} in the United Kingdom [is
**sobering**]{.underline} (Dencik, Hintz, and Cable 2016). Based on
interviews with activists, it finds that [while there is]{.underline},
post-Snowden, [a heightened awareness]{.underline} of surveillance,
[**very few** act on it]{.underline}. Many organizations are so deeply
reliant on networks and social media for "general awareness-raising,
advocacy, mobilizing, organizing and expanding their actions and
membership" that [introducing **new technological
practices**]{.underline}, [**always** in the context of **stretched
resources**]{.underline}, [is **extremely inconvenient** and **time
consuming**]{.underline}. Even when antisurveillance measures do not
require a level of expertise exclusive to "techies," [users inherit an
expectation of **seamless**]{.underline}, **[effortless
computing]{.underline}**, [particularly in **volatile situations**
requiring fast communication]{.underline}. [Activists may in crisis
situations **abandon** platforms known to be insecure and turn to
others]{.underline}, as they did in Egypt when protestors left Facebook
in favor of Signal (Mackey 2016). However, according to Dencik, Hintz,
and Cable (2016), in day-to-day life, the surveillance issue is most
often resolved by "selfregulating online behavior," such as "not saying
anything 'too controversial' on social media" or by assertion that an
organization has "nothing to hide." This latter assurance may be either
overconfident or an indication of panoptic political chill. It also
ignores the fact that ubiquitous surveillance has gone far beyond users'
verbal expression and use of keywords to the recordings of location,
chronology, and activity now embedded in our machines; for example,
those who attend a protest or are close to a terrorist attack will
always be the subjects of data that positions them in proximity to such
events.

Though Snowden's revelations have had an effect on popular percep - tion
of digital networks, their implications are easy to misrecognize. In
North America, they have been cynically played by the giants of digital
industry. After years of voluntarily complying with the NSA PRISM
surveillance program, providers of digital platforms and services
responded proactively to the new antisurveillance sentiment by offering
updated services with reinforced security features. This swerve has led
digital capital into some conflicts with state security, most notably in
the legal dispute between Apple and the FBI arising from the company's
refusal to construct a "backdoor" to undo the password on an iPhone5c
used in a 2015 terrorist attack (Zetter 2016a). Privacy activists
supported Apple, but before the case could go to court, the FBI paid to
crack the password with the help of an outside contractor (variously
reported as either a professional hacker or an Israeli cybersecurity
firm), thereby evading any legal showdown between the intelligence
agencies and their erstwhile corporate partners. Such contradictions
between free enterprise and the security apparatus that protects it may
create certain technological options for movement activists---at least
those who can afford the latest upgrades. However, [information
capital's new security consciousness **hijacks**]{.underline}
postSnowden [discourse to]{.underline} evade its larger implications. It
is intended to deter mass defection from mobile phone and social media,
[keep the public on the networks]{.underline}, and hence [within a field
where **big data**]{.underline} about habits, purchases, locations,
friends, and contacts [continue to be amassed]{.underline} by
corporations whose privacy assurances can and will be compromised by
voluntary or forced collaboration with state authorities---or
ingeniously bypassed.

[There are]{.underline}, therefore, [**serious limitations** to **purely
tactical**]{.underline}, [and **technical**]{.underline}, [**movement
adaptations** to the surveillance state]{.underline}. [An alternative is
**political** and **legal contestation**]{.underline} of surveillance.
In North America, [some of the **most important** of these challenges
come from **Afro-Americans**]{.underline}, **[First
Nations]{.underline}**, [and **Arab-Muslims**]{.underline},
[who]{.underline}, [on the basis of **collective historical
experience**]{.underline}, [point out how profiling systems at once
**constitute** and **control** specific suspect racialized social
groups]{.underline} (Kundnani and Kumar 2015), [demonstrating
how]{.underline} Virilio's "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**" [is
**most virulently applied** to the already colonized]{.underline}. In
many cases, [such challenges]{.underline} also [**point directly** to
the military aspects of racialized surveillance]{.underline}. Thus [the
digital tracking of]{.underline} **[B]{.underline}**lack
**[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter [activists and leaders
by both state agencies]{.underline} (Joseph 2015) [and private
cybersecurity firms]{.underline} (Buncombe 2015) stands as an extension
of the paramilitary combination of "stingray" mobile phone signaling
interceptions, drone observation, and information "fusion center"
cross-checking transferred from Middle Eastern wars to the policing of
Afro-American neighborhoods (Collins et al. 2015), practices that in
turn [build on a **lineage** of white vigilance rooted in fear of slave
revolt]{.underline} (Browne 2015). At the time of writing, two activist
groups, [the **Color of Change** and the **Center for Constitutional
Rights**]{.underline}, [are suing the **FBI**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the **[D]{.underline}**epartment of
**[H]{.underline}**omeland **[S]{.underline}**ecurity on the
surveillance of protests in eleven cities, arguing that it undermines
free speech while serving to "chill valuable public debate" (Timberg
2017).

In Dakota, the company **[TigerSwan]{.underline}**, founded by a former
U.S. special operations soldier, [was hired]{.underline} by Energy
Transfer Partners [to monitor]{.underline} the Sioux Nation's
**[Standing Rock]{.underline}** anti-oil pipeline
[protests]{.underline}. [It conducted]{.underline} radio, video aerial,
and social media [surveillance]{.underline} of protestors;
[shared intelligence]{.underline} with police; [and mounted online
campaigns]{.underline} to discredit the movement. [TigerSwan now faces
**civil suits**]{.underline} for operating a private security service
without a license (Brown 2017; Brown, Parrish, and Speri 2017). In
another case, [a coalition of activists]{.underline}, including
high-tech workers, [has protested]{.underline} the potential involvement
of Peter Thiel's software company **[Palantir]{.underline}** in building
a "Muslim database" to support Trump's promised "extreme vetting" of
immigrants (Woodman 2016; Buhr 2017). Palantir as a start-up benefited
from investment by CIA venture capital front company In-QTel and has a
record of work with the CIA, NSA, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Agency (Biddle 2017).

Over summer 2018, [a **remarkable wave** of technology-worker resistance
to military and militarized policing projects swept through Silicon
Valley]{.underline} (Tarnoff 2018). [At **Google**]{.underline},
[workers **successfully organized** to shut down **Project
Maven**]{.underline}, a Pentagon project that uses machine learning to
improve targeting for drone strikes. [Following this]{.underline},
[Google's CEO]{.underline}, Sundar Pichai (2018), [published a
statement]{.underline} of principles on AI development, [saying it would
not work on AI weapon or surveillance contracts]{.underline}, although
reserving the right to pursue cybersecurity projects. In June, [the
company withdrew its bid on a **\$10 billion** Pentagon
contract]{.underline} for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure
(Jedi) cloud computing project (BBC 2018f ). Meanwhile, [at
**Amazon**]{.underline}, [workers petitioned]{.underline} Jeff Bezos [to
stop selling]{.underline} the corporation's
**[Rekognition]{.underline}** facial identification software to U.S.
police departments and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
agency, notorious for its "zero-tolerance" enforcement policies (Conger
2018a). [At **Microsoft**]{.underline}, [workers]{.underline} similarly
[demanded the termination of a **\$19.4 million**]{.underline} cloud
computing [contract with **ICE**]{.underline} (Frenkel 2018), [and at
**Salesforce**]{.underline}, workers [tried to block]{.underline} the
company's [involvement with]{.underline} Customs and Border Protection
(**[CBP]{.underline}**).

[Other legal challenges]{.underline} to military-derived surveillance
[have come from individuals]{.underline}, such as the case launched by
David Carroll, in U.K. courts, against Cambridge Analytica, a former
military contractor that moved into the business of voter profiling.
Analytica is widely believed to have assisted the Trump campaign in
targeting ads to select voter groups during the 2016 election. Carroll's
case attempts to use British privacy law to compel Analytica to reveal
the basis on which his (and, by implication, other voters') personal
profile was constructed (Cadwalladr 2017a). [Such examples move
**beyond** digital self-defense toward]{.underline} what Dencik, Hintz,
and Cable (2016) call "[a **(re)conceptualization of resistance** to
surveillance on terms that can address the implications of this
data-driven form of governance in relation to **broader social justice
agendas**]{.underline}"---a broadening that, we suggest, should engage
other aspects of cyberwar as well. Before taking up this issue, however,
we look at another aspect of movement tactics on the battlefields of
cyberwar: the attempt to hack back.

### Cybernetics Good---2AC

#### Cybernetic innovation solves [extinction]{.underline} and [all their impacts]{.underline}---[humanities professors]{.underline} shouldn't be in charge of [nuclear silos]{.underline}. 

**Milne and Kinsella, 17**---Faculty of English, University of Cambridge
AND School of Media, Culture and Creative Arts, Faculty of Humanities,

CHEERS FOR DERRIDA," Angelaki, 22:3, 1-16, dml) \[language modifications
denoted by brackets, un-underlined portions of this card mention
self-harm\]

A further line of political deflection is the accelerationist strategy.
There are quasi-leftist accelerationists (Mackay and Avanessian). [We
should **take seriously** the proposition that [the **only way to save
the planet** is to **accelerate the pace of**]{.mark} **technological
[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On one view, the only way to save
the planet from global warming is by developing nuclear fusion
technology. This points down the pathway of the Hadron collider and big
science. But there is another acceleration that would decommission all
forms of nuclear technology, and rather than imitating the sun, seek
renewable forms of symbiosis with solar energy. A global diversion of
military and industrial resources into renewable and sustainable energy
forms would constitute a technological acceleration coupled with a
radical deceleration in fossil fuel consumption, perhaps even putting
the brakes on the fallacy of economic growth. What quickly emerges is
that [there are **choices to be made** across contested terrains. The
forms of acceleration are **political choices**, choices of **great
urgency**, but to **thematise**]{.underline} "acceleration" as such
[provides **scant critical purchase** on different forms]{.underline} of
acceleration. [What is [needed are **nuanced mediations** of the science
and tech]{.mark}nology **currently available**, along with **global
democratic decision making** on those technologies [we choose to
**accelerate** or **slow down**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another version of the "accelerationist" argument captures some of the
ideological workings of the term. In Marxist circles, an
"accelerationist" is someone who thinks that the collapse of capitalism
will be hastened by allowing reactionary forces [to **speed up
capitalism's self-destruction**]{.underline}. There are occasions when
such an argument has validity: nothing about the form of the argument
makes it inherently or structurally wrong. There are revolutionary
moments when allowing capitalism to collapse in order to rebuild a
socialist society is a better path than propping up a failing capitalist
regime. The judgement is political rather than philosophical. In most
contexts, however, the accelerationist argument, especially as a
political principle, [is **deeply dangerous**. [It would be
**better**]{.mark}, for example, [to **preserve a failing**]{.mark} **US
[capitalist regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} while building social forces
to take it over, [[than]{.mark} to [allow]{.mark} the [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} of the United States [to **fall into**]{.mark} **the
[hands of]{.mark} a**]{.underline} suicidal [**\[self-destructive\]
[military]{.mark} rearguard** [or]{.mark} some **counter-revolutionary
[terrorist]{.mark} organisation**. [Preserving]{.mark} the [possibility
of]{.mark} human [life **might involve propping up collapsing**
]{.mark}**capitalist [institutions]{.mark}**, not least [the **nuclear
safety inspectorate**]{.mark}, [rather than **allowing humanity to be
swallowed up** by some **death spiral** ]{.mark}**of presidential
dictators** in fear of being toppled. These are **critical judgements**
that could arise at **any moment**, with **real risks** that [poor
judgements]{.mark} will **[hasten]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark}
confrontation** that leads to **mutually assured
[annihilation]{.mark}**. The **formal shape** of an accelerationist
argument needs to be understood **strategically** and **politically** if
it is to address nuclear questions.]{.underline}

The accelerationist view that the deepening of capitalism could hasten
its self-destructive tendencies and lead to its collapse is not
inherently suicidal, but [[consideration of what]{.mark} the
[collapse]{.mark} of capitalism might [mean for]{.mark} the **global
stock of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **nuclear [power
stations]{.mark}** [indicates]{.mark} **dangers**]{.underline}. Amid the
collapse of capitalism, [**securing the [safety]{.mark} of nuclear
resources** [is a]{.mark} **fundamental priority**, and]{.underline}
preparing a decelerationist strategy is [[an **essential political
position**]{.mark} for **any radical formation** serious about nuclear
safety. Against the horizon of **nuclear crisis**, [we rely on workers
to **know** how to **manage** and **decommission**]{.mark} **nuclear
weapons**, **silos** and **power stations**]{.underline}. [This
requires]{.underline} "**[good]{.underline}**" [science]{.underline} and
ongoing struggles to control the decision making around weapons and
energy systems. [**Concrete consideration** of what happens to ageing
nuclear systems in an imploding political system has been **tested** in
the fall of the Soviet Union. Imagine the **retrenchment of reactionary
forces** around nuclear installations threatening]{.underline} suicidal
\[**[apocalyptic]{.underline}**\] [**political terrorism** on a **global
scale**. [The risks of]{.mark} a collapsing capitalist system **[taking
the world down]{.mark} with it** [are clear]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Chernobyl and Fukushima, moreover, stand as metonyms of the risks
involved in systems that were apparently functional and yet spiralled
out of control even in what might be called peacetime. The risks of the
US or the Chinese nuclear androids imploding involve different
decisions. Again, the need is for nuanced political judgements and
strategies, involving scientific expertise along with solidarity between
scientists, workers and new social formations.

The need for nuanced political engagement with "good" science suggests
some of the risks in any thematisation of science within archaic
philosophical paradigms. One form of nuclear denial is [the
[**reluctance to engage** with]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[concrete
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** of scientific knowledge,
[[preferring]{.mark} to retreat behind **the limited competence of the
[humanities scholar]{.mark}**. [It takes]{.mark} **some
[hubris]{.mark}**]{.underline} of philosophical interpretation [[to
suggest]{.mark} that **literary studies** can]{.underline} offer to
**[[understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** the fictional heart of
[[the]{.mark} nuclear [threat **despite knowing**]{.mark} **very
[little]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the [science and tech]{.mark}nology
involved. There will, **doubtless**, be **philosophical**,
**ontological** and **metaphysical questions** that science and
technology cannot answer]{.underline}. Nuclear arguments may carry
within their forms and conditions of possibility the illusions of
Western metaphysics, and decommissioning nuclear metaphors could turn
out to be as significant as criticising the public lies of nuclear
policy: but the nuclear android also imposes less philosophical
imperatives to engage with science, from medical science to nuclear
waste disposal, and through the critique of the political economy of the
nuclear android. [None of this suggests that metaphysics **should** or
**could be deleted**. [To **deflect engagement**]{.mark} with the
existing mess]{.underline} of the nuclear android [back into
**metaphysical** and **literary questions** nevertheless
[threatens]{.mark} to **evade the existing threats**, [not just]{.mark}
of [**nuclear annihilation** but]{.mark} of [**Indigenous rights**,
**environmental politics**, and]{.mark} the **raft of mediations** and
**[regulative practices]{.mark}** on which any amelioration of nuclear
damage **depends**]{.underline}. Nuclear war remains an imminent threat,
but so does the persistence of practices and strategies that contribute
to maintenance of the spectacle of the nuclear rather than its
disarmament and decommissioning. To reduce the problem to the "threat"
of nuclear war is to imagine that the actually existing industrial
behemoth of nuclear production is a fiction. It isn't. Nuclear weapons
testing and the history of nuclear accidents were not just fables, and
nor was the arms race a war of sophistry and rhetoric, however much
sophistry and rhetoric were deployed to disguise the ecocidal tendencies
of the nuclear android.

### Cybernetics Thesis=Wrong---2AC/1AR\*\*\*

#### \*\*\*Note while prepping: Do not read all of these cards in the 2AC (or 1AR)! You should familiarize yourself with them and pick and choose your favorite(s); I have included them in no particular order, with the exception that the first card (Dunn Cavelty and Wenger) is the only particularly topic-specific one.

#### Their link arguments are based on [deterministic oversimplifications]{.underline}. Emerging technologies are [too complex]{.underline} to fit under a single theoretical paradigm.

**Dunn Cavelty and Wenger, 22**---deputy head of research and teaching
at the Center for Security Studies, ETH Zurich; professor of
international and Swiss security policy at ETH Zurich and director of
the Center for Security Studies (Myriam and Andreas, "Introduction:
Cyber security between socio-technological uncertainty and political
fragmentation," *Cyber Security Politics: Socio-Technological
Transformations and Political Fragmentation*, Chapter 1, 5-6, dml)

Noting that [countermeasures need to be **drafted carefully** since our
understanding of the overall challenge is **incomplete at
best**]{.underline}, Schünemann passes the ball to the next chapter in
the volume. Based on the notions of cultural violence and cultural
peace, the chapter by Jasmin Haunschild, Marc-André Kaufhold, and
Christian Reuter shows the potential for political fragmentation through
social media, focusing on fake news and terrorist propaganda, and their
amplified dissemination through social bots. They show that [technology
plays an **ambiguous** role, on the one hand being an **amplifier** and
**enabler**]{.underline} of effects such as astroturfing and smoke
screening, [but on the **other** hand]{.underline} also enhancing social
bot detection. However, noting that [technology is **just one
aspect**]{.underline} in this issue area, the authors raise the
important point that [technical interventions **cannot address the root
causes** that make people spread or believe disinformation in the first
place]{.underline}. Their findings raise interesting questions about the
definition of victims and perpetrators of online structural violence.
They ask: "Are people who spread misinformation and propaganda
perpetrators of societal fragmentation and structural violence, or
victims of a society that has left them with low media literacy and the
feeling of being alienated by the society they live in?" (Haunschild et
al. 2022: 58). The more digital technologies become interwoven with
society and its general functioning, the harder will it be to isolate
them from the humans that use them.

The book then moves on [to look at new technological developments and
their current and future impact on]{.underline} cyber security
**[politics]{.underline}**. We look at three technological areas:
artificial intelligence/machine learning, quantum computing, and the
expansion of cyberspace into space. [In]{.underline} his chapter on
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence
[and]{.underline} the offense--defense balance in **[cyber
security]{.underline}**, Matteo Bonfanti provides an overview over the
debate about so-called artificial intelligence in cyber security
(Bonfanti 2022). It clarifies the concept of artificial intelligence
(AI) and shows in which security-related fields such tools are already
used. However, Bonfanti makes clear that [future projections are **very
hard** because the **actual usage** of new technologies depend on **too
many factors** that are **highly uncertain**.]{.underline} [What seems
clear]{.underline}, and reinforces the observation made in the previous
chapter, [is that despite the many uncertainties]{.underline} of how AI
will be used in the future, [it will benefit both the **defense** and
the **offense**]{.underline}. [Who will benefit more will **depend** on
the capacity of]{.underline} cyber security stakeholders in [the private
and the public section to **master** and **leverage**]{.underline} AI
[**technologies** for **specific purposes**]{.underline}. [This usage
will be **inevitably shaped** by]{.underline} the [models of
**governance** which will emerge from]{.underline} the formal/informal,
fragmented/ coordinated, and often unbalanced [interactions among public
authorities]{.underline}, [private organizations]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [civil society]{.underline}.

Following a similar path of reasoning, Jon R. Lindsay evaluates the
implications of quantum computing on cyber security and security more
generally (Lindsay 2022). The chapter shows that cryptology is shaped by
a paradoxical dynamic of cooperation-enabled competition in line with an
expanded play of intelligence and covert influence, with ambiguous
implications for strategic stability. Using the advent of quantum
computing as a thought experiment, the chapter tackles technologically
deterministic projections that are rampant in the field of cyber
security. In short, [if it were **true** that **technology determines
politics**]{.underline}, [then radical changes in technical
infrastructure should have **important**]{.underline}, [potentially
**equally radical** political consequences]{.underline}. Focusing on the
contest between code makers and code breakers against [the backdrop of
**political**]{.underline} logical, strategic **[context]{.underline}**,
[and **organizational implementation**]{.underline}, the chapter [shows
**convincingly** how such deterministic perspectives
**neglect**]{.underline} the **[social factors]{.underline}** that shape
secrecy and intelligence [**regardless** of the type of technology that
is involved]{.underline}. [Even though]{.underline} quantum [computing
is]{.underline} making this contest **[more complex]{.underline}**, [its
political implications are **far from predetermined**]{.underline}.

#### There is no overarching cybernetic episteme.

**Markland, 22**---Teaching Fellow in Politics and International
Relations at Aston University (Alistair, "Epistemic Transformation at
the Margins: Resistance to Digitalisation and Datafication within Global
Human Rights Advocacy," Global Society, 2022, Vol. 36, No. 1, 113-133,
dml)

As established in the first section of this article,
[proponents]{.underline} of what I have heuristically defined as the
"transformation thesis" [have emphasised the **revolutionary ruptures**
wrought by **digital connectivity** and **datafication**]{.underline}.
Some of these proponents illustrate these changes using field specific
case studies, as with Duffield's (2018) suggestion that the transition
to a "cybernetic episteme" is [reflected in]{.underline} humanitarian
practice. Other authors have taken a more abstract view, including
Chandler's (2018) [discussion of **new modes of governance** in the
digital era, or the post-humanist drive to reconceptualise]{.underline}
"**[humanity]{.underline}**" [under conditions of **technological
entwinement**]{.underline} (Cudworth and Hobden 2013). These assertions
of macro-level transformation are also supported by network sociology,
led principally by Manuel Castells (2010) analysis of how revolutions in
information technology, economic globalisation and an emergent "space of
flows" interact to produce a new kind of "network society". [This
linkage of societal transformation to economic forces is also
characteristic of **more critical anti-capitalist
perspectives**]{.underline}, [as with the Marxist critique
of]{.underline} "**[cognitive capitalism]{.underline}**"
(Moulier-Boutang 2012; Zukerfeld 2017). [Although these approaches
**differ** in their conceptual frameworks]{.underline}, [they are
**united** in their ambition to highlight **universal epistemic
transformations** brought about by **technological
change**]{.underline}.

[One of the **pitfalls** of these **totalising perspectives** is the
**neglect** of the **particular** in favour of the
**universal**]{.underline}. For instance, networked thinking encourages
assumptions about lateral transformation across socio-political fields
that are connected to the digital universe. But [**not all spheres** of
social or political activity move at the **same pace** when they are
exposed to technological innovation]{.underline}. [Datafication and
digitalisation are processes that have **uneven impacts** on different
social and political fields]{.underline}. For example, [the testimony
of]{.underline} Facebook's CEO Mark **[Zuckerberg]{.underline}** to the
Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees in April 2018, where US
lawmakers appeared confused by the social media giant's basic business
model, [is a **stark illustration** of the **gap** that still exists
between the world of **Big Tech** and the operating logics of
**mainstream democratic politics**]{.underline} (Stewart 2018). Bigo and
Bonelli (2019, 115) have found that [even in the field of
**transnational intelligence**]{.underline}, a sphere that could have
much to gain from algorithmic techniques, [technological expertise tends
to be **contracted out** to third parties while
**traditional**]{.underline}, [**human-sourced** intelligence approaches
remain **dominant**]{.underline}. Therefore, [grasping for totalising
processes risks **ignoring the empirical specificity** of divergent
social microcosms]{.underline}.

To remedy this blind side in transformationalist thinking, I assert the
utility of applying Pierre Bourdieu's field theory when conceptualising
how certain spheres of social or political activity---including the
field of global human rights advocacy discussed in the previous
section---mediate pressures for epistemic transformation and potentially
isolate technological changes and agents to the margins. Employing field
theory, Ole Jacob Sending (2015, 11) sees global governance as divided
into separate fields, where "actors compete with each other to be
recognised as authorities on what is to be governed, how, and why".
Examples of such fields include international development, security,
peacebuilding, humanitarianism, and human rights advocacy. However, each
field varies in terms of its specific "rules of the game" (Bourdieu and
Waquant 1992, 99). Fields are bounded, game-like social structures that
are constituted by a unique constellation of actors. These actors
struggle for authority according to the field's principles of
legitimation (Bourdieu 1989, 17). These principles of legitimation,
which define a field's cultural capital, are durable to the extent that
dominant actors remain invested in their reproduction. Actors' prolonged
immersion in these fields subsequently shapes their own practical
sensibilities, so that the field's logics are internalised as common
sense within the habitus (Bourdieu 1990, 53). It is the embedment of the
field's doxa (common sense) within the habitus of invested actors that
makes fields durable and resistant to radical transformations. As seen
in the previous section, the rules governing the human rights field are
associated with its logic of political influence, persuasion, and moral
authority.

Critics of Bourdieusian field theory have argued that it is overly
structuralist, reproductive, and cannot grasp "the ever-shifting
constellations of actors, institutions, data and forms of expression
that make up the expertise" (Waever and Leander 2018, 2). However,
alternative approaches such as actor-network theory or assemblage-based
theories fail to centralise the importance of social and political
struggles between agents which are key in defining the trajectory of
digitalisation and datafication. As Ruppert, Isin, and Bigo (2017, 3),
"\[d\]ata does not happen through unstructured social practices but
through structured and structuring fields in and through which various
agents and their interests generate forms of expertise, interpretation,
concepts, and methods that collectively function as fields of power and
knowledge". Similarly, "data is not an already given artefact that
exists (which then needs to be mined, analysed, brokered) but an object
of investment (in the broadest sense) that is produced by the
competitive struggles of professionals who claim stakes in its meaning
and functioning" (Bigo, Isin, and Ruppert 2019, 11). Technological
change can influence the trajectory of different global political fields
by enabling the entry of new types of actors (such as data consultants
in the case of human rights advocacy), as well as by producing emergent
sources of cultural capital and associated epistemic practices (such as
expertise in geospatial imaging).

As Bigo and Bonelli (2019, 120) have observed in the case of the
transnational intelligence field, technological change can be
accompanied by the growing influence of private companies who "have
played a substantial role in the recruitment of IT specialists, network
engineers, data analysts, integration platform software designers,
language and coding specialists, cryptologists, and mathematicians
tasked with creating or combining algorithms". Such entryism can have a
revolutionary effect if those new actors are able redefine a field's
organising logic, cultural capital, and principles of legitimation. For
example, looking at the case of Sudan in the 1990s as an antecedent to
the transformation of humanitarianism, Duffield (2018, 85) traces how
donor governments asserted greater control over NGOs, who subsequently
"seamlessly morphed into the 'implementing partners' of donor
governments". Alongside growing private sector partnerships, these
developments stimulated the neoliberal re-alignment of the humanitarian
field away from Third World solidarity and the progressive support for
autonomous change and towards the governance of precarity. This exposed
the field to an epistemic transformation that privileged datafication
based on a "surveillance logic of command and control" (ibid., 168).

However, [**not all** global political fields are]{.underline} so
[**structurally conducive** to]{.underline} this kind of **[radical
transformation]{.underline}**. The example of the human rights advocacy
field illustrates how [a strong autonomous organising
logic]{.underline}---a logic [of
**persuasion**]{.underline}---[generates entrenched forms of
**field-specific** cultural capital]{.underline}---qualitative and
humanistic accounts of raw suffering [that establish
**clear**]{.underline} legal **[responsibilities]{.underline}**. [Actors
can **mobilise** digital or data infrastructures to **diversify** the
range of tools and media at their disposal]{.underline}, as illustrated
by the (limited) use of geospatial technology, data visualisations in
human rights reporting, and a growing reliance on social media platforms
to engage audiences. [However]{.underline}, [they **do not necessarily
threaten**]{.underline} the **[epistemic practices]{.underline}** that
are at the centre of human rights advocacy. This is because [the
**transformative potential** of new technologies and methods **depends**
on their]{.underline} epistemic, political, social, or moral [**value**
in the eyes of the fields' **dominant actors**]{.underline}. [The
integration of data-based approaches has been one of **slow
adaptation**]{.underline}, **[not revolution]{.underline}**, [and
technological specialists]{.underline}---often employed as third-party
consultants rather than as full-time human rights
professionals---[remain at the **margins**]{.underline}. The
Bourdieusian concept of habitus is also helpful in illuminating how
fields with strong professional structures and specific educational and
career trajectories can endow members with enduring dispositions that
favour both the reproduction of existing epistemic practices and
resistance to new ones. The habitus of human rights professionals is
still primarily defined by legal, journalistic, and liberal-cosmopolitan
moral/political dispositions, rather than technological expertise. So
long as processes of doxic reproduction remain stable, the potential for
epistemic transformation through datafication remains limited.

Conclusion

This article has cautioned against the analytical trend towards treating
datafication as a general process acting to radically transform the
epistemic and governance practices across global political fields.
[Because different social and political fields are **unique social
microcosms** that contain **divergent organising
principles**]{.underline}, readers should [be **wary** of post-humanist
analyses making **totalising claims** about alleged transformations in
the human condition]{.underline}. [The **polemical teleology** of
transformationalism]{.underline}, an approach that is in vogue among
Silicon Valley hype merchants like Elon Musk, public intellectuals, and
a growing number of social scientists, [is certainly **attention
grabbing**]{.underline}, [but it **does not measure up** against the
**actual way** in which technological]{.underline} and methodological
[innovations are instituted within **different fields** of
practice]{.underline}. International relations and global governance
[scholars working on the interstitial cross-roads between technology
and]{.underline} various political or [social lifeworlds need to be
**attentive** to how digital and data transformations are mediated at
the meso level of **global politics**]{.underline}. This article has
demonstrated how epistemic transformation can be resisted at the meso
level through observing changes and continuities among elite human
rights organisations. Bourdieusian field theory, with its emphasis on
legitimacy, social reproduction, and the durability of practical
dispositions, offers a suitable framework for conceptualising the
absence of epistemic rupture within the field of human rights advocacy.
However, [because digitalisation and datafication processes are mediated
through the **specific logics** of a given field]{.underline}, more work
needs to be done on examining how different organising principles shape
the potentialities for epistemic transformation. Thus, in the future,
more [**comparative empirical research** will be needed to observe
technological changes across **different areas** of global
governance]{.underline}.

#### They have it backwards. "Technology does not determine politics; often it is the other way round."

**Lindsay, 22**---associate professor at the School of Cybersecurity and
Privacy and Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia
Institute of Technology (Jon, "Quantum computing and classical politics:
The ambiguity of advantage in signals intelligence," *Cyber Security
Politics: Socio-Technological Transformations and Political
Fragmentation*, Chapter 6, 90-91, dml)

**[Technology does not determine politics]{.underline}**; [often it is
the **other way round**]{.underline}. [Scholars]{.underline} of cyber
security (or quantum computing) [must understand the **details**
of]{.underline} information [technology]{.underline}, [just as scholars
of]{.underline} international [political economy need to understand the
**technical nuances** of central banking]{.underline}. [But they
must]{.underline} then [go **further** to interrogate the **social
context** and **constitution**]{.underline} of these technologies.
[Technology can **at most** alter the value of a variable in some theory
about some political outcome]{.underline}, [such as **conflict
onset**]{.underline}, **[escalation]{.underline}**,
**[duration]{.underline}**, [or **termination**]{.underline}. [But that
variable will **almost always** be conditioned on **other social
factors** including organizational doctrine]{.underline},
[administrative structure]{.underline}, [national culture]{.underline},
[or elite politics]{.underline}. Through this project, it became
apparent to me that the real problem was not that IR lacked an
understanding of quantum computing, but that it had little to say about
cryptology of any generation. Likewise for cyber security, I have come
to believe that the problem is less that IR does not understand
information technology and more that IR has only recently started to
seriously study intelligence phenomena (Jervis 2011; Rovner 2011; Carson
2018; O'Rourke 2018; Rid 2020). The field is wide open for
[IR]{.underline} to examine the secret side of politics, which
increasingly involves the exploitation of information technology. Social
scientists [**can** and **should** **reclaim technology from the
technologists**]{.underline}.

#### Life isn't determined by cybernetics.

**Susen, 20**---Reader in Sociology at the School of Arts and Social
Sciences of City, University of London (Simon, "No escape from the
technosystem?," Philosophy & Social Criticism, Vol 46, Issue 6, 2020,
dml)

A major irony of Feenberg's book is the following contradiction: on
several occasions, he criticizes, and distances himself from,
technological determinism; key parts of his argument suggest, however,
that he himself flirts with, if not subscribes to, technological
determinism. He rightly maintains, and convincingly demonstrates, that
'society and technology are inextricably imbricated'.240 This insight
justifies [the underlying assumption that there is **no comprehensive
study of society** without a **critical sociology of
technology**]{.underline}. Yet, to contend that '\[s\]ocial groups exist
through the technologies that bind their members together'241 [is
**misleading**. For **not all social groups are primarily defined** by
the technologies that enable their members to relate to, and to bond
with, one another]{.underline}. Indeed, [**not all social relations**,
or **social bonds**, are **based on**, let alone **determined by**,
**technology**]{.underline}. [Of course]{.underline}, Feenberg is right
to argue that ['technologically mediated groups **influence technical
design** through their choices and protests']{.underline}.242
Ultimately, though, the previous assertion is tautological. This becomes
clear if, in the above sentence, we replace the word 'technological(ly)'
with terms such as 'cultural(ly)', 'linguistical(ly)', 'political(ly)',
'economic(ally)', or indeed another sociological qualifier commonly used
to characterize the specificity of a social relation. Hence, we may
declare that 'culturally, linguistically, politically, and economically
mediated groups influence cultural, linguistic, political, and economic
conventions through their choices and protests'. [In saying so, we are
**stating the obvious**. If]{.underline}, however, [we aim to make a
case for]{.underline} cultural, linguistic, political, or economic
[**determinism**, then this is **problematic** to the extent that we end
up **reducing the constitution of social arrangements** to the product
of **one overriding causal set of forces**]{.underline} (whether these
be cultural, linguistic, political, economic, technological, or
otherwise). While declaring that he is a critic of technological
determinism, Feenberg -- in central passages of his book -- gives the
impression that he is one of its fiercest advocates. Feenberg's
techno-Marxist evolutionism is based on the premise that 'progress is
realized essentially through technosystem change'243 -- that is, on the
assumption that, effectively, human progress is reducible to
technological development. Feenberg is right to stress that
'\[t\]echnical progress is joined indissolubly to the democratic
enlargement of access to its benefits and protection from its harms'.244
'Concretization',245 understood in this way, conceives of progress as a
'local, context-bound phenomenon uniting technical and normative
dimensions'.246 We may add, however, that [progress has **not only
technical** (or **technological**) but also **economic**, **cultural**,
and **political dimensions**, which contain **objective**,
**normative**, and **subjective facets**. At times, the
**differentiation** between these aspects is **blurred**, if not
**lost**, in]{.underline} Feenberg's account, given his [tendency to
**overstate the power of technology** at the expense of **other crucial
social forces**]{.underline}. In other words, [progress is not only
'**inextricably entangled** with the **technosystem**']{.underline},247
[but it is also **indissolubly entwined** with the **economic**,
**cultural**, and **political systems** in which it unfolds and for (or
against) which it exerts its]{.underline} objective, normative, and
subjective [power]{.underline}. The preceding reflection takes us back
to the problem of techno-reductionism: The struggle over the
technosystem began with the labor movement. Workers' demands for health
and safety on the job were public interventions into production
technology.248 [All struggles over social (sub)systems have **not only a
technological** but also **various other** (notably **economic**,
**cultural**, and **political**) **dimensions**. Demands made by
particular subjects]{.underline} (defined by class, ethnicity, gender,
age, or ability -- or a combination of these sociological variables)
[are **commonly expressed** in public interventions **not only
into**]{.underline} production [**technology**, but also into
**economic**, **cultural**, and **political systems**. In all social
struggles]{.underline} (including class struggle), [technology can be an
**important means to an end**, but it is **rarely an end in
itself**]{.underline}. Put differently, [social struggles are **partly**
-- but **seldom essentially**, let alone **exclusively** -- **about
technology**]{.underline}.

#### Oversimplification is [offense]{.underline}. Totalizing theories of restrictive cybernetic power can't account for its [positive]{.underline} deployments---the more exceptions to their theory, the less the alt solves.

**Williams, 15**---Lecturer in Digital Media & Society, School of
Politics, Philosophy, Language and Communication Studies, University of
East Anglia; at time of authorship, Ph.D. candidate, University of East
London (Alex, "Control Societies & Platform Logic," New Formations,
84/85, pp. 209-227, dml)

Having established how a restrictive cybernetic vision of control might
operate, [we are]{.underline} now [in a position to mount a **critique**
to point towards what such a picture of contemporary power
**ignores**]{.underline}. [In cleaving to an understanding of power as
**basically restrictive**]{.underline}, [cybernetic control is largely
focused on the ways in which decentralised systems **contain** and
**limit** behaviour]{.underline}. From this perspective, at least, the
control society operates as a system of complexly articulated
homeostats, modulating and constraining behaviours towards accepted
goals. The relatively primitive [forms of feedback]{.underline} offered
by disciplinary panopticons [have become]{.underline} vastly more
sophisticated, dynamic, mobile, **[omnipresent]{.underline}**, [and
operative on a **personal** or even **sub-personal level**]{.underline}.
[Yet these remain **primarily negative** in nature]{.underline} ([even
if targeting goals which are themselves dynamic]{.underline}, as when
the goal is a set rate of change). What [this **leaves
out**]{.underline} is [the dimension of decentralised power which is
**not merely restrictive**]{.underline}, (or goal-oriented)
[but]{.underline} which is [also **constructive**]{.underline}. On the
one hand, this constructive aspect refers to the ways in which control
[systems **positively construct** as well as **negatively constrict**
action]{.underline} -- [they make things **possible** that would
otherwise be **impossible**]{.underline}. On the other hand, it is also
to point towards the fact that [cybernetic visions of control have a
tendency to **ignore** the ground of such decentralised
power]{.underline}, [the **very means** by which it might be
**constituted**]{.underline}, [and hence also **modified**]{.underline}.
For example, [we might ask **why** it is that certain kinds of control
systems predominate over others]{.underline}.

To put this another way: there may well be a more interesting
relationship between constraint and enablement, and hence between
necessity and contingency, than control is often taken to indicate. As
we argue below, the immense power of control rests not just in its
ability to modulate behaviour via homeostatic dynamics, to target goals
which are known in advance, but also in its ability to relatively
constrain an open-ended range of contingent behaviours, which cannot be
identified in advance. These contingent behaviours, enabled and
constrained by the control systems within which they operate, work also
to reinforce the power of the control systems themselves, in a
conspiracy between closedness and openness, constriction and
construction. It is this relationship, and its increasing
operationalisation by business and governmental organisations, that
constitutes the real power of control, a power we will describe under
the name of the platform.

[More than an issue of **mere theoretical dispute**]{.underline}, [there
are **important practical implications** for how we are to **consider
possible resistance** to the operations of cotemporary
power]{.underline}. For [if we **misunderstand the nature**
of]{.underline} control's [power]{.underline}, then [we will also be
**likely to misapprehend the correct measures necessary to
oppose**]{.underline}, **[transform]{.underline}** **[or supplant
it]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} also [goes some way to explaining
why it is that the strategic responses often offered]{.underline} in
response to the control society [have been **relatively
paltry**]{.underline} ([and largely focused on **hacking**]{.underline},
**[spreading viruses]{.underline}**, [or otherwise **disrupting** or
**evading** existing control systems]{.underline}).43

### Framework---2AC

#### Framework: The negative must prove that the [consequences]{.underline} of the plan are [uniquely worse]{.underline} than the status quo or a [solvent alternative]{.underline}. 

#### The impact is [competitive clash]{.underline}. Any lower burden for the negative creates a [strategic incentive]{.underline} to avoid [leaning into]{.underline} the controversy through [nuanced]{.underline}, [well-researched neg strats]{.underline} in favor of "[you-link-you-lose]{.underline}" frameworks or [unpredictable utopian alts]{.underline} that affs can't effectively prep for. Competitive clash is the [intrinsic good]{.underline} of debate---it's the [distinguishing feature]{.underline} of the activity and an [essential part]{.underline} of whatever broader purposes that it might serve.

#### Debates about NATO cooperation on emerging tech are [good]{.underline}. Security cooperation [isn't]{.underline} always logistically-minded; NATO can make [valuable]{.underline} political and ethical contributions when [effectively coordinated]{.underline}.

Chapter 10, 96-97, dml)

In this respect, [one of the **most important questions** Allies should
ask]{.underline} themselves [is **what they want AI to
do**]{.underline}. [This is not just a **military** or **defense
question**]{.underline}: [this is a **political** and]{.underline}
probably [**ethical issue** since there is a **wide spectrum** of
views]{.underline}, [sensitivities and perceptions
involved]{.underline}. [**Important debates** about arms control or data
governance are]{.underline} ultimately [**connected** to these broader
issues]{.underline}. **[Some]{.underline}** Allies [may
want]{.underline} to use AI [**just to optimize logistics** and
**increase efficiency** in the **management of**]{.underline} various
**[NATO activities]{.underline}**. Others may see it widely used at a
tactical level, particularly with intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance functions. [**Others** may be looking at]{.underline}
integrating AI into their force structure with a **[more ambitious
visions]{.underline}**, somehow recalling the revolution in military
affairs approach.

Against this backdrop, [a **debate** about]{.underline} AI-related
[**ethics** in the defense domain is **paramount**]{.underline}, not
only to reach a consensus among Allies but also to strengthen the
political bonds of the Alliance. [From this **starting
point**]{.underline}, [NATO can play an **important role** in **other
domains**]{.underline}. In some cases, like standardizations, [NATO has
**historically** been an important player]{.underline}, [and should make
further steps]{.underline} also [to prevent **interoperability
problems** due to]{.underline} a **[fragmented adoption]{.underline}**
of AI. In other instances, [some **creativity** may be
needed]{.underline}: for instance, [should NATO provide **cloud
computing services**]{.underline}, namely enablers, [the same way it
provides **airspace management**]{.underline} -- through Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircrafts -- [or **ground
surveillance**]{.underline} -- through the Alliance Ground Surveillance
(AGS) program? [Could NATO envision an **integration** of
nationally-owned AI assets]{.underline} as it does with the integrated
air and missile defense? [These are **important questions**
which]{.underline}, however, [highlight]{.underline} the fact [that
defense is a **sovereign** issue and most decisions are taken by
**national governments**]{.underline}, not by NATO as such.

### Link Answers---AI---2AC/1AR

#### AI isn't intrinsically violent and refusing it fails.

**Huq, 22**---Frank and Bernice J. Greenberg Professor of Law at the
University of Chicago Law School (Aziz, "Can We Democratize AI?,"
<https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/can-we-democratize-ai>,
dml)

For readers unfamiliar with [the]{.underline} critical literature on AI,
Crawford's book provides a powerful, elegantly written synopsis. Her
criticisms bite hard against the self-serving discourse of Silicon
Valley. Yet I wonder whether her [**unqualified insistence** that AI
serves]{.underline} "[systems that further **inequality** and
**violence**]{.underline}" [**obscures** at the same time as it
illuminates]{.underline}. If [data-based prediction]{.underline}, as I
learned as a teenager, [has been around a **long time**]{.underline},
[**how** and **when** did it become]{.underline} such an
**[irremediable]{.underline}** problem[?]{.underline}

More than a decade ago, the historian David Edgerton's The Shock of the
Old repudiated the notion that the future would be dematerialized,
weightless, and electronic. Edgerton insisted on the endurance of old
tools---diesel-powered ships carrying large metal containers, for
example---as central components of neoliberal economic growth. It is a
mistake, he suggested, to view our present deployments of technology as
a function of innovation alone, free from the influence of inherited
technological forms and social habits.

Crawford underscores pressing contemporary concerns about resource
extraction, labor exploitation, and state violence. But [has AI
made]{.underline} these [problems **worse**]{.underline}---[or are
current crises]{.underline}, as Edgerton's analysis hints, [just the
**enduring shock waves** created by **old** technologies and
practices]{.underline}? [It's **not at all clear**]{.underline}.
[Crawford]{.underline}, for instance, justly [criticizes the energy
consumption of new data centers]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} she
[gives **no accounting** of the preceding history of data harvesting and
storage **unconnected** to AI]{.underline}. As a result, [it is
**unclear** whether novel forms of AI have **changed**
global]{.underline} rates of energy [consumption and]{.underline}, if
so, [by **what extent**]{.underline}. [**Nor** is it clear whether
commercial AI is **more** or **less amenable** to reform than its
predecessors]{.underline}. One of the leading scholarly articles on AI's
carbon footprint proposes a number of potential reforms, including the
possibility of switching to already-available tools that are more energy
efficient. And [recent **empirical work**]{.underline}, published after
Atlas of AI, [shows that the energy consumption of major network
providers]{.underline} such as Telefonica and Cogent
**[decreased]{.underline}** in absolute terms between 2016 and 2020,
[even as data demands **sharply rose**]{.underline}.

Similarly, Crawford's [analysis of the labor market]{.underline} for
AI-related piecework [**does not engage** with the question of whether
new technologies change workers' **reservation wage**]{.underline}---the
lowest pay rate at which a person will take a particular kind of
job---and hence their proclivity to take degrading and harmful work. [It
isn't clear whether AI firms are lowering what is already a **very
lean** reservation wage or merely using labor that would otherwise be
exploited in a **similar way**]{.underline}. Crawford underscores the
"exhausting" nature of AI-related labor---the fourteen-hour shifts that
leave workers "totally numb." But [long]{.underline}, [boring shifts
have characterized capitalist production since the **eighteenth
century**]{.underline}; [we **cannot know** whether AI is making workers
worse off simply by **flagging the persistence** of these
conditions]{.underline}.

In Crawford's narrative, [AI is fated to **recapitulate the worst
excesses** of capitalism while escaping even the **most strenuous
efforts** at democratic regulation]{.underline}. Her
[critique]{.underline} of Silicon Valley determinism ends up resembling
its photographic negative. Crawford here devotes few words to the most
crucial question: can we democratize AI? Instead, she [calls for
a]{.underline} "**[renewed politics of refusal]{.underline}**" by
"national and international movements that refuse technology-first
approaches and focus on addressing underlying inequities and
injustices."

[It's **hard to disagree**]{.underline} with the idea of fighting
"underlying inequities and injustice." [But it's **not
clear**]{.underline} what her slogan means [for the **future use** of
AI]{.underline}. [Consider]{.underline} the use of AI in
**[breast-cancer detection]{.underline}**. AI diagnostic tools have been
available at least since 2006; the best presently achieve more than 75
percent accuracy. No difference has been observed in accuracy rates
between races. In contrast, the (non-AI) pulse oximeter that found
sudden fame as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool does yield sharp racial
disparities. AI diagnostics for cancer certainly have costs, even
assuming adequate sensitivity and specificity: privacy and trust may be
lost, and physicians may de-skill. [Returning to non-AI
tools]{.underline}, though, **[will not necessarily
eliminate]{.underline}** "[**inequities** and
**injustice**]{.underline}."

But [do these problems warrant a]{.underline} "**[politics of
refusal]{.underline}**"[?]{.underline} It would, of course, be a problem
if accurate diagnostic AI were available only for wealthy (or white)
patients; but [is it a safe assumption that every new technology will
**reproduce extant distributions** of wealth or social
status]{.underline}? [AI tools are often adopted under conditions that
reinforce]{.underline} old forms of exploitation and
[domination]{.underline} or generate new ones. [This is true of **many
technologies**]{.underline}, however, from the cotton gin to the
Haber-Bosch process. [But cheaper cancer detection is just one of **many
possible examples** of AI technologies that could **expand** the
availability of services **previously restricted** to
elites]{.underline}. [An understanding of new AI technologies' social
potential demands **not just**]{.underline} Edgerton's
**[skepticism]{.underline}** about novelty, that is, [but an openness to
**ambiguity** and **contradiction** in how tools **can** or **should**
be used]{.underline}---[a politics of **progressive
repossession**]{.underline}, and **[not just refusal]{.underline}**.

Crawford's [critiques of the damaging uses and effects of AI raise
**important questions** about technological change under contemporary
social conditions]{.underline}. Yet, by [**sidelining** issues of
**historical continuity** and the **potential beneficial uses** of new
tools]{.underline}, she [leaves us with an **incomplete picture** of
AI]{.underline}, [and **no clear path forward**]{.underline}. Atlas of
AI begins a conversation then---but leaves plenty more to be said.

#### No single paradigm can explain the political essence of human-AI interactions.

**Metcalfe, et al, 16**---research kinesiologist with the U.S. DEVCOM
Army Research Laboratory (Jason, with Brandon Perelman, David Boothe,
and Kaleb McDowell, "Systemic Oversimplification Limits the Potential
for Human-AI Partnership," IEEE Access, Volume 4, 2016, dml)

[As AI and AI-related technologies are integrated into our
lives]{.underline}, [the methods for **introducing** them]{.underline},
[as well as for **effectively integrating** them with our
society]{.underline}, [have been the source of
**involved**]{.underline}, **[long-term debate]{.underline}**. Such
debates can be found at least as early as the 1930's \[7\], with
specific discussions about designing effective \"man-machine systems\"
\[8\] published the same year that also welcomed the first robot into
existence \[9\]. Since then, [**varied frameworks have** been promoted
for]{.underline} systematically defining roles and responsibilities in
[human-machine interactions]{.underline} \[10\]--\[19\], [indicating
that there is **still no established** and **broadly accepted correct
method** for]{.underline} achieving [integration in all
situations]{.underline}. Part of the reason for this apparent lack of
consensus, we argue, is that [the core research community is
**exceptionally diverse**]{.underline}. [Whether hardware
specialists]{.underline}, [algorithm developers]{.underline}, [human
factors engineers]{.underline}, [creative designers]{.underline},
[business professionals]{.underline}, [technology transition
managers]{.underline}, [marketing specialists]{.underline}, [or
end-users]{.underline}, [**most parts of society** are playing a
role]{.underline} in this exciting global transformation. While the
combined expertise of multidisciplinary teams is needed, [the
**diverse** and **specialized perspectives** that individuals bring to
the table can make it **difficult** to form a **shared
vision**]{.underline} \[20\]. In these highly multidisciplinary
ventures, limitations on language and differences in training and
priorities can systematically perpetuate oversimplifications that are
then commonly shared among stakeholders across technical literacy
barriers \[21\].

In the present paper we offer our perspective on this circumstance by
first establishing a backdrop of three oversimplified assumptions about
the human-AI relationship, and we go on to offer a theoretical construct
that we have developed to facilitate collaborative discourse about
strategies to integrate this class of technologies into new intelligent
sociotechnical ecosystems with humans. The ultimate aim is to expand the
global discussion around how we, as a society, may form effective
human-AI partnerships. We have selected a few
**[oversimplifications]{.underline}** that, like others, [seem to arise
from viewing human-AI interactions as **monolithic**]{.underline}, using
a single construct for understanding division of labor. Rather, we argue
that [the **fundamental nature** of future human-AI partnerships is
**task relative**]{.underline}, depending on the certainty of
information forming the basis of the problem, the amount of time
available to resolve the situation, and, most critically (and most often
ignored), task complexity.

As AIs become more advanced, our patterns of interaction with them may
be expected to progress as well. Moving our vision away from the more
clearly differentiated, and simpler, roles that exist between craftsman
and tool, we anticipate that [far more complex and interdependent
dynamics will emerge as humans and AIs are brought into intelligent
ecosystems]{.underline} enabled by varied team-like partnerships and
interaction dynamics \[22\], \[23\]. Viewing interactions between AI and
humans in the context of certainty, time, and complexity should clearly
emphasize the reality that [there is **not one sort** of interaction
that must be considered]{.underline} and supported. Rather, [as with
large social systems]{.underline}, [there are **myriad ways** that
humans and AIs may cooperate or compete]{.underline}. Therefore, [**no
single paradigm** will appropriately address the question of how best to
integrate the two]{.underline}. The growing community of interest around
human-AI teaming must, we argue, come to agreement on how to address the
problem space, as well as how we convey important understandings about
it; here, it is our aim to offer the theoretical construct that we call
the landscape of human-AI partnership to support these goals.

[NATO has]{.underline} an interest, and [a **moral
obligation**]{.underline}, [to **promote the adoption** of its values
in]{.underline} the realm of **[AI]{.underline}**. [Democratic values
inform the Alliance's goals]{.underline}, thus [giving meaning to its
material capabilities]{.underline} -- [including its military
power]{.underline}. At the same time, [the integration of AI
into]{.underline} the fields of [security and defence poses **unique
moral**]{.underline}, **[ethical]{.underline}**,
**[legal]{.underline}**, [and **safety-related
questions**]{.underline}.85 [It is]{.underline} thus [**imperative**
that the Alliance **actively considers** and **operationalizes** AI
ethics]{.underline}, [**regardless** of the **degree** and **scope of AI
integration** within NATO and its Allies]{.underline}. The common
principles and values pronounced in the Atlantic Treaty represent the
foundations on which NATO was built. Such principles and values --
democracy, freedom, rule of law, individual rights, free markets -- are
the bond underlying the transatlantic community, which in fact predates
the Atlantic Alliance.86

[Norms and values can **strongly shape** the international
system]{.underline}.87 [Given the **intense international competition**
in the technological]{.underline}, [military]{.underline},
[economic]{.underline}, [and normative domains]{.underline}, embedding
democratic values into AI is as much a strategic imperative for the
Alliance as it is a functional one.88 [In addition to **signalling to
domestic populations** that NATO and its Allies **follow through** on
their commitments]{.underline} to uphold values as the basis of the
political and military Alliance, [**incorporating AI ethics** into
the]{.underline} "**[NATO-mation]{.underline}**" [agenda]{.underline}
also [serves as a **bulwark** against the incursion of **unwelcome
illiberal values** in the course of future technological
development]{.underline}.89

It is worth noting that NATO's role in the AI ethics sphere differs from
that of many other organizations, such as national governments and the
European Union, because [NATO is not a regulatory body]{.underline}.
NATO complies with existing laws and regulations, including the Laws of
War, which nations and the international community created. This means
that regulatory and normative questions such as the development and
deployment of autonomous weapons systems will not be determined at NATO
level. Nevertheless, [there is still room for NATO to **play a clear
role**]{.underline}. Indeed, given doubts and worries about the adoption
of AI for military purposes, [NATO can help generate **more public
support** and **engagement** by clearly defining ethical boundaries and
moral guidelines]{.underline}.

The uses of AI in military operations -- ranging from logistics to
maintenance, from recruitment to retainment, from intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance to medical tests and medical evacuation,
and more90 -- go beyond the discussions on lethal autonomous weapons
systems that have dominated European debate about AI in military
affairs. Accordingly, the range of ethical questions relevant to NATO
extend beyond focusing on the tip of the spear. [**Seemingly mundane
uses** of AI]{.underline}, such as in human resources or decision
support, [can still pose **distinct ethical questions** the Alliance
should be prepared to handle]{.underline}. [Addressing **security
risks**]{.underline},91 [minimizing **bias**]{.underline} in systems,92
[developing **trust**]{.underline},93 [and respecting **privacy** are
fundamental tasks for the Alliance to **ensure the future
effectiveness** of AI]{.underline}, whether in battle or in other
functions.

### Link Answers---Biotech---2AC/1AR

#### Biotech is [inevitable]{.underline}---the cat's out of the bag. Engaging the state through advocating [proactive regulation]{.underline} is the [only way]{.underline} to prevent their impacts.

**Hasner, 17**---Leiden University Medical Centre (Mira, "GENETIC
ENGINEERING REQUIRES A HEEDFUL EYE,"

[Genetic knowledge enables manipulation and enhancement of human nature.
Transgenic organisms and human gene sequences have been **patented for
clinical use**, thus causing an **enormous growth in biotechnology**.
Recent innovations have made it possible to **remove** and to **replace
unwanted genes**, enhancing human genetic traits. But **where will
humanity draw the line** once this is **implemented in the healthcare
system**]{.underline} and becomes societal norm? If a child is immune to
HIV, why not supply him/her with excellent eyesight and increased
intelligence too? Genetic engineering prefers moulding nature over
beholding nature, which is threatening to banish appreciation of life
and its flaws.\[2\] Will the ethical barrier between curing and
enhancing people be enough to prevent people from creating post-human
species?

One of the newest developments in biotechnology is CRISPR-cas9. CRISPR
stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. It
consists of short segments of repetitive prokaryotic DNA-codes, which
can be seen as a huge DNA-library with built-in nucleotide fragments of
an aggressive virus, called spacer DNA. Bacteriophages are viruses that
attack bacteria by inserting its own DNA into cytoplasm, thus resulting
in a take-over of protein- and DNA-synthesis. Cas9 are the RNA-guided
DNA endonucleases that function as scissors in recognizing and cutting
out viral DNA. Bacteria that survive this attack store the viral DNA in
the CRISPR-library. Cas9 then scans the bacterial DNA for matches with
the spacer DNA and destroys the recognized invading viruses. This
mechanism is being applied to humans by making cas9 search for mutations
and cut these out, after which a DNA-strand with functional sequences is
implemented and taken up by the cell. This new technology holds the
promise of a future in which genetic diseases can be cured and mutations
of the human genome restored.

People have recently started exploring the possibilities of CRISPR-Cas9.
In January 2013 Feng Zhang\[3\] published the first method of using
CRISPR-cas9 to edit the genome of humans and mice. Molecular scissors
engineered for site-specific modification of the genome give researchers
the means to effectively analyse the genes, genomes and epigenomes. This
could improve understanding of disease states and ease the process of
developing new therapeutical applications. CRISPR-cas9 has been used to
generate disease models to study genetic diseases, such as HIV, Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, Haemophilia, Sickle-cell anaemia and β-thalassemia.
Its possibilities promote future perspectives like cancer research with
in vivo mutagenesis studies on animals, synthetic biology, a sgRNA
library for drug targeting and induced pluripotent stem cell-therapy.
Recent advances in genome editing with CRISPR have opened doors to
application of gene therapy in the real clinic.\[4\] At this point
CRISPR was seen as the big bang of genome editing technology by being a
cost-effective, easy to administer alternative for previous platforms of
genetic modification.

In 2015 researchers in China reported editing genes of human embryos in
an attempt to make them resistant to HIV-infection.\[5\] This was only
the second officially published claim of gene editing in human embryos.
In 2017 they were followed by Americans, who corrected a pathogenic gene
mutation in germline DNA responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in
human embryos and avoidance of mosaicism in the edited embryos.\[6\] The
changes caused by CRISPR are not inheritable unless the technique is
used on reproductive cells or very early embryos. Be aware that this
whispers of designer babies, which could lead to gradual but
irreversible changes in the human gene pool. The consequences of
changing heritable features in embryos for future generations could not
possibly be overseen.

When science moves faster than moral understanding, it may overlook the
consequences for people excluded during the transition, such as the
elderly or those in lower social classes. Current generations were
hardly aware of the technological digital revolution that was upon them,
which has now changed the present and will impact the future
permanently. Bostrom describes the phenomenon of anthropic shadow, an
observation selection effect that prevents observers from perceiving
certain kinds of catastrophes in their recent geological and
evolutionary past. Catastrophe types that lie in the anthropic shadow
are likely to be underestimated; therefore, light should be shed on
them.

Though biotechnology is still in its early stages, most people worry
less about the technological challenges these new developments are
facing than the ethical concerns they raise. In the Netherlands, the
Rathenau Institute conducted a public survey\[7\] on views of the
general public on human enhancement in comparison to current treatments,
such as cosmetic surgery or prescription of Ritalin. They assessed four
main issues that unnerve the public. Firstly, people seem worried about
safety, especially involving health risk and addiction. Social issues,
such as peer pressure and fair access to enhancement resources, are
another topic of concern. Peer pressure might be exerted upon people by
emphasizing that it is unethical not to genetically modify embryos
because it would disadvantage them, thus resulting in societal
inequality. The public feels philosophical and ethical themes, such as
luck and wellbeing, authenticity and identity, are at stake too.
Finally, they are anxious about the shifting border between curing and
augmenting human traits.

However, 90 per cent of the people in the United Kingdom, who learn
their child will be born with Down's syndrome, have an abortion
nowadays.\[8\] In addition, IVF also grants the possibility to screen
embryos prior to implantation. Through pre-selection or a change of
health norms, genetically modified humans could become the new standard.
As genetic diseases are eradicated, more and more people are likely to
become pro human enhancement.

Transhumanists find humans not to be the pinnacle of evolution because
they are limited in mental and physical abilities. These are aspects
that can and should be improved according to Bostrom. They hope to
become post-humans through human enhancement, providing them with longer
and healthier lives. Transhumanists aspire to have better memory and
intellectual abilities, more refined emotional experiences and,
generally, to achieve a greater degree of control over their lives
resulting in higher values, which unenhanced humans do not comprehend.
They ask people to look at post-humanism in retrospect, through the eyes
of post-humans instead of their own. Transhumanists recognize the
dangers and negative consequences these developments may hold but do not
see them as a decisive reason not to proceed. Nevertheless, they warn
people to be aware of these "dystopian scenarios" and to take
precautions.\[9\]

Posthumanists have thought of ways to counteract the
inequality-increasing tendencies of enhancement technology, such as
subsidizing it or providing it for free to lower social classes.
However, there is no guarantee for implementation of such
countermeasures in countries with a health care system based on market
forces. Secondly, posthumanists claim to be able to reverse any adverse
events the modifications might induce using the same technology. They
conclude that every day the science is delayed is a crime against
humanity because science is able to prevent people from suffering.

Kurzweil, a supporter of germline editing, has stated in a press
conference that humanity is the only species that goes beyond its
limitations. He says, "We did not stay in the caves; we did not stay on
the planet; and we are not going to stay within the limitations of our
biology." In his singularity-based documentary, Kurzweil is quoted
saying, "I think people are fooling themselves when they say they have
accepted death." His book, "The Singularity is Near," adds to this,
suggesting medical advances will allow science to make life expectancy
limitless and to continuously repair and replace defective parts of the
human body. He assumes the following step to somatic gene therapy is
using this technology to replace human DNA with synthesized genes.
Biologist P. Z. Myers has criticized Kurzweil's predictions as being
closer to the deluded religious movement of "New Age spiritualism" than
to actual science and accuses him of not understanding basic
biology.\[10\]

Fukuyama, a political scientist and sociologist, warns about the
potential unknown costs of eradicating genetic illness. He fears the
loss of other inherent human characteristics like intelligence or
ambition. He further argues that [humanity could **lose the human
essence** that unites and distinguishes it]{.underline} from other
animals, which he refers to as Factor X. Fukuyama calls for protection
of this factor, which relies on a careful balance of moral choice,
reason, sentience, emotion, dignity and consciousness. It grants people
their right to be considered human and to be guaranteed certain human
rights, such as life and security. Humans must not all be the same to
have rights, but they should for equal rights. [Using biotechnology to
minimize suffering could **go at the expense of people's highest human
qualities**, such are **compassion**, **resilience** and **overcoming
weaknesses**]{.underline}.\[11\]

"[We have evolved to a state that resembles **cancer**: a
**proliferation of the same cell type** without taking in account
organic laws of the whole. The same is being **copied ceaselessly**."
To]{.underline} the philosopher **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**, alongside
cloning, AIDS and viruses, [cancer is a metaphor for **everything that
is happening within society**. The result is an accumulation of roaming
cells]{.underline}. Cells are depicted here as entities containing
certain genetic information, which constantly gets passed on. In his
future, [the old problem of "**love your close ones like yourself**" is
**solved** because the closest ones have become
**identical**]{.underline}.\[12\] An important argument against germline
editing is loss of the egalitarian genetic lottery, which results in
large genetic variations between individuals narrowing down and
clustering within certain social groups.

[Successful people **genetically embed their social advantages** and
**increase disparity** between the top and bottom of the social
hierarchy. Those who are genetically modified may **lose sympathy** for
those who are not by thanking their own enhancements to conscious
choices rather than a result of the genetic lottery.]{.underline}11
Nietszche stated that if there is a continuum of gradations between
human and nonhuman, there is within the type of human as well. According
to him, the ordinary man is unable to relinquish his advantage. The
thought of a purpose and self-benefit outperforms ordinary instincts.
\[13\]

[People are right to worry about the **unpredictable societal** and
**biological consequences** of editing the human genome. However,
**banning technological research** in this field would only mean **loss
of oversight** on scientific development. **Only by participating** can
humanity make sure further research is **guided by caution**, **reason**
and **transparency**]{.underline}. Participation also includes support
of the general public, for which a guarantee of safety is required.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, "The first man, who having fenced in a
piece of land, said 'This is mine' and found people naïve enough to
believe him, was the true founder of civil society." But how are
property rights applied to tissues and cells or the genetic DNA of cells
themselves? Control over one's body remains intact as long as the cells
are attached to you. When cells are no longer inside your body, everyone
could have property rights over them or intellectual property rights in
innovations related to information contained therein. Past examples of
patients whose cell lines were used for technological research without
their knowledge or consent are Henrietta Lacks (HeLa)\[14\] and John
Moore\[15\]. Scientists have grown more than two million HeLa-cells used
in more than 11,000 patents. It is estimated that they cover millions of
dollars worth of biological research. However, the patients will not
profit from this. John Moore lost a property rights battle regarding an
anti-cancer drug derived from his splenic cells, after which he started
a campaign for patients' rights.

Currently, [the life sciences are experiencing a **crisis in public
perception** of their work involving **distrust** and
**misunderstanding**. There is a **growing inaccessibility** of science
and technology]{.underline}, and ethical issues are being resolved
within the sciences with a pragmatic and policy-oriented outcome.
However, BioArt enables the public and humanities to participate in the
[**debate** of what values underpin scientific decisions]{.underline} by
culturally embedding science. It uses the same materials, tools and
technologies as life scientists. It encompasses results of life sciences
and the expectations and fears of it. It [serves as a **social
intervention**, contributing to public discussion as a **mediator** and
aspires to stimulate a **new** and **more productive
relationship**]{.underline} between humanities and science where
artists' practice can be an integral part of scientific
reflection.\[16\]

One example of BioArt challenging the public to consider its
responsibility for transgenic beings is a project by Eduardo Kac in
collaboration with French geneticist Louis-Marie Houdebine. She used the
green fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, which fluoresces green in
exposure of blue light, to create Alba, a glow in the dark fluorescent
bunny. Kac describes Alba to The Boston Globe as an animal, which does
not exist in nature, having a "particularly mellow and sweet
deposition".\[17\] This article generated a global media scandal.
Another project highlighting societal loose ends asks people whether
they know where all their DNA is. Heather Dewey-Hagborg printed
3D-portraits from strangers whose DNA she found on stray hairs and
chewing gum.\[18\]

It is fair to remain sceptical about the role of the artist in the
scientific field. By using the techniques, workspaces and methods of
scientists, artists have similar boundaries and can, therefore, be
influenced by the field they should be reflecting on. Ziakerek describes
this phenomenon as the complicity trap.\[19\] If art is complicit with
technological developments instead of contesting them, it may help their
popular acceptance. This art is often more repetition than rupture,
which makes people question the value of the artists' contribution.
Humanity should carefully preserve artistic integrity and independence
from the sciences by providing a separate workspace for them.

[Initiatives have been launched to **inform people about recent
advances** in human gene-editing research. One example is the Working
Party raised by the Nuffield Foundation council on Bioethics, aimed at
**discussing ethics surrounding genome editing** and **human
reproduction**. Involved are **ethical lawyers**, **bioethicists**,
**medical professionals**, **partners** and
**sociologists**]{.underline}.\[20\]

[The **speed** at which these technologies are developing has **unnerved
many policymakers** and **stakeholders** about **whether appropriate
systems are in place** to govern these technologies.]{.underline} The
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has taken
leadership in the past on controversial new areas of genetic research,
such as cloning and gain-of-function research. They ask how and when the
public should be engaged in the decision making. An expert committee
considers important questions, including balancing potential benefits
with unintended risks, governing use of genome editing, incorporating
societal values into clinical applications and policy decisions, and
respecting inevitable differences across nations and cultures, which
will shape how and whether to use these new technologies. They propose
criteria for heritable germline editing and provide conclusions on the
crucial need for public education and engagement. In addition, they
present seven general principles for governance of human genome
editing.\[21\]

[The prospect of human freedom unchained is **appealing to all**. Yet
its promise is **flawed**. The consequences **cannot be overseen**,
and]{.underline} some argue **[humanity is at stake]{.underline}**.
Public surveys have shown people worry about the impact this new
biotechnology might have on their life. They fear for their wellbeing,
authenticity and identity. However, [banning technological research is
**not an option**]{.underline}. Luckily, [**participation grants
insight** in further technological research. Public engagement and
education is of **great importance**, so the general public can
**contribute to the debate** surrounding human enhancement]{.underline}.
BioArt can serve as a catalyst for involvement. **[More awareness should
be raised]{.underline}** on the topic of human enhancement, [so
**political regulation** and **legal barriers** can be
implemented]{.underline}. Constraining these new technologies out of
respect for nature and with a heedful eye at humanity's future is a
necessity.

[The **central contention** of many scholars in the cyber security field
is that **the gates are down**]{.underline}. [In an era of **digital
connectivity**]{.underline}, [the state is **incapable** of maintaining
its **monopoly on security**]{.underline}. [This is
**true**]{.underline}: [anything networked can be **hacked** and is
**vulnerable** to infiltration]{.underline}. [Yet this is **no
different**]{.underline} \[[than]{.underline}\] [**any other form** of
interaction in international politics]{.underline}. [Any leader can be
**killed**]{.underline}, [any organization]{.underline} seeking to
ensure security for the vulnerable [can be **brought down**]{.underline}
through internal weakness, dissension, or inaction. [Instead of
marvelling at the **novelty** of the cyber domain]{.underline}, [the
focus of scholarship needs to be on what we **know** about the
domain]{.underline}, [how force can be **leveraged** in the
arena]{.underline}, [and how to foster the **ethical** and **considered
use** of power]{.underline}.

Comparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events
that might be outliers, such as the Stuxnet worm (2010), the Sony Hack
(2014), and Russia's denial of service bombardment of Estonia (2007).
While the atypical events in cyberspace might enlighten our
understanding, explaining the everyday and typical in cyber interactions
is often overlooked.

[The other dominant frame is that]{.underline} of a revolution in
military affairs in which [**technological advances** have a **dramatic
impact** on the character and contrast of combat
operations]{.underline}. In the cyber context, [this is the undertone
of]{.underline} Kello's (2013) [work that suggests that the future of
cyber war will **forever change** the way states interact with each
other]{.underline}. Lindsay (2013) and Gartzke (2013) counter this by
noting that there are many constraints on international actors to fully
employ their advanced cyber weaponry. [Technological revolutions are
**never what they seem**]{.underline}, [and require appropriate
integration with existing technologies to make an impact]{.underline}.

The controversy extends the idea that technology will add to the power
and capacity of small states. There are small states such as Estonia and
North Korea where this may be the case, but as a collective this claim
may be dubious. Estonia wields disproportionate cyber power because of
its experience with being attacked in 2007, and is thus now a major
centre for cyber defence for the NATO alliance. Lindsay (2013) and
Valeriano and Maness (2015: 27) maintain that it is the great powers
that will gain the greatest benefit from cyber technologies. Cyber
weapons are not simple and cheap weapons to leverage (p. 261) (Valeriano
and Maness 2015: 35); they are complicated, expensive, and difficult to
utilize for offensive and defense intent.

Many suggested that precision weaponry advanced a revolution and
provided an offset and advantage during the Gulf War (1991); but studies
since have called into the question the efficacy of precision weaponry,
primarily in the context of aerial bombing (Pape 2004; Williams 2010).
This suggests that [**rhetorical arguments** on the question **must give
way** to **fact-based examinations**]{.underline}. [There is a **great
need** in the cyber security field to recognize that broad claims
without evidence are **inadequate**]{.underline}, [and that the
development of theory must be based on **more than vague prescriptions**
for the future]{.underline}.

Definitional Issues

Unfortunately, much time and effort has been spent in the cyber security
field exploring the definitions and terms used in the field. "Cyber
security" refers to the threat opportunities from digital and
computational technologies. Like all frames of security, the idea of
perfect protection is a myth; but this is especially relevant for
computational-based systems, which will always have weaknesses. The only
way to avoid network-based threats is to avoid the drive to network all
electronic devices. The more complex question of protection for whom is
also often avoided. Most discussions implicitly suggest that the one to
be protected is the state, with a focus on critical infrastructure and
national industry, but what of the individual or corporation?

Nye's (2011) definition of cyberspace is useful for political analysis:

the cyber domain includes the Internet of all networked computers but
also intranets, cellular technologies, fiber-optic cables, and
space-based communications. [Cyberspace has a **physical infrastructure
layer** that follows]{.underline} the [**economic laws** of rival
resources and **political laws** of sovereign justification and
control]{.underline}.

(Nye 2011: 19)

[This layering of cyberspace is **critical** in the political discourse
because it is **impossible to leave the state out** of the
analysis]{.underline}. [States **still control a monopoly** on
technology and access through such programmes as the **Wassenaar
Agreement**]{.underline} (limiting access to dual use technologies).
[Institutions also **play a role**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the
International Corporation for Assignment Names and Numbers
(**[ICANN]{.underline}**) [governing domains on the internet and
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations
[convening several]{.underline} Group of Government Expert's
(**[GGE]{.underline}**) [reports]{.underline} on cyber security.

#### Understanding cybersecurity through a datafied epistemic lens is [good]{.underline}. Rejecting data [empowers]{.underline} cybernetic abuses. 

**Valeriano and Maness, 18**---Donald Bren Chair of Armed Conflict,
Marine Corps University; Assistant Professor, Defense Analysis
Department, Naval Postgraduate School (Brandon and Ryan, "How We Stopped
Worrying about Cyber Doom and Started Collecting Data," Politics and
Governance (ISSN: 2183--2463) 2018, Volume 6, Issue 2, Pages 49--60,
dml)

[There have been many challenges to the **utility of data**
in]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations. Hedley Bull (1966) long ago argued that
data-based analysis was tortuous and inelegant. He also maintained that
nothing in data-based examination goes beyond what can be deduced using
conventional wisdom. J. David [Singer]{.underline} (1969) [challenged
this]{.underline} presentation [as being **naïve**]{.underline} about
the utility and purpose of data. [There is a **limitation** on our
ability to understand the world **without** taking a **total snapshot**
of interactions to **make predictions**]{.underline}, **[understand
patterns]{.underline}**, [and examine how outliers may **alter our
perceptions** of interactions]{.underline}. [Data can **illuminate
counterintuitive patterns** not readily apparent to the qualitative
observer]{.underline}.

Insights from postmodern and critical scholars are imperative to our
task. If reality is basically what we make of it (Berger & Luckmann,
1991), what happens when the perspective we construct to deal with
nascent threats is divorced from reality? [While data and evidence will
**never be value free**]{.underline}, an insight offered by critical
theory, [it also offers a **more nuanced approach** to the issue than
selecting the obvious cases for examination and extrapolating from
outliers]{.underline}. We must start somewhere; the postmodern project
is a reaction to the behavioral turn in the social sciences. The cyber
security field has to yet to even start its behavioral moment but seems
to have started with the suggestion that collecting data is impossible
(Kello, 2013).

As Vasquez (1998, p. 218) points out, [**language** and **conceptual
frameworks** are prone to **self-fulfilling prophecies**]{.underline}.
[If we allow the language we use to construct how we view security
challenges]{.underline}, [we likely will **miss key developments** in
the field]{.underline}. [Social science is **not
value-free**]{.underline}, [but this **does not mean that it must be
data-free** in order to reflect the true state of nature]{.underline}.
[Language without the consideration of data and evidence will often be
**empty** and]{.underline} akin to Norse's threat map, which is [an
**imperfect** and often]{.underline} a [**misrepresented** vision of
reality]{.underline}.

Using social science methods can improve the practice of cyber security.
"Science is not simply a useful tool, but a practice that creates a mode
of life that consciously destroys other ways of thinking and living"
(Vasquez, 1998, p. 219). [Without **encouraging** the perspective that
**data adds to the cyber security debate**]{.underline}, [we might
accept observations as **truth** when]{.underline} in fact
[they]{.underline} merely [reflect a **skewed sample** that is not
reflective of **actual patterns** and **practice**]{.underline}. [To
**encourage better behavior** in cyberspace]{.underline}, [to **stop
gross abuses**]{.underline}, [and to **predict future
events,**]{.underline} [we must **move beyond biased** and **constrained
samples** offered by observational logic that **cannot move beyond
description** and **theoretical logic**]{.underline}.

For Vasquez (1998), "**[good]{.underline}**" [empirical theories should
be **accurate**]{.underline}, **[falsifiable]{.underline}**, [have
**explanatory power**]{.underline}, [be **progressive**]{.underline},
[be **consistent** with what is known in other areas]{.underline}, [yet
also be **parsimonious**]{.underline}. [Theories must pass **reasonable
tests of fact** first]{.underline}. The process of progress inherent in
a social science enterprise starts with the collection and analysis of
data. [Once data is collected]{.underline}, [positions and theories can
be **challenged** and **falsified** in light of evidence]{.underline}.
We then can move towards explaining the past, present and future based
on the data processes that we observe now.

The key addition of Lakatos (1970) is that [for a theory to be
**progressive**]{.underline}, [it must obtain **more empirical content**
than the prior theory and generate new and interesting
questions]{.underline}. Without a foundation of theory, data and logic,
we have no bias on which to proceed with knowledge based inquiries.
[Cyber security theory is **empty** without a **firm foundation of
fact** that then pushes us to explore new directions]{.underline}.

Of course, [data is **always biased** by the unit collecting the data
and interpreting the evidence]{.underline}. However, [this is also a
**strength**]{.underline} of data, [others can come along and **use it
for their own ends** and **expand** upon the original intent of the data
to **build different perspectives**]{.underline}. The basic point is
that [we need to **stop engaging important policy questions** through
prognostication that would be **more suitable on a 2am television
advertisement**]{.underline}. [Political scientists and policymakers
**should not be fortune tellers** who make **guesses** about the future
without reference to what we already know]{.underline}. [We have
**evidence**]{.underline} from the recent past and emerging contemporary
situation, [so we **must use it** to engage **critical policy
questions**]{.underline}.

4\. What We Can and Cannot Know from Data

[It is **thought** that most cyber strategies and events are
**secret**]{.underline}, [but this is **not entirely
true**]{.underline}. [Much of what happens in cyberspace is the
**definition of overt**]{.underline}―[by interacting with external
networks]{.underline}, [threat actors make their presence
**known**]{.underline}. Attackers may try to mask their origins, but
**[language traits]{.underline}**, [**common techniques** and
**malware**]{.underline}, [and **motive** as well as **historical
context** can give us a **great deal of information** about who is
attacking whom]{.underline}. For example, near the beginning of the 2018
Winter Olympic Games in Pyeong Chang, South Korea, the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) was hacked and subsequently stolen emails from
the organization were released to the public (Matsakis, 2018). Forensic
analysis attributes this operation to the Russian Federation, which was
the primary culprit from the beginning, as the country had been banned
from competition for the games for a massive doping scandal that Moscow
vehemently denies guilt to this day. Feeling cheated, the APT 28 Russian
hacking group FancyBear, the same group responsible for attacking
Democratic Party networks during the 2016 US presidential election,
enacted their revenge in the digital realm.

Covert action is "the effort of one government to influence politics,
opinions, and events in another state through means that are not
attributable to the sponsoring state" (Anderson, 1998, p. 423). Yet [in
cyber security, the attribution problem is **often
overstated**]{.underline}, [what is beyond our ability is constructing
**real-time data**]{.underline} that can be used to charge culprits in
the act based on domestic legal standards. Observing malicious cyber
behavior is possible but delineating responsibly in a legal sense is
quite difficult. Measuring ongoing infiltrations, unknown zeroday
threats, and attempts at access that fail are difficult if not
impossible to observe. Once an operation achieves a certain level of
access, inserts malware into the target, and seeks to coerce the
opposition, there are clear observable patterns that can be documented.

In short, there is much we can know about the cyber security domain that
can be gleamed from observations. Operating in this landscape as if the
threats cannot be known, monitored, and predicted betrays the great
advances we have made in doing exactly this. What we cannot do is watch
ongoing operations as they occur. This is mainly because organizations
might not know they are violated till after this happens, as was the
case for the OPM hack (Koerner, 2016). Cyber security companies might
operate at a level where they promise a great deal of information, but
this is likely to be a promise that cannot be kept. There is clearly a
great utility in cyber security data, but we must temper expectations
and excitement with collaborative analysis and sobered expectations of
the utility of these data-based efforts.

In the cyber security field, we witness all sorts of interactions that
can be processed into data. Incidents and events, malware and its
spread, vulnerabilities, and social media interactions are all critical
elements of the cyber security discourse and represent collectable data
samples. Yet, the majority of the cyber security field seems to reject
the idea that data collection is possible. This is perplexing in the
face of calls to reform the vulnerabilities equities process (VEP), or
the process by which threats are communicated by the government to
private industry (Newman, 2017). Cyber security data is clearly
observable and a part of the news cycle for cyber interactions, but it
is generally removed from the political, policy, and military discourse.

Unfortunately, [some]{.underline} critics and skeptics [believe that
collecting data on a subject is **synonymous with perfect information**
about a topic]{.underline}. [Data producers have **never claimed** that
their data was **complete**]{.underline}, **[total]{.underline}**, [or
**absent of bias**]{.underline}. These attributes are common for all
data enterprises. In the social science world, [**all** data collection
enterprises will be **incomplete** or **inaccurate** in some
way]{.underline}. [This **does not mean** that data projects should be
**scrapped**]{.underline}, [but that those who use these projects should
understand the **limits** and **possibilities inherent**]{.underline} in
data collection enterprises.

### NATO Good---2AC

#### Emerging tech makes NATO [more relevant than ever]{.underline}. We control the direction of offense---a [lack]{.underline} of security cooperation only makes tech crises [worse]{.underline}.

**Gilli, 20**---Senior Researcher at the NATO Defense College (Andrea,
""NATO-mation": preparing for technological transformation,"
*"NATO-Mation": Strategies for Leading in the Age of Artificial
Intelligence*, Chapter 2, 26, dml)

What are the implications of the growing capabilities and dissemination
of AI, ML and BD for NATO? [Is the]{.underline} Atlantic [Alliance
**powerless** when faced with this wave of technological
change]{.underline}, [or could it adopt some measures to **handle** and
**address** the ensuing challenges and opportunities]{.underline}? And
what [should Allies]{.underline} do? Should they [pursue **arms
control** or promote **research** and **development**]{.underline},
[address **legal** and **ethical questions**]{.underline}, [or just
focus on]{.underline} the **[tactical integration]{.underline}** of
these new technologies? How can the Allies exploit their combined, but
diverse, set of skills, capabilities and experiences so as to harness
the power of AI?

Building on the previous discussion of AI as a GPT, it appears that the
challenge for NATO is subtle, multifaceted and significant. First, in an
age of accelerating technological change and growing domain
applicability, catching up with industry leaders and innovators becomes
more and more difficult for those that lag behind.73 This means that
[waiting is **not a solution**]{.underline} -- [even though acting
prematurely]{.underline}, in a realm of great uncertainty, [is
**inherently difficult** and **risky**]{.underline}.74 Second,
governments cannot expect that individuals, firms and organizations will
be able to embrace and successfully exploit the new wave of
technological transformation alone, without advice, support, direction,
vision or investments in infrastructure. Third, while some countries
will have an advantage, others will find the transition more difficult.
Regardless of this, [technological transitions do not occur in a
**vacuum**]{.underline}, [as they require the alignment of incentives
among a **multiplicity of actors**]{.underline}, [**organizations** and
**institutions**]{.underline}, [as well as the provision of
complementary services and goods for the new technologies to
**flourish** and be **adopted**]{.underline}.75 Fourth, and more
[important for **NATO**]{.underline}, [without]{.underline} coordinating
and **[cooperating]{.underline}** on their investments in the necessary
complementary assets, goods and services, [Allies could]{.underline}
find themselves having to [face **additional hurdles**]{.underline}.

What types of problem could emerge? Technology-generated efficiency
gains in production lead to lower prices. However, lower prices lead to
increases in demand -- because the relative price of substitute goods
(rivals) increases.76 Over the past decade, AI -- and, in particular, ML
-- has made a particular activity, prediction, cheaper: it is reasonable
to forecast that this trend will continue in the future.77 As AI becomes
cheaper, however, the [demand for]{.underline} AI-related [services will
**increase**]{.underline}, thus [leading to more demand for related
necessities like]{.underline} AI **[specialists]{.underline}**, AI
**[infrastructure]{.underline}** (and 5G networks) [and]{.underline} AI
**[components]{.underline}** (processors). [This]{.underline} in turn
[might well lead to **scarcity** and **higher prices**]{.underline},
thus [pitching actors **against one another**]{.underline} -- not unlike
the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis, when individual self-interested
actions led to collectively bad outcomes.78 [In the context of a
**military alliance**]{.underline}, [the problem goes **much
deeper**]{.underline}, [as it can generate a **beggar-thy-neighbour
effect** with allies competing for the same scarce
resources]{.underline}.79 Moreover, **[without]{.underline}**
consultation and **[cooperation]{.underline}**, [Allies could end up
developing **different technological solutions**]{.underline}, [with the
risk of **undermining compatibility** and
**interoperability**]{.underline}. Similarly, [they could end up
**prioritizing some problems over others**]{.underline}, [with the risk
of developing **multiple**]{.underline}, [**different** and **redundant
solutions** while **neglecting other points** in need of
attention]{.underline}.80 However, [through
**intra-alliance**]{.underline} coordination and
**[cooperation]{.underline}**, as well as dialogue and consultation,
secondary market mechanisms and other approaches, [NATO could provide an
**important contribution** to identify and address]{.underline} this
type of [problems]{.underline}.81

### No Mindset Shift---2AC

#### Voting neg doesn't disrupt cybernetic encroachment.

**Markham, 21**---Professor at RMIT School of Media and Communication
and Professor MSO of Information Studies at Aarhus University (Annette,
"The limits of our imagination: Challenges to raising critical
consciousness about datafication and algorithmic archiving," New Media &
Society, Vol 23, Issue 2, 2021, dml)

The premise behind our visual design and performance-based strategy for
ACS is that [disrupting these]{.underline} everyday working [frames is
**difficult**]{.underline}. [[Although the **capacity** for imagining
something new]{.mark} or different [resides in all]{.mark} of
us]{.underline}, [the **[available material]{.mark}** for any
imaginative act [is **greatly influenced** by prior
imaginations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Readers are invited to invoke various
conceptual legacies to flesh out this idea. When designing these
workshops, I was drawing on symbolic interactionism, rhetorical theory,
and organizational communication, including Goffman's notion of frames,
Burke's terministic screens, the general notion of bounded technological
rationality, Lakoff's work on the power of metaphors, Gramsci's writings
about hegemony, and Gidden's social theory of structuration.

[One builds their knowledge about their relationship with technology
through a **dynamic** and **ongoing chain** of learning
moments]{.underline}, [including **using** that technology]{.underline},
[**watching** others]{.underline}, **[learning]{.underline}** from
various others [how these should be used]{.underline}, [and then
**explaining** these possibilities to oneself and others]{.underline}
(Orlikowski, 2000). One's understanding of how technology such as the
internet, social media, or digital platform works grows more concrete
over time, through habitual practice (Giddens, 1984).

This same tendency occurs in everyday conversations, as people describe
to themselves or explain to others the possibilities and limitations of
what a digital platform should be used for. As a chain of rhetoric,
then, each link builds evidence or reasoning that accretes \--over time
and repetition. Whatever we call the outcome\--e.g., terministic
screens1 , technological frames2 , or [technological
rationality]{.underline} 3 , these [function]{.underline} similarly [as
**filters**]{.underline}, [**enabling** and **facilitating** certain
ways of]{.underline} defining and [making sense]{.underline} of digital
platforms or technical devices.

The term 'sharing', for example, is commonly used to describe what we do
on social media platforms. Conducting a genealogy of this term allows us
to reveal an imaginary about how the internet works, particularly
related to how personal information flows into, around, and across
digital platforms and services (cf. Johns, 2015; Markham, 2016). As
Markham (2016) notes, the word 'sharing' places the burden of
responsibility for data and privacy protection on the shoulder of the
individual. Sharing implies a voluntary act of knowingly giving what you
have to someone else. This metaphor operates under the surface of social
media discussions, continuously reinforcing a frame of personal (versus
platform, governmental, or data aggregator) responsibility. However
these frames are constructed\--through practice, structures, or
language, the relationship between an imaginary and a material fact is
time and habit.

The challenge of breaking [[frames]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[are
**buried** in the materiality]{.mark} of technology use]{.underline}

[In everyday [socio-technical environments]{.mark}]{.underline},
existing and common [frames **[may not be]{.mark} even
[noticed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [so [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
implicit or tacit [narrative is [only seen when we **dig
beneath**]{.mark} **the surface**]{.underline}. [[This is **difficult**
once]{.mark} the routine is **[built into the actual
interface]{.mark}**]{.underline}, device defaults, hardware, or
software. One of the questions we commonly asked ACS participants was
'Where do you store your photos?' Many ACS participants would respond
quickly, 'on my phone' but then add '\--or in the cloud.' When pressed,
many didn't know what that meant, precisely. The cloud was described as
many things, including the company that made the device, the browser,
the Internet, the web, a website, a platform, the app, or a server. This
is not to emphasize that people have only a rudimentary understanding of
the infrastructures behind the surface of their device. To an extent, we
all do. Rather, it is to point out that the pathways from the creation
of a data object on one's device to the place where it's stored, as well
as the format in which it is stored, are obscured. This is a good thing,
since it means we don't have to attend to or learn to ignore all [[the
processes]{.mark} behind our digital]{.underline} media
[use]{.underline}. But as they [[are
**invisibilized**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[so]{.mark} too [are
the]{.mark} **pathways**]{.underline}, [and the [**knowledge** of the
process]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Perm---2AC

#### Perm: do \[plan action\] and \[alt action\] [across multiple worlds]{.underline}. Mutual exclusivity relies on a [falsely totalizing]{.underline} theory of cybernetics---working in [multiple worlds]{.underline} makes it easier to [find the cracks]{.underline}.

University of California, Santa Cruz AND Distinguished Professor of
Anthropology & Geography at The Graduate Center, CUNY (Donna and David,

Now again one of the things I really appreciate about your work is that
[you **[never]{.mark}**]{.underline} ever [take something]{.underline}
that comes down the pike [and [say it\'s **all negative**]{.mark}. You
always look at it and say]{.underline}, well OK, [corporate [capital has
**done this** and **this**]{.mark}]{.underline} and this, [[but here
are]{.mark} some **real [possibilities]{.mark}** which]{.underline}, [if
we really think them through]{.underline}, [we can take account
of]{.underline} here. So I\'d like to get you to comment a little bit
about bodies-inthe-making---maybe fill that out a little bit---and then
talk about the possibilities of political action in relationship to
these processes of bodies-in-the-making and the problem of consciousness
in relationship to that process. Haraway Right. Actually, the cyborg is
a good example because some folks have picked up the figure of the
cyborg---because it is after all a configurational move in a politicized
narrative and not a literal statement about the world (but some folks
read it that way too)---some folks pick up the figure of the cyborg and
use it in a celebrational mode, and miss the argument that the cyborg
issues specifically from the militarized, indeed a permanently war-state
based, industrial capitalism of World War 2 and the post World War 2
Cold War. They miss that the cyborg is born as the cyborg enemy, as the
man-machine for extraterrestrial exploration. Now, [[from that]{.mark}
**particularly [unpromising position]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[what]{.mark} **possible** kinds of **[cracks]{.mark}** in the system
of domination [could one imagine **beyond**]{.mark} a kind of
**sublimity**, a kind of [**wallowing** in]{.mark} the sublime of
[domination]{.mark} which]{.underline}, of course, **[many folks
do]{.underline}** \... Harvey I\'m tempted myself sometimes
\[laughter\]. Haraway At times we feel like we don\'t have a lot of
emotional choice. But [the **first** and **[most obvious]{.mark}**
[issue]{.mark}]{.underline} to me [[is]{.mark} that **[no world
is]{.mark} finally [ever closed]{.mark}**[, that]{.mark} the
**[fantasy]{.mark}** of the closed world [is]{.mark} **evidence
of**]{.underline} the pathological conditions called
**[[paranoia]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[laughter\]. And the sense of the
utterly closed system is not Marxist, certainly; [the sense of the
**final enclosure of all possibility** is a **particular psychological
symptom** in the face of being **overwhelmed**]{.underline}, and not a
statement about the structure of the world, in my view. [[**Looking for
the cracks is rule number one**.]{.mark} And looking for the cracks
[**not necessarily** from]{.mark} the point of view of the
[**marginality** o]{.mark}r the **voice of [resistance]{.mark}** or the
**place that isn\'t yet colonized**, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} more of
the way Leigh Star puts it in a wonderful paper that explores her own
allergy to onions---a trivial problem among the world\'s
sufferings---but Leigh uses it as [[an **analytical
wedge**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Being allergic to onions is a hard thing
to convince folks about in restaurants and at conferences. But unless
everyone fesses up to the onions in a given dish, their friend is going
to be very sick very fast, and maybe so sick so fast that it could even
possibly be life threatening. Now, she is not out to ban onions and the
like; but she is interested in talking [about those **systems of
commensurability** in the world by which folks are **supposed to live**
but which they **don\'t** and **can\'t fit**]{.underline}. She uses such
incommensurability as the cognitive starting point for social theory. So
let\'s take a more serious example. [[If you\'re
interested]{.underline}]{.mark}, let\'s say, [[in the **informatization
of the world**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the globalization of the world
through the expansion of telecommunications, [you [**don\'t look for
spaces of resistance**]{.mark} in terms of some kind of **primitive**,
**antitechnology warrior**]{.underline}. Instead, [[you **begin
your**]{.mark} **political**, **intellectual [enquiry]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} the [positions]{.mark} of folks [who have **no
choice**]{.mark} [but to]{.mark} **[live inside the system]{.mark}** of
commensurability which is being established, but who **don\'t** and
**can\'t quite fit**]{.underline}. So if you\'re looking at circulations
of money, you look from the position of the laborer who is absolutely
forced to live life from inside the system of the circulation of money,
but who can\'t quite fit it [in ways which have **cognitive**
implications and **political** implications for some other possible
kinds of livable world]{.underline}. [You are
**[always]{.mark}**]{.underline} cycling through your work and your
[[**thinking** from]{.mark} [the perspective of a **particular
system**]{.mark} of commensurability]{.underline}, whether it\'s money
or information or DNA, the various common coins that bring people into
shared worlds, [**like it or not**. You work through, **not the marginal
position** or some kind of point of resistance that\'s **outside
domination**, but **many kinds of not fitting**.
[That]{.mark}]{.underline}, I think, [**always [comes]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} necessarily living in **more worlds than one**, always
[living in **multiple worlds**]{.mark}. **[There is no way that the
world is totally colonized by a single system]{.mark} of
spatiotemporalities**. [Everybody lives in **more than one**]{.mark}
**world all the time**, [and **learns how**]{.mark} **to do
so**]{.underline}, even inside oneself as well as in any social
collectivity. [Out of that]{.underline}, it seems to me, [the question
of agency becomes, in **principle**, **easy**, In **practice**, it\'s a
question of **use it** or **lose it**. [Agency is not something that
**pre-exists**]{.mark} a situation of [political action]{.mark}, in
which you]{.underline} sort of [**lift up a veil of discoveries** and
then **go do something**. [Agency is]{.mark}, rather, the **practice of
[actualizing the consequences]{.mark}** [of
**multiple**]{.mark}]{.underline} lived
**[[worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### State Key---2AC

#### Any emancipatory politics worth its salt [must]{.underline} include a role for states as [platforms]{.underline} for political action. The alt "[cedes the ground of power]{.underline}" to cybernetics.

**Williams, 15**---Lecturer in Digital Media & Society, School of
Politics, Philosophy, Language and Communication Studies, University of
East Anglia; at time of authorship, Ph.D. candidate, University of East
London (Alex, "Control Societies & Platform Logic," New Formations,
84/85, pp. 209-227, dml)

[In terms of a **critical** or **emancipatory politics**]{.underline},
where does this leave us? [If we are to take]{.underline} control in
[the **cybernetic**]{.underline} sense [as our **basic understanding**
of the **technology of power** today]{.underline}, [we would be **left
groping for essentially resistant political practices**]{.underline}.
**[Hacking]{.underline}**, [the spreading of **viruses**]{.underline},
the [**disruption** of logistical infrastructures]{.underline}, [the
creation of **temporary autonomous zones**]{.underline}: all these would
be central to our thinking. [Though **subversive**]{.underline}, [the
**marginality** of such practices]{.underline} effectively [**cede the
ground of power** to neoliberal capitalism in
**advance**]{.underline}.84 This is, however, a somewhat one sided
picture of contemporary techno-social power. [If we **supplement** our
understanding of cybernetic control]{.underline} with the figuration of
the platform, [it is possible to identify the **basic mechanisms** by
which the present technologies of power **propagate
themselves**]{.underline}: their ability not simply to repress, but also
to construct, with their self-perpetuation directly related to their
ability to enable. Aligned with this, we might observe the similarities
between platform design and Steven Lukes' "three dimensional power" (the
ability to decide what is decided), and especially with Gramsci's idea
of hegemonic power.85

To take up the Gramscian flavour of the platform would also be to employ
Gramsci's double faceted understanding of hegemony: as a theory of power
[**both** as it **exists** in the hands of **capitalist
states**]{.underline}, [and as it **might be held** by the forces which
oppose them]{.underline}. In this sense, [the **task** of an
**emancipatory politics** today]{.underline} would be to build its own
platforms, and to oppose those wielded in the name of profit. Such a
constructive politics [would begin on the **basis of understanding the
most sophisticated forms** of contemporary power within the control
society]{.underline}, the platform, [and proceed by understanding how
its **underlying principles** might be **translated** into the
**repertoires of left politics**]{.underline}. [This might include such
potentially valuable avenues as the question of
**organisation**]{.underline} -- [how do we move from **parties** and
**unions** structured around outdated principles of structural unity
towards designing **platforms for political action** capable of hosting
an **unknowable range** of contingent political actions?]{.underline}
[It might]{.underline} touch upon the problems of planning in the
critique of socialist calculation -- how could an understanding of the
platform [enable a **transition** from thinking in terms]{.underline} of
economic plans [which **exhaustively determine action in advance**
towards relatively open-ended platforms able to **respond flexibly** to
changes]{.underline} within the economy? Finally, we might **[consider
modern states]{.underline}** and markets **[as platforms]{.underline}**,
and the particular ways in [which]{.underline} they [are **generatively
entrenched** within the broader social milieus which they help
organise]{.underline}.

### Techno-Pessimism Bad---2AC

#### The alt spreads [techno-pessimism]{.underline}---causes extinction. 

**Broughel and Thierer, 19**---adjunct professor in the economics
department and at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason

Mason University (James and Adam, "Technological Innovation and Economic
Growth: A Brief Report on the Evidence,"
<https://www.mercatus.org/publications/entrepreneurship/technological-innovation-and-economic-growth>,
dml)

[Technological [innovation is a **fundamental driver**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} economic growth and **[human
[progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, [[that]{.mark} insight
[is]{.mark} often **[lost]{.mark}** or **underappreciated**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} technology **[[policy
discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}** today, [[which]{.mark} frequently
fo[cus on]{.mark} the **[disruptive effects]{.mark}** associated with
technological change]{.underline}.1

Today's technology **[[critics]{.underline}]{.mark}** have moved well
beyond traditional complaints about "the cult of convenience"2 or the
supposed "paradox of choice"3 that innovation creates. Now they
[[claim]{.underline}]{.mark} "it's OK to be a Luddite," because
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[dehumanizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[will **eliminate what it means to be human**]{.underline}]{.mark}."4
Technology and [automation will]{.underline} not only [lead to
a]{.underline} "**[jobless future]{.underline}**"5 ---more profoundly,
modern [innovations]{.underline} represent a "dangerous master" to be
feared and resisted,6 because they [pose an]{.underline} "**[existential
threat]{.underline}**" to the very future of civilization.7 Finally, the
[[critics advocate]{.underline}]{.mark} a
"**[[radical]{.underline}]{.mark}** project of **[[social
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**"8 [and]{.underline} a
**[full-blown]{.underline}** "**[de-growth]{.underline}** movement" [to
**slow**]{.underline} the pace of **[innovation]{.underline}**.9

[[If these]{.mark} **fears** and **anxieties**]{.underline} about
technological change [[come to **influence the formation
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} public **[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[they could **undermine**]{.mark} **the profound benefits** associated
with]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To inform policy discussions and
address the technology critics' concerns, this paper summarizes relevant
literature documenting the impact of technological innovation on
economic growth and, more broadly, on living standards and human
well-being, as well as the important role that public policy has to play
in fostering innovation.

We begin by discussing the nature of innovation in general before
reviewing what the essential models of economic growth, such as the
Solow model and more recent "endogenous" growth models, have indicated
about the role of technological innovation. We summarize some of the
growth-accounting literature's early estimates about the contribution
that technological change has made to growth, and we document what
macroeconomists and economic historians have said about the importance
of technological innovation for economic growth.

Innovation as a concept is difficult to define, but economists generally
use the term to refer to increases in the quality and variety, or
reductions in the cost, of goods and services provided by the market.
The concept of growth, by contrast, is more narrowly focused on
increases in the quantity of goods and services produced---in other
words, it refers to overall production. Measured growth does not always
reflect every way in which production has increased over time, however.
For example, there are well-known limitations to GDP, a main measure of
economic growth. Perhaps the best-known limitation is that GDP struggles
to take into account quality improvements that occur as old products are
made better over time. It also fails to fully consider the rate at which
new products replace old ones over time. Since quality and variety of
goods and services are closely connected to innovation, the shortcomings
of GDP also make it difficult to fully capture the impact of innovation.
Thus, we can generally expect conventional national income statistics to
understate the true impact of innovation on living standards and
well-being. Despite these measurement issues, however, economists still
believe innovation to be a key driver of growth.

An important takeaway from the research on the causes of and
contributors to growth is the observation that differences in physical
capital cannot explain all of the observed variation in growth rates
seen among countries. This explains why, over time, economists have
shifted their attention away from capital and toward more abstract
forces that underlie the process of technological change, such as the
processes that engender new ideas. The importance of technology is not
in doubt, although [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} not always
**[clear]{.underline}** what cultural, political, or market systems
affect the pace of innovation. What is clear, however, is [that
innovation is [**hard** to come by]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is
**expensive** to generate]{.underline}, [and market and policy
imperfections make it such that we get **less** of it than is
**optimal**]{.underline}. In other words, [[we need **much
more**]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[not
less]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[innovation]{.underline} than presently
occurs.

This paper concludes with an extended discussion about the relevance of
these findings for public policy. [The **[cultural attitudes]{.mark}**
of the **public**]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} the attitudes
of **[policymakers]{.underline}**, [[are **critical**]{.mark} for
fostering innovation]{.underline}. [[Without a culture that
**embraces**]{.mark} **risk-taking** and
**[entrepreneurship]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[innovation is]{.mark}
likely to be **[thwarted]{.mark}**]{.underline} because of its
disruptive nature. [This would be a **tragedy**]{.underline}, [given the
**profound benefits** that accompany]{.underline} economic [growth
and]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nological [change]{.underline}.

THE NATURE OF INNOVATION

Although, as mentioned above, the concept of innovation is somewhat hard
to pin down, it can be thought of as taking three forms: (1) cost
reductions, (2) quality improvements, and (3) increases in the variety
of goods, services, and methods of production. Innovation is about
finding new and better ways of doing things and introducing new ideas or
new types of products and services into the marketplace.

This focus on "new ways of doing things"10 and "the development and
widespread adoption of new kinds of products, production processes,
services, and business and organizational models"11 is what lies at the
heart of [the process of innovation]{.underline}. But what is crucial
about this process is that it serves as a means to an end: it [helps
**drive**]{.underline} progress, and **[human flourishing]{.underline}**
more generally. "Innovation is more than the latest technology," notes
Sofia Ranchordás, a resident fellow at the Yale Law School.
"[It]{.underline} is a phenomenon that [can result in the improvement of
living conditions]{.underline} of people [and strengthening of
communities]{.underline}. [Innovation can be **technological** and
**social**]{.underline}, [and the former might assist the latter to
empower groups in ways we once thought **unimaginable**]{.underline}."12

While this paper focuses on technological innovation, innovation more
broadly has impacts that extend far beyond technology and consumer
satisfaction. Social media, for example, is changing the way human
beings interact with one another. Such changes create both benefits and
new challenges, which extend beyond the number, quality, and variety of
goods and services we consume. Innovation changes our culture.

In the short term, changes initiated by [innovation]{.underline} can
lead to disruption, some of which may be unsettling. Some old business
models will fail and some individuals will lose their jobs. In the long
run, however, the endless search for new and better ways of doing things
[drives human learning and]{.underline}, ultimately, [prosperity in
**every sense**]{.underline}---economic, social, and cultural. Those who
lose their jobs will eventually find other jobs and serve the public in
new and different ways. While critics complain about various aspects of
technological change, [[the historical record is **unambiguous**]{.mark}
regarding how ongoing innovation has improved the way we
live]{.underline}.

[[The degree to which a culture is **open to
experimentation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and change, and to new ideas that
threaten to upend the status quo, [[is
**important**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Public
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have the potential to
**evolve**]{.underline}]{.mark} over time [[in ways that]{.mark} can
[either **nurture**]{.mark} or [**hamper**
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Robert Bryce explains why innovation culture and policy are important in
his recent book, Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper: How Innovation
Keeps Proving the Catastrophists Wrong:

[This [**pessimistic worldview** ignores]{.mark} an **undeniable
truth**]{.underline}: [more people are living **longer**]{.underline},
**[healthier]{.underline}**, **[freer]{.underline}**, **[more
peaceful]{.underline}**, [lives than at **any time** in human
history]{.underline}. . . . The plain reality is that [[things
are]{.mark} getting]{.underline} better, [[a **lot**
better]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[for **tens of millions**]{.mark} of
people around the]{.underline} world. Dozens of factors can be cited for
the improving conditions of humankind. But [the **simplest** explanation
is that [innovation is allowing]{.mark} us to **do [more with
less]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13

"Doing more with less" is the core feature of productivity growth. Over
the long term, [productivity growth **raises** the standard of living
for citizens as an **ever greater** number of products and services are
produced with the **same** or **fewer** production inputs]{.underline}
than were required in the past. For example, agriculture was once the
dominant form of employment for Americans, but now only a tiny slice of
the American population is engaged in farming, even while agricultural
output has increased. This change was not easy, but it freed a vast
swath of the labor force to explore other modes of production. As will
become clear in the following sections, [productivity growth and
economic growth are **inextricable**]{.underline}, and productivity
growth is closely related to the process of generating new knowledge.14
It should not be surprising, then, that the knowledge-generation process
has become a central focus of research on the determinants of economic
growth.

New knowledge is hard to come by. For one thing, it has attributes like
those of a public good. In economics jargon, this means it is often
(though not always) nonexcludable and nonrivalrous. (Nonexcludable
signifies that, once knowledge exists, it is freely available for anyone
to use, and nonrivalous indicates that the ability of one person to use
knowledge does not impede the ability of another person to use it.) For
this reason, it is easy for those who invest nothing in the discovery of
knowledge to "free ride" off the inventiveness of others, which can
discourage innovators if they cannot capture all the benefits of their
inventions.

Consider the ordinary cell phone. Even though the device itself is a
private good that can be bought and sold for the exclusive use of
individuals, the basic idea of a mobile telephone is available for
anyone to use. Once the general concept for cell phone technology
exists, any firm around the world can produce its own version of cell
phones; the ability of one firm in Japan to produce cell phones, using
the cell phone "blueprint," so to speak, does not impede the ability of
another firm in, say, the United States to use the same general design.

This "blueprint" quality of knowledge helps explain why innovation is
often thought to be closely connected to research and development. The
nonexcludable nature of technology is a core reason why patent
protections exist to protect inventors. Yet innovation must also be
excludable to some extent---otherwise there would be little incentive
for businesses to invest in new technologies at all. Excludability
implies some degree of monopoly power over new ideas--- which can come
in the form of business secrets, for example---and by extension implies
some degree of suboptimality in markets. Because a monopoly will tend to
produce less than is socially optimal, markets often can't be expected
to produce as much innovation as we would like.

Market imperfections aren't the only realities that discourage
innovation, however. Political forces also stand in the way.15 The
benefits of new knowledge are slow to materialize and tend to fall
broadly across the entire population, while short-term disruptions
caused by innovation often affect well-organized and powerful incumbent
interests. For example, recently the hotel industry has fought to limit
the growth of Airbnb. Such political forces, in addition to the market
forces just mentioned, lead to less new knowledge, and---by
extension---to less innovation than is desirable for society.

GROWTH THEORY AND GROWTH ACCOUNTING

The extraordinarily influential Solow growth model kicked off a 20th
century revolution in growth theory.16 The model attempted to explain
growth using the basic physical inputs of the production process, labor
and capital, along with a generic technological change variable that was
assumed to grow at a steady rate, regardless of any factors that might
change in the model. Jeffrey D. Sachs (a leading development economist)
and John W. McArthur have noted that "Solow did not try to explain the
source of that technological advancement; he merely assumed it."17 This
assumption is especially curious given that the source of long-run
economic growth in the model was this mysterious technological change
variable.

Solow's model did not preclude a role for savings and investment, which
contribute to capital formation, but instead predicted that savings and
investment would influence only the short-run growth rate of the
economy---not the long-run "balanced growth path" growth rate. A key
prediction of the Solow model was that, because of diminishing returns
to capital, countries with a smaller capital stock would grow more
quickly than those with a larger capital stock---so-called "catch-up
growth." For this reason, early studies following Solow's often focused
on whether this prediction, that lower levels of capital lead to faster
short-run growth, held true in the real world.18

Explaining the determinants of growth has led to an entire field within
economics known as growth accounting, which populates the Solow model,
or a model like it, with real-world data in an attempt to empirically
measure the contributors to growth. The modern growth accounting field
started with a 1957 article by Robert Solow himself,19 a follow-up paper
to his classic 1956 article. In his 1957 study, Solow attributed just
one-eighth of the growth of US output per man-hour to changes in the
capital stock, while seven-eighths could be attributed to technological
change.20 A study in 1961 by John Kendrick similarly found that
technological change explains on the order of 80 to 90 percent of labor
productivity growth, depending on the time period analyzed.21

The technological change measures from these studies were actually
measures of something called total factor productivity (TFP), which is
not the same as technological innovation. TFP is assessed in growth
accounting studies through the so-called residual. The residual explains
the growth that cannot be accounted for by the differences in measured
inputs. While TFP is sometimes referred to as a measure of technological
progress, as it was by Solow himself in 1957, in fact, TFP represents
all contributors to growth coming from factors aside from the measured
inputs. The somewhat embarrassing conclusion that the vast majority of
growth cannot be explained by the measurable factors in a growth model
is why TFP is sometimes referred to as a "measure of our ignorance."22

By equating TFP growth with technological change, the early estimates of
economists such as Solow and Kendrick overestimated the contribution of
technology to measured economic growth. While considerable uncertainty
remains, the current consensus seems to be that somewhere between
one-third and threequarters of economic growth can be attributed to TFP
growth.23 Over time, however, growth accounting exercises have become
more sophisticated and have included other determinants of growth beyond
capital and labor, including the average level of human capital per
worker in a country24 and measures of social infrastructure, which
include factors like institutions and government policies.25

The Solow model made no attempt to explain technological advancements,
but the so-called "new growth theory" has taken on the challenge of
identifying the forces underlying technological progress. Much of this
work has built on the phenomenally influential model developed by recent
Nobel Prize winner Paul Romer, whose work seeks to explain the process
of technological change that drives growth.26 The new growth theory
literature inspired by Romer is extensive and tends to emphasize factors
such as population size, research and development spending, and
spillover effects, as new knowledge spreads from one part of the economy
to other areas.

A core assumption in the Solow model was diminishing returns to capital:
that is, as more capital is accumulated, its productivity diminishes.
This assumption, while intuitive on some level, is also rather extreme
in that it downplays the possibility of spillovers---such as the
possibility that workers become more productive as they learn on the
job, or that physical and human capital accumulation contribute to new
knowledge, further enhancing productivity across the economy. Rather, in
the Solow model, technological change is handed down like manna from
heaven. For this reason, the model implies that policies are unlikely to
impact long-run growth. Taxes and regulations that reduce the capital
stock might slow the short-run growth rate, but not the long-run growth
rate.

New growth theory, with its "increasing returns" models, has very
different policy implications from those of the Solow model. These
models often assume spillover effects of various kinds. For example,
worker productivity might increase through experience---so-called
learning by doing.27 Human capital accumulation might have benefits to
all of society, not just to the workers who increase their education.
These small changes in modeling assumptions produce dramatically
different policy conclusions. Increasing returns models find that
policies can influence economic growth rates, such that even small
changes in policy can have dramatic effects over long time horizons.

The current consensus seems to be that capital formation explains
perhaps 30 percent of differences in cross-country growth rates,28 and
almost certainly less than half.29 While this is less than might be
expected, this finding suggests that investment and capital accumulation
do contribute to growth, and increasing returns models offer an
explanation for this empirical result.

Of the remaining unexplained growth, some can be attributed to the
discovery of a few breakthrough technologies, known as general purpose
technologies (GPTs). A GPT is a generic technology with widespread uses
that leads to many subsequent innovations.30 A classic example from
recent years is the internet, which has spawned entire new industries
and also has transformed the way existing industries operate. There is
considerable evidence that breakthrough, revolutionary technologies like
GPTs can affect economic growth rates. Some economists have gone so far
as to model growth as a process that is primarily driven by the arrival
of GPTs.31 Other studies have estimated that just a handful of "great
inventions," such as electricity, could account for as much as half of
TFP growth in the early 20th century.32

In more recent decades, some economists have argued that the
productivity slowdown of the 1970s was temporarily reversed in the 1990s
as a result of the IT revolution that accompanied the creation of the
internet. One study found that the internet explained 21 percent of GDP
growth in mature economies during a five-year period in the early 21st
century.33 Given renewed concerns about stagnant growth,34 it appears
that one or two large discoveries can be enough to trigger growth for
years or even decades.

Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center aptly summarizes what has become a
widespread consensus among scholars from many different fields within
the economics profession: "[[The]{.mark} **long-term
[future]{.mark}**]{.underline} of economic growth
**[[hinges]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultimately [[on]{.mark}
**innovation**]{.underline}."35 Indeed, as Sachs and McArthur have
stated, "The harder we think about it, the more we realize that
technological innovation is almost certainly the key driver of long-term
economic growth."36

In order to boost growth, then, [the **focus** should be on [advancing
the]{.mark}]{.underline} state of the art, or as economists say,
advancing the "**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological
**[[frontier]{.underline}]{.mark}**." A country's distance from the
technological frontier, like its level of capital per worker, will
influence its growth rate. Innovation shifts out the technological
frontier, increasing the global growth rate as "follower" countries are
able to adopt new technologies. This general paradigm, whereby some
leading countries push out the technological frontier and others follow,
means that [countries that contribute disproportionately to]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nological [**progress** also disproportionately
contribute to **human progress more generally** at a **global
level**]{.underline}.

[Public policies are **vital** for nurturing]{.underline} the
[technological innovation]{.underline} that fuels the engine of global
growth. Finding the right mix of policies to foster technological
progress is no easy task, and there is no guarantee that this Goldilocks
mix can be sustained even once found. [[If the innovation engine
**breaks down**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it could have **dire
consequences** for the]{.mark} **entire [world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

But just as Plato failed to appreciate the full benefits of the written
word, today's [technology critics sometimes go **much too far** and
overlook the importance of finding **new** and **better ways** of
satisfying]{.underline} both basic and complex [human needs]{.underline}
and wants. In fact, today's [tech critics are fueled by a]{.underline}
"**[technopanic]{.underline}**" [mentality and are growing
**increasingly more radical**]{.underline}. [They peddle a revisionist
history]{.underline} of Ludditism [and push for an
**innovation-limiting**]{.underline} "**[techlash]{.underline}**" [that
would shackle entrepreneurs with **layers of red tape** before any
progress is permitted]{.underline}.

If not countered, [this swelling anti-tech movement could **curtail**
the creation and diffusion of technologies that could boost **economic
growth**]{.underline}, [raise our **standard of living**]{.underline},
[improve our **health**]{.underline}, [and extend our
**lives**]{.underline}.

Are Innovation's Benefits Just an Illusion?

In a recent white paper, my Mercatus Center colleague James Broughel and
I cataloged the **[voluminous literature]{.underline}** that [documents
the symbiotic connection between **technological
innovation**]{.underline}, economic growth, [and **human
flourishing**]{.underline}. [**Decades of research** by
historians]{.underline}, [political scientists]{.underline}, [and
economists reveals that technological innovation is a **fundamental
driver** of long-term improvements in well-being]{.underline}.

However, [today's tech critics would have us believe those empirical
findings are **largely hogwash**]{.underline}. Scanning lists of
top-selling tech policy books and the most assigned texts on innovation
in college classrooms, [one is struck by the **lugubrious lamentations**
of the critics]{.underline}. Increasingly, [academics are calling into
question technology's]{.underline} very **[worth to
civilization]{.underline}**.

Anti-tech complaints used to be focused primarily on how innovation
creates a supposed "cult of convenience" or a supposed "paradox of
choice" because of the cornucopia of options it offered to us. Today's
critics build on these critiques but have also upped the ante. Borrowing
the old neo-Marxist clichés about how industrialization is
"de-humanizing" and "alienates" the masses while force-feeding us stuff
we do not need, [modern tech critics]{.underline} go further and [claim
that innovators are]{.underline} "**[reengineering
humanity]{.underline}**." [These critics suggest that]{.underline}
innovation's benefits are dubious at best and that [technology
is]{.underline} not a helpful servant to humanity but instead
[a]{.underline} "**[dangerous master]{.underline}**" [that
is]{.underline} "**[slipping beyond our control]{.underline}**."
[Consequently]{.underline}, "it's OK to be a Luddite," writes David
Auerback in Slate, because [modern tech]{.underline} "[will **eliminate
what it means to be human**]{.underline}."

The book titles or subtitles from leading tech critics include
frightening phrases like "Techno Creep," "Future Crimes," "Against the
Machine," "Digital Barbarism," and, "Click Here to Kill Everybody." In
this dour worldview, technology is destroying both our culture and
economy. [Critics warn of a coming **digital dystopia**]{.underline},
[where truth and authority **vanish**]{.underline}, [high culture
**crumbles**]{.underline}, [and political polarization breeds
**closed-mindedness** and even the very **death of
democracy**]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, robotics, machine-learning, and [automation pose
an]{.underline} "**[existential threat]{.underline}**" [to the very
**future of civilization**]{.underline} not only because they will lead
to a "jobless future," but [because they will brainwash us into becoming
a]{.underline} "**[world without mind]{.underline}**," [in which we
cannot think for ourselves]{.underline}.

Blueprint for Reconstructing Civilization

[Is there any hope of surviving the impending
techno-apocalypse?]{.underline} [Perhaps]{.underline}, the critics say,
[but only with]{.underline} a heavy dose of precautionary
principle-based policymaking and [a return to a]{.underline} "**[simpler
time]{.underline}**" or some wiser form of living.

Best-selling tech critic Evgeny Morozov advocates [a]{.underline}
"**[radical project of social transformation]{.underline}**," "**[data
distributism]{.underline}**," [and a full-blown]{.underline}
"**[degrowth movement]{.underline}**" to halt the pace of innovation.
Morozov's distaste for private digital platforms like Facebook and
Google runs so deep that he recently applauded China for "reasserted
sovereignty in the digital domain" with its "social credit system,"
which is a centralized method of online reputation scoring of citizens.
(Apparently, he is not too worried about how China already uses its
massive digital surveillance infrastructure to oppress dissenting
views.)

Morozov and other [critics]{.underline} like Brett Frischmann and Evan
Selinger [regularly play up the benefits of]{.underline} "**[adding
friction]{.underline}**" [to the technological design and diffusion
process]{.underline}. [They are **not always clear** about what that
entails]{.underline}, [but they **rail** against the idea of
**efficiency** as a societal benefit]{.underline}. [They instead suggest
we should **slow things down** and **gum up the works a bit** to be more
thoughtful about the tools we are creating]{.underline}. [Although they
will never admit it]{.underline}, "[adding friction]{.underline}"
[likely means **fewer choice**]{.underline}, **[higher
prices]{.underline}**, [and **longer delays** in the technological
improvements most of us desire]{.underline}.

Luddites Living in an Amish Paradise?

Critics like Frischmann often argue that "there's nothing wrong with
being a Luddite," because if nothing else it, "enables critical
reflection and evaluation of the technological world we're building." In
their revisionist accounts, the Luddites have been recast as the
original "humanists" and defenders of Amish-esque values, who understood
how to temper the role of modern technology in our lives.

But the Luddites were not Amish. The Amish lifestyle is completely
voluntary and, in many ways, there is much we can learn from it. But we
are also free to reject it and the Amish will not impose their
anti-modernist values upon us through threats of force.

That is the fundamental difference between appreciating the Amish versus
calls for a reassessment of the Luddites as a model for reorganizing
modern society. Today's neo-Luddites seek to preserve whatever
technological status quo they desire, and would impose that choice upon
us whether we like it or not. Thus, when the critics wax nostalgic about
the Luddites, it suggests that more forcible resistance to change is
required, likely through sweeping bureaucratic controls on every facet
of technological development.

If, therefore, [modern tech critics]{.underline} wish to align
themselves with the Luddites, they [should]{.underline} at least [own up
to the fact that what they desire is something **quite
radical**]{.underline}. A reembrace of Ludditism [and]{.underline} the
creation of a "degrowth movement" [would necessitate **highly
repressive** and **destructive steps** to end technological progress as
we know it and]{.underline}, [in the process]{.underline}, [deny society
choices that most of us believe better our lives in **countless
ways**]{.underline}.

The Unabomber Bounces Back

[We already see the potential dangers of these ideas with]{.underline}
the [**growing anti-technological militancy** of some]{.underline}
environmental [activists]{.underline}. New York magazine recently
documented how [many]{.underline} of them [are experiencing
their]{.underline} "**[Kaczynski Moment]{.underline}**," when they
discover the extremist teachings of Ted Kaczynski (aka, "the Unabomber")
and come to "understand progress as industrial slavery."

Ironically, several versions of Kaczynski's Unabomber Manifesto as well
as his Anti-Tech Revolution are available on Amazon and sell for
\$10-\$20. The average review for the books are around four out of five
stars and include customer reviews about how he is a "misguided genius"
whose books are "brilliant, riveting and useful" and are full of
"well-articulated thoughts" and "fascinating ideas."

Kaczynski's critique of industrial society apparently doesn't extend to
his own ability to sell books on the world's biggest online retailing
site. And it appears buyers aren't too concerned about spending money in
support of a man who killed and maimed over two dozen people during a
twenty-year nationwide mail-bomb reign of terror.

Regardless, [ideas have **consequences**]{.underline}, [and we shouldn't
be surprised to see more people **casually embracing such
dangerous**]{.underline}, **[anti-human thinking]{.underline}** with
academics blithely claiming that "there's nothing wrong with being a
Luddite" and encouraging them to embrace a "degrowth movement."

Tool-Making is in Our Nature & the Key to Human Flourishing

Properly understood, "[technology]{.underline}" [simply represents the
practical application of knowledge to a task or need at
hand]{.underline}. As Benjamin Franklin once noted, "man is a
tool-making animal" because, [by our **very nature**]{.underline},
[tool-building]{.underline} it [is the **key to our survival** and
**prosperity as a species**]{.underline}. [Through **ongoing
trial-and-error tool building**]{.underline}, [we discover **new** and
**better ways** of satisfying human needs and wants to better our lives
and the lives of those around us]{.underline}. [Human flourishing is
**dependent** upon our collective willingness to **embrace** and
**defend** the creativity]{.underline}, [risk-taking]{.underline}, [and
experimentation that]{.underline} produces the wisdom and growth that
[propel us forward]{.underline}.

By contrast, today's neo-Luddite [tech critics suggest that we
should]{.underline} just be content with the tools of the past and
[**slow down** the pace of technological innovation to supposedly save
us from **any number of dystopian futures**]{.underline} they predict.
[If they succeed]{.underline}, [it will leave us in a **true dystopia**
that will **foreclose** the entrepreneurialism and innovation
opportunities that are **paramount** to raising the standard of living
for **billions** of people across the world]{.underline}.

The difficulty of following these critiques from American Legal Realists
and these other heterodox authors to any normative conclusion, however,
seems two-fold. On the one hand, [[to think **outside**]{.mark} of
[consumption seems]{.mark}]{.underline} in some ways [to border on a
**[theological]{.mark} aspiration**]{.underline}, [to be ushered
into]{.underline} the responsibility of [remaking society according
to]{.underline} some almost **[other-worldly dimensions]{.underline}**:
[an economic order that conceives **progress beyond
growth**]{.underline}, [a socio-political structure that allows for
systemic change **without reducing**]{.underline} the possibilities of
human **[freedom]{.underline}**, [the normative agenda to **substantiate
egalitarian relationships**]{.underline}, [a global order that
**preserves** the victories of]{.underline} industrial [capitalism while
simultaneously **transcending** its costs]{.underline} (ecological,
human, etc.). On the other hand, [[critiques of consumption]{.mark}-led
[governance]{.mark} seem both **anachronistic** and
**violent**]{.underline}. They are [**anachronistic** because
[they]{.mark} either **too readily** rely on]{.underline} the
possibilities of [the **Enlightenment [assum]{.mark}ption** that there
is [a **clear set** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
'**[[truths]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [that [once
**disseminated**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the population [will **[enact
meaningful change]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., [[if]{.mark} particular
industries]{.underline} or products [are **[demonstrated]{.mark}** to be
**[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the environment,
[[populations will **demand alternatives**]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[or]{.mark} they [**overly invest** in]{.mark} the possibility of [some

spirit]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is [capable of
**[trumping]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[politico-economic
[exigencies]{.mark}]{.underline}** of personal well-being (e.g.,
[[individuals are **naturally willing** to **collectively do the right
thing**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the greatest amount of people [even
[at]{.mark} **personal [cost]{.mark}** in a **consistent
manner**]{.underline}). [They are **violent** because in calling for
[systemic change]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such reversals [would]{.mark}
**almost undoubtedly** [entail **significant** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
most likely [**intensely [hostile opposition]{.mark}** [from entrenched
actors]{.mark} who benefit from the current]{.underline} economic legal
[arrangements]{.underline}. A **[liberal]{.underline}** mode of
**[economic management]{.underline}** (e.g.,
**[consumerism]{.underline}**) [is]{.underline} itself [**undoubtedly
more coercive** and **violent** than its advocates]{.underline} tend to
[admit]{.underline} (e.g., it is part of the very problems it claims to
address), [but]{.underline} where [[the **fundamental**]{.mark} **point
of [disagreement]{.mark}**]{.underline} arises [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
over the question [[whether]{.mark} the [current]{.mark} trajectory is
occasioning a level of **[lost opportunity costs]{.mark}** that
[**warrant the effort** and **violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} most
likely [[**necessary** to enact an **alternative mode**]{.mark} of
political life]{.underline}. Furthermore, [if we **accept**]{.underline}
the proposition of [the **necessity** of coercive change]{.underline},
[it **still begs the question** to what extent its proponents within
intellectual circles are really willing to **fully participate** and
**accept** the potential costs]{.underline} of radical struggle -- [they
may]{.underline}, to put it vulgarly, simply [have **too much comfort to
lose**]{.underline}. To what extent, in short, are current left-oriented
calls within academia and policy circles merely reflecting the more
general postmodern crisis of identity versus the partisan militant
residing at any revolutionary core? [In giving **normative bite** to any
alternative model]{.underline}, as the American Legal Realist Robert
Hale pointed out, it seems undoubtedly the case that [any future system
would only find **new constraints** and **forms of violence** to sustain
its cohesiveness]{.underline}.

\[T\]he systems advocated by professed upholders of laissez-faire are in
reality permeated with coercive restrictions of individual freedom, and
with restrictions, moreover, out of conformity with any formula of
"equal opportunity" or of "preserving the equal rights of others." [Some
sort of **coercive restriction**]{.underline} of individuals, it is
believed, [is **absolutely unavoidable**]{.underline}, and cannot be
made to conform to any Spenserian formula.161

[If fundamental reform to consumer-centric governance is **inherently
violent**]{.underline} -- in that [it will **necessarily
create**]{.underline} only [**new winners** and **losers**]{.underline},
and [not without **potentially violent conflict** and
**disruption**]{.underline} -- [[the challenge is]{.underline}]{.mark}
therefore [[**not** just]{.mark} a question of [**ethics** or
**political will**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., the current distribution
of resources is unjust/violent), [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[feasibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** of re-conceptualizing efficiency,
[both [in]{.mark} terms of [**strategy** and

### AT: Cybernetic Socialism/Communism

#### Digital socialism is a [sham]{.underline}.

**Gardiner, 20**---Professor of Sociology at the University of Western
Ontario (Michael, "Automatic for the People? Cybernetics and
Left‐Accelerationism," Constellations: An International Journal of
Critical and Democratic Theory, August 6, 2020, dml)

The notoriety of Project Cybersyn in Left‐accelerationist circles and
beyond is perhaps not entirely surprising insofar it is the best‐known
example of consciously deploying cybernetic principles for what were
felt to be emancipatory ends, rather than the augmentation of state or
corporate power.3 Due to circumstances very much beyond its control, the
system was never brought fully online, and of course we will never know
the directions in which it might have developed. However, thanks to
Medina\'s detailed and exacting research, [we have been made aware of
the sometimes **yawning gap** between]{.underline} Beer\'s vision and
how it aligned politically with [the **undeniably admirable goals**
of]{.underline} Chilean [socialism]{.underline}, [and the **actual
nature** of]{.underline} Cybersyn\'s attempted
**[implementation]{.underline}**. For instance, [worker participation
was **token** at best, and not an **integral part** of system
design]{.underline}; [engineers and factory managers **didn\'t really
overcome** their professional and class bias]{.underline}; [and **gender
inequities**]{.underline} with regard to design and organizational
management [were **barely acknowledged**, never mind **meaningfully
addressed**]{.underline} (see also Espejo, 2009, p. 79). However, [we
are]{.underline} less [concerned]{.underline} here [with]{.underline}
the historical realities of Cybersyn or the specific features of Chilean
socialism than more general **[cybernetic principles]{.underline}** [and
how they might **lend support** to any viable postcapitalist
transition]{.underline}. Put differently, to indulge in a spot of
"immanent critique," [do the claims of [Left]{.mark}‐accelerationist
[cybernetics]{.mark} regarding enhanced possibilities for human freedom,
solidarity, and autonomous self‐actualization **match**]{.underline} the
**[reality]{.underline}** (or potential reality)? What is crucial
vis‐à‐vis any such discussion is the (often implicit) suggestion,
outlined in the previous section, as to the qualitative differences
between first‐ and second‐order cybernetics, together with the idea that
Left criticisms typically, and illegitimately, conflate the two. Rather
than the use of negative feedback oriented to the maintenance of order
by inhibiting counteraction, so [the argument]{.underline} goes,
second‐order cybernetics [is [concerned with **positive
feedback**]{.mark}, working through **[amplification]{.mark}** and
**enhancement** [of]{.mark} the original signal, whereby]{.underline}
the presence of [[**complexity** and **chaotic states**]{.mark}
demonstrates]{.underline} the non‐linearity of systems and their
capacity for **[unpredictable change]{.underline}** in the pursuit of
open‐ended (but self‐correcting) goal attainment. And yet, a careful
examination of writings by the likes of Tiqqun or Châtelet demonstrate
that they were generally aware of different currents in cybernetic
thinking, but nevertheless argue that, [[**whatever** its]{.mark}
ostensible [methods and goals]{.mark}]{.underline}, second‐order
[cybernetics [promulgates a **new regime** of power]{.mark} and control
[that **dovetails**]{.mark}]{.underline} in many respects [[with]{.mark}
the requirements of [today\'s **supercharged
technocapitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Going further, they intimate
that [[even]{.underline}]{.mark} some version of "**[[cybernetic
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [with presumably novel human‐machine
assemblages, **[might not]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessarily
[**[escape]{.mark}** this morass]{.underline}.

Arguments concerning this shift to a new regime of power often make
reference to one of Deleuze\'s late essays, or at least show its
influence: the brief but tantalizing "Postscript on Societies of
Control." In nuce, Deleuze\'s position is that the type of
"disciplinary" society theorized by Foucault, marked by various
enclosures (schools, factories, military barracks, bureaucracies)
wherein social behaviors were scrutinized and minutely organized in
space‐time so as to enhance their productive efficacy during an era of
industrial capitalism, has been superseded by a quite different system
of ruling more relevant to the present situation of powerful global
corporations and the centrality of the "knowledge economy." That is,
whereas disciplinary societies concern themselves with a process of
homogenizing subjectification largely through panoptical means, by which
compliant individuals are integrated seamlessly into the mass, [control
societies]{.underline} are post‐panoptical, and [rely]{.underline}
instead [on]{.underline} "[**ultrarapid forms** of free‐floating
control]{.underline}" (Deleuze, 1992, p. 4). [Crucial]{.underline} with
regard to the latter [is the **continuous accumulation** of statistical
information via the elicitation of **communicative exchange** across the
entire social field]{.underline}. The focus ceases to be the atomized
individual, but rather a numerically‐based assessment of the "dividual,"
by which Deleuze means a generically average subject made comprehensible
through opinion surveys, sampling techniques, and market research.
[Control is now exercised]{.underline}, not [through]{.underline}
hierarchical, top‐down management, much less by fostering techniques of
hermeneutical self‐examination, but [the pattern analysis of myriad
electronic traces and the subtle shaping]{.underline} (or "nudging") [of
micro‐behaviors]{.underline} via what Deleuze calls "universal
modulation." [The key is that these environments are **not segmented**
and **closed**, but **fluid** and **open**, and that social actors
**participate** in and **maintain** the system dynamically through their
own **seemingly voluntaristic**]{.underline} choices and actions, à la
Lefebvre\'s "splendid impression of **[spontaneity]{.underline}** and
harmony."4

The relevance of Deleuze\'s "Postscript" to our concerns should be
fairly obvious. First‐order cybernetics is in lockstep with the nature
and demands of what we might call late‐disciplinary societies.
Second‐order [[cybernetics]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast,
[[appears]{.mark} more [**compatible** with]{.mark} progressive, even
[liberatory aims]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An indication of this
latter orientation is that [many]{.underline} of the [key figures
in]{.underline} British [cybernetics]{.underline} situated themselves on
the Left of the political spectrum, and [cultivated **non‐conformist**
and often explicitly **anti‐authoritarian** interests]{.underline}, even
if Beer himself was something of a "champagne socialist."
[Yet]{.underline}, in [**[embracing]{.mark} complexity**,
**[contingency]{.mark}**, and **openness**]{.underline}, second‐order
cybernetics [[is **not**]{.mark} **wholly [immune]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
the mentality of **[control]{.mark}** and **governance**]{.underline}.
Indeed, the types of [non‐linear self‐organization]{.underline} as
discussed by Deleuze [are **necessarily premised on disequilibrium** and
**chaos**]{.underline}: [[the multiplication of **horizontal**]{.mark},
**autonomously‐structured communicative [networks]{.mark}** [is the
**new mode of control**, **not**]{.mark} **any sort of [emancipation
from]{.mark} prevailing systems of [power]{.mark}**. [Control
societies]{.mark} depend **precisely** on the **constant elicitation**
of affects and desires, as **opposed** to their **repression** or
**curtailment**]{.underline}, provided they can be channeled into forms
of communicative action subject to ongoing surveillance and statistical
quantification. In second‐order cybernetics, as Maroš Krivý (2018, p.
18) usefully puts it, "[power relations [reproduce through
**proliferating indeterminacy**]{.mark}, **nonlinearity** and
**complexity**, [**rather** than]{.mark} by [**curbing** these]{.mark}
into **determinate**, **linear** and **unidirectional**
forms]{.underline}."

Writing from the perspective of the French context of the 1990s, but
hardly irrelevant to our own era of "nudge theory," smart cities, and
the like, Châtelet (2014, p. 23) suggests that the mania for
[[incorporating]{.mark} concepts of "**[chaos]{.mark}**" and
"**self‐organization**" [into]{.mark}]{.underline} what he regards as
[[**pseudo‐liberationist** thinking was]{.mark} **part** and **parcel**
of]{.underline} the intellectuals' post‐1968 [[**capitulation** to
"**market democracy**]{.mark}." The latter is **foursquare in favor** of
the "**right to difference**," calling for an **end to heavy‐handed
state interference** and]{.underline} concomitantly
**[eulogizing]{.underline}** social mobility and permanent
"**[nomadism]{.underline}**." But that\'s only because [[the]{.mark}
neoliberal [market]{.mark} itself **[loves]{.mark} fluidity**,
**movement**, and **constant acceleration**, seeking to capture [the
"**creative power of chaos**]{.mark}" through a "**cyberpolitics**" that
generates order out of the disorder of self‐regulation]{.underline}.
Authoritarianism of the obvious variety is replaced by the covert
injunction to produce and consume information, to subscribe
enthusiastically to a universal "will to communicate." Yet the
encouragement to speak in the context of today\'s "social (or "global")
factory," to cooperate, to express one\'s "authentic" thoughts and
feelings, is ultimately a coerced and deadening gesture. For Châtelet,
[the "**chaos of opinions** and **microdecisions**" relies on a rhetoric
of freedom via **auto‐emergence**, but there is **always an apparatus of
control** working discretely behind the scenes]{.underline}, and hence a
crucial distinction to be made between powerful designers and operators
and those being operated on. [Since the conventional state apparatus is
now **too slow** and **clumsy**]{.underline} to respond effectively to
the demands of the new fluid social ontology, [scientific management of
political sovereignty is rendered **much more palatable** when presented
in the guise of refined "pressures exerted by an **anonymous** and
**nonlocalized entity**"]{.underline} (p. 33). This constitutes a
"ventriloquism" of power‐effects operating through such ubiquities as
globalized market forces, intermeshed communicative networks, and the
relentless organization of "public opinion." [Any particular social
atom]{.underline}, the locus classicus of disciplinary societies, [is
**irrelevant**]{.underline} here; echoing Deleuze, for Châtelet [what\'s
important is the **modulation of network fluidity** via
"hydro‐cybernetics,"]{.underline} and the effectuation of valuational
equivalences across numerous domains through a universal system of
inputs and outputs. Whereas the Young Turks of the new cybernetic order
(the children of Lefebvre\'s cybernanthropoi?) conflate horizontality
with enhanced democracy, Châtelet is adamant that the former does not in
any way necessarily vouchsafe the latter. Indeed, [[horizontal
formations **concentrate power**]{.mark} in vital nodal points, [and are
**more effective**]{.mark} for being **anonymous** and **unseen**,
**everywhere** and **nowhere** at once, [in **contrast** with]{.mark}
"**overly [visible verticalities]{.mark}**[" that]{.mark} might
[precipitate]{.mark} **resentment** and **[opposition]{.mark}**. [The
result is]{.mark} the "**well‐mannered anarchism**" of the market,
which]{.underline}, unlike the "romantic" anarchism of old, [threatens
**no societal upheavals**]{.underline} ‐ first, because geared towards
optimal management of a coolly technocratic nature, but also insofar as
[there is [no]{.mark} worker "**[downtime]{.mark}**" in an age of 24/7
networked production/consumption, [and]{.mark} hence **little
[opportunity]{.mark}** [to **foment**]{.mark} **dreams of
[revolt]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

From the vantage‐point of the early 2000s, in The Cybernetic Hypothesis
Tiqqun takes some of these arguments further. Although Cybersyn isn\'t
referenced directly here, they hone in on the technophile Left\'s
contemporaneous fascination with cybernetic possibilities, anticipating
later positions advanced by the Left‐accelerationists and "fully
automated luxury communists." According to Tiqqun, the period of
upheaval around 1968 could be interpreted as the last reverberation of a
cycle of struggles that dominated Western societies over the two
previous decades. [Facing]{.underline} the manifold shocks of rising
worker militancy, the energy [crisis]{.underline}, and
precipitously‐declining rates of profit, global [capitalism required
**full‐scale reconstruction**, and]{.underline}, as discussed above,
[cybernetics **fit the bill very well**]{.underline}. However, [the
logic of cybernetics appealed to]{.underline} certain
technologically‐oriented [**critics** of capitalism as
well]{.underline}, such as those advocating an "ecosocialism" premised
on equilibrium and a steady‐state economy through decentralization and
differentiation, especially in light of the Club of Rome\'s famous 1972
document "Limits to Growth." For Tiqqun (2020b, p. 98), however, [this
represents a kind of "**social capitalism**" seeking change through the
democratization or socialization of the "decisions of production," as if
a **full‐blown post‐Fordist society** could **emerge spontaneously**
from a dispersed, popular "**collective intelligence**."]{.underline} As
an example, a "new social contract" like universal basic income adopts
the logic of the current system\'s emphasis on "human capital" and the
metaphysics of production. It is not incompatible with money, commodity
exchange, or markets, and would only free up more disposable income so
as to accelerate the circulation of goods and information at the behest
of processes of value‐capture (see also Beech, 2019, p. 93). Ultimately,
for Tiqqun [this would make the labor force itself **more**, rather than
**less** pliable. [If]{.mark} the "new spirit of [capitalism]{.mark}"
[is **cybernetic to the core**, so are "**Left**" solutions]{.mark} to
the present crisis [that rely]{.mark} extensively [on
**repurposing**]{.mark} **existing infrastructures**]{.underline},
neoliberal subjective dispositions, and logistics, [so as [to end up
with]{.mark} a "**[communism]{.mark} of capital**."]{.underline} Or, to
put it differently, [any approach advocating the "framing of the world
in terms of problems" is **not a genuine communist project**, but in
reality **another path to capitalism**]{.underline} (Tiqqun, 2020b, p.
109; also Culp, 2018, p. 167). In this way, [cybernetic capitalism has
**absorbed** its ostensible opponents into an **overarching paradigm**
of social regulation governed by a **managerial reason**, disposed
to]{.underline} what The Invisible Committee (2015, p. 124) terms [the
"**cult of the engineer**," that can serve the political objectives of
"Left" **just as well** as "Right."]{.underline} Even Pickering (2010,
p. 273) admits that Cybersyn could have been re‐engineered by
technicians and state functionaries of the Pinochet regime, and deployed
to more nefarious ends than Beer would probably have imagined, which is
likely not the kind of "repurposing" Left‐accelerationists have in mind.

It is noteworthy that Alex Williams has written independently about the
relationship between Deleuze\'s theory of control societies and
cybernetics, and it is therefore important to consider his arguments
here. Rather than contrast the US and UK developments, and primarily
associate "first‐order" cybernetics with the former and "second‐order"
with the latter (a convention we have followed here), Williams advances
a different set of distinctions. That is, he reserves the term
first‐order for 20th‐century cybernetics in general, whatever the
differences between, say, Weiner or Beer (odd in light of his admiration
for Cybersyn, which gets only passing mention here), and suggests
second‐order is a phrase better‐suited to the networked "platform"
systems of the 21st‐century, such as Airbnb, Facebook, or Uber.
First‐order cybernetics, by Williams' reckoning, follows the domineering
control logic as characterized above: it aims to modulate action via
recourse to homeostatic equilibrium so as to realize pre‐set goals. In
contrast, "platforms" are design architectures that work primarily not
through constraint, but by enabling [actions through positive feedback
circuits that **cannot be prefigured** in advance]{.underline}.
Platforms, writes Williams (2015, p. 223), are "materialised
transcendentals -- they act as conditions of possibility for other
processes and entities to exist." As "entrenched" infrastructures they
do restrain in certain ways (for example, Microsoft owns the vast
majority of home computer operating systems and forces users to conform
to its licensing arrangements and surreptitious forms of data
collection), but they also [provide the ground for **unpredictably
contingent** or "**generative**" outcomes, and hence contain
**hitherto‐untapped potentialities** for [autonomous self‐organization
**outside** the]{.mark} aegis of [**state** and
**capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [Williams [is]{.mark} **notably
[vague]{.mark}** [on what forms]{.mark} of such self‐organization
[**might be possible** here, or **what exactly** is being
"**enhanced**"]{.mark} through the utilization of such platforms in ways
[that]{.mark} might be considered "**emancipatory**," assuming this
[doesn\'t **bolster**]{.mark} the [hegemonic power]{.mark} and virtual
ubiquity of existing platforms]{.underline}. As argued earlier,
[[control systems work]{.mark} **precisely** [through such
"**enhancements**]{.mark}," via the solicitation, reinforcement, and
augmentation of myriad desires and affects]{.underline}, so long as they
can be successfully captured and "put to use." "Platform capitalism"
emerged after the 2008 crisis, argues Sebastian Olma (2016, p. 171),
because of capital\'s need to both create and exploit a situation of
permanent entrepreneurialism and precariousness in an era of falling
profits, disinvestment, and declines in manufacturing productivity. In
other words, the harnessing of auto‐exploitation is integral to these
systems' very design, whereby "platform proletariats" are pauperized
both materially (participants in the "gig economy," once time, expenses,
and insurance are factored in, earn much less than even the minimum
wage) and in terms of a relentless degradation of skill and knowledge.
As such, [[it\'s **difficult to see the liberatory potential**]{.mark}
here, insofar as such platforms are essentially about **extending market
logic** into any and all domains of human life]{.underline}. In
[this]{.underline} context, Beer\'s algedonic meters, however crude or
well‐intentioned, seem to anticipate today\'s omnipresent data capture
and the vast amounts of unpaid digital labor it exploits (Amazon user
reviews, Facebook "likes," etcetera), which are all forms of "soft"
coercion encouraging the formation of certain subjective dispositions in
line with the demands of hyper‐productivity and acquisitive consumption.
Towards the end of the article, Williams belatedly [suggests that
**alternative platforms** could be constructed in the service of
**non‐capitalistic ends**. Yet, [it\'s **far from clear** how]{.mark}
these "[**socialized**" systems could]{.mark} **ever [be
designed]{.mark}** [and **implemented**, never mind **constitute
any**]{.mark} **sort of [threat]{.mark}** to the monopolistic,
privately‐owned platforms dominating Western societies today, and
**[even if they were]{.mark}**, such a scheme [remains **vulnerable**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the objections of Tiqqun et al. as to [the
foibles of "**[social capitalism]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

**Moreno-Casas, et al, 22**---Department of Applied Economics I, History
and Economic Institutions and Moral Philosophy, Social and Legal
Sciences Faculty, Rey Juan Carlos University (Vicente, with Victor
Espinosa and William Wang, "The political economy of complexity: the
case of Cyber-Communism,"
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4012265, dml)

Cyber-communism is based on computational complexity while advocating
the control of the economy. Cockshott and Cottrell are explicit about
the goal of controlling the economy throughout all their works. That is
to say, the dominant theme in cyber-communism political economy is
control, attributing a strong role to the government (table 2). This may
challenge the complexity political economy we previously presented,
which energetically rejects control and supports cultivation. However,
as we showed in the previous sub-section, [cyber-communism faces
**fundamental problems**]{.underline} in abstract terms even [from a
**computational complexity** view]{.underline}, e.g., self-reference,
[rendering central planning **unfeasible**]{.underline}. From this
automatically follows that [control is **likewise**
impossible]{.underline}, [which **disarticulates the core** of the
cyber-communist political economy]{.underline}. Nevertheless, there is
still a risk that, from any complexity grounded perspective similar to
cybercommunism, one can think that the economy can dispense with
elementary institutions such as money or private property rights. Due to
this risk, we will elaborate here the fundamental problem of
cyber-communism in light of a complexity political economy.

As it can already been inferred, [the main issue with cyber-communism is
its **disregard for institutions**]{.underline}. It outlines a socialist
system in which private ownership of the means of production and money
are abolished, and the state becomes the owner of the means of
production while labor certificates perform the role of money for
consumer goods. The same happens to the figure of the entrepreneur,
which Cottrell and Cockshott want to replace by a combination of expert
opinion and democratic methods. [They propose this alternative social
organization **without barely analyzing** the relevance of these
institutions and the **possible consequences** of substituting
them]{.underline}. [They **assume** that their designed institutions
will work **even more efficiently** than current market
institutions]{.underline}. The reason for this disregard for
institutions is their skepticism about the evolutionary view of the
economy. Cottrell and Cockshott (1997a) criticize Hayek for marking
superficial analogies and metaphors in economics from biology. They
assert that, while there can be some parallelisms, evolution in biology
and evolution in economics differ because the economy acts as a single
processor, while this is not the case in biology due to the variety of
species. Along the same lines, the authors then conclude that one cannot
affirm that the capitalist system results from evolution. They make
clear that evolution is not the same as history, and that capitalism is
a historical result, not an evolutionary outcome. This is because an
authentic evolutionary process, they contend, will require a
considerable number of simultaneous economic systems to compete, and, in
history, we only had two systems that competed for a short period of
time, which is not a statistically valid sample.

Contrary to Cockshott and Cottrell, there is a vast literature on the
economy as an evolutionary process, which precisely forms complexity
economics. Many authors have shown the advantages of taking metaphors
from biological process rather than mechanical process to address
economic issues (Hodgson, 1995). One can apply the biological concept of
diversity of species as diversity of products in economics to explain,
for instance, the cause of wealth (Koppl et al., 2015). Moreover, this
evolutionary perspective has usually gone hand in hand with
institutionalism. Both combined allow to understand how change takes
place in the economy through the evolution of its institutions,
conceived as transpersonal coordination mechanisms. These are two
perspectives integrating complexity economics and have helped to
overcome the restrictive and unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical
economics and traditional political economy.

**[Property rights]{.underline}**, **[money]{.underline}**, [and
**entrepreneurship** are institutions emerged through a **long
evolutionary process**]{.underline}. As such, they all embody a great
amount of factual and tacit knowledge, which means that [these
institutions have not been **consciously created**]{.underline}, [but
**spontaneously emerged** from the interaction of millions of
individuals]{.underline} (Hayek, 1973). They allow transpersonal
coordination in complex system notably populated, in the same way that
language does (Horwitz, 1996). [Consciously removing them or other
relevant institutions from the economy]{.underline}, [as cybercommunism
aims to do]{.underline}, [can create **harmful effects** on coordination
among agents]{.underline}, [which can **impair** the emergent process
and algorithmic working of the economy]{.underline}.

From this discussion, it has to be clear that any political economy
claiming to be based on complexity theory, as cyber-communism does,
should take institutions as central, and then cultivation as the
dominant theme. It is contradictory to represent a complexity approach
and not accounting for institutions in the field of political economy.

5\. Conclusion

The introduction of complexity theory into economics can result in
paradigmatic shifts. This article has dealt with the main implications
of complexity theory for political economy from the two most widespread
definitions of complexity in economics: dynamic and computational. In
this way, we have elaborated a complexity political economy focused on
cultivating the economic system rather than controlling it.

[Complexity theory shows that central planning of the economy is
**impossible**]{.underline}, due to the nonequilibrium, nonlinear, or
even chaotic dynamics present in the economy. Ultimately, global
controlling finds that: (1) [optimal parameters **cannot be
computable**]{.underline} due to the problem of selfreference,
[and]{.underline} (2) [the emergent processes feeding economic dynamics
are]{.underline}, **[by definition]{.underline}**, [**not planned** or
**controlled**]{.underline}, [but **spontaneous** or
**self-organized**]{.underline}. These findings clash with neoclassical
political economy, which beliefs in effective control of the economy due
to its equilibrium and mechanistic approach to economic science.
Consequently, complexity political economy moves away from mainstream
political economy, from its focus on the control of variables, and puts
the spotlight on the cultivation of an environment, of institutions and
transpersonal mechanisms, which allow the algorithmic operation of the
economy and the emergence of new processes. Cultivation, as the central
concept for a complexity political economy, warns us that [the economy
is **not a perfect mechanism** that can be effectively manipulated
**without causing harmful consequences**]{.underline}, [drawing our
attention to **take care** of economic institutions such as **private
property rights** or **money**]{.underline}.

From this complexity political economy, we have analyzed the political
economy of cybercommunism. As shown, despite relying on technological
advances in computation and simulation and even sharing a computational
complexity view of the economy, cyber-communism advocates 23 the control
of the economy. In believing in global optimizations and computation,
[cybercommunist theory]{.underline} does not realize the
noncomputability of optimal outcomes, the problem of self-reference
parallel to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and the emergent,
self-organized processes of the economy. At the same time, it [**does
not recognize** the importance of institutions such as private property
rights or money and tries to manipulate them **without accounting for
the dire consequences** their control may have for the operation of the
economic system]{.underline}. Thus, cybercommunism appears closer to the
mainstream, traditional political economy of control than to a
complexity political economy of cultivation. Ultimately, complexity
theory and complexity political economy show that **[any implementation
of the cyber-communist ideal is doomed to failure]{.underline}**.

This work also responds to a more general question: can advances in
computer technology ease central planning? As shown, [central planning
or global optimizations of the economy are **not possible**]{.underline}
in light of complexity theory, [**not** due to a **technological** or
**practical issue**]{.underline}, [but due to **ontological** and
**epistemological reasons** related to the nature of complex systems and
the cognitive limitations of the human mind]{.underline}. In this sense,
this article may prompt those who seek to control or model the economy
through technology and computation from alternative perspectives to
cyber-communism to consider the noncomputability of optimal parameters
and the emergent dynamics of the economy, which cannot be fully
anticipated. Additionally, the complexity political economy outlined
here, emphasizing the notion of cultivation, can be used in future works
on political economy aiming to consistently follow the principles of
complexity economics. It can also support a great deal of research on
the role of institutions as transpersonal mechanisms in the economy,
such as agent-based models.

**Visoka, 19**---Associate Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at
Dublin City University (Gëzim, "Critique and Alternativity in
International Relations," International Studies Review, Volume 21, Issue
4, December 2019, 678-704, dml)

Critical IR theory needs to make more space for self-reflexivity and to
open up to an epistemic transformation. The preceding discussion
demonstrated that although peace and conflict studies are more pluralist
than other [critical IR branches]{.underline}, they [are]{.underline}
still [affected by paradigmatic and disciplinary divides]{.underline}
within IR. [They operate in a conflictual theorizing logic that
**disregards** certain ontological, methodological, and epistemological
alternatives in order to **remain loyal** to one particular
disciplinarity]{.underline}. For Laura Sjoberg (2017, 163--67),
"disciplinarity has a narrowing effect," suggesting that "an
undisciplined IR would free space for more radical critique and more
radical experimentation." [[Disciplinary encampment]{.underline}]{.mark}
among different branches of critical IR [[has **suffocated** the search
for **achievable emancipatory possibilities**]{.mark} across a different
range of cases. Endorsing [alternativity requires]{.mark} a **fluid
onto-epistemology** that would make it possible to **bypass** the
epistemological entrapments caused by **rigid academic rules** of
thought and of knowledge production]{.underline} and by the academic
research process. Nonconflictual pathways of research would be
beneficial for overcoming paradigmatic contempt, bypassing
methodological holism and individualism, and [making space for
[**conciliatory heuristics** and **reality-congruent
inquires**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Archer 1995; Hamati-Ataya 2018).
Searching for nonconflictual critiques that are embedded in
postparadigmatic logic means generating conceptually novel and
reality-congruent knowledge about conflict-affected societies and the
broader politics of international interventions. This should not be seen
as an attempt to discipline the discipline of peacebuilding studies. On
the contrary, it would be an attempt to break away from disciplinary
entrenchments that have impeded a better understanding of complexity in
postconflict societies. It would also be an attempt to avoid the
normalization of entrenched research programs and open up the politics
of knowledge production on peace, conflict, security, justice, and
development.

More broadly, [alternativity in critical IR theory needs to be rescued
from **never-ending conceptual reifications**, which have ended up
making ontological assentation about the world become **completely
detached** from the world]{.underline}. In this regard, [there is a
growing realization]{.underline} in IR [that "[critique is]{.mark} a
[**necessary** but **secondary**]{.mark} task; [the priority is]{.mark}
to **return to [practical theory as quickly as
possible]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Levine 2012, 69). [Recalibrating the
purpose of alternativity in critical theory requires recalibrating
knowledge production, not only to **unmask** power relations and the
dynamics of dominance and to **create space** for a politics of
resistance but also to **generate practical knowledge** for political
action that challenges, confronts, and disrupts existing power relations
and **offers alternative solutions** for reshuffling social relations on
more emancipatory and inclusive terms]{.underline} (see Duvall and
Varadarajan 2003, 85; Murdie 2017; Deiana and McDonagh 2018). A feature
of critical peace and conflict studies is a congruence between the
emancipatory and problem-solving perspectives, which should be
predicated on the conciliation of knowledge, the expansion of
onto-politics of peace, and the pluralization of epistemological and
methodological approaches. The recent methodological work by J. Samuel
Barkin and Laura Sjoberg (2017) on interpretive quantification is a
promising move toward this much-needed pluralist fertilization within
critical theory. In particular, [a stronger linkage between criticality,
alternativity, and [practicality]{.mark} could]{.underline} help
critical security, peace, and conflict theories to [offer alternatives
that would **[maintain critical impetus]{.mark}** while **simultaneously
strengthening ties** to practical and societal problem-addressing
solutions]{.underline}. Genealogical [studies would blend well with a
critical analysis of conceptual and policy alternatives]{.underline}
(see Milliken 1999). Statistical analysis with an emancipatory
hypothesis coupled with critical analysis would contribute to subverting
policy practices and would normalize alternative knowledge about peace,
justice, and emancipation.

[The]{.underline} recent [practice-turn in IR offers new
bridges]{.underline} between scholars and practitioners, [making it
possible to translate critical knowledge into practice **without
compromising** the normativity and criticality of scholarly
works]{.underline} (see Bigo 2011). A forum on pragmatism published in
this journal has implicitly highlighted [the importance of
**alternativity**]{.underline} in understanding global politics and
generating impactful knowledge beyond the existing epistemological and
methodological divides (see Hellmann 2009). Friedrichs and Kratochwil
(2009, 701) have [argued for "the orientation of research toward the
**generation of useful knowledge**." Practicality is **essential** for
generating alternatives]{.underline}. For instance, Jonna Nyman (2016,
142) argues that "[a **pragmatic**, **practice-centred
approach**]{.underline} . . . [can help us gain practical knowledge of
how security works and understand the value of security better, as well
as help us to suggest alternative possibilities]{.underline}."
Similarly, Navnita Chadha Behera (2016, 154) argues: "[theorizing in IR
needs to step out of the rarefied atmosphere of its academe, develop a
healthy scepticism toward its canonical frames, and open up to the
possibilities of learning from everyday life]{.underline} and
experiences of people and their living traditions and practices."
Practicality shifts the focus from abstract criticality and normativity
to contextual critiques that account for everyday practices and
interactions. This would be essential for rescuing critique from
becoming a postempirical endeavor.

[Critical [knowledge that **engages with policy alternatives**]{.mark}
"is not only **pragmatic**, it [is also **politically enabling**: it
forces us **away from instrumental**]{.mark} **problem-solving
[perspectives]{.mark}** [towards a **wider framework**]{.mark} of
pragmatic thought where narrow instrumental goals are **overridden** by
wider normative and political concerns"]{.underline} (Kurki 2013, 260).
[Such grounded critiques are **crucial** in order to **expand
non-prescriptive alternativity** and **exploring practical
possibilities** for social emancipation and change]{.underline}. For
Steve Smith (2002: 202), "[[the **acid test** for the **success** of
alternative]{.mark} and critical [approaches is the **extent** to which
they have led to **empirically grounded work**]{.mark} that explores the
**range** and **variety** of world politics]{.underline}." This would
also be congruent with Daniel Levine\'s (2012, 30) concept of
[sustainable critique]{.underline}, which [entails [thinking in **both
practical** and **critical terms at once**]{.mark} so that "IR could
[create a **sustainably critical perspective**]{.mark} on global
politics [that might]{.mark} then [be **turned back onto**, and]{.mark}
**made to [inform]{.mark}**, **ongoing [policy
debates]{.mark}**]{.underline} and discourses." Behera (2016, 154)
further maintains that the "state-centric ontology of IR has effectively
ended up dehumanizing the discipline in a way so that normally it has
little to do with human relations, human needs, and the larger
imperatives of humanity." Generating practical alternatives would
therefore require endorsing situated knowledge as an epistemological and
methodological basis for any engagement with the real world. The work of
feminists such as Donna Haraway (1988, 584) on situated standpoints is
also relevant here because they offer "more adequate, sustained,
objective, transforming accounts of the world." Situated knowledge is,
mostly, nonrepresentational knowledge, in that it is not firmly mediated
through preexisting discourses. In this regard, promoting subjugated
knowledge discourses and practices could be central to rejuvenating the
emancipatory commitment of critical theory (see Doty 1996).

Situated alternatives could derive from emplaced and embodied knowledge
and could have a more emancipatory character as they "bring forth the
importance of recognizing, valuing, and employing marginalized voices by
working from this perspective, as well as by reshaping research to
include marginalized communities as part of knowledge production"
(McHugh 2015, 62). For Robson and McCartan (2016, 3), "[real world
[research]{.mark} looks to examine personal experience, social life and
social systems, as well as **related policies** and **initiatives**. It
[endeavours to **understand**]{.mark}]{.underline} the lived in reality
of people in society and its **[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Milja Kurki\'s (2013, 245) recent study of democracy promotion has
approached alternativity from the perspective of [policy
provocations]{.underline}, which [focus "on **not prioritising** one or
another perspective, but rather on encouraging
self-reflection]{.underline} by all practitioners, [which]{.underline}
in turn [is]{.underline} considered as [a key condition of seeking
adequately pluralism-fostering reforms [in **concrete policy
frameworks**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Kurki (2013, 248--51) further
maintains that "instead of relying on objective knowledge and criteria,
policy process can and should be attuned to the logic of interpretive,
politicised and participatory judgements." Her study is an excellent
example of [pragmatic]{.underline} congruence between criticality and
alternativity, whereby [policy alternatives are not geared toward
**totally improving** or **enhancing** the current system but openly
promote more pluralistic, reflexive, and emancipatory
policies]{.underline} for democratization and peacebuilding.

Moreover, for these new grounds of critical alternativity to be
introduced in practice, knowledge production should be decentered,
decolonized, and "de-methodolised" (see Lisle 2014). R. B. J. Walker
(2002, 265) has argued that "the key achievement of supposedly
alternative and critical literatures over the past two decades has been
to open up at least some possibility of asking questions about the
location and character of the political." As elaborated in this study,
knowledge production in peace and conflict studies is predominantly
based on Western epistemologies, which are shaped by specific cultures
of thought, self-perpetuated epistemological superiority, and codified
academic practices. Most of the international scholarship on
postconflict societies derives from an unrepresentative body of
knowledge, which tries to mediate, deviate, reinterpret, and,
consequently, construct a different social reality that is interpreted
through different measurements, reference points, and analytical
concepts (see Latour 2005). This has greatly limited the possibility for
proposing realizable alternatives. Due to these epistemological
anomalies, there are growing calls in scholarship to decolonize
knowledge from Eurocentric and Western dominance and instead to pursue
more pluralist and particularist modes of knowledge (Smith 2012). For
instance, Acharya and Buzan (2010, 2) have argued that IR theory should
be "an open domain into which it is not unreasonable to expect
non-Westerners to make a contribution at least proportional to the
degree that they are involved in its practice." Similarly, Andrew
Hurrell (2016, 151) has proposed that "the pathway to a global IR will
need to look beyond 'IR' and is likely to require new models for
organizing social science research and knowledge production."
Decolonized epistemologies of peace would reverse the order of
knowledge, placing the local first and then the regional and
international as spatial and ontological scales for understanding peace
processes (Visoka 2017). They would not operate in isolation but would
engage in shaping global IR knowledge. Therefore, a genuine search for
achievable alternatives should try to decolonize peace knowledge from
Western and Eurocentric frameworks, interrogate decolonized knowledge
and agencies, and explore the joint constitution of international
intervention and local resistance (see Smith 2012; Memmi 2006). Local
scholars often have rich knowledge, but the primary usage of it is not
for instrumental purposes or for transferring and sharing with audiences
of outsiders. Local knowledge is very much used to respond to narrow
practical and everyday interests and needs and, as such, is embedded in
the logic of generating sufficient knowledge to respond to specific
circumstances.

In the context of peacebuilding, as examined in this article, generating
alternatives from the ground up has the potential to bring about more
sustainable forms of peace and reconciliation for groups and societies
affected by violent conflict. Situated alternatives for emancipatory
peace are more prone to avoiding co-optation by positivist and
problem-solving epistemic predators, resulting thus in developing
pluriversal political and peace orders beyond liberal peacebuilding and
other Eurocentric impositions. From this situated perspective,
emancipation could take the shape of "the transformation of structures
and relationships of vulnerability through localized political action,
aimed at the creation of spaces in people\'s lives so that they are
enabled to make decisions and act beyond mere survival" (Basu and Nunes
2013, 69). [[Emancipatory alternatives **would not be
universal**]{.mark} in their applications because [such an attempt is
**not viable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather [[the focus should
be]{.mark} on searching for **[practical]{.mark} emancipatory
[possibilities]{.mark}** [within a **given
context**]{.mark}]{.underline}, time, space, and place (see Fierke 2007,
24). In other words, [critiques with an adequate dose of alternativity
are more likely to generate **globally understandable** and **locally
impactful knowledge**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [alternativity does
not necessarily have to be predicated on]{.underline} representative
[**views** of the world---it can also be a by-product of
performing]{.underline} hope and [**imagined possibilities** in global
politics]{.underline}. Shapiro (2013, xiv) argues that critical thinking
helps to "create the conditions of possibility for imaging alternative
worlds." That said, as the purpose of critical theory is emancipatory
change, any alternative theoretical and empirical observation in service
of improving the human conditions should generate a morally and
practically acceptable standpoint. Because any attempt to establish an
alternative interpretation inevitably "empowers a particular social and
political standpoint" (Price and Reus-Smit 1998, 261). According to Ní
Mhurchú and Shindo (2016, 5), "critique can help us to develop different
ways of talking about, evaluating, doing and interrogating the changing
nature of politics, relations and experiences of the international in a
globalising world." Hence, critique is inevitably implicated in
world-making and, with a much clearer understanding of alternativity,
can steer the thrust for world-changing in a more emancipatory, just,
and inclusive direction.

Conclusion

[Emancipation is a central feature of critical IR debates, but scholars
often **fail to develop alternatives** or **solutions** achieving
emancipation in practice]{.underline}. This article has examined the
relationship between criticality and alternativity in IR in order to
shed light on some of the most contested issues of critical theory,
namely, the epistemological pathways for identifying the inconsistencies
and flaws in existing knowledge and practices and the extent to which
critical knowledge should generate alternative emancipatory
possibilities. The article has argued that alternativity provides an
opportunity for critical scholars to remain relevant without being
affiliated with positivist logics of inquiry. In unpacking the
conceptual contours, the article first explored how different branches
of critical IR engage with the episteme of alternativity. The analysis
found that although alternativity is often affiliated with
problem-solving epistemologies, it has played a major role in shaping
critical knowledge in IR. While this is acknowledged and endorsed at the
epistemological level by a branch of critical scholars who engage in
normative and reconstructive modes of critique, other scholars embedded
in deconstructive modes of critique have disregarded the merits of
alternativity in IR. The article has argued that, [**contrary** to what
is often assumed, [alternativity is **not incompatible**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} deconstructive or reconstructive
[[critiques]{.mark} across different subdisciplines of IR. [Yet
critical]{.mark} IR [debates]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have now become
the new mainstream in IR, [have **failed to engage** with the episteme
of alternativity in a more empirical and practical sense. They [preach
emancipation but **fail to develop tangible**]{.mark} **emancipatory
[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As a result, there is a growing realization that, [without tangible
alternativity]{.underline}, [critical [theory risks **losing
its**]{.mark} **normative impetus** and its **[ethical]{.mark}** and
**emancipatory [commitment]{.mark}**, potentially becoming a
post-epistemological vocation **without politics**]{.underline}.
[Critical [knowledge]{.mark} without a dose of alternativity [may
**examine the causes**]{.mark} and **consequences** of subject matters
[but]{.mark} could [**fall short** of reaching out to the]{.mark} wider
[policy community]{.mark} and the affected subjects where power
relations reside]{.underline}, thus [[**missing the opportunity** to
transform the]{.underline}]{.mark} structural, discursive, and
performative [[practices that reproduce violence]{.mark}, inequality,
and injustice]{.underline} on human and nonhuman ecology. To bridge this
epistemological gap, the analysis in the second part of this article
examined how alternativity features in peace and conflict studies, a
disciplinary field known for adding normative, empirical, and practical
substance to critical IR debates. The analysis offered a conceptual
scoping of three modes of critique and alternativity in peace and
conflict studies. The three modes of critique showed that [a conjunction
between criticality and alternativity is possible]{.underline} and that
it is necessary to renew the practical and emancipatory potential of
critical theory in IR. The three modes of alternativity in peace and
conflict studies expose a spectrum of different critiques, ranging from
those perspectives that disengage completely from conceptual and
empirical alternatives, to more pragmatic and prescriptive approaches.

[Critique-without-alternative]{.underline} represents one strand, which
[tends to **avoid** offering normative and practical alternatives to
their critical reflections aimed at maintaining the conservative and
radical impetus of critical theory and **dissociating** from
problem-solving and policy-relevant methods of inquiry. This mode of
critique]{.underline} is committed to revealing the weaknesses of
peacebuilding interventions but [**refuses** to offer any emancipatory
and practical alternative]{.underline} on how to build sustainable peace
after violent conflict. If the end goal of critical perspectives is
achieving emancipation, then [[critique should **not only** be]{.mark}
directed toward [problematizing dominant]{.mark} discourses, practices,
and [policies but also needs to **envisage**]{.mark} **political** and
**[practical alternatives]{.mark}** rooted in ideational and material
elements]{.underline}. In turn, [[the lack of an explicit]{.mark}
emancipatory [agenda **limits their**]{.mark} **social** and **political
[impact]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **unintentionally [validates]{.mark}**
[the existing order]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response to this challenge,
a new mode of critique has emerged, namely,
[critique-as-alternative]{.underline}, which exemplifies the optimal
approach. Proponents of critique-as-alternative have remained committee
to critical analysis, but most importantly, they [have taken up the
challenge of]{.underline} offering emancipatory knowledge that has
[practical relevance]{.underline} for vulnerable societies in global
politics. [Their main flaw]{.underline}, however, [has been their
**inability to elaborate sufficiently** their practical and emancipatory
alternatives]{.underline}---a flaw that has opened up space for
epistemic contestation and policy co-optation. Finally, the third mode
of critique---critique-with-alternative---which is embedded in a
positivist, problem-solving, and policy-driven logic of inquiry, offers
alternatives that seek either to verify existing knowledge and the
existing interventionary order or to reject other critical alternatives.

Looking at different modes of critique through the lens of alternativity
in IR\'s subdiscipline of peace and conflict studies has provided
interesting insights on the promise and limits of critical IR in shaping
global politics. The analysis found that existing modes of critique have
failed to develop elaborative emancipatory alternatives at both the
conceptual and the practical levels. To infuse critique-with-alternative
with emancipatory elements, expand the epistemological scope of
critique-without-alternative, and operationalize further the practical
solutions offered by this mode of critique, substantial changes are
needed. This article has suggested exploring postparadigmatic approaches
of inquiry in order to avoid existing epistemological entrapments and
limitations, reclaiming the practical relevance of critical theory
through pragmatic, reflexive, and situated alternatives---across the
conceptual, normative, and empirical spectrums---and promoting
decolonized, bottom-up methods of knowledge production. The existing
modes of critique require pursuing more nonconflictual and
postparadigmatic epistemologies, embracing situated knowledge and
reclaiming and expanding its practical relevance, breaking away from
geo-epistemological hierarchies, and opening up to post-Western IR. To
conclude, [promoting [alternativity has the potential to **rejuvenate
critical scholarship**]{.mark} embedded in the ethos of impactful
engagement with the world [**without being co-opted** by the policy
world. The]{.mark}]{.underline} next [[challenge]{.mark} for scholars
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} not [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} whether
alternativity and criticality are congruent but
[[how]{.underline}]{.mark} emancipatory [[alternatives]{.mark}
can]{.underline} renew the social and political purpose of critical
theory and [**[make an impact]{.mark}** in the real world]{.underline}.

### AT: Ethics/Human Meaning/Value To Life/Etc

#### Technics won't subjugate humanity---we can adapt. Their impact is doomsaying.

**Thierer, 14**---senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at
George Mason University (Adam, "Muddling Through: How We Learn to Cope
with Technological Change,"
<https://techliberation.com/2014/06/17/muddling-through-how-we-learn-to-cope-with-technological-change/>,
dml)

These [critics worried about the subjugation of humans to]{.underline}
"technique" or "**[technics]{.underline}**" [and feared
that]{.underline} technology and [technological processes would come to
**control** us]{.underline} before we learned how to control them. Media
theorist Neil Postman was the most notable of the modern information
technology critics and served as the bridge between the industrial era
critics (like Ellul, Spengler, and Mumford) and some of [today's digital
age skeptics]{.underline} (like Evgeny Morozov and Nick Carr). Postman
[decried]{.underline} the rise of a "technopoly" --- "[the submission
of]{.underline} all forms of [cultural life to the sovereignty of
technique]{.underline} and technology" --- [that would
destroy]{.underline} "[the **vital sources** of our
humanity]{.underline}" [and lead to]{.underline} "[a culture **without a
moral foundation**]{.underline}" [by undermining]{.underline} "certain
[mental processes and social relations that **make human life worth
living**]{.underline}." We see that attitude on display in countless
works of technological criticism since then.

Of course, there's been some pushback from some futurists and
technological enthusiasts. But there's often a fair amount of irrational
exuberance at work in their tracts and punditry. Many self-proclaimed
"futurists" have predicted that various new technologies would produce a
nirvana that would overcome human want, suffering, ignorance, and more.

In a 2010 essay, I labeled these two camps technological "pessimists"
and "optimists." It was a crude and overly-simplistic dichotomy, but it
was an attempt to begin sketching out a rough taxonomy of the
personalities and perspectives that we often seen pitted against each
other in debates about the impact of technology on culture and humanity.

Sadly, when I wrote that earlier piece, I was not aware of a similar
(and much better) framing of this divide that was developed by science
writer Joel Garreau in his terrific 2005 book, Radical Evolution: The
Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies --- and What It
Means to Be Human. In that book, Garreau is thinking in much grander
terms about technology and the future than I was in my earlier essay. He
was focused on how various emerging technologies might be changing our
very humanity and he notes that narratives about these issues are
typically framed in "Heaven" versus "Hell" scenarios.

Under the "Heaven" scenario, technology drives history relentlessly, and
in almost every way for the better. As Garreau describes the beliefs of
the Heaven crowd, they believe that going forward, "almost unimaginably
good things are happening, including the conquering of disease and
poverty, but also an increase in beauty, wisdom, love, truth, and
peace." (p. 130) By contrast, under the "Hell" scenario, "technology is
used for extreme evil, threatening humanity with extinction." (p. 95)
Garreau notes that what unifies the Hell scenario theorists is the sense
that in "wresting power from the gods and seeking to transcend the human
condition," we end up instead creating a monster --- or maybe many
different monsters --- that threatens our very existence. Garreau says
this "Frankenstein Principle" can be seen in countless works of
literature and technological criticism throughout history, and it is
still very much with us today. (p. 108)

Theories of Collapse: Why Does Doomsaying Dominate Discussions about New
Technologies?

Indeed, in examining the way new technologies and inventions have long
divided philosophers, scientists, pundits, and the general public, [one
can find **countless examples** of that sort of fear and loathing at
work]{.underline}. "Armageddon has a long and distinguished history,"
Garreau notes. "Theories of progress are mirrored by theories of
collapse." (p. 149)

In that regard, Garreau rightly cites Arthur Herman's magisterial
history of apocalyptic theories, The Idea of Decline in Western History,
which documents "declinism" over time. [The **irony** of much of this
pessimistic declinist thinking]{.underline}, Herman notes, [is
that]{.underline}:

In effect, [the very things modern society does **best**]{.underline}
--- [providing increasing **economic affluence**]{.underline},
**[equality of opportunity]{.underline}**, [and **social** and
**geographic mobility**]{.underline} --- [are **systematically
deprecated** and **vilified** by its direct beneficiaries]{.underline}.
None of this is new or even remarkable." (p. 442)

Why is that? Why has the "Hell" scenario been such a dominant
reoccurring theme in past writing and commentary throughout history,
even though the general trend has been steady improvements in human
health, welfare, and convenience?

There must be something deeply rooted in the human psyche that accounts
for this tendency. As I have discussed in my new book as well as my big
"Technopanics" law review article, [our **innate tendency** to be
pessimistic but also want to be **certain** about the future means
that]{.underline} "[the gloom-mongers **have it easy**]{.underline}," as
author Dan Gardner argues in his book, Future Babble: Why Expert
Predictions Are Next to Worthless, and You Can Do Better. He continues
on to note of the **[techno-doomsday]{.underline}** pundits:

Their [predictions are supported by our **intuitive
pessimism**]{.underline}, [so they **feel right** to us]{.underline}.
[And that conclusion is **bolstered** by our attraction to
certainty]{.underline}. As strange as it sounds, we want to believe the
expert predicting a dark future is exactly right, because knowing that
the future will be dark is less tormenting than suspecting it. Certainty
is always preferable to uncertainty, even when what's certain is
disaster. (p. 140-1)

Similarly, in his new book, Smarter Than You Think: How Technology Is
Changing Our Minds for the Better, Clive Thompson notes that "[dystopian
predictions are **easy to generate**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[doomsaying is **emotionally self-protective**]{.underline}: [if you
complain that]{.underline} today's [technology is wrecking the
culture]{.underline}, [you can tell yourself you're a **gimlet-eyed
critic** who **isn't hoodwinked** by high-tech trends]{.underline} and
silly, popular activities like social networking. You seem like someone
who has a richer, deeper appreciation for the past and who stands above
the triviality of today's life." (p. 283)

Another explanation is that humans are sometimes very poor judges of the
relative risks to themselves or those close to them. Harvard University
psychology professor Steven Pinker, author of The Blank Slate: The
Modern Denial of Human Nature, notes:

The mind is more comfortable in reckoning probabilities in terms of the
relative frequency of remembered or imagined events. That can make
recent and memorable events---a plane crash, a shark attack, an anthrax
infection---loom larger in one's worry list than more frequent and
boring events, such as the car crashes and ladder falls that get printed
beneath the fold on page B14. And it can lead risk experts to speak one
language and ordinary people to hear another. (p. 232)

Put simply, there exists a wide variety of explanations for why our
collective first reaction to new technologies often is one of dystopian
dread. In my work, I have identified several other factors, including:
generational differences; hyper-nostalgia; media sensationalism; special
interest pandering to stoke fears and sell products or services; elitist
attitudes among intellectuals; and the so-called "third-person effect
hypothesis," which posits that when some people encounter perspectives
or preferences at odds with their own, they are more likely to be
concerned about the impact of those things on others throughout society
and to call on government to "do something" to correct or counter those
perspectives or preferences.

Some combination of these factors ends up driving the initial resistance
we have see to new technologies that disrupted long-standing social
norms, traditions, and institutions. In the extreme, it results in that
gloom-and-doom, sky-is-falling disposition in which we are repeatedly
told how humanity is about to be steam-rolled by some new invention or
technological development.

The "Prevail" (or "Muddling Through") Scenario

"The good news is that [end-of-the-world predictions have been around
for a **very long time**]{.underline}, [and **none** of them has yet
borne fruit]{.underline}," Garreau reminds us. (p. 148) Why not? Let's
get back to his framework for the answer. After discussing the "Heaven"
(optimistic) and "Hell" (skeptical or pessimistic) scenarios cast about
by countless tech writers throughout history, Garreau outlines
[a]{.underline} third, and **[more pragmatic]{.underline}** "Prevail"
[option]{.underline}, which [views history]{.underline}
"[as]{.underline} a remarkably effective paean to [the power of humans
to **muddle through** extraordinary circumstances]{.underline}."

That pretty much sums up my own perspective on things, and in the
remainder of this essay I want sketch out the reasons why I think the
"prevail" or "**[muddling through]{.underline}**" scenario [offers the
**best explanation** for how we learn to cope with technological
disruption and prosper in the process]{.underline}.

As Garreau explains it, under the "Prevail" scenario, "[humans shape and
adapt]{.underline} \[[technology]{.underline}\] [in **entirely new
directions**]{.underline}." (p. 95) "[Just because the **problems** are
increasing doesn't mean **solutions** might not **also** be increasing
to match them]{.underline}," he rightly notes. (p. 154) As John Seely
Brown and Paul Duguid noted in their excellent 2001, "Response to Bill
Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists":

[technological and social systems shape each other]{.underline}. [The
same is true on a larger scale]{.underline}. \[...\] Technology and
society are constantly forming and reforming new dynamic equilibriums
with far-reaching implications. [The challenge]{.underline} for
futurology (and for all of us) [is to see **beyond the hype** and **past
the over-simplifications** to the full import of these new
sociotechnical formations]{.underline}. [Social and technological
systems do not develop independently]{.underline}; the two evolve
together in complex feedback loops, wherein [each drives]{.underline},
[restrains and accelerates change in the other]{.underline}.

It is this process of "constantly forming and reforming new dynamic
equilibriums" that interests me most. In a recent exchange with Michael
Sacasas -- one of the most thoughtful modern technology critics I've
come across --- I noted that the nature of individual and societal
acclimation to technological change is worthy of serious investigation
if for no other reason that it has continuously happened! What I hope to
better understand is the process by which [we humans have **again** and
**again** figured out how to assimilate new technologies]{.underline}
into their lives [**despite** how much those]{.underline} technologies
[disrupted our personal]{.underline}, [social]{.underline},
[economic]{.underline}, [cultural]{.underline}, [and legal
norms]{.underline}.

In a response to me, Sacasas put forth the following admonition: "That
people eventually acclimate to changes precipitated by the advent of a
new technology does not prove that the changes were inconsequential or
benign." This is undoubtedly true, but it does not undermine the reality
of societal adaptation. What can we learn from this? What were the
mechanics of that adaptive process? As social norms, personal habits,
and human relationships were disrupted, what helped us muddle through
and find a way of coping with new technologies? Likewise, as existing
markets and business models were disrupted, how were new ones formulated
in response to the given technological disruption? Finally, how did
legal norms and institutions adjust to those same changes?

Of course, this raises an entirely different issue: What metrics are we
using to judge whether "the changes were inconsequential or benign"? As
I noted in my exchange with Sacasas, at the end of the day, it may be
that we won't be able to even agree on a standard by which to make that
judgment and will instead have to settle for a rough truce about what
history has to teach us that might be summed up by the phrase:
"something gained, something lost."

Resiliency: Why Do the Skeptics Never Address It (and Its Benefits)?

Nonetheless, I believe that [while technological change often brings
**sweeping** and **quite consequential** change]{.underline}, there is
great value in the very act of living through it.

In my work, including my latest little book, I argue that [humans have
exhibited the uncanny ability to **adapt** to changes in their
environment]{.underline}, [**bounce back** from adversity]{.underline},
[and learn to be **resilient** over time]{.underline}. A great deal of
wisdom is born of experience, including experiences that involve risk
and the possibility of occasional mistakes and failures while both
developing new technologies and learning how to live with them. I
believe it wise to continue to be open to [new forms of innovation and
technological change]{.underline}, not only because it [provides
**breathing space** for future entrepreneurialism and
invention]{.underline}, but also because it provides an opportunity to
see how societal attitudes toward new technologies evolve --- and to
learn from it. **[More often than not]{.underline}**, I argue, [citizens
have found ways to adapt to technological change by employing a variety
of **coping mechanisms**]{.underline}, **[new norms]{.underline}**, [or
**other creative fixes**]{.underline}.

What we're talking about here is resiliency. Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie
Healy, authors of Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back, define resilience
as "the capacity of a system, enterprise, or a person to maintain its
core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatically changed
circumstances." (p. 7) "To improve your resilience," they note, "is to
enhance your ability to resist being pushed from your preferred valley,
while expanding the range of alternatives that you can embrace if you
need to. This is what researchers call preserving adaptive
capacity---the ability to adapt to changed circumstances while
fulfilling once core purpose---and it's an essential skill in an age of
unforeseeable disruption and volatility." (p. 7-8, emphasis in original)
Moreover, they note, "by encouraging adaptation, agility, cooperation,
connectivity, and diversity, resilience-thinking can bring us to a
different way of being in the world, and to a deeper engagement with
it." (p. 16)

Even if you one doesn't agree with all of that, again, I would think one
would find great value in studying the process by which such adaptation
happens precisely because it does happen so regularly. And then we could
argue about whether it was all really worth it! Specially, was it worth
whatever we lost in the process (i.e., a change in our old moral norms,
our old privacy norms, our old institutions, our old business models,
our old laws, or whatever else)?

As Sacasas correctly argues, "That people before us experienced similar
problems does not mean that they magically cease being problems today."
Again, quite right. On the other hand, the fact that people and
institutions learned to cope with those concerns and become more
resilient over time is worthy of serious investigation because somehow
we "muddled through" before and we'll have to muddle through again. And,
again, what we learned from living through that process may be extremely
valuable in its own right.

Of Course, Muddling Through Isn't Always Easy

Now, let's be honest about [this process of]{.underline} "[muddling
through]{.underline}": it isn't always neat or pretty. To put it
crudely, [sometimes]{.underline} muddling through **[really
sucks]{.underline}**! Think about the modern technologies that violate
our visceral sense of privacy and personal space today. I am an
intensely private person and if I had a life motto it would probably be:
"Leave Me Alone!" Yet, [sometimes there's **just no escaping** the
pervasive reach of modern technologies and processes]{.underline}. [On
the other hand]{.underline}, I know that, like [so many]{.underline}
others, I [derive **amazing benefits** from all these new
technologies]{.underline}, too. So, like [most]{.underline} everyone
else I [put up with the downsides because]{.underline}, **[on
net]{.underline}**, [there are **generally more upsides**]{.underline}.

[Almost **every** digital service]{.underline} that we use today
[presents]{.underline} us with [these **trade-offs**]{.underline}. For
example, email has allowed us to connect with a constantly growing
universe of our fellow humans and organizations. Yet, spam clutters our
mailboxes and the sheer volume of email we get sometimes overwhelms us.
Likewise, in just the past five years, smartphones have transformed our
lives in so many ways for the better in terms of not just personal
convenience but also personal safety. On the other hand, smartphones
have become more than a bit of nuisance in certain environments
(theaters, restaurants, and other closed spaces.) And they also put our
safety at risk when we use them while driving automobiles.

But, again, [we **adjust** to most of these new realities and then we
find **constructive solutions** to the really hard problems]{.underline}
-- yes, [and that sometimes includes **legal remedies** to rectify
serious harms]{.underline}. But a certain amount of social adaptation
will, nonetheless, be required. Law can only slightly slow that
inevitability; it can't stop it entirely. And [as **messy** and
**uncomfortable** as muddling through can be]{.underline}, [we have
to]{.underline} (a) [be aware of what we **gain** in the process
and]{.underline} (b) ask ourselves what [the **cost** of taking the
alternative path]{.underline} would be. [Attempts to]{.underline}
through a wrench in the works and [**derail** new innovations or
**delay**]{.underline} various types of [technological
change]{.underline} are always going to be tempting, but such
interventions will [come at a **very steep cost**]{.underline}: **[less
entreprenurialism]{.underline}**, **[diminished
competition]{.underline}**, **[stagnant markets]{.underline}**,
**[higher prices]{.underline}**, [and **fewer choices** for
citizens]{.underline}. As I note in my new book, [if we spend all our
time living in **constant fear** of worst-case scenarios]{.underline}
--- and premising public policy upon such fears --- it means that [many
best-case scenarios will **never come about**]{.underline}.

### AT: K Isn't Deterministic

#### It's not just about their intent---their [point]{.underline} is that the alt spills over in unpredictable ways, [our]{.underline} point is that one of the [more predictable ways]{.underline} is that it can [all too easily tilt]{.underline} into [deterministic pessimism]{.underline}!

**Loeb, 21**---Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania
(Zachary, "Theses on Technological Pessimism,"
<https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2021/07/08/theses-on-technological-pessimism/>,
dml)

Scratch its surface and it becomes apparent fairly rapidly that [most
technological pessimism has **less** to do with technology than it may
initially appear]{.underline}. Of course, [the **objects** and
**systems** that are held up for critique may be clearly
technological]{.underline}, [but the **goals** of the critiques are to
pierce deeper]{.underline}. [Technological pessimism is **social**
critique disguised as **technological** critique]{.underline}. Thus,
what may appear as a tirade against nuclear weapons can most fully be
understood as a tirade against the dangerous union of military and
industry, what may look like a woebegone assessment of the technological
forces exacerbating climate change can best be understood as a way of
discussing the economic drives that led to the particular technological
status, and commentary on social media platforms has less to do with
retweets and likes than it has to do with an attempt to describe what
happens to a society that becomes fixated on retweets and likes. Of
course, technological pessimism is largely about technology (it's right
there in the name!); however, [directing attention to a technology that
appears at the surface level is a way of getting at deeper
issues]{.underline}.

Whereas technological optimism focuses its hopes on the idea that
technology provides an easy way of getting around complex
social/historical/economic/political challenges, technological pessimism
bases its dread in an understanding that complex
social/historical/economic/political challenges cannot be instantly
solved by new technology. Furthermore, technological pessimism draws
attention to the myriad ways in which, far from being a panacea for
social/historical/economic/political issues, new technologies have a
tendency to reify and deepen these already existing problems. Rather
than acting as though new technologies spring miraculously fully formed
from the heads of benevolent Silicon Valley tinkerers (who had no
history prior to unveiling the new gadget), [technological pessimism
**fixates** on the ways in which the technologies a society produces
tend to be **reflections** of the]{.underline}
social/historical/economic/political [forces already at
work]{.underline} in those societies. [This can]{.underline} certainly
**[box technological pessimists in]{.underline}**, making it so that
[they are **unable to perceive** the ways in which the affordances of
certain technologies can **potentially challenge** those powerful
forces]{.underline}, but it maintains a starting point at which the
assumption is that new technologies create a perception of change while
simultaneously preserving the dominant relationships in a society.

Technological pessimism has much to say about the specific problems with
particular technologies, but beneath the discussion of
facial-recognition software operates an attempt to draw attention less
to the technology itself and more to the ways in which this particular
technology is a manifestation of, and will be used in order to,
strengthen the already powerful forces in a society.

Like Toto in Oz, technological pessimism looks for "the man behind the
curtain"

Technology does not "just happen." Certainly, the crowd pleasing
mythologies that tech companies like to spin often focus on
serendipitous moments that led to something suddenly appearing fully
formed in the mind of a programmer, engineer, or executive, but the
history of technology is not one in which a person goes for a walk in
the woods and discovers the laptop or the helicopter or the \[insert
whatever complex technology you like\] sitting there waiting for them.
The process by which technologies come into being is often a slow
iterative process, frequently involving large teams of people who work
on particular challenges with particular goals in mind. The stories that
we are told about technological development in popular movies and high
school textbooks sing the praises of the "eureka!" moments of lone
inventors, but when we truly consider the history of many of the most
significant technologies surrounding us the story looks a lot more like
massive government investment flowing to a wide variety of individuals
with much of this money producing relatively little of worth even as a
couple of very well-publicized successes make it all seem worthwhile.
This is not the time or place to fully recount the history of computer
machinery (or the Internet), suffice to say the public version of that
story could benefit from less focus on computer sages like Steve Jobs
and more focus on the origins of computers systems like SAGE.

Technological forces, particularly powerful and complex technological
forces, have a tendency to present themselves like a floating head
surrounded by flames, speaking in a booming voice. These technologies
appear mighty and complex, and cloak themselves behind arcane technical
language that makes them appear unknowable except to a select few. Yet,
technological pessimism, draws attention the ways in which behind the
curtain you can usually find a man (or a bunch of men) pulling the
switches.

Here technological pessimism often works to shift the attention off of
the technology itself and onto the human beings who are behind the
technology. When it comes to technology it can pretty much never be
claimed that "it had to be this way," instead it "is this way" as a
result of the decisions that were made by particular people. These are
not mystical, unknowable, reasons that can only be understood by a
sagacious high priesthood, rather they have a tendency to be banal
choices made by people who were interested in maximizing profit or
fulfilling a government contract or just taking the quickest route to
make sure that something would work. Granted, in many cases the answer
to the question "why is it like this?" turns up a distressing answer
insofar as the humans who were creating a certain thing just couldn't be
bothered to fully think through the potential implications.

[The]{.underline} "**[good news]{.underline}**" [of technology is
something that technological pessimism **refuses to accept** at face
value]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} as a result technological
pessimism [has a tendency to look for the **human faces** behind
it]{.underline}.

Manifestations of [technological pessimism reveal the anxieties of the
**particular moment** in which they occur]{.underline}

Throughout much of the twentieth century the force that generated the
greatest sustained outpouring of technological pessimism was concern
regarding nuclear weapons. The sense that humanity had achieved godlike
power without developing a similar level of responsibility fueled a
sentiment that even if humanity were not to destroy itself with these
weapons of awesome might, that the very existence of these weapons still
meant that humanity now found itself in a changed world. And that was a
world in which the survival of the species, and the survival of
civilization, operated forevermore under the shadow of the destructive
force of humanity's technological achievements. As a particular set of
technologies on which to fixate, nuclear weapons provided thinkers with
a robust set of reasons for dread. For nuclear weapons represented
technologies at the zenith of techno-scientific research, as the arms
race meant that new developments in these technologies were constantly
being pursued. To many people, the arrival of these weapons could be
seen as representing a clear dividing line between the past and the
present, and many people worried that the calamitous potential of these
weapons quickly became normalized. After all, there might have been some
military planners and defense intellectuals who argued that a nuclear
war would not truly result in the destruction of all life...but even the
optimistic predictions that one side could win a nuclear war were still
couched in predictions of total annihilation of the other. Thus, nuclear
weapons were a perfect foil for technological pessimism: a clear
technological threat, to which more and more people gradually came to be
inured. Furthermore, the fact that a nuclear war (thankfully) never
occurred did little to genuinely diminish the underlying point: that
should such an even happen the results of this technologically
heightened conflict would be catastrophic.

Granted, in the twenty-first century we don't hear quite as much about
nuclear weapons. This is not to say that the danger has ceased to exist.
Indeed, these weapons are still sitting in their silos, and the
destructive power of many of these weapons is still mighty. And yet,
they are no longer the object of technological anxieties du jour.

All of which is to say, [technological pessimism largely responds to the
prominent technologies of the day in which the **particular
manifestations** of]{.underline} technological [pessimism can be
found]{.underline}. Post-Cold War [the technologies that have occupied
the **center** of technological pessimism tend to be the vast web
of]{.underline} technologies that fall under the broad heading of
**[information technologies]{.underline}** (computers, the Internet,
smartphones, social networks, and so forth). Though much technological
pessimism also focuses its attention on the ways in which the climate
crisis has been driven by technological forces. Importantly, this is not
to suggest that no one cares about nuclear weapons anymore, nor for that
matter is it to say that the technological pessimists of the
mid-twentieth century were only concerned about nuclear weapons. It is
essential to note that the technological pessimists of the mid-twentieth
century wrote/spoke/argued extensively about the then nascent "computer
dominated society," technologically driven consumerism, and the ways
that new media technologies threatened to undermine society.
Nevertheless, in any particular historic moment, the particular
technologies about which there is the most easily detectable
manifestations of technological pessimism are going to be those about
which there is already an ambient level of social concern and social
awareness.

Technological pessimism and Luddism are not the same thing

Those who give voice to technologically pessimistic views quickly become
accustomed to having their critiques met with accusations of "Luddite."
After all, the accusation that any criticism means that one is an enemy
to any and all technology, that you really want everyone to go back to
living in caves, and that you really just want to pull out a
sledgehammer and smash the machines---are the types of popular retorts
that blunt any criticism of technology by absurdly attacking the maker
of the critiques instead of the content of those critiques. And there is
no term of derision that a techno-optimistic society likes to hurl about
more than "Luddite." To be absolutely clear, the history of the Luddites
is an important one to study, and the Luddite risings need to be placed
into a broader history of "collective bargaining by riot" (to borrow
Hobsbawm's phrase). The Luddites were not a legion of uninformed fools,
rather they were [an assembly of skilled workers]{.underline} who
[resisted machinery **not** because they were opposed to **all**
machinery but rather attacked **specific machines** in **specific
contexts**]{.underline} because they recognized that these machines were
to be used to destroy their standard of living. Or, to put it plainly,
the Luddites were workers protecting their livelihoods. There have been
many attempts throughout the years (including currently) to reclaim the
mantel of the Luddites and to restore the Luddites to a place of honor
in the history of labor---and [such efforts are]{.underline} to be
cheered.

Luddism is [an **important tendency** in the intersection between labor
history]{.underline}, [the history of technology]{.underline}, [and
broader history]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} Luddism [may well be a
**potentially powerful force** for resistance]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} Luddism [is **not**]{.underline} exactly **[the
same]{.underline}** thing [as technological pessimism]{.underline}. Some
individuals may find that their own beliefs can accommodate some mixture
of both---as they are not fundamentally opposed beliefs---but they are
not synonymous.

Granted, the problem here is largely related to the way in which the
meaning of "Luddism" has become somewhat difficult to easily define at a
point in time at which [many different groups have]{.underline} sought
to claim Luddism as their own. With a further complication lingering in
the background being those who try to carefully use the term Luddism
only to describe a particular set of ideas and beliefs held by specific
people in a specific moment. Suffice to say, at risk of
oversimplification, many manifestations of Luddism tend to be [focused
on technology as a **site for labor** and **political
struggles**]{.underline}. [Those]{.underline} who would fly the standard
of General Ludd often emphasize that the Luddites [were **not opposed to
technology**]{.underline} ([as such]{.underline}), [but they were
opposed to **certain technologies** being used in a way that all of the
benefits flowed to the bosses instead of the workers]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} an indelicate point to make, but [in many
ways]{.underline} Luddism is **[technologically
optimistic]{.underline}**, [for it often posits that the problem is not
the technology **itself** but those who are in **control** of the
technology]{.underline}. Indeed, one of the reasons why the Luddites
have been appealing to many left-wing thinkers is the way in which they
represent a legacy that asks "what if the machines were controlled by
the workers, and used to benefit their lives instead of simply enriching
the factory owners?" [Even as technological pessimism pays attention to
economic conditions]{.underline}, [and recognizes the ways in which it
matters who is in control of the machinery]{.underline}, [technological
pessimism takes an attitude wherein sometimes the problem **really is
the machinery**]{.underline}. For technological pessimism, [who runs the
machines]{.underline} (and to what end) [matters]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} there are also cases where there are [certain
technologies]{.underline} that [are themselves the problem
**regardless** of who is using them]{.underline}. Of course, there are
certain strands of Luddism that do advance exactly this argument
(Winner's "epistemological Luddism" seems to fit nicely into such a
category), but not all of them.

Luddism and technological pessimism can peacefully coexist in a single
mind and a single heart, but in discussions over what to do with certain
technologies there is a not insignificant difference between saying "the
workers need to run it" and saying "we need to dismantle it completely."

For the most part, technological pessimism (and technological
pessimists) would rather be called something else

Generally speaking, people don't like to be accused of being
pessimistic. There is a cultural bias (at least in the US) in favor of
positivity, thinking hopefully, and believing that tomorrow will be
better than today. We are told to smile more, not to frown more. Airport
bookshelves are filled with bestsellers encouraging people to think how
lucky they are to be alive today, with works pushing people to live
their best lives, and jeremiads that success can be yours if you are
just willing to master these seven habits! Such optimism is not only the
domain of cloying books and social media posts that earn eye-rolls from
the world-weary. Narratives that frame history as a story of slow
(fragile) progression, council hope and warn against despair. While
pessimism is framed as the great foe of activist movements and struggles
insofar as it is thought that a pessimistic attitude leads to apathy and
lethargy. Or, to put it bluntly, pessimists make bad party guests, they
make bad dates, and they tend to make people feel bad by suggesting that
things aren't going to work out for the best. We are smart enough to
scoff at the excessive optimism of the Panglosses of the world, but most
of us would still rather share a drink with Pangloss than with someone
who holds the complete opposite views.

In other words, technological pessimism (and [technological
pessimists]{.underline}) [tend **not to identify**]{.underline}
themselves as technological pessimists or [what they are engaging in
as]{.underline} technological **[pessimism]{.underline}**. For the mere
invocation of "pessimism" is often enough to cause other people to stop
listening, and because those who mention pessimism quickly tire of the
Gramscian retort that pessimism of the intellect is all well and fine
just so long as they remember to maintain optimism of the will. Perhaps
this is why so [many]{.underline} technological pessimists [prefer to
use the more anodyne descriptor of]{.underline}
"**[critic]{.underline}**," for that is [an umbrella term that
can]{.underline} so [comfortably include different
viewpoints]{.underline} without resulting in immediate pigeon holing.
The terms we use to define ourselves often become the terms that others
use to box us in, and technological pessimists are right to worry that
the "pessimist" label draws attention to their negative critiques while
ignoring the positive elements of their views. You can be pessimistic
about technology, but optimistic about social movements. You can be
pessimistic about consumer gadgets, but be optimistic about cultures of
repair and reuse. And you can be pessimistic about "authoritarian
technologies," while still being optimistic about "democratic
technologies."

As it is not a clearly defined ideology (you can't really point to a
manifesto for this), technological pessimism is a label that many
individuals remain hesitant to genuinely embrace. This is not to
castigate or ridicule individuals who would rather not call themselves,
or what they do, technological pessimism---rather it is to note the
simple fact that in cultures where techno-optimism is a belief system
that permeates across the public and political spectrum, it isn't really
a surprise that people would prefer not to call themselves technological
pessimists.

While technological pessimism is thoroughly political, it does not
easily fit into "left" or "right"

Placing technological pessimism into the quadrant map of political
beliefs is not an easy task. As a viewpoint that tends to be skeptical
of the idea of progress, it might seem that technological pessimism is a
right-wing set of beliefs. As a viewpoint that tends to focus on the way
in which technological systems retrench already existing power
relations, it might seem that technological pessimism is a left-wing set
of beliefs. That technological pessimism worries about the way that
technology has despoiled the planet---exacerbating climate change, and
with the environmental cost being born most heavily by those who do not
get to enjoy the benefits of these technologies, it might seem that
technological pessimism is a left-wing set of beliefs. To the extent
that this same level of environmental concern (matched as it often is
with a certain pining for an idealized past of fewer machines) can
devolve into a sort of romanticism, it might seem that technological
pessimism leans to the right. And that technological pessimism dares to
suggest that all is not well in the world, makes it quite clear that it
does not belong to the political center.

Technology is a site of political contestation. And being the ideology
that claims technology is much more complex than being the ideology that
claims social media. At the present moment forces on the political left
and forces on the political right are united in turning a distrustful
gaze towards certain tech platforms out of Silicon Valley---but both
political wings remain committed to being the side that can best steward
technology. It is hard to easily fit technological pessimism into the
left or into the right, but techno-optimism is a tendency that is on
full display on the left, right, and in the center. As the dominant
attitude towards technology, techno-optimism is a stance that left,
right, and center all want to claim. After all, techno-optimism is what
gives regular people the promise that they will be able to partake in
the pleasure and privileges of technological advancement, and political
forces on the left, right, and center all want to be the bestowers of
those benefits. Couched in techno-optimism: the left puts forth a vision
in which technological progress can be used to more equitably distribute
power and the plenty created by technological systems; the right puts
forth a vision in which technological progress can be used to maintain
the power and authority of the dominant power groups (who it views as
the only ones who can truly command technology), and the center holds
the view that steady technological advancement is the best way of
maintaining the delicate balance where the ship keeps sailing (without
improving conditions in steerage). Technological pessimism does not fit
in particularly easy here.

There is nothing apolitical about technological pessimism, but in a
world in which most politics are infused with techno-optimism, it is
impossible to easily shoehorn technological pessimism into one side of
the political perspective. It may well be that the core focus on a
critique of power (and the desire to center human beings) pushes
technological pessimism towards the left, but goodness knows the last
thing that many leftists want to be accused of is being pessimistic
about technology.

[There is a danger that technological pessimism **can easily tilt** into
**technological determinism**]{.underline}

Simply defined, technological determinism is [the belief
that]{.underline} "**[technology drives history]{.underline}**." This is
an idea that [is not the property of **any single group** or
**ideology**]{.underline}. Indeed, [this sort of attitude]{.underline}
towards technology is one that [can be **widely detected** amongst a
**variety of groups** in the world]{.underline} today as well as in the
past. Granted, one often stumbles across a sort of crass technological
determinism whenever one encounters headlines that say that a certain
technology "will" do something in the next five years, that a certain
technology "is" inevitable, or when the market juicing comments of a CEO
regarding their companies next big product are echoed uncritically.
Nevertheless, [the basic idea of technological determinism is that
technology is the **autonomous conductor** and it is driving this train
speedily down iron tracks that are going in **one very particular
direction**]{.underline}. Technological optimists have a tendency to
believe that those tracks are going to take the passengers sitting in
the cabin cars to a utopia of technological plenty, while [technological
pessimists have a tendency to believe that those tracks are going
to]{.underline} take the passengers to [either a **high-tech
dystopia**]{.underline} of mass-produced distractions that hide
authoritarian surveillance [or a **desolate wasteland**]{.underline}.

Technological pessimism may seek to maintain [a **more critical
attitude** towards technology]{.underline}, basing much of its critique
in a barbed response to the idea that technological forces are
inevitably going to lead to paradise...but in the process technological
pessimism [can **fall victim** to the **flipside** of this same sort of
idea of inevitability]{.underline}. With the main difference being that
where technological optimists think that the high-tech paradise is
inevitable, [technological pessimists think that the wasteland is
**inevitable**]{.underline}.

Vitally, this is not to claim that all technological pessimism (or all
technological optimism) falls victim to technological determinism, but
this is a major risk. [Technological pessimism often draws attention to
the **complexity** and **contingency** that can be found in the history
of technology]{.underline}; **[however]{.underline}**, [sometimes this
flexibility **vanishes** in order to suggest that certain technologies
have made certain results **inevitable**]{.underline}. Granted, [a major
feature of much technological pessimism is to **draw attention** to the
ways in which many technological systems have been constructed to be
**deterministic**]{.underline}. [The **retort** could take the form
of]{.underline} saying that "[it **isn't**]{.underline} technological
[**determinism** to highlight the ways in which certain technologies
have been designed to remake society in their own images]{.underline}."
And here technological pessimists could point to the ways in which a
world in which nuclear weapons exists is one in which massive
technical/political/economic/bureaucratic systems have been developed,
and must be maintained, in order to oversee this technological order.
Or, on a less apocalyptic note, the ways in which mass computerization
eventually reaches a point at which participating in society requires
individuals to make use of these technological systems (whether they
like it or not). When a society reaches a point that it becomes a sign
of privilege to opt out of a particular technology, it is usually a
fairly decent sign of how that technology is playing a determining role
in society. Thus, [technological pessimism **responds** to charges of
technological determinism by drawing attention to the ways in which
technologies]{.underline}, as they grow in power, [come to **remake
societies** in their own technological image]{.underline}.

Noting [the ways in which]{.underline} technologies, and large
[technological systems can themselves be deterministic is]{.underline}
doubtless an important point, and [a **thorny matter**]{.underline} with
which to contend. And [while much technological pessimism **attempts**
to avoid the pitfalls of **simplistic technological
determinism**]{.underline}, [moments of frustration **can easily give
rise** to treating as **inevitable** that which has not been carved into
steel]{.underline}.

[Technology is **not itself the conductor**]{.underline}, [different
humans in the engine car could **still switch the tracks**]{.underline},
[or agitated passengers could **still pull the emergency
brake**]{.underline}, [and none can say with complete certainty if that
haze in the distance is **steam from the baths** or **smoke from the
ruins**]{.underline}.

become **a**]{.mark} **widely expressed [trope]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The result is that Critical IR theorists now engage in increasingly
virulent disagreements over the political and ethical implications of
disciplinarity itself. In perpetual abeyance, [[claimants to Critical
IR]{.mark} [become **hostages** to]{.mark} **a continuous
[risk]{.mark}** [of being exposed as **insufficiently pure**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the ([[modernist, racist, colonial]{.mark},
patriarchal, heteronormative, positivist, capitalist]{.underline})
[[traces]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'the major literature/discipline'. At
the same time, Critical IR scholars who advocate for a disciplinary exit
in search of 'more Critical' inter-disciplines have found themselves
wrestling with the charge of pre-judgement: [Since they appear to know
what 'Being Critical' will look like]{.underline} after
de-disciplinarisation, [[critique takes]{.mark} the [form of **testing**
whether]{.mark} other [scholars meet]{.mark} these **[pre-given
criteria]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Holden, 2006; **[[Howell and
Richter-Montpetit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 2020).

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} stream in contemporary IR scholarship
[**[ignores]{.mark}** the [manners in which]{.mark}]{.underline} minor
[[theories, **far from tending to**]{.mark}**wards
[alliances]{.mark}**[, are]{.mark} often [set to
**contradictory**]{.mark} **political and ethical [purposes]{.mark}**.
And that **the [visions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[world]{.mark}
politics** created [by scholars **'moving beyond'**]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}** [can be **just as problematic**]{.mark} as
visions already settled within the discipline. **[Contemporary]{.mark}
political and social [movements]{.mark}** [borrow]{.mark} **intellectual
[resources]{.mark}** from various]{.underline} (once or still) [minor
theoretical traditions in IR [to think against **a 'Globalist'**]{.mark}
**world [order]{.mark}**, [incorporating]{.mark}]{.underline} the
Gramscian position that 'politics is downstream from culture', [the
ideal of a **transgressive emancipatory identity**, and the **critique
of neo-colonialism**]{.underline} (Love, 2017; Nagle 2017). The
philosopher Alain De Benoist wrote his manifesto for the New Right in
the year 2000 with the aim of challenging the oppressive implications of
major international theories, especially Liberalism, borrowing widely
from resources of minor intellectual critique (de Benoist and
Champetier, 1999). [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} theory
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} marginal in disciplinary IR, but [[influential
amongst **populist politicians**]{.underline}]{.mark} like Putin, Trump,
Orban, Salvini and Le Pen, [as well as online communities of **[Race
Realists]{.mark}**, [**western chauvinists**, and **white**
]{.mark}**nationalists**. It proposes that Liberalism **destroys the
autonomy** of ethnicities and cultures, and that the history of the west
has been one of ongoing **cultural** as well as **political
colonialism**]{.underline}. De Benoist's argument is that the project of
decolonisation is incomplete, and continues through international aid
and UN-led Liberal paternalism.

[The answer proposed by the **New Right** is to restore a **truly
independent status** to diverse cultures and indigenous world-views in
International Relations, and suggest that people belonging to these
'birth-cultures' must actively work towards their **national** and
**cognitive emancipation** from all the baggage of Liberal
modernity]{.underline}, if necessary, [through **violently closing
borders**]{.underline}. The New Right claims its intellectual
marginality vis-à-vis Liberalism or Globalism (understood as the
ideological representative of modernism in international thought) is a
marker of its virtue. The New Right is not, however, widely viewed as a
'Critical ally' of Decolonial IR theory.

A claim to minor theoretical status is also visible amongst reactionary
theorists of gender, including online groups of men's rights activists,
western chauvinist militias like the Proud Boys, or traditionalist
'family values' movements (Nagle, 2017). These groups develop an
operative concept of the radical intellectual margins as central to
their understandings of critique, and of the emancipatory relationship
which their critique has to hegemonic theoretical frameworks that they
perceive as oppressing them: Liberalism or 'Cultural Marxism' (Nagle,
2017). These actors see their critiques of what they term 'gender
ideology' as part of a necessary escape from the straightjacket of
modernist categories, currently hegemonic in contemporary academia. In
other words, the belief that transgressive or marginal theory is
emancipatory has diverse advocates, whose antimodernism or
anti-hegemonism comes with divergent attitudes to gender, race, culture,
economics, social, political and international organisation.

The sociological implications of this point were anticipated, but not
fully developed, by Katz (1996: 488), who noted that:

['**[talk]{.mark} of exclusion** [can lead to]{.mark} an **unsavory
hierarchy of [marginalization]{.mark}** -- a kind of **[competitive
victimology]{.mark}** -- [and]{.mark} even to the cul-de-sac of an
**[essentialist identity politics]{.mark}**. Notions of [exclusion
are]{.mark}]{.underline} all about, one might even say
[**[tautologically]{.mark}** [about, position]{.mark}, and if we are not
careful [they]{.mark} can [lead to **relativist**]{.mark} [**accounts**
that offer **little**]{.mark} **of practical [value]{.mark}**. And they
can be **disingenuous** -- proclamations of exclusion by scholars who
are **quite included**]{.underline}'.

The historical moment facing critique calls us to recognise that minor
[[theories infer **no allied ethics**]{.mark} **or politics**. [There is
**no cohesive**]{.mark} **and abiding** [sovereign]{.mark} '**logic of
[modernity]{.mark}**' [that forms the **superstructure** of]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**, and gives **assurance** that the
postdisciplinary avant-guard will **share an understanding of
virtue**]{.underline}. The romanticism characteristic of self-describing
Critical intellectual cultures that arose in IR in the immediate
Post-Cold War context must now be reconsidered. [Many of **[the
same]{.mark} intellectual [tools]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} now being
**effectively [mobilised by]{.mark} reactionaries**, [**racists** and
**gender absolutists**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Contemporary
reactionaries]{.underline} have read their Deleuze, their Gramsci, their
Derrida and Foucault (see Land, 2012), and they [are **cognisant** of
the discursive logic and rhetorical power of]{.underline}, for example,
[concepts of **exclusion**, **identity**, **precarity**,
**marginality**, **hegemony**, the **avant-guard**, **victimhood** and
**indigeneity**]{.underline} (see Michelsen and De Orellana, 2019).

[The challenge facing scholars in IR who seek to write in the service of
vulnerable groups]{.underline}, like migrants lacking a safe home state,
those who do not fit with heteronormative gender roles, or the victims
of racism, [is that their reactionary theoretical interlocutors have
**recognised the power** in claiming to be uniquely reflexive critics,
**intellectually marginal** vis-à-vis dominant theoretical assumptions
about IR]{.underline}. The category [['Critical IR' provides]{.mark}
**[no tools]{.mark}** by which [to **counter**]{.mark} these
[relativistic arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, [the
[belief]{.mark} that ['Being Critical' **requires**]{.mark}]{.underline}
a minoritarian [[**exit** from]{.mark} **disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} be a **[distract]{.mark}ion** [from]{.mark} developing
**methodologically and epistemologically [rigorous critiques]{.mark}**,
that can be communicated as such. Faith in the emancipatory intellectual
margins brings]{.underline} to mind Latour's (2004: 225) [worry that
self-describing ['Critical' scholars]{.mark} today [are]{.mark} like
'**those [mechanical]{.mark} toys** that **endlessly [make the same
gesture]{.mark}** when everything else has changed around
them']{.underline}.

**Chandler, 17**---Department of Politics & International Relations,
University of Westminster (David, "The Pragmatic Critique,"
*Peacebuilding: The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1997-2017*, Chapter 2, pp
21--42, SpringerLink, dml)

At the core of the 'pragmatist' and 'political' critiques of 'liberal'
peacebuilding was a critique of liberal universalist aspirations rather
than a critique of the new international hierarchies and divisions based
on the institutionalisation of the divide between 'liberal'
peacebuilders and 'non-liberal' Others. The [critique reflected the
**ease** with which]{.underline} '**[liberalism]{.underline}**' [had
become a]{.underline} '**[field of adversity]{.underline}**', through
[which]{.underline} both policy reformers and radical critics could both
stake out their positions. The construction of a liberal 'field of
adversity' [had **little relation to policy realities**]{.underline}.
This was reflected in the fact that, [while there was a consensus on the
view that Western policies were **problematic** in that they were
**too**]{.underline} '**[liberal]{.underline}**', [there was **much less
attention** to how]{.underline} the [problems]{.underline} of the
postcolonial world [might have been **alternatively
addressed**]{.underline}. Here, as discussed below, the discursive
critique of liberal peacebuilding unfortunately had very little to offer
and merely established the conceptual basis for today's pragmatic
consensus.

BEYOND THE CRITIQUE OF THE LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING?

It would appear that [the ostensibly more radical]{.underline} or
'political' [critics]{.underline}, those [who drew out the problematic
nature of power relations]{.underline}, [in fact]{.underline}, [had
**very little to offer** as a critical alternative to]{.underline} the
[policies of intervention]{.underline} and peacebuilding, [other than a
**scaling back** of the possibilities of social change]{.underline}. The
leading 'political' critics of liberal peacebuilding, like Mark Duffield
and Michael Pugh -- working through [**critical theoretical frameworks**
which problematised **power relations** and highlighted the importance
of **difference**]{.underline} -- [suggested that the difference between
the liberal West and the non-liberal Other **could not be bridged
through**]{.underline} Western **[policymaking]{.underline}**. For Pugh,
as we have seen above, [taking critical theory to its logical
conclusion]{.underline}, [**capitalist rationality** was **itself** to
be condemned for its **universalising** and **destabilising
impulses**]{.underline}. Similarly, for Duffield, [it seemed that the
problem of hegemonic relations of power and knowledge **could not be
overcome**]{.underline}, [making **any** projection of the ideals of
development or democracy **potentially oppressive**]{.underline} (2007,
pp. 215--34). Oliver Richmond systematised these critiques, bringing
them within the radical pragmatist perspective, highlighting the
problems of the disciplinary forms of knowledge of liberal peacebuilding
approaches and suggesting that while it may be possible to go beyond
them through the use of post-positivist and ethnographic approaches --
enabling external interveners to have a greater access to the knowledge
of 'everyday life' in non-liberal societies being intervened in -- [any
attempt to **know**]{.underline}, [rather than merely to
express]{.underline} '**[empathy]{.underline}**', [was open to
**hegemonic abuse**]{.underline} (see 2008a, p. 157).

[Without a **political agent** of emancipatory social
change]{.underline}, the [radical]{.underline} 'political'
[critiques]{.underline} of liberal peacebuilding, which drew upon the
modernist perspectives of critical Marxist or Foucauldian theory,
**[could not go beyond the bind which they had set
themselves]{.underline}**, [of **overcoming hegemonic frameworks** of
knowledge and power]{.underline}. In fact, it could be argued that
[these critical approaches]{.underline}, [lacking the **basis** of a
political subject to **give content** to critical
theorising]{.underline}, [ultimately took an **uncritical approach** to
power]{.underline}. [Power was **assumed** rather than
**theorised**]{.underline}, [making the limits to power
appear]{.underline} merely as **[external]{.underline}** to it. [It was
**assumed** that there was an attempt to transform the world in
**liberal terms** and that the **failure** to do so could therefore be
used to argue that liberal forms of knowledge were
**inadequate**]{.underline} ones. [The critique was amenable to
being]{.underline} '**[co-opted]{.underline}**' [into pragmatist
frameworks and became one not essentially of **power** or of
**intervention** per se but of]{.underline} the **[limited
knowledge]{.underline}** of liberal interveners. [The alternative was
not that of **emancipatory social transformation** but of the
**speculative** and **passive search** for **different**]{.underline},
**[non-liberal]{.underline}**, **[forms of knowledge]{.underline}** or
of knowing. This came across clearly in the conclusions reached by
Duffield, Richmond and others, and highlighted the lack of a critical
alternative embedded in these approaches.

The more ostensibly conservative pragmatic critics of peacebuilding,
drawn largely to the policymaking sphere, had much clearer political
aims in their critique of liberal universalism. This was manifest in
their focus on institutional reform, understood as a way of reconciling
non-liberal states and societies both to the market and to democratic
forms. This, like the transitology discourse before it, was a radical
critique of classical liberal assumptions. In their advocacy of these
frameworks, discursively framed as critiques of liberal peacebuilding,
they had a clear point of reference. Although, as highlighted above,
this point of reference was largely a fictional one: a constructed
narrative of post-Cold War intervention, which enabled them to ground
the scaling back of policy expectations against a framework of allegedly
unrealistic or 'hubristic' liberal aspirations.

This critique of 'liberalism' became more an apologia for
interventionist policymaking, rather than a critique, the more
policymakers were condemned for being 'liberal'. Institutionalist
approaches, which informed the interventionist frameworks of
international institutions and donors in the 1990s and 2000s, were
explicit in their denunciation of the universalist assumptions of
classical liberalism. This critique of liberalism was however an
indirect one, inevitably so, as the institutionalist critique developed
at the height of the Cold War (see, for example, Leys, 1996). This is
why, while the classical concepts of the liberal rights framework
remained -- 'sovereignty', 'democracy', 'rule of law', 'civil society'
-- they were given a new content, transforming the universal discourse
of the autonomous liberal rights-holder from that of the subject of
rights to the object of regulation (see Chandler, 2010). This new
content was unfortunately of little interest to the more radical
'political' critics of liberal peacebuilding. But, in understanding the
content of institutionalist approaches, it is possible to tie together
the superficial nature of external engagement with the fact that it had
a non-liberal content rather than one that was too liberal.

The [institutionalist discourse]{.underline} of intervention and
regulation [was **not** one of **liberal universalism**]{.underline} and
transformation [but one of **restricted possibilities**]{.underline},
[where democracy and development were **hollowed out** and]{.underline},
[rather than **embodying**]{.underline} the possibilities of [the
autonomous human subject]{.underline}, [become mechanisms of **control**
and **ordering**]{.underline}. Institutionalisation reduced law to an
administrative code, politics to technocratic decision-making,
democratic and civil rights to those of the supplicant rather than the
citizen, replacing the citizenry with civil society, and the promise of
capitalist modernity with pro-poor poverty reduction (see further
Chandler, 2006a, 2010; Foucault, 2008; Hay, 2007; Williams, 2000;
Krastev, 2004). [Critical conceptualising of this **inversion** of basic
liberal assumptions and ontologies as]{.underline}
'**[liberalism]{.underline}**' [made the word **meaningless** at the
same time as claiming to stake **everything** on the assumed meaning and
stakes involved]{.underline} in the critique of 'liberal' peacebuilding.

CONCLUSION

The end of the experiment of international peacebuilding has been
rationalised and accepted on the pragmatist basis that Western
peacebuilding interventions were too 'liberal'. The fact that
'liberalism' was to blame is allegedly revealed in the lack of success
on the ground: in the failure to achieve liberal outcomes. For the
pragmatist critics, the sources of this failure are held to be located
in the non-liberal nature of the societies intervened upon. In the
dominant policy framing of interventionist agendas, this failing is
because of the lack of capacity of domestic societies and political
elites; for more radical readings, the problematic impact of external
policymaking is often re-read as the resistance of indigenous ways of
life and knowledges, which should instead be understood and empathised
with.

The [critique of]{.underline} 1990s and 2000s **[policies]{.underline}**
of peacebuilding [for their **liberalism** suggests that the self-image
of the West was being projected where it **could not take
hold**]{.underline}. As we have seen, [this critique **easily
flattered** the self-understanding of liberal interveners]{.underline}
that if they were incapable of transforming the post-conflict societies
[and]{.underline} failing states, that they were engaged with, it was
merely because they could not easily be anything other than liberal and
that the societies being intervened in were not ready for liberal
frameworks of governance. These critiques [have thereby **cohered** and
**naturalised** the reproduction of the **ideological binary** of the
civilisational divide between]{.underline} '[the **West** and the
**Rest**]{.underline}', which was seen to be confirmed the more
interventionist approaches appeared to have little impact and to have to
be scaled back.

[There are]{.underline} obviously [a **number of problems** with the
critical pragmatic consensus of the failure of]{.underline} '[liberal
peacebuilding]{.underline}'. [These stem not merely from the fact that
the]{.underline} interventionist [policies being critiqued were **far**
from]{.underline} '**[liberal]{.underline}**'. [Of **greater concern**
is the way that the term]{.underline} '**[liberal]{.underline}**'
[became an **easy** and **unproblematic assertion** of critical
intent]{.underline}. [The **critique**]{.underline} of liberal
peacebuilding -- [and its ability to encompass both **policy advocates**
and **radical critics**]{.underline} of intervention -- [revealed much
more about the **problematic state** of radical and liberal thought than
it did about]{.underline} the [**policies** and
**practices**]{.underline} of intervention and peacebuilding. [The
ostensible framework of **liberal**]{.underline} peacebuilding -- of the
transformative dynamic **[ontology]{.underline}** of [the **universal
rational subject**]{.underline} -- [had **already long since
been**]{.underline} critiqued and [**displaced** by the framework of
**governance** and **regulatory power**]{.underline}. It was peculiar,
in these circumstances, that the dominant policy discussion and the
radical discursive framing of post-Cold War peacebuilding should
therefore have taken this form.

#### There is [no genuine alternative]{.underline} to [some form]{.underline} of liberalism that doesn't empower [global authoritarian violence]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} "**[crisis in confidence]{.underline}** and
credibility" (Cooper 2007: 605) [of liberal peace]{.underline} has been
a subject of much debate in International Relations. It [has also led to
the question of]{.underline} genuine and **[viable
alternatives]{.underline}** to liberal peace. Critics of
[these]{.underline} alternatives, however, suggest that they
[represent]{.underline} "[espousing **variations** within]{.underline}"
(Paris 2010) or [a]{.underline} "[problem-solving
framework]{.underline}" [for liberal peace]{.underline}
(Nadarajah/Rampton 2015) [rather than **genuine
alternatives**]{.underline}. This essay argues that [the only
**genuine** alternative to liberal peace is **illiberal
peace**]{.underline}, [which is **not viable**]{.underline}. The rising
illiberal challenge to liberal peace is, however, not included in the
academic debate about the extent of the crisis of liberal peace and its
viability and efficacy. Rather, the debate is centred around criticism
of the core assumptions of liberal peace and whether emancipatory
strategies present genuine alternatives or are still situated within a
liberal framework and thus based on the same problematic assumptions
(Nadarajah/Rampton 2017; Cooper, Turner, and Pugh 2011).

This essay argues that [even though the criticism of liberal peace
is]{.underline}, [in **certain cases**]{.underline},
**[valid]{.underline}**, [the lack of engagement with the **rising
authoritarian challenge** to liberal peace is a]{.underline} blind spot
\[**[gap]{.underline}**\] [in the]{.underline} academic
**[debate]{.underline}** surrounding liberal peace. Lewis, Heathershaw
and Megoran (2018) argue that we see the rise of authoritarian practices
and illiberal forms of conflict management characterizing state
responses to internal conflict in places like Russia, Sri Lanka, China,
Ethiopia, Rwanda and Turkey. Several studies in recent years have paid
attention to these tendencies in domestic conflict settlements (Smith
2014; Lewis 2010; Russell 2014; Baglione 2008; Soares de Oliveira 2011).

This essay examines authoritarian trends in peacebuilding by using the
example of the Syrian crisis. It argues that domestic tendencies towards
a "victory peace" are being fostered by illiberal tendencies in the
international sphere. Duncombe and Dunne (2018) suggest that the failure
of the international community to intervene in the complex humanitarian
emergency in Syria signifies the fragility of the liberal world order.
Since the annexation of the Crimea, Russia has openly turned its back
against the western liberal norms of international politics. In China,
statism, paired with corruption, a lack of democracy and human rights
abuses, enables its economic model to outdo the West and the rest.
Smaller illiberal powers like Iran keep destabilizing their regions.
Furthermore, illiberal populist forces are rising in the heart of the
West. If the United States, a key international actor, is not expressing
firm commitment to liberal values either in practice, or in rhetoric,
anymore, the leadership of the liberal international order is
fundamentally challenged. Thus, we might not only be witnessing a rise
in illiberal modes of domestic conflict management, but also in
illiberal internationalism. This is not how history was supposed to end
(Fukuyama 1989). The Syrian crisis could be the final signpost that the
crisis of liberal peacekeeping might after all have shifted from one of
"perceived effectiveness" towards one of "empirical extensiveness and
influence" (Cooper 2007).

With this autocratic revival, [tackling the **great problems of the 21st
century** will require **more**]{.underline}, **[not
less]{.underline}**, [liberal internationalism]{.underline}. This leads
to the conclusion that [we might be well-advised in]{.underline}
'**[saving]{.underline}**' [liberal peace by **engaging** with its
problem-solving frameworks to **prevent** genuine illiberal alternatives
from becoming **dominant**]{.underline}. This is challenging, especially
in the light of rising authoritarianism in the West itself, as the
separation between 'liberal' and 'non-liberal' worlds inherent in
liberal peacebuilding becomes more blurred (Nadarajah/Rampton 2017). [As
the **debate** on possible alternatives to liberal peace is **centred**
about]{.underline} the question of solving [its **many problems** and
**failures**]{.underline}, and making peace sustainable, fair and
holistic, [the only genuine alternative]{.underline} to liberal peace,
namely [illiberal peace]{.underline}, [is **mainly left out** of the
discussion]{.underline}. This essay tries to bring it back in and argues
that [a commitment to liberal peace]{.underline}, [how **imperfect** it
may be]{.underline}, [might be the **only way** to prevent illiberal
peace from becoming **more dominant**]{.underline}.

This essay will first discuss the academic debate on liberal peace and
its crisis. Then it will analyse proposed 'alternatives'. Following the
analysis, it will argue that although the literature describes the
crisis as one of confidence rather than that of empirical evidence, we
might be observing the emergence of a crisis of liberal peace in the
form of authoritarian peace. This claim is further explored through the
example of the Syrian crisis.

The Trajectory of Liberal Peace

With the end of the Cold War, the United States used the window of
opportunity that the breakdown of the Soviet Union presented to adopt a
policy of liberal hegemony. Liberal internationalism, however, is not a
project that started in 1989; the historical trajectory of liberal peace
can be traced back all the way to Kant, Locke or Mill who laid the
philosophical foundation of liberalism. Throughout the colonial age, the
liberal idea was represented in the 'mission civilatrice' (Paris 2002).
Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, it morphed into New Deal
liberalism to restore the prosperity of the United States to then
rebuild the liberal order after World War II. It was challenged again by
the rise of nuclear power and the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s. In
short, the history of liberal internationalism is one of struggle and
counter-struggle. After 1989, however, liberalism had the chance to
flourish, as the international order shifted from a bipolar to a
unipolar world order under American hegemony.

Liberal peace, though a broad umbrella, can be understood as "the
dominant form of peacemaking and peacebuilding favored by leading
states, international organizations and international financial
institutions" (MacGinty 2010: 391). The rationale behind this form of
engagement is based on the 'democratic' or 'liberal peace thesis', which
suggests that [liberal states **do not go to war** against each
other]{.underline}. Exporting liberal forms of state-building is
therefore seen as peace-promoting activity (MacGinty 2010: 394). The
conviction that [liberalism is **intrinsically
peace-promoting**]{.underline} has led to the increase in
internationally sponsored peace interventions in the decades since the
end of the Cold War, for example, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan or
Sierra Leone. As western developmental, humanitarian and peacebuilding
engagement in the global South has increased, liberal peace has become
the dominant peacebuilding paradigm.

[Though there is no agreed upon definition of liberalism]{.underline},
[it is possible to identify **central liberal values**]{.underline}
which have served to justify peace interventions throughout the last two
decades [such as]{.underline} "[the primacy of the
**individual**]{.underline}, [the belief in the **reformability** of
individuals and institutions]{.underline}, [**pluralism** and
**toleration**]{.underline}, [the **rule of law**]{.underline}, [and the
**protection of property**]{.underline}" (MacGinty 2010: 393). In the
contemporary world, liberalism can be summarized as "a formal and
informal commitment to principles and practices of individual rights and
responsibility in the context of equality of opportunity, the rule of
law, freedom of expression and association, a mainly market economy and
governments chosen in multi-party free elections" (Herring 2008: 48).
[The belief in]{.underline} the superiority of **[liberal
values]{.underline}**, [combined with]{.underline} the **[democratic
peace]{.underline}** thesis, [has encouraged]{.underline} governments
and international organizations to display [**confidence** in the
ability of liberalism to offer **salvation** against
**war**]{.underline}, **[poverty]{.underline}**, [**disease**
and]{.underline} '**[terrorism]{.underline}**' (MacGinty 2010: 394).
Nonetheless, this confidence has been questioned in recent years.

The Crisis of Liberal Peace

Proponents of liberal peace interventions, though not a homogenous bloc,
argue that the core elements of liberal peace, security and
stabilization, reinforcing states, democratic governance, and
marketization, act to emancipate people (MacGinty 2010: 395).
[Critics]{.underline}, however, [argue that]{.underline} liberal peace
is doing little for the emancipation of the general public. Rather,
[liberal rhetoric]{.underline} seen as justifying the western-led
peacebuilding project which [is]{.underline}, in reality, [an
articulation of a new form of **imperialism** to reinforce Western
hegemony]{.underline} through the promotion of neoliberal capitalist
development (Chandler 2010; Cooper et al. 2011; Duffield 2011; Dillon
2000; Barkawi 1999; Pugh 2005).

According to critics, the intensification of liberal interventionism
after the end of the Cold War has led to the creation of a problematic
'power/knowledge nexus', "constituted by a network of aid donor and
recipient states, UN agencies, international financial institutions,
NGOs, and myriad academic and policy research centres, that aligns
diverse interests, calculations, and practices with an ethical, if not
moral, problem-solving mission to end the various conflagrations in the
borderlands and interstices of a now explicitly globalising liberal
order" (Nadarajah/Rampton 2015: 52). [This power/knowledge nexus is
thought to be **problematic** as it reflects the practical and
ideological interests of the global north]{.underline}. [The central
irony within liberal peace]{.underline}, which is [pointed out by its
critics]{.underline}, [is that it often engages in **illiberal means**
to promote liberal values]{.underline}. [It is further criticized for
its alleged **ethnocentrism**]{.underline} -- the promotion of western
values as universal liberal goals. [Under critique is also the belief in
the liberating abilities of the **free market**]{.underline} (Cooper et
al. 2011). MacGinty (2010: 394) argues that liberal peace has become
"neoliberal peace and engages in 'aggressive social engineering',
whereby the private sector is privileged over notions of the common
good, often with profound human consequences".

Since the Global War on Terror and interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq
and elsewhere, [some argue that a crisis of liberal peace has
emerged]{.underline}. These interventions have exposed the "violent,
coercive, and militarised character of a cosmetically pacific liberal
order", and several problems, including "exacerbated conflict dynamics,
developmental failure, and localized and transnational resistances" have
become apparent (Nadarajah/Rampton 2015: 52). Cooper (2007), however,
emphasizes that [any crisis of liberal peace is one of]{.underline}
"[**confidence** and **perceived effectiveness** rather than one of
**empirical extensiveness**]{.underline}" (Cooper 2007: 605).

While there is a crisis concerning what liberal peace can and cannot
achieve, the principal focus remains on liberal peace as an instrument
of hegemony. In contrast, this essay argues that an empirical crisis of
liberal peace is emerging, which has been largely ignored in the
academic debate surrounding liberal peace.

Hybrid Peace -- a "Problem Solving Tool"?

The [intensified critique]{.underline} of liberal peace [has led to the
emergence of varied]{.underline} '**[alternatives]{.underline}**' for
peace promotion including hybrid, everyday, post-liberal, social
democratic, republican and communitarian peace (e.g. Richmond 2011;
MacGinty 2010; Mitchell 2010; Roberts 2011; Barnett 2006). [The most
popular]{.underline} of these alternatives is the 'hybrid peace'
concept. It [identifies]{.underline} the [opportunity for a
**post-liberal**]{.underline}, [**truly emancipatory form**
of]{.underline} peacebuilding in the 'hybridity' between liberal
international and **[local everyday agency]{.underline}**. This view
contends that the statist, territorial logic of liberal peacebuilding
can be overcome by interconnected hybrid formations of peacebuilding.
Scholars researching hybridity acknowledge that peace is not a universal
concept. Rather, they are interested in the space that emerges at sites
of peacebuilding interventions when the goals, norms and practices of
international actors collide with local, everyday activities, needs,
interests and experiences. Within this space, an interface with a unique
range of possible practices, responses and agencies forms. Studying this
interface opens up political space between the 'local' and the
'international' and allows for attention to be paid to the 'hybridity'
between them (Richmond 2012: 1). In general, literature on hybrid peace
tries to emphasize the importance of local agency in shaping
peacebuilding outcomes. [The problems inherent in liberal
peace]{.underline}, as described above, [are sought to be overcome by
the **shift of focus**]{.underline} towards hybridity.

In many ways, however, [this approach is more a]{.underline} "**[problem
solving tool]{.underline}**" [for liberal peace than a **genuine
alternative**]{.underline}. It is seen as an "encompassment and folding
into global liberal order of cultural, political, and social orders
perceived as radically different and recalcitrant to its expansion"
(Nadarajah/Rampton 2015: 58). First, it is argued that hybrid peace
shares key assumptions, values and taxonomies with liberal peace through
similar logics of inclusion and exclusion. Second, [the
approach]{.underline} is said to [**depoliticize** and **romanticize**
the everyday and local spaces by **binarily constructing** them in
opposition to the]{.underline} international/[global]{.underline}
(Nadarajah/Rampton 2015). Paris (2010) argues that [much]{.underline} of
the [criticism of liberal peace is actually representing **variation**
within rather than **genuine alternatives**]{.underline}, [as they
are]{.underline}, [themselves]{.underline}, **[based on liberal
principles]{.underline}**. He argues that [there is **no realistic
alternative** to]{.underline} "**[some form]{.underline}**" [of
liberal]{.underline} peacebuilding [strategy]{.underline} (2010: 340).
He concludes that "[the challenge]{.underline} today [is not to
**replace** or **move**]{.underline} "**[beyond]{.underline}**" [liberal
peacebuilding but to **reform existing approaches** within a broadly
liberal framework]{.underline}" (2010: 362). Cooper, Turner and Pugh
criticize this argumentation stating all peacebuilding strategies have
common core prescriptions of "neoliberal policies of open markets,
privatisation and fiscal restraint, and governance policies focused on
enhancing instruments of state coercion and 'capacity building'" (2011;
2001). They argue that it would a more constructive approach is "to
acknowledge and investigate the variety of political economies in
post-conflict societies rather than measuring them against a liberal
norm" (2011; 1995).

Though a [legitimate critique]{.underline}, it [**does not provide an
answer** to the question of whether there is a **genuine** and **valid
alternative** to liberal peace]{.underline}. [In suggesting to
open]{.underline} peacebuilding [strategies to variable forms of
political economy]{.underline}, [thus **transcending** the neoliberal
paradigm]{.underline}, [they]{.underline}, however, [**fail to address**
whether or not such strategies will still fall under the]{.underline}
'**[broad canvas]{.underline}**' [of liberal peace]{.underline}.
Therefore, Paris' core argument that there is no genuine and valid
alternative to liberal peace is not challenged by Cooper, Turner and
Pugh. Also taking into account the critique of hybrid peace as a
"problem-solving tool" rather than alternative to liberal peace
(Nadarajah/Rampton 2015), it appears Paris is correct. The question of
what a genuine and valid alternative is is dependent on how we define
liberal peace as such.

The [debate on possible alternatives]{.underline} to liberal peace
[is]{.underline}, to a certain extent, [**obscured** by an **unclear
understanding** of what liberal peace means]{.underline}. [While critics
often emphasize the **neoliberal aspects** of liberal
peace]{.underline}, [proponents focus on the **broader meaning** of
liberalism]{.underline}. Paris, for example, highlights "individual
freedom, representative government and constitutional limits on
arbitrary power" (Paris 2010: 360) as the core principles of liberalism.
[While critics may view strategies diverging from the dominant
neoliberal]{.underline}, [top-down approach as]{.underline}
'**[alternatives]{.underline}**', for Paris, [the **only genuine
alternatives**]{.underline} to liberal peace [are **inherently
authoritarian**]{.underline}. He identifies three possible alternatives
-- [international agencies could]{.underline} either [install permanent
trusteeships]{.underline}; [identify local leaders who rule as
undemocratic strongmen]{.underline}; [or rely on traditional or
indigenous practices of peacebuilding]{.underline}. [The
first]{.underline} option [would come close to]{.underline} a
[colonial]{.underline}-type [control]{.underline}, [the second lacks
basic domestic legitimization and the third reinforces existing power
holders and is not free from external influence]{.underline} either
(Paris 2010: 357-359).

The study of authoritarian tendencies in peacebuilding and conflict
resolution remains underdeveloped. Scholars tend to focus on negotiated
settlements as the principal method of conflict resolution rather than
military victories (Toft, 2010). However, some have argued that we might
be witnessing a return to military victories which had been the norm for
resolving conflicts before the 'liberal moment' (Kovacs and Svensson
2013).

The Syrian crisis exemplifies this trend. Instead of declaring liberal
interventionism dead, because, allegedly, it was never more than "a
combination of post-imperial nostalgia with crackpot geopolitics" (Gray
2007), we might be better advised in reforming liberal peace. Otherwise,
in the absence of genuine alternatives, we risk leaving a vacuum that
can be filled by illiberal forces, as it happened in Syria.

The Syrian Crisis -- Towards Authoritarian Peace

In several recent conflicts like those in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and
Syria, Chechnya or Sri Lanka, we can observe a growing trend in military
victories, while liberal keystones of conflict resolution like an
inclusive peace process, power sharing, third party mediation and
security guarantees seem to lose importance. This form of 'victory
peace' has not been given adequate scholarly attention. The debate still
revolves around a post-liberal peace, problems inherent in liberal peace
and emancipatory, hybrid forms of peace.

Gray (2007) argues that, in a "global crusade for human rights",
pre-emptive war would be used to create a new world order, which would
lead to the rise of authoritarian regimes. [Pronouncing liberal
internationalism **dead**]{.underline}, however, [seems
**premature**]{.underline}, [especially in the **absence** of valid
alternatives]{.underline}. The example of Syria shows that [the rise of
genuine alternatives to liberal peace might be **worse** than what we
had before]{.underline}. The crisis in Syria, starting in 2011, is
characterized by a civil war entrenched in numerous realist interests
and responses that undermine its resolution. What is emerging in Syria
today is not any form of liberal peace induced by international agents
or a negotiated peace deal. Rather, it is best described as an
'authoritarian peace' (Lewis 2017). [Authoritarian tendencies are
**challenging** liberal peace]{.underline}, [not only in the domestic
sphere]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} also [in the
international]{.underline}. [The return of **Great Power
Politics**]{.underline} (Mearsheimer 2001) [and **illiberal
forces**]{.underline} in the Global North [are furthering
an]{.underline} "**[authoritarian peace]{.underline}**" (Lewis 2017).

Lewis, Heathershaw and Megoran argue that what they term as
authoritarian conflict management (ACM) constitutes "a set of coherent
policies and norms, rather than merely an aberration from liberal norms
of conflict resolution" (2018: 492). It entails "prevention,
de-escalation or termination of organised armed rebellion or other mass
social violence such as inter-communal riots through methods that eschew
genuine negotiations among parties to the conflict, reject international
mediation and constraints on the use of force, disregard calls to
address underlying structural causes of conflict, and instead rely on
instruments of state coercion and hierarchical structures of power"
(2018: 491). They argue that policies within this framework deny
grievances causing rebellion, instead locating the causes of conflict in
greed of political opponents and the opportunities arising from state
weakness. Therefore, these policies focus on reducing opportunities and
resources for rebel groups. This form of authoritarian conflict
management can be observed in the way Assad's government clung to power
and dealt with rebel forces from the start of the uprisings in 2011
until today. What began in 2011 with the Arab uprisings and people all
over the Middle East protesting for democratization, freedom of speech,
justice and freedom ended in Syria with a bloody civil war and a
military victory for the regime.

The period of 2014 until 2015 can be mainly considered as a political
and military stalemate in the conflict. While neither of the armed
actors was strong enough to seize territorial control over a longer
period of time, they were strong enough to continue the fighting. The
conflict's war economy continued to grow as the armed groups tried to
secure material resources. The distinction between regime and rebel
forces became more and more blurred as ISIS and other jihadist groups
emerged together with Kurdish groups, the Free Syrian Army and others.
The stalemate was fuelled, as international actors supported different
armed groups. In 2015, the Russian military intervention introduced new
dynamics into the conflict, not bringing it any closer to any form of
liberal, emancipatory or local peace but rather towards an
authoritarian, illiberal form of peace. Syrian government forces
disregarded international norms of combat by deliberately attacking
civilians and through the use of chemical weapons. By administering an
airstrike against a Syrian airbase in response to the breaking of these
norms, the United States tried to send a signal in defence of these
norms.

Paradoxically, while Russian intervention has accelerated Syria's
humanitarian crisis, it has also paved the way towards a political peace
process. In 2016, Iran, Russia and Turkey take over the peace process by
implementing the Astana process and alienating the Western states and
the UN. Both a ceasefire, arranged by the United States and Russia, and
the Ashtanga Agreement reached in May 2017 have led to a weakening in
the intensity of fighting between the various armed groups. The fight
against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in Eastern
Syria, led by the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces has, in
the meantime, taken up speed. In March 2019 the Syrian Democratic Forces
announced the final victory over the last ISIS stronghold after the
liberation of Baghouz. In April 2019 the peace talks in the newly
renamed Kazakh capital of Nursultan have continued into the 12th round.
Due to diverging opinions regarding which steps should be prioritized, a
breakthrough could not be achieved, however. While the military battle
is coming to an end, the most brutal conflict of recent decades is
turning into a fight about who gets to shape what is left after eight
years of war. The battlefield is now more and more geopolitical.

Not only the Syrian government's response to the civil war was
characterized by "authoritarian conflict management", also, the
international responses had little to do with the promotion of liberal
values. The increasing intervention of Russia, Iran and Turkey, and the
stalling and replacement of the Geneva peace process by the Astana
process is an indicator of a shift away from western liberal
internationalism towards an authoritarian peace. The international
competition for power and security has constrained states which could
have intervened more effectively leading to the biggest refugee crisis
of the 21st century. Yet, states have put their national security
interests above their obligations under the Convention on Refugees and
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ignored their
responsibilities to guarantee asylum to the survivors of the Syrian
civil war. In cooperation with the EU, Turkey, which presents the
transit point for most of the refugees from Syria, has agreed to accept
the refugees turned away by the EU. The international community has
further greatly disregarded its duties under the Rome Statute, the
Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Their efforts to intervene have
been blocked by Russia who is also acting to protect its own national
interests. The realist core assumption of an anarchic state system, in
which nothing is stopping states from ignoring their international
obligations to please their national interests, seems to be confirmed by
the Syrian civil war and international interventions. These realist
interests and responses have been a restrictive force against peace
efforts in Syria.

While the United States has been leading an international coalition
against ISIS and other extremist groups since 2014, it has ended its
military aid to the moderate rebel fractions like the Syrian Democratic
Forces. Apart from the much-contended missile strikes in 2018, the
United States and its Western allies have avoided direct contact with
government forces. Its stance on the Assad regime is unclear, while
Russia, Iran and Turkey have a much clearer picture of their interests
in the Syrian peace process. The outcomes and the further developments
are still to be seen, however. From what we know today, though, it is
fair to say that Syria is the signpost of the real crisis of liberal
peace in the contemporary world.

The Real Crisis of Liberal Peace

Even though we were celebrating the post-1989 'liberal moment' not long
ago, liberalism is in crisis again today. While the future seemed to be
moving towards the direction of democratic-liberalism, the rock of
modernity on which the liberal world order has been built on over 200
years seems to be crumbling now with the rise of non-western
authoritarian powers, populism in the West and beyond, and the return of
Great power politics. 1989, with the end of the bipolar order, produced
the notion of a unipolar world under American hegemony, the triumph of
free markets as the world opened up into a single world economy, and the
establishment of the liberal world order with its belief in democracy
and human rights and the building of new layers of global governance.
These developments gave a new impetus for a Europe as a peace project.
On a global scale it, at least on the outside, marked the end of
organizing international relations by threats and power. 1989 was not so
much a power shift, but a shift in the way in which power was organized.

Though liberalism has made inroads in states where it was least expected
it to -- as shown by the colour revolutions in the Ukraine, the Arab
spring, and the Green Revolution in Iran -- it is under threat in states
where it was thought to be firmly established. A strong populist
backlash in Europe and the United States is threatening the democratic
liberal order in the west and beyond, and the whole context of the
post-1989 liberal order has changed. "The unipolar moment", as
Krauthammer (1990/91) called it, is over. In the 1990s the primacy of
human rights over state sovereignty had the consequence of the increase
in humanitarian interventions. With the Iraq intervention, that idea has
died. Responsibility to Protect is a remnant of the previous focus on
humanitarian intervention in conflict zones, but it is not followed
through with, as has become clear with the Syrian crisis. Russia's
contemporary foreign policy, the annexation of Crimea, and its Syria
policy demonstrate the desire of greater international and regional
influence, confirming its legitimacy as a great power.

In a world where the logic of power is reasserted, the core of liberal
peace is challenged. In light of the comeback of victory peace, rising
authoritarian modes of peacemaking, and the rise of illiberal power on
the regional and international levels mark a crisis of liberalism, which
brings with it a crisis of liberal peace. The academic
**[debate]{.underline}**, however, [seems to focus on the
**insufficiencies** of liberal peace and]{.underline} thereby [**fails**
to reflect on illiberal tendencies that are **challenging** the liberal
paradigm as a **whole**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} does not consider
post-liberal peacebuilding and [fails to recognize that post-liberal
peace might look **very different** to what it anticipated]{.underline}.

While we have seen a "crisis in confidence and credibility" of liberal
peace during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the crisis in Syria,
[we might now be]{.underline} witnessing a real crisis of liberal
internationalism. Syria, now [moving towards an]{.underline}
'**[authoritarian peace]{.underline}**' [based on **perpetual violence**
and away from the liberal model]{.underline} of peacebuilding, enacted a
mode of "[authoritarian conflict management]{.underline}" which "[seeks
to]{.underline} prevent, de-escalate or [terminate]{.underline} violent
[conflict]{.underline} within a state [through]{.underline} the
**[hegemonic control]{.underline}** of public discourse, space and
economic resources [rather than by the liberal model of
**compromise**]{.underline}, [**negotiation** and
**power-sharing**]{.underline}" (Lewis, Heathershaw, and Megoran 2018:
499).

Furthermore, [the]{.underline} involvement of Russia, Turkey and Iran in
the peace process signal a [shift away from the western liberal
mode]{.underline} of international peacemaking. The Astana process [is
an example of the return to realist internationalism signified by the
return of **statism**]{.underline}, [**territoriality** and
**sovereignty**]{.underline}, non-interference and non-intervention,
**[proxy war]{.underline}**, [**negative peace** and
**militarism**]{.underline}, [with **inherent illiberal** and
**authoritarian tendencies**]{.underline}. With the rise of illiberal
populist forces in the West itself, the liberal moment of the post-1989
world order seems to be over.

This apparent crisis of liberal peace is, however, overshadowed by the
perceived 'crisis of confidence' (Cooper 2007). The [debate on possible
alternatives]{.underline} to liberal peace is centred on solving its
problems and failures and making peace more sustainable and
emancipatory. The critical discourse around liberal peace thus
[**obscures** state-led authoritarian modes of]{.underline} conflict
management and [international interventionism]{.underline}, [guided by
national self-interest]{.underline}, [by illiberal great
powers]{.underline}. [While the critical discourse **heavily
criticizes** Western]{.underline} peacebuilding [efforts]{.underline} in
Afghanistan or the Balkans, [it **does not adequately
capture**]{.underline} the [prevailing authoritarian
tendencies]{.underline} in contemporary conflict management and
peacebuilding.

[The history of liberal internationalism is]{.underline}, however, [one
of struggle and counter-struggle]{.underline}. [The current
crisis]{.underline}, thus, [does **not** have to signal its
**end**]{.underline}. [Considering that the **only genuine alternative**
to liberal peace is **illiberal peace**]{.underline}, [we might be
better off by **saving liberal peace itself**]{.underline}. Critical
scholarship should take note of authoritarian trends and the changed
international environment and explore [alternative routes]{.underline}
to liberal peace [within the liberal paradigm]{.underline}, an option
that [should be **preferred** over allowing]{.underline} illiberal
forces dictate [a new paradigm of illiberal peace]{.underline}. [Making
liberal peace **more emancipatory** and **sustainable**]{.underline},
for example, by paying attention to hybridity, [might be our **only
chance** to fight against authoritarian tendencies]{.underline} in
conflict management and peacebuilding.

#### Liberal norms of law and sovereignty [reduce international conflict]{.underline}.

**Gill-Tiney, 22**---Lecturer, Department of Politics and International
Relations, University of Oxford (Patrick, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth
of Liberal Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of
Conflict Resolution, 2022, Vol. 66(3), 413--442, dml)

This article shows that [[liberal]{.mark} interpretations of
**[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [emphasize]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[free
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[democracy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**individual [rights]{.mark}** and **freedoms**]{.underline}, [have
become **increasingly prevalent**]{.underline} in UN Security Council
resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states, Russia/Soviet
Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the content of
these resolutions reflects broad consensus between major powers---both
western and non-western---as how these norms should be interpreted. This
is not the same as arguing that these states share preferences or
interests, rather, substantial differences remain, largely along the
cleavage between the United States, Britain and France on the one hand
and China and Russia on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1
Yet, the collective positions of these states have evolved over time,
suggesting a shift in how sovereignty is understood. The dominant role
that these states have in shaping the international order means that
[their collective understandings may be taken as representative of the
**normative structure** of international society at any point in
time]{.underline}, [with the expectation that this impacts **all**
states in the system]{.underline}.2

I argue that [[as liberal]{.mark} interpretations of these fundamental
[norms **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the **likelihood
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a dispute participant resorting to
**[[violence decreases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through content analysis
of all UN Security Council resolutions between 1970 and 2014 I first
create a measure of the strength of liberal interpretations of
sovereignty. This is then utilized in quantitative analysis of dispute
participants in the period to explain the variation in the level of
violence employed. [I find **statistical** and **substantive support**
for my theory]{.underline}, [showing **[empirically]{.mark}** that [the
growth]{.mark} in liberal norm interpretations [is **negatively
associated**]{.mark} with the likelihood of]{.underline} a state
resorting to [violence]{.underline} in an interstate dispute.

[This is [not]{.mark} to argue [that structural]{.mark}
[arg]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark} [are **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, far
from it, [nor is it to **reject** the roles of conventional and nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} in shaping interstate conflict behavior.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[state power does
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. However, [the
**intersubjective ideas** they carry with them into disputes
are]{.underline} also [**crucial** to understand why some disputes
**escalate**]{.underline}, [and others do **not**]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), though NATO is
understood as a structure, a security community is more crucially formed
around shared values (norms). Kahl argues that the basis of the
democratic peace is collective identity rooted in liberal democracy
interlinked by intergovernmental organizations (1998). For Risse, the
influence of NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States
demonstrates the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which
relies upon the similarity of domestic political institutions in these
liberal democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable
additions to the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its
treatment of the subject, these works fail to tackle the question of
whether the democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two
are entwined throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating
and operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, [the
more normatively important question is how to avoid
**escalation**]{.underline}, [as this **reduces the costs** of
war]{.underline}: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

[Escalation]{.underline} then, [is a **political**
decision]{.underline}. In making the choice to escalate, or not,
[policymakers are]{.underline} impacted by a range of strategic factors,
but crucially, are also [constrained by **norms**]{.underline}. [The
[use of force]{.mark} in international relations [must be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN Charter
specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace enforcement. To
this, we might also add humanitarian intervention, though this remains
contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with dispute onset,
policymakers must justify their actions with reference to one of these
reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[policymakers are]{.mark} also
**[constrained by liberal values]{.mark}** which emphasize
diplomacy]{.underline}, [cooperation]{.underline}, [international
law]{.underline}, [international organizations]{.underline}, [the rights
of the individual]{.underline}, [and to question the legitimacy of the
march to war]{.underline}. Taken [together]{.underline}, [[this **slows
the decision to escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[since legal
justification is **needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diplomacy is
**necessary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and potential]{.mark} economic and
human costs **[understood]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**calculated** and
**defended**]{.underline}. [A shift toward liberal interpretations
thereby means a **reduced probability of escalation** to
violence]{.underline}, tacitly assuming that the risk of a dispute
arising in the first-place is unchanged. This leads me to my first
hypothesis, which relates to the evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute]{.underline}, [the risk of
escalation **decreases** as liberal interpretations
**increase**]{.underline}.

An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers, typically resulting from
system-wide conflict results in qualitative differences in
interpretations of fundamental norms between peace-periods. Whilst the
end of the Cold War did not involve a system-wide war, it did mark the
end of sustained rivalry between great powers. The pre- and post-
periods can thereby be compared. Given the rivalry of the United States
and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the relative dominance of the
United States post-Cold War, we might expect qualitative differences in
conflict behavior to be observable in the two time periods,
attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon liberal
interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic change in the
distribution of power triggered a significant change in the consensus
surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of international
society. This leads me to my second hypothesis, which captures the
tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute escalation decreases given a systemic
increase in **liberal interpretations of sovereignty**]{.underline}
attributable to the end of the Cold War.

Method

I use multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of change in
the normative landscape on the use of force by dispute participants. To
address the underlying selection problem, that is, that dispute onset is
non-random, I also estimate maximum likelihood and twostep Heckman
selection models. Substantive significance from the logistic regression
is then explored utilizing the observed values for predicted
probabilities approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan 2013). Standard errors
are robust and clustered by year, where model specification allows (that
is, not in the Heckman twostep model). This is to take account of the
data structure since years differ by the number of Militarized
Interstate Disputes (MIDs) which onset and the number of participants in
these MIDs. Because the independent variables are annual values, the
same value is given to all dispute participants in the same year. If
standard errors were not clustered by year then there would be
substantial withincluster correlation.

[This]{.underline} paper [models]{.underline} the hostility level of
interstate [disputes as a **monadic** phenomenon]{.underline}. [Much of
the literature]{.underline} on democratic peace theory [utilizes a
**dyadic** setup]{.underline}, either directed or undirected. I opt for
a monadic structure for three reasons, firstly, because [many of the
theoretical explanations for the democratic peace are]{.underline} in
essence, **[monadic]{.underline}** explanations, with a dyadic version
layered on top. For instance, the core claim of much of the literature
is that democracy reduces the hostility of foreign policy, a monadic
claim, because leaders are accountable to citizens who have a low
tolerance for the costs or war, and because legislatures and a free and
independent media provides greater scrutiny of policymaking, slowing the
march to war. The dyadic version of this---the interaction of joint
democracy---relies on the signals that these same processes provide to
another actor. It is puzzling, therefore, that empirical findings have
tended to show support for the latter, but not for the former. Secondly,
[the **difficulty** in finding empirical support for any monadic
explanation means that [a **higher threshold** is]{.mark} being
[set]{.mark} here [by]{.mark} using [a monadic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly, the argument I make, that
liberal norms reduces the hostility level of interstate disputes, may
have varying effects according to the regime type of dyads. However,
that claim is not made here, rather I argue that these norms exist for
all in international society, not for a subset, and that they act
directly upon policymakers, not only when policymakers interact with
their international counterparts.

### AT: Realism Ks

#### Balance-of-power concerns [structure]{.underline} state behavior, even if they can't explain [everything]{.underline} states do. 

**Blagden, 18**---Senior Lecturer in International Security at the
Strategy and Security Institute, Department of Politics, University of
Exeter (David, "Realism, Uncertainty, and the Security Dilemma: Identity
and the Tantalizing Promise of Transformed International Relations,"
*Constructivism Reconsidered: Past, Present, and Future*, Chapter 12, pg
205-216, dml)

The previous section documented how [[social variables]{.mark} **might**
be taken [as]{.mark} having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly [state interests]{.mark},
they [are]{.mark} **necessarily [subordinate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
political **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as a sovereign entity with
control over its own foreign policy), "physiological"
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the safety from death and harm of
the state's population), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a baseline level of which is
necessary to ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and
its population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [[That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes---or,
indeed, often---[[make ideationally driven]{.mark} foreign policy
[choices]{.mark} that are **detrimental** to their other interests. [It
is]{.mark} simply a description of [states' **incentive structure**,
which **much of the time** they]{.mark} end up
[follow]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.

[It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to defend the notion that
[there is]{.mark}, in fact, [a **material base independent of the social
world**]{.mark} and [that]{.mark} characteristics of that material base
[can yield **causal outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all,
[military technology does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but
rather is created via **human agency** in response to perceived
threats]{.underline}, and thus it necessarily contains a dose of
military culture and broader social identity from the outset. The same
goes for the overall share of national economic resources allocated to
defense, and indeed, money itself is a socially constructed store of
value, albeit one premised upon underlying materially underpinned
wealth.38 Any assessment of strategic priorities is necessarily filtered
through the strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the
assessing; asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of
sea denial versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an
answer infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its
role in the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth.
The broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation.

Even technologies with such seemingly self-evident destructive power as
nuclear weapons are not self-evidently "good" or "bad," either morally
or strategically, absent social interpretation. One might see them as
"bad" because of the potential humanitarian consequences of their use
(or because of the constraints they impose on conventional military
options), or "good" because of the casualties in conventional war they
prevent (and deterrence that they enable at low relative cost). Their
political meaning is thus socially constructed, even if the
physiological effects on human bodies of their detonation have only one
possible outcome. If military technology and resources require a social
component to be both developed and meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's
contention that there is indeed a "rump" material base but that it is
simply indeterminate---in the absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as
a cause of international outcomes becomes alluring.39

Crucially, however, [each of these social choices involves a **decisive
material effect** that is **not open to interpretation**. It may be
debatable whether nuclear weapons are "**good**" or "**bad**," but the
**effect** that one will have]{.underline} on the city and its
population of frail, carbon-based human animals over which it detonates
[represents a **single**, **determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a
state facing another state armed with them must therefore make certain
necessary calculations based around that capability.40 In the same vein,
[while]{.underline} the [strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline}
constituted by geographical features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed
by the United States and United Kingdom, [may be a matter of
interpretation, the **underlying material
factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water without
spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have been
spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines.

[The same goes for the decision over what **share of**]{.underline}
national economic [**resources** to allocate to defense. Choosing a
proportion may indeed be a **socially** and **ideationally informed
political choice**, but the **underlying size** of the resource
pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that they underpin---
rests on the total size of the state's capital stock (both human and
physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[[while the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}, including resources
and technology, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed necessarily
[[interpreted through]{.mark} states' [social lenses, it]{.mark}
nonetheless **[conditions]{.mark} the bounds of [the possible]{.mark}**
even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when those
possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are necessitated by
prudent states seeking survival for their populations.

Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [[viewing]{.mark} total [state power in terms of
**overall assets**]{.mark}]{.underline}, defined as the state's total
stock of physical,43 financial,44 and human capital,45 [[does a **better
job** of]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[encompassing]{.mark} all the
**[relevant resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of
value, human bodies and brains---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, second,
[[providing an **effective measurable proxy** for the **underlying
causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}]{.mark} (given that [the
latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is therefore **not an
effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}). [[None of this is to
**deny**]{.mark} that there is [a **social element**]{.mark} to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that [states' power]{.mark} resources [and
their effects are **not wholly socially constructed**]{.mark} and that
the nonsocial element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}.

Turning to specific arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion
that achieving a particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a
certain international-social role might be a goal of states is
relatively uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent
constructivist work on Britain's pursuit of international status
suggests at the outset that states' social roles are not the same as
their interests, ambitions, values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work
later asserts that social role actually produces national interests,
thus implying that states cannot in fact have interests besides those
constituted by identity.48 Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a
theoretical dilemma: the more minimal former assertion is the harder to
refute, yet the more ambitious latter claim is necessary if
constructivists are to escape the realist retort that fulfilling a
social role is merely an interest of states---and a subordinate one to
materially underpinned survival at that---rather than the interest.
Escaping this retort is in turn necessary if constructivists are to be
able to claim that anarchy is indeed what states make of it socially,
since transforming the prevailing culture of anarchy would require
states to lower their guard against each other---and thus accept higher
risk to their survival, at least while the hoped-for transformation was
taking place---in pursuit of an international-social value.

The less contentious point---that playing a particular social role is
one of multiple interests---opens the way to conceding that the most
fundamental state interests remain "political" survival (of state
territory and institutions), "biological" security (of the citizenry's
bodies), and preserving some baseline level of economic prosperity,
since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve anything else. But if
that is the case, then from these materially underpinned vital interests
follows a need to be capable of defending them against potential
foes---and that, if it comes to it, means accomplishing certain military
missions.49 Such military capability is necessarily underpinned by
material resources, even as it also has a socially constructed
dimension. Such capability can be provided independently (internal
balancing), via allies (external balancing), or through some combination
of the two---prudent strategy, including eschewing avoidable
confrontation and aligning with the preferences of powerful allies, is a
key aspect of state success50---but either way, it rests on some
friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on external
balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by European
NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51

In short, [such an analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social
role and status are important to states, all else held equal, and that
such concerns sometimes drive them to act in imprudent
ways---nonetheless [suggests that hedging]{.underline} against
abandonment, coercion, or outright destruction [via balance-of-power
positioning is **likely to remain pervasive**. This is **not to say**
that there will not be variation in the **extent** and **severity** of
such competition. All manner of ideational variables might exacerbate or
reduce tensions]{.underline}, as discussed above, and even in the
absence of such social forces, overt, intensive competition may yield
self-destructive outcomes if it increases another side's insecurity and
causes them to adopt a more offensively capable strategic posture in
response.52 [The point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict
will never be a **wholly absent possibility** and that that reality
**must condition states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the
point of some level of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources
and technology to make that feasible---even in times of broadly
cooperative relations.

[[A similar retort can be made against the claims]{.mark} that threat
perception and military [doctrine are]{.mark} both [so]{.mark}
**fundamentally [skewed]{.mark}** [by culture that they may be]{.mark}
**commonly** and **wholly [disconnected]{.mark}** [from balance-of-power
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for an end
to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition. While
this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive review, the
success of many states--- particularly resource-rich ones---in aping
military technological and professional best practice would seem to
suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve what Gray,
borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force postures in
the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states do "die" in
the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in post-1945
international politics---it is more often as a consequence of their
relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as a
consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [[as a
description of]{.mark} the **workings of [the international
system]{.mark}** as a whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to
be), [[realist predictions]{.mark} of enduring concern and possible
competition over the distribution of material power [are **not
undermined** by]{.mark}]{.underline} this recognition.56 Tellingly,
despite their strong **[[ideational commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
toward democracy promotion and human rights enforcement under the banner
of upholding international order, Western states have recently had the
reprioritization of balancing against increasingly capable rivals forced
upon them by developments in the balance of power, whether that be
China's rise in Asia for the United States or Russia's (partial)
resurgence in Europe for the rest of NATO.57

Finally, [even **[national identity]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[[is]{.mark} itself
[forged by]{.mark} the interaction of **political group identity** and
the **survival imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To
paraphrase Tilly, [war **makes the state**, and the state **makes
war**]{.underline}.58 [Modern nation-states may have **originated** as
political groups of individually weak human beings with some shared
identity connection, but their choice to **form states** as protective
war machines capable of generating]{.underline} the military
[power]{.underline} necessary [to defend]{.underline} against similar
political units, [and the subsequent mutual reinforcement of national
identity and state strength, is **very much consistent** with realism's
predictions of [the **consequences of**]{.mark} **international
[structural anarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted earlier,
Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and realism are
mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War world, moreover,
mutually threatening political groups' need to generate the military
power necessary for security under anarchy---the security dilemma, in
short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious ethnonationalist and
sectarian conflict within and between the new states emerging from the
collapse of previously multiethnic communist federations, secular Middle
Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such conflict has in turn forged
the identity of the states and state-like entities emerging from it. In
short, [while it is **certainly not impossible** for national identities
to shift]{.underline}, as noted above, [the **process** of their
generation nonetheless suggests that they are **endogenous** to---rather
than **readily capable of exogenously shifting** to
transform---international systemic security competition and
balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are as much a
dependent variable as an independent variable.

Uncertainty and the Menacing Shadow of the Future

The previous section outlined why some of the otherwise most convincing
[constructivist variables]{.underline} at work in international politics
nevertheless [**cannot promise** to transform international politics
away from a world of "**realist**," **security-motivated
balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This section turns to
discuss why [this is something that social variables will **continue to
struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}.

[The **principal barrier** to states ever setting aside their
inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace each other
as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline} leaders' or
citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of international
anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others' intentions]{.underline},
particularly their future intentions.61 Following the logic of the
prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts that another means it no harm
while the other state concludes that it now has an opportunity to pursue
advantage may be punished severely for its complacency, rendering such
trust perilous, particularly in security affairs, where defection from
cooperation could result in the end of the "game" for one party.63

The meaning and implications of this "uncertainty" assumption merit
consideration, however. Human beings are constantly trying to impose
certainty on a contingent world via cognitive heuristics and neural
shortcuts, for the sake of their own mental well-being.64 Indeed, since
humans derive meaning and value from the self-imposed certainty of
ideational reinforcement, so too they can derive benefit from the
entrenchment of both amity with and enmity against "others," even when
this creates other complications and dangers.65 As a result, much of
international politics is influenced by habit, both the habit of
friendship and the habit of animosity.66 "Uncertainty" also means
different things to different people: for realists, it is a condition
from which to infer fear about others' possible behavior; for
constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer to the inherent
indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with social content.67
It may be possible to build trust in others' benign intent over time and
thereby escape security competition, meanwhile, through their costly
signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options that a potential
aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can also have the
certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing against a
third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so too may be
the certainty of alliance.69

Illustrating this "uncertainty about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the
highest profile oft-invoked security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation
of U.S.-Soviet hostility, during which the most seminal security dilemma
theorization took place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72

Jervis's "recantation" of the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself
bounded, however, and this bounding sheds light on the ways in which
varieties of uncertainty can still operate even between states with
"certain" mutual intent. "Greedy" states versus "security-seeking"
states are themselves binary ideal types that mask an underlying
spectrum. Practically all states are greedy, in terms of wanting to
improve their lot, if the costs are low enough.73 Conversely, few states
are greedy to the point of total unconcern for security; not even Nazi
Germany desired limitless global war. While there may not have been
uncertainty over each side's Cold War intent, therefore---enmity-driven
desire to defeat and ultimately destroy the other---there was still
uncertainty over underlying motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an
enemy population may entail quite different behavior than a desire for
ideological supremacy, for example, and the two may therefore merit
different policy responses, even though both fall within the domain of
"hostile" intent. Such doubt over motivations---even within the
cognitively "certain" domain of U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a
variety of security dilemma: [[the **most salient question**]{.mark} for
Americans [was not "**is the Soviet Union an enemy?**" bu]{.mark}t
rather "[**what might Moscow do** about situation X, in Y circumstances,
at time Z?"]{.mark} The same is evident]{.underline} in major power
politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether or not China
and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in broad and
obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty** over what
**types** of rivals they represent and their **associated future
strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76

On top of these qualifications to the uncertainty-over-intentions
assumption come disagreements over the most appropriate response to such
uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never know another state's future
intentions with mathematical certainty, and therefore that the
worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by a concealed
aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility **does
not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is **maximized**
by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}. Provoking war
for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide for fear of
death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile behavior,
provoking others into uniting against oneself through attempted power
maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77 [While worst-case
contingencies **always merit consideration**, [policy
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of
the national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus
consumption and productive investment ("butter")78---[[**necessitates
probabilistic calculations** of]{.mark} the relative dangers of
**[overarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} (provoking balancing alongside
domestic economic immiseration) [[versus
**underarmament**]{.underline}]{.mark} (attack by a better-armed
adversary).79 Intense security competition can therefore be an
irrational and self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future
intentions, in the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and
"constructivist" variables can feature among this threat data and
therefore play a crucial part in determining the optimal strategic
response to such intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions
whether the potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they
latent or realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many
realists, the offense-defense balance of technology and geography
determines whether uncertainty over others' intentions merits military
confrontation and determines the (in)stability of states' strategic
relations.81 For constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of
sociocultural similarity/difference may be equally decisive.

But [**neither** of these observations---that uncertainty neither
carries a single meaning nor prescribes a single strategy---undermines
the **core claim** that survival has a **material base** that
necessitates **continual security-motivated concern** for one's position
in the balance of power. Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be
"**multiply realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables
informing the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables.
[But]{.underline} given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a
materially based hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on
others' politically contingent (and therefore capricious)
benevolence---whether that be potential abandonment by erstwhile allies,
potential attack by erstwhile neutrals, or potential coercion by
either---their [position in the balance of power will **always remain
relevant** to their future security]{.underline}. And [given that
situation, the conditions for **mutual threat** and an associated
**security dilemma** to re-emerge are **unlikely to be permanently
expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a deterioration going unrealized
indefinitely in many cases due to other overlying factors.82 [Fear of
future conflict]{.underline}---at least against some state, if not
against any specific state---thus [remains an **endemic feature** of
international politics]{.underline}. And much of that is still down to
the enduring concerns of structurally based realism:
international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable sovereign
enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of offensively
capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent.

Tellingly, while many contemporary states have achieved mutual
"friendship," they have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors
holding them together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared
membership of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other
mutually beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others.

As a consequence, [[the **base conditions** for the security dilemma
will **always exist**]{.mark} between sovereign states under anarchy,
[even if it lies]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly
**[[dormant]{.underline}]{.mark}** for most states most of the time,
thanks to overlying factors. [Interstate [friendship does not]{.mark}
render deterioration to [a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither
does]{.mark} interstate [animosity **preclude**]{.mark}]{.underline}
stable and durable **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.88 [So while
identity---which]{.underline} in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to
change**---certainly matters to security relations, it is **unlikely to
trump** some combination of **power** and **informational
variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if international relations were
transformed by the emergence of a single world-state, the system would
no longer be anarchic and the units-formerly-known-asstates would not
need to rely on relative power for their security, and thus such
competition would end.90 That requirement, however, does not look likely
to be fulfilled anytime soon.

Conclusion

[Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**" condition,
but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too the
[security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over motivations
[are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be that
permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far more
peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism would
seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as well as
the power and informational variables beloved of realists---clearly have
something to do with this. [[Interests]{.underline}]{.mark} within the
parameters of continuing to survive [[are **socially
constituted**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and even the route to survival
itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [[But]{.mark} the
need to safeguard [a]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}ly underpinned
[hierarchy of interests]{.mark}** if states are to continue to
exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite to performing any kind of
social role---[still [incentivizes]{.mark} them to **value their
position** in the [balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.mark}]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course,
[[states **can** and **do** disregard certain incentive
structures]{.mark} in favor of others]{.underline}.92 [[But until
**all** states]{.mark} are known to [have done so---a **high
bar**]{.mark} **indeed**---[the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} in the international system
[[will]{.mark} **continue to [exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And knowing
that, states will continue to prize the capabilities to provide for
their own security . . . and so on, creating enduring conditions for
security dilemmas to one day reappear, even though they go overlain by
other factors in most international relationships most of the time.

Both realists and constructivists therefore have work to do, in terms of
both refining their paradigmatic cores and recognizing the necessity of
analytically eclectic cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most
pressing questions** of real-world international politics]{.underline}.
Realists must do more to incorporate identity as a variable that
produces systemically significant variation in behavior rather than as
some adjunct bolt-on, whether that be via the post-1990s boom of
neoclassical theorization or attempts at microfoundationally elaborated
structural realism.93 Porter's work on the interaction of power and
habit in determining US grand strategy is a good recent example,
while---as noted earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key
benchmark.94 Constructivists, for their part, must continue to
investigate the relationship between states' potentially infinite array
of socially constituted interests, their materially underpinned
hierarchy of core survival requirements, and the enduring concern for
relative power that the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides
must be **circumspect** in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**"
examples]{.underline}. For realists to claim that structure alone
explains World War II or the Cold War, for example--- missing the
universalist ideologies of German Nazism, Soviet communism, or US
liberalism---would be a stretch indeed. Equally, constructivists' most
beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian relations along an easily
passable land border, the relative underarmament of Germany and Japan,
greater American fear of a few North Korean atomic bombs than hundreds
of British thermonuclear warheads, the rise of European Union, and so
forth---can all be readily explained with reference to balances of
capability and information. "Analytic eclecticism" is easy to profess,
but the most pressing contemporary questions of world politics require
that theorists practice it too.

[For those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or
"**isms**" debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[[there is scope for]{.mark} **any number** of midlevel
[theories]{.mark} of foreign policy [under the **constraint of**]{.mark}
**still [recognizing]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} interstate
[balance-of-power considerations]{.mark} **continue to
[structure]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} international
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

(by IR postmodernists and feminists, for example) [**[do not]{.mark}

[scholars]{.mark} have [**marginalized themselves**" so that]{.mark}
"instead of engaging" with postmodernists, "[most]{.mark}
scholars]{.underline} (even their fellow constructivists) [are **quite

is as much about the epistemological and normative commitments of the
discipline as it is about postmodernism and, in any case, it is a
pattern of all post-Cold War IR theorizing, not just postmodernism. As
Sylvester notes, "[[**debate**, once]{.mark} thought of as [a
**disciplinary sport**, is now]{.mark} **mostly confined to [within-camp

"ironic as it might be, [the professional IR camp scene]{.underline}
today [**[can seem conservative even as it is liberating]{.mark}**:

[This]{.underline} way of looking at sustainability allows the

5\. Discussion

The distinct roles of environmental science and technology in addressing
humanity's sustainability challenges, can be better understood when
considering the different nature of science and technology. The
contribution of science, as a curiosity-driven endeavor, and that of
technology, as invention and the application of knowledge (Smith, 1994),
have resulted in numerous discoveries that have improved the quality of
human lives (Bradford, 2015). Science is driven by curiosity, and
technology by utility, both are necessary and interdependent, and while
they clearly complement each other, they can become dysfunctional when
they converge (Linden, 2008). Science is more than a source of
technology, and technology cannot solve environmental problems just by
applying scientific knowledge. To ensure that scientific progress
delivers benefits, we need to invest in systematic ways to apply
scientific knowledge to the many challenges we face, to invest in
technologies that not just address sustainability challenges but create
sustainable futures for all. Many "scientific" solutions have failed
when experts applied explanations and solutions out of context to
physical conditions or social behaviors (Forsyth, 2011).

The environmental science-technology convergence we see today, limits
both science's potential to deliver knowledge and technology's to
deliver change, and leaves the public confused in terms of what to trust
and believe. The pressure on science to serve environmental policy and
deliver fast, tangible, and useful results to industry or society, can
shape scientific agendas (Koppelman, Day, Davison, Elliott, & Wilsdon,
2010), compromising curiosity-driven research, threatening the autonomy,
impartiality and neutrality of environmental science and biasing
research design (Parkhurst, 2016). Scientists are increasingly under
pressure to communicate their research better, to interact with the
public, and prove the "societal impact" of their work (Cairney, Oliver,
& Wellstead, 2016). They are often criticized for being unable or
unwilling to demonstrate the impact that policymakers demand, industry
requires, and society needs. While many resent this, they nevertheless
have engaged more with industry and policymakers (Poppy, 2015), who are
no longer willing to hand over billions of pounds of taxpayers' money in
exchange for a vague promise that something good will come from it (Dudo
& Besley, 2016). Still, many scientists view themselves as neutral,
disinterested and objective. They aspire to fill the role of the
rational and authoritative arbiter of environmental disputes, often
potentially unaware that they are also prey to a host of psychological
and contextual frailties (Burgman 2015b). Despite the shared ambitions
of many scientists and policy-makers about the role of science in
environmental policy, the evidence environmental scientists produce
often is not what policymakers require (Burgman, 2015a).
University-based scientific research is rarely tailored to
policy-makers' objectives and constraints (Fleming & Sorenson, 2001;
Burgman, 2015a). The majority of environmental science research has
failed to engage with the political nature of decision making and
environmental scientists rarely influence how evidence is used (or
misused) (Parkhurst, 2016). On the other hand, when scientific opinion
becomes irrefutable, it generates what Walton (1997) called a culture of
technical control. In this paradigm, the solution to decisions about new
technologies, for instance, is seen to be through public education so
that the correct scientific solution is transferred directly into
correct policy (Burgman, 2005). There is a naked assertion in this
situation that the identity of the proponent warrants acceptance of the
proposal (Walton, 1997).

Then again, when environmental science is driven by policy its
reputation in many contexts relies on its ability to deliver successful
outcomes on environmentally pressing issues. It is increasingly
considered to be more reliable and valuable when enhanced by social,
industrial and government influences, rather than when protected from
them (Sarewitz, 2016). Concerns have diminished that this reflects a
gradual shift from scientific freedom towards an emphasis on objectives,
designated by the economy or society's current requirements (Pinto,
2015). The view that the primary aim of science is to seek the truth, is
often considered the "myth of purity," in contrast to the idea of a
"well-ordered science" whose principle intention is the satisfaction of
social preferences, or the protection of the natural environment in the
case of environmental science (Kitcher, 2001). This has led to concerns
that environmental science's internal quality control mechanisms could
be impaired by political and economic incentives (Berg, 2010; Stephan,
2012) or ideologies such as environmentalism. The economic benefits
derived from the development of novel, successful technologies, contrast
with broad-based "curiosity" oriented research (Karle, 1995). Policy
makers should not drive scientific agendas, and academia should avoid
proselytizing, instead providing vital substance for discussion and
debate (Bell, 2017).

The line between environmental science communication and advocacy is
diffuse. Ideologies are a means by which people organize themselves to
attempt to make the world a better place (Gee, 2015). Unfortunately,
scientific training does not always guarantee rational, bias free,
evidence-based reasoning. Kahan (2013) observed in debates about climate
change and biological evolution that many people adopt a position, one
that accords with the views of their peers or their social context, and
then select scientific arguments to defend that position. A person's
scientific or technical training do not protect them from post-hoc
rationalization. Instead, technical training only serves to help them to
use selective scientific evidence more effectively. Climate scientists
have been challenged on their objectivity, by skeptics within politics,
the media, and the public (Skoglund & Stripple, 2018). While most
evidence indicates that such accusations may be overstated
(Bromley-Trujillo, Stoutenborough, & Vedlitz, 2015), with no strong
indication that the scientific community is blurring the lines of
scientific objectivity, there remains a risk that a significant increase
in advocacy by scientists could be an unwelcome change, decreasing the
likelihood that their discussions of the risks of climate change would
be believed.

[A key]{.underline} accelerating [factor]{.underline} for this [is
**public scientific literacy**]{.underline}. Arguably, [education is the
**most important** application of science, the technology with
**enormous potential** to address the **challenges facing
humanity**]{.underline}. But the convergence of science and technology
has had a profound effect on education too. It has become an instrument
for economic progress, moving away from its original role to provide
context for human development (Kromydas, 2017). Producing graduates for
both science and technology markets' needs is a challenge, as the skills
of scientists are not the same as those needed to address environmental
challenges (Table 1), and for society to progress sustainably it needs
both. Science funding increasingly encompasses a cycle that moves from
discovery to invention to adoption and back again; a model that aims to
break down disciplinary walls (Jasanoff, 2010), but does not acknowledge
barriers to collaboration. [Effective collaboration **depends** on
training in interpersonal skills including]{.underline} building trust,
**[communication]{.underline}**, **[listening]{.underline}**,
leadership, **[creative problem solving]{.underline}**,
**[decisionmaking]{.underline}**, [and **conflict
management**]{.underline}. [Successful translation of science
**depends** on systems that encourage **lasting**]{.underline} personal
**[relationships]{.underline}**; [**shared research agendas** and
**priorities**]{.underline}; **[mutual respect]{.underline}** that
arises from working closely together to deliver research outcomes;
[**reciprocity** and **personal interactions**]{.underline} between
policy-makers and scientists (Burgman, 2015a). [Most]{.underline}
scientists [are unlikely to cross this divide
**unassisted**]{.underline}. Instead, immense pressures on scientists
arise from the commercialization of scientific research, measures of
performance that generate perverse incentives, and economic or
ideological drivers shaping scientific agendas. These predispose
scientists to conditions that lead to the erosion of public trust
(McGarity & Wagner, 2008).

The process of turning knowledge into change cannot be undertaken
without significant effort (Ostrom et al., 2010). An American
Association for the Advancement of Science review (2016) showed that a
[lack of knowledge **undermines** public support for science as an
institution, promotes **opposition** to action to address problems like
**climate change**, and fosters **reservations** about scientific
advances and emerging technologies]{.underline} (Nisbet & Markowitz,
2016). Others have also reported that civic science literacy is
positively associated with public support for scientific research and
for federal funding for science and technology (Lee, Scheufele, &
Lewenstein, 2005). Thus, [science may have a **critical role** to
empower the public to engage in change]{.underline} (Kirkman &
Voulvoulis, 2016).

Science is a deliberate, rational process, but for those seeking to
understand, manipulate or build systems, their "complex" nature often
demands approaches that go beyond reductionist scientific models or
traditional engineering design methods because of their
unpredictability, non-linearity, interconnectivity, hierarchy and
"emergence" (Bale, Varga, & Foxon, 2015). For environmental solutions to
be effective, interdisciplinary research should couple human and natural
systems. [Technological change is a **multi-layered process** that
unfolds **unevenly**]{.underline} in time and space, often [beyond
individual]{.underline} scientists' [perspectives]{.underline}
(Sorensen, Bloch, & Young, 2015).

While there is a clear role for environmental science in the production
of knowledge, environmental [technology has a **distinct role** in
facilitating social change]{.underline}. [There is a
**need**]{.underline} for a new breed of professionals who are able [to
make **practical use** of results, bring **public understanding** to the
support of science, **teach**, **negotiate**, **facilitate** and deal
with **complex ethical** and **policy issues**]{.underline} (Tobias,
1997). [They will apply knowledge delivered by science, **bridging the
gap** between science and society]{.underline}, without putting academic
freedom at risk. [Environmental technologists will engender]{.underline}
participatory thinking together with [a **more holistic understanding**
of the ways we **depend** on nature and the ways nature is **affected**
by people, **informing**]{.underline} technology [**assessments** and
**developments**]{.underline}. [They will **engage** with policy
makers]{.underline}, stakeholders [and the public]{.underline}, [to
**better define** environmental problems]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
support society to [**implement** the]{.underline} integrated,
interdisciplinary and holistic [**solutions required** to deliver real
change]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} process [may
require]{.underline} transformative innovations, changes of industrial
practices, and **[new]{.underline}** environmental
**[policies]{.underline}**. Environmental challenges require a new
contract between science, technology and society, one [that]{.underline}
recognizes the importance of all three and [deliver]{.underline}s
[**synergies** enabling]{.underline} all of [them to reach their **full
potential**]{.underline}.

### AT: Tech Controls Desire

#### Cybernetics don't overdetermine the psyche.

**Beardsworth, 10**---Head of the School of Politics and International
Studies and Professor of International Politics at the University of
Leeds (Richard, "Technology and Politics: A Response to Bernard
Stiegler," Cultural Politics (2010) 6 (2): 181--199, dml)

Just as Stiegler gives us a technological reading of political economy,
so he also gives [a technological reading of **libidinal
economy**]{.underline}. (They are obviously one and the same reading
given his synthesis of both to describe the specificity of cognitive
capitalism; I have broken them down here for analytical purposes.) Since
the 1990s Stiegler re-thinks the Freudian problematic through technics
(see Stiegler 1996b). Technics constitutes the condition of sexuality
qua [[desire]{.underline}]{.mark}. This critique of Freud inscribes the
whole of the psychical apparatus within the technical history of
epiphylogenesis. It is clear that human sexuality has both evolved and
is altered through technical developments. Stiegler is right to insist,
with the paleontologist Leroi-Gourhan and Gilles Simondon, that
hominization is a technical process of evolution and psychic and
collective individuation. That said, sexuality [[is **not reducible** to
technics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Human sexuality, together with the
problematic of [[desire]{.underline}]{.mark} that it underpins, [[both
**transcends**]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological deter[mination and
is]{.mark} itself [dependent on **many variables**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There are [depth psychological constants]{.underline} (for example, the
Oedipus complex) that [determine the]{.underline} transgenerational
[legacy of the id **beyond technical evolution**]{.underline}. [[To
argue]{.mark} otherwise]{.underline} (as Stiegler does; see 1996b) [[is
**not to engage** with]{.underline}]{.mark} the autonomy of the depth
psychological. What with the **[[neuroscience]{.underline}]{.mark}**s\'
penetration into the mind--body complex, we are probably only now
beginning to under stand this autonomy and multi-causality.

[Stiegler]{.underline} is therefore correct, following Herbert Marcuse,
to place technics within the evolution of sexuality and the vagaries of
desire. There would be no Oedipus complex, specific to human animals,
without the technological evolution of the human. But he [**goes too
far** when he makes the relation between technics and
desire]{.underline} one of **[unilateral determination]{.underline}**.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} above [[arg]{.mark}ument
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} the
"**[[psychotechnologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[are
attempting]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[to **control**]{.underline}]{.mark}
the id," if not "[[the **psychical apparatus**]{.mark} in
general]{.underline}" (2009: 31), is one consequence of this unilateral
determination. This [is another **technologically determinist
judgment**]{.underline}. [It [makes a **background condition**]{.mark}
([tech]{.mark}nology) [into a]{.mark} **radical [determination]{.mark}**
[of the psychic apparatus as a **whole**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
determinism tempts Stiegler into arguing for a general "crisis of
spirit" at the moment of cognitive capitalism.

Let me recall in this context that, for Freud, sublimation (the
[turning]{.underline} of [desire into law]{.underline}) [constitutes a
**complex process** that is dependent on **many contingent
factors**]{.underline}. In distinction to all other animals, humans
sublimate because they are diphasic: we undergo the latency period and,
therefore, puberty---due, without doubt, to our technological
specificity. As a result of this diphasic nature, the human animal turns
its love of its protectors into an identification that, with the
reversals of puberty, comes to structure and occupy the space of the
superego. Identifying with our parents (and their parents, etc.) or
taking distance from them constitutes, from the beginning, a complex
process of love and hate that may lead, from puberty onwards, to too
rigid a superego or too dissipated a one (or rather, to variations
in-between). Freudian [psychoanalysis suggests that it is **very
difficult** to generalize]{.underline} with regard to this development.
The absence of identifiable, recurrent, and protecting love can indeed
create an uncoordinated psyche. It leads, in this case, to other forms
of parental identification that are always ongoing in the infantile
years precisely because the id transcends technically organized memory.
[[Until the nuclear family is **literally dissolved**]{.mark} and **not
replaced** by another form of social organization]{.underline}, [[we
**cannot**]{.underline}]{.mark} consequently [[speak of a new generation
that has **lost its**]{.mark} **primary [identifications]{.mark}**
and]{.underline}, therefore, following the Freudian logic of
sublimation, lost [a **sense of the future**]{.underline}, of law, and
of justice. [There are **too many variables** at play within
the]{.underline} depth [psychological dynamic]{.underline} of infantile
protection and care for Stiegler to be so clear. [Under new conditions
of technology]{.underline}, [one must be **proactive** and **prudently
regulate**]{.underline} Internet flows (regarding collective security,
obscenity, etc.). One must, however, wait to see what new forms of
parenthood adopt the hyperindustrial support and what new forms of
sublimation will come to structure [the coming generations\' [sense of
conscience]{.mark}]{.underline}. These new forms may be weaker than
either traditional or modern forms of the close social bond. But this
[[**cannot** be a cause of]{.mark} excessive
[concern]{.mark}---**[unless]{.mark}** this polemical pitch is
[**judged** to be the right means to **attract** ]{.mark}**political
[concern]{.mark}** [and **change**]{.mark} **public
[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and even here, I am unsure that it is).
Ontologically speaking, these forms may lead to more innovative and
creative behavior as much as to destructive and self-destructive
behavior. I am arguing that we cannot know at this very early stage of
our hyperindustrial age, although Stiegler is nevertheless right to call
for critical synthesis. The political adoption of the hyperindustrial
support will take time---as did monotheism to adopt non-orthographic
writing and the social contract to adopt the alphabetical word.

The above uncertainty regarding the direction of the contemporary
technology--human symbiosis constitutes, in Stiegler\'s terms, the
"ambivalence" of technology. In Freudian terms, it is more simply the
complexity of the human mind--body complex (on these themes, see
Beardsworth 1996b). In these processes there is a constant dialectic
between "negative" and "positive" sublimation: here, the reduction of
law to capitalism on the one hand, and the embedding of capitalism
within artistic and legal forms on the other. Stiegler cuts the knot of
[this]{.underline} ambivalence too quickly, or rather, generalizes too
fast from almost exclusively French examples of de-sublimation (see
Stiegler 2008a, esp. on the advertising techniques of Canal J.).

Regarding Freud, I would argue, in sum, that [Stiegler]{.underline}
gives a strong, original reading of contemporary affective life through
the bridging of technology and the psyche. Conversely, it is a
technological re-reading of Freud that [**flattens** out the vagaries of
human affect and human conscience]{.underline}, [**preventing** a
**nuanced**]{.underline}, [**comparative account** of the relation
between contemporary consumerism and normative thought and
behavior]{.underline}. As a result, public education may be posited too
quickly by Stiegler as the right political response.

This is not to deny the need for change in public education: far from
it. The Internet clearly poses a problem. As the contemporary teacher
knows, Internet-surfing produces a form of consciousness that is adept
at "copy and paste," but finds synthesis and judgment increasingly
difficult. Stiegler\'s politics of critical reflection, with its
emphasis on the vital role of education, is in this sense persuasive.
That said, I would wish to keep a sense of global perspective. As is
well-known, use of the Internet was crucial to the election of Barack
Obama: it helped create a cultural transformation that proved strong
enough to shift the American political landscape to the center. The use
of mobile phones has transformed the electoral process in West Africa.
The Internet is, in other words, already highly creative politically.
Education must certainly help to supplement this emerging creativity
with the art of judgment. Obama\'s domestic fate regarding healthcare
reform since the campaign has shown, at the same time, how powerful the
traditional media remain in shaping political perception and interests.
Progressive liberal [politics]{.underline} in one of the most
technologically savvy of countries **[depends]{.underline}** as much
[today on **restructuring**]{.underline} the
**[power-bases]{.underline}** of the traditional media as it does on
providing an education in response to capitalist-led technological
transformation of human memory. Stiegler would not disagree with this
last point. As I said at the beginning of this paper, his political
voluntarism was in the 1990s singular on the French theoretical
continent. It means, to my mind, however, that [philosophico-political
reflection should consider the **political adoption** of technology at
**several levels** of **analysis** and of **policy**]{.underline}, [in a
spirit of **prudence**]{.underline}, [and with a sense of **intellectual
limits**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

I have addressed the work of Stiegler through the names of Marx and
Freud. In doing so, I have attempted to suggest that his work goes too
quickly over what puts a break on the destructive side to capitalism.
The future political project of democracy is, without doubt, to embed
capitalism at the world level. And democratic freedom means that one
must renounce gratifying one\'s immediate desires. This means political
institution and self-restraint. Stiegler focuses rightly, and sometimes
brilliantly, on the urgency of the political today, and on the
importance of a political adoption of contemporary forms of industry
within a general intellectual framework of retentional finitude. This
latter framework of analysis is theoretically innovative and
disciplinarily rich. [[Not to analyze the]{.mark} forms of
[**institutional change** at the appropriate level]{.mark} and not to
give credit to]{.underline} the **[specificities]{.underline}** of
sublimation within capitalism [tend]{.underline}, however, [to
[make]{.mark} capitalism\'s field and dynamic **too
uniform**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Stiegler\'s
[[responses]{.mark} to it [**too unilateral** and]{.mark} **too
[general]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([if not]{.underline}, **[[too
French]{.underline}]{.mark}**). As a result, [his theoretical world
**turns too quickly**]{.underline}, [at the precise moment when a
**slower speed** and a **finer set of distinctions** are
needed]{.underline}. Not that [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} not
[**enormous [danger]{.mark}** in our present world]{.underline}, not
that a sense of urgency is not vital. Our [[description]{.mark} of it
**[requires]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [theoretical [terms that
exposit]{.mark} it in [its **complexity**]{.mark} [so that theory can
provide]{.mark}]{.underline}, precisely, [the occasion for **suitable
[political adoption]{.mark}** [and **decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Unsustainable

#### Tech innovation doesn't [doom]{.underline} liberalism, it [makes it sustainable]{.underline}. We control uniqueness because abandoning liberal epistemologies [cedes]{.underline} technology to [authoritarians]{.underline}.

**Crawford, 21**---founder and CEO of Roots of Progress (Jason, "Why
Liberals Should Care About Progress,"
<https://symposium.substack.com/p/why-liberals-should-care-about-progress?s=r>,
dml)

The case for a free society is a broad integration across many subjects,
including history, economics, and moral philosophy. Central to this
integration is the topic of human progress---specifically, the
[scientific]{.underline}, [technological]{.underline},
[industrial]{.underline}, [and economic progress]{.underline} that [has
been **dramatically raising** standards of living around the
world]{.underline} for over two hundred years. Understanding the
history, nature, and causes of progress should be a focus for anyone who
wants to defend philosophical liberalism, for three reasons.

First, [the history of progress is a **validation** of the modern world
and its institutions]{.underline}.

[Since about **1800**]{.underline}, [most of the world has **escaped**
from poverty]{.underline}. In the industrialized world, [the average
person]{.underline}, [who once lived without
**refrigerator**]{.underline}, **[toilet]{.underline}**, [or **running
water**]{.underline}, [now has **all** of these
conveniences]{.underline}; many also enjoy a vacuum cleaner, dishwasher,
and microwave. [Working conditions have **improved** as jobs moved from
farms to factories to offices and as machines took over physical
labor]{.underline}, [while working hours **declined**]{.underline} from
over 60 hours per week to under 40. [Famine]{.underline}, [once
**relatively common**]{.underline}, [is only a **distant memory** in
most of the world]{.underline}. [Where **almost 1%** of mothers once
died in childbirth]{.underline}, [and **half** of all children died
before the age of fifteen]{.underline}, [child and maternal mortality
today have **plummeted by orders of magnitude**]{.underline}. [Speedy
powered transportation and instant electronic communications have
**connected the world like never before**]{.underline}, to the benefit
of commerce, science, education, and cultural understanding. And the
ability for the majority of the globe to access virtually the entirety
of world art, literature, and philosophy has enabled unprecedented
intellectual and spiritual enrichment.

[These benefits have not been shared **evenly**, but they have been
shared **broadly**]{.underline}. [Every country on Earth today has a
life expectancy higher than **any** country did in
**1800**]{.underline}. [Every continent has now achieved a food supply
of **over 2,600 calories** per person per day]{.underline}. [And global
poverty is declining by **almost any metric you
choose**]{.underline}---[not only in **relative** terms]{.underline},
[but by many metrics]{.underline}, [in **absolute** terms as
well]{.underline}. (And no, it's not just China.) [All of these metrics
still have a **long way to go**]{.underline}, [but they have **come
far** in the last two centuries]{.underline}---[further
than]{.underline} they had in **[all the millennia
before]{.underline}**.

[These grand achievements are due at least in part to
**liberalism**]{.underline}: free markets, free trade, free migration,
and most fundamentally the free and open exchange of ideas.

The enormous economic growth was due in large part to increases in
productivity which were brought about by private enterprise: the spinner
and weaver left their cottage industry to operate machines in factories;
the farmer traded his horse-drawn plow for a gasoline tractor; the
blacksmith laid his hammer down upon his anvil and took up the steel
rolling mill and press. But for such enterprises to thrive, old
institutions had to be dissolved: the restrictive guild system, which
often opposed new techniques; the arbitrary granting of royal
monopolies; the corvée system of forced labor. More importantly, new and
better institutions had to be created. The railroads, representing a
massive buildout of transportation infrastructure, depended on the new
legal form of the limited-liability corporation to raise the required
capital. And inventions, from the cotton gin to recombinant DNA,
depended on the protection of the patent system.

Industrial [civilization is also founded on **science**]{.underline}:
the thermodynamics of **[engines]{.underline}**, the
**[electricity]{.underline}** that powers lights and computers, the
**[chemistry]{.underline}** that fertilizes our crops, the
**[antibiotics]{.underline}** that cure disease. [The birth and growth
of science]{.underline}, starting around the 16th century, [was based on
a **new epistemic principle**]{.underline}: [a commitment to **reason**
and **empiricism**]{.underline}. But it was also based on a new social
principle: a commitment to free and open debate. To embrace reason and
empiricism, the leaders of the Scientific Revolution needed to shove
aside tradition and authority. Scientists had to be free to speak
against revered but mistaken theories, from Aristotle's physics to
Ptolemy's geocentric astronomy to Galen's "four humors." The motto of
the Royal Society, Europe's premiere scientific institution of the 17th
century, was nullius in verba---"on no one's word."

Both free enterprise and free thought were aided by the free movement of
people between nations. Migration protected heretics: If during the
religious wars they were persecuted in a Catholic country, there was
often a Protestant country happy to take them in, and vice versa.
Descartes wrote his Meditations in the Netherlands when religious
intolerance was growing in France; Hobbes wrote Leviathan in Paris
during the English Civil War. Later, during the rise of capitalism,
migration brought economic opportunity. Many of the most successful
entrepreneurs were immigrants, from the Scottish-American Andrew
Carnegie, who brought cheap steel to America, to the Turkish-German
founders of BioNTech, Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, who brought a COVID
vaccine to the world.

The dramatic rise in global living standards, then, is a vindication of
freedom in all its forms.

Sadly, not only is this achievement rarely celebrated, it is not even
broadly known or believed. A 2017 survey asked people whether they
thought global poverty over the last 20 years had halved, doubled, or
stayed the same; only 5% of US respondents, and less than 10% of those
in the UK, correctly answered that it had halved. And in 2015, fewer
than 10% of people polled across several countries believed that "the
world is getting better".

[Some]{.underline} even [claim that technological]{.underline} and
industrial [progress]{.underline} have not on the whole been good for
humanity. They argue that progress has destroyed jobs, that it ruins the
environment, that it [has created **looming existential
threats**]{.underline} to our species, that it doesn\'t actually make
people happier, [and]{.underline} that in any case it [is
**unsustainable**]{.underline}. So Jeremy Caradonna asks "Is \'Progress'
Good for Humanity?," Jared Diamond calls agriculture "the worst mistake
in human history," David Barash calls modern civilization a "Ponzi
scheme," Kate Raworth and Naomi Klein call economic growth an
"addiction," Clive Hamilton and James Gustave Speth call it a "fetish,"
and Giorgos Kallis advocates an entire "degrowth" movement. On the
right, religious traditionalists rail against the supposedly empty and
thoughtless "materialism" of our wealthy, industrialized society.

If this were a fair assessment of progress, it would indeed be high time
to overthrow liberal values and institutions and to replace them with a
revolutionary new model for society.

Thus, a defense of liberal philosophy requires a defense of progress. It
requires showing that, [despite the **real problems** it has created and
the **challenges** that lie ahead]{.underline}, [material progress has
been **on balance a massive good**]{.underline}.

The second reason why progress is central to the defense of
philosophical liberalism is that [the story of progress points us to a
**positive vision** for the future]{.underline}. [We can use
science]{.underline}, [technology]{.underline}, [and industry to
**create a better world**]{.underline}. [We can **cure heart
disease**]{.underline}, **[cancer]{.underline}**,
**[AIDS]{.underline}**, **[obesity]{.underline}**, **[mental
disorders]{.underline}**, **[genetic diseases]{.underline}**, [and
**even aging itself**]{.underline}. [We can design **self-driving cars**
that will save time]{.underline}, [eliminate road deaths]{.underline},
[and make personal transit affordable]{.underline} to many more people.
[We can shrink the world further with **supersonic passenger
travel**]{.underline}, going from New York to London in under four
hours, or Seattle to Tokyo in under five. [We can **end air pollution**
and **control the climate**]{.underline}. [We can colonize]{.underline}
the solar system, and perhaps one day [the **galaxy**]{.underline}. [We
can even **reverse extinction**]{.underline} and bring back the wooly
mammoth (though maybe let's pass on the velociraptors). [We
can]{.underline} "**[grow the pie]{.underline}**" [and make it possible
for **everyone** on Earth to attain today's **highest living
standards**]{.underline}---[and then **continue to raise
them**]{.underline}.

But to achieve these things, we must set our sights on them. We must
recognize that just as we today are fantastically wealthy compared to
past generations, so too our descendants, generations hence, can be
fantastically wealthy compared to today. This positive vision, beyond
just a conservation of the values and institutions of the past, should
be a large part of what motivates a defense of liberal philosophy.

Finally, the lessons of progress point the way to the solutions to the
real problems of the modern world, the failures of its institutions, the
justified criticisms of its elites.

The progress lens helps us see that [in broad terms]{.underline},
[almost none of our problems are new]{.underline}. [Job
loss]{.underline}, [information overload]{.underline}, [technology
accidents]{.underline}, [and environmental damage are all challenges we
have **tackled before**]{.underline}. [The **solution** to these
problems]{.underline}---[even the ones **created by progress
itself**]{.underline}---[is **more progress**]{.underline}. [We can
address climate change with **new energy technologies**]{.underline}
([including **nuclear** and **geothermal**]{.underline}), **[carbon
capture]{.underline}**, [and **geoengineering**]{.underline}. [We
can]{.underline} ([and will]{.underline}) [**create new jobs** to
replace ones lost]{.underline}---[and we can **make reskilling easier**
and otherwise **improve job mobility**]{.underline}. [Information
technology gave us **distraction**]{.underline}, [but better information
tools can **enhance focus**]{.underline}; [it took away our
**privacy**]{.underline}, [but it can also give us **encryption** and
other tools to **rebuild privacy stronger than ever**]{.underline}. [And
we can obtain **gene safety** through responsible
processes]{.underline}, [thoughtful standards]{.underline}, [and safety
technologies such as]{.underline} those being developed by [the **Safe
Genes** program]{.underline} at DARPA.

[Credible approaches to these concerns **must be clearly articulated
within the framework of liberal principles**]{.underline}, **[and
soon]{.underline}**---[or]{.underline} "**[solutions]{.underline}**"
[will be offered from]{.underline} elsewhere on [**regressive** or
**authoritarian principles**]{.underline}. A deeper study of progress,
especially how similar challenges have been dealt with in the past, can
inform and inspire new solutions for the future.

More broadly, [the growing attack on]{.underline} philosophical
[liberalism is fueled in part by a **feeling** that the world is in
**decline**]{.underline}. This is [reinforced by an **increasing
distrust** of elites and institutions]{.underline}---[including the ones
that helped **make** the modern world]{.underline}, [such as
**entrepreneurs** and **venture capital**]{.underline}, [**scientists**
and **universities**]{.underline}, [even **courts** and the **rule of
law**]{.underline}. [The feeling is that elites]{.underline},
[institutions]{.underline}, [and liberal values have **failed**
us]{.underline}, [that they offer **no vision** for the
future]{.underline}, [and **no solutions** to the problems they
created]{.underline}.

[The truth is the **opposite**]{.underline}: [liberal philosophy has
**worked**]{.underline}. [It has created **abundance**]{.underline},
**[empowerment]{.underline}**, [and **safety for all**]{.underline}. [It
offers a **compelling vision** for the future]{.underline}, [and the
**solutions** to our problems and fears]{.underline}. Explicating this
argument is central to defending the values of a free society.

#### Growth is [sustainable]{.underline}---newest data that doesn't link to their Ks. 

**Pearce, 22**---environment and development correspondent for the
Breakthrough Institute, writing regularly for Yale Environment 360 among
others, citing Narasimha Rao, Associate Professor of Energy Systems,
Yale School of the Environment (Fred, "Green Growth Won't Kill the
Planet," Breakthrough Journal, No. 15, Winter 2022, dml)

[Rao's findings ought to have a **profound impact** on the divisive
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} on climate change, [[which]{.mark}
continues to [pit]{.mark}]{.underline} the attempts of developing
countries to eliminate poverty by mimicking [Western modes of
[development]{.mark}]{.underline} against many in the West who see this
path [[as **ruinous**]{.mark} for the planet and]{.underline} ultimately
[**self-defeating** for the poor]{.underline}. [They
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} both **[[wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
truth, [there **need be no incompatibility**]{.underline}. Ecomodernists
are right: [humanity can **have its cake** and **eat it**]{.underline},
too.

Rao, who grew up in a middle-class family in Mumbai but with poverty
around him, is now at Yale University and the International Institute
for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), an Austria-based intergovernmental
think tank. He has spent years as what he calls an "interdisciplinary
scholar," addressing both technological advances and social equity and
how they might interact.

He says that, until recently, little climate-change analysis, social
research, or futurology has seriously addressed whether climate and
living standards can be fixed together. Ecomodernists stepped in with
strong [[belief in]{.mark} the power of transformative
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} to both deliver abundant energy and
break the umbilical cord linking prosperity to pollution. But theirs
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [predominantly **supply-side** and
**[top-down]{.mark}**]{.underline} perspective, [which can lead to a
presumption that the benefits]{.underline} of prosperity and abundant
energy [will **trickle down**]{.underline} to deliver decent living
standards for all.

Critics like Anna Walnycki and Tucker Landesman at the International
Institute for Environment and Development say a top-down perspective
risks increasing social and economic inequality unless "policies are
shaped around the needs of ordinary citizens," especially those in
low-income urban communities. Moreover, as Rao points out, energy
inequality around the world is even greater than income inequality. And
by some measures, more income seems to only increase energy
inequalities, according to analysis by researchers at the University of
Leeds.

To grapple with such issues, [[Rao's work]{.underline}]{.mark}, centered
in the Decent Living Energy project, [[takes a **bottom-up**]{.mark}
approach]{.underline}. It starts [with an [assessment]{.mark} of the
**hard material needs** for eliminating
poverty]{.underline}---particularly for the billion-plus people living
in informal urban settlements without decent housing, sanitation, water,
and other basic services---[and does the work of separating out the
energy needs for eradicating poverty from those to meet the demands of
affluence]{.underline}.

In this way, [Rao has added **real numbers** to the idea of a decent
living]{.underline}, [[**upending** past]{.mark} global
[measures]{.mark} of poverty]{.underline}, which were removed from the
real lives and material needs of the poor. The most widely used is based
on the single metric of daily income per head. Once a dollar a day, the
cutoff has now become \$1.90 per day for extreme poverty, with a higher
threshold of \$5.50 per day used by the World Bank for
upper-middle-income countries. Almost half the world's population does
not achieve this standard. But what you can buy with those dollars
varies vastly round the world, as does what you need to purchase to
achieve a decent standard of living. Other measures have looked to
well-being outcomes, most influential among them being the UN's Human
Development Index, which is based on life expectancy, years of
schooling, and income. But it does not set a threshold level, or measure
what material requirements are needed to get to an "acceptable"
(different from "good") outcome.

Rao, with his colleague Jihoon Min, attempts to do better by identifying
a shopping bag of material requirements, or "satisfiers," that are as
near as possible universal prerequisites for a decent modern life. They
call these requirements "material conditions that people everywhere
ought to have, no matter what their intentions or conception of a good
life, or what other rights they may claim."

Those material needs fit into 10 broad indicators of basic human
well-being: nutrition, shelter, living conditions, clothing, health
care, air quality, education, access to information and communication
services, mobility, and freedom to gather and dissent. A person who
achieves them does not necessarily have a life that a wealthy person in
the West would recognize as comfortable. But they would have a life that
could be called decent and dignified.

Many of these requirements derive from widely accepted benchmarks, but
others go further. For instance, nutrition requires not just sufficient
calories, but also vitamins and minerals and a refrigerator to store
food safely. There's also the need for a cooker that does not fill the
home with smoke, part of the air-quality category.

Shelter and adequate living conditions require not just a roof over your
head, but also sufficient floor space (depending on household size,
typically 30 square meters per person), durable home construction, and
sufficient heating and cooling equipment for "thermal comfort." Also
required is "sufficient clothing to achieve basic comfort" and access to
a washing machine.

Health care and living conditions requirements include on-premises
sanitation and water supplies (50 liters per head per day), plus access
to adequate health care facilities and a minimum of one physician per
1,000 people.

The social well-being criteria include not just nine years of education,
but also access to communication networks including one phone and one
television or computer per household. These new needs, Rao and Min say,
may not appear essential to life, but are "globally desired by an
overwhelming majority of people," so not to have them risks social
disengagement and ostracism. The electronics need not be personally
owned, they note, but access is vital.

The same holds for mobility, which they regard as necessary for social
engagement and employment or selling wares. The decent living
requirement is set at access to motorized transport, such as a bus or
motorbike, sufficient for an average of around 25 kilometres per person
per day.

Rao and his colleagues' analysis of needs is often surprisingly
granular. Current thinking holds that households of a similar income
level around the world generally want the same appliances. His household
surveys nuance that. While most people in most places do want a TV,
cellphone, and refrigerator, his study with Kevin Ummel found washing
machines are less universally desired, and ovens and tumble driers even
less so. Race, culture, and religion are all factors. Patterns also
differ depending on whether people live in urban areas and on the status
of women; urbanity and greater equality both drive up demand for
appliances connected with cooking and washing. People who consume a lot
of milk products---such as Sikhs in India---want a refrigerator more
than those who do not.

White people, Rao and Ummel note, are more fixated on white goods---that
is, large electrical appliances. But they care less about motorbikes and
some cooking equipment such as rice cookers, which are much more
widespread in Asia.

It is impossible to say what proportion of the world's population meets
all Rao's standards---or none. Some places far outstrip the basics. The
average American has almost six times the "decent" level of floor space
and consumes almost seven times as much water. Germans average four and
2.5 times those "decent" levels, respectively. But Rao's estimates
suggest that only two-thirds of people have attained half of them, with
nutrition the most achieved and mobility the least. In fact, "the
majority of the global population does not currently have decent levels
of motorized transport," coauthor Jarmo Kikstra of Imperial College
London, has pointed out.

All [this **confirms** findings from Rao and his colleagues'
analysis]{.underline} published in the September Environmental Research
Letters that "more people are deprived of DLS \[decent living
standards\] than are income-poor." Worldwide, [**more than three
billion** people lack access to clean cooking options]{.underline},
space [cooling]{.underline}, [sanitation]{.underline}, [and
transport]{.underline}, and [**more than two billion** lack cold
storage]{.underline}, [decent housing]{.underline}, [and proper access
to clean water]{.underline}.

[In **sub-Saharan Africa**]{.underline}, [**over 60 percent** of people
do not have access to]{.underline} eight of the requirements for [a
decent standard of living]{.underline}, with deficits for cooling,
sanitation, transport, water access, cold storage, housing, television,
and clean cooking. [In **South Asia**]{.underline}, **[over
half]{.underline}** the population lacks adequate sanitation, transport,
cooling, clean cooking, water access, and cold storage.

Most standards are almost universally met in rich nations. Yet the data
also show that a third of North Americans and 44 percent of Western
Europeans miss out on transport needed for mobility, while in both
regions about a tenth miss out on decent sanitation. This means that,
around the world, in every corner of it, hundreds of millions of people
need more, and no green transition that denies it to them could be
considered sustainable or just.

The Cost of Decency

But [can the gaps in access around the world be
**filled**]{.underline}---and **[without crashing the
climate]{.underline}**?

To be sure, [creating a world where everyone can have a decent living
standard will require **new public infrastructure** and **more private
energy use**]{.underline}. As Rao points out, [much of the progress will
only be achievable collectively]{.underline}---through public water
supply and sanitation services, clinics, schools, public transit,
cellphone networks, and so on. Much else will be best secured---and with
lowest energy needs---collectively as well, with better public transport
rather than an automobile in front of every house, for instance.

But the great takeaway is that [**truly [essential]{.mark}** [needs
are]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Rao says, mostly "[**[cheap]{.mark}** in
terms of energy]{.underline}." Doing some calculations based on the
information in Rao and his coauthors' Environmental Research Letters
article, [the [infrastructure needed]{.mark} to meet decent living
standards worldwide by 2040 [will add **less than 4 percent** to]{.mark}
current consumer [energy demand]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Half of that will
be for improved housing]{.underline}, [a quarter for public transit
systems]{.underline}. [Annual requirements to sustain those living
standards would add a further **17 percent**]{.underline}, [making a
total increase]{.underline} in energy needs to meet decent living
standards of the world of [just around **20 percent**]{.underline}.
[That compares with an expected increase in energy demand]{.underline},
[**without** ensuring decent living standards]{.underline} for all, [of
around **50 percent**]{.underline}.

Put another way, these authors say, "essential energy needs to meet
everyone's basic needs . . . could constitute a small share of projected
energy growth, namely, around an order of magnitude lower than current
US energy demand." And [their [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
authors point out, [[assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[only
modest]{.mark}** efficiency [improvements]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather
than relying on an ideal, high-tech future."

[The [energy needed]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words, [[may be
**even less**]{.mark} than the]{.underline} headline [figures
suggest]{.underline}. For the poorest billion or so on the planet,
[[reductions in deprivation]{.mark} will often [come with **reductions
in energy use** and]{.mark} **environmental
[impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Marta Baltruszewicz and her coauthors at
the University of Leeds have recently shown from studies in Nepal,
Vietnam, and Zambia that the households with higher well-being
indicators used more energy than households with lower well-being.
Without access to electricity or gas, the researchers found, low
well-being households burned more firewood and charcoal than their
higher well-being neighbors, resulting in more pollution and
deforestation. And lacking clean drinking water, they were forced to
constantly boil dirty water to make it safe. Overall, the study found
that "[households achieving well-being have **60%-80% lower** energy
footprint]{.underline} of residential fuel use" than the average in
those countries.

The bottom line, according to Rao's coauthor Alessio Mastrucci of IIASA,
is that "[we **do not have to limit** energy access to basic
services]{.underline}. . . . [even under **very ambitious**]{.underline}
poverty eradication and climate mitigation [scenarios]{.underline},
[there is **quite a lot** of energy still available for
affluence]{.underline}."

Just how much, of course, matters a great deal for those of us in the
rich world with energy-intensive lifestyles and a social conscience. But
even before considering any energy technology transformation that can
provide more power with fewer emissions, there is hopeful news.

The affluent still consume most of the planet's resources, with the
wealthiest tenth of the planet's population consuming 20 times more
energy than the poorest tenth. But there has been increasing discussion
about whether [some [rich nations are reaching]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[peak stuff]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [a **tipping point** beyond
which material needs **no longer rise** with
wealth]{.underline}---[[and]{.mark} may even **fall**]{.underline}. For
example, Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University has long argued that
[Western societies]{.underline} in general [[are starting to
**dematerialize**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And [the [evidence is **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as **studies**
increasingly call into question the presumed ratchet linking wealth and
energy demands]{.underline}. For example, Europeans consumed 18 percent
fewer raw materials in 2020 than they did in 2008, according to the
European Commission. The British government's Office for National
Statistics calculated that the personal materials footprint of the
average Brit---in food, textiles, construction materials, metals, fossil
fuels, and so on---fell from 24.2 metric tons in 2001 to 13.4 metric
tons in 2020.

Some of [this decoupling is due to **long-standing trends**
in]{.underline} improved technological [efficiency]{.underline},
[combined with **more recent digital innovation**]{.underline}. A single
smartphone replaces a computer, a compass, a newspaper, and an alarm
clock---not to mention a radio, a camera, a magnifying glass, a
flashlight, and a music player. One optical fiber can do the work of a
thousand copper phone wires. Global digital camera sales have declined
by 87 percent in the past decade, as cameras in phones take their place.

Both [**public** and **private [consumption patterns]{.mark}** [are
changing]{.mark} in other ways]{.underline}, too. In the public domain,
[the assembly of infrastructure tends to **peak** as economies rapidly
industrialize]{.underline}, [and then **falls**]{.underline}. (That is
why China has, in recent years, consumed 20 times more cement than
America, and around eight times more steel too.) Even US president Joe
Biden's trillion-dollar infrastructure plans may not reverse this, since
those appear to have less to do with cement and steel structures than
broadband connectivity and power grids.

And [American consumers are increasingly spending]{.underline} their
money [on **experiences** rather than on **disposable material
goods**]{.underline}, according to McKinsey & Company analysts. Their
findings suggest that, whereas prior generations defined themselves
through their possessions, we now define ourselves more through our
experiences, both real and virtual. The new car in the driveway matters
less than the vacation you take with it. We don't eat more, but instead
go to more and better restaurants. We don't buy ever more cheap
furniture; we buy quality. Other [modern [lifestyle choices]{.mark} may
also **[drive down]{.mark} material** and **energy
[requirements]{.mark}**]{.underline}: eating less meat, going to the
gym, and meeting up remotely rather than in person, for instance. People
were driving less even before the COVID-19 lockdown.

[If such trends **continue**]{.underline}, [and if energy becomes **less
carbon-intensive**]{.underline}, [it would not be a stretch
to]{.underline} imagine a world that can [achieve **decent living
standards for all** with **few environmental tradeoffs**]{.underline}.

#### If we win this, it's offense---sustainability's only possible with the [commitment to innovation]{.underline} that the alt [rejects]{.underline}.

[One argument against long-term growth is that we will **run out of
resources**]{.underline}. Malthus worried about running out of farm
land, Jevons warned that Britain would run out of coal, and Hubbert
called Peak Oil.

Fears of shortages lead to fears of "overpopulation". If resources are
static, then they have to be divided into smaller and smaller shares for
more and more people. In the 1960s, [this led to **dire predictions** of
famine and depredation]{.underline}:

[But predictions of catastrophic shortages **virtually never come
true**]{.underline}. [Agricultural productivity has grown **faster**
than Malthus realized was possible]{.underline}. [And oil
production]{.underline}, [after a **temporary decline**]{.underline},
[recently hit at an **all-time high**]{.underline}:

One reason is that [predictions of shortages are based on **conservative
estimates** from only proven reserves]{.underline}. Another is that
[when a resource **really is running out**]{.underline}, [we
**transition off** of it]{.underline}---as, [in the
**1800s**]{.underline}, [we switched our lighting from **whale oil** to
**kerosene**]{.underline}.

But [the **deeper reason** is that there's **really no such thing** as a
natural resource]{.underline}. [**All** resources are
**artificial**]{.underline}. [They are a product of
**technology**]{.underline}. [And economic growth is ultimately
driven]{.underline}, [not by **material resources**]{.underline}, [but
by **ideas**]{.underline}.

In the 20th century, [the **crucial role** of ideas was confirmed by
**formal economic models**]{.underline}. The economist Robert Solow was
studying how output per worker increases as we accumulate capital, such
as machines and factories. There are diminishing returns to capital
accumulation alone. A single worker who is given two machines can't be
twice as productive. So if technology is static, output per worker soon
stops growing:

But [technology acts as a **multiplier** on productivity]{.underline}.
[This makes each worker **more productive**]{.underline}, [and creates
**more headroom** for capital accumulation]{.underline}:

[So we can have]{.underline} economic [growth **if**]{.underline}, [and
**only if**]{.underline}, [we have **technological
progress**]{.underline}.

How does this happen? Another economist, Paul Romer, pointed out the key
feature of [ideas]{.underline}: In economic terms, they
[are]{.underline} "**[nonrival]{.underline}**". Unlike a loaf of bread,
or a machine, [an invention or an equation can be shared by
everyone]{.underline}. If we double the number of workers we have and
double the machines they use, we will merely double their output, which
is the same output per worker. But [if we]{.underline} also [double the
power of technology]{.underline}, [we will **more than double**
output]{.underline}, [making **everyone** richer]{.underline}. [Physical
resources have to be **divided up**]{.underline}, so as the population
grows, the per-capita stock of resources shrinks. [But ideas **do
not**]{.underline}. The per-capita stock of ideas is the total stock of
ideas.

[So we **won't run out** of resources]{.underline}, [as long as we
**keep generating new ideas**]{.underline}. But---[will we run out of
ideas?]{.underline}

Romer assumed that the technology multiplier would grow exponentially at
a rate proportional to the number of researchers. But another economist,
Chad Jones, pointed out that in the 20th century, we have vastly
increased R&D, while growth rates have been flat or even declining. This
is evidence that [ideas have been getting **harder to
find**]{.underline}:

Does this mean inevitable stagnation? [Maybe we have already picked all
the **low-hanging fruit**]{.underline}. [Maybe research is like
**mining** for ideas]{.underline}, [and the vein is **running
thin**]{.underline}. [Maybe inventions are like **fish** in a
pond]{.underline}, and the pond is getting fished out. But notice that
[all these]{.underline} metaphors [treat ideas like **physical
resources**!]{.underline} And I think it's a mistake to call "peak
ideas", just as it's always been a mistake to call peak resources.

One reason, as Paul Romer pointed out, is that [the space of ideas is
**combinatorially vast**]{.underline}. [The number of **potential
molecular compounds**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the number of
possible **[DNA sequences]{.underline}**, [is
**astronomical**]{.underline}. [We have **barely begun** to
explore]{.underline}.

And [even as ideas get **harder to find**]{.underline}, [we get **better
at finding them**]{.underline}. [As the **population** and the
**economy** grow]{.underline}, [we can devote **more brains** and **more
investment** to R&D]{.underline}. [And technologies]{.underline} like
spreadsheets or the Internet [make researchers **more
productive**]{.underline}.
