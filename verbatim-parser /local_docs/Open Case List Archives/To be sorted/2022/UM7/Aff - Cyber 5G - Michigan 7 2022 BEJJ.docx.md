# Aff -- Cyber 5G -- BEJJ

#### What does this Affirmative say?

This affirmative argues that 5G networks are being rapidly deployed in a
manner that lacks adequate cyber security standards. This risks hardware
and software backdoors in 5G networks and equipment as nations purchase
from and contract with untrusted vendors. The first advantage focusses
on Commercial 5G and argues that NATO nations are at risk of cyber
attacks on 5G networks that are unprecedented due to the degree of
connectivity for basic functions and critical infrastructure that 5G
will enable. The second scenario argues that NATO standardization would
help Western nations counter Chinese 5G supremacy which is important in
the tech race as 5G is a critical enabler of emerging and disruptive
technology (many will run on/be dependent on 5G networks). The second
advantage is about NATO military operations that will be conducted on 5G
networks -- most operations from data transfer to military
communications will be conducted over 5G hardware because of benefits to
range and speed. Many cards on both advantages have a 'good 5G good, bad
5G bad' angle that says 5G is inevitable, could solve many problems, or
could introduce new and unprecedented security risks from IP theft and
political coercion, to breaking military operations and communications.

#### Why is NATO key?

'NATO key' is pretty strong for this affirmative. The military advantage
is about NATO so hard to solve that one without NATO -- I suppose many
teams are fiating we delete NATO and saying that's good but the entire
advantage is a defense of NATO and requires interoperability among NATO
members. For the commercial 5G advantage, there's a good argument that
NATO cyber security experts best understand many of the security risks
that 5G introduces for adopters. In truth the EU, ITU, or other
telecommunications agencies could likely set standards for commercial
technology and one weakness is that many of the 5G authors (even those
advocating NATO action) argue that the EU is also important.

#### Why is security cooperation key?

Military integration requires DOD security standards given that the
military will be reliant on 5G security networks.

#### Why is cyber key?

The internal links and solvency advocates are about cyber security of 5G
networks\-\--importantly the solvency mechanism and plan mandates are
about cybersecurity standards only.

[Western nations **vary widely** in their **approach** to the
**security** of **5G networks** and in the basic
assumptions]{.underline} that drive their policy. [This is]{.underline}
clearly [illustrated by]{.underline} the example of [**Huawei**
and]{.underline} other [foreign technology providers being excluded
from]{.underline} the development of 5G in [some Western
nations]{.underline}. While Sweden has excluded the two Chinese
contributors, Huawei and ZTE, from participating in the development of
5G in Sweden (with Huawei filing an appeal against this ban),11 Norway
has decided not to strictly ban the use of 5G equipment. Despite demands
from the Norwegian government in December 2019, Telenor's development of
the 5G network in Bergen, Norway, is mostly based on Huawei sources and
will remain so until 2024, when Telenor will remove untrusted sources
due to security considerations.12 Austria initially decided not to rule
out the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks but stated (under former
chancellor Sebastian Kurz) that it would coordinate its actions with the
EU.13 A more recent statement indicates that 5G may be built with
Chinese contributions in Austria, serving Telekom Austria's 25 million
customers across Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Belarus, Slovenia, Serbia,
and North Macedonia and using Chinese vendors in Bulgaria and North
Macedonia for 4G.14 Belgium initially found no evidence of possible
espionage through the utilization of Huawei's technology and hence
decided not to ban Huawei from contributions to the Belgian 5G network
development.15 However, it was reported that Belgian operators Orange
Belgium and Proximus dropped Huawei as a consequence of US pressure to
exclude Chinese vendors.16 It was later reported that Belgium had
previously experienced a pro-Huawei malign influence campaign.17 Britain
decided to remove Huawei's technology from its telecommunication
networks and demanded its vendors reduce Huawei's share of the network
infrastructure to 35% by 2023.18 [This process]{.underline}, which is
expected to take until 2027, [was **instigated** by the **U**nited
**S**tates, alleging]{.underline} that [Huawei posed a **security
threat** due to its **closeness** to the **Chinese**
government]{.underline}.19 Orange France decided to avoid using Chinese
vendors when developing European 5G networks but envisions Huawei
playing a role in the African 5G rollout.20 If there is a pattern among
Western approaches to 5G security, it appears to be a consensus within
the 'Five Eyes' partnership, and wide variance outside it.21

[Many]{.underline} of the [discussions around]{.underline} whether
[Huawei]{.underline} equipment (or software, as described above) should
be used in 5G networks [centred on the question of]{.underline} whether
[a '**backdoor**']{.underline} existed [in available **equipment**. The
crucial realization]{.underline}, however, [is that the **5G
architecture** does not need 'backdoors' to be built into the system.
The]{.underline} mere [ability to **contribute** to the **5G core**
network **constitutes a backdoor**. The 5G architecture demands
**continuous integration** and **continuous deployment** of **function**
and **software** updates]{.underline}. As [there is currently **no valid
option** to automatically **check code** iterations for]{.underline}
complex **[malicious execution]{.underline}** options, this either must
be monitored by IT professionals or will simply be based on trust in the
contributor. The huge number of code iterations and updates that will
propagate through a multitude of virtualizations makes it unlikely that
this monitoring can be done by humans.

In addition, [the **complexity** of the **architecture** and the
**distributed nature** of its development opens up a still **greater
risk** of **supply chain attacks**. In mid-2020]{.underline}, detection
of the [SolarWinds]{.underline} attack [demonstrated the critical
importance of software **supply chain transparency** and
**integrity**]{.underline} (as well as the power of CI/CD attacks, as
described above).22 [It is equally vital that]{.underline} the
[**construction** of 5G network architecture for **NATO**]{.underline}
member states [is **protected** from hostile state
interference]{.underline} -- but this begs the question of how to
exclude software providers owned by interests within those adversary
states if they are already integrated into the network provision
ecosystem.23

SECTION 3.

Strategic Goals of Adversaries In Networks of NATO Allies

[It is **essential** that any **new technology** that introduces
**critical dependencies** within NATO nations be **adequately secured**
against **threats** from both **non-state** and **state** actors. This
requires a **full** and **regularly updated assessment** of the aims and
approaches to conflict of]{.underline} a wide range of [possible
adversaries. It also requires full and **honest recognition** of the
threat among NATO allies]{.underline} themselves, [and an acceptance
that]{.underline} a state of [notional peacetime does not
mean]{.underline} that [hostilities are not being waged]{.underline} by
any available means.

[The **new vulnerabilities** introduced by the **specific nature** of 5G
networks lend themselves to a]{.underline} wide [range of **unfriendly**
and **overtly hostile actions** by adversaries. As with]{.underline}
other forms of [**information threat**, these span a broad spectrum of
ambition, from simply **causing damage** with no other specific
objective]{.underline} in mind, [to high-level **geostrategic change**
brought]{.underline} about [through indirect means]{.underline}.24
[Non-like-minded nations, including but not limited to **Russia** and
**China**, have closely studied means of **damaging** or **destroying**
the civilian **communications networks** of NATO]{.underline} member
[states, and it should be **anticipated** that this **probing** for
vulnerabilities will **intensify** as relations deteriorate]{.underline}
further. Russian president Vladimir [**Putin** has repeatedly
**promised** responses to Western actions that are unexpected and
'asymmetric']{.underline}.25 To prevent such responses, [NATO
governments should seek to **minimize** their self-inflicted
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}.

[Nevertheless, unless **adequately** secured, **5G** networks **simplify
the task** of the attacker]{.underline} in achieving their aims.
Examples include:

Network destruction and information interdiction. [Adversaries can
achieve effects **remotely** that currently require **physical
intervention** against telecommunications]{.underline} infrastructure.26
This could be [either in support of a localized objective, or a
**widespread attack**]{.underline} in order [to **intimidate** or
**blackmail** victim states into **political concessions**]{.underline}.

Infiltration, espionage, and situational awareness. [The substantial
increase in]{.underline} the number of [**attack surfaces** that must be
**protected** will facilitate attempts at **stealthy penetration** of
networks for]{.underline} the purpose of [long-term **surveillance** and
**data collection**]{.underline}.

Subversion and other sub-threshold attacks. [The nature of
5G]{.underline} networks [will introduce an additional **layer of
deniability** to attacks]{.underline} on communications networks and
connectivity, as attribution becomes more technically, and thus
especially politically, complex.

In addition, [the nature of 5G, as well as]{.underline} other [advanced
technologies' **reliance** on it, presents adversaries with
opportunities for the **innovative exploitation** of vulnerabilities.
**Cyber blackmail** for political coercion is not]{.underline} a
[novel]{.underline} concept, [but it takes on **new
dimensions**]{.underline} thanks to the propagation characteristics of
5G. For demonstrations of the blackmailer's capabilities, destruction of
critical national infrastructure remains a relatively unlikely option,
given the near-consensus that this constitutes an act of war. However,
if such an attack were carried out, isolation measures intended to
protect critical infrastructure would limit its reach. By contrast,
[more **subtle** interventions -- like increasing the latency of the
virtual network functions]{.underline} used for autonomous driving --
[allow less detectable operations but]{.underline}, at the same time,
[could affect much wider areas and spread throughout broad
networks]{.underline}. In other words, [rather than attacking an element
of critical infrastructure]{.underline}, such as a water supplier,
[attacking a **NFV** will hit not just that one **water supplier** but
**any network operator**]{.underline} using the NFV. And depending on
the NFV (or any other software component crucial to the backbone), [this
may **propagate rapidly** and **widely**, including **across borders**
-- like a **domino** at a central junction]{.underline}.

#### New attack vectors expand the [likelihood]{.underline} of and [damage]{.underline} from [cyberattacks]{.underline} on 5G connected infrastructure and devices.

5G Security Considerations

A proper grasp of the new security challenges presented by 5G requires
an understanding of the highly complex technology involved. [5G
networking introduces]{.underline} a number of [**technologies** that
political and strategic **decision-makers** may be **unaware** of but
that are **critical** to understanding]{.underline} the [risks incurred.
These include the **virtualization** of **hardware** components,
**network slicing**]{.underline}, software-defined networking,
[and]{.underline} the [**orchestration** of]{.underline} these [software
components. All]{.underline} of [these introduce **CI/CD**]{.underline}
([continuous integration/continuous deployment]{.underline}) [security
aspects to network backbones]{.underline}, because the essential
software will need to be developed and deployed continuously, opening up
the backbones to CI/CD attack patterns.

[CI/CD security]{.underline} is already an issue today, but
[usually]{.underline} this [only affects software products -- that is, a
**specific program**, not the general backbone(s) of **critical national
infrastructure**. Hence, CI/CD attacks have until now]{.underline} often
[only been relevant to software firms]{.underline} producing high-value
targets, such as operating system developers. But in the same way as
attacks against virtualized environments (considered further below),
[both the **likelihood of attack** and the **profile of attackers** are
likely to change **substantially** due to the **unprecedented** nature
of the 5G environment. An **additional danger** is]{.underline} that
[one attack pattern may]{.underline} be used to [infiltrate the **entire
backbone**; previously]{.underline} it was [only able to attack a
**single** software product. In effect, a **single** CI/CD attack
against a suitable **software component** not only can be **deployed**
against a **wide geographical area** but also, through a partially
autonomous roll-out]{.underline} of updates, [can **easily** and
**rapidly propagate** to a wide **variety of networks**]{.underline}.

As ENISA states in its recent report on the 5G security landscape:5

[One of the most **important innovations** in]{.underline} the
[5G]{.underline} architecture [is the complete virtualisation of the
Core network]{.underline}... These [novel network technologies and
concepts]{.underline} that rely heavily on 'softwarisation' and
virtualisation of network functions [will introduce **new** and
**complex threats**. The core network is the **central part** of the
**5G infrastructure** and enables **all functions**]{.underline} related
to multi-access technologies. Its main purpose is to deliver services
over all kinds of networks (wireless, fixed, converged).

A. Virtualization and Software-Based Architecture

At the core of the development of 5G lies the transition of several
architectural components from previous hardware-based to software
solutions. [This **transition** has allowed the introduction of **new
functionalities** that are **crucial** to meeting the demands that **5G
networks** were developed to address]{.underline}.

Virtualized network functions (VNFs) are used to provide services
through software that replaces dedicated network devices. This shift
from physical devices to software functions allows easier response and
adaptation to environmental conditions (e.g. changes in network traffic
or infrastructure). [As such, they build the **core** of **modern
networks** and are **crucial** to achieving]{.underline} the [**low
latency** and **high speed** of 5G]{.underline} networks which are
currently being deployed. [They build the **new backbone** of our
upcoming **networks**. However, this makes VNFs of particular interest
to **cyber criminals**, **hacktivists**, and **state-sponsored
hackers**, especially as **new attack vectors** are
introduced]{.underline}.

While [virtualization]{.underline} does provide some means of inherent
security, especially against attacks found on the lower end of technical
capabilities, it also [introduces new vulnerabilities, especially
when]{.underline} expecting [**malicious actors** from]{.underline} the
higher end -- [dedicated, state-sponsored IT professionals paid to
**invade** and **infiltrate** target networks. The particular threats
that arise]{.underline} in 5G networks [based on virtualization involve
the possibility of '**cross-contamination**' of shared **hardware
resources**, the introduction of software]{.underline} components [as
basic network functions **lacking integrity**, and in
general]{.underline}, the [attack vectors associated with
virtualization]{.underline} environments (e.g. such as hypervisor
vulnerabilities and virtual machine escape attacks). Currently, it is
anticipated that [5G network security to cope with **virtualization
attacks** needs to be **standardized** and may be **integrated** fully
based on existing solutions. However, the **vast examples** of attack
vectors]{.underline} directed against virtualizations do [make this
approach questionable. Many]{.underline} of these [attack vectors have
been considered]{.underline} rather [theoretical attacks in the past, as
they required **skilled personnel** and **financial resources**. It was
presumed]{.underline} that [**non-state** actors were]{.underline}
rather [unlikely to make such an investment]{.underline}, especially as
valuable targets usually combined virtual and physical security
measures. [This]{.underline} argument [is no longer valid]{.underline},
since we must expect primarily state- and state-sponsored actors to
attack the backbone of 5G networks and can no longer rely on physical
security in 5G.

The fact that attack vectors against virtual environments are --
compared to regular attacks experienced on networks today -- relatively
complex to carry out renders them even more likely to appear on 5G
networks, as the attacker profile is likely to differ from today's
network attackers. This may change over time, but it is reasonable to
expect that 5G networks will initially be a sector for high-skilled
attackers rather than a playground for off-the-shelf exploits and
'script kiddies'.

NFVs (network function virtualizations, a structure used for technical
management and orchestration) are used to manage and orchestrate the
virtualized basic, previously hardware-based, network functions. In
order to do so, [software components need to be addressable (in
**technical** terms) in a **standardized way**]{.underline}. This is
[realized through]{.underline} inter-component interfaces, known as
**[APIs]{.underline}** (application programming interfaces). These APIs
are challenging to design without introducing security vulnerabilities
for a vast variety of technical reasons, whose explanation would exceed
this article's scope but which may be categorized as 'API
vulnerabilities'. Other expected vulnerabilities are account compromise,
unauthorized (privileged) user access, unauthorized inspection or
modification of data, and compromise of management and orchestration
(MANO) components. This may lead to an invasion and subsequent control
over the MANO module of the network and thus unauthorized control over
all communication, functions, and operations performed through this
network.6

Global Challenges -- Twelve **[risks that threaten human
civilisation]{.underline}** -- The case for a new category of risks 89

3.1 Current risks

3.1.5 Global **[System Collapse]{.underline}**

Global system collapse is defined here as either an economic or societal
collapse on the global scale. There is no precise definition of a system
collapse. The term has been used to describe a broad range of bad
economic conditions, ranging from a severe, prolonged depression with
high bankruptcy rates and high unemployment, to a breakdown in normal
commerce caused by hyperinflation, or even an economically-caused sharp
increase in the death rate and perhaps even a decline in population. 310

Often economic collapse is accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and
sometimes a breakdown of law and order. [Societal collapse usually
refers to the fall or disintegration of human societies, often along
with their life support systems. It broadly includes both quite abrupt
societal failures typified by collapses, and more extended gradual
declines of superpowers. Here only the former is included]{.underline}.

3.1.5.1 Expected impact

The world economic and political system is made up of many actors with
many objectives and many links between them. Such intricate,
interconnected systems are subject to unexpected system-wide failures
due to the structure of the network311 -- even if each component of the
network is reliable. This gives rise to systemic risk: [**systemic
risk** occurs when parts that individually may function well become
vulnerable when connected as a system to a **self-reinforcing joint
risk** that can spread from part to part (contagion), potentially
affecting the entire system and possibly spilling over to related
outside systems]{.underline}.312 Such effects have been observed
[in]{.underline} such diverse areas as ecology,313 finance314 and
**[critical infrastructure]{.underline}**315 [(such as power
grids)]{.underline}. They [are characterised by the possibility that a
**small internal or external disruption** could cause a **highly
non-linear effect**]{.underline},316 including a cascading failure that
infects the whole system,317 as in the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

[The possibility of collapse becomes more acute when **several
independent networks depend on each other**, as is **increasingly the
case** (**water** supply, **transport**, **fuel** and **power** stations
are **strongly coupled**, for instance)]{.underline}.318 [This
dependence links social and technological systems as
well]{.underline}.319

[This trend is likely to be intensified by continuing
globalisation]{.underline},320 [while **global governance** and
**regulatory mechanisms** seem **inadequate** to address the
issue]{.underline}.321 This is possibly because the tension between
resilience and efficiency322 can even exacerbate the problem.323

Many triggers could start such [a failure cascade]{.underline}, such as
the infrastructure damage [wrought by]{.underline} a coronal mass
ejection,324 an [ongoing **cyber conflict**]{.underline}, or a milder
form of some of the risks presented in the rest of the paper. Indeed the
main risk factor with global systems collapse is as something which [may
exacerbate some of the other risks in this paper, or as a **trigger**.
But a simple global systems collapse **still poses risks on its
own**]{.underline}. The productivity of [modern societies]{.underline}
is [largely dependent on the careful matching of different types of
capital]{.underline}325 ([social, technological,
natural]{.underline}\...) [with each other. If this matching is
disrupted, this could trigger a "**social collapse" far out of
proportion to the initial disruption**]{.underline}.326 States and
institutions have collapsed in the past for seemingly minor systemic
reasons.327 And [institutional collapses can create **knock-on
effects**, such as the descent of formerly prosperous states to much
more impoverished and **destabilising entities**]{.underline}.328 [Such
processes could trigger damage on a large scale if they weaken global
political and economic systems to such an extent that **secondary
effects** (such as **conflict** or **starvation**) could cause **great
death and suffering**]{.underline}.

3.1.5.2 Probability disaggregation

Five important factors in estimating the probabilities of various
impacts:

> or fragility in other areas.

> 2\. What the true trade-off is between efficiency and resilience.

> 3\. Whether effective regulation and resilience can be developed.

#### Retaliation goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

**Klare '19** \[Michael; November; Professor Emeritus of Peace and World
Security Studies at Hampshire College; Arms Control Association, "Cyber
Battles, Nuclear Outcomes? Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation,"
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation\]

Yet another pathway to [escalation could arise from a **cascading
series** of cyberstrikes and]{.underline} counterstrikes
[against]{.underline} vital national **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
rather than on military targets. All major powers, along with Iran and
North Korea, have developed and deployed cyberweapons designed to
disrupt and destroy major elements of an adversary's key economic
systems, [such as **power grids**]{.underline}, financial systems, [and
**transportation networks**]{.underline}. As noted, Russia has
infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely believed that the
United States has done the same in Russia.12 The Pentagon has also
devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to immobilize the entire
Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to U.S. demands or, if
that approach failed, to pave the way for a crippling air and missile
attack.13

The danger here is that economic [attacks]{.underline} of this sort, if
undertaken during a period of tension and crisis, [could lead to an
**escalating series** of **tit-for-tat attacks** against ever **more
vital elements** of an **adversary's critical infrastructure**,
producing **widespread chaos** and **harm** and]{.underline} eventually
[leading one side to initiate **kinetic attacks**]{.underline} on
critical military targets, [risking the slippery slope to **nuclear
conflict**]{.underline}. For example, a [Russian cyberattack on the U.S.
power grid could trigger U.S. attacks on **Russian energy and financial
systems**, causing **widespread disorder**]{.underline} in both
countries [and]{.underline} generating an impulse for **[even more
devastating attacks]{.underline}**. At some point, such [attacks "could
lead to **major conflict** and **possibly nuclear war**."]{.underline}14

#### Supply chain [attacks]{.underline} cause global war.

Bradley **Martin 21**, Director of the RAND National Security Supply
Chain Institute, and a senior policy researcher RAND Corporation,
"Supply Chain Disruptions: The Risks and Consequences," 11/15/21,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2021/11/supply-chain-disruptions-the-risks-and-consequences.html

By now the impacts of [supply chain disruption are becoming]{.underline}
all too [familiar: **shortages**, **inflation**, **factory closures**,
goods **waiting at ports**]{.underline} to be unloaded. All
[these]{.underline} impacts [are serious enough, but another more-hidden
concern lurks]{.underline} just beneath the surface: [the impact of
**supply chain failure** on **national security**]{.underline}, broadly
defined as [a nation\'s ability to protect]{.underline} and ensure the
well-being of [its population]{.underline}.

This definition of ["national security"]{.underline} is broader than
just the defense industry or military-related efforts; it also [could
encompass the very ability of a nation to ensure **economic
well-being,** **public health**, and **protection** of a nation\'s **key
infrastructure**. Supply chain disruptions cause general **economic
disruption** and key **commodity shortages**, which then in turn
can]{.underline}, in fact, [drive **aggressive national behavior** and
**international instability**]{.underline}. And ironically, this
[reactive aggressive national behavior can happen even if the health of
a national economy itself depends upon continued international economic
interdependence]{.underline}. Indeed, this very [interdependence can
create **vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. So a systematic effort, cutting
across agencies and public and private sectors, could be one way to
ensure these vulnerabilities are understood and mitigated.

Supply Chain Disruption and Conflict

Dispersed supply chains develop because actors find it\'s economically
advantageous to seek the least-expensive and most-productive sources of
supply. These [dispersed chains develop for good reasons, but they
create complicated interdependencies whose **risks** and
**vulnerabilities** are sometimes not even understood,]{.underline} let
alone mitigated.

While the reasons for creating these chains lie largely with private
interest, the effects of disruption---which can come from sources
ranging from malign human action to natural disaster---are rarely
localized. When shortages occur in one industry, [the **disruptions** in
one area **nearly always spill** into adjacent companies and sectors.
Whole economies feel the impact, not isolated actors]{.underline}.

The impact on vulnerable populations may be particularly dire. Supply
chain disruptions do not just create higher prices and shortages among
high-end consumer products, such as cars. They also affect more-basic
commodities such as generic drugs or energy, increasing the cost of
living and the provision of basic needs.

[This kind of disruption can **create instability** more generally,
promoting **conditions for conflict** between and within
nations]{.underline}. For the most part, nations try to maintain access
to markets and resources by peaceful means such as stockpiling, direct
investment in partner nations, and use of other financial incentives.
However, [there is no guarantee]{.underline} that such [competition will
remain peaceful]{.underline}.

As affluent nations and individuals can find ways to mitigate shortages,
they may create blocs of "haves" and "have nots," where some actors have
enough but others cannot meet basic needs. "Haves" may find ways to more
directly change distribution, most likely at the expense of other "have
nots." Or "have" nations may try to forcefully safeguard what they have
gained and work to exclude competitors. In all these cases, the actors
[are **facing shortages**, occasioned by interdependence, and **seeking
security** for themselves in ways that actually promote wider
**international systemic instability**]{.underline}.

Escalation of Conflict

In some cases, [supply chain disruptions can have]{.underline} an even
[more-direct impact than general disruption, causing **shortages of
commodities** the nation **must** have to ensure **national
security**]{.underline}. This kind of disruption can go beyond matters
of justice, equity, and general prosperity to threatening a nation\'s
very ability to defend itself and look after its citizens. Some
[examples are **pharmaceuticals** and personal **protective equipment**,
**energy**, **food**, **raw materials** used in manufacturing, and
**semiconductors** used in]{.underline} multiple different systems
including [military applications. Such shortages can make the need for a
national government to **act more dire** and **immediate** and thus
**raise the risk of conflict**]{.underline}. In some cases, particular
types of raw materials only exist in certain places, so shifting to
more-secure sources isn\'t even possible.

Supply chain disruptions create both leverage for some nations and
reasons for other nations to minimize leverage. For example, Taiwan
currently dominates the market for semiconductors, which in some
respects gives it leverage with other actors, including the mainland
People\'s Republic of China (PRC). Semiconductors are
capital-intensive---a new fabrication facility for semiconductors costs
approximately \$4 billion, with some estimates as high as \$12 billion,
and can take three or more years to build.

This does not even account for the skilled labor, and points to the
difficulty of readily shifting production. As a result, Taiwan gains
considerable leverage over the PRC and indeed the world. However, this
very dominance, plus its proximity to the PRC and its dependence on the
PRC for other commodities, may in fact raise the incentive for the PRC
to take aggressive military action to ensure access to a key commodity.
Such action could range from a "quarantine" to military threats to an
actual invasion.

[Aggressive action may stop]{.underline} well [short of]{.underline}
outright [war, yet still be **very dangerous** for actors]{.underline}
in the system. [The problem of **security vulnerability** overall is
complicated by the **complexity** and **spread** of supply
chains]{.underline} across the world. A nation might not be able to
successfully secure a commodity just by aggressive action against a
single other nation. However, that [action against another
nation]{.underline} certainly [could have the **unintended effect** of
causing supply chains to **fail** in a more general manner.
Aggressiveness]{.underline}, while understandable and probably
predictable, [might therefore also be **extremely dangerous** and
**unproductive**]{.underline}.

Conflict and Instability

[Nations have **gone to war** in the past over **natural resource
shortages** or]{.underline} in an effort [to secure key markets and
labor pools. The need to secure resources and markets was an **explicit
premise** in German and Japanese actions leading to **World War II**.
Such conflict has occurred even during times of **significant
interdependence** between nations, such as]{.underline} in the European
system prior to **[World War I]{.underline}**. Historically, nations
have not yet resorted to war to ensure supply chain security, but it
might be a mistake to assume that such action could never occur when
circumstances become sufficiently dire. Interdependence does create
incentives to cooperate to avoid disruption, but may offer few
alternatives for some desperate nations if some part of the
interdependent chain is broken.

#### Without cyber-secure 5G, NATO risks [tech leadership]{.underline}, failed [smart cities]{.underline} and [IP theft]{.underline}. 5G is key\-\-\--it's the [critical enabler]{.underline} of all emerging systems.

**Jones '20** \[James; 10/1/2020; former commander of U.S. European

These enormous leaps in human capability are poised to transform nearly
every aspect of how we live, work, play, and defend ourselves.
[How]{.underline} these [**innovations** develop, and under **whose**
leadership, will have much to say about the **future balance** of
**economic power** and global **geopolitical influence**]{.underline}
now and in the decades to come.

[At the core]{.underline} of this emerging period of new life-altering
technology- [a **singular technology** pulling it **all together** and
making it possible- is the **next generation** of **wireless**
communications networks]{.underline}- known as **[5G]{.underline}**.

While 4G was evolutionary, the speeds and capacities provided by [5G
networks will be **disruptive** and **revolutionary**]{.underline}...
and not just because they will make our cell phones better and our
Internet connections faster. [5G will be the **central nervous system**
harnessing the **sensors**, **communication links**, **computing
capacity** and **learning** that will]{.underline} make everybody,
[everything]{.underline}, and everyplace [smarter and more
functional]{.underline}.

[The **country** or **group**]{.underline} of countries [that roll out
the network **quickest** and **best** will enjoy a **first mover
advantage** in developing]{.underline} the innovation-related [goods,
services, and solutions. It will]{.underline} also [create a **new
category** of **jobs**]{.underline}. Prosperity enables us to secure
ourselves, fulfill our commitments to our friends and allies, and
advance the nation's interests and values.

[The **great power winner** of this race will have]{.underline} the
[upper hand in setting global **5G norms** and **standards**. Nothing
could be more **consequential** in how the global future takes
shape]{.underline}. By the way, welcome back to a new bipolar world,
this time U.S.- China. Russia is a declining power, and is more of a
strategic nuisance than anything else, with Vladimir Putin to blame.

[Under China's **model**]{.underline} and behavior, [precedent informs
us that 5G capabilities will be employed to **steal intellectual
property**, **monitor** and **control** its population, and]{.underline}
control [as much]{.underline} of the [**global data** as
possible]{.underline}. Conversely, [the **US** and **allied model** for
5G will]{.underline} be a platform to [empower and protect]{.underline}
the **[privacy]{.underline}** of the individual, protect [**intellectual
property**, and]{.underline} safeguard **[national
secrets]{.underline}**, all the while enabling growth and development.

Consider that [China is clearly subsidizing the]{.underline} [sale
of]{.underline} its [5G equipment]{.underline} which enables a pricing
policy that is at least 40% less expensive than ours. [China has the
**strategic goal** of entrenching its **network equipment** into the
systems that **operate** the world's **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}. One can think of it as [the digital belt
and road strategy]{.underline}- and many countries are falling for what
amounts to a very seductive, but ominously dangerous, strategy.

Unfortunately, we have every reason to believe that, among other things,
[China sees the deployment of its 5G equipment as commercial
**intelligence platforms**, **data syphons** and **digital sleeper
cells** sitting at the heart of nation-critical systems]{.underline}
across the globe. [The **digital backdoors** and remote-alterable
software they contain give]{.underline} China [an enormously **powerful
chokehold**]{.underline}- in which 5G can serve as fifth column.

There is good news: [the transition to 5G provides the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, our friends, [and
allies a **golden opportunity** to build **greater cybersecurity** into
our networks]{.underline} by [improving our **supply
chain**]{.underline} practices [and]{.underline} creating [more
**responsible** and enforceable **global norms**]{.underline}.

[Making these improvements is crucial to **protecting** our]{.underline}
qualitative [**military edge**, securing **c**ommand, **c**ontrol and
**c**ommunications networks, achieving **greater interoperability**, and
better **protection** of our **critical infrastructure**]{.underline},
as well as safeguarding personal privacy.

But [unless the transition is not just to 5G but to Secure 5G, the
future will be one of]{.underline} increased [**vulnerability** and
**insecurity**. There will be **no smart cities** without a **secure
network**, and there will be **no protection** of security]{.underline},
intellectual property, or privacy for the individual.

[We are going to enter the **5G world**]{.underline}, of this there is
little doubt. [5G technology is the current]{.underline} generation's
"(1957) [Sputnik moment]{.underline}," a time [when]{.underline} the
[headlines could soon announce]{.underline} that [China has **won the
race**]{.underline} to 5G [over the US and its allies]{.underline}.

#### Chinese-led order [immediately]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline} and [upends]{.underline} liberalism.

**Wang '19** \[Fei-Ling; October 24; Professor at the Sam Nunn School of
International Affairs, Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania; The
Cipher Brief, "The China Order: A Challenge for the U.S. and the World,"
<https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-china-order-a-challenge-for-the-u-s-and-the-world>\]

It is no longer hard to see that [the **rising power**]{.underline} and
the mounting pugnaciousness [of the **P**]{.underline}eople's
**[R]{.underline}**epublic of **[C]{.underline}**hina (PRC) [have become
a]{.underline} comprehensive [**challenge** for the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [China's
**Machiavellian policies**]{.underline} and actions [at home and abroad
have turned a]{.underline}n otherwise naturally complementary
[Sino-American]{.underline} economic [relationship into a]{.underline}
near **[zero-sum]{.underline}**, if not already a zero-sum, [competition
for]{.underline} market, jobs, technology, and financial [**primacy**.
Beijing]{.underline} now [openly **flexes its**]{.underline} new
[**muscles** in its neighborhood]{.underline} and beyond [to
resist]{.underline}, reduce, [and **replace** American
**leadership**]{.underline} and presence [everywhere possible, seeking
to **undermine** the U.S.-led **international**]{.underline} economic
[**order** and American-anchored **collective security**
arrangements]{.underline}. The PRC has been burning billions, for
example, hoping to replace the U.S. dollar with the over-printed Chinese
Renminbi (RMB). Extraordinarily heavy extraction of its own economy, the
world's second largest, and its enormous foreign currency reserve
resulting from the gross imbalance in U.S.-China trade have enabled the
PRC to massively expand its military. That military is already the
world's second largest; its navy, for example, is projected to soon
surpass the U.S. Navy in fleet tonnage. At the same time, massive but
opaque spending sprees has allowed the PRC to actively procure power and
proxies even inside the United States, positioning Beijing to reshape
international opinions and norms more easily than ever.

What is less known, perhaps, is that [the **rising PRC**]{.underline}
state also [seeks an **overhaul** of the **very world order**
that]{.underline} has [enabled the **greatest advances** of human
civilization]{.underline} over the past few centuries -- [the
Westphalian system of **nation-states**]{.underline}. This world order
was codified in the 17th century, expanded to a global scale in the 20th
century, and now is in its post-World War II and post-Cold War iteration
--- [the so-called **America-led L**]{.underline}iberal
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[O]{.underline}**rder (LIO). [The rise
of Chinese power, under the **autocracy** of the
**C**]{.underline}hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty (CCP), [is not just contesting]{.underline} U.S.
national security and [American global leadership but]{.underline} also
[the **existing world order**. Never since the heyday of the Cold War
has the world seen such a **full challenge** to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} to
[the Westphalian system]{.underline}.

[The CCP is leading]{.underline} the PRC [toward]{.underline} a Chinese
Dream of a world order in its own image, which I call [the **China
Order**]{.underline}. The China Order is a millennia-old political
tradition and ideology that mandates [a unitary,
authoritarian]{.underline} (often totalitarian), [omnipotent and
omnipresent government for the **whole**]{.underline} known
**[world]{.underline}**. This alternative world order has had a variety
of euphemisms in the long history of China: from tinaxia yitong
(unification of all under heaven) and shijie datong (world's grand
harmony) in the imperial past, to Mao Zedong's world solidarity for
Communist revolution only forty years ago, to now Xi Jinping's community
of common human destiny. The China Order has powerfully revived to guide
rising PRC power, under the banner of a Chinese version of
globalization, ingeniously taking advantage of the various calls in our
time for [global governance]{.underline} to [address **transnational
issues** such as **climate change**, **inequality**, **epidemics**, and
**terrorism**]{.underline}.

[This China Order is]{.underline} normatively and practically [at
**fundamental odds** with the **LIO**]{.underline} version of the
Westphalia system [that enshrines]{.underline} comparison and
competition among [nations **coexisting** with equal
sovereignty]{.underline}. The China Order has been widely addictive to
the powerful and ambitious in history, whether they have been ethnically
Han or not. It has been highly effective in practice, in great part
because it became deeply legitimized and internalized in elite Chinese
culture over many centuries. The China Order is now the sole acceptable
model of the world under the authoritarianism known as the Qin-Han
polity that the PRC now practices. But under this world order, as
documented by [The China Order]{.underline} (#ad), human civilization
[is socio-economically very **suboptimal** and **hopelessly
stagnant**]{.underline}, inevitably shortchanging the lives of just
about everyone, especially nonelites, as the tragic and often
catastrophic history of Eastern Eurasia under the China Order before the
nineteenth century amply demonstrates.

Since 1949, when the PRC restored traditional Chinese autocracy under
the guise of imported Marxism-Leninism, [the CCP has been
**ceaselessly**]{.underline} and callously [fighting its **own people**
internally and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**American allies**]{.underline} externally [to preserve its monopoly
**over power**. Only **sheer exhaustion**]{.underline} and near collapse
[could force the CCP to **slow down** and **retreat**]{.underline}, at
home and abroad. External powers have influenced and facilitated the
rise of PRC power, but have so far failed to transform the Qin-Han
autocracy and its China Order ideal, thus remaining unable to change
Beijing's world views and global pursuits. Various, often false,
[rationalizations have justified]{.underline} the continuation of
[American]{.underline}/Western [engagement with the PRC,
which]{.underline} has greatly enriched and [**enabled** the CCP to
persist in its **consolidation of power**. Beijing's push for power
is]{.underline} nothing personal; it is [a brand of
authoritarianism]{.underline} just happens to be [**anchored** in
the]{.underline} remarkably persistent [belief that **failing to achieve
control** over the whole]{.underline} known [world would spell the loss
of the "mandate of heaven" and **political extinction**]{.underline}.
Thus, the CCP is driven (or doomed) to methodically and
opportunistically seek ever greater influence.

[The **rise of China**]{.underline}, or more precisely the ever-greater
power of the PRC state, [represents a shift of the
distribution]{.underline} and concentration [of power in the
international system]{.underline} (conceptually known as power
transition) [and an effort to **reorder the units**]{.underline} in the
system [and change the system's **governing norms**. Chinese
leaders]{.underline} have already **[openly claimed]{.underline}** that
[they are]{.underline} now moving to [the center of the world stage,
leading a revolutionary change in]{.underline} the [world order,
**upending** the **Peace of Westphalia**]{.underline} established "four
hundred years ago," in the words of PRC leaders [This points to a
systemic change of world politics]{.underline} and a choice for all of
us at the grandest possible scale: a scale [that could reshape nations
and **redirect the path** of **human civilization**]{.underline}. The
PRC's challenge is therefore greater than the struggle between the two
European ideologies of Capitalism and Communism. [The confrontation
between the **U.S.-led LIO** and the PRC-dreamed **China Order**
transcends]{.underline} these often vaguely defined [civilizational
clashes]{.underline}.

If the PRC challenge, the rise of an unscrupulous, ever more resourceful
and determined PRC state, is not managed well and promptly, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will have to
face]{.underline} a much worse choice in the not too distant future
between tragic capitulation and a [**desperate war** for its national
security and **world leadership**]{.underline} and for the way in which
humankind is organized worldwide. [In the age of]{.underline} many kinds
of **[w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction, this will be a harrowing decision.

Of course, one may argue that the grandiose China Dream of a China Order
may be just another pretentious way for the CCP to invoke traditional,
nationalist, and populist ideals to justify its autocratic governance of
the Chinese people forever, similar to the splendid slogans and missions
fabricated by many other dictators. Perhaps the highly insecure CCP
leadership is fighting for its survival, not world domination. However,
words have consequences. Propaganda and dilution often greatly mesmerize
and mislead the pretenders themselves. More importantly, [the CCP has
been **steadily following**]{.underline} up [its words with
action]{.underline} and money for years (basically nonstop since 1949);
it has just pledged over 10 times the total sum of the Marshall Plan (in
today's dollars) for its Belt and Road Initiative alone, for instance.

As the logic of the China Order dictates, [the rising Chinese power will
**not stop short** of **unseating** the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **reordering the world**,
unless]{.underline} Beijing's Qin-Han polity is transformed and/or
[the]{.underline} ever richer and more [powerful PRC is
checked]{.underline}. The alternatives, [American **capitulation** or
**world war**, are]{.underline} horrific to contemplate, but
[not]{.underline} necessarily [impossible]{.underline}. Unlike in
Hollywood, the "good" guys do not always win necessarily in the real
world. A mighty autocracy that tightly controls one-fifth of humankind,
willfully spends a disproportionately larger portion of the fruits of
the world's second largest economy, and vows (even if only
hypocritically) to reform and reorder the world under its leadership, is
and will always be a mortal challenge to the national security of the
United States. [America's **global position** and]{.underline} way of
life, **[world peace]{.underline}**, and the overall world order [all
rest on how the **PRC challenge** is managed]{.underline}---soon.

#### IP theft undermines [innovation]{.underline} necessary for global [problem solving]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

Without engaging in "chicken and egg" analysis, it is sufficient to
observe that [technological advancement, societal needs, globalization,
**existential threats**]{.underline}, economic realities, [and political
imperatives]{.underline} (or what James Madison referred to in the
Federalist Papers No. 10 as factious governance), [have combined to
create]{.underline} the ["interesting times" for]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates \[[IP]{.underline}\]
intellectual property laws.

What was said by Bobby Kennedy in 1966 remains true today. [We live in
**dangerous** and **uncertain** times. Many of the **existential
threats** remain the same]{.underline} ([**nuclear war** and
**proliferation**]{.underline}, \[**[genocides]{.underline}**\]
genocidal maniacs [and natural **disease**]{.underline}) [and some are
new]{.underline} (\[hu\]manmade disease, greater awareness of
**[environmental changes]{.underline}** and possibly human
interrelationship factors, and the unintended consequences of [**genetic
manipulation** and **robotic technologies**]{.underline}). [The danger
and uncertainty that pervades]{.underline} changes in
**[i]{.underline}**ntellectual **[p]{.underline}**roperty laws, though
not an existential threat of the same manner and kind, [correlates with
the **threat**]{.underline} and remains "more open to the creative
energy of man than any other time in history."

Apropos the creative energy of man, there is a non-coincidental
congruence and convergence of activity across and among the three
branches of government, occurring almost simultaneously with the
congruence and convergence of the rapid developments of technological
innovation across various scientific disciplines and the information
age, reflected in the transformation of the \[IP\] intellectual property
laws in the United States.

Patents

The passage of the AIA was a culmination of efforts spanning several
years of Congressional efforts; and the product of a push by the
companies at the forefront of the twenty-first century new technology
business titans. The legislation brought about monumental changes in the
patent law in the way that patents are procured (first inventor to file
instead of first to invent) and how they are enforced (quasi-judicial
challenges to patent validity through inter-party reviews at the Patent
Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB)).

The 113th and 114th Congress grappled with newly proposed patent law
reforms that, if enacted, may present additional tectonic shifts in the
patent law. Major provisions of the proposals include: fee-shifting
measures (requiring loser pays legal fees - counter to the American
rule); strict detailed pleadings requirements, promulgated without the
traditional Rules Enabling Act procedure, that exceed those of the
Twombly/Iqbal standard applied to all other civil matters in federal
courts, and the different standards applicable to patent claim
interpretation in PTAB proceedings and district court litigation
concerning patent validity.

The Executive and administrative branch has also been active in the
patent law arena. President Obama was a strong supporter of the AIA3 and
in his 2014 State Of The Union Address, essentially stated that, with
respect to the proposed patent law reforms aimed at patent troll issues,
we must innovate rather than litigate.4 Additionally, the USPTO has
embarked upon an energetic overhaul of its operations in terms of patent
quality and PTO performance in granting patents, and the PTAB has
expanded to almost 250 Administrative Law Judges in concert with the AIA
post-grant proceedings' strict timetable requirements.

The Supreme Court, not to be outdone by the Articles I and II branches
of the U.S. government, has raised the profile of patent cases to
historical heights. From 1996 to the 2014-15 term there has been a
steady increase in the number of patent cases decided by the SCOTUS5.
The 2014-15 term occupied almost ten percent of the Court's docket.
Prior to the last two decades, the Supreme Court would rarely include
more than one or two patent cases in a docket that was much larger than
those we have become accustomed to from the Roberts' Court6.

While the SCOTUS activity in patent cases is viewed by some as a
counter-balance to the perceived Federal Circuit's pro-patent and bright
line decisions, it can just as assuredly be viewed as decisions rendered
by a Court of final resort which does not function in a vacuum devoid of
the social, economic and political winds of the times. In recognition of
the effect new technologies have on the patent law, the politicization
of intellectual property law matters, especially patent law (through
factious governing principles of the political branches of the
government), and the maturation of the Federal Circuit patent law
jurisprudence, the SCOTUS has rendered opinions in cases that impact,
and perhaps are/were intended to mitigate the concerns regarding, some
of the vexing issues confronting the patent community today (e.g.,
non-practicing entities or in the politicized parlance "patent trolls,"
the intersection of patent and antitrust laws in Hatch-Waxman so called
"pay-for-delay" settlements between Branded and Generic pharma
companies, and the fundamental tenets that comprise the very heart of
what is patent eligible subject matter).

Copyrights

The advent and ubiquity of the internet, social media and digital
technologies (MP3s, Napster, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter) represents
the impetus for changes in the Copyright laws. The DMCA addressed the
issues presented by these advances or changes in the differing media and
forms of artistic impressions. The proliferation of digital photos,
graphic designs and publishing alternatives, as well as adherence to
globalization harmonization have given rise to changes in the statutory
law and jurisprudence in this area of intellectual property law.
Additionally, there is an overlap of patent rights and copyrights for
software driven by the ebb and flow of the strength of each respective
intellectual property protection.

Notably, the Patent and Copyright Clause7, in addition to Author's
writings, has been viewed as discretely applying to two different types
of creativity or innovation. When drafted the "sciences" referred not
only to fields of modern scienctific inquiry but rather to all
knowledge. And the "useful arts" does not refer to artistic endeavors,
but rather to the work of artisans or people skilled in a manufacturing
craft. Rather than result in ambiguity or confusion, perhaps the Framers
were either quite prescient or, just coincidentally, these aspects of
the Patent and Copyright Clause have converged.

For example, none other than the famous Crooner, Bing Crosby, benefited
from both protections. Well-known as a prolific and popular recording
artist he also benefited from his investments in the, then innovative,
recording technologies. Similarly, the Beatles, Beach Boys, as well as
many other rock and roll artists, experimental efforts in music
performance, recording and production, helped to transform the music
industry in both copyrightable artistic expression and patentable
inventions. Similarly, film, literary and digital arts reap benefits at
the crossroads of both copyright and patent protections.

Trademarks

Trademark laws have been impacted by numerous changes in the business
landscape. They include the internet, Domain names, international rights
in a global economy, different venues and avenues for branding,
marketing and merchandising, global knock-offs from nations that have a
less than stellar respect for intellectual property rights, and
international trade agreements. More recently, politicization (or
perhaps political correctness) has creeped into the trademark law arena
pitting branding rights and protections against first amendment rights.

Trade Secrets

As with Copyright and Trademark law, trade secrets law includes some of
the same issues related to trade agreements. TRIPS required members to
have trade secret protection in place. Initially, the United States
compliance with this requirement has relied upon the trade secret law of
the individual states. That compliance may be supplanted by the recently
enacted DTSA. Similarly, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade
agreement contains intellectual property rights provisions that will
trigger required changes to United States statutory Intellectual
Property Laws.

The proposed trade secret legislation also gives rise to several
concerns. For instance, there is an absence of a specific definition for
trade secret, as well as potential issues of federalism, conflict with
state law precedent (despite no preemption), remedies, and the impact on
employer/employee relations.

There is also a real concern that the strengthening of trade secret
protection in conjunction with the perceived weakening of patent
protection (e.g., high rate of invalidating patents in post-grant
proceedings before the PTAB and strict limitations on what is patent
eligible subject matter) may very-well have the unintended consequence
of contravening the purpose behind the Patent and Copyright Clause: "to
promote the progress of the sciences and the useful arts." Moreover, the
incentive to innovate may very well be usurped by the advantage of
withholding patent law disclosure of highly beneficial scientific
advancements that directly affect the human condition, alter life
expectancies and the evolution of the human species (rather than by mere
"natural selection"), and what is the very essence of a human being (for
better or worse). Thus, crippling innovation and the progress of the
sciences and useful arts.

Privacy Rights

It is increasingly more difficult to function "off the grid." The
invasive and non-invasive attributes of the internet, the reliance upon
the multitude of devices, social media, and information age
technologies, and access to big data, all contribute to the decrease in
and dilution of the right to privacy. Wittingly or otherwise, the strong
libertarian roots of the republic have been replaced by dependence upon
these modes of an information-age life. Commentary on the benefits and
deficits of this reality are beyond the subject and purpose of this
writing. Suffice to acknowledge that the right to privacy has been
significantly reduced. The laws that protect these rights are in a
constant struggle to maintain those rights while yielding to the demands
of the lifestyle and security concerns. Laws that relate to
cybersecurity in the global and domestic space create interplay with
privacy rights. Legislation, trade agreements and jurisprudence all
impact this area of intellectual property. Cross-border theft of trade
secrets, competitor espionage, and loss of control over personal data
are all implicated in the intellectual property law arena.

America's Need For Strong Intellectual Property Protection

[The need for **strong** protection of **i**ntellectual **p**roperty
**r**ights is greater now than]{.underline} it was [at the dawn of our
republic]{.underline}. Our Forefathers and the Framers of the U.S.
Constitution recognized the need to secure those rights in Article 1,
Section 8, Clause 8. James Madison provides insight for its significance
in the Federalist Papers No. 43 (the only reference to the clause). It
is contained in the first Article section dedicated to the enumerated
powers of Congress. The clause recognizes the need for: uniformity of
the protection of IP rights, securing those rights for the individual
rather than the state; and, incentivizing innovation and creative
aspirations.

Underlying this particular enumerated power of Congress is the same
struggle that the Framers grappled with throughout the document for the
new republic: how to promote a unified republic while protecting
individual liberty. The fear of tyranny and protection of the "natural
law" individual liberty is a driving theme for the Constitution and
throughout the Federalist Papers. For example, in Federalist No. 10,
James Madison articulated the important recognition of the "faction"
impact on a democracy and a republic. In Federalist No. 51, Madison
emphasized the importance of the separation of powers among the three
branches of the republic. And in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton,
provided his most significant essay, which described the judiciary as
the weakest branch of government and sought the protection of its
independence providing the underpinnings for judicial review as
recognized thereafter in Marbury v. Madison.

All of these related themes are relevant to the Patent and Copyright
Clause and at the center of the intellectual property protections then
and now. The Federalist Papers No. 10 recognition that a faction may
influence the law has been playing itself out in the halls of congress
in the period of time leading up to the AIA and in connection with the
current patent law reform debate. [The large **tech companies** of the
past, **new tech**, new patent-based financial **business model
entities**, and **pharma** factions have been the drivers, proponents
and opponents of certain of these efforts]{.underline}. To be sure, some
change is inevitable, and both beneficial and necessary in an
environment of rapidly changing technology where the law needs to evolve
or conform to new realities. However, changes not premised upon the
founding principles of the Constitution and the Patent and Copyright
Clause (i.e., uniformity, secured rights for the individual,
incentivizing innovation and protecting individual liberty) run afoul of
the intended purpose of the constitutional guarantee.

Although the Sovereign does not benefit directly from the fruits of the
innovator, enacting laws that empower the King, and enables the King to
remain so, has the same effect as deprivation and diminishment of the
individual's rights and effectively confiscates them from him/her.
Specifically, with respect to intellectual property rights, effecting
change to the laws that do not adhere to these underlying principles, in
favor of the faction that lobbies the most and the best in the quid pro
quo of political gain to the governing body threatens to undermine the
individual's intellectual property rights and hinder the greatest
economic driver and source of prosperity in the country.

[It is also important to recognize that the social, political and
economic impact of **strong protections** for intellectual property
**cannot be overstated**]{.underline}. In the social context, [the
**incentive** for **disclosure** and **innovation** is critical.
Solutions for **sustainability** and **climate change**]{.underline}
(whether natural, man-made or mutually/marginally intertwined) [rely
upon this premise]{.underline}. Likewise, as [we are on the precipice of
the **ultimate convergence in technologies** from the hi-tech **digital
world** and **life sciences** space, capturing the ability to cure many
**diseases** and **fatal illnesses** and providing the true promise of
extended longevity]{.underline} in good health and well-being, that is
meaningful, productive, and purposeful; [this incentive must be
preserved]{.underline}.

In similar fashion, [advancements in **technologies** related to the
global economy and communications will enhance the **possibilities for
solutions** to political and cultural **conflicts** that arise around
the globe]{.underline}. Likewise, [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} economy [has always benefited when it is at the
**forefront of innovation** and achieves **prosperity** from its
**leadership role** in technological advancements.]{.underline}

Conclusion

As was the case in 1966, how we move forward today, [to solve the many
problems facing]{.underline} our country and [the broader global
community]{.underline} in these "interesting times," both within and
without the laws affecting intellectual property rights, [depends
upon]{.underline} the "[creative energy]{.underline} of man" [which must
prevail. An **achievable** goal, dependent on the **strong**, **stable**
and **sound protection** of **i**ntellectual **p**roperty]{.underline}
rights.

#### Cyber risks to smart cities are [existential]{.underline} but securing them [solves]{.underline}.

Robert **Muggah 21**, principal at the SecDev Group and co-founder of
the Igarape Institute; and Greg Walton, fellow at the SecDev Group and a
researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, 4/17/2021, \"'Smart' Cities
Are Surveilled Cities,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/17/smart-cities-surveillance-privacy-digital-threats-internet-of-things-5g/>,
RMax

But a narrow preoccupation with surveillance technologies, as
disconcerting as they are, underestimates the [threats on the **near
horizon**. Smart cities are]{.underline} themselves [a potential
**liability**]{.underline}---for entirely different reasons. This is
because [many of them are approaching the precipice of a
**hyperconnected** "internet of everything," which comes with
**unprecedented levels of risk** tied to **billions** of **unsecured
devices**]{.underline}. These don't just include real-time surveillance
devices, such as satellites, drones, and closed-circuit cameras. [By
2025, there could be over 75 billion connected devices around the
world]{.underline}, many of them [lacking even the most **rudimentary
security features**]{.underline}. As cities become ever more connected,
[the risks of digital harm by malign actors grow
**exponentially**]{.underline}. Cities are therefore entirely unprepared
for the coming digital revolution.

One of the paradoxes of a hyperconnected world is that [the **smarter**
a **city** gets, the more exposed it becomes to a widening array of
**digital threats**]{.underline}. Already, [large, medium, and small
cities are being targeted for **data theft**, **system breaches**, and
**cyberattacks**, all of which can undermine their **operation** and
**provision** of **essential services**, and pose an **existential
threat**]{.underline}. Hundreds of [cities]{.underline} around the world
[have reported major digital disruptions to municipal websites,
emergency call centers, health systems, and utilities delivering power
or water]{.underline}. When city security is compromised and data
privacy jeopardized, it undermines the faith of residents in digitally
connected services and systems. As people feel more insecure, they may
feel less inclined to participate in online health care, digitized
utilities, remote learning opportunities, electronic banking services,
or green initiatives---key tenets of the smart city. While not all
digital threats can be countered, [cities need to mount a **robust
capability** to deter]{.underline}, respond to, [and recover from
attacks while preserving, as best they can, data protection and
privacy]{.underline}.

#### Coordination within NATO secures [5G supremacy]{.underline} and ensures [global cooperation]{.underline} towards secure 5G.

What is 5G?

Magnifying the proficiency of modern-day technology is the
fifth-generation cellular wireless network, 5G. Like the preceding
generation launches of mobile networks, [5G enables **numerous
capabilities**]{.underline} [through greater capacity,]{.underline}
shorter wavelengths, worldwide mobile internet connections, and
high-frequency bandwidths \[1\]. [As part of **telecommunication
networks**, 5G technology expands the productivity of correspondence
between machines without human assistance]{.underline} \[2\]. [Such
improvement grants 5G as the **foundation** for advancements in
autonomous cars, smart roads, Augmented Reality]{.underline}
(**[AR]{.underline}**), [intelligent healthcare and medicine, and
semi-autonomous robots]{.underline} for everyday use \[3\].

In detail, there are three cross-cutting components to the essence of
5G. These are increased efficiency, multipath ways, and swift signal
delivery across the 5G spectrum for core network functions \[4\]. What
is significant is that the framework is software-based, and any
adjustments can be made through a simple software update or replacement,
if necessary \[5\]. Certainly, abilities such as that of 5G are costly
to implement, which brings both possibilities and complications to the
idea of network sharing to decrease expenses.

Nonetheless, the incorporation of 5G into modern and future technologies
is making momentous progress in both individual and company life. This
kind of technology will be significantly impactful for consumers in
areas such as retail, entertainment, automotive production, the
manufacturing industry, and logistical processes \[6\]. Likewise, it
will have an incredible stake in government and national security. 5G is
already integral in ongoing technological advancements and security
strategies for actors in the global political economy.

Technology and Geopolitical Relations: Will the bifurcation of the
technology world posit better relations?

Along with 5G, other technological developments such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), robotics, and nanotechnology are powerful tools of
influence in economic and trade interests. [Many **scholars** and
**scientists** claim that this **new technology** is changing the
**geopolitical landscape**]{.underline} \[7\]. There is already a gap
between developed and developing countries in obtaining new technologies
\[8\]. Should the unequal access in the digital world continue,
developing countries are bound to keep further behind which can
ultimately stifle progress to development.

[At the forefront of technology and **geopolitics concerns**
is]{.underline} the anomaly [that new technology is bringing about
profound social change in data localization]{.underline} \[9\].
[Significantly, it is **altering** the **distribution of power**,
broadly in western **democratic** and **authoritarian**
regimes]{.underline} \[10\]. Thus far, in democracies, there has been an
increase in power at the individual citizen level and a decrease in
state power \[11\]. On the contrary, [authoritarian regimes are
experiencing an **increase in state power** and a decreased power of
citizens]{.underline} \[12\]. As the ambiguity of experiencing different
trends persist, [it becomes prudent to ask oneself how this may affect
future **trade relations**, **tensions** in the global **technological
competition**, and success in adopting **policies** and **standards**
worldwide]{.underline}.

China in the 5G Equation

China boasts a competitive advantage over foreign markets as it has
accumulated expertise and experience since the introduction of 5G
networks. Due to high levels of industrialization, low costs of
production, and domestic and foreign market supply and demand, the
maturity and sophistication of Chinese companies have dubbed it as the
leader in the global race to obtain and develop 5G technology \[13\].

The Chinese company [Huawei]{.underline} has [emerged as a
**powerhouse** in the world's **telecommunications
infrastructure**]{.underline} \[14\]. Part of the concerns about China's
rising influence is due to its capacity to present weaknesses through
software updates and the ability to use competitive prices to insert
itself into the fundamentals of capitalistic democratic societies
\[15\]. [Seeing that the Chinese government does not encourage a free
market but rather **exerts control** over its companies, this poses a
great **cybersecurity threat** to states' **national security** as
sensitive information that can be accessed from the simplest online
interaction by China]{.underline}. To date, both the United States and
the United Kingdom have banned Huawei from their networks due to
concerns of security. A rise in leadership from a Western alternative in
opposition to Huawei has been a challenge because Huawei and ZTE, both
China-based companies, were major suppliers of 4G networks.

In an attempt to further increase its influence through the digital
markets, [China has launched the Digital Silk Road]{.underline}
(**[DSR]{.underline}**) [which is a very integral part of the overall
Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline} (**[BRI]{.underline}**) [strategy.
An **essential component** of the DSR strategy is to finance other
countries' telecommunications infrastructures]{.underline}. This is one
of the main ways that Chinese firms have built their 5G network and
technology standards in other countries, therefore [posing the risk of
**potential espionage** and involvement in internal state **legislative
issues**]{.underline} \[16\]. Nonetheless, recipient countries of
China's 5G firms have attained a greater aptitude to filter and moderate
content, localize data and surveil the digital world \[17\].

NATO: 5G's challenges and opportunities

China's digital footprint in 5G brings the potential of future military
development into perspective. [China is known to have **aggressive
tensions** with]{.underline} the **[NATO]{.underline}** Alliance
members, [therefore sparking a need for **more cohesion**. Since the
development of 5G, NATO and]{.underline} its [allies have not been
playing major roles in the newest telecommunications
software]{.underline}. To best comprehend [NATO]{.underline} and how it
[can **obtain** and **develop** 5G for a **secure**, responsible
**global** environment]{.underline}, it is best to analyze 5G in three
essential ways.

Firstly, 5G needs to be seen as an area for development. Any
introduction of new technology allows for discussion which can better
help allies to comprehend the complexities and need for policies for
technological transitions \[18\]. Increasing economic growth through
such technology also results in the need to execute command and control,
manage communications, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing
behind the scenes and on the battlefield \[19\]. Doing so will not only
allow for room for development but will overall enhance the quality of
military equipment needed to achieve NATO goals.

Moreover, a second way that [5G needs to be]{.underline} viewed is as an
ecosystem that needs to be [protected]{.underline}. Being a
telecommunications network that is a hyper interconnective system, it is
something that private and government sectors struggle to find a common
ground on for its operations and policies \[20\]. [If not protected in
both playing fields, next-generation telecommunications will run into a
**vast array of problems** and **security insecurities**. In addition,
because 5G operates on **machine-to-machine** communication, the
perimeter **cyber defense** is ineffective]{.underline} \[21\]. [As
risks of **cyber-attacks** grow, NATO needs to ensure that]{.underline}
their [5G development efforts take into **consideration** that
integrating **equipment** from Chinese firms widens and deepens serious
questions of **trust** and **reliability**]{.underline} for military
functions \[22\]. Consequently, [if the 5G ecosystem is not protected,
then serious **political ramifications** can occur]{.underline} as a
result. Aforementioned, the value of privacy is different in China than
it is in western democracies. Chinese government's direct access to its
firms poses advantages to the Chinese intelligence community which, in
turn, will prompt countries to reconsider their methods in storing big
data \[23\]. Being at odds with a country due to differences in privacy
laws, democratic values and ethics are very important because they can
potentially constrain relations.

[Because of the world's **interdependence** on 5G networks, it poses a
**suitable avenue** for **collaboration** amongst NATO allies and with
countries **outside** the **transatlantic alliance**. The world of
telecommunications takes on the concept that "the early bird gets the
worm." Demonstrated in China's leadership of 5G development, most state
actors still have a **strong motivation** to merge into the **race** and
assume a position that could **amplify their economy**]{.underline}
\[24\]. It should be understood that [telecommunication is **truly
strategic** in nature. Working **together** to ensure **speed** and the
**quality** and **quantity** of information is a multifaceted avenue for
the **Alliance**, its **allies**, and **non-members** to engage in
**healthy global cooperation**]{.underline}.

### Military 5G\-\--1AC

#### Advantage 2 is Military 5G.

#### Military 5G deployment is [inevitable]{.underline} but compromised by lack of [cybersecurity]{.underline} and [interoperability]{.underline}.

Emma **Helfrich 21**, technology editor at Military Embedded Systems;
quoting Lance Spencer, client executive vice president for defense at
AT&T Public Sector and FirstNet; Craig Miller, president of ViaSat
Government Systems; and John Cowles, director of engineering and
technology at Analog Devices, 10/19/2021, \"5G and the military: A new
era of connectivity,\" No Publication,

RMax

Fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, is poised to emerge in a
big way into the defense market. While the buzz surrounding the 5G
technology standard has been growing in the general public in recent
years, [the]{.underline} U.S. Department of Defense [**(DoD)** has been
**trailing** behind]{.underline} commercial entities [on **adopting
5G**]{.underline} due in part to both the slower pace of the DoD's
acquisition process and the hard-to-keep-up-with pace of
consumer-technology refresh. However, [officials at]{.underline} several
[defense communications companies agree]{.underline} that [it's **just a
matter of time** before **5G-enabled military solutions** are
**deployed** and **forever change** the way]{.underline} in which the
[armed forces **communicate**]{.underline}.

That fact that 5G is a largely commercially developed solution that is
now on track for adaptation to military use has enabled defense
electronics manufacturers to operate in collaborative environments. This
reality will prove to be valuable, as one of the driving factors behind
widespread 5G adoption in the military is not the advent of the waveform
itself, but the set of network-management standards that will follow.

**[Multidomain operations]{.underline}**, as seen in military programs
[such as]{.underline} Joint All Domain Command and Control [(JADC2),
could greatly benefit from]{.underline} the
**[interoperability]{.underline}** [enabled through 5G use]{.underline}.
One way is through 5G technology's ability to bring disparate solutions
together under a unified network management system.

With 5G adoption occurring all around the world, [electronic warfare
(EW) and spectrum-management applications could]{.underline} also [see
an evolution following the implementation of 5G
architectures]{.underline}. The use of [5G]{.underline} and its
[incorporation into]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance [**(ISR) systems** could]{.underline} indelibly [alter
how the military gathers **actionable intelligence**, ranging from how
the DoD detects/is detected to further opening vast avenues of data
collection.]{.underline}

The transition from Long Term Evolution 4G (4G LTE) to standalone 5G
deployment will be gradual, just as it was from the early days of 1G
(launched in Japan in 1979, adopted in 1983 in the U.S.) all the way to
December 1, 2018, when South Korea became the first country to offer 5G.
The process will take even longer to reach the military, with networking
standards, current DoD networking architectures, and measured
acquisition timelines among the current hurdles bogging down immediate
fielding.

The difference between 4G and 5G

Following the introduction and implementation of 4G LTE in consumer and
military markets, the unprecedented streaming ability that it offered
was regarded as revolutionary. While patchiness in the 4G LTE network
did leave users in certain regions unsatisfied, it's a fact that 5G was
already in the planning stages.

"5G, as it actually came to be, was thought of as more than just a
generational change in how we communicate through a cellular environment
with cell phones. It was actually pretty far-reaching in its genesis,"
says John Cowles, director of engineering and technology at Analog
Devices (Wilmington, Massachusetts). "It's more than a comms system, as
it enables a system of different systems. What I mean by that is there's
a traditional cellphone system, but 5G also envisions how that might
affect IoT \[Internet of Things\], or even satellite communications.
There's terrestrial communication, there's people, there's data, there's
IoT, and then there's the satellite piece of it."

Often referred to by industry professionals as the IoT era, 5G dawned
amid the understanding that data was being created far more quickly and
in volumes greater than what current networks could handle. The vast
quantities of unstructured sensor data and the military's need to make
sense of it also produces processing challenges that 5G could likely
handle.

"[5G offers **faster download speeds**, **lower latency**, and **more
capacity** and **connectivity** for millions of devices and the
possibilities for **massive innovation**]{.underline}," says Lance
Spencer, client executive vice president for defense, AT&T Public Sector
and FirstNet (Oakton, Virginia). "5G's ultra-low latency means faster
response times when moving data like video and AR/VR \[augmented
reality/virtual reality\] for immersive experiences. [Its **high
reliability** makes it **ideal** for supporting **mission-­critical
applications** and **services**. Its massive connectivity capabilities
enable faster aggregation of **network-connected endpoints**,
**sensors**, **devices**, and **data** to power **IoT
connectivity**]{.underline}."

The all-encompassing nature of [5G is]{.underline} precisely what makes
it such [an **attractive solution** for the **military**]{.underline}.
In areas where past network generations have had to go it alone, 5G and
its proponents claim that few systems, waveforms, and data links would
go unsupported under a 5G architecture.

"[When people talk about 5G]{.underline}, a lot of times [they think
about]{.underline} the waveform that [the]{.underline} cell carriers are
bringing to **[market]{.underline}**," says Craig Miller, president of
Viasat Government Systems (Carlsbad, California). "And yes, that is part
of a 5G. It is a specific waveform in a way that radios communicate with
each other, **[but]{.underline}** the [5G standard and the set of 5G
standards are **much more than that**]{.underline}. And I think that's
one of the things [that sets 5G **apart** from 4G]{.underline} -- [the
extensibility to create a 5G network-management infrastructure that can
use **additional waveforms**]{.underline}."

It's notable that [**a network designed** to be as impartial as 5G
could]{.underline} actually [be **pivotal** in **multidomain
operations** and the act of bringing disparate systems **together** for
the **military**. The added benefit of doing so under a **simplified
network-management system** is something that 5G could **excel
at**]{.underline} in comparison to 4G LTE. [This would mean **true
interoperability** under **5G** for the **DoD**]{.underline}.

5G and how the military interoperates

"There's sort of a historical precedent for this," Miller says. "[If you
look at]{.underline} how **[successful interoperability]{.underline}**
has been [achieved in the past, it's]{.underline} usually [by doing it
at the **­network level**]{.underline} or sometimes the application
level. But [the internet is an example of doing it]{.underline} at the
network level [where]{.underline} you have a TCP/IP (internet protocol
suite) network and [a bunch of different networks]{.underline} that
[aren't]{.underline} even [always **compatible**]{.underline}. But [you
do have]{.underline} the [**networking standards** that allow them to
**interoperate** through]{.underline} either the [management
or]{.underline} the [gateway functions]{.underline}, and **[5G can do
this]{.underline}**. It's really a way that [you can]{.underline}
\[capture\] these disparate networks -- those that would have been
stovepiped in the past -- and then [use a 5G network-management
architecture to **bring them together**]{.underline}."

An important DoD program powered by the modern-day need for cross-domain
solutions in the military is JADC2: The robust sensor connectivity that
JADC2 was introduced to achieve could be successful under the
implementation of a widely compatible 5G-powered network.

"Joint All-Domain Command and Control is key to enabling multi-domain
operations," AT&T/FirstNet's Spencer says. "JADC2 and global operations,
including space-based 5G terrestrial networks, will require the
elimination of silos to ensure seamless communications between nodes.
[For the **military**, 5G technologies allow for the operation of
several]{.underline} potential [applications to include
**C2**]{.underline} \[command and control\], [**logistics**,
maintenance, training, **AI**]{.underline} \[artificial intelligence\],
[augmented and virtual reality, and **ISR systems**]{.underline} -- [all
of which]{.underline} can [benefit from **improved data speeds** and
**lower latency**]{.underline}."

[Fielding a network as]{.underline} extensible, indiscriminate, and
[**interoperable** as **5G**]{.underline}, however, [will present
**security concerns**]{.underline}, especially in multidomain defense
arenas. Officials claim that [the **security question** will influence
how 5G networks]{.underline} and 5G network management systems [are
**architected**]{.underline}.

"[As you bring **more users together**, there are more paths
to]{.underline} give to [any **individual user**. Being able to
**understand** the **data** and **metadata** on your network and create
a **cyberdefense**]{.underline} around that is one thing we've put a lot
of time and energy into in the past decade," Miller says. "This [will be
**really important** on **5G networks**]{.underline}, especially in the
JADC2 construct [as you bring]{.underline} these [networks together
because you're going to have to move beyond **cyber hygiene** and
checklist-based and boundary-based cyberdefense and]{.underline} instead
[move to behavioral analysis and watching how
users interact]{.underline}."

[Designing these **security** and **signals-intelligence capabilities**
into 5G]{.underline}-powered [architectures will]{.underline} also
[be]{.underline} an [**important** part of the role 5G will play in **EW
theaters**]{.underline}. The reason: [While]{.underline} the
[5G]{.underline} waveform [isn't]{.underline} specifically [designed to
work in contested environments, its **scalability** makes it **ideal**
for **congested spots**]{.underline}.

Electronic warfare and 5G

[**Officials are excited** about the possibility of **5G**]{.underline}
network-management [systems]{.underline} designed [to support various
**protected waveforms** and thought to be **ideal** for **EW
environments**. Pairing a native 5G network with supported
waveforms]{.underline} that are [built for low probability of detection
could **enable warfighters** to **roam between available
networks**]{.underline}, depending on the mission (Figure 1).

\[Figure 1 omitted\]

"The part of [the 5G]{.underline} spec and [waveform]{.underline} that's
[operating in the **millimeter band**]{.underline} -- those very high
frequencies that tend to not propagate as far -- [create]{.underline}
some [capabilities that are]{.underline} a little [more interesting in
terms of the EW environment]{.underline}," Miller says. "This is because
[it's **harder** for the **adversary** to see them]{.underline}, simply
[because they don't propagate as far]{.underline}. So, [these little
bubbles of operation are more difficult for adversaries to **reach
into**]{.underline}. And [a hybrid networking case where you have a 5G
network with]{.underline} different physical [layer
waveforms]{.underline}, that also [gives you room to play in an EW
environment]{.underline}."

Moreover, [5G could]{.underline} also [fare **well** in EW arenas
because it's designed with the inherent ability to listen **only** to
what it **needs to**, avoiding disruption from]{.underline} both
[**accidental** and purposeful signals that]{.underline} may [get in the
way]{.underline}. Even so, [in the instance]{.underline} that
[disruption on the **electromagnetic spectrum**]{.underline} did occur,
[corresponding **5G-powered technologies** could aid in identifying
it]{.underline}.

"[If an adversary is using 5G]{.underline} technology in the area, then
[**EW systems** will need to be able to understand if there's
5G]{.underline} communication [because this tech]{.underline}nology [is
not just owned by the U.S.]{.underline}," Cowles says. "It's worldwide,
so [adversaries could very well use 5G to communicate]{.underline} as
well. [EW systems will need to start being engineered to identify 5G
signals and understand what adversaries could potentially be trying to
communicate]{.underline}. That's one side of it, and the other would be
the fact that we use 5G technology and we don't want unwelcome users to
be able to disrupt or see what we're doing. That's where EW and 5G
technology environments will have to coexist."

Data collection and interpretation are so important to EW and are major
pieces of the advantage 5G could provide on the battlefield. [With
the]{.underline} seemingly [insurmountable quantities of data brought in
by]{.underline} both [military]{.underline} and commercial [sensors,
**5G-powered computing** could better enable **processing
capabilities**]{.underline}.

"[5G allows for multiaccess edge computing]{.underline} (MEC), [where
data is processed locally]{.underline} near a device [to speed the
completion of computing]{.underline} tasks," Spencer says. "[MEC allows
users to aggregate **mission-critical data**]{.underline} on site [and
offers]{.underline} the [flexibility of delivering cloud
services]{.underline} closer to the edge with localized compute
functionality and optimized 5G cloud services. 5G networks are designed
with robust, integrated cybersecurity protections to help secure user
data."

While [edge computing]{.underline} is undoubtedly a start when it comes
to military data analysis, there is still [far too much of it for
**humans alone** to process]{.underline}. Whether it's anomalous network
behavior, signals on the spectrum, or information from the cloud,
[automated 5G network-­management systems]{.underline} powered by AI
[could be **pivotal** in rendering out **actionable
details**]{.underline}.

Pairing 5G with AI

"[5G technologies could]{.underline} also [be incorporated into **ISR
systems**]{.underline}," Spencer says. "[These require increasingly high
bandwidth to process]{.underline}, exploit, [and disseminate
intelligence data]{.underline} from a network of terrestrial and
airborne sensors. [This could **enhance C2** by providing commanders
with timely access to **key intelligence** and **actionable
information** that can improve decision making in **split seconds** and
allow commanders a **better understanding** of an **adversary's decision
cycle**]{.underline}." (Figure 2.)

\[Figure 2 omitted\]

The [faster]{.underline} and more efficient [transmission of
data]{.underline} that [5G could enable would]{.underline} thereby
[allow **AI-powered analysis** engines to run **more
effectively**]{.underline}. Because AI and machine learning (ML)
algorithms must be trained, [enhanced **low-latency access** to data
could result in **smarter AI**]{.underline}/ML [systems]{.underline}.

"[What 5G does bring is]{.underline} this somewhat [open architecture
where you can plug all kinds of different things in that could allow you
to plug in different networks at the right level and offer the ability
to command and control using the 5G network]{.underline}," Cowles says.
"Historically, with all of the different sensors and systems out there,
[it's been very difficult to get actionable]{.underline}, multisensor
[data from all]{.underline} of [the different deployed
technologies]{.underline} to give you a cohesive, one-point location for
that information. [**5G** makes that **more likely** because it can plug
into **different systems**, assuming the **necessary security** is
there]{.underline}."

The evidence is stacking up: [5G]{.underline} is a network that [is not
only supportive of high data-throughput systems like]{.underline} that
of **[AI]{.underline}**/ML, but [it also enables the maximization
of]{.underline} such [capabilities all the same]{.underline}. Apparent
in the excitement surrounding 5G's implementation is the evidence that
players in the network-communications realm appear to be that much
closer to tackling the big data problem faced by the military.

"[We've only seen the **tip of the iceberg** in terms of what **5G** can
do]{.underline}," Cowles says. "[5G has such **enormous potential** and
there are **so many layers** to it we **haven't even seen unlocked
yet**, and we'll continue to see that AI will have a bigger role as
**5G** reaches its **full potential**]{.underline}."

5G Impact on DoD

While much of the discussion around 5G revolves around the commercial
sector as the driving force behind its rollout, **[5G
ecosystems]{.underline}** of technology [can]{.underline} equally
[**revolutionize** DoD operations, networks, and information processes.
DoD must be able to communicate]{.underline}, engage, [and operate
**faster** to keep up with the changing environment. 5G will enable this
new concept of operations, allowing larger volumes of data to be shared
in]{.underline} close to [real time across geographically dispersed
systems]{.underline}. Currently, [data sharing]{.underline} at that
scale [cannot be completed effectively with legacy]{.underline}
communication [networks]{.underline}. Existing networks will benefit by
leveraging lower latency and higher capacity data transfer capability,
but [**5G's true potential** will be in its impact on the **battle
network** of the future. That network will increasingly include a large
number of **cheaper**, **more connected**, and **more resilient
systems** to function in a **rapidly evolving
battlefield**.]{.underline}

[5G has the capability to combine DoD's]{.underline} current
[**fragmented networks** into a **single network** to promote **improved
situational awareness** and **decision-making**. This expanded reach
will enable **new tech**nologies like **hypersonic weapons** and
**hypersonic defenses** to be deployed]{.underline}, [and has the
potential to strengthen existing missions like **nuclear
C3**]{.underline}. At an enterprise level, [5G can **vastly
improve**]{.underline} day-to-day tasks such as [**logistics** and
**maintenance**, elevating the efficiency and speed of work across
DoD]{.underline}.

However, [5G also presents a **serious**]{.underline} potential
[**risk** for DoD]{.underline} going forward. When operating overseas in
the future, the [**vast majority** of]{.underline} these [networks and
systems may **depend** on **5G infra**structure. **If China
leads**]{.underline} the field [in 5G infrastructure]{.underline} and
systems, then [the future 5G ecosystem will]{.underline} likely [have
Chinese components **embedded** throughout. This would pose a **serious
threat** to the **security** of DoD operations]{.underline} and networks
going forward. Additionally, [the growth in the number of **connected
devices** increases the potential "**attack surface**" for adversaries
to target across DoD networks, which will require
**increased**]{.underline} vigilance and [**security** across
systems]{.underline}. The larger volume of data being transferred will
complicate this task, as it will make it more difficult to detect
malicious traffic on a network.

#### Adversarial hypersonic weapons destroy [early-warning capabilities]{.underline}\-\--collapses [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

William **Schneider 22**, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, former
under-secretary of state and chair of the Pentagon's Defense Science
Board, 2/6/2022, \"China and Russia's hypersonic weaponry threatens US
early warning system,\"
<https://www.ft.com/content/7d566088-7d25-4fde-9b02-311f86eb845e>, RMax

For those paying attention to the worrying advances in hypersonic
weaponry by China and Russia, the news that the [Pentagon is pushing US
defence companies to hasten]{.underline} their own [progress on
**hypersonic weapons**]{.underline} is a welcome development. [The race
must]{.underline} now [be on to **catch up**, or risk **ceding the
advantage** to America's **adversaries**]{.underline}.

[Both China and Russia conducted **hypersonic missile tests**
in]{.underline} the summer of [2021. Russia's]{.underline} test of its
hypersonic [Skyfall nuclear-powered]{.underline} and nuclear-armed
cruise missile took place at its Novaya Zemlya Island test range in the
Arctic Ocean. Being nuclear powered, the [missile has **unlimited
range**]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} also [conducted **two flight tests**]{.underline} of
hypersonic ballistic missiles. One flew in a fractional earth orbit on a
manoeuvring trajectory to the target region in China. The other also
flew on a manoeuvring trajectory, and additionally released a second
hypersonic object --- a "first" for any nation.

The [significance of these tests was]{.underline} quickly [brushed off
by]{.underline} both the [arms control community and the
media]{.underline}. Russia's was reduced to environmental disregard ("a
flying Chernobyl") while China's was dismissed as "nothing new" since
Russian fractional orbital flights had taken placed during the cold war.

[These reactions **missed** the **importance** of such capabilities in
the **nuclear modernisation**]{.underline} efforts [of both China and
Russia. **Manoeuvring hypersonic vehicles** are not]{.underline} simply
[another means of delivering a nuclear warhead]{.underline} to a target.
Instead, [they are an **essential part** of a "system of systems"
designed to **defeat** the US's **early warning
abilities**]{.underline}.

[The US ballistic missile early warning system is a set of
**satellites** and **radars** that are integrated with their command,
control and communications system to detect, locate and track adversary
missile attacks]{.underline}. Taken together, [these]{.underline}
interdependent [capabilities are **crucial** to maintaining an
**effective nuclear deterrent**. They were so fundamental to **mutual
deterrence** during the cold war]{.underline} that the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty included provisions aimed at protecting
them from attack.

The evolving importance of space has been obscured by the seamless way
in which space capabilities have become integral to both everyday public
life and national security. But [operations]{.underline} there [are
**decisive** for **nuclear deterrence**]{.underline}.

[Both China and Russia have well developed]{.underline} advanced
[**offensive capabilities** in space]{.underline}. In late January, for
example, China's Shijian 21 (CJ-21) satellite disappeared from its
regular position in geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above the earth.
The CJ-21 manoeuvred close to one of China's malfunctioning satellites
in its 35-satellite Beidou constellation. There it used a grappling arm
to move the malfunctioning satellite to a "graveyard" orbit.

The Space Priorities Framework published by the Biden administration in
December recognises space as "critical to modern warfare", but continues
to adhere to its position that the US will not use space for offensive
military applications. This leaves our deterrent vulnerable to nations
who do not share this view.

The US is developing a space-based system that uses advanced infrared
sensors which may be able to detect manoeuvring hypersonic warheads.
However, current missile defence systems do not permit them to engage
with rapidly manoeuvring warheads. China and Russia have also developed
counter systems that jeopardise US space monitoring and communications
capabilities at low, medium and high altitudes.

By manoeuvring their satellites for offensive space operations adjacent
to US satellites, China and Russia could conduct a wide variety of
offensive operations. These include disrupting, spoofing or destroying
sensors, on-board computation, data links or satellite electric power
systems, and inserting malicious code using cyber techniques.

All of this is augmented by their ability to employ both cyber and
kinetic capabilities to attack critical American infrastructure. This is
the basis upon which military operations depend, as well as the electric
power system, national telecommunications and the air and rail
transportation systems that underpin US economic and military power.

[China and Russia's]{.underline} manoeuvring [**hypersonic missile
capabilities** enable these adversarial powers to have an integrated
capacity to defeat the US early warning system]{.underline}. Under these
circumstances, [the US would be **blind** to an **incoming foreign
missile attack**]{.underline}, and its ability to respond significantly
constrained.

Strategic Implications of Hypersonic Weapons

Compressed Timelines

The U.S. military uses an acronym to describe the decisionmaking and
action process cycle: OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). These four
steps take time, and hypersonic missiles compress available response
time to the point that a lesser nation's strategic forces might be
disarmed before acting. As an illustration of the time required to act
with respect to an existential missile threat, [the Nuclear Threat
Initiative organization estimated]{.underline} a timeline for [a U.S.
response to a massive Russian]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic
missile ([ICBM]{.underline}) [attack]{.underline}, as
[follows]{.underline}:9

• 0 minutes---Russia launches missiles

• 1 minute---U.S. satellite detects missiles

• 2 minutes---U.S. radar detects missiles

• 3 minutes---North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) assesses
information (2 minutes max)

• 4 minutes---NORAD alerts White House

• 5 minutes---first detonations of submarine-launched ballistic missiles

• 7 minutes---locate president and advisers, assemble them, brief them,
get decision (8 minutes max)

• 13 minutes---decision

• 15 minutes---transmit orders to start launch sequence

• 20 minutes---launch officers receive, decode, and authenticate orders

• 23 minutes---complete launch sequence (2 minutes max)

• **[25 minutes]{.underline}**---Russian ICBM detonations.

[This]{.underline} timeline [is not, of course, representative of two
hostile parties in closer proximity or with less effective warning
systems]{.underline} than Russia and the United States. [Nor is it
representative of less-than-Armageddon possibilities. However,
for]{.underline} **[adjacent enemies]{.underline}** [within
a]{.underline} [**1,000-km range**, a hypersonic missile traveling at
**ten times the speed of sound**]{.underline} [could cover that distance
and reduce response times to about]{.underline} **[six
minutes]{.underline}**.10

Targets

As discussed earlier, [hypersonic missiles **increase the
threat**]{.underline} [over current generations]{.underline} of missiles
[in cases where the target]{.underline} nation [has]{.underline}
**[missile defenses]{.underline}**. The targets in such nations would
primarily be high value and heavily defended. [Prime targets could
include destroying a nation's leadership and command and control,
referred to as "decapitation," to prevent the target nation from
responding with an effective follow-on attack. Other key targets could
be carrier strike groups]{.underline}, with the objective of striking a
key blow or pushing the naval formation further from the coast. And,
[because of their time sensitivity, strategic forces and storage
facilities for]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
(**[WMDs]{.underline}**) [could warrant hypersonic attack]{.underline}.

Implications for Targeted Nations

[Any government faced with the]{.underline} **[possibility that
hypersonic missiles would be employed against
it]{.underline}**---particularly in a decapitating attack--- [would
plan]{.underline} **[countermeasures]{.underline}**, many of [which
could be]{.underline} **[destabilizing]{.underline}**. For example,
countermeasures could include [devolution of]{.underline} strategic
forces' **[command and control]{.underline}** so that lower levels of
authority could execute a strategic strike, which [would]{.underline}
obviously [increase the risk of]{.underline} **[accidental strategic
war]{.underline}**; or [strategic forces]{.underline} could be
[more]{.underline} **[widely dispersed]{.underline}**--- a tactic
[risk]{.underline}ing greater exposure to [**subnational capture**. An
obvious measure would be]{.underline} a
**[l]{.underline}**aunch-**[o]{.underline}**n-**[w]{.underline}**arning
[posture]{.underline}---[a]{.underline} **[hair-trigger
tactic]{.underline}** [that would increase]{.underline} crisis
[**instability**. Or the target nation could adopt a policy
of]{.underline} **[preemption]{.underline}** during a
crisis---[**guarantee**ing]{.underline} **[highly destructive military
action.]{.underline}** To be sure, such measures could be invoked
against threats from current types of missiles.11 But, for nations with
effective ballistic mis- sile and/or cruise missile defenses in the time
frame when hypersonic missiles might proliferate, the hard choices would
be forced when facing hypersonic threats.

[**Advanced** nations with adequate resources could]{.underline} take
other steps against hypersonic threats. They [could strengthen the
resilience of their command and control, **harden** the siting of their
strategic forces, and make a deterrent force mobile or sea-based. These
tactics]{.underline} may or **[may not be effective]{.underline}**,
especially **[for lesser nations]{.underline}**. [And]{.underline}
[they]{.underline} certainly [will be]{.underline}
[**expensive**---putting them]{.underline} **[out of
reach]{.underline}** [of some]{.underline}. Even for major powers, the
[proliferation of hypersonic missiles will create new threats by
allowing lesser powers to hold them at risk of effective missile
attacks]{.underline} especially [against]{.underline} **["unhardened"
targets, e.g., cities]{.underline}**. Over the coming decades, the
ability of a lesser nation with a handful of ICBMs to threaten major
powers will continue to decrease as wide area missile defenses continue
to improve. However, HGVs and HCMs will be more difficult to defend
against.

Implications for Major Powers

The ability of hypersonic missiles to penetrate advanced missile
defenses will increase the risks for nations with such defenses.
**[Lesser powers]{.underline}** [with **hypersonic** weapon**s** may see
these weapons as a]{.underline} **[deterrent]{.underline}** against
greater power intervention, [and]{.underline} feel free to
[pursue]{.underline} potentially **[destabilizing regional
agendas]{.underline}**. Moreover, [lesser nations with hypersonic
missiles could affect]{.underline} the **[force
deployments]{.underline}** of major powers. As noted above,
**[c]{.underline}**arrier **[s]{.underline}**trike
**[g]{.underline}**roup**[s]{.underline}** [might be pushed further
**out to sea**]{.underline} [or an intervening power's regional
**military bases**]{.underline} [might become exposed]{.underline} to
more effective attacks.

The Broader Picture of Increased Risk

[The ability of hypersonic forces to]{.underline} **[penetrate
defenses]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[compress decision
time]{.underline}** [could aggravate]{.underline} the
**[instabilities]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} regions that are
already tense---for example, **[Iran-Israel]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea[--**Japan**. Conflicts in these regions could
**evolve**]{.underline} [to include]{.underline} [**major powers aligned
on opposite sides**. An]{.underline} **[Israel-Iran]{.underline}**
[conflict, with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} much of
**[Europe]{.underline}** [aligned with Israel and]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} perhaps
**[China]{.underline}** [aligned with]{.underline} [**Iran**, would
create]{.underline} new **[paths for escalation to an even-larger
conflict]{.underline}**. The basic roles of external actors would not
necessarily change---the alignments would stay the same---but [external
powers might suddenly find themselves in a]{.underline} more-**[unstable
situation]{.underline}** [in which their patron states are]{.underline}
**[increasingly trigger-happy]{.underline}**. As noted previously,
lesser powers could gain influence over major powers by threatening a
hypersonic attack. At the least, [lesser powers might be emboldened if
they saw themselves as possessing a deterrent against major power
intervention]{.underline}. Finally, because [hypersonic
weapons]{.underline} increase the expectation of a disarming attack,
they **[lower the threshold]{.underline}** [for military
action]{.underline}.

Cyber Threats

However, [from a **cyber-space perspective**, 5G technology also
**increases drastically** the **attack surface**]{.underline} (in some
ways previously non-existent) [and the number of potential entry points
for attackers]{.underline}. The [increased speed of the connected
devices could make them more vulnerable to]{.underline} Distributed
Denial-of-Service [**(DDoS) attacks**. In today's era of
4G]{.underline}/LTE mobile Internet, [a large
botnet]{.underline}10 [formed simply by hacking a user's home devices
could be used to launch large-scale DDoS attacks against websites; in
**tomorrow's**]{.underline} b [**5G network era**, a **similar botnet**
could disrupt an **entire network** of autonomous cars in a
city]{.underline}11. As a result, [the wide range of services and
applications]{.underline}, as well as the novel features in the
architecture, [will introduce a **plethora** of **new security
challenges**]{.underline}.

It was [in September 2016]{.underline} when [hackers succeeded in
scanning and exploiting hundreds of thousands of low-cost]{.underline}
and low-powered [IoT devices]{.underline} such as IP cameras, home
routers, and digital video recorders, [and turned them into **remotely
controlled bots**]{.underline} by using 'Mirai' malware to launch large
scale DDoS attacks. Not only 5G technology itself but also [the
communication between devices]{.underline} connected to the internet
[can be the **weakest link** in 5G's security]{.underline}. If the
manufactures of those low-cost interconnected devices do not embed
cybersecurity standards in their products, the security risks will
remain high.

[5G networks]{.underline} and smart devices [must adopt **reliable** and
**long-term security requirements**]{.underline} beginning in the early
stages of the design and manufacturing processes in order [to fulfil
their technological promises]{.underline}. By embracing a structured
'cyber hygiene policy', 5G technology can eventually be effectively
implemented in Air Operations to improve communications and situational
awareness.

Enhancing Air Power

[**NATO Allied Forces** can gain **great advantages** by
leveraging]{.underline} the novel features of [5G]{.underline} cellular
[technology. Communications and network operations in the air
battlespace will be able to handle **far more data** at **much faster
speeds** supporting real-time video streaming and VR applications. The
wide employment of]{.underline} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles [**(UAVs)** for
purposes ranging from]{.underline} Intelligence, Surveillance &
Reconnaissance [**(ISR)** to **airstrikes** is expected to evolve even
further in terms of geographic coverage and efficiency. Even
**logistic** and **maintenance activities**, such as tracking
maintenance stocks and conducting technical inspections, could benefit
from a reliable and secure mobile connectivity]{.underline}.

[**Modern logistics systems** such as the Autonomic Logistics
Information System (ALIS) for the **Joint Strike Fighter**, are
integrated with maintenance and operations procedures]{.underline} from
across the world [identifying **problems** with the aircraft, installing
**software updates**, and providing **preventive actions**]{.underline}.
[**5G tech**nology can **clearly enhance productivity** and **safety**
of such]{.underline} complex, [large-scale and interconnected military
logistics operations transforming them to '**sophisticated weapon
systems'**]{.underline} ready to use even on the battlefield.

[5G networks have the ability to expand the range of **cloud-based
applications** and **exponentially increase** the amount of data
transmitted and exchanged during **air combat operations**]{.underline}.
The challenge of infobesity (information overload) can still be
encountered using digital technologies that take advantage of the
super-fast, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication environment
that 5G provides. [Consolidating the extracted information from
internet-connected sensors]{.underline} and platforms, [and immediately
distributing the]{.underline} acquired [knowledge to]{.underline} the
[Command and Control structure is **essential** to facilitate **'smart'
decision-making**]{.underline}12. Therefore, [**securing (allied)
military networks** and maintaining]{.underline} their [**high level of
interoperability** will become]{.underline} even more
**[critical]{.underline}**.

According to an 'EU coordinated risk assessment report'13, published on
9 October 2019, among the main threats and vulnerabilities of 5G
networks are the high dependencies on individual suppliers. The lack of
diversity in equipment and infrastructure can lead to increased exposure
to attacks by State-sponsored actors who interfere with the suppliers.
Thus, the individual risk profile of suppliers will become particularly
important, especially for those with significant presence within
networks.

In order to develop a secure 5G mobile network strategy, the US
Department of Defence (DoD) decided, about a year ago, to strengthen the
requirements for the supply chain of innovative technology products,
including subcontractors, by introducing higher cybersecurity standards
that would ensure resiliency to cyber-attacks. The established
public-private partnership, known as 'Trusted Capital Marketplace',
connects defence technology start-ups with trusted sources of capital in
order to secure the delivery of such critical emerging technologies14.

Future Challenges

[With the future]{.underline} stand-alone **[5G
ecosystem]{.underline}**, as described above, [**all network
functionalities** will be **virtualised** based on **software** rather
than **hardware**, and take place within a single cloud environment. 5G
networks are going to be deployed in a **complex global cybersecurity
threat**]{.underline} landscape. [To ensure
**confidentiality**]{.underline} (authorised access),
**[integrity]{.underline}** (accurate information) [and
**availability**]{.underline} (any time access) [with such a
revolutionary technology]{.underline} and confront the challenges
derived from it, [NATO]{.underline} member and partner [countries will
have to follow a **new security paradigm**. Current cybersecurity
models]{.underline} and policies [must be **reassessed** and new
security frameworks applied in order to **mitigate risks** and
threats]{.underline}.

[Are Alliance members determined to]{.underline} invest the resources
necessary for [establish]{.underline}ing [a **resilient** and **secure**
infrastructure for **5G technology**? Are we willing to adapt to this
emerging technology at the speed of change and not lagging behind other
competing nations? Those questions have to be answered as **clearly**
and **decisively** as possible in the **very near future**]{.underline}.

#### 2\-\--Naval Power.

**Capela '21** \[Germano; July 2021; Radio Engineer at the NATO
Communications and Information Agency, M.S. in Electrical and Computer
Engineering from the Instituto Superior Técnico, M.Sc. in Electrical,
Electronics, and Communications Engineering from Escola Naval; et al.;
\"5G for deployable and maritime communications,\"
https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCIS52405.2021.9486397\]

In this section we propose an experiment, using the combined 5G
proof-of-concept prototype, to assess the feasibility of 5G-enabled
concepts for providing coastal communications in support of ship-shore
and relayed ship-ship-shore communications, as depicted in the left
portion of Fig. 1. In such conditions, ships are in line-of-sight (LOS)
distances to shore based infrastructures and between each other
(typically less than 20 km), in a benign/friendly territory and far from
intentionally contested EM environment. For this scenario, it is
considered the use of [high-performance 5G systems]{.underline} to
[provide **interoperable**, **high capacity**, **extended coverage** and
**low latency** connectivity between commands **ashore** and
**afloat**]{.underline}.

B. Technical Concept

In this context, [a]{.underline} primarily PTMP [shore based system
enables high throughput reach back communications for ships]{.underline}
that are within coastal coverage. [This allows non satellite
communications]{.underline} (SATCOM) [capable units to effectively
**reach back** and access **C2** and **enterprise systems**, while at
sea. This solution]{.underline} also [provides a **backup** medium
against SATCOM **downtimes**, or even an offloading route to SATCOM
traffic]{.underline}, within the areas mentioned. [Considering a **naval
force** scenario]{.underline} in the areas mentioned, [a combination of
**PTMP** and **mesh topologies** can effectively **extend the limits**
of LOS coverage]{.underline} by shore based systems, [through multi--hop
range extension. Maritime scenarios]{.underline} typically [address
**multinational operations**, therefore **interoperability between
systems is key** for effective **communications** between **different
nations**]{.underline}.

[Even though most ships]{.underline} these days [are fitted with SATCOM
reach back systems, such systems might not necessarily be used/available
for all the **range** of **assigned missions**, due to **availability**
and **cost** reasons. SATCOM is **costly to operate**]{.underline}, both
on--board and on the ground/space segments, which might not be necessary
in mainly shallow water operations. Alternatively, HF based beyond line
of sight (BLOS) reach back systems are utilized, but with very limited
throughput capacity, offering a very last resort alternative to SATCOM
reach back services. [For ships]{.underline} operating [in close
proximity]{.underline} (i.e. within LOS), [ship-ship communications
based on SATCOM are very inefficient, as the **delay** and **jitter**
introduced by each reach back link significantly impact **real time
dissemination** of information]{.underline}.

[Currently, **NATO** does not use these **concepts**, as traditional
enabling LOS radio technologies]{.underline} (e.g. V/UHF tactical
radios) [do not offer **suitable performance** to be used as alternative
to **SATCOM**]{.underline}. On the other hand, [traditional IMT
technologies, such as **LTE**, have **limited spectrum supportability**
and limited **antenna technology** to handle interference, **challenging
propagation** and **environmental conditions**]{.underline} (e.g. ships
mobility and dynamics (roll and pitch) limit the use of stationary high
gain antennas).

The likelihood and severity of EW threats in coastal communications is
deemed low, as this scenario consists of ships operating in NATO
territory, in benign/friendly areas and far from intentionally contested
EM environments. Nevertheless, from a ship's perspective, the EM
environment can be regarded as complex for two reasons:

Military vessels are complex compositions of radio-- enabled systems,
resulting in crowded and packed antenna farms, which potentiates mutual
interference phenomena.

As ships approach coastal areas, the exposure to various sources of
(unintentional) interference increases dramatically as a result of
land--based systems radiating towards the sea.

[Deploying **ship-shore** and **ship-ship** communications based on **5G
technology**]{.underline} (which has intrinsic frequency and antenna
agility features) [would provide **significant operational
benefits**]{.underline}, such as:

- [Effective alternative to SATCOM reach back links]{.underline} in
  coastal areas.

- [Multinational **interoperability** based on **international
  standards**]{.underline}.

- [Multi--hop **range extension** for]{.underline} groups of
  [ships]{.underline} operating [in close proximity]{.underline}.

- [**Low latency** and **high throughput** ship-ship
  communications]{.underline}.

C. Requirements for a 5G--based Proof of Concept

As this scenario concerns the use of shore-based infrastructures in
benign/friendly territory, the backbone of the 5G-based concept, i.e.
the 5G core and radio access network, can be based on either publicly or
privately owned infrastructure. The selected approach will significantly
depend on the requirements of the target implementations, namely,
coverage, operation and management models and security. The proposed
technical architecture is illustrated in Fig. 3.

For this architecture, [a]{.underline} two-tier [high-capacity 5G-based
system]{.underline}, with multiband support, i.e. support to the 700 MHz
(low band) and the 5G Sub--6--GHz (ideally in the 4.4-5.0 GHz NATO Band
IV) frequency bands, [would provide both **capacity** and
**flexibility** in various link and EM conditions. **Multiband support**
and **frequency agility** are vital strategies for **adequate
coexistence** in complex EM environment]{.underline}, i.e. coexistence
with other radio and sensor systems and exposure to shore-based
interferences, and for dynamic adaptation to varying propagation
conditions. For the use of public networks, [network
slicing]{.underline} is identified as enabler of services and network
segregation (control and user planes), but it [also becomes a relevant
**security feature** for **military use** of **public infrastructure**
due to its **network segregation** properties]{.underline}.

There is little historical evidence that **[air]{.underline}** and naval
power **[alone]{.underline}** is sufficient, but much to suggest that a
unified joint force [can]{.underline} **[deter and defeat aggression
quite effectively]{.underline}**. Since Giulio Douhet first theorized
that airpower could win wars by itself by **[terrorizing a
population]{.underline}** [and causing a government to
**capitulate**]{.underline} (that is, "**[shock and
awe]{.underline}**"), these theories have repeatedly failed, been
updated, and again proved wanting. Strategic bombing failed to defeat
aggression by Germany and Japan, but air superiority enabled decisive
joint offensives to defeat their military forces. While Operation
Linebacker had greater coercive effect than Rolling Thunder, the Vietnam
War would not have ended without integrated air-land operations that
defeated the 1972 North Vietnamese offensive on the ground. [In **Desert
Storm**]{.underline}, [air operations]{.underline} failed to force Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait, but **[degraded the enemy]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[helped ground forces achieve campaign
objectives]{.underline}** in 100 hours with 148 U.S. battle deaths. In
Kosovo, airstrikes were a critical component of a successful coercion
campaign, but they were insufficient to compel Slobodan Miloševic´ to
halt ethnic cleansing or agree to terms without the credible threat of
ground operations.27 In Afghanistan, strategic air attacks failed to
defeat the Taliban, but [precision close air support enabled **Afghan
allies**]{.underline} with U.S. special operations forces [to seize
Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul]{.underline}. In Iraq, airstrikes failed to
"shock and awe" Saddam Hussein and his security forces into surrender,
but they enabled and protected dispersed small units operating over wide
areas.

Thus the leaders of **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea[,
**Iran**, and **Syria**]{.underline} [may]{.underline} well
**[conclude]{.underline}** that sanctions and **[airstrikes
alone]{.underline}** [are **not sufficient**]{.underline} to deter them
from attacking neighbors, killing civilians, launching catastrophic
cyber attacks, or supporting terrorist attacks against the homeland. If
adversaries believe they can achieve their objectives by exploiting
irregular tactics or complex terrain, then the threat of airstrikes may
not "deter by denial." If adversaries believe the cost of agreeing to
U.S. terms is unacceptable and remain willing to endure hardships, then
the threat of airstrikes may not "deter by punishment" or compel them to
concede. The United States typically demands a significant sacrifice
from an adversary without considering his reaction---for example, a
dictator must abdicate (for example, Libya and Syria) or relinquish an
important territory (Kuwait and Kosovo). In cases in which a leader's
survival depends on his or her demonstrated power to rule, resistance
may well be preferable to surrender.

If the optimistic force-sizing assumptions about the efficacy of smart
power prove invalid in future contingencies, [there would be
**significant military risk**]{.underline} to defeat aggression and
respond to another contingency, and higher risk if continued budget cuts
reduce Active-duty end-strength well below currently programmed levels
or compromise readiness. This means that combatant commanders would lack
the forces required to achieve strategic objectives, or Reserve forces
would be deployed in combat before they are fully trained, or land
forces would remain in direct combat much longer than evidence suggests
could be reasonably endured by volunteer citizens without compromising
the quality of the force.28

The alternative approach to deterring and defeating regional aggression
would restore emphasis on decisive joint campaigns within the
force-planning construct while still including other missions such as
irregular warfare, counterterrorism, peacekeeping, and homeland defense.
Specifically, Joint Force 2020 would be sized to conduct operations as
joint campaigns that stress all Services in terms of critical
capabilities (see table).

\[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\]

The force-planning construct shown in the table offers advantages that
enhance regional deterrence. In cases of conflict with North Korea and
Syria, ground forces enable the joint force to:

> protect people, defend territory, and secure resources
>
> defeat threats in complex terrain
>
> achieve a favorable and longer lasting outcome
>
> demonstrate U.S. resolve to allies and adversaries.

These advantages are relevant in deterring the emergent challenges
defined above. For example, to [deter]{.underline} **[nuclear
transfer]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[terrorism]{.underline}**,

*target states should announce they reserve the right to take
large-scale military action, to include invasion and occupation, against
territories of central importance to any non-state actor that attacks
them with nuclear weapons, and any entity that provides the attackers
with substantial material or financial support.29*

This **[decisive joint capability]{.underline}** [would introduce
**uncertainty into adversary calculations**]{.underline}, as well as the
calculations of their hosts and supporters should they be nonstate
actors and cause them to consider the consequences of their actions
beyond enduring airstrikes.

[The result]{.underline} of this alternative approach [is]{.underline} a
balanced joint force with the credible capability [to]{.underline}
**[deter and defeat aggression by rogue states]{.underline}**,
[secure]{.underline} **[WMD in failing states]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} still [**deter China from attacking U.S. allies**. It
provides the President with more **flexible options** to respond to
**unforeseen events**]{.underline}. The disadvantage for some defense
planners is that disproportionate cuts to ground forces were intended to
pay for offensive Air-Sea Battle capabilities to defeat China in a war
for which there is no credible theory for victory, [and]{.underline}
given the risk of **[mutual]{.underline}** economic or **[nuclear
destruction]{.underline}**, one that no President or Secretary of
Defense would willingly enter.

#### Independently, 5G cybersecurity prevents [NC3 entanglement]{.underline}.

Robert **Spalding 22**, former Senior Director of Strategy to the
President at the National Security Council, founder and CEO of SEMPRE,

Should Embrace Hardened 5G, Edge Computing,\"

RMax

[Joint all-domain command and control, or **JADC2**]{.underline}, is the
military's latest buzzy acronym and one of the stated priorities for the
Defense Department. Yet it [is a concept **without** a **clear
solution** and is likely to **languish** without]{.underline} the
[infrastructure to ensure its success]{.underline}.

[One of the biggest challenges]{.underline} for JADC2 [is
**interoperability**]{.underline}. Today, just [in **nuclear c**ommand
and **c**ontrol]{.underline}, which is a subset of JADC2, [there
are]{.underline} more than [100 programs]{.underline} underway. Since
[these programs]{.underline} often [involve technology]{.underline} that
was [not built to be interoperable, **bridging info**rmation is a
**challenge**]{.underline}. [Data becomes **trapped** and unable to be
used **quickly** to build a **comprehensive picture** for **decision
makers**]{.underline}.

The question becomes, [why not use the cloud?]{.underline} There, the
focus is on data transport. If we could just get the data to the cloud,
then we could solve many of the problems. But then [that raises the
question, which cloud? And]{.underline} inevitably, [how]{.underline} do
I move my data there[?]{.underline}

[There are many **different clouds** with **different architectures**,
which makes managing information across]{.underline} disparate
[platforms **difficult**]{.underline}. And there is no easy way to
onboard cloud service providers. The department attempted to do so
through a competition called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure
initiative. Doomed from the start, the program envisioned a
winner-take-all cloud service procurement scenario. If that is not a
recipe for stagnant innovation, I'm not sure what is.

So, how does the military move data? [There are numerous transport
networks]{.underline} that are [designed to carry]{.underline} the [bits
and bytes of JADC2 back to some]{.underline} all-knowing
[cloud]{.underline} --- Starlink, OneWeb, Hughes Network Systems,
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Iridium and on and on. Which will win?

[Probably all in some fashion since the pie is so big. And that's just
the satellite providers. Don't forget the **telecom service providers**
and fiber-optic companies]{.underline}, which also play a part in this
orchestra.

[What is consistent about these technologies?]{.underline} They
represent separate networks that need a gateway and a location to
on-ramp and off-ramp data between and among them.

The answer the tech industry seems to be offering is the cloud. [The
cloud]{.underline}, however, [is **not ubiquitous**. The data centers
that can be the gateways for moving, transferring and processing data
are often **large** and **centralized**. This presents an **incredible
juicy target** for]{.underline} would-be **[attackers]{.underline}**.

[Even if they were **one single network**, we still wouldn't have the
bandwidth to move the bulk of the data to the cloud]{.underline}. Often,
[by the time data does make it to the cloud, it is **too late** to
enable]{.underline} the [processing **required** to make]{.underline}
the [information]{.underline} gleaned **[actionable]{.underline}**. Once
again, [**warfighters** are **stuck** with **data
islands**]{.underline}.

[**Multiple independent networks** and **stuck data** turn out to be
**two main challenges** that the **Defense Department** needs to solve.
How is it possible]{.underline} to harness the power of the commercial
sector [to solve these problems? The answer lies in **5G** and edge
computing.]{.underline}

[5G is best known for providing]{.underline} the [radio access
technology]{.underline} in the latest generation of cellular networks,
[but it is **far more** than that. 5G]{.underline} also [represents the
implementation of **virtual network functions**, **software-defined
networking** and **transport gateways** for the]{.underline} already
[interoperable wireless networks]{.underline}.

The industry standards body, 3rd Generation Partnership Project, or
3GPP, has taken on this challenge. A recent release envisions a set of
standards for interoperability that combines computers, networking and
storage across the different layers of commercial communication. It
covers radio-access network standards to include network-to-network
links. Properly configured, a 5G stand-alone network anywhere in the
world should be able to hand off a slice of the network to a device
according to the resource needs of the customer.

[At the **heart** of **5G** is **edge computing**. Without edge
computing, **trapped data** will become a **problem** for **commercial
cellular networks**]{.underline} as the devices attached to 5G networks
multiply with their use.

Autonomous systems and the artificial intelligence algorithms that seek
to make sense of data at the edge will require computing at the edge.

There will not be enough bandwidth to transport the data to centralized
clouds for processing. These edge nodes will bring the power of
applications to the data. Some of these applications will create the
opportunity for wireless gateways at the edge that bring fiber, telecom
and satellite together into one seamless network. This network can be
reconfigured on the fly, for any application, because it is entirely
constructed in software.

It seems logical that [embracing commercial 5G]{.underline} and edge
computing standards for JADC2 [would be a **no-brainer**. The problem is
that 3GPP is **not built** for the **battlefield**]{.underline}.

Commercial networks are built to commercial standards. As a former B-2
pilot, [**commercial networks** look like an **easy target**, and
judging from the bombing two years ago of a **Nashville** AT&T
communications hub, you **don't** even need a **plane**]{.underline} to
take them down.

[How do you build a]{.underline} 21st century [**secure**, **hardened**,
**hyper-converged network**?]{.underline} First, [it would be
electromagnetic pulse hardened. Russia, China and North
Korea]{.underline} --- and soon perhaps Iran --- [have **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. Depending on the altitude of the burst, [a
single nuclear weapon detonated in the upper atmosphere]{.underline}
above the United States [could take out the **grid** and
**communications networks** and **data centers**]{.underline}.

Second, [the network would be resistant to]{.underline} physical
[tampering and ensure]{.underline} the [provenance and security of both
the hardware and software]{.underline}.

Third, the personnel who work on this network would be vetted, and more
than one would be required to do any work of a critical nature on the
hardware or software.

Finally, the network would be configured in such a way so that
classified systems could operate securely on the infrastructure,
alongside commercial applications.

#### NC3 entanglement [guarantees]{.underline} escalation\-\--maintaining stable communications is key.

Outcomes? Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation," *Arms Control

edited for ableist language

In January 2018, details of the Trump administration's Nuclear Posture
Review (NPR) were posted online by the Huffington Post, provoking
widespread alarm over what were viewed as dangerous shifts in U.S.
nuclear policy. Arousing most concern was a call for the acquisition of
several types of low-yield nuclear weapons, a proposal viewed by many
analysts as increasing the risk of nuclear weapons use.

Another [initiative]{.underline} incorporated [in]{.underline} the
[strategy document]{.underline} also [aroused concern: the claim that an
enemy cyber**attack** on U.S. nuclear command, control, and
communications (**NC3**) facilities would **constitute** a "non-nuclear
**strategic attack**" of **sufficient** magnitude to justify the use of
**nuclear weapons** in **response**]{.underline}.

Under the Obama administration's NPR report, released [in]{.underline}
April [**2010**, the circumstances under which]{.underline} the [United
States would]{.underline} consider [respond]{.underline}ing to
non-nuclear attacks [with nuclear weapons were]{.underline} said to be
**[few]{.underline}**. "The United States will continue to...reduce the
role of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear attacks," the report
stated. Although little was said about what sort of non-nuclear attacks
might be deemed severe enough to justify a nuclear response,
cyberstrikes were not identified as one of these. The
**[2018]{.underline}** NPR report, however, [portrayed a **very
different environment**]{.underline}, one [in which **nuclear combat**
is seen as **increasingly possible** and in which non-nuclear strategic
threats]{.underline}, especially in cyberspace, [were viewed as
sufficiently menacing to justify a **nuclear response**]{.underline}.
Speaking of Russian technological progress, for example, the draft
version of the Trump administration's NPR report stated, "To...correct
any Russian misperceptions of advantage, [the president will
have]{.underline} an [**expanding range** of]{.underline} limited and
graduated [**\[nuclear\] options** to]{.underline} credibly
[deter]{.underline} Russian nuclear or non-nuclear strategic [attacks,
which]{.underline} could [now include]{.underline} attacks against U.S.
**[NC3]{.underline}**, in space and cyberspace."1

The [notion that a cyberattack]{.underline} on U.S. digital systems,
even those used for nuclear weapons, [would constitute **sufficient
grounds** to launch a **nuclear attack** was seen]{.underline} by many
observers [as]{.underline} a dangerous shift in policy, [**greatly
increasing** the risk of **accidental** or **inadvertent nuclear
escalation**]{.underline} in a crisis. "The entire broadening of the
landscape for nuclear deterrence is a very fundamental step in the wrong
direction," said former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. "I think the
idea of nuclear deterrence of cyberattacks, broadly, certainly does not
make any sense."2

Despite such admonitions, the Pentagon reaffirmed its views on the links
between cyberattacks and nuclear weapons use when it released the final
version of the NPR report in February 2018. The official text now states
that the president must possess a spectrum of nuclear weapons with which
to respond to "attacks against U.S. NC3," and it identifies cyberattacks
as one form of non-nuclear strategic warfare that could trigger a
nuclear response.

That [cyberwarfare had **risen** to this **level of
threat**]{.underline}, the 2018 NPR report indicated, was a product of
the [**enhanced cybercapabilities** of potential adversaries
and]{.underline} of the [**creeping obsolescence** of]{.underline} many
existing [U.S. NC3 systems]{.underline}. To overcome these
vulnerabilities, it called for substantial investment in an upgraded NC3
infrastructure. Not mentioned, however, were extensive U.S. efforts to
employ cybertools to infiltrate and potentially incapacitate the NC3
systems of likely adversaries, including Russia, China, and North Korea.

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, [the links between
**cyberwar** and **nuclear war** are growing]{.underline}.

The Nuclear-Cyber Connection

These links exist because the [**NC3 systems** of the United States and
other **nuclear-armed states** are heavily dependent on
**computers**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other [**digital
processors** for]{.underline} virtually [**every aspect** of their
operation]{.underline} and because [those systems are **highly
vulnerable** to cyberattack. Every nuclear force is
composed]{.underline}, most basically, [of weapons, **early-warning
radars**, launch facilities,]{.underline} and [the **top
officials**]{.underline}, usually presidents or prime ministers,
[empowered to initiate]{.underline} a [nuclear exchange. **Connecting
them all**]{.underline}, however, [is an **extended network of
communications** and **data-processing** systems]{.underline}, all
[reliant on **cyberspace**. **Warning systems**]{.underline}, ground-
and space-based, [must **constantly** watch for and analyze]{.underline}
possible [enemy missile launches. Data on]{.underline} actual [threats
must **rapidly** be communicated to **decision-makers**]{.underline},
who must then weigh possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes
to launch facilities, which in turn must provide attack vectors to
delivery systems. [**All of this** involves operations in
**cyberspace**]{.underline}, and it is in this domain that great power
rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a constant struggle for
advantage.

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. China has been accused
of engaging in widespread cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from
U.S. firms for economic and military advantages. Russia has been
accused, most extensively in the Robert Mueller report, of exploiting
cyberspace to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Nonstate
actors, including terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic
State group, have used the internet for recruiting combatants and
spreading fear. Criminal groups, including some thought to be allied
with state actors, such as North Korea, have used cyberspace to extort
money from banks, municipalities, and individuals.4 Attacks such as
these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian and military
cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet for
those who worry about strategic stability and the risks of nuclear
escalation, it is the threat of cyberattacks on NC3 systems that
provokes the greatest concern.

This concern stems from the fact that, despite the immense effort
devoted to protecting NC3 systems from cyberattack, no enterprise that
relies so extensively on computers and cyberspace can be made 100
percent invulnerable to attack. This is so because such systems employ
many devices and operating systems of various origins and vintages, most
incorporating numerous software updates and "patches" over time,
offering multiple vectors for attack. Electronic components can also be
modified by hostile actors during production, transit, or insertion; and
the whole system itself is dependent to a considerable degree on the
electrical grid, which itself is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far
less protected. Experienced "cyberwarriors" of every major power have
been working for years to probe for weaknesses in these systems and in
many cases have devised cyberweapons, typically, malicious software
(malware) and computer viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military
advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough [information has
become public to indicate that]{.underline} the **[major nuclear
powers]{.underline}**, notably China, Russia, and the United States,
along with such secondary powers as Iran and North Korea, [have
established extensive **cyberwarfare capabilities** and engage in
**offensive cyberoperations** on a regular basis, often aimed at
**critical military infrastructure**.]{.underline} "Cyberspace is a
contested environment where we are in constant contact with
adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see near-peer competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting
sustained campaigns below the level of armed conflict to erode American
strength and gain strategic advantage."

Although eager to speak of adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone
was noticeably but not surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S.
offensive operations in cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that
Cybercom took such action to disrupt possible Russian interference in
the 2018 midterm elections. "We created a persistent presence in
cyberspace to monitor adversary actions and crafted tools and tactics to
frustrate their efforts," he testified in February. According to press
accounts, this included a cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the Internet
Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St. Petersburg said to have been
deeply involved in generating disruptive propaganda during the 2016
presidential elections.6

Other press investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations
undertaken by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended
to disrupt Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by
sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with
the so-called Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended
to cause malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed
at either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states.

Efforts by strategic rivals of the United States to infiltrate and
eventually degrade U.S. nuclear infrastructure are far less documented
but thought to be no less prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to
have planted malware in the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with
the intent of cutting off the flow of electricity to critical NC3
facilities in the event of a major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power,
including the United States, is believed to have crafted cyberweapons
aimed at critical NC3 components and to have implanted malware in enemy
systems for potential use in some future confrontation.

Pathways to Escalation

Knowing that the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being
probed for weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be
activated in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation
from a nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional
weaponry, to a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and
then, potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in
advance, but those [**analysts** who have studied the subject worry
about]{.underline} the emergence of [**dangerous new pathways** for
**escalation**]{.underline}. Indeed, several such scenarios have been
identified.9

[The]{.underline} first and possibly [most dangerous path to escalation
would arise from]{.underline} the early [use of
cyberweapons]{.underline} in a great power crisis [to]{.underline}
paralyze [\[**compromise**\] the vital command, control, and
communications capabilities of an adversary]{.underline}, many of [which
serve **nuclear**]{.underline} and conventional [forces. In the "**fog
of war**" that would]{.underline} naturally [ensue from such an
encounter, the recipient]{.underline} of such an attack [might fear
more]{.underline} punishing [follow-up]{.underline} kinetic
[attacks]{.underline}, possibly [including the use of **nuclear
weapons**, and,]{.underline} fearing the loss of its own arsenal,
[**launch its weapons immediately**. This might occur]{.underline}, for
example, in a confrontation [between **NATO** and **Russian forces** in
**east** and **central Europe**]{.underline} or between U.S. and Chinese
forces in the Asia-Pacific region.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have
overwhelming incentives to go early with offensive cyber and
counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities or advantages." If these early attacks succeeded, "it could
result in huge military and coercive advantage for the attacker." This
might induce the recipient of such attacks to back down, affording its
rival a major victory at very low cost. Alternatively, however, the
recipient might view the attacks on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure as the prelude to a full-scale attack
aimed at neutralizing its nuclear capabilities and choose to strike
first. "It is worth considering," Miller and Fontaine concluded, "how
[even a **very limited attack**]{.underline} or incident [could set both
sides on a **slippery slope** to **rapid escalation**]{.underline}."10

What makes the insertion of latent malware in an adversary's NC3 systems
so dangerous is that it may not even need to be activated to increase
the risk of nuclear escalation. [If a nuclear-armed state comes to
believe]{.underline} that [its critical systems are infested with enemy
malware, its leaders might not trust]{.underline} the [information
provided by its early-warning systems]{.underline} in a crisis [and
might misconstrue the nature of an enemy attack, leading them
to]{.underline} overreact and possibly [launch their **nuclear weapons**
out of fear they are at risk of a **preemptive strike**.]{.underline}

"[The **uncertainty** caused by]{.underline} the unique [character of a
cyber threat could **jeopardize** the credibility of the **nuclear
deterrent** and undermine **strategic stability** in ways that advances
in nuclear and conventional weapons do **not**]{.underline}," Page O.
Stoutland and Samantha Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear
Threat Initiative. "\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code
into nuclear weapons through the supply chain that compromises the
effectiveness of those weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the
nuclear deterrent," undermining strategic stability.11 Without
confidence in the reliability of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, [a
nuclear-armed state may **misinterpret confusing signals** from its
early-warning systems and]{.underline}, fearing the worst, [**launch its
own** nuclear weapons rather than **lose** them to an enemy's first
strike]{.underline}. This makes the scenario proffered in the 2018 NPR
report, of a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that much more
alarming.

The advent of **[5G]{.underline}**
technology [is]{.underline} heralded as [the
**glue** that will enable the **integration** of]{.underline} emerging
and disruptive technologies [**(EDTs)** into military
operations]{.underline}.

[**NATO militaries** are shifting from]{.underline}
a [**platforms-based** defense to]{.underline} one revolving around
[**systems**. This would see long-term, multipurpose assets like tanks
and aircraft carriers replaced by narrowly
purposed]{.underline}, nimble, expendable,
[and data-informed capabilities fully integrated into the
force structure]{.underline}. But [the effective **collection**,
**sharing**, and **operational potential** of **data**
in the decision-making process will only be possible if 5G networks
are **advanced** and **resilient**]{.underline}.

[There is a **problem**]{.underline} here --- [5G's capacity
to revolutionize conflict is]{.underline} still [somewhat

**capacity** of their **military 5G** networks]{.underline}. These
include:

- [prioritizing resilience]{.underline} through redundancy

- [broadband-spectrum sharing]{.underline}

- [**enhancing interoperability**, and]{.underline}

- [industrial]{.underline} and regulatory [collaboration]{.underline}.

In December, [Latvia unveiled Europe's
**first** 5G military **testing site** at Ādaži Military
Base]{.underline}, which allows Latvian and NATO forces to
test, uncover and resolve security vulnerabilities in the
network. This site enables deeper integration into defense systems and
provides alliance members with "testing grounds" for innovative
5G applications. [The Ādaži base can]{.underline} also
[offer **lessons** to other NATO members as they develop
their national 5G capabilities for military use, including]{.underline}
the possibilities of [5G in]{.underline} autonomous systems and
Joint-All Domain Command and Control [(JADC2), the **U.S. program** to
connect all **military** and space sensors in a **single
network**]{.underline}. Continued, [**joint testing** is the **most
important** way to refine the possibilities of 5G in future warfare
characterized by autonomous systems, data, algorithms,
and JADC2]{.underline}.

[These advancements]{.underline}, however, [**pale** in comparison to
the 5G developments by **adversarial states**. China is a **pioneer**,
having already developed 5G]{.underline} unmanned aerial vehicle [(UAV)
applications for]{.underline} package [deliveries]{.underline}, aerial
[photographs, and emergency communications. **Western
states must develop their 5G defense capabilities** strategically to
remain **competitive** and make up for the **lost time**]{.underline}.

[The **dual-use** functionality of 5G]{.underline} technology
[means]{.underline} that [a broad range of actors including the
military, security services]{.underline}, civil society, [and private
companies are **integral** to achieving **resilience** and **effective
implementation**]{.underline}. Redundant structures and
systems, especially between government and
commercial enterprises, reduce the ability of malign actors to
immobilize those systems by creating multiple networks
for operation. This redundancy also integrates civil sector network
defense, bolstering the potential for a whole-of-society response to
threats.

There is some debate on how best to allocate the broadband
spectrum between governments and civil society, which determines how
insulated 5G defense systems are from attacks. [For **NATO defenses**,
dividing spectrum access between governments and civil society might
prove to be more effective than allowing dual access to the same
spectrum portions. **NATO** should take **advantage** of **its
prerogative** as a **multinational coordinating body** to facilitate
**spectrum use standardization across the alliance**]{.underline}.

[Enhancing **interoperability** is]{.underline} perhaps [the most
important factor for 5G military]{.underline} application
[and will **depend** on **alliance-wide standardization**. As 5G allows
for more **connectivity** and **flexibility**]{.underline}, as well
as higher data volumes, [it]{.underline} also [enables **greater
dynamism** and **fluidity** of information flows
within **defense systems**. This can increase **warning times**, speed
of **decision-making**, and response times in crisis and pre-crisis
scenarios. The alliance should **capitalize** on this
**unprecedented potential for interconnectedness** to increase
**resilience** and expand the redundancy of systems.]{.underline}

Finally, [national governments must leverage **Western tech**nology and
regulatory diplomacy to create **international standards** for 5G
technology to ensure its governance is
not monopolized by **adversaries**. This would]{.underline} also go a
long way to [enhanc]{.underline}ing [**interoperability** amongst allies
and instilling network resilience at the **heart** of 5G
development. The]{.underline} formalization of [regulatory frameworks for
5G was]{.underline} recently [emphasized in a UK House of Commons
Science and Technology Committee report, which labeled it
**essential** if NATO members hope to retain **technological
influence**]{.underline}. Thus, [**international regulatory
agreements** will become increasingly important to ensure a democratic
digital domain not dominated by autocratic powers]{.underline}.

[**Integrating** these factors into 5G]{.underline}
technology [development better positions
NATO to realize the **potential** of
**EDTs** and to improve the **resilience** of these systems to
disruption. This should be reflected in]{.underline}
the short-term in [NATO allies' approach to building 5G digital
backbones. The alliance]{.underline} also [cannot lose sight
of]{.underline} the risks associated with military 5G
implementation. Not only are temporary measures needed to implement 5G
technology securely, but Western allies must have
[the long-term strategic foresight]{.underline} to lead the way [in
the development of **6G** and **quantum tech**nology]{.underline}, which
will eventually replace 5G.

The recent NATO communique from the Brussels Summit promises meaningful
contributions in this regard, via the civil-military Defense Innovation
Accelerator and NATO Innovation Fund. Though it will be years before
we can gauge the success of these measures, [**internal collaboration**
with]{.underline} industry [experts]{.underline} across the private
sector, [as well as **cross-border coordination** with allies to outline
governing and operational frameworks, will
be **essential**]{.underline}.

5\. [RECOMMENDATIONS FOR **NATO**'S]{.underline} SUPPORT TO GLOBAL [5G
**SECURITY COOPERATION**]{.underline}

A. International Partnership for Risk Assessment and Product Testing

[Countries **must** conduct a **risk assessment** of their security
processes and adopt]{.underline} advanced [**security measures** to
ensure]{.underline} the [successful **deployment** of 5G. A consortium
of **NATO** nations]{.underline} and its strategic partners [working
together to develop cyber **risk management policies** for 5G systems is
paramount]{.underline}. For example, [the EU toolbox for 5G
security]{.underline} (NIS Cooperation Group, 2020) has
[provided]{.underline} member states with [the opportunity to conduct a
**gap analysis** and launch **new initiatives** to improve existing
security measures]{.underline} and enforcement mechanisms. [The
toolbox]{.underline} has [aided]{.underline} a systematic
[self-assessment and has resulted in]{.underline} several member [states
being **prepared to adopt** advanced security measures on 5G **cyber
security**]{.underline}. This initiative should be expanded to and
adopted by non-EU NATO nations.

[NATO and]{.underline} the [Allies must]{.underline} each [develop a
**strategy** to ensure **security by design** for 5G beyond
infrastructure deployment. This should include a **rigorous process**
for vetting **vendors** and **carriers**]{.underline} of such networks.
[This process should be laid out by an **international consortium** of
industry and government stakeholders, including the NATO Standardization
Office]{.underline} (**[NSO]{.underline}**) and other entities such as
relevant Centres for Excellence that would look at balancing risk
mitigation and security. [The consortium should explore approaches to
**establishing** and **maintaining** situational awareness over **5G
supply chains** and **security practices** of suppliers and vendors.
This organisation would ensure]{.underline} that [5G products comply
with security specifications]{.underline} provided by the 3GPP and other
key standardisation bodies. [It should also develop a **framework** for
**assessment**, **mitigation** and **management** of the range of
risks]{.underline} to 5G networks. [This includes developing **testing
tools** for **automated evaluation** of the security of 5G networks;
**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence solutions that rely on **shared data**
are **promising candidates**]{.underline} for this. Finally, [the
consortium should incentivise **improvements** in **security** with
initiatives such as (i) easy access to **license-free** or
**lightly-licensed** spectrum to incentivise **innovation**: (ii)
incentives for **shared accountability** in the **supply chain** that
results in access to **trustworthy** hardware and software:
and]{.underline} (iii) [investigation of **new business models** that
incentivise **manufacturers** and **operators** that meet **security
benchmarks**]{.underline}.

As industries race towards deploying 5G networks in operational
settings, there is a need to conduct a security analysis of the 5G
infrastructure in diverse domain areas. Universities can play a key role
in conducting security risk assessments with the potential to uncover
exploitable vulnerabilities that could affect the resilience of the 5G
infrastructure. Collaboration between research groups in North American
and European universities can lead to an international research testbed
on which to conduct empirical validation of innovative security
technologies.

B. Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing

5G security cannot be under the exclusive purview of technical teams.
[When a **cyber threat** emerges, it is generally **detected** first by
**private actors** or]{.underline} by [the **public**]{.underline}.
Therefore, [for organisations to be swift]{.underline} in responding to
a cyber threat [requires the **fast sharing** of relevant
information]{.underline} by those actors. [This can be accomplished
through an Information Sharing and Analysis Centre]{.underline}
(**[ISAC]{.underline}**) (ENISA, 2018). [The problem is]{.underline}
thus to [develop a cyber-threat **information sharing** capability
allowing **authorised participants** to share **real-time** Cyber Threat
Information]{.underline} (**[CTI]{.underline}**) within an ISAC. [That
capability]{.underline} also [has to ensure **trust**, **anonymity** and
**security** to **all users** both inside and outside]{.underline} the
ISAC. The significance of cyber security information sharing has led
governments and regulators to mandate or encourage such sharing.

In the US, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (US Congress, 2015)
incentivises collaborative sharing among private- and public-sector
organisations by providing liability protection to the sharing parties.
The EU has also launched several cross- and intra-sector initiatives to
enhance member states' capability for preparedness, cooperation,
information exchange, coordination and response to cyber threats. ITU-T
recommendation X.1215 also discusses how structured threat information
expression (STIX) language can be used to support CTI and information
sharing, such as knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, risks
and mitigations and their associated remedies (ITU-T, 2019). [To ensure
a **successful** CTI capability, there]{.underline} is also a [need for
a **large number** of participants who **actively share** cyber
incidents. Limited participation in]{.underline} this [**information
sharing** can significantly impair the ability to manage cyber
risks]{.underline}. For example, the DHS has reported that the
[limited]{.underline} number of [participants that ingest]{.underline}
cyber [threat information is the **main barrier** to improving the
**quality of indicators** that can provide **actionable information** to
remediate cyber threats]{.underline} (Office of the Inspector General of
the Intelligence Community, 2019).

The [fundamental concerns]{.underline} of low participation [in CTI
sharing include lack of **trustworthiness**]{.underline} from the
participating organisations, [uncertain **authenticity** of]{.underline}
the exchanged [information, improper **anonymity**]{.underline}, the
[existence of **free-riders**, malicious **insiders** and the
possibility of **information tampering**. Blockchain]{.underline}
technology [should be investigated for its potential for **transparent**
and **trusted** information exchange]{.underline} that would give
provenance for vendors' and suppliers' actions. An example of
blockchain's use for information sharing has been demonstrated by IBM's
Mission Partner Environment (MPE) (IBM, 2018). The MPE is empowered by
blockchain private channels that allow the exchange of unclassified
information between unclassified and classified networks. The MPE
facilitates multinational information sharing and ensures the number and
size of each shared MPE are essentially reduced to ledger. The shared
private channel ledger capability lowers implementation costs through
the reuse of existing MPE resources, increases sharing by enabling
countries to use their indigenous technologies and provides
accountability via immutable ledger and fine-grained lifecycle security
control.

C. Expansion of Standardisation to the 5G Ecosystem

There will be a need for several standardisation efforts focused on
secure 5G infrastructure and secure 5G-enabled use cases. Although 3GPP
provides 5G infrastructure security specifications, there is a need for
additional standard bodies at the intersection of 5G and technologies
such as blockchain, IoT and autonomy. [**P**ublic-**p**rivate
**p**artnerships can]{.underline} be leveraged to [develop **de facto
standards** and promote **best practices** for 5G security]{.underline}
implementation [and 5G secure supply chains that other **countries**
may]{.underline} come to [adopt]{.underline}.

These efforts will benefit from government funding focused on realising:
(i) standards-compliant network stacks for 5G and beyond that are
opensource and secure by design to encourage the decoupling of the
software and hardware ecosystems of 5G; these, in turn, will mitigate
the threat posed by supply-chain attacks and promote 5G vendor
diversification and market competition; (ii) innovation support for
start-up companies; (iii) international collaboration and partnerships
that create joint academic and research programmes centred on 5G; (iv)
participation in standards bodies responsible for 5G and related
technologies; and (v) exchange programs among leading research
universities in NATO nations and its strategic partners such as
South-Korea, Japan and Australia.

6\. CONCLUSION

There is widespread awareness by governments and industry of the great
potential for economic development that comes with 5G and of the new
security vulnerabilities that come with it. [More than in previous
generations of mobile]{.underline} systems, [there is]{.underline} also
[open discussion of]{.underline} the **[geopolitical
factors]{.underline}** in play. [Specific concerns about **security**
and **privacy**]{.underline} in the context [of]{.underline} major
[Chinese 5G vendors]{.underline} have [led to widely publicised
discussions between US]{.underline} national [security officials
and]{.underline} their [counterparts]{.underline} in allied nations.

The defence and national [security apparatuses in many
countries]{.underline} are grappling with how they can adopt 5G as part
of their own critical communications infrastructure. In doing that, they
[face questions including **military** and **civilian**
spectrum-sharing, adoption of **open source implementation** and
securing the **supply chain**. It is appropriate]{.underline},
therefore, [that **NATO** plays a role in **5G innovation** and
**security by design**, in **sharing** of 5G **threat intelligence** and
in]{.underline} the [**certification** of 5G security
solutions]{.underline}.

We argue that [increased **cooperation** among NATO]{.underline} nations
and its strategic partners [is **vital** to effectively face the **new
challenges** brought by 5G. A role for NATO]{.underline} in [serving as
a **forum for collaboration** in 5G security]{.underline} across the
Atlantic [and expanding that collaboration through]{.underline} its
[**diplomatic dialogues** has]{.underline} also [been recently
advocated]{.underline} by others (Chivot and Jorge-Ricart, 2020). [The
**development** of a common 5G security strategy]{.underline} across the
Atlantic [would be the **critical first step**]{.underline} towards
implementing the recommendations in this chapter. [A common
strategy]{.underline}, with buy-in from key stakeholders in government
and industry, [could lead to the **creation** of **joint
research**]{.underline} programmes, [harmonised **spectrum allocation**,
a united front on the development of **standards** and **incentives** to
accelerate **i**ntellectual **p**roperty and **innovation**. 6G is
already starting to be discussed: to **regain** the **leadership** in 5G
and its successors, NATO nations]{.underline} will [need to incentivise
close collaboration between]{.underline} academic [researchers, relevant
NATO **Centres of Excellence**, NATO entities]{.underline}, private
industry [and regulators in NATO nations]{.underline} working together
towards a common goal. Modest funding by the European Commission exists
for international research collaboration in 5G, but this would need to
be increased significantly with coordinated participation from funding
agencies across the Atlantic to achieve the level of effect that we
advocate in this article.

Such a [joint strategy could]{.underline} also [lead to more
**effective** and **coordinated** participation by NATO
nations]{.underline} and non-NATO EU member states [in the
standardisation of 5G and subsequent generations. It could]{.underline}
also [affect the **adoption** and **success** of new technologies, like
**open source initiatives** for]{.underline} the [5G radio
access]{.underline} network being championed by the O-RAN Alliance
(2020) [that]{.underline} can [have a **profound impact** on the
**supply chain** of these future networks]{.underline}.

#### Alliance-wide NATO standardization develops [common guidelines]{.underline} and [security standards]{.underline} for 5G networks and applications.

6\. Recommendations

It is essential in cybersecurity management that security comes first in
relation to people, processes, and technologies. This requires specific
operational technology, cybersecurity practices, and adapted design
characteristic of the solutions. [By **2030**, it is expected that **5G
roll-out** will be **widespread** and many new use cases will have
emerged. Even if many industries see no potential in 5G applications,
**5G networks** will **revolutionise** our society, including the way we
move **military assets**. Even though **military movement** will likely
maintain a **low level** of adoption of **direct use** of 5G technology
-- **automation** and seamless **data integration** will still increase
the **speed**, **efficiency**, and **observability** aspects of asset
movements, and **decrease maintenance costs** and **environmental
impact**]{.underline}. But [if **NATO** member country militaries rely
on civil third-party contractors]{.underline} for the movement of
assets, [the change towards 5G based solutions **will happen** one way
or the other because **civilian use cases** will **surpass** the
military with their level of 5G]{.underline} technology
[adoption]{.underline}. With these developments, [major **cybersecurity
challenges** will arise, and the **value chain** needs to take that into
account]{.underline}.

6.1 Policies and Standards

[Military and policymakers need to be **knowledgeable** about the
**possibilities** of technology, including what **5G** provides for
**military movement** in the pursuit of **closer cooperation** on
**policies** and **standards**. NATO will need to **address** the
**potential vulnerabilities** of the new generation networks with a
**specific goal** to assure that **next generation** networks will be
**secure**. To ensure the **interoperability** and **cyber safety** of
military-related use cases, NATO]{.underline} and EU member states
[should adopt policies and standards that are **harmonised between
countries** related to approval and auditing of available hardware and
software solutions used in private 5G networks]{.underline}. However, as
NATO has no direct power over creating regulations and standards,
certain favourable guidelines should be created directed towards member
countries to implement within the jurisdiction of the National
Regulative Authorities. As the created 5G network should be end-to-end
secure by design, following internationally set standards, it is
advisable that NATO jointly with EU authorities evaluate the feasibility
of creation/use of trusted (virtual) mobile network operators for
military transportation operations. As the big MNOs that are responsible
for public 5G networks have considerable power over respective agencies
and institutions responsible for creating the standards, [NATO should be
in **close cooperation** with **different authorities** and
**MNOs**]{.underline}. It is feasible to develop European scale
technical and legal solutions together with MNOs for on-demand
deactivating of certain vulnerable ITS services during military
movements. The specific vulnerabilities and risk levels must be
identified through specific analysis and studies, possibly within EU
research and development projects. All risks related to the
implementation need to be considered from the start of the use case
development phase. Even though the military is more conservative
regarding changes to culture and operational practice compared to the
commercial sector, technological developments will inevitably reach the
operational phase.

6.2 System Security

[To **mitigate risks** related to 5G system security, the interested
parties, most notably NATO]{.underline} and EU member states, [must be
**proactive** in **planning**, be engaged in **commercial development**,
as well as be stringent in **monitoring** and
**enforcement**]{.underline}. These aims can be achieved through the
following three recommendations:

DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE 5G CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY \| [As the
**military** will interact with the rapidly developing **5G ecosystem**,
NATO will have to develop a **comprehensive cybersecurity strategy** by
mapping out the various forms of **interactions**, **corresponding
risks**, and **adequate responses**. In the strategy, all **military
movement** needs must be **identified**, infrastructure enabling the
movement must be **mapped** and its technological composition evaluated.
Based on that mapping, all the **opportunities** and **risks** related
to the intersection of future military movement and **5G development**
should be highlighted with **recommendations** developed by **military**
and **technological experts**. The strategy would facilitate making
**Alliance-wide strategic decisions** regarding **5G-use**, including
recommendations to private 5G **network owners** and intelligent
transportation **system providers**. Given that **security management**
will become **essential** in handling ongoing **threats** and **risks**,
a proactive plan for the **security management** cannot be developed
before a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is in place]{.underline}.

ENGAGE IN BUILDING SECURE SYSTEMS AND 5G NETWORKS FROM THE BEGINNING \|
[The commercial 5G systems that the military will interact with in the
future are being built now. It is **imperative** that these systems and
5G networks are being **built** in a **secure manner** from the
**start**. NATO]{.underline}, in close cooperation with the EU member
countries and their regulative authorities, [should take a **proactive
stance** in the **development process** and strongly **recommend certain
guidelines** to its **commercial partners** regarding the
military-related security needs both for **vendors** and **MNOs**.
Shaping the **development process** to **security priorities** as it
happens is more convenient and cheaper than coming up with risk
management measures retrospectively]{.underline} in a reactive manner.
For this, [it would be advisable to create a list of **security
approved** 5G RAN devices or vendors]{.underline} at a national or EU
level as it is possible industrial enterprises or even MNOs might not be
aware of possible security issues for specific hardware components.

ADOPT STRINGENT MONITORING AND SECURITY ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES \| When
fully operational, [all relevant parties need to run **frequent** and
**structured risk analysis** to assess the security of the systems and
to **avoid** any **potential risks** or **threats** that might
arise]{.underline}. Upon the installation or design of the system, the
underlying report can be used for auditing purposes if all the necessary
steps have been followed (see Chapter 5.3). [As **NATO** will be relying
mostly on the **private sector**, companies as **logistical partners**
are strongly advised to **follow policy recommendations** as
**collectively agreed** in NATO]{.underline} and in cooperation with the
EU. [For that, the NATO **Standardization Office** could be responsible
developing such requirements.]{.underline} The first step of which would
be to consider how the current 3GPP standards address the security
requirements of the military. [NATO Allies should **cooperate** in
**assessing** and **certifying** hardware and software **products**,
**processes**, and **services** associated with 5G technology according
to **jointly agreed criteria**, consider the **existing
certification**]{.underline} schemes, [and assess their **value** and
**sufficiency**.]{.underline} Upon the completion of the requirements,
[companies should be encouraged to **meet** a **set of standards** in
order to provide **any services** to NATO related **military movement**.
This also means that NATO should **provide the guidelines** to and
**lobby** national governments]{.underline} who will need to be active
in communicating and monitoring the fulfilment of these requirements.

6.3 Recommendations Related to Use Cases

[Based on]{.underline} the [case studies of **smart seaports** and
**road transportation**]{.underline} presented, the [5G-enabled use
cases carry both **increased opportunities** as well as **risks**.
Therefore, for each use case, the military **must**]{.underline} (in the
previously suggested cybersecurity strategy) [conduct a **systematic**
and **professional risk analysis** weighing]{.underline} the potential
[advantages]{.underline} of technology adoption [against]{.underline}
the [disadvantages]{.underline} of increased risk. The risk analysis
must conclude where the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, or the
upside is high enough to take on the downside risk. It is not predicted
that dedicated military vehicles will extensively interact over 5G
networks in given timeframe up until 2030. The [risks are related to
**services** provided by **civil infrastructure**]{.underline} -- both
at ports and on roads -- [and **contracted vehicles**]{.underline}.
Having said that, the current analysis concludes with the following
recommendations for supply chain security of the two case studies.

#### NATO standards maximize [upsides]{.underline} of commercial and military [5G applications]{.underline} while minimizing risk.

**Kertysova '21** \[Katarina; February 2021; Policy Fellow at the
European Leadership Network, Wilson Center Global Fellow, M.A. in French
and International Relations from the University of St. Andrews, M.A. in
International Security from Sciences Po Paris; et al.; \"When 5G Meets
AI: Next Generation of Communication and Information Sharing,\"
https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/when-5g-meets-ai-next-generation-of-communication-and-information-sharing/237\]

As this paper demonstrates, the [development of **5G** is a
**double-edged sword** for democratic societies]{.underline}. On the one
hand, [5G will enable greater **connectivity** and
**access**]{.underline} to information, which promises to improve
democratic participation, activism, and citizen mobilization. [On the
other hand, it can be used]{.underline} by governments [to tighten
**information control**, **repress political opponents**, and
**manipulate public opinion**. The technology itself is **inherently
neutral**; it is only what we, **users**, do with it that determines its
impact]{.underline}.

Though widespread adoption will not be realized for a few years, once
fully adopted, 5G will allow us to communicate ideas instantly, redefine
audience engagement, and deliver unprecedented targeting capabilities.
It will also change the way we interact with (political) advertising. 5G
will bring to life new applications and usages: moving communication
from a 2D to a 3D holographic format, enhancing video and voice calls,
AR and VR, and providing richer and more interactive experiences.
High-resolution audio and visual material will enable users to interact
in ways that 4G does not come close to.67

[5G has the potential to **fill the gaps** left unaddressed by previous
**technological revolutions**]{.underline}. The changes that come with
the implementation of 5G technology have the potential to considerably
accelerate machine-tomachine interaction, but it remains to be seen how
exactly it will impact human-to-human communication. While 5G is
unlikely to usher in another major communications revolution, it would
be naive to assume that nothing will change.68

[Especially regarding **disinformation** campaigns, 5G will not only
introduce **new risks** but also **aggravate** existing
ones]{.underline}. First, [a feature unique to 5G is its ability to
**collect** new kinds of **user data**]{.underline} (such as more
precise localization, biometric, and sensorial data), [which can be used
for more effective **user profiling** and]{.underline} (psychometric)
[**targeting** of those who are **most vulnerable**]{.underline} to
influence. Second, [5G-backed **AI capabilities** will make it possible
to **manipulate** audio-visual content in **real time**, making
**deepfakes** more convincing]{.underline}. At the same time, [because
of its **speed** and **connectivity**, 5G will **enhance** all the
**problems** we have been grappling with for the past
decade]{.underline}. Not just the news, but also disinformation that
journalists must sift through will travel faster and spread more widely
in the era of 5G. As put by the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard: '[the **weaponization of information**
through **speedier channels** could pose a **threat to knowledge** and
**information integrity**']{.underline}.69 If even more information
about a person's environment becomes accessible, [the potential for
misuse expands too]{.underline}. Problems caused by previous
technological breakthroughs plaguing social media today have not been
solved. 5G and AI are evolving at such a quick pace that existing
problems are likely to permeate, and intensify, in the 5G era.

Recommendations

1\. Address the potential for data misuse. [The first challenge lies in
ensuring]{.underline} that [**personal data** is **secure**]{.underline}
-- a challenge that is not unique to 5G networks. [This necessitates
both **technological** and **regulatory solutions**]{.underline}. On the
technological side, privacy by design solutions and disclosure measures,
i.e. getting companies to disclose how personal data is collected and
what it is being used for, could minimize the risk of data misuse. On
the regulatory side, [improved **law enforcement** in 5G networks and
adequate **state policies** that set out requirements for privacy
regulations are needed]{.underline}. Such [national **strategies** and
**policies** should be **harmonized** across the Alliance. As tech
companies]{.underline} such as Meta (previously Facebook), which have
come under intense scrutiny for the mishandling of user data, [turn to
5G to roll out new applications, it is crucial to promote **greater
accountability** and address existing issues surrounding **algorithmic
transparency**]{.underline}. In addressing these challenges,
[governments should ensure]{.underline} that [regulation does not
inhibit innovation and that democratic societies are **not outpaced** by
their **adversaries** when it comes to technological
advancement]{.underline}.

2\. Address supply chain and network security issues. [Modern
**militaries** are going to become **increasingly reliant** on 5G for
a]{.underline} wide [variety of capabilities, from **situational
awareness**, through military]{.underline} command and control
(**[C2]{.underline}**) [and **communications**, to **logistics**. As
connected devices proliferate, **cybersecurity** and **resilience** of
5G networks are **crucial**. Software supply chain efforts can address
**open-source vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. To ensure the integrity of
supply chains, technology vendors are increasingly adopting a zero trust
network design. In May 2021, the Biden administration issued an
executive order on zero trust architecture.70 While disruptive for
companies, this [authentication]{.underline} system [makes cyberattacks
much less effective. Another important step]{.underline} in this regard
[was]{.underline} the [adoption of the EU Toolbox for 5G
Security]{.underline} in January 2020, which allows only 'trusted
suppliers' into EU member states' networks. [On the **procurement**
side, it would be prudent for **NATO** to investigate the technologies
that are being used in its **systems** and the **civilian
infrastructure** that the military relies on, as well as their
**origins**]{.underline}. To that end, [NATO should develop **common
criteria** to evaluate the **trustworthiness** of 5G **vendors**,
**technology**, and **infrastructure**]{.underline}.

3\. Adopt cyber and technology standards. [With a long and **successful
track record** as a **standard-setter**, NATO should be at the
**forefront** of developing an **ethical framework** to
drive]{.underline} the [**development** and **implementation** of
**e**merging and **d**isruptive **t**echnologies, including
**5G**]{.underline} and AI.71 [This would help offset China taking the
lead in global standard setting. NATO recently launched an **AI
strategy**]{.underline} which will set ethical guidelines [around how to
govern AI systems, and]{.underline} it [is]{.underline} also [exploring
the **potential** of 5G for **military applications**]{.underline}.72
[NATO's **baseline requirements**]{.underline} for resilience already
[cover telecommunications, but Alliance-wide **military-grade criteria**
to secure public and private 5G networks are yet to be
developed]{.underline}.73 To avoid duplication of effort, [as a first
step, NATO should take stock of what already exists and **collaborate**
with Allied standard-setting bodies. Even with non-Chinese suppliers,
the **armed forces** of NATO **member states** will largely rely on
**networks** and **equipment** that are available **commercially**,
which presents **additional risks** and **vulnerabilities**. Security
requirements for **military communications**, such as the need to avoid
being **geo-localized** and **jammed** by an adversary, exceed those
offered by commercial 5G service providers]{.underline}, which have
different security concerns and needs.74 [In addition to **setting
standards** and **technical specifications**, Allied militaries
should]{.underline} strive to [secure high quality support and
engineering, and **closely cooperate** with the **industry** to
ensure]{.underline} that [military-specific requirements]{.underline}
are taken into consideration.

1\. INTRODUCTION

If any doubt remained about communication networks making up a key
component of our critical infrastructure, the COVID-19 crisis has put it
to rest. [With the increased role]{.underline} that these [**networks**
play in keeping the **economy** going, new threats have emerged and
existing ones intensified.]{.underline} For example, the healthcare
industry has been experiencing a surge in ransomware attacks, with an
increase of 350 per cent reported for the last quarter of 2019, a trend
that has only worsened in 2020 (Corvus Insurance, 2020). [With **5G
networks** starting to be **deployed** worldwide, there is **justified
concern** about new **cyber threats** associated with this
**technology**]{.underline}.

[The introduction of any **network technology** creates the potential
for **new security attacks**, but]{.underline} in some respects [**5G is
different**. It builds on **previous generations**]{.underline} of
cellular technology [by improving]{.underline} the [**bandwidth**,
**capacity**, **latency** and **reliability** of mobile broadband
services]{.underline}. With its promise to enable a new generation of
services through ultra-reliable low-latency communications, [5G can also
significantly **expand** the **attack surface** of the
network]{.underline} (Frost and Sullivan, 2020). If applications such as
smart homes and blended autonomous vehicles depend on 5G, [an attack on
the **network** can have **safety-of-life** consequences. The apparent
dominance of **Chinese** vendors in the **5G space** has]{.underline}
also [raised questions in the US and elsewhere about]{.underline} the
level of [**independence** of vendors from]{.underline} national
[governments]{.underline} (Iplytics, 2019).

[Addressing both **technical** and **geopolitical** challenges in 5G
security will require strong **international cooperation** that goes
beyond]{.underline} the [standardisation]{.underline} process [that
already takes place in the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project]{.underline} (**[3GPP]{.underline}**) [and other **standards
bodies**]{.underline}. We believe that [this **must** include the
development of **international benchmarks** for **5G security** and a
**certification** process for **hardware** and **software** to pass
stringent security tests]{.underline}. Recent strides in artificial
intelligence can be leveraged for the creation of automated tools to
check for security vulnerabilities.

[The **core principles** for 5G security can **benefit strongly** from
international consensus and **NATO**]{.underline} member states [can
have a role in **establishing** the **mechanisms** for this consensus to
emerge. Relevant metrics should be **identified** and **tracked**
through an international 5G cyber security-focused Information Sharing
and Analysis Centre]{.underline} (**[ISAC]{.underline}**). [An open
**vulnerabilities database** should be created]{.underline}, thereby
[increasing **transparency** and affording industry, government and
academic stakeholders]{.underline} access to [**shared information** on
those **security threats** plaguing]{.underline} the [5G]{.underline}
infrastructure.

The [geopolitical issues in the **supply chain** for 5G networks also
require a **coordinated approach**]{.underline}. The open radio access
network concept and, more broadly, the reliance upon [5G systems that
are **open by design**, will encourage the **disaggregation** of those
**software** and **hardware**]{.underline} ecosystems associated with
5G. [This process has the potential to **mitigate the threat** posed by
supply chain attacks]{.underline} and promote a diversification of 5G
vendors.

[The]{.underline} broad [problem of **cyber security** in 5G can
**only** be handled adequately through **coordination**]{.underline}
between researchers, industry and policymakers from across the globe.
[With the **strategic role** that 5G is starting to play in **national
security** and **military organisations**, NATO is well placed to
**facilitate** this **coordination**.]{.underline} This article
summarises unique security aspects brought about by the advent of 5G and
presents recommendations for how the international community and NATO,
in particular, can respond to these challenges.

2\. 5G SECURITY: WHAT'S NEW?

The vision for [5G security includes **security by design**,
**flexibility** to respond to **new threats**, and **automated
security** systems leveraging **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline} (Ahmad et al., 2019). The International
Telecommunication Unit Telecommunication Standardisation Sector (ITU-T)
has a number of study groups involved in drafting security standards and
recommendations. These efforts are complemented by those of other
international standardisation bodies such as the 3GPP, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Nevertheless, some [unique concerns attach to the issue of security in
5G systems]{.underline}: a) the virtualisation of network functions and
resources; b) the 5G pillars of massive machine-type and ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (Sexton et al., 2017); and c) concerns about
the international supply chain for 5G equipment. These are summarised in
Figure I.

First, [softwarisation]{.underline}---that [is, moving
**functionality**]{.underline} that was [traditionally provided in
**hardware to software**]{.underline}---is [a **major trend** in
networks]{.underline} with the advent of Software Defined Network (SDN)
and Software Defined Radio (SDR) and the replacement of network-specific
hardware with white boxes. [In 5G, this]{.underline} trend [gains
additional steam through a concept called **slicing**. Network
virtualisation and slicing]{.underline} techniques [enable the running
of **multiple logical networks** as independent]{.underline} business
[operations on a common physical infrastructure]{.underline} (Afolabi et
al., 2018). In essence, [each network slice represents an
**independent** virtualised end-to-end network]{.underline} and allows
operators [to deploy **multiple services** with distinct
architectures]{.underline} in parallel [over the same physical
network]{.underline}. While [virtualisation and slicing]{.underline}
play a critical role in 5G systems, they also [introduce potential
**security vulnerabilities** due to the challenge of]{.underline}
simultaneously [providing strong **resource isolation** and **efficient
resource use**]{.underline} in a virtualised environment. [Exploiting
the shared physical platforms]{.underline} in 5G infrastructure,
[**adversaries** could construct **side channels** or **covert
channels** to impose serious **security threats** on 5G
communications]{.underline}. Thus, [it is **essential** to protect the
**slice-provisioning** process]{.underline} in 5G infrastructures
[against **malicious attacks**]{.underline} and to ensure strong slice
isolation.

Second, the [specifications for 5G]{.underline} are built on three
pillars: enhanced mobile broadband; [Massive Machine Type
Communications]{.underline} (**[MMTC]{.underline}**); [and
Ultra-Reliable Low Latency]{.underline} (**[URLL]{.underline}**)
communications. The last two [present a **paradigm shift** for wireless
networks in]{.underline} terms of [the **need to scale**
massively]{.underline} (in the case of MMTC) [and in the support of
stringent **reliability requirements**]{.underline} (for URLL). [They
also **expand** the **attack surface** of the network to a **new** class
of **devices**---sensors and Cyber Physical Systems (**CPSs**)---and
services from]{.underline} autonomous transportation to Augmented and
Virtual Reality (**[AR/VR]{.underline}**). Attacks on those services can
present safety-of-life risks: imagine, for example, a hacker taking
control of an autonomous vehicle.

[The third]{.underline} area of specific [concern in 5G relates
to]{.underline} the [**reliability** and **trustworthiness** of the
supply chain]{.underline} for those networks. [Huawei]{.underline}
Technologies [currently leads in the number of]{.underline} declared [5G
patent families]{.underline} (Iplytics, 2019), followed by Samsung and
LG Electronics. [Among the top ten]{.underline} companies in this
category, [only two are]{.underline} based [in Europe]{.underline}
(Nokia and Ericsson, in fourth and sixth positions, respectively) [and
two in the US]{.underline} (Qualcomm and Intel, in seventh and eighth,
respectively). The geopolitics of 5G have dominated the news of late,
with the US exerting pressure on its allies to not deploy 5G testbeds
based on Huawei equipment. [Concerns are around a **close relationship**
between the **vendor** and the Chinese **government**, with]{.underline}
the potential for [privacy and security violations]{.underline} (Kaska
et al., 2019).

The softwarisation and virtualisation of 5G, including the introduction
of service orientation in the 5G ecosystem, bring advantages and
disadvantages. The 5G architecture introduces mobile edge computing (Liu
et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2017) as a key component of its architecture
that will enable faster and diverse services for new use-cases such as
e-health or connected autonomous vehicles. However, [virtualised
service-oriented architectures have a **long history** of
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline} (Riaz & Tahir, 2018; Tank et al.,
2019), [kill chains]{.underline} (Kim et al., 2019; MITRE, 2020) [and
post-attack forensics]{.underline} (Sharevski, 2018). In addition, the
[newer application domains]{.underline} may [connect]{.underline} their
[specialised equipment]{.underline} and controllers [to 5G base
stations. This makes **vulnerability tracking** and associated **risk
evaluation**]{.underline} and post-attack forensic examinations [more
complex and]{.underline} issues such as supply chain security and
[attack attribution more challenging]{.underline}.

The deployment of 5G services will involve re-architecting the wireless
cellular network with new capabilities such as software-defined
networking, network function virtualisation and a cloud-native
architecture. These enhancements bring the need for cyber defence in the
edge, secure network slicing, secure multi-access edge computing and
access control policies for a disaggregated radio access network.

In the next two sections, we propose a number of actions that can be
taken to address these challenges and how **[NATO]{.underline}**,
together with the broader international community, [can establish
**tighter collaboration** in **identifying** and **overcoming** the
security threats that]{.underline} may [arise with this new
technology]{.underline}.

## Say No

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--2AC

#### Consensus [possible]{.underline} and [necessary]{.underline} for NATO operations.

**Gorman '19** \[Lindsay; 12/3/19; Fellow for Emerging Technologies at
the Alliance for Securing Democracy, M.S. in Applied Physics from
Stanford University; \"NATO Should Count Spending on Secure 5G Towards
Its 2% Goals,\"
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/12/nato-should-count-secure-5g-spending-towards-its-2-goals/161648/\]

The agenda at NATO's London summit reportedly includes talk about the
future of internet security --- that is, establishing rules and roles
for next-generation 5G gear. This is both a vital issue and a
bellwether. If done right, moving to secure 5G systems can rejuvenate
the alliance around its central mission: protecting democratic states
from authoritarian incursion. Botch it, and the rift will only increase.

[Whether NATO **comes together** or **falls apart** over 5G presents an
**initial test** of how it will handle China's rise. For Beijing,
leapfrogging Western telecommunications]{.underline} firms [is
part]{.underline} and parcel [of a vision to spread **norms** of
authoritarian **internet governance**, promote **surveillance**
technologies, build **global dependencies**, and undermine the liberal
democratic order NATO anchors]{.underline}. U.S. officials can take
several steps to help move the debate from admonition to action.

First, NATO should allow members to count a portion of outlays on secure
5G systems towards national 2-percent defense spending goals. There are
a number of ways 5G-inclusive targets could be defined, including
one-time commitments or line-item funds, but if investing in technology
built by trustworthy vendors is a priority for the United States---and
it should be---the alliance's cost-sharing structure should reflect it.

Second, [NATO should conduct **thorough** technical and political **risk
assessments** on 5G networks and build **shared cybersecurity
standards**]{.underline}. Last month, NATO announced plans to update
rules for civilian 5G. [The **U**nited **S**tates should use this
process to **push** for **transparency requirements** on the
**companies** that build **5G networks**, including **disclosures** on
corporate **ownership** structures, direct **government funding**, and
**state influence**]{.underline} and control. [Whether an authoritarian
government subsidizes telecommunications]{.underline} equipment to
undercut local competitors---[or controls a company to steal military,
commercial, or personal data---is relevant when considering allowing it
to build]{.underline} the foundations of economic opportunity [for
**NATO**]{.underline} member [states]{.underline}.

Put simply, [NATO should require participating suppliers to show
**credible independence** from foreign governments]{.underline}. In
addition to helping secure networks, [such a requirement fosters
**internet governance** that resists **authoritarian surveillance** and
erects barriers to the **unfettered access** of private citizen
data]{.underline}.

Third, the United States should urge its allies to consider cooperative
business models and infrastructure sharing arrangements that would help
member countries choose trusted-yet-costlier systems over cheaper
alternatives. Some creativity may be in order here, but NATO
partnerships with the EU, Finland, and Sweden could build joint funding
and research models for secure 5G and even 6G systems.

Proposing these initiatives would add constructive action to the U.S.
government's steady drumbeat against Huawei. Concerns over Chinese-made
5G have centered on espionage, but extend to amassing sensitive personal
and corporate information and leveraging internet dependence for
geopolitical control. In capital after capital, U.S. diplomats have
warned allies and called for outright bans.

[For]{.underline} the rest of [**NATO**, these **concrete steps**
are]{.underline} also more [politically viable. Amid divisions within
allied nations over 5G]{.underline} and ample pressure from China, [a
tenuous "plausible deniability" **consensus** may emerge: to ratchet up
**requirements** without singling out one **country** or **company**.
A]{.underline} recent [**E**uropean **U**nion risk assessment on
5G]{.underline}, for example, [notably cautioned against threats from
state actors]{.underline}, but stopped [short of naming China
explicitly]{.underline}.

[Disunity here has **real consequences**. A split over **cybersecurity**
and the]{.underline} varying [presence of "untrusted"
suppliers]{.underline} from China [in member countries' **5G networks**
threatens vital NATO **military** and **intelligence
cooperation**]{.underline}. The United States has already warned that it
will limit intelligence sharing if allies build 5G networks with Chinese
equipment. In the words of one official, "the Americans will assume that
everything we share with Germany will end up with the Chinese."

[Such an outcome would be **disastrous** for the **alliance**. A NATO
**intelligence-sharing rift** would open the door to greater
**authoritarian interference** in Western democracies]{.underline}, and
not just from China. [NATO's intelligence sharing and **threat analysis
cell** is a central tenet of its plan to combat **hybrid threats** from
Russia and others: **disinformation** campaigns, malign **financial
flows**]{.underline}, the annexation of Crimea, [and more]{.underline}.
Given Russia's long-standing goal of fracturing NATO, it's no
coincidence that Russian state media champions Huawei.

The illegal [Russian attack on the Ukraine moved NATO into the centre of
public attention as the freedom and security of its members is at
stake]{.underline}. [**China's rise** and its support for Russia,
although not as straightforward as expected, presents the alliance with
an additional new **challenge**.]{.underline} China seems to be no
longer "out of area". [Furthermore, Chinese **investment** into NATO
allies' critical **infrastructure**, its growing global **economic** and
**political** influence, the **modernisation** of its **military**, its
cyberattacks and participation in disinformation campaigns paired with
its ambition to build capabilities for global reach are all factors that
force NATO to deal with China within the alliance, as well as in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} This policy brief posits that NATO's
priorities should be, first, to forge consensus on key matters such as
investment screening and critical infrastructure resilience at home,
and, second, to consider how it can play a role in the IndoPacific.

The challenges that China poses to NATO

At the Madrid Summit in 2022, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
will define its core tasks and priorities for the 21st century. While
NATO is expected to increase its attention to the Pacific, the war in
the Ukraine will have an impact. Nevertheless, [there is a growing
unease within the alliance about China's rise, economically and
politically, impacting on NATO]{.underline} and on its partner countries
in the Indo Pacific region.

The greater focus on China in the Strategic Concept has been under
discussion within NATO and with allies since the mid 2000s.
Military-to-military cooperation with the People's Liberation Army began
in 2007. In 2011, then-secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen supported
engagement with China: He saw China, as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, playing an increasingly important role on the global
stage, also as a partner for the alliance to achieve peace and
stability.

Ahead of the North Atlantic Council at the level of heads of state
and/or government in 2019, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had
announced that the 2019 Summit Communique would mention China for the
first time in an official document -- the 1999 Strategic Concept had not
mentioned China -- The 2021 NATO Brussels Summit Communique, in which
the Alliance adopted its 2030 Agenda. Countering China's various
challenges to the alliance were the focus of the document as NATO seeks
to address "China \[...\] coming closer to \[the alliance\]".

In the non-binding 2030 Reflection Report, and in NATO's 2030 Agenda
adopted in 2021, NATO officially stated its intention to work more
alongside partners in the Indo-Pacific and tackle the political,
economic, and military challenges China poses. However, the vast
majority of these challenges fall within areas that are not
traditionally NATO's responsibility.

[The 2030 Agenda highlights China's military modernisation and to the
creation of new capabilities in the **cyber**, **space**, **maritime**,
and **air** domains.]{.underline} NATO voiced particular apprehension
about China's development of nuclear-capable systems, which are able to
reach NATO countries, and about Xi Jinping's government expanding its
arsenal with "more warheads and a more sophisticated delivery system in
an unrestricted manner". This adds another nuclear threat to NATO beyond
the traditional threat posed by Russia, which President Putin has
recently raised when attacking Ukraine.

[Though China has not used force against NATO, it "has proven its
willingness to use force against its neighbours". Consequently, NATO has
to factor in China's development of longer-range, more advanced, and
larger arsenals when planning its own **nuclear
deterrence**.]{.underline} [The military cooperation between Russia and
China poses additional concerns, as evidenced in the Ukraine
War]{.underline} as well as by earlier joint-military drills in Russia
and in the Euro-Atlantic region.

The 2030 Agenda is not limited to military considerations but identifies
a broad range of challenges that China poses to the rules-based
international order through its approach to human rights and
international law. [It identifies China's use of economic coercion and
intimidatory diplomacy,]{.underline} as well as disinformation efforts,
as challenges to NATO's unity, its collective resilience, [the security
of critical infrastructure (such as 5G]{.underline}), supply chains, and
its ability to maintain an innovative edge in new technologies.

NATO places increasing importance on the development and adoption of
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous weapons
systems, biotechnology, quantum computing. Therefore, the protection of
intellectual property rights and innovation in the academic and private
sector have gained importance.

[**5G**, where China made important inroads in the European critical
infrastructure and digital ecosystems, is a **particularly grave concern
for NATO**]{.underline}. The United States, supported by some allies,
regards the integration of Chinese-built 5G networks across the alliance
as a significant intelligence and operational risk. This could also
[endanger European innovation in strategic industries]{.underline}.
Companies like Huawei have close links with the Chinese Communist Party
and according to Chinese laws could be pressured to reveal information
about their overseas engagements. US officials contend that [any
information flowing through Chinese 5G networks could be compromised
through Beijing's use of backdoors built into the code of the
technology.]{.underline}

In the economic sphere, the Reflection Report contends, [NATO Allies
will continue to diverge as governments attempt to strike a balance
between the need for security]{.underline} and the desire for economic
benefits through access to the Chinese market. While the 2030 Agenda
underscores the need for unity within the alliance, the Reflection
[Report highlighted that political unity across the alliance is at
present still a 'work in progress']{.underline} on how to address future
challenges, including national economic interests. As the report warns,
China will continue to exploit this division among allies in its own
interests.

risk of 5G equipment supplied by vendors with connections to foreign
adversaries, namely Huawei and ZTE, before buying.

"I think [we're setting a very strong example together here

pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used
by Beijing for spying.

The Belgian capital Brussels is home to the NATO alliance and the
European Union's executive and parliament, making it a matter of
particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies.

"Belgium has been 100% reliant on Chinese vendors for its radio
networks - and people working at NATO and the EU were making mobile
phone calls on these networks," said John Strand, an independent Danish
telecoms consultant.

privacy, security, and human rights posed to the free world from
authoritarian malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party".

"[Bulgaria is in a good company]{.underline}. As a member of the NATO
Alliance it now joins 27 of the 30 NATO member states as a member of the
Clean Network", said Keith Krach, U.S. undersecretary for economic
affairs in a video released by the Bulgarian government from the
signing.

The [U.S. embassy]{.underline} in Sofia called the signing "historic"
and [said Bulgaria was joining a "**growing coalition** of countries and
companies committed to protecting their 5G networks from untrusted
vendors".]{.underline}

[Washington has been **alarmed** by Beijing's dominance in the 5G
infrastructure market and has pressed its allies to exclude China's
Huawei Technologies]{.underline}.

Bulgarian [Prime Minister]{.underline} Boyko [Borissov said]{.underline}
the European Union has already provided guidelines on [5G
network]{.underline} security and that they [should be built on fair
competition and transparency]{.underline}.

The government's statement did not mention any specific vendors or what
the document would mean for Bulgarian telecoms operators that will
develop the 5G networks.

But Bulgarian business newspaper Kapital quoted Krach as saying the main
idea of the initiative was to ensure the Bulgarian telecoms operators
will use trusted vendors and would not choose Huawei and ZTE.

Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said the government would table
legislation to protect critical infrastructure in the finance,
telecommunications, energy and transport sectors.

Fen Hampson, a professor of international affairs at Carleton

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Czechia

#### Czechia wants more 5G security cooperation in NATO.

the Czech Republic, 5/7/2020, \"National Cyber and Information Security
Agency,\" No Publication,

RMax

On May 6, 2020, [Czech Prime Minister]{.underline} Andrej [Babiš
and]{.underline} US [Secretary of State]{.underline} Mike [Pompeo signed
the **Mutual Declaration** on **5G Network Security** that included the
goals of working together to increase the security of]{.underline}
future [**fifth generation networks**; creating mechanisms
for]{.underline} finding [reliable and trustworthy suppliers of software
and hardware; protecting communication networks]{.underline} from
possible violations and manipulation; [and]{.underline} especially [to
provide citizens with protection of their privacy and individual
rights]{.underline}.

As [**both leaders** said, future 5G networks will allow for
unprecedented development of new services and technologies,
but]{.underline} they [will also offer services **necessary** for the
**operation of states** and often for the protection of the lives and
health of inhabitants]{.underline}.

[The goal]{.underline} of the declaration [is to build 5G networks
**together** so they are protected from **unauthorized
access**]{.underline} and possible attack while also providing citizens
with protection of their privacy and basic rights.

"5G networks are not just a huge opportunity to develop and modernize
the economy and society, but also a series of security challenges. 5G
networks will be a global phenomenon, which is why [the state has to
cooperate with partners within]{.underline} the EU,
**[NATO]{.underline}**, and other organizations [in assuring
**security**]{.underline}. The signature of the Czech-US declaration
will greatly contribute to this goal just like last year's announcement
of the Prague Proposals or the European 5G Security Toolbox, which the
Czech Republic played a pivotal role preparing. I'm proud that thanks to
the NÚKIB's contribution, the Czech Republic is seen abroad as a
significant and respected partner in the area of cybersecurity," NÚKIB
Director Karel Řehka said.

The declaration is an extension of a number of documents that were
adopted at the European Union level. These include the 5G Security
Toolbox, which was adopted by the EU at the beginning of this year and
which the Czech Republic significantly contributed to. Another document
is the Prague Proposals announced at the Prague 5G Security Conference
that took place on May 2-3, 2019, in Prague under the auspices of Czech
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš. These documents, just like the newly-signed
declaration, emphasize the need to build and implement 5G networks based
on free and fair competition, transparency, and the rule of law.

According to the declaration, the following is especially important to
evaluate:

    Whether the supplier is not under excessive foreign influence
without the opportunity for independent legal review;

    Whether the supplier has a transparent ownership structure,
traceable commercial relationships, and a standard management structure;

    Whether the supplier commits to regularly innovating its products
and whether it respects intellectual property rights;

    Whether the hardware and software supplier acts in accordance with
ethical standards for corporate behaviour and whether they are part of a
legal environment that demands corporations behave transparently.

[Representatives of both]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} also
[declared the process]{.underline} of selecting trustworthy suppliers
will not only contribute to increased national security, but it
[is]{.underline} also [an opportunity for the **further development and
innovation** in the private sector]{.underline}. Both [countries also
expressed support for **further discussions** about the **security of 5G
networks within NATO.**]{.underline}

In late January, [the]{.underline} NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence [(**NATO CCDCOE**) launches an initiative focused on the
**security** of]{.underline} fifth generation [(**5G**)
telecommunications networks with the aim to analyse 5G security in the
context of **military mobility**. The]{.underline} international
[team]{.underline} at the CCDCOE [was awarded funding by]{.underline}
both [the US Department of Defence and]{.underline} the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of **[Estonia]{.underline}**, and its first stage spans
one year.

**[Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Urmas [Reinsalu said the security of
communications networks is]{.underline} not only a technical matter, but
also [a **strategic security issue**]{.underline}. "The CCDCOE´s 5G
project is the result of the work of Estonian diplomats and it gives an
opportunity to develop NATO's threat perception in the area of 5G
security and an understanding how potential risks can be mitigated and
prevented with technical standards for 5G and subsequent networks,"
Reinsalu said. "We are still at the start of the project but there is
potential for long-term cooperation between Estonia and the United
States on such a critical issue of the future."

Colonel Jaak Tarien, the Director of the CCDCOE, emphasised that [in the
**immediate future**, the **collective defence capabilities** of the
Alliance would be **increasingly reliant** on commercial communications
networks]{.underline}. "We do not want to be in a situation where the
military or peacetime deployment of NATO forces is vulnerable due to
insufficient security standards or malignant cyber activity," Tarien
added. "Thanks to our experience with engaging the private sector and
our international team that includes most NATO member states as well as
our partners from across the world, our centre is best placed to carry
out this crucial research."

One of the objectives of the project is to increase a common
understanding among NATO Allies and partners that mitigating the
security risks related to adopting 5G networks should be a part of
strategic dialogue on all political levels.

[5G security is an important area of]{.underline} bilateral
[**cooperation** between **Estonia** and the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. In October 2019, US Vice President Mike Pence

[Phone companies including Altice Europe NV's SFR unit and Bouygues
Telecom have begun removing Huawei]{.underline} Technologies
Co.'s [wireless equipment from]{.underline} large [**French cities**
after the government moved to **purge** the Chinese vendor from **all**
but isolated parts of the country]{.underline}.

The work started at the beginning of 2021, when [France's Constitutional
Council signed off on a ruling that forces carriers to **rip out Huawei
gear** in densely populated areas where networks are being upgraded to
**fifth-gen**eration wireless technology]{.underline}, according to
people familiar with the situation.

Unlike countries such as the U.K., [**France** is seeking]{.underline}
to strike a middle ground that would allow Huawei to remain a supplier
while [keeping it out of]{.underline} the more **[integral parts of its
wireless infrastructure]{.underline}**. President Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline}'s government [has devised rules making it
**riskier** for operators to use **Huawei 5G kit**]{.underline}.

Altice and Bouygues declined to comment. Huawei didn't immediately
return a call for comment.

In July, the head of the country's cybersecurity agency said it will
grant time-limited waivers on 5G for wireless operators that use Huawei
products, a decision that will likely begin a "phasing out" of the
company's products. Macron has broadened those exclusions under pressure
from the U.S., which sees Huawei as beholden to the Chinese Communist
Party and a threat to national security.

To be able to deploy new mobile networks, Altice and Bouygues have now
begun removing Huawei 4G equipment in a number of cities \-- including
Toulouse, Toulon, Rennes and Brest \-- as it's incompatible with the 5G
kit they plan to install from other vendors, said the people, who asked
not to be identified as the specific locations are not public.

three sources close to the matter said.

Like other countries in Europe, [France is **laying the ground** for its
**next-generation 5G** mobile market in the middle of a **growing
geopolitical storm** between two global superpowers.]{.underline}

The United States say the company's equipment could be used by the
Chinese government for espionage - a charge denied by Huawei and
Beijing - and has pressed its allies to ban it.

[France's cybersecurity agency]{.underline} ANSSI [said]{.underline}
this month it would allow operators to use equipment, including
Huawei's, under licences of three to eight years. But it added it [was
urging telcos not currently using the Chinese company's gear to
**avoid** switching to it.]{.underline}

[Several **Sino-Greek**]{.underline} business [deals have]{.underline}
also [been **interrupted**, if not]{.underline} outright
**[canceled]{.underline}**. In 2016, COSCO surprisingly stayed out of
the race to privatize Greece's railway operator TrainOSE, despite
Premier Li Keqiang's earlier interest. In 2018, the National Bank of
Greece severed its negotiations with Gongbao for the sale of Ethniki
Asfalistiki, the country's largest insurance company.42 Five years after
signing a \$200 million investment agreement, real estate and financial
group Fosun International withdrew in 2019 from a massive project to
develop the former Hellenikon airport, apparently due to "years of
delays caused by red tape and the country's economic crisis."43
Tellingly, the Chinese consortium was not entitled to bid for a gambling
license that was eventually awarded to the U.S.-based Mohegan group and
Greek construction company Gek Terna. More recently, in January 2021,
the Greek government did not allow China's State Grid (which already
held a 24 percent stake in Greece's high-voltage Independent Power
Transmission Operator) to bid for a 49 percent stake in the country's
mid/low-voltage distribution network operator. Another Chinese
state-owned enterprise, South Power Grid, was also disqualified. Lastly,

tenders. [Although the Hungarian government has not]{.underline}

[Building on **Ericsson** and **Síminn's** long-term partnership, the
new **5G deal** will]{.underline} help to [enable the next generation of
innovation in **Iceland**]{.underline}. 5G RAN products and solutions
from the Ericsson Radio System portfolio, including Ericsson Spectrum
Sharing will be deployed.

The journey to 5G began when the companies conducted 5G trials as a part
of a network modernization initiative.

Síminn will deploy 5G on 3.5-3.6GHz mid-band spectrum. The mid-band 5G
deployment significantly enhances throughput to unlock the full
potential of 5G. It can also be the key to unlocking a huge range of new
opportunities in areas such as gaming, transport and manufacturing.

[5G]{.underline} technology [is designed to handle anticipated network
capacity in the future]{.underline} - mobile data traffic in Europe
alone is set to grow by more than 30 percent every year until 2025.

According to the latest Ericsson Mobility Report, 5G is expected to be
the fastest deployed mobile communication technology in history and is
forecast to cover about 60 percent of the world's population in 2026.

Síminn aims to reach nationwide coverage by the end of 2022. Síminn
5G\'s deployment will begin by using of one of the legacy bands for
low-band 5G, which enables wider coverage.

Erik Figueras Torras, CTO, Síminn, says: "Building on our good and
long-standing partnership with Ericsson means that we're able to foster
innovation in new and exciting ways. With 5G we will be able to create
new opportunities for Síminn, our customers, and the environment by
adding even more value to our network infrastructure and services."

He adds: "We can start looking even more at a digital future and
capitalize on 5G-driven experiences from industry 4.0 opportunities to
transforming how our customers and travelers to Iceland interact with
Iceland's cultural and natural offering."

Jenny Lindqvist, Head of Ericssom Northern and Central Europe, says:
"[This deal]{.underline} confirms the promising development of 5G in
Iceland. As tourism is the most significant industry in Iceland, 5G
opens up a range of opportunities, particularly in the areas of
audiovisual and augmented reality. We've already seen innovative
benefits with immersive outdoor and digital experiences. It also
[positions Síminn as a **reliable provider of 5G** and gives their
customers the **confidence** that they are getting **best-in-class
technology and service**]{.underline}."

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Italy

#### Recent actions prove.

[Italy has **prevented** telecoms group]{.underline} Fastweb [from
signing a deal for Huawei]{.underline} \[HWT.UL\] [to supply equipment
for its 5G core network,]{.underline} three sources close to the matter
said, the clearest [sign]{.underline} yet [Rome is adopting a **tougher
stance** against the **Chinese group**]{.underline}.

The decision, made at a cabinet meeting late on Thursday, marks the
[first time Italy has **vetoed** a **supply deal** over 5G core networks
with Huawei]{.underline}.

Visiting Italy in September, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
described Chinese mobile telecoms technology as a threat to Italy's
national security.

Huawei strongly rejects the charges, and its Italian unit said it was
ready to undergo any scrutiny to show that its technology was safe.

However at Thursday's meeting, the government used its special vetting
powers to block Fastweb, the Italian unit of Swisscom, from implementing
a supply deal with the firm in the most sensitive part of its fifth
generation mobile network, the sources said.

"The government has vetoed the operation, asking Fastweb to diversify
its suppliers," a senior government source told Reuters.

Fastweb had picked Huawei as the sole supplier for its 5G core network,
sources said. Huawei and Fastweb both declined to comment.

A source from the Prime Minister's office said Rome also wants to
evaluate whether Huawei can play a role in 5G core networks.

While some U.S. allies, such as Britain, have announced bans on Huawei
equipment in future telecoms infrastructure, Italy has so far declined
to do so.

However, government and industry sources say [**Rome** is **de facto
adopting** a **more marked pro-U.S. line on 5G deals**]{.underline}.

Italy raised hackles in Washington last year when it became the first
major Western economy to join China's international infrastructure
project, the Belt and Road Initiative.

The tie-up has so far yielded little economic gain and the government
has recently opted for increasingly stringent prescriptions over Chinese
5G suppliers, which is forcing companies to be more cautious about
dealing with Huawei.

[Measures imposed by the government on firms using Huawei
equipment]{.underline} on their 5G network [include restrictions on
remote interventions to fix technical glitches and an **extremely high
security threshold**]{.underline}, two industry sources have said.

[Italy's **biggest phone group**]{.underline} Telecom Italia (TIM) in
July [left Huawei out of an invitation to tender for a contract to
supply 5G equipment for its core network, where sensitive data are
processed.]{.underline}

[Telecommunications companies operating in **Italy** have introduced
**get-out clauses** in 5G deals with Huawei]{.underline}, allowing them
to withdraw should Rome ask for costly requirements in exchange for its

#### Latvia's [on the fence]{.underline} now BUT US pressure ensures [say yes]{.underline}.

Una Aleksandra **Bērziņa-Čerenkova 21**, the Head of Riga Stradins
University China Studies Center and the Head of the New Silk Road
program at the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, January 2021,
\"Latvia: no place for ambiguity,\" *Huawei in Central and Eastern

[Latvia became]{.underline} the [second]{.underline} among the [Baltic
countries]{.underline}, after Estonia, [to sign]{.underline} the
[**Joint Declaration** on **5G Security** with the US]{.underline}22 on
February 27, 2020, ending a period of political ambiguity on the issue.
The text of the document remains classified. However the Latvian public
broadcaster has reported that according to its sources [the text speaks
of Latvia's commitment to examine "whether a **5G tech**nology supplier
isn't creating **security risks**"]{.underline}.23 The [Minister of
Foreign Affairs]{.underline} implicitly [reaffirmed]{.underline} the
most probable [**exclusion** of **Huawei**]{.underline}: "These
companies have to take into account that there will be certain questions
at the moment when they'll want to cooperate with state structures,
especially with those state structures that deal with security, foreign
policy and issues of such level."24

Although the joint declaration, as in other cases, is a non-binding one,
under the current circumstances, the entry and development of Huawei in
the segment of 5G networks can be characterized as "never say never, but
extremely complicated".25 Interestingly, unlike in North Macedonia or
Cyprus, the signing of the declaration was not followed by a reaction or
statement of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China.

A strong signal that Latvia plans to rely on Northern European 5G
infrastructure providers also came from the Ministry of Defense, as the
"first 5G military test site in Europe"26 was launched at the Ādaži base
by the mobile network operator Latvijas Mobilais Telefons (LMT) on
November 13, 2020. LMT, the majority stake in which is owned by the
state of Latvia, and the minority stake by the Swedish-Finnish
TeliaSonera, is cooperating with Nokia on 5G. The 5G military test site
featured only 5G routers locally produced by the Latvian company
MicroTik.

The remaining two network operators aside from LMT (namely Tele2 and
Bite) followed the ambiguous approach longer, but it is also coming to
an end. Bite Latvija, owned by the US private equity investment fund
Providence Equity Partners LLC27 through Bite Lietuva, had signed an MoU
on cooperation in 5G networks with Huawei in 2018, and had been
consistently voicing a pro-Huawei position: "Latvian mobile phone
operator Bite Latvija will not suspend its partnership with the company
and will go forward with its plans to introduce a 5G network with the
help of Huawei."28 However, upon the signing of the Joint Declaration,
Bite's messaging became less assured, claiming that even though "it's
still unclear which company's technology will be used", Bite is
"developing a 5G network in cooperation with (..) Tele2, (...) Tele2 is
also developing a parallel 5G network using Nokia infrastructure".29

As in similar cases across Europe, [one cannot say with **full
certainty** that Huawei will be **excluded** from]{.underline} the
rollout of [the 5G network in Latvia]{.underline}. Still, the local
mobile network operators (MNOs) are becoming increasingly aware of the
risks the cooperation with Huawei will bring, making Huawei
participation in 5G network installation in Latvia very unlikely.
Certainly, the final decision of Bite Latvia is a to watch aspect, as
currently it is the only mobile network operator that had planned to
cooperate with Huawei. Although the MNOs are generally reluctant to
commit to the exclusion of Huawei, and the issue is mostly promoted by
the defense-oriented government actors, [the **leeway** of mobile
network operators is very limited, because the **push** towards the
**exclusion of Huawei** ultimately comes from Latvia's **primary
security guarantor** -- **the United States**.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Lithuania

#### Lithuania says yes.

Deeba **Ahmed 21**, reporter for Hackread.com, 9/24/2021, \"Lithuania

**[Lithuania's Defense Ministry]{.underline}** has [released a
**warning**, urging consumers to get rid of their Chinese phones and not
to buy new ones]{.underline}.

This [warning comes in response to **Lithuanian cybersecurity
researchers**]{.underline} [identifying several **security flaws** and
censorship-related **loopholes** in certain Chinese-made
smartphones.]{.underline}

Hackread.com has learned that researchers tested 5G mobiles from
different Chinese mobile makers, including Huawei, Xiaomi, and OnePlus
8T.

Four Major Cybersecurity Risks Discovered

[Lithuania's National Cyber Security Center]{.underline} (NCSC)
[revealed]{.underline} that [four **major cybersecurity
flaws**]{.underline} were [identified in smartphones made
by]{.underline} Xiaomi and [Huawei]{.underline}. Two of the flaws were
related to pre-installed applications, and one was involved in private
data leakage.

Huawei P40, according to the report, is responsible for putting users at
risk of cyber-security breaches. The report revealed that the official
Huawei application store called AppGallery is directing users to
third-party stores. Some of the apps uploaded at the store were declared
malicious or infected with viruses after these were scanned through
anti-virus programs.

After the NCSC's report, the [Defense Deputy Minister]{.underline} of
Lithuania, Margiris Abukevicius, [released this]{.underline} statement.

"Our [recommendation is to not buy new Chinese phones, and to get rid of
those already purchased as fast as reasonably possible]{.underline}."

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Luxembourg

#### Luxembourg says yes.

Anne **Morris 20**, contributing editor for Light Reading, 12/15/2020,
\"Proximus dumps Huawei in Luxembourg too,\" Light Reading,
<https://www.lightreading.com/5g/proximus-dumps-huawei-in-luxembourg-too/d/d-id/766126>,
RMax

Yet another European mobile network has decided to drop Huawei in favor
of a less complicated relationship with a more local vendor.

**[Proximus]{.underline}**, [which has already turned to Ericsson and
Nokia](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/belgian-telcos-drop-huawei-for-nokia/d/d-id/764525) in
its primary market of Belgium, [has]{.underline} now also
[picked]{.underline} Finland-based [**Nokia** for its 5G network in
neighboring **Luxembourg**.]{.underline}

[Under a seven-year deal for the Luxembourg network, Nokia said it will
suppl]{.underline}y its AirScale Single RAN (S-RAN) portfolio for both
indoor and outdoor coverage, including [5G RAN]{.underline}, AirScale
basestations and Nokia AirScale radio access products.

According to Strand Consult, [Proximus was previously 100% reliant on
equipment from **Huawei**]{.underline} for its 4G radio access networks
(RAN) [in Belgium and Luxembourg.]{.underline}

In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Nokia indicated that it will \"replace
the incumbent radio vendor in the deal with deployment expected to
commence next year.\"

**[Orange Luxembourg]{.underline}**, also said by Strand Consult to be
fully reliant on Huawei equipment for its 4G RAN, [has]{.underline}
already [chosen Nokia for its 5G network]{.underline}. [Post
Luxembourg]{.underline}, which has not previously used China-based
vendors, [has retained Sweden-based Ericsson for 5G]{.underline}.

Although **[the Luxembourg government]{.underline}** does not appear to
have banned Huawei from 5G networks, it [has clearly been keeping a
close eye on the **geopolitical situation** and the **responses of its
European neighbors**.]{.underline}

According to
a [report](https://today.rtl.lu/news/luxembourg/a/1559647.html) by RTL
Luxembourg from August 2020, [Prime Minister]{.underline} Xavier
[Bettel]{.underline}, also Minister of Communications, [explained that
according to Luxembourg law, operators in the Grand Duchy are
**obliged** to ensure the **security** of their networks]{.underline}.

It would seem that the [local operators are taking \"geostrategic
sensitivity\" into account in]{.underline} their [selection of
vendors]{.underline}, as Bettel suggested they should do.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Montenegro

#### Montenegro says yes.

Vaughan **O\'Grady 22**, reporter for Developing Telecoms, 3/8/2022,
\"Montenegro's Crnogorski Telekom launches 5G using DSS,\"
<https://developingtelecoms.com/telecom-technology/wireless-networks/13082-montenegro-s-crnogorski-telekom-launches-5g-using-dss.html>,
RMax

From the start of this week, [the users of Crnogorski Telekom in the
Montenegrin capital]{.underline} Podgorica [have]{.underline} had
[access to a **5G network**]{.underline} in a number of locations,
making the company the first operator in Montenegro to put a 5G network
into commercial operation.

The operator says that 5G is available to all users, regardless of the
package they subscribe to, as long as they have a suitable device and
are in the area covered by the signal.

It's early days yet of course. The company points out that the gradual
extension of 5G coverage will follow until the first in a series of
goals is achieved: full coverage of the capital with the new generation
network. At the moment, the emphasis is on increasing the capacity of
the network and reducing latency.

The estimate is that by the end of May most important areas in Podgorica
will be covered, and by the beginning of summer important areas on the
coast will have coverage, allowing tourist traffic access to 5G.

[The 5G network]{.underline} in Podgorica [is]{.underline} based on
dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) [implemented by **Telekom** in
**partnership** with **Ericsson** Nikola Tesla]{.underline}. This allows
existing infrastructure and 4G spectrum to be used.

As for future 5G spectrum availability, spectrum auctions took place in
late December. Licences obtained during the auctions are valid between
21 April 2022 and 1 September 2031. 5G mobile networks are expected to
be introduced by the end of 2022. It is not clear when they will cover
the entirety of Montenegro\'s territory of 13,812 square kilometres and
its 620,739 population.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Netherlands

#### The Netherlands dislike Huawei.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - [**KPN** has chosen]{.underline} Sweden's
[**Ericsson** to build core elements of its new 5G mobile network
following a decision last year **not** to select **China's Huawei**, the
**Dutch** telecoms company said]{.underline} on Thursday.

Huawei is effectively banned in the United States and Washington had
expressed fears that if KPN's 5G backbone contained Huawei equipment it
would be vulnerable to spying by the Chinese state.

Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment and smartphone vendor,
has denied U.S. allegations that it is ultimately answerable to the
Chinese government and is therefore a security risk.

[KPN said]{.underline} in April 2019 that [it would select a **Western
supplier** to build its **core 5G mobile network**]{.underline}, making
it one of the first European operators to eliminate Huawei.

In its statement on Thursday, [KPN said it "will collaborate with
Ericsson" for the implementation of its core 5G technology]{.underline}.

No financial details of the deal with Ericsson were disclosed.

OSLO (Reuters) - [Telenor has picked Sweden's **Ericsson** as the **key
technology provider** for]{.underline} its fifth-generation [(5G)
telecoms network in **Norway**]{.underline}, it said on Friday,
**[gradually removing China's Huawei]{.underline}** \[HWT.UL\] after a
decade of collaboration over 4G.

[Fearing **high-tech espionage**]{.underline}, and battling with China
over trade, [the United States has pushed **NATO allies** such as Norway
to **exclude** Huawei from lucrative 5G deals, and Norwegian security
services also warned against the firm]{.underline}.

"The 5G era is here. This will be the one technology that will most
transform our society in the next decade," Telenor Chief Executive Sigve
Brekke tweeted as he announced that Ericsson will build the 5G radio
access network (RAN).

He said [Telenor had carried out an **"extensive" security
evaluation**]{.underline} as well as considering factors such as
technical quality, innovation and modernisation [of the
network.]{.underline}

"Based on the comprehensive and holistic evaluation, [we have decided to
introduce a **new partner** for this **important technology shift in
Norway**," he added]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Poland

#### Poland wants to cooperate with the US.

RMax

These events have accelerated Poland's domestic debate on the role of
Huawei in constructing the country's 5G networks. Simultaneously,
[growing tensions between China and the US have]{.underline} also
[affected Warsaw's perception of threat vis-à-vis Beijing]{.underline}.
As the [**US** remains Poland's **key ally**]{.underline} in the
post-Cold War order, [Sino-American]{.underline} strategic [rivalry has
resulted in Warsaw's **growing skepticism** towards]{.underline}
unconditional **[cooperation with Beijing]{.underline}**.

During the visit of the US vice president Mike Pence to Poland in
September 2019, [the two countries signed the **US-Poland Joint
Declaration on 5G**]{.underline}.17 The [Polish prime
minister]{.underline} Mateusz [Morawiecki]{.underline} has also
[promoted the notion of "**European 5G realism**", which]{.underline} in
practice [means **more awareness** of **risks** stemming from
**technological cooperation** with actors from **non-democratic
states**]{.underline}.18

Currently, the **[most important legal tool]{.underline}** that could
result in Huawei's ban [in Poland is a]{.underline} draft [amendment
to]{.underline} the existing **[cybersecurity law]{.underline}**
published on September 7, 202019. Some of [its provisions
suggest]{.underline} that [vendors categorized as **high-risk** would be
**banned**]{.underline} from the Polish market. ICT providers will
supposedly be assessed based on a number of categories, some of them
indirectly pointing at Huawei. For example, firms from countries outside
of the EU might undergo greater scrutiny for political and security
reasons. The new law is supposed to come into force by December 21,
2020. At the time of writing, however, the ultimate form of the
amendment remains unclear.

In the nearest future, [Poland will **most probably** witness a
**growing trend** towards **diversification** of
telecommunications]{.underline} services providers stemming from both
practical and political considerations.

#### Poland says yes.

[Poland plans to restrict **\"high-risk\" 5G telecom
vendors**]{.underline} in ways that go beyond a series of security
controls proposed by the European Union, [a **minister** told
POLITICO.]{.underline}

The EU last week spelled out a range of options for countries to secure
their future networks amid a transatlantic debate about 5G security and
Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE.

But [Poland, a **close ally of the United States**, will introduce
**tougher controls** that would \"**limit** the use of \[telecom
equipment\] vendors who are **suspicious** or who are **not necessarily
trustworthy**, or who do **not stick to the security standards**,\"
Digital Minister Marek Zagórski said during an interview in
Brussels]{.underline}.

[Poland wants to \"become **independent** from **one vendor**,\" added
the minister]{.underline}, who is a member of the ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) party. Local telecom operators procured Huawei equipment for their
rollout of previous generations of internet networks, but [the
government has]{.underline} since [turned **skeptical** of relying on
Chinese kit]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Say No\-\--Portugal

#### Portugal says yes.

RMax

[**Limits** on the extent to which]{.underline} Chinese
telecommunications giant [**Huawei** will be involved in **Portugal's**
developing **5G network** are expected to be announced
today]{.underline}, writes Expresso.

[The decision]{.underline} will be taken at the weekly 'council of
ministers' and [follows advice from Brussels about reducing exposure to
**"high risk" suppliers**]{.underline}.

Brussels' warning to all member states essentially focused on the
advantages of using "various suppliers" so that no country found itself
"dependent" on one alone.

Explain reports, this would almost certainly affect "the scale and depth
of the use of Huawei technology in the nation's future 5G network" as
the company is one of the technological partners of national operators
Altice and NOS.

Intriguing in this story is the fact that when US secretary of state
Mike Pompeo visited Lisbon in January, news stories claimed Portugal had
rebuffed US concerns over 5G business with Huawei (click here).

Now, reports are referring to comments made by [secretary of state for
communications]{.underline} Alberto Souto Miranda last spring,
[suggesting Portugal was likely to follow Germany's lead]{.underline} in
how to deal with the situation.

Said Mr Miranda, [Germany]{.underline} isn't setting out to 'banish' any
particular suppliers. Instead it [has created a set of **security
measures** through which companies must pass in order for the use of
their equipment to qualify.]{.underline}

Today's developments are expected as the telecoms market awaits
information on the imminent 5G 'auction', to be held sometime in April.

The idea, says Jornal Económico, is for the national 'roll-out' of 5G to
begin in June.

Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to comment on the
Handelsblatt story, telling a government news conference that the same
security standards would apply to all vendors. The interior and economy
ministries, both run by Merkel allies, said discussions on the
legislation were continuing.

[European governments have been **reviewing** market leader **Huawei's
role** in the building of **their networks** following **pressure** from
the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, which says it poses a security
threat because, among other concerns, Chinese companies and citizens

Restricting Huawei is the right approach, a senior U.S. official said,
urging Berlin to support its NATO allies by removing Chinese technology
from its next-generation networks.

"[We are seeing things moving in the **right direction** in

Two of the three major Indian telecom operators, Reliance Jio and Bharti
Airtel, have developed Open RAN network technology, working with U.S.
and Japanese equipment makers and system integrators. In that
underdeveloped market which features over a billion, mostly low-cost,
mobile users, the Open RAN technology will allow faster and much less
expensive deployment of high speed 5G than the traditional hardware
systems offered by Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and even Huawei. U.S. system
integration firm Parallel Wireless estimates that Open RAN solutions,
although needing some technological advances in energy efficiency to
reach their full potential, could result in cutting total operating
costs by 30-50%. [In **Turkey**]{.underline}, [telecom giant Turk
Telecom is working on an **Open RAN system**, and Vodafone Turkey has
already deployed such a network which is backwardly integrated with
legacy 2-3-4G systems]{.underline}.

[In the United States the **three major mobile operating companies** are
**all members** of the **Open RAN Policy Coalition**]{.underline} and
the international O-RAN ALLIANCE. All are developing products utilizing
the new technology. The case study that likely will determine the
economic viability of the new technology in the U.S. market is DISH
network. The new operator is committed (under an [agreement with the
U.S. Department of
Justice](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/doj-tmobile-sprint-merger-dish-sale-1203279763/) to
acquire spectrum and other assets from T-Mobile) to field a nationwide
5G network by 2023. It has chosen Open RAN technology for its system and
is working with major system integrators Altiostar and Mavenir, and
equipment and software makers Red Hat, VMMare, Cisco, and Qualcomm as
well as Ericsson and Nokia. DISH plans to do a limited commercial launch
by the third quarter of 2021.

[**Cooperation** among **allies** to realize the potential of
**alternatives** to **Huawei**]{.underline} also [appears to have
**growing support**]{.underline}. In 2021 the EU has surfaced proposals
to cooperate on joint technology work with the U.S., including in
telecommunications. According to survey data, most nations in Southeast
Asia are looking for alternatives to Chinese equipment suppliers. Japan,
Australia and the United States are calling on their respective
international development agencies to support infrastructure investment
alternatives to Chinese firms. Such support could be of material
political and economic interest since Japanese and U.S. equipment makers
are leaders in this technology.

Although **[Huawei]{.underline}** has a large presence in Romania in the
existing 3G and 4G networks, having close relations with most
telecommunications operators, as well as a regional support center in
Bucharest, its [chances to lead the **Romanian 5G rollout** are
**extremely small**]{.underline}.

Romania has not yet organized the 5G tender, despite it being initially
scheduled to take place last year. The tender was postponed for 2021, as
the legislative framework detailing the obligations of future suppliers
is still pending. The reason for the delay was that the Romanian
government was waiting for the European Commission to enact measures
concerning the security of 5G networks in the EU.

Regarding 5G, [Romania was the first country to sign a]{.underline}
Memorandum of Understanding1 [(**MoU**) with the US]{.underline}, on the
occasion of a presidential visit to Washington by Klaus Iohannis, on
August 20, 2019. [The MoU provided for the]{.underline} rigorous
[**evaluation** of all future **5G vendors**]{.underline} to determine
if they have a transparent ownership structure and ethical corporate
practices, as well as if they are subject to the control of a foreign
government, outside an independent judicial review. Although this
document did not explicitly exclude Huawei from supplying 5G equipment
to Romanian telecommunication operators, the company could hardly meet
the conditions named in the MoU. At the same time, the MoU should be
interpreted in conjunction with the US Federal Register of Entities,2
which lists all entities believed to pose serious national
security/foreign policy threats. Huawei was added to the list on May 15,
2020, together with other 114 of its overseas-related affiliates.3 Since
Romania has pledged to have a close cooperation with the US on 5G
security, the chances that Huawei could win the 5G bid are remote.

After his visit to the White House, the Romanian president Iohannis
discussed the MoU with Romania's National Defense Council (CSAT)
regarding how to transpose it into national law. A year later, on August
4, 2020, a first draft law4 was published on the website of the Ministry
of Transport, Infrastructure and Telecommunications.

The draft law states that all manufacturers of technologies, equipment
and software programs, which are intended for the use in the national 5G
networks (as well as in the information and communication
infrastructures of national interest), should obtain an authorization,
granted by decision of the prime minister. However, the authorization is
conditioned by a favorable opinion from the CSAT, after performing a
thorough assessment of the risks, threats and vulnerabilities to the
national security and/or national defense of the equipment manufacturer.
The authorization may be withdrawn following the same procedure.

The draft law also mandates the National Communications Authority
(ANCOM) to request detailed information about the technologies,
equipment, and software used in 5G networks, as well as their
manufacturer, the degree of outsourcing to third parties of certain
activities related to the management of electronic communications
networks provided. Failure to provide this information can result in
heavy fines. Moreover, the law sets out measures for phasing out the
technologies, equipment and software currently in use from noncompliant
providers.

On September 11, 2020, Huawei contested Romania's new 5G security rules
in a letter to Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive
vice-president responsible for EU digital policies.5 The letter was sent
by Huawei's Belgian subsidiary, which argued that the new rules follow
biased and ambiguous criteria, which are in violation of EU law. The CEO
of Huawei Romania also opined that the law was introduced in public
debate for too short a time, only between August 4 and 17, thus the
telecom industry specialists could not assess its impact.6 The
Commission, however, dismissed these allegations, noting that member
states may adopt national cyber security rules through European telecoms
legislation.

In November 2020, [Romania's prime minister]{.underline} Ludovic
**[Orban]{.underline}**7 explicitly [excluded a partnership with the
company in an interview]{.underline} for Radio Europa Libera8 -- [a
**direct consequence** of Romania's strategic partnership with the US on
security issues. We can, thus, **conclude** that **Huawei's prospects**
for participating in the construction of the 5G infrastructure in
Romania are **slim**.]{.underline}

strategic risks in Huawei and other manufacturers' products differently,
the report says. Briefly, the bill would give the government new powers
to boost the security standards of the U.K.'s telecommunication
networks, including banning risky equipment suppliers and setting
technical standards to be met.

The NCSC anticipates that the new security obligations in the bill will
result in improvements in the security of all vendor equipment, the
report adds.

#### **NATO key---5G poses substantive threats to collective defense and deterrence against China---NATO's adaptive capacity is vital**

<https://www.gmfus.org/news/china-5g-and-nato-security>//ekc

From the major trifecta of summits around President Joe Biden's visit to
Europe during the summer, it has [become clear that China will occupy a
**central role** in the **transatlantic relationship**]{.underline} in
the years ahead.

China now [intersects with NATO's agenda in several ways]{.underline}
and occupies a far more entrenched part of the discussion. [While NATO
is not in a military conflict with China, Beijing remains a **key
geopolitical competitor** to the West]{.underline}. Moreover, the
[United States sees China as a direct national **security
threat,**]{.underline} and several plausible contingencies could [draw
the two sides into military confrontation]{.underline}.

The Right Role for NATO

While there are still debates about how far Europe and the United States
should be aligned on China, [the European **NATO** members have
traditionally assumed part of the U.S. security and defense agenda in
exchange for security guarantees.]{.underline} However, [China also
poses a set of distinctly security risks]{.underline} for Europe,
particularly [relating to resilience and critical
infrastructure]{.underline} and to the [**considerable dependency** of
Europe's digital infrastructure **on Chinese technology**.]{.underline}
The current debate lies in [whether NATO is **the optimal platform** to
address those issues]{.underline}, if the EU should take a more active
role instead, or if there is an appropriate division of responsibilities
between them. For resilience to be the catalyst of closer NATO-EU
cooperation[, **a balance**]{.underline} [**must be found** in which the
roles of both sides are explicitly defined.]{.underline}

While NATO is adopting a more robust framework in the non-military
dimension, it [ultimately remains focused mostly on **political
coordination** and consultation, **crisis management** and collective
defense, and **interoperability.**]{.underline} The EU, on the other
hand, has a range of regulatory instruments at its disposal, including
the 5G Toolbox and the European Democracy Action Plan, to address some
of the wider resilience issues. Future NATO­--EU cooperation should be
established on the basis of closer [linkages between traditional
military-capability planning and resilience requirements, as well as a
clear understanding of common ground and shared
responsibilities.]{.underline}

Defense of Civilian Telecommunications

Strong, modern telecommunications [infrastructure capable of
intercepting and withstanding hybrid interference is **a prerequisite
for NATO to deliver** on its key mission of collective
defense]{.underline}. Yet, this [infrastructure in Europe is largely
privately owned]{.underline}, and as such is left [exposed to the risk
of external interference and susceptible to economic decisions that can
neglect national security aspects]{.underline} if not clearly regulated
by law. [Russia is no longer the only state actor]{.underline} resorting
to various types of hybrid tactics on NATO territory[: China, too, has
been using various sophisticated political and non-military tactics to
**advance** its political and economic **influence**.]{.underline} In
the face of these existing threats, it is imperative for NATO and the EU
to delineate their scope of action, especially in instances---such as
telecommunications---where the line between civil and military
infrastructure is not clearly marked.

[Technological dominance ensures not only battlefield supremacy but also
supremacy beyond it.]{.underline} Such dominance is contingent on a
robust and constantly advancing industrial base that integrates civilian
and military innovation, research, and development.

[Telecommunications play a central role in the functioning of societies
and economies, and provide the basis and **future of
innovation**]{.underline}. These two dimensions are subsequently [linked
in the race for technological supremacy.]{.underline} Technology has
been and will [be the key to deterrence and defense.]{.underline}
Technological dominance ensures not only battlefield supremacy but also
supremacy beyond it. Such dominance [is contingent on a robust and
constantly advancing industrial base that integrates civilian and
military innovation, research, and development.]{.underline} Joint
innovation [**initiatives** across the Atlantic are **essential** to
maintain and heighten critical capabilities on and off the battlefield.
In the interest of maintaining NATO's competitive edge and strengthening
the alliance's resilience, new political channels integrating the
economic dimensions underpinning elements of security policy,
particularly with regards to industrial strategy, need to be
established.]{.underline}

Prioritize 5G

Given that cyber threats have long been an area of concern for NATO, [5G
networks have naturally become a focus for NATO
discussions]{.underline}, even if its defense dimensions have only been
slowly put on the agenda. In addition[, how data is processed and stored
is a key security area that must not become a blind spot]{.underline}.
[Protecting the public sector and industries]{.underline}, along with
ensuring that companies, citizens, and government institutions have the
possibility of sending their traffic end-to-end to a non-Chinese
network, [is at the heart of the matter.]{.underline}

In 5G, for instance, [cloud infrastructure will play a significant
role.]{.underline} Under Chinese law, the government can request and be
granted access to the data of any private company in China[, putting at
risk all data on a Chinese 5G cloud.]{.underline} To take the example of
[Belgium, all of its telecommunications infrastructure was previously
reliant on Chinese equipment, including mobile communications used by
the EU and NATO administrations]{.underline}. Similarly, Chinese
equipment today permeates Germany's networks, meaning that the mobile
traffic of all NATO troops based in Germany goes, at some point, through
networks reliant on Chinese technology. Deutsche Telekom's cloud, built
and run by Huawei, had the Nuclear Research Center (CERN) in Switzerland
as a key reference customer upon its launch. While it is clearly a
minimum requirement to have scrutiny in place for networks that fulfill
functions for government networks, defense industry, and internal
security, [networks that fulfill critical functions for
society]{.underline}, such as in utilities and pharmaceutical
industries, healthcare, banking, or transportation and communication,
[must likewise not rely on Chinese equipment.]{.underline}

The cost of replacing Chinese telecommunications infrastructure in
Europe will not be prohibitive: as operators upgrade from 4G to 5G, [all
aging equipment will be replaced regardless.]{.underline}

As such, a total ban on new Huawei equipment in Europe could
["naturally" take about six years before the installed untrusted base is
simply phased out.]{.underline} [The question then, is rather one of
ensuring a faster transition towards trusted technology on national
security grounds]{.underline}, where short-term commercial
considerations regarding phaseout times do not determine the pace.
[Chinese vendors are neither more technologically advanced,]{.underline}
nor more competitive than their European counterparts: [they simply rely
on a system in which the combination of subsidies for homegrown
companies operating on global markets]{.underline} and a heavily
protected domestic market continue to distort the playing field. The
issue is most acute for the smaller operators across Europe, Latin
America, and Asia, which have weaker credit scores and thus must resort
to Chinese loans unless alternative financing mechanisms are offered.
[The United States and South Korea are considered leaders in 5G network
rollout, yet their infrastructure has been deployed without using any
Chinese equipment, instead relying mostly on European
technology]{.underline}. One commonly suggested long-term alternative is
Open RAN, but, in practice, [Chinese presence and influence in its
development structures requires a comprehensive risk
assessment.]{.underline}

[The EU Toolbox for 5G security offers a good framework for initial
action, but its non-compulsory nature allows for different
interpretation and implementation across EU members, leaving
vulnerabiliti]{.underline}es. One step in the right direction would see
the stricter implementation of the toolbox across the EU, but this is
only a starting point. Networks connecting critical assets via fiber
optics, transport, and undersea cables require the same scrutiny and
strict implementation of safeguards. The joint development of toolboxes
for these network perimeters could then be envisioned too.

China and NATO

Despite the nuanced language adopted at the NATO summit, [the perceived
threat to the security interests and democratic principles of the
alliance have raised the China issue to the status of a major NATO
agenda item]{.underline}. The alliance's policy towards China will be
solidified in the upcoming Strategic Concept, which is expected to be
adopted at the next summit. [The difficulty then will be for NATO to
address the various and diverse security threats at once: hybrid
deterrence, disruptive and emerging technologies, and **vulnerable
critical infrastructure**.]{.underline} Given the fast-changing security
landscape and the rapid development of technology, [its ability to adapt
to this new scenario and act effectively on all these fronts will **be
crucial to NATO's future.**]{.underline}

#### Correcting the lack of a uniform directive in NATO for the 5G race is key to prevent Chinese exploitation of 5G equipment

David A. **Andelman, 19;** exec. Director of The RedLines Project, BA of
Diplomatic History from Harvard, Masters in journalism at Columbia,

correspondent at CBS news, executive editor at Forbes, editor in chief

TODAY, editor emeritus at the World Policy Journal, and current global
affairs columnist at CNN; "NATO countries need to stop China from
winning the 5G race" April 15^th^, 2019
https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/perspectives/huawei-5g-nato/index.html//ekc

Fears that Huawei and its [5G wireless equipment could be **exploited**
by the Chinese government]{.underline} [to spy on other
countries]{.underline} have been growing, spurring some countries ---
[like the United States]{.underline} --- to ban the company's products
altogether. Huawei denies that any of its products pose a national
security risk.

But a recent report from NATO suggests that banning the company's
products would be shortsighted from a strategic standpoint. While
measures need to be put in place to ensure Chinese officials aren't
exploiting Huawei's equipment, rejecting Huawei and its products could
prevent many prospective customers in the West from using the company's
state-of-the-art technology to develop their own advanced 5G downstream
services.

Indeed, [Huawei has managed to position itself on the cutting edge of a
number of innovations in recent years --- integrating western technology
with its own **secret sauce**]{.underline}. These efforts are only
likely to intensify. What's essential for users in the United States and
other countries is that they carefully monitor how every product is
operating and how it is being integrated into their systems.

At the same time, NATO's researchers advise that telecommunications
companies in western countries establish viable alternatives to Huawei's
5G technology. Indeed, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson are
Huawei's biggest competitors, but they've still lagged behind.

[There would be severe consequences should the world depend on a single
supplier, **especially** from a nation like **China**]{.underline}.
[Allowing Huawei to develop a **global supplier monopoly** with **5G**
technology could enable China to quickly leapfrog the West]{.underline}
in developing the next generation space-based 6G networks that are
already beginning to appear on some drawing boards, at least in
academia. Researchers in Finland, for example, are suggesting 6G will
make possible such innovations as clothes that can monitor your health
in real-time as part of a fully AI-enabled world. And [one can only
imagine the military capabilities that 6G would provide. It's clear the
**competition** between China and the United States is only just
**beginning**.]{.underline}

**[NATO]{.underline}** --- a collection of 29 distinct nations, each
with its own approach to technological development and open vs. closed
markets --- [has not adopted, and seems unlikely to adopt, any uniform
approach to Huawei]{.underline} and whatever challenges it might pose.
So in addition to encouraging other nations to develop their own 5G
technology to compete with Huawei[, NATO should adopt a uniform series
of responses to threats from external **military** or **strategic**
challenges.]{.underline} And if Huawei is found to be facilitating
Chinese cyber espionage or military operations, [these countries should
replace Huawei technology with a host of other alternatives]{.underline}
--- from providers like Nokia, Samsung, Qualcomm and Intel.

Indeed, [governments in western nations should provide subsidies for
advanced 5G and 6G research to prevent any one player from achieving
utter dominance]{.underline}. In January 2018, Canada provided some \$40
million to Nokia for research and development of 5G equipment. [The NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCE), author of this
report, should use Canada as a model and coordinate NATO-wide
public-private partnerships of this sort]{.underline}. Raising its
funding to a level that [would allow such **joint NATO-wide operations**
would be an important first step.]{.underline}

The arrival of 5G and the anticipation of 6G, [with all the
extraordinary global advances they hold, will quickly overshadow any
latent fears over the misuse or abuse of these new
technologies]{.underline}. Nor should any such concerns restrain
innovations that are inevitable at every stage in their development. But
vigilance is equally appropriate and [NATO is itself **uniquely
positioned** to take the leading role here]{.underline}.

5.1. Supply Chain Security and Risk Management

As discussed in the introduction, [the **supply chain** has become a
common **attack vector** for nation states' **cyber espionage** and the
**theft** of government and defence sector data]{.underline}.107 [Recent
large-scale, high-impact supply chain cyberattacks]{.underline}, for
example, **[NotPetya]{.underline}** in 2017 [and
**SolarWinds**]{.underline} (also known as Solarigate/Sunburst backdoor
malware attacks) in 2020, [have disrupted **public services** in many
countries, causing huge **economic losses**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[cyberattacks have damaged]{.underline} and disabled [**critical
infrastructure** and **ICT**]{.underline} [systems. Supply chain attacks
can be **difficult to trace** and **manage**. Yet they can cause
**serious second-order effects** such as the **sabotage** or **physical
destruction**]{.underline} of critical infrastructure, [or the theft or
manipulation of sensitive or classified information]{.underline}.108
[This trend will continue]{.underline} in the current decade,
[and]{.underline} the [repercussions for NATO]{.underline} nations'
economic and national security [are]{.underline} likely to be
[severe]{.underline}.

The use of [open source software, poor coding]{.underline} practices,
[insufficient patching, and cyber hygiene]{.underline}; the reliance on
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, systems, and services; [and
the complexity of global supply chain bring **new threats** to the
**military use** of 5G technology. The **global** and **distributed**
nature]{.underline} of product and service supply chains make it
difficult to determine how the acquired technology has been developed
and deployed. In addition, [supply chain risks can also include
so-called **insider threats**]{.underline}.109

Broadly speaking, [supply chain security risks concern the reliability,
availability, safety, and redundancy of networks]{.underline}, as well
as the market diversity of 5G equipment and associated services. [Supply
chain risks to market diversity constitute a situation where MNOs have
**limited choice** of equipment **vendors**]{.underline}. This can
happen when a single vendor, whose proprietary hardware and software is
not interoperable with other vendors' products, dominates a global
market. In this example, a lack of vendor choice can lock a MNO into
using equipment from an untrusted vendor, which creates new security
risks related to the supply chain. [Further examples]{.underline} of
cyber supply chain risks [include: insertion of counterfeits;
unauthorised production; malicious insiders; tampering; theft; insertion
of malicious software and hardware]{.underline} (GPS tracking devices,
computer chips, etc.); [and poor manufacturing and development practices
in the cyber supply chain]{.underline}. These risks are realised when
threats in the cyber supply chain exploit existing vulnerabilities.110

[Supply chain attack vectors can be utilised at any point during the ICT
life cycle, from **design** to **maintenance** and
**retirement**]{.underline}. [Implants]{.underline} (or other
vulnerabilities inserted prior to the installation of equipment) [can be
used to **infiltrate** government and defence sector data]{.underline}
or manipulate hardware and software, computer operating systems, or end
user devices and associated services for economic, political, and
military purposes.111 For example, [the Solarigate/Sunburst supply chain
attack]{.underline}, which [has been attributed to the Russian
government]{.underline}, targeted the software development process;
[this popular attack vector has frequently been used by **Russia**,
**China** and other **authoritarian** countries.]{.underline}112
[Software supply chain attacks can also target telecommunications
technology, including 5G networks]{.underline} -- for example, VNF and
software defined networking (SDN) introduce vulnerabilities to the core
network, [which may be **exploited** by **malicious
actors**]{.underline}.

[The US **DoD** 5G Strategy prescribes addressing **strategic risks**
and adopting **mitigation measures** to minimise risks]{.underline} to
the supply chain. [The strategy prescribes **avoidance** of the use of
5G **technology vendors** who are considered untrusted]{.underline} or
who have unreliable products.113 [Likewise, the Prague Proposals on 5G
security]{.underline} (2019) [and]{.underline} the Centre for Strategic
and International Studies (**[CSIS]{.underline}**) 'Criteria for
Security and Trust in Telecommunications Networks and Services' (2020)
[provide further non-technical criteria]{.underline} for national
decision-makers to assess risks to determine the trustworthiness of a
potential supplier and manufacturers.114 For example, the CSIS criteria
include the following aspects: political and governance, business
practice assessment, and cybersecurity risk mitigation criteria, and
government actions to increase confidence in choosing a supplier.115 The
EU assessment and Prague Proposals address many of the same concerns.

In regard to the supply chain risk, the main concerns of the US
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are counterfeit
components (which are more susceptible to cyber-attacks and more likely
to fail because of their poor quality) and compromised components. A
component may be compromised through interference with the source code
repository, the theft of signing keys, or the penetration of
distribution sites and channels. The CISA notes that thirdparty
suppliers, vendors, and service providers may have weaker security
controls and audits than MNOs, which makes compromised components in
their supply chain more likely. For example, a MNO may buy the core
network system's management software from a trusted provider; however,
it may happen that, unbeknownst to this trusted provider, one of the
components it uses in the product is compromised and contains malicious
code.116 In an earlier advisory from 2019, the CISA divides 5G security
risks into four categories: supply chain, competition and choice,
network security, and deployment. According to this simplified approach,
supply chain risks include malicious hardware and software and
vulnerabilities in the manufacturing of products and their maintenance.
The advisory proposes mitigation measures such as adequate
standardisation and certification schemes, auditing, and vetting and
procurement policies.117

According to a recent survey, large MNOs in the European Union have
moved parts of their operations outside the EU countries because of more
favourable legislative or business environments. This exacerbates the
difficulty of ensuring the reliability, integrity, safety, and security
of the supply chain and introduces new vulnerabilities on the top of the
existing ones mentioned in this sub-chapter, which can be leveraged by
non-EU and non-NATO countries for malicious use.118 In sum, supply chain
risk management is a very complex and multifaceted undertaking,
requiring building trust relationships and communicating with both
internal and external stakeholders.119

[It is **essential** that **NATO** nations' **governments** and
**militaries** have sufficient **transparency** into the processes,
procedures, and practices used by manufacturers of 5G
technology]{.underline} and providers of associated services in order
[to assure the integrity, security, resilience, and
privacy]{.underline}, as well as quality, [of]{.underline} the acquired
[products, systems, and services]{.underline} throughout their whole
life cycle.120 Hence, [militaries must work closely with commercial 5G
network providers to **jointly assess** supply chain and network
**security risks** and add suitable **security assurances** for
military-grade 5G networks]{.underline}. At the time of publication of
this Research Report, [the Alliance has **not begun broad discussions**
with **vendors**, **MNOs**, or other **stakeholders** on how to achieve
**comprehensive visibility** into the supply chain of 5G
networks]{.underline}.

[As a **security partnership**, NATO could]{.underline} potentially
[serve as a forum for **further collaboration** on **security
standards** between the EU and]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. For instance, [the Alliance could refine its
role in **cybersecurity** protection, defence, and resilience. The EU
is]{.underline} still [searching for a common **certification strategy**
to prevent **backdoors**---hidden entry points for **attacking** or
**spying**---which may affect **5G** hardware. This strategy might
help]{.underline} the [EU to surpass current **national-based**
approaches, as well as to **reshore** its **internal production
capabilities** and critical infrastructures' **resilience** and could
strengthen **standards-setting** collaboration within **NATO** regarding
the impacts of **cybersecurity** on 5G networks]{.underline}.

The EU, the United States, and like-minded partners (such as Japan)
should renew their dialogue on the implications of state behaviour norms
in cyberspace for the protection and resilience of 5G networks. [China
has become highly active in the **multilateral arena** by proposing
principles regarding the respect for **cyber sovereignty** and the
shaping]{.underline} of [new **AI-related** uses in line with its
**B**elt and **R**oad **I**nitiative and its **Digital Silk Road**. This
may have **significant implications** on the 5G-driven connectivity of
AI applications. A common **transatlantic position** is therefore sorely
**needed** to tip the balance towards an **open**, **fair**, **secure**,
and **stable** data governance system. Such a "common"
position]{.underline} does not refer to similar policies and regulations
but [would be one through which all partners can **cooperate** on
critical infrastructure connectivity while respecting **common values**
and **fundamental rights**]{.underline}.

[With regards to]{.underline} the [digital economy]{.underline}, both
[allies can **mutually reinforce** each other's assets]{.underline}. The
EU should work on joint technology initiatives with the US and other
partners, as well as pool resources in the many areas that are mutually
beneficial. In turn, the EU could use this collaboration as a two-way
street, to boost its digital credentials in areas where it has incumbent
strengths. [The US, which has no major 5G wireless equipment provider,
will continue to largely rely on the European companies]{.underline}
Ericsson and Nokia but is aiming to accelerate alternatives for the
future. These two European firms, which remain the second and third
largest suppliers in the race for 5G, are also entering deals with
Canada's largest telecoms companies in order to build their 5G networks.

[The importance of **5G systems** has taken on a **geopolitical**
dimension. Given its importance as a **national security** asset and an
**economic driver**, current strategies and principles **cannot be
limited** to national agendas. International stability---security,
peace, economy, and respect for human rights---relies on]{.underline}
both the [**effectiveness** and long-term **readiness** of multilateral
negotiations. Opening up a deep **transatlantic discussion** on the role
of 5G will be **essential** to ensure mutually **beneficial
cooperation**. In turn, this will contribute to]{.underline} subsequent
[ways of dealing with **models** that might leave Western **regulatory
standards** out of the shaping of a **fair** and **safe** technological
near-future]{.underline}.

SECTION 4.

Recommendations

As described in Section 2, 5G gives rise to new technical attack
vectors, as well as old ones. However, this fact is true for most new
technologies, and it is not the reason for this article. The [urgency
arises due to the **processes** involved and the **effects** that the
**gap** between technological **implementation** and **strategic
decision** may have on the **political level**. It is important for
**decision-makers** to **realize** that a basic **understanding** of the
underlying technology is **essential**]{.underline} and cannot be
delegated.

A. Coping with Novel Threats

The technologies used to build our future networks will not only allow
us to move forward in application scenario terms but also force us to do
so technically and strategically. As an example, ENISA reports that,
while it was previously impossible to migrate the workload of a
technical component from one service provider outside of the defined
legal and policy boundaries of that provider without notice, this threat
is now technically feasible. In fact, as georestrictions cannot be
enforced on NFVs in 5G, it is possible to move VNF from one location to
another undetected.27

[Consideration of some of the **possible goals** of **adversary
activities**]{.underline} and the possible motivation [for **attacking
5G networks** highlights that the **threat** should not be assessed only
in terms of **espionage** and **destruction**. **Infiltration**,
**control**, and strategic and **political tactics** should also be
taken as serious concerns. 5G]{.underline} not only
[provides]{.underline} us with the capability to accelerate
technologically but also provides our [adversaries with a **new
dimension** of operational domain. While **cyberspace** has always been
the domain considered most **easily attacked**]{.underline} remotely and
[without attribution, 5G takes this statement to a **new level**.
Through the **softwarization** of our **networks**, we remove a large
portion of the last barrier of]{.underline} what has often been
considered [the 'physical security' of]{.underline} our [network
backbones. This is a **development** that **cannot be stopped** -- in
fact, reliance on this technology is **firmly built** into **future
development** plans]{.underline}. But [the nature of the
threat]{.underline}, especially on the strategic and operational layer,
[dictates taking **precautions** now]{.underline}.

B. Exchange Among Professions

[As the relevant **European** institution, ENISA does an excellent
job]{.underline} of [keeping experts updated]{.underline} and delivering
reports on recent developments. [However, these reports have a
**technical depth** that will most probably make them **incomprehensible
to nonspecialists**. We]{.underline} strongly [encourage lively exchange
between **technical** and **strategic** personnel]{.underline}. An
example of how this can be achieved is to bring together national and
international decision-makers and developers in a similar manner as done
in agile software development.28 The objective of doing so would be
bi-directional: [to foster a **deeper understanding** of the underlying
**technology**]{.underline} at the strategic level and, at the same
time, to accelerate the understanding of strategic and political
considerations and implications among technical personnel. This requires
both groups to have the opportunity to easily and directly exchange
their thoughts.

C. Consensus Strategy and Implementation

Furthermore, [Western allies must **ensure** that they not only enforce
**strategic decisions** nationally but also achieve **common consensus
policies**. This will allow **limitation** in the **variation** of the
technical implementations]{.underline} (which is already considerable)
[and may **reduce incompatibilities**. It also provides the chance to
better **control the gap** between **policy** and
**implementation**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [strategies on
**adequate** and **secure** CI/CD from a strategic view]{.underline},
especially on propagating software updates, [must be **developed** and
**enforced**. Measures must be installed to **identify** and **remove**
malicious software instances among allies]{.underline}. Ways of ensuring
this must be discussed in the context of allied and multinational
operations and meeting different nations' demands collaboratively.
Further research and discussion in this field is needed.

D. 'On-Boarding'

As technical implementation is the practical enforcement of whatever
strategic decision is made, awareness among technical personnel of the
strategic and political implications of technical decisions must be
raised. Additionally, it is reasonable to demand that national
institutions place decision-makers in the developer teams of software
components that have such a wide impact on national cyber sovereignty.

An example of how this could be done is in the context of agile
development by creating a dedicated role within the team. Due to the
novelty of the technology and the beginning of an era where cyber
sovereignty and the security of states are being placed in the hands of
software developers, this role must urgently be defined for exactly this
purpose -- since it has not been previously required, it does not
currently exist. While the exact outline of such a role and the
professional skills required still need to be defined, we stress that
current practice is inadequate for the described purposes, as it
broadens the gap between policy-level stakeholders and the
implementation team while not truly ensuring that someone on the team
fully understands all technical, political, and strategic decisions.

This approach is feasible if the stakeholder is only interested in the
final product outcome but does not need to understand how this product
is achieved and if the developers do not care about the political or
strategic implications of their development decisions (outside their
technical scope). However, when it comes to the development of the
backbone of our future networks, the strategic and political knowledge
of decision-makers must be integrated into the development process, and
strategic and political decision-makers must be aware of how their
decisions are being implemented and the implications of the technical
decisions being made. If it turns out to be impossible to empower
decision-makers to this extent in terms of technical expertise, then
consideration should be given to how dedicated professionals with
expertise regarding the intersection of technical and political
decisions can be educated. How this can be achieved or if there are
other ways to solve these difficulties may be a subject for further
research.

SECTION 5.

Conclusion

[Future **network technologies** will be **critical
enablers**]{.underline} for economic development and prosperity in
**[NATO]{.underline}** member states [and among Western allies. But the
steady **deterioration of relations** with key
**adversaries**]{.underline} -- and the emergence of new ones -- [means
that any **new capability** must be **carefully assessed** to ensure
that]{.underline}, along with prosperity, [it does not bring a means to
**severely harm** the **interests** of the state
introducing]{.underline} it.

[Compared with previous means]{.underline} by [which adversaries could
attack]{.underline} one or more [NATO member states]{.underline} or
Western allies, [5G network technology combines a]{.underline} unique,
and potentially [**uniquely damaging**, set of attributes. It will be
**ubiquitous**; other **key technologies**, including **critical
national infrastructure**, will be **highly dependent** on it; the
**attack surface** is **accelerated**; and most importantly of all, it
will be **easily accessible to hostile actors** once they establish
themselves as **contributors** to the **software backbone**. The result
is that as well as a **radical step forward** in telecommunications
capability, 5G also risks offering an **open door** to those who
would]{.underline} wish to [cause **harm**]{.underline}.

[It is therefore **vitally important** that **planning** for further
rollout of 5G takes **full account** of the fact that it is being
**deployed** in a **hostile world**. An essential element of this is a
**security mindset** that combines **geopolitical** and **technical
awareness**. This]{.underline} awareness [must, in turn, inform a
**critical assessment** of who should and should not be **trusted** to
contribute to the **construction** of the **networks** --
and]{.underline}, just as vitally, [whom they, in turn, enlist as
**subcontractors**]{.underline}. Given the complexity of the software
backbone under construction today, it is unlikely that software from
contributors found to be questionable can be fully removed at a later
date. [It is even unlikely that covert operations to compromise network
components could be discovered at all. The implication is that **NATO**
states may find themselves **operating networks** that are partly
**controlled by foreign nations** without them even **noticing**, until
it is too late -- for instance, if a **hostile power** makes **political
demands** while **threatening to shut down** public communications or
network components]{.underline} serving critical infrastructure.

[The]{.underline} other [vital element of ensuring a **secure
architecture** for 5G is ensuring]{.underline} that [**technical
experts** and government-level strategic planners are **communicating
clearly**, **effectively**, and **fully**]{.underline}. The challenge of
the language gap between technical and policy personnel is hardly a new
one -- but it becomes vastly more important as network architectures
become increasingly incomprehensible to non-experts. Ensuring that both
groups are talking to each other in a way that ensures that what is
being discussed is implemented, and what is implemented is actually
understood with all its strategic and political implications, is another
essential safeguard against this vital new technology being used as a
weapon against the states adopting it.

RMax

A [coronavirus]{.underline}-induced economic crisis could [send Europe
**bargain-shopping** for **critical infrastructure**]{.underline}---in
ways [that might be **dangerous**. Europe']{.underline}s argument on
[moving forward with]{.underline} the implementation of [Huawei
5G]{.underline} technology [against U.S. objections]{.underline} has
long centered on cutting costs. The [U.S. calls for a ban]{.underline}
of the Chinese telecommunications firm's 5G equipment in European
networks [have failed]{.underline} to gain traction in most European
capitals. Just a handful of countries have echoed U.S. demands for
tougher restrictions to supplement the recently released EU toolbox for
5G security, and even fewer have called for an outright ban.

The United States has highlighted the [risks]{.underline} that [Huawei
poses to national security, including]{.underline} the threat of
**[espionage]{.underline}**. Given the Chinese Community Party's
effective control of Huawei, [there is concern over **data
integrity**]{.underline}. More serious is the [potential to
debilitate]{.underline} [**critical infrastructure**. 5G]{.underline}
will be the backbone of communications and controls [needed for power
grids, water supplies, and transportation infrastructure]{.underline}.
In January, the [United Kingdom]{.underline} announced it would [allow
Huawei equipment on 35 percent of its 5G networks]{.underline}---a
decision that could provide top cover for Germany, France, and others to
do the same.

Even so, [there are **bright spots**. Estonia and Poland]{.underline}
announced stronger restrictions to ensure 5G network security, and some
[lawmakers, such as]{.underline} Iain Duncan [Smith in the United
Kingdom and]{.underline} Norbert [Röttgen in German]{.underline}y,
remain [opposed to Huawei's inclusion]{.underline} in their networks,
leaving hope that a clear-eyed risk assessment will prevail. Recently,
[technology industry leaders]{.underline} for open radio access networks
[sent]{.underline} a [letter to the]{.underline} U.K. [House of
Commons]{.underline} Defense Committee [urging it to
abandon]{.underline} implementation of [Huawei]{.underline} technology.
Given the uneven response across Europe, where should the United States
go from here? It can still sway countries that remain on the fence, but
it will need to change tack.

For one, [the **United States should create** a **multilateral
coalition** with]{.underline} like-minded **[European
allies]{.underline}**, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Estonia,
[to reboot conversations about Huawei's role in Europe]{.underline}. A
number of European [countries perceive Washington as]{.underline} a
**[self-interested]{.underline}** messenger and see its fight against
Huawei as merely part of a geopolitical game against China.
[That]{.underline}'s a criticism [Washington should answer,
and]{.underline} it can [emphasize]{.underline} a few [key messages to
do so.]{.underline}

[The coalition should emphasize]{.underline} that [the EU toolbox
is]{.underline} designed to be [a **baseline** for a **common
approach**, **not** a **final answer**]{.underline}. Countries should do
their own risk assessments based on their technical capabilities to
mitigate risk and secure their networks. The coalition should also
dispel the oft-cited myth that there are no viable alternatives to
Huawei. [The United States]{.underline}, and European adopters of Nokia
and Ericsson technology, [must tout the value and quality of Nokia and
Ericsson kit]{.underline}. For one, [the United States should point to
the obvious fact that it is building world-class 5G networks
using]{.underline} solely [Nokia and Ericsson radio access network
equipment]{.underline}.

Then there's the pernicious myth, pushed by Huawei's public relations
team and through Huawei-commissioned reports, that the firm is the
undisputed 5G technology leader. While Huawei leads the pack in number
of patents, qualitative assessments show that [the **value** of its
portfolio is **much less** than that of its competitors---a classic case
of **quantity** over **quality**]{.underline}.

Finally, [the **coalition** should also take on the **cost
argument**]{.underline}. While Huawei may provide the cheapest upfront
option on the market, [countries should examine how Huawei could impose
hidden costs on the backend for maintenance and
installation]{.underline}, beyond the considerable expense associated
with risk mitigation efforts.

[The **United States should**]{.underline} also [**lead** to make **new
alternatives** to Huawei available]{.underline}. A [promising approach
is to promote **open architecture**]{.underline} as a way to upend the
5G status quo. Open architecture consists of proprietary software for
functions like switching, routing, and firewalls that run on
vendor-neutral hardware and standardized interfaces. This would offer
Europe a new way to bypass adoption of Huawei in ways that promote
vendor diversity, lower cost, and better interoperability. The United
States should work with Finland and Sweden to help Nokia and Ericsson,
Huawei's key competitors, transition to this new telecommunications
infrastructure model over the next three to five years.

The United States must face the reality of Europe's strong reliance on
China for economic growth. Beijing has been clear that it is willing to
retaliate over any country's decision to ban Huawei from its networks
with economic coercion. In December, China's ambassador to Berlin
threatened to torpedo German car sales in China. Beijing directed
similar warnings at France. In order to remove the teeth from China's
threats, the United States must show Europe that it is a reliable trade
partner, ending its deleterious trade policies toward Europe and threats
to levy tariffs on European goods. Further, the United States should
expedite U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations. A robust agreement would
help stimulate economic growth and assure Europe that the United States
has its back when European countries exclude Huawei from their networks.
The United States remains the largest single export destination for EU
goods, nearly twice as big as China. Washington should use this economic
clout as a bulwark, not a bludgeon.

Finally, the United States should focus more on the norms and values
that it shares with its European partners to dissuade them from
purchasing Chinese telecommunications equipment. A large part of
Huawei's success in Europe stems from its large-scale lobbying campaign
to convince Europe that it is a trustworthy vendor. Huawei launched a
campaign highlighting its so-called shared values with Europe. Huawei
has likened voting for Huawei 5G with voting for European values.
Largely absent from the 5G debate is the fact that China generally, and
Huawei specifically, uses 5G technologies as part of its campaign to
suppress and isolate Uighurs in Xinjiang, counter protesters in Hong
Kong, and exert greater control over the daily lives of all Chinese.
Buying Huawei kit subsidizes these actions---ones that go against the
core values of the EU itself.

[The United States]{.underline}' one-size-fits-all approach on 5G has
not worked in Europe, and it [must **recalibrate** with a **tailored,
affirmative strategy** and abandon the **blunt** approach of the past
two years. This requires Washington to lead in **conjunction**
with]{.underline} key European [partners by offering **new technological
options**, **strong trade relations**, and a **united front** on shared
norms and values]{.underline}. Above all, this means treating Europe as
the friend, partner, and ally that it is.

Introduction

[Societies will soon be]{.underline} highly [**dependent** on
new]{.underline} and highly [complex **communications**
technologies]{.underline} currently being rolled out. But [these
technologies introduce a whole range of **new vulnerabilities** ripe for
**exploitation** by both **state** and **non-state**
actors]{.underline}. This paper considers the [precautions that must be
taken at]{.underline} a state and [**collaborative** level]{.underline},
such as [through **NATO**,]{.underline} in order [to avoid
**worst-case** scenarios where **adversaries** leverage these **new
vulnerabilities** to achieve everything from **low-level damage** to
strategic **geopolitical gains**]{.underline}.

Many of the [application scenarios]{.underline} envisioned in the near
future ([such as **IoT**, **autonomous driving**, and **Industry
4.0**]{.underline}) [will utilize technologies]{.underline} that are
[increasingly dependent on **virtualizations** to provide]{.underline}
adequate and adaptable [network services. These]{.underline} new
technologies [will determine the **digital evolution** of the coming
years]{.underline} and have in common an increasingly complex underlying
technical and strategic configuration. This will make it increasingly
hard for decision-makers to estimate the impact their decisions have on
the underlying technology and whether political decisions made are
technically feasible.

A purely technical approach to the security and protection of critical
network infrastructure will be insufficient to keep moving forward
securely within the upcoming networks, given recent geopolitical
developments. We will discuss how the technology shifts experienced will
also impact strategic and political decision-making and how to cope with
the implications this has.

[**5G networks** are often perceived as a new networking
standard]{.underline} that simply uses a number of new protocols and
frequencies. [But this is]{.underline} an
**[oversimplified]{.underline}** picture of the nature of 5G networks.
[The underlying structure consists of a mixture of soft- and hardware
**components** whose **complexity** and **orchestration** may be
**difficult** even for dedicated experts to grasp fully]{.underline}.
This becomes even more evident when security predictions are to be made
or when policy regulations are to be implemented technically. Given this
level of complexity, it is difficult to lead an adequate, appropriate,
and reality-based discussion between technical and non-technical
stakeholders. Attempting to do so typically leads to a high level of
abstraction and a meta-language that hides any underlying technology.
This abstract and veiled discussion does not provide decisionmakers with
enough knowledge about the underlying properties to make well-based
decisions and -- conversely -- makes it harder for IT professionals to
translate regulatory language into technical implementations, as the
demands are technically too unspecific and abstract and sometimes even
incompatible with the underlying architecture. This communicative
difficulty is already a security threat in its own right and
significantly exacerbates already complex technical security concerns.

[In]{.underline} October [2019, the EU Commission identified
**state-sponsored** attackers as the **main threat** to]{.underline} the
[**security** of **5G**]{.underline}.1 The EU's risk assessment
identified core security requirements that are different for 5G
networks. Due to the reliance on software, the types of devices and
services connected, and the heavily interconnected nature of 5G
networks, there are more entry points for attackers. Nokia's head of
product management security stated that 5G networks have 200 times more
attack vectors than their 4G predecessors.2 Network services such as
VIMs (virtualized infrastructure managers) have already been identified
as crucial assets3 that are expected to be attacked heavily.

[The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity]{.underline}
(**[ENISA]{.underline}**) report 'Threat Landscape for 5G Networks'4
[describes a list of **evolving threats**]{.underline}, and multiple
experts have published their findings and concerns regarding the
security of the underlying technology. [While one may assume that the
**technical community** is **aware** of these threats]{.underline}
(although the same assumption may not apply to anyone outside this
largely self-contained bubble), [what is truly lacking is a
**discussion** on how these **threats** may impact **political
decisions** and how adversary strategies]{.underline} may [utilize this
evolving threat landscape to their benefit. The]{.underline} prominent
[discussion that immediately comes to mind is]{.underline} the exclusion
of **[Huawei]{.underline}** from contributing to the development of 5G
[networks in]{.underline} a range of [Western nations. Although this
might **suggest** that there is already **adequate discussion** on 5G
security concerns]{.underline} and their policy implications, [closer
**investigation** proves the **contrary**]{.underline}.

The concerns addressed in the Huawei exclusion were mainly regarding the
development of hardware components. [From the view of an IT **security
professional**]{.underline}, hardware security flaws are, of course, not
to be neglected, but [the more **serious concern** in 5G networks ought
to be around the **software attack surface**. This was **not a prominent
topic** within the public discussion, nor did]{.underline} the
[discussion lead to **clear guidance** for how Western nations ought to
proceed with]{.underline} Huawei or other [software
contributors]{.underline} that are considered to be [controlled by
**adversarial state** interests]{.underline}.

[As 5G, and]{.underline} the already planned [6G, is]{.underline}
currently [forming the backbone of]{.underline} the
**[networks]{.underline}** we use for a multitude of applications, [we
need to **ensure** that **security aspects** are considered adequately
and jointly on both the **strategic** and **technical** level. Technical
**flaws** in future network backbones]{.underline} resulting from
inadequate translation or communication between strategic
decision-makers and technical practitioners [may render Western nations
susceptible to **politico-technical blackmail** by adversary
actors]{.underline}. This is [especially]{.underline} the case [if the
adversary has]{.underline} the [**technical knowledge** and **power** to
abuse]{.underline} these [weaknesses and]{.underline} if the adversary
[is aware of these weaknesses]{.underline} before Western nations are.
[This is a **one-way street** -- this weakness cannot be used by Western
nations for retaliatory offensive measures]{.underline} against such
adversaries.

Some of the [crucial questions]{.underline} that [must be
asked]{.underline} among allies are: [do we consider security in 5G
networks equally]{.underline}, and do we take appropriate actions?
[Are]{.underline} these [actions technically feasible, and
do]{.underline} the technical [implementations correspond
to]{.underline} our [strategic plans? Can we **agree** on **equivalent
levels** of security to be met]{.underline}, and what are our measures
to uphold this level of security? Are these measures compatible with
each other, especially on the technical level? Or do they induce further
security threats? And [most fundamentally]{.underline} of all, [have
**plans** for networks provided for their **protection** and
**resilience** against attacks]{.underline} using state-level
capabilities and resources?

Bruce **Schneier 20**, fellow and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University, 1/20/2020, \"China Isn't the Only
Problem With 5G,\" Foreign Policy,

RMax

The [security risks **inherent** in Chinese]{.underline}-made
[5G]{.underline} networking equipment [are easy to
understand]{.underline}. Because [the companies that make the equipment
are **subservient** to the Chinese government, they could be forced to
include **backdoors** in the **hardware** or **software** to give
Beijing **remote access**]{.underline}. Eavesdropping is also a risk,
although efforts to listen in would almost certainly be detectable. More
insidious is the possibility that [Beijing could use its access to
degrade or disrupt **communications services** in]{.underline} the event
of [a **larger geopolitical conflict**]{.underline}. Since the internet,
especially the "internet of things," is expected to rely heavily on 5G
infrastructure, potential [Chinese infiltration is a **serious national
security threat**]{.underline}.

But [keeping [**untrusted
companies**](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/08/08/huawei-is-trying-to-solve-a-hard-problem) like
**Huawei** out of Western infrastructure [**isn't
enough**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/huawei-internet-security.html) to
secure 5G]{.underline}. Neither is banning Chinese microchips, software,
or programmers. [**Security vulnerabilities** in the
**standards**]{.underline}---the [protocols and software for
5G]{.underline}---[ensure that vulnerabilities will **remain**,
regardless of **who provides** the hardware and software]{.underline}.
These insecurities are a result of market forces that prioritize costs
over security and of governments, including the United States, that want
to preserve the option of surveillance in 5G networks. If the United
States is serious about tackling the national security threats related
to an insecure 5G network, it needs to rethink the extent to which it
values corporate profits and government espionage over security.

To be sure, there are significant [security
improvements](https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5G-Security-White-Paper-07-26-19-FINAL.pdf) in
5G over 4G---in encryption, authentication, integrity protection,
privacy, and network availability. But the enhancements aren't enough.

This design dramatically increases the points vulnerable to attack.

The [5G security problems are **threefold**. **First**]{.underline}, the
standards are simply too complex to implement securely. This is true
for [all
software](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html),
but the [5G protocols offer]{.underline} particular
**[difficulties]{.underline}**. Because of how it is designed, the
system blurs the wireless portion of the network connecting phones with
base stations and the core portion that routes data around the world.
Additionally, [much of the network is **virtualized**]{.underline},
meaning that [it will rely on software running on dynamically
configurable hardware. This design]{.underline} dramatically
[**increases** the points **vulnerable to attack**]{.underline}, as does
the expected massive increase in both things connected to the network
and the data flying about it.

[**Second**, there's]{.underline} so much [**backward compatibility**
built into the 5G network that **older vulnerabilities
remain**]{.underline}. 5G is an evolution of the decade-old 4G network,
and most networks will mix generations. Without the ability to do a
clean break from 4G to 5G, it will simply be impossible to improve
security in some areas. [Attackers may be able to **force 5G systems**
to use **more vulnerable 4G protocols**]{.underline}, for example, and
5G networks
will [inherit](https://gcn.com/articles/2019/10/21/5g-security.aspx) many
existing problems.

[**Third**, the 5G standards committees missed **many opportunities** to
improve **security**]{.underline}. Many of [the new **security
features** in 5G are **optional**, and network operators can choose not
to implement them]{.underline}. The
same [happened](https://www.wired.com/story/5g-more-secure-4g-except-when-not/) with
4G; operators even ignored security features defined as mandatory in the
standard because implementing them was expensive. But even worse, for
5G, development, performance, cost, and time to market were all
prioritized over security, which was treated as an afterthought.

[Already problems are being **discovered**]{.underline}. In November
2019,
researchers [published](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/5g-flaws-locations-spoof-alerts/) [vulnerabilities](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6544575-5GReasoner.html) that
allow 5G users to be tracked in real time, be sent fake emergency
alerts, or be disconnected from the 5G network altogether. And this
wasn't the
first [reporting](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-19/Wednesday/us-19-Shaik-New-Vulnerabilities-In-5G-Networks-wp.pdf) to [find](https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/pub/2019/kim_sp_2019.pdf) [issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10360) in
5G protocols and implementations.

### Commercial\-\--AT: Too Late\-\--2AC

#### America can catch up, especially in 5G.

Monica **Alleven 21**, 4-1-21, Executive Editor @ Fierce Wireless,
https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/race-to-5g-alive-and-well-for-u-s-china//tyei

What about that 'race'?

The subject of 5G in China vs. the U.S. came up during a 5G panel last
week hosted by Chetan Sharma Consulting, with guests T-Mobile EVP of
Advanced & Emerging Technologies John Saw and Intel Corporate Vice
President Asha Keddy.

The consulting firm estimates [the U.S. had between 30 million to 40
million 5G subscribers at the end of 2020. China had about 180 million
5G subs by the end of 2020]{.underline} by Sharma's figures; its numbers
are different from China's because a good portion of its total count is
part of "5G package" customers, rather than representing 5G handsets,
and Sharma doesn't count those. Even then, China's total 5G subscriber
count is at least six times larger.

"Never underestimate China's resolve," Saw said, adding that it's
important to compare apples to apples. [Sure, China's 600,000+ 5G base
stations represent a big number, but its population is a lot larger as
well. He suggested considering the number of people served per cell
site, which is roughly the same in both situations, and in that sense,
they're neck and neck.]{.underline}

Still, ["it's really not how fast you start, **it's how well you
finish**,"]{.underline} Saw said. [The real question is who will lead in
innovation, and he would bet his money on a free market economy of the
U.S.,]{.underline} where Uber and Airbnb sprang up thanks to a strong
LTE network. "I like our chances. [I think it's looking good and looking
better for the United States,]{.underline}" he said.

In an interview, Sharma, CEO of the consulting firm, said he sees
different dimensions to the 5G race or story. "One dimension doesn't do
justice," he told Fierce.

Based on penetration, South Korea is ahead and will stay ahead because
it's a smaller country and half of the traffic is already 5G. "From that
point of view, it's clearly way ahead," he said.

However, if you take the point of view of number of subscribers, China
wins, and nobody can catch up to that. In the case of spectrum, the U.S.
has emerged the leader in making that available, although it missed a
big opportunity in mid-band spectrum for 5G, which other countries
seized earlier.

"I think [**the real test comes from what ecosystem you're able to
build**" and how that prospers over a given period of time]{.underline},
Sharma said. [That was the case with LTE]{.underline}, where the U.S.
was the leader and that fostered the development of the aforementioned
companies like Uber and Airbnb.

[The real battle is in the enterprise space, and who's going to build
their factories, highways, airports and all sorts of new applications
using 5G.]{.underline} "That's where I think China has an early start,"
in the sense that it has been experimenting and getting factories
5G-enabled earlier and faster than the U.S.

"I think [the U.S. will start to catch up]{.underline}," he said,
[noting the ecosystem that the U.S. boasts includes the likes of Apple,
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and the ecosystem around them is
vastly superior to that of China.]{.underline}

"[From an **ecosystem strength** point of view, I think the U.S. has a
better positioning]{.underline}," globally, than Chinese companies, he
said. [China doesn't have the same **global reach** for various reasons.
"I feel the strength of the U.S. ecosystem will help it stay in the game
of 5G," and in the long run, "I think the U.S. will generate more
revenue than China."]{.underline}

The 5G Security Competition

The [competitive landscape in U.S. telecommunications has traditionally
been viewed through the lenses of economics and technology]{.underline}.
The security of U.S. networks was less of a concern because
infrastructure suppliers were U.S. or European and presumed trustworthy.
Perhaps it was also assumed that U.S. wireless carriers could make U.S.
cellular networks secure by modifying or configuring equipment they
bought from suppliers. However, [5G networks are now **more complex**
and have many capabilities, settings, and possible
configurations]{.underline}. Much of this complexity is reflected in the
microchips that can be found in 5G systems. More than 80 percent of all
microchips are now made in Asia, and a growing number are made in China.
According to industry projections, by 2030, the United States will make
less than 10 percent of the world's microchips, while China and Taiwan
together will make more than 40 percent of them (Ip, 2021). Microchips
make their way into 5G products in a complex supply chain with many
steps and multiple opportunities for microchips to be compromised along
the way. [Cybersecurity risks might increase significantly when 5G is
deployed **worldwide** unless more-careful attention is paid to the
security of the 5G supply chain.]{.underline}

China has used its leading cellular telecommunication company, [Huawei,
as a means to surreptitiously collect sensitive national security,
foreign policy, and IP information around the world.]{.underline} Huawei
was caught spying on the African Union, [convicted of **stealing
software code** from U.S. companies,]{.underline} indicted by the U.S.
Department of Justice for the theft of U.S. company trade secrets, and
assessed to be capable of gathering mobile phone user data at scale
using its cellular infrastructure equipment deployed in the Netherlands
and Belgium. Huawei [is subsidized by the Chinese government in many
ways, so it can sell its 5G infrastructure products at deep discounts
that its Western competitors cannot match]{.underline}. Huawei and ZTE
might increase their penetration of the cellular network infrastructure
market as 5G is deployed globally[, providing China with significant
intelligence and illicit **economic adv**antages.]{.underline}

[Competition between the United States and China in 5G now involves
more]{.underline} than economic markets and technology leadership. Also
[at **stake** are the cybersecurity and integrity of next-generation
cellular networks.]{.underline} These three dimensions of the 5G
competition---[economics, technology, and security---are
**intertwined**.]{.underline} The [companies that lead in 5G
technologies]{.underline} might gain market share, regardless of their
security strengths or weaknesses or their trustworthiness, unless
[cybersecurity and trustworthiness are determined to outweigh technology
or economic preferences]{.underline}. Similarly, if a company can sell
5G products at lower prices than competitors can, it will likely gain
market share, unless security is made an overriding concern. An
untrustworthy company, such as Huawei, can leverage its market position
and technology to help China achieve its national security goals and
compromise the security of other nations. [The **security advantage**
that China might be able to derive from 5G networks will rely on the
market position and technological capabilities of its 5G
companies.]{.underline}

Table 7.1 summarizes our analysis of the market, technology, and
security positions of Chinese and U.S. companies in 5G, including their
access to the 5G supply chain. The table indicates where Chinese or U.S.
5G companies have a market or technology advantage (designated by AM or
AT , respectively) or a market or technology disadvantage (designated by
an DM or DT , respectively). The 5G architecture areas we considered are
network infrastructure, mobile devices, mobile device OSs, microchip
design, and microchip foundries.

[The United States currently has a relatively **weak position** in two
5G sectors---network infrastructure and microchip foundries---which are
at the very top and bottom of the 5G technology stack]{.underline}. In
the other 5G sectors, the United States has a relative advantage over or
is roughly at parity with China. In the rest of this section, we provide
justification for these assessments.

5G Network Infrastructure

[China has a global market advantage in the 5G network
infrastructure]{.underline} market because [the United States relies on
foreign suppliers]{.underline} to build the U.S. 5G network and because
Chinese companies, [Huawei and ZTE, have a significant presence in the
global market]{.underline}. Key U.S. 5G infrastructure suppliers are
European or Asian companies that might be subject to unfair competition
from Chinese companies, outside of the United States and those allied
countries that have not banned Huawei equipment in their 5G networks.

Mobile Devices

[Chinese and U.S. companies are major players in the mobile device
market]{.underline}. Apple is one of the largest and most-profitable
companies in the world because of the success of the iPhone. In the
highly competitive 5G mobile phone market, Apple and several Chinese
mobile phone makers offer a variety of 5G mobile phones. [Despite the
Huawei blacklisting, other Chinese phone makers have a greater share of
the global market than phone makers from other countries.]{.underline}

## Impacts

### Impact\-\--CI\-\--2AC

#### Collapse is [likely]{.underline} and [existential]{.underline}.

**DeNardis '21** \[Dr. Laura and Gordon M. Goldstein; March 3; PhD in
Science and Technology Studies from Virginia Tech, Dean of the School of
Communication at American University; Adjunct Senior Fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations; Lawfare, "The Real Lesson of the Texas
Power Debacle,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/real-lesson-texas-power-debacle\]

The [infrastructure was **essential**]{.underline}, ubiquitous and
[providing basic functionality for **everything in daily life** from
**water** to **heat** and **transportation**. And in an **instant** it
was **gone**]{.underline}, plunging tens of thousands of residents into
a life-threatening crisis. This is, of course, the narrative of the
recent debacle in Texas, [where a]{.underline} winter [storm overwhelmed
the]{.underline} state's electrical [**grid** and brought]{.underline}
the state to [a near-total **blackout**]{.underline}. But it should also
be interpreted as [a preemptive warning of]{.underline} what Americans
will face from [the next generation]{.underline} of the internet and the
new realm of cybersecurity risk it will dramatically amplify.

Both forms of infrastructure---a state-run electrical grid and the 5G
and "internet of things" future to which we are rapidly hurtling---share
three attributes. First, their construction reflects a lack of
imagination about the danger that can quickly coalesce when seemingly
remote threat scenarios become real. Second, compounding a lack of
analytic imagination is an absence of preparedness. Third, for both the
Texas electrical grid and the emerging internet, public policy
protections are either meager or completely absent.

In planning for the resilience of its electrical grid, public officials
in Texas discounted the potentially [devastating disruption]{.underline}
that [could occur from **unpredictable events**]{.underline}---whether
related to climate change or just a once-a-century anomaly. They also
eschewed precautions other states take seriously by allowing for the
interconnection of electrical grid supply chains across their borders,
ostensibly because of their ideological rejection of federal regulatory
oversight governing such arrangements.

As the United States builds out a new national 5G cyber-physical
communications network through private service providers,
[Americans]{.underline} similarly [**discount** the risks---**myriad**
in their **diversity** and **severity**]{.underline}---that are orders
of magnitude more significant than what Texas confronted recently. More
physical things than people are already connected. The super empowered
internet of tomorrow, known among some in the field as the "internet of
everything," will exceed by tens of billions of devices the number of
connections between individuals simply communicating via social media or
digital screens.

This confronts policymakers with an imminent threat: A cyber outage is
no longer about losing digital communications but about losing basic
societal functioning and even human life. The failure of imagination is
to think of the SolarWinds attack on U.S. federal agencies and tech
companies as a worst-case scenario. The failure of imagination is to
think of cybersecurity through a content-centric lens rather than as
possible attacks on the material world. The emergence of
internet-connected cardiac devices, digitally dependent cars, and
internet-connected agriculture systems portend the stakes of a
cyberattack to health care, economic and social functioning, and food
security.

The United States should be prepared for, and certainly not be caught by
surprise by, such cyberattacks. Yet, the internet of everything is
notoriously insecure. Internet-connected physical objects are not
necessarily upgradeable. Nor do they come with adequate default security
and encryption. The 5G infrastructure that helps connect digital objects
has been at the center of debates over Chinese espionage. Industrial
cyber-physical systems are based on technical standards that have not
been collaboratively vetted for security and interoperability. One of
the most infamous cyberattacks---the so-called Mirai botnet that took
down major media sites and corporations---hijacked these insecure
objects in homes to carry out the assault. The United States is not yet
prepared.

Finally, in the race to conceive and deploy effective public policy
responses, the U.S. government as a whole is hardly more anticipatory or
synthesized in its response to potential calamity than the state of
Texas. The focus of U.S. cyber policy remains on information policy
issues such as disinformation, manipulation and violent speech rather
than securing the digital world that now powers our material day-to-day
lives. The Biden administration confronts an enormous challenge in
crafting a comprehensive strategy to the cybersecurity risks
foreshadowed by the ruinous experience in Texas and its management of
vital infrastructure. While the digital world has leapt from
two-dimensional to three-dimensional space, cyber policy has not at all
jumped from 2D to 3D.

This failure of imagination, preparedness and policy protection must not
be America's cyber future; the stakes are far too high and the costs are
far too great. The Texas disaster is a potent illustration of what has
always been true: Our digital society and economy are extremely
vulnerable and grow more porous and subject to penetration day by day.
As digital sensors and cyber control systems become further embedded in
physical infrastructure like energy systems, agriculture and
transportation, there is no longer a separation between security of the
"real" world and security of the online world. They are entangled and
increasingly enmeshed---and policy has yet to catch up to either
envisioning or mitigating the looming threats the U.S. confronts.

If the energy grid cannot weather a winter storm, how can it be expected
to withstand a major cyberattack? What other vital forms of national
infrastructure---ranging from water, bridges, highways and roads, and
ultimately our day-to-day financial system---are comparably at risk? As
Texas dramatizes, [it is **neither hyperbolic** nor **exaggerated** to
assert that **our survival could now depend** on securing the inevitable
cyber-physical future that is accelerating with stunning
rapidity]{.underline}.

#### Causes societal [collapse]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline}.

Policies Needed to Prepare for It," vol. 38, no. 2\]

In the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted
that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or
activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do
occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out
extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this
writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is
experiencing rolling blackouts.1 Yet [even in prolonged power outages,
we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will
return to normal]{.underline}. Perhaps we need ask, [however, what if
power **cannot** be restored in a timely manner?]{.underline} Concern is
growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could
be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering
a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: [how did we reach a
point where something so **critical**]{.underline} [to **routine life**
now]{.underline} [presents an **existential threat**, and what can we do
to **mitigate** the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?]{.underline}

This article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial
control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a
level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article
argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart
catastrophic grid failure -- a paradigm that recognises the inextricable
link between commercial power generation and national security. In
section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part,
mitigate a future where [grid attacks pose **existential
risk**]{.underline} to nations and their citizenry. Those
recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme
to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more
cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial
control systems; third, institute a federally mandated
information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States
Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity
protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university
grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies
with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear
rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an
introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give
orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better
understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive
action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest
people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is
essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors,
engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many
others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this
subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid
security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire
energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences
of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for
promoting grid integrity.2 In this regard, lawyers who represent various
actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and
potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced
before.

1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world

'Black start', not to be confused with the term 'blackout', is the name
given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without
relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover
from a total or partial shutdown.3 At first glance, this description is
unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 -- how might one
restore power if the entire external transmission network is
compromised?

[If an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may
be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore
power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be
resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These **micro**
considerations hardly give **anyone pause**]{.underline}; they are
hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their 'black
start' is a quick and effective process for restoring power. [But what
happens, at a macro level, when an electric **grid** supplying power to
**large portions**]{.underline} [of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [goes black,
or]{.underline} worse, [what happens if **all**]{.underline} of the
United States' electric [grids go down **simultaneously?**]{.underline}4
In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and
transmitted to turn the United States' lights back on? Moreover, how
might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps
[the]{.underline} more **[ominous question]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} [**not how**, but **whether or not we can
survive**]{.underline} such circumstances if they persist in the long
term.

The United States electric grid ('the grid') is the 'largest
interconnected machine' in the world.5 It consists of more than 7000
power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage
transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.6 The
scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital
world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable
industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital
networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors;
many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming
code.7 Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of
generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not
inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.8 The vastness of the grid
makes security of it challenging. Likewise, [the **vastness** of the
grid makes the opportunities for intrusion **seemingly
infinite**]{.underline}.

[By **any measure**, grid **failure** will unleash a **parade of
horrors**. **Stores** would **close**, **food** scarcity would follow,
**communication** would cease, **garbage** would **pile up**, planes
would be grounded, clean **water** would become a **luxury**, service
stations would yield **no fuel**, **hospitals** would]{.underline}
eventually **[go dark]{.underline}**, financial
**[transactions]{.underline}** [would stop, and this is only the **tip
of the iceberg**]{.underline} -- in a prolonged grid failure **[social
chaos]{.underline}** [would reign, once-eradicated **diseases**
would]{.underline} **[re-emerge]{.underline}** [and]{.underline},
increasingly, [hope of returning to a normal life would
fade]{.underline}.9 The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated
to science fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible
but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.10

3\. Fragility and Systemic Risk

As [**tech**nologies]{.underline} develop, they [often]{.underline}
**[build on]{.underline}** [one another, so that the continued operation
of the]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [depends on a growing set
of]{.underline} [**other s**ystems. The way]{.underline} that
[failure]{.underline} occurs and **[propagates]{.underline}** [in such
systems is]{.underline} [**non-obvious**, but]{.underline} it [is
largely dependent on the]{.underline} **[topology of]{.underline}** the
**[interdependence]{.underline}** between components. Pastor-Satorras,
Castellano, Van Mieghem, and Vespignani (2015) **[Simple]{.underline}**
[dependencies, where a system **requires**]{.underline} [the functioning
of every component, can make the resulting **system of systems** **more
fragile**]{.underline} [than the components]{.underline}. A very basic
model of this shows that given a system-of-systems with N components,
each of which independently can fail at the rate Fi the failure rate is
![Text Description automatically
generated](media/image3.png){width="0.8462128171478566in"
height="0.19897965879265092in"}. [While this grows more slowly than the
sum of the individual failure rates as new systems are added, it is also
far higher than the average failure rate of those individual
systems.]{.underline}

[As a concrete **example**, the peak of]{.underline} **[efficient
farming]{.underline}** [once required]{.underline} **[family
farms]{.underline}** [to depend on a]{.underline}
**[family]{.underline}** to manage the farm, [a]{.underline}
**[blacksmith]{.underline}** to make horseshoes and plows,
[and]{.underline} draft **[animals]{.underline}** to pull them. Losing
any one of these would be enough to (eventually) make the system unable
to continue, and there was some risk that this would occur. Still, [the
limited number of inputs and]{.underline} the
[substitutability]{.underline} of other inputs [made such systems
fairly]{.underline} **[stable]{.underline}** - [especially
because]{.underline} many [risks were]{.underline}
**[uncorrelated]{.underline}** [across farms, and could often be
addressed by borrowing]{.underline} from other farms nearby.

The [farms of today]{.underline}, of course, [are]{.underline} **[not
nearly]{.underline}** [as simple. They require everything from
**satellite GPS**]{.underline} systems to pinpoint locations,
[to]{.underline} the **[semiconductors]{.underline}** and fabrication
plants used [to make]{.underline} specific **[integrated
chips]{.underline}** used in the farm equipment, [to]{.underline}
**[internet]{.underline}** connectivity [to run]{.underline} **[machine
learning]{.underline}** algorithms [using collected data and satellite
imagery]{.underline} on remote servers. Zubarev, Fomin, and Zubarev
(2019) [Modern agribusiness depends on everything from finding and
hiring]{.underline} **[skilled laborers]{.underline}** to manage complex
machinery, [to managing regulatory, financial, and other factors
critical to farm operation]{.underline}. Kingwell (2011) [These
are]{.underline} often more **[tightly correlated]{.underline}** [across
an economy, **increasing**]{.underline} [risk. Beyond that, managing
these farms requires understanding "human, technical, economic,
financial, risk, institutional and social" issues]{.underline}, as Lewis
et al. noted more than a decade ago. Lewis, Malcolm, and Steed (2006)

[The risk is]{.underline} likely [not yet]{.underline} [**critical**,
but]{.underline} it seems clear that [**dependence is growing**, and the
ability to use]{.underline} **[backup]{.underline}**
system**[s]{.underline}** [can be]{.underline} **[lost]{.underline}**.
For example, [if remote servers become unavailable, local corn farms may
lack the information needed to decide where to increase and decrease
watering]{.underline} levels, [or even lose]{.underline} the [ability to
run their computer-controlled irrigation]{.underline} systems.
Similarly, decades ago supplies and ordering were managed on paper, and
now, without the servers running Software-as-a-Service
supply-chain-management software, the dairy farm down the road may not
have access to an inventory of their supplies or know what amounts of
products are needed or what they have historically ordered, and end up
unable to feed their cows.

The inter-dependencies in such systems are more complex than the above
model allows, but more complex analyses, such as those employing
percolation analysis to understand mutual interdependency of multiple
networks, Buldyrev, Parshani, Gerald Paul, Stanley, and Havlin (2010)
show the same trend. That is, **[interdependent]{.underline}** [systems
where failures]{.underline} can **[propagate]{.underline}** can be
**[far more likely]{.underline}** to **[fail]{.underline}** than the
average rate at which the individual systems' components fail. Worse,
analysis of "high--value, technology-- and engineering--intensive
products or systems...used to produce consumer goods and services" has
shown that the failure rates are nearly-additive, and worse, are hard to
identify. Yeo and Ren (2009)

It should be noted that modern computer networks do not display such
fragility, but this is a function of intentional design. Metcalfe and
Boggs (1976) Simple network structures, such as lines or rings, are far
more prone to failure Clark, Pogran, and Reed (1978). That is, unless a
system was designed for resilience, resilience should not be expected.
And when technological systems are made efficient and complex, they tend
to be tightly coupled - meaning that failure in one place spreads
Bookstaber (2007).

3.1. Inevitable Technological Fragility Hypothesis

The proposal of this paper, to provide an addendum to Bostrom\'s
hypothesis, is that if technological development continues indefinitely,
**[systemic fragility]{.underline}** [will increase to the point
that]{.underline} the possibility of [a **shock**]{.underline}
[sufficient for]{.underline} **[complete collapse]{.underline}**
[approaches]{.underline} certainty.

This hypothesis rests on a number of assumptions, but there are also a
variety of reasons to find it plausible and concerning. To lay these out
clearly, we will first consider the question of how and why individual
systems are fragile, then make an argument that it is at least plausible
that the multiple interconnected systems and systems-of-systems which
are necessary for much of modern civilization not only fail to address
this risk, but multiply it.

4\. Single-System Complexity and Fragility

The key question so far is whether fragility increases over time as
systems are built. The answer to that question depends on a combination
of factors that can push in either direction. These include increasing
complexity of systems, the economic incentives for efficiency over
robustness and the resulting levels of investment in resilience, the
failure rates of individual components and systems, as well as the way
in which systems-of-systems (and systems-of-systems-of-systems) are
interrelated, and the extent to which systems and their
interdependencies are designed to be robust.

Even the claim of inevitable fragility in individual systems makes
several assumptions about how fragility increases. Before looking at the
systemic question of how fragility could lead to collapse, we will
outline these assumptions. Note that these are in fact assumptions,
rather than claims - if any one of them is false in ways that are
outlined, it would refute the hypothesis. The third assumption is
particularly critical, and will be explored further in the next
subsection.

First, for fragility to matter, the current trend of
efficiency-increasing and resilience-decreasing technologies must
continue to apply to at least one critical system, such as agriculture,
communication, or transport. If this is wrong, and future white-ball /
safe exploration technologies are ones that favor robustness over
efficiency in all such critical domains, the trend would reverse. For
instance, distributed fault tolerant computing arguably increases both
efficiency and robustness. Most new technologies move in the opposite
direction, but if enough resilience increasing technology is found, the
balance could shift.

Second, the argument for increasing fragility assumes that economic
growth continues to absorb human effort in a way that does not lead to
overabundant resources. In Eric Drexler\'s 'Paretotopia' scenario,
increased resources are unmatched by increased demand. Drexler (2019) In
that future case, resources are abundant enough that robustness is easy
to achieve. This second scenario also assumes the absence of
supercharged competition that uses the newly abundant resources. This
would not occur, for example, in Hanson\'s proposed default "Em"
scenario, where human-based intelligences are simulated computationally,
leading to a reduction rather than an increase in surplus that could be
redirected to robustness for lack of other needs. Hanson (2016)

Third, it assumes that fragility is relatively hard to identify, such
that at least some failures will be unanticipated. This has been true
historically, but it is possible that future developments would reverse
this trend, making the search for increased robustness itself efficient
enough to counterbalance the more general and destabilizing increased
fragility that new technology allows. If failures do become easy to
anticipate, more expensive general resilience can be replaced with more
specific redundancies targeted to the exact failure modes identified.

4.1. Non-Obvious Fragility

As mentioned, hard-to-identify fragility is a key assumption. Broadly
speaking, non-obvious fragility is the result of planning for
efficiency, instead of designing for redundancy, fault tolerance, or
even provable safety. This is a fairly general fact about any control
system. Paattilammi and Makila (2000) The concrete result of the current
optimization shows clear signs of producing fragile results. One example
is the proliferation of disposable technology, such as fragile
smartphones designed to be replaced rather than fixed or upgraded.
Failure of these optimized devices is normal, and while mitigating
failure is important, it is often the case that risk must be accepted,
rather than avoided. Perrow (2011) This type of fragility is obvious and
anticipated, rather than non-obvious and worrying. For example,
individual computers are fragile, and components fail frequently. For
this reason, in high-reliability computer systems, a variety of
mechanisms are in place to compensate, including redundant online
systems for data storage, Chen, Lee, Gibson, Katz, and Patterson (1994)
or methods to address other hardware failures. Wang, Zhang, and Xu
(2017)

The fact that computer networks are not fragile, and the fragility that
does exist is well understood, seems to be a counterexample. But the
resilience itself is planned, in contrast to ecological systems where it
is emergent - as we will discuss in detail below. This means that
fault-tolerant designs are built to be tolerant of expected faults. Not
only that, but resilience itself is optimized, for example, to minimize
the number of backups or other costs needed to have a planned level of
reliability. Rodrigues-da Silva and Crispim (2014) This creates
fragility to unexpected faults, and allows the systems to operate
through anticipated contingencies, but not to anything beyond that
point.

4.2. Sociotechnical Resilience

Fragility of systems is not based purely on the lack of resilience of
technical systems. In fact, fragility of optimized technical systems is
compensated for by the greater robustness of sociological systems. The
combined sociotechnical system, then, is the level at which fragility
should be considered.

To reduce the fragility of sociotechnical systems, organizations can
attempt to build more resilience at the organizational level. This can
involve information sharing, distributed decision making, and better
risk assessment. If done well, these attempts provide a sociotechnical
system that compensates for technical and operation risk, but is again
very different from emergent resilience. Langeland, Manheim, Mcleod, and
Nacouzi (2016) Unfortunately, the interaction between humans and
technology can often multiply risks, rather than mitigate them. Yeo and
Ren (2009)

Another reason to think that sociotechnical resilience will not fully
compensate for technological fragility is the reduced human involvement
in technical systems. As automation increases, Danzig notes that humans
are increasingly necessarily out-of-the-loop. Danzig (2018) He further
argues that when there is competition, this dynamic is a necessary
result of continued optimization.

To conclude the discussion of single-system fragility, we note that
inevitable fragility of systems is not actually required for the
hypothesis presented. As this section argued, it does seem plausible
that in expectation, new technologies will be more fragile than those
they replace. However, [systemic risk can exist given the much weaker
claim that specific critical systems are relied upon, and technological
improvements relevant to those systems alone exhibit sufficient
**fragility** to cause a **cascading collapse**]{.underline}. Before
discussing the interaction between systems, however, it is worth
considering how these human, technical, or sociotechnical systems differ
from naturally resilient biological systems.

### Impact\-\--China 5G\-\--2AC

#### China 5G dominance causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

Elsa **Kania 19**, Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Technology and National
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, 11/7/2019,
\"Securing Our 5G Future,\" No Publication,
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/securing-our-5g-future>

[**China's** quest for **5G dominance**]{.underline} has played out
within a complex technological and geopolitical landscape.108 Indeed,
[different countries have their own security concerns and
considerations, but not all share American assessments of the severity
of these risks. Insofar as American policymakers see China as a great
power rival and strategic competitor, allowing Chinese companies to play
a key role in American **critical infrastructure**, or that of U.S.
**allies** and partners, presents **grave threats** that are untenable
and unacceptable for the United States, not only espionage but also
outright subversion of this critical infrastructure.]{.underline}109
[Yet Huawei has continued to expand its global presence, and the U.S.
government has yet to present a viable and attractive alternative to
working with Huawei]{.underline}. Many countries may have sunk costs and
be "locked in" already to this choice based on earlier decisions, which
raises concerns about not only security but also fair competition.110
However, it is encouraging to see emerging consensus among like-minded
countries about potential principles and shared approaches to 5G
security, particularly through the progress of a recent conference on 5G
security in Prague.111

The age of 5G will present new risks and novel threats of disruption or
exploitation. [5G]{.underline} involves far more than just new and
faster wireless networks; it [will be a **vital component** of future
**critical infrastructure**.]{.underline} Consequently, [the
**cybersecurity** of 5G networks could prove uniquely **challenging**,
considering the high levels of **complexity** and much **greater
potential for damage** in the case of an attack. Not only the
confidentiality of data on 5G networks but also questions of integrity
and assurance will become urgent challenges. Whereas most cyberattacks
to date have involved only data theft, an attack against future 5G
networks could cause **massive damage** that might threaten public
safety and critical industries in future smart cities]{.underline}.112
[The often subpar security of IoT devices, of which there are an
estimated 20 billion globally and growing, also presents serious reasons
for concern.]{.underline} A high proportion of devices on the U.S.
market have been made in China by companies with very poor track records
on security.113 While vulnerabilities have been and remain a major
concern in the telecom industry for 3G and 4G, the stakes will be even
higher for securing 5G networks at all stages of their life cycles.114
In some cases, [**supply chains could be weaponized** deliberately by
adversaries that may prefer **to "win without
fighting."**]{.underline}115 [The exclusion of high-risk
vendors]{.underline} is an important measure to mitigate risk but [does
not constitute a complete solution.]{.underline}

5G must be designed and implemented with a holistic approach to security
in mind from the start. The development of secure networks must entail
more than simply excluding high-risk vendors, requiring rigorous,
ongoing testing and screening. Indeed, careful scrutiny should be
extended to all aspects of the production, construction, and management
of these networks, involving screening of the security of all vendors
and carriers. If an end-to-end approach to security is effectively
implemented, 5G could prove more secure than our existing networks and
critical infrastructure, but the consequences of insecurity would be far
graver. In public debates on 5G security, the call and search for a
"smoking gun" has been problematic. This framing of the issue has often
distracted policymakers from thinking about the greater challenge of
mitigating vulnerabilities that tend to be pervasive. Bugs can be just
as problematic as backdoors. It is inherently challenging to
differentiate an accidental vulnerability from one that is deliberately
introduced. The primary difference is intent, which cannot be discerned
from code alone. It is encouraging that the 3GPP's SA3 working group is
focusing on security, seeking to ensure that such security concerns will
shape the development of standards.116 However, industry and government
are just starting to grapple with the full range of issues in play.

Given the gravity of these security challenges, [the]{.underline}
apparent [centrality of Chinese companies in the global development of
5G has raised intense concerns. There is a very real risk that
vulnerabilities in networks,]{.underline} whether the result of poor
security practices or deliberate introduction of backdoors, [could be
weaponized for leverage or coercive purposes, particularly in a crisis
or conflict scenario. Considering China's history of IP theft and
cyberespionage, there is also a real risk such networks could be
exploited for purposes of **espionage**]{.underline}.117 As a Chinese
company, Huawei also would be subject to a number of legal demands,
regulatory requirements, and mechanisms of coercion that are often
ambiguous and expansive.118 Regardless of whether Huawei's leadership
may wish to disregard an order from the Chinese government, [China lacks
an independent judiciary system for company leaders to plead their case
against the government, as Apple did in the United States when it fought
an FBI order to unlock an iPhone. Huawei's claims that it would "say no"
to the Chinese government are not credible without indications of the
company's actual ability to do so.]{.underline}

[Even if Huawei is given the full benefit of the doubt]{.underline},
despite its history and apparent involvement with the Chinese military
and intelligence organizations, [Huawei's products and services have
been assessed to be highly **insecure**, with a much greater prevalence
of vulnerabilities relative to their primary
competitors]{.underline}.119 Moreover, [there are reasons to question
whether **knowledge of** any **bugs** in its equipment could be
**shared** more readily with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS).
This risk may be heightened given the influence of MSS in China's
vulnerabilities database, not to mention Huawei's historical and
continued linkages to the Chinese **P**eople's **L**iberation **A**rmy,
including military intelligence.]{.underline}120 [For the United States,
these risks and security concerns are **inextricable** from today's
**geopolitical exigencies**, insofar as the U.S.-China rivalry
encompasses **scenarios for** which there is a nonzero probability of
**conflict**, including over **Taiwan**]{.underline}. Consistently,
[**Chinese military writings** have highlighted the potential for
**cyberattacks on critical infrastructure** as a **prelude to** outright
**war**fare.]{.underline}121 [The presence of equipment from high-risk
vendors, such as **Huawei**, even in **rural telecoms** is concerning,
considering that some of these **networks are near military bases**,
which raises risks of espionage or exploitation.]{.underline}

5G security presents a global challenge that will demand creative and
cooperative solutions. Huawei will likely remain a major player in 5G in
a number of countries, including some U.S. allies and partners, that
believe the benefits of partnering with it outweigh the risks. Although
a criteria-based calculation of risk provides compelling arguments for
exclusion of such highly risky players, many nations could still
continue current collaborations with Huawei in ways that exacerbate
global risks to this emergent ecosystem. [**Even if** the **U**nited
**S**tates were to succeed in **fully secur**ing its own 5G networks,
U.S. data and entities may remain **reliant**, including for military
and commercial activities, upon **overseas digital infrastructure** that
could prove highly **vulnerable**.The presence of Huawei's equipment in
the critical infrastructure of U.S. **allies** and partners, whose
support or **location** as a **staging ground** the U.S. military might
require to fulfill its **treaty obligations** in the event of a crisis
or **conflict**, also creates new risks, to an extent that could
**undermine U.S.** capabilities for command and control and **power
projection**.]{.underline} As Dan Coats, had warned during his time as
director of national intelligence (DNI), ["U.S. data will increasingly
flow across foreign-produced equipment and foreign-controlled networks,
raising the risk of **foreign access** and **denial of
service**."]{.underline} 122

### Impact\-\--Democracy\-\--2AC

#### China 5G enables [digital authoritarianism]{.underline} and collapses [democracy]{.underline}.

National Democratic Institute and a Truman National Security Fellow; and

RMax

[**Biden's plan** is an important step to combating China's rising
influence. **But** it needs to prioritize **tech**nology **more**,
especially **5G**, which is carrying the world into the **next era** of
the internet. The]{.underline} B3W [plan **doesn't**]{.underline}
explicitly [mention 5G, even though that technology is beginning to
transform how we communicate and live by expanding information access,
automating everyday services, and advancing smart cities and
policing]{.underline}. Essentially, 5G has the power to affect all four
areas of the B3W plan, and how it is built, used, and governed can tip
the scales in favor of authoritarianism or democracy in any given
country. The G-7 should recognize 5G's power---and the risks it poses in
the wrong hands---by making 5G a central thread that ties its
infrastructure plan together and promoting it in B3W.

In recent years, the U.S. security community has woken up to the threats
of [the Chinese Communist Party's]{.underline} technology agenda. The
party's [approach centers on **two tactics**]{.underline}: a series of
[laws that require Chinese companies, including those providing services
**abroad**, to give Beijing **unfettered access** to **data** and the
**global export of 5G hardware**. Chinese business leaders go to other
countries bearing **inexpensive hardware** and the **promise** of
economic advancement]{.underline}, all [for the price of **control over
data** that can be accessed by Beijing or local **authoritarian
regimes**]{.underline}.

[5G is]{.underline} an [easy]{.underline} tool [to
**weaponize**]{.underline}. As demand for it grows worldwide, [citizens
and infrastructure are becoming **increasingly reliant** on
it]{.underline}. As of February, 131 countries announced plans to invest
in 5G, which will be foundational for future internet technologies. Like
the internet and social media, **[5G]{.underline}** promises greater
access to information. But it also [allows **more data** to be gathered
than **ever before**, and any 5G-backed technology can expedite and
expand the scope and scale of what people---and **governments**---can do
with that information]{.underline}.

[5G adoption in a country inclined toward authoritarianism makes
**autocrats more efficient**]{.underline}. In those countries,
[decision-making around 5G adoption occurs almost exclusively in
**executive branches**]{.underline} of government [with]{.underline}
little to [**no oversight**, giving leaders **broad control** over
**data flow** and **governance**]{.underline}. As a result, [**mass
surveillance** can ensue, as well as large-scale human rights abuses
through automated **discrimination**, **censorship**, and
**persecution**]{.underline}---[much like what is taking place against
**Uyghurs** in China]{.underline}'s Xinjiang region.
[Leaders]{.underline} with access to 5G-backed artificial intelligence
capabilities and real-time citizen information [are able to employ
**subversive disinfo**rmation **campaigns** with **greater reach** to
fuel **violent polarization**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, internet
shutdowns only increase in frequency and target political opponents,
dissidents, and journalists, which has already happened in Myanmar,
Kashmir, Chad, and Nigeria.

Already, [the export of **Chinese technologies**]{.underline} and tools
[to Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia has coincided with a
**rise** of **digital authoritarianism**. It has given
**dictators**]{.underline}, including Venezuela's Nicolás [**Maduro**
and]{.underline} Uganda's Yoweri [**Museveni**, broader control over
**everything**]{.underline} from data flow to airwaves. Parliament
buildings have been wired, political opponents threatened, and
[citizens surveilled and censored using technologies produced and
serviced by **Chinese companies**]{.underline}, such as Huawei and ZTE.

[**But** that doesn't mean 5G is **inherently dangerous**.
**Democracies** have every reason to pursue the technological promise of
5G, as increased data capacity can make states **more efficient** and
help governments deliver on services]{.underline}. Public utilities, for
instance, could be made greener through automated regulation with 5G
technology. Perhaps the greatest promise of 5G, though, is that it
enables more people to access digital technologies. By delivering 5G to
marginalized communities, which face a growing digital divide that
especially affects women and rural areas, countries can increase
opportunity for greater information flow, access to education tools, and
other societal benefits.

In healthy democracies, the oversight of these technologies should
respect human rights and privacy and shouldn't be conducted behind
closed doors. Companies, civil society actors, and the general public
should work with the government to create rules around data in a
transparent way. The good news is that Biden's B3W plan makes clear that
he understands the importance of technology in shaping the norms of the
international system to embrace human rights and putting decision-making
in the hands of many stakeholders. But [the clock is
**ticking**]{.underline}.

Right now, China offers cheap technology to telecommunications providers
in countries with few regulations around transparency and
multi-stakeholder engagement. G-7 countries can't simply subsidize
rights-respecting companies and expect them to be competitive in those
markets. Instead, they must work together across regions to implement
global standards and practices around the security of 5G equipment and
5G ecosystems and the flow and control of data, especially as it
pertains to data privacy, internet freedom, and human rights. They also
need to increase investments into future-generation technologies and
incentivize 5G development in marginalized communities worldwide to
address current digital, social, and economic inequality. [If they act
**too slowly**, they'll **cede** the digital landscape to **Beijing**
and its **authoritarian friends**]{.underline}. It is a tremendous
challenge, but the G-7 [**democracies** are poised for **great success**
if they **work together**]{.underline}.

[For **now**]{.underline}, though, [an effective global plan to
influence conversations around **technology** and **democracy**---and
**5G's role** in them---remains **absent**]{.underline}. For instance,
clear international consequences for digital rights violations are
nonexistent. One promising framework for the United States' approach to
technology leadership and global cooperation was laid out at the Global
Emerging Technology Summit this week by U.S. National Security Advisor
Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. In the fall, the
United Kingdom will host the Future Tech Forum, the Danish government
will hold a technology conference, and the Czech government will convene
a 5G conference. These events will be invaluable in the fight to drive
the world toward a cooperative, values-based approach to technology
governance. As the international community continues to take these
issues seriously, the United States and regional leaders worldwide will
need to set global standards and ensure that the technology
infrastructure market has more diverse vendors, affordable equipment
options, and research and development investments that create secure
technologies. Governments must work with private companies, think tanks,
and civil society to ensure that these changes are more than a pipe
dream.

[Technology is **inseparable** from the **future** of
**democracy**]{.underline}, and [Biden's]{.underline} B3W [effort is the
**first step** in the long road to developing these global technology
standards that prioritize and protect]{.underline} data
**[privacy]{.underline}**, open digital spaces, and human rights. [What
Biden needs to acknowledge is that technologies and infrastructures
reliant on insecure **5G networks** in particular have **great potential
to harm democracy**.]{.underline} A central question for our time is how
successful democracies can be maintained and strengthened as the
internet pervades more and more of citizens' daily lives. Focusing on 5G
will have the most immediate impact---and curtail the worst results.

The 5G Technology Race

[The nation that **leads** in]{.underline} developing and widely
deploying [**5G tech**nology will have an **important first-mover
advantage**, with]{.underline} both [**economic** and **national
security implications**]{.underline}. Chinese national champion
[**Huawei** is the current **global leader** in **5G**]{.underline}, and
[China's **ZTE** is also a **major player** in the industry. Huawei is
**aggressively pursuing export** of its **5G systems** to install
digital infrastructure **around the globe**]{.underline}. Huawei is an
attractive option to many nations because it is cheaper than its
competitors. The products of firms competing with Chinese companies will
be more expensive because of unfair subsidies from the Chinese Communist
Party, which artificially reduce prices.

[Huawei is a **tool** of **state power** and a critical asset in China's
**global**]{.underline} economic and [geopolitical competitions and
ambitions. Huawei faces competition from Samsung]{.underline} USA [and
others]{.underline} as an end-to-end producer, [and still other
companies produce **5G components**]{.underline} (such as antennae,
chips, and base station architecture) including Ericsson, Nokia, and
Qualcomm. [These firms]{.underline} are more expensive because they are
not the beneficiaries of unfair state subsidies. However, they
[offer]{.underline} other advantages, including [enhanced security, more
rigorous training of personnel, protection of intellectual property, and
privacy. From a national security perspective, this race is not about US
commercial market share, but rather **mitigating** China's ability to
**influence US allies** and **security partners**]{.underline}.

Why is 5G Important for National Security?

[If China controls the digital infrastructure of the 21st century, it
will **exploit** this **position** for its **national security
purposes** and be capable of coercive leverage over the United States
and **allies**. These networks will process **all** manner of data, and
China certainly will use the network to conduct espionage on the United
States and allies for **national security** and industrial purposes. It
will allow for the emplacement of "**backdoors**"]{.underline} in
networks [that could be activated to conduct **catastrophic
cyberattacks** on US and allied **"smart cities"** in the event of
conflict]{.underline}. Put another way, [Huawei's 5G]{.underline}
technology [is the 21stcentury]{.underline} version of the mythological
[**Trojan Horse**. The spread of Chinese 5G]{.underline} networks [will
threaten **NATO** and **allied interoperability**]{.underline}, as [the
United States will become **unable** and **unwilling** to integrate its
secure 5G network with **any** aspect of Chinese systems]{.underline}.

Finally, [this race, and its outcome, rises to the level of importance
of]{.underline} such projects as [the **Manhattan Project** and the
'**man on the moon'**]{.underline} efforts of the 20th century.
[21st-century **security**]{.underline}, both public and private, [will
be **profoundly affected**]{.underline} by the decisions taken in the
next few months.

For countries who select the Chinese alternative and the consequences
attendant to such a decision, the costs of reversal will increase
exponentially as they proceed. For these reasons, the United States and
several close allies (the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan,
Canada, Poland, France, and others) have either banned or are
considering bans on Huawei 5G systems. However, many other states,
including US allies, have installed or are considering installing
Huawei's networks.

[This is an **urgent problem** that will shape]{.underline} economies
and [societies for future generations]{.underline}. The infrastructure
investment decisions that will determine the future 5G architecture will
be made in the coming weeks and months, not years.

[By the **mid-twenty-first century** the world's cities will
be]{.underline} [home]{.underline} to approaching [**eight billion
inhabitants** and will carpet an area]{.underline} of the planet's
surface [**the size of China**.]{.underline} Several megacities will
have 20, 30, and even 40 million people. The largest city on Earth will
be Guangzhou-Shenzen, which already has an estimated 120 million
citizens crowded into in its greater metropolitan area (Vidal 2010 ).

By the 2050s [these colossal conurbations will absorb **4.5 trillion

preservation of a **precarious balance** between the **essential
resources**]{.underline} they need [for **survival**]{.underline} and
growth---[and the **capacity of the Earth** to supply them.]{.underline}
Furthermore, they will generate equally phenomenal volumes of waste,
reaching an alpine 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 ( World Bank )---an
average of six million tonnes a day---and probably doubling again by the
2050s, in line with economic demand for material goods and food. In the
words of the Global Footprint Network "[The **global effort** for

cities]{.underline}" (Global Footprint Network 2015).

As we have seen in the case of food (Chap. 7), [these giant cities exist

[Cities around the world are getting **smarter**]{.underline}. A growing
number even designated themselves "smart cities." There are, of course,
as many definitions of smart cities as there are cities professing to be
smart. Very generally, [**smart cities** deploy a host of information
communication technologies]{.underline}---including high-speed
communication networks, sensors, and mobile phone apps---[to boost
**mobility** and **connectivity**, supercharge the **digital economy**,
increase **energy efficiency**, improve the **delivery of services**,
and generally **raise** the level of their **residents'
welfare**]{.underline}. Becoming "smart" typically involves harnessing
troves of data to optimize city functions---from more efficient use of
utilities and other services to reducing traffic congestion and
pollution---all with a view to empowering public authorities and
residents.

However one defines them, [data-enabled cities are
**booming**]{.underline}. By one estimate, [there are over a
**thousand** smart city projects underway **around the world**. Rankings
and indices are]{.underline} also [**proliferating**, with such cities
as Singapore, Helsinki, Seoul, and Zurich routinely topping the
list]{.underline}. Notwithstanding [**global enthusiasm** for
**hyperconnected cities**]{.underline}, this futuristic wired urban
world has a dark side. What's more, the pitfalls may soon outweigh the
supposed benefits.

## AT: 5G Bad

### 5G Bad\-\--2AC

#### 5G is safer than current technology\-\--other devices emit more power. 

Paul **Lee et al 20** (Paul Lee is a UK Partner and the Global Head of
Research for the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT)
industry at Deloitte. 12-7-2020, \"5g health risks debunked,\" Deloitte

[**Extremely low power**, **extremely low risk**]{.underline}

Of course, nonionizing radiation is not always completely harmless. The
most common form of nonionizing radiation is [visible
light,]{.underline} which [has a higher energy level than radio
waves.]{.underline} An excess of visible light---or even radio
waves---can produce heat, and in extreme cases cause burns and body
tissue damage. However, the power behind the radiofrequency radiation
generated by mobile networks is controlled and poses virtually no risk
to consumers.

[Power transmission from]{.underline} mobile telephony, including [5G,
is **far lower than** that from **light bulbs**, **TV**, **radio
towers**, or even **sunlight** on an overcast day.]{.underline} The
quantity of this power is [measured in watts]{.underline}, and a single
watt is a tiny quantity of energy. The power transmitted by the mobile
phones used in 2021 and into the foreseeable future can reach up to two
watts, depending on the age of the phone; [it can be as low as 0.001
watt]{.underline}, with the vast majority of devices in use this year
peaking at 1 watt. By comparison, the power transmitted by [CB
radios]{.underline}, which have been in use for decades, [reaches up to
four watts]{.underline}.8

As with a car journey, the shorter the distance, the less the power
required. A phone held next to the head or kept in a pocket would have
the greatest impact. The radiation level from a phone or speaker placed
on a table near the user would be lower. A smartphone will transmit more
power when base stations are relatively distant, but most smartphones
are used predominantly indoors, and tend to be connected to Wi-Fi
routers (which are effectively miniature base stations), which are often
mere meters away. In all of these cases, the amount of power transmitted
is minimal---certainly much lower than required to be harmful. Further,
a smartphone transmits power only when sending or receiving data, a
mechanism designed to prolong battery life.

The power generated by mobile network base stations is similarly low. A
base station's transmissions range in power from a quarter of a watt for
a small cell (which would often be indoors and cover a small range) to
200 watts9 for a minority of 5G base stations.10 More typically, an
outdoor base station with the greatest range would have a power output
of between 10 and 100 watts. The output of indoor base stations, which
usually have a range of hundreds of meters or less, is much lower.11

As with a phone, a base station's power level declines with distance
from its transmitter. An individual 100 meters away from a 5G macrocell
antenna located at 30 meters' height would absorb less than one
microwatt (one-thousandth of a watt) of power.12 When one is directly
next to a base station supporting any generation of mobile standard (not
just 5G), exposure limits may be exceeded.13 But these areas are
inaccessible to the public, sometimes because of their height (20 meters
or higher for larger sites), their location (often at the top of
buildings), or their design (because the units are enclosed). In the
case of indoor base stations, excessive exposure would only happen
within a few centimeters of the transmitter.

Average broadcast transmission power has declined as the number of base
stations deployed has increased, resulting in a smaller distance between
base stations and users. Transmitter power levels for 1G and 2G networks
were far more powerful, on average, than those used for 4G or 5G, since
1G and 2G transmitters covered a far greater range, often tens of
kilometers in each direction. In contrast, 4G and 5G masts in city
centers and other traditionally congested areas may cover just 100
meters.

It is worth reiterating how minuscule a watt is. An incandescent bulb,
which radiates light via a wire filament that is heated until it glows,
is rated between 25 to 200 watts. In domestic settings, people may be
less than half a meter away from a light bulb. A person this distance
from a 25-watt bulb would be exposed to thousands of times more
radiation than an individual who was 10 meters (unusually close) to a
relatively high-powered 5G base station.14 This is not just the case in
2021---it should hold true always. Similarly, people absorb five times
more radio frequency exposure from FM radio and television broadcasts
than from mobile network base stations.15 The broadcaster transmitter
power levels used for TV and FM radio can reach up to 100,000 watts.16
For AM radio, the transmission power may reach 500,000 watts.17

[Humans have coexisted with incandescent light bulbs, and their
radiation, since the 1880s with no]{.underline} known malign
[effects]{.underline} (except, of course, from being burnt from touching
a lit bulb). As for broadcast power, the first television station went
on the air in 1928,18 and the first commercial radio station launched in
192019---yet no reliable account of people being harmed by the radiation
these stations generate has ever been reported.

[5G is even **safer than previous** mobile network
**gen**]{.underline}eration**[s]{.underline}**

In 2021, consumers who are concerned about the health impacts of mobile
networks are likely to be most worried about 5G, the latest generation
of mobile technology. However, in some ways, 5G is likely to have even
[lower potential health impacts than earlier generations of mobile
telephony.]{.underline}

[5G has been designed to use less power than previous
gen]{.underline}erations to reduce operational costs; as a result[, it
**emits less power** as well]{.underline}. This is accomplished via the
new, advanced radio and core architecture used in the 5G standard, with
5G networks assisting 5G devices in minimizing power transmit levels.20
5G base stations also can be put into sleep mode when there are no
active users (for example, at night). This capability is not available
with 4G networks, which transmit control signals even when there are no
users in range.21

[5G]{.underline} also [incorporates]{.underline} a technique known as
**[beamforming]{.underline}**, an approach that involves [directing a
narrow beam of radio waves to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} user
[device]{.underline} (such as a smartphone). This method is equivalent
to directing a narrow beam of light from a pocket flashlight at a
target, focusing the radio waves on the device. This method not only
[enables higher connection speeds]{.underline}, but [also leads to lower
radio wave exposure than prior network generations]{.underline}, which
would often spread radio waves across a wide arc, similar to a car's
headlight.

Some people may conflate the risks associated with beamforming with
industrial-grade laser beams. A manufacturing-grade laser beam, which is
100 million times as powerful as a typical laser pointer, is capable of
melting steel.23 But beamforming in 5G networks [involves innocuous
levels of power]{.underline}.

As a final note, tests of 5G sites in 2020 by regulators such as Ofcom
in the United Kingdom have found that their [**EMF levels are** well
within]{.underline} International Commission on Non-[Ionizing Radiation
Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines]{.underline}.24 ICNIRP is an independent
scientific commission based in Germany that works with the World Health
Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the
European Commission. The highest EMF level recorded among the 22
locations tested was [1.5% of the acceptable level]{.underline}---in
other words, **[98.5% below the acceptable level.]{.underline}** Most of
the sites tested supported four generations of mobile technology; that
is, a combination of 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G (in many markets, 5G-only base
stations remain relatively rare). At all of these sites, 5G contributed
the least to the EMF fields measured. In 19 of the 22 locations, the
highest 5G band value was less than 0.01% of the acceptable ICNIRP
level.

### 5G Bad\-\--AT: Bees\-\--2AC

#### 5G doesn\'t harm bees - their studies are based on [incomplete data]{.underline}

**McAfee 19** \[Alison McAfee is a honey bee scientist and a science
writer; \"Why We Shouldn't Fear 5G\"; 10-1-2019; American Bee Journal;
https://americanbeejournal.com/why-we-shouldnt-fear-5g/\]//AShah

Adoption of [5G cell phone networks will lead to more cell towers, but
there's **no good reason to expect it to harm honey bees**]{.underline}

The next generation of cell phone connectivity --- the 5G network ---
has been launched. Most countries are projected to adopt the technology
by 2020, and we should expect download speeds ten to twenty times faster
than 4G as well as higher network capacity (i.e., more devices can be
used on a network simultaneously), feeding our existing data addictions.
For some people, the 5G launch has also renewed old concerns that cell
phone-generated electromagnetic waves could be interfering with honey
bee navigation.

It all started in 2006, when Dr. Jochen Kuhn, a professor at Landau
University, Germany, and his colleagues released the seminal study
(which, to the best of my knowledge, was never peer reviewed).1 The
researchers placed DECT docking stations --- digital enhanced cordless
telecommunications stations, the kind used for cordless landline
telephones --- inside two mini-hives and powered them up. The two other
hives did not get docking stations. They then trapped 25 bees at the
entrance of each hive, released them 800 meters away, and recorded how
many made their way home. They also measured comb areas in the hives,
after giving the mini-colonies a chance to build up. The bees from
docking-station-hives, as the old story goes, built less comb and were
worse at finding their way home. The next generation of cell phone
connectivity --- the 5G network --- has been launched. Most countries
are projected to adopt the technology by 2020, and we should expect
download speeds ten to twenty times faster than 4G as well as higher
network capacity (i.e., more devices can be used on a network
simultaneously), feeding our existing data addictions. For some people,
the 5G launch has also renewed old concerns that cell phone-generated
electromagnetic waves could be interfering with honey bee navigation.

[Data from two hives is obviously not enough to make any solid
conclusions]{.underline}, no matter how well an experiment is designed.
**[And well-designed, this wasn't]{.underline}**. The authors recognized
this, writing that "because of the explorative character of \[the\]
study we refrain from a differentiated statistical analysis." In other
words, [the data were too sparse to apply standard statistical tests
that all credible scientists use. And it didn't even involve cell
phones.]{.underline}

### 5G Bad\-\--Enegy\-\--2AC

**The transition period between 4G and 5G is not detrimental---overall,
[long term]{.underline} use of 5G [increases]{.underline} energy
[efficiency]{.underline}**

Kelly **Hill, 2022;** executive editor at RCR Wireless News, M.A. from
UC Berkley in Journalism; "Parsing the 5G Power Equation: Is 5G Actually
Greener?
https://www.rcrwireless.com/20220124/5g/parsing-the-5g-power-equation-is-5g-actually-greener

In comparison, [5G offers a far more **efficient** overall
structure]{.underline} in terms of its physical layer and need for such
reference signals, according to Dr. Nishith Tripathi, a wireless
researcher and adjunct associate professor of electrical and computer
engineering at Virginia Tech (formerly of Samsung Research America). "We
have taken care to make this a physical layer operation that is very
efficient, so [it will **consume less power** to get the information
that we want]{.underline}," he explains. "But it [takes time for
technology to stabilize,]{.underline} and \[move\] away from
NonStandalone, so [we **can reap the benefits of that 5G
capability**]{.underline}**."**

Fundamentally, [5G provides "much better **support for implementing
energy-saving features** in network products]{.underline}," according to
an Ericsson blog post from October 2021. "The crucial difference is the
[vastly improved support for **energy savings** during low-to-medium
traffic]{.underline}."

Power-saving mechanisms also [offer the possibility that instead of
steady-state power consumption, that at times of low usage, radio
channels could be shut down]{.underline}, explains Tripathi.

In [LTE]{.underline}, the number and timing of synchronization and
reference [signals provide very little space for time gaps, where
"micro-sleep" energy-saving features can operate**. 5G can allow gaps in
transmission**]{.underline} as long as 20 ms in SA and 160 ms in NSA
mode, which are 100 to 800 times longer than what is allowed in LTE,
along with [**requiring far less "always-on" signaling,** according to
Ericsson]{.underline}. "Since more components can be put in sleep mode
for longer periods, there is a [significant potential to **reduce energy
consumption of 5G-NR products** and eventually the overall network
energy consumption]{.underline}," Ericsson's experts write. However,
they also point out that [the network should be built with precision in
order to take advantage of power-saving features -- so that
high-capacity products are only put where that capacity is
needed]{.underline}.

In current 5G networks, [the **industry may be seeing a particularly
strong strain on power use** -- but that may change as the tech matures.
Early 5G implementations are limited in coverage,]{.underline} which can
drain device batteries faster as the device jumps back and forth between
LTE and 5G New Radio. In addition, 5G NonStandalone, the mode in which
most 5G networks operate today, still relies on LTE for control-plane
communications and adds more processing (and power) demand as a result.
As 5G SA becomes a larger part of the network, the numbers (on a
watt/bit basis) improve.

France's telecom regulator, Arcep, recently published its analysis of
energy assessment of 4G versus 5G, in the context of how each technology
would perform under traffic growth assumptions through 2028 in the 3.5
GHz band. What it found was that [**initially, 5G generated an
increas**e in energy consumption -- just how long that period was,
depended on the specific 5G rollout scenario being modeled]{.underline}.
But [generally]{.underline}, the study concluded, ["**energy efficiency
gains achieved from 5G deployment** will begin in 2023 and be clear by
2028 in the most densely populated areas."]{.underline}

[**Compared to 4G-only densification** strategy over the same time
period,]{.underline} Arcep said, [5G deployment enabled total energy
savings of up to ten times 2020 consumption levels by 2028]{.underline},
and was [associated with a corresponding decrease of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions]{.underline} of up to eight times 2020 GHG emissions.
However, the regulator added, "In less densely populated areas, however,
where traffic density is lower, virtually non-existent gains will not be
seen until 2025 at the earliest, and by 2028 at the latest."

So essentially, another "yes, but ..." [Yes, 5G will consume a great
deal of energy---but 4G would consume even more under the same
conditions. **Progress in energy savings, as in many things, is
incremental.**]{.underline}

"I believe that as time progresses, we will become more and more green
in terms of the 'G'," said Tripathi. "So 5G, greener than 4G; and 6G
will be greener than 5G. ... We are working on all those things to make
things a little bit greener compared to the previous generations. "Once
the idea is introduced in the standard, it takes some time before they
are implemented in real products," he notes. "So things take time. But
gradually, we are moving in that direction."

How can 5G help the environment?

[The speed, capacity and connectivity of 5G will provide many
opportunities to protect and preserve the environment. 5G]{.underline}
technology with IoT [will]{.underline} be able to [increase energy
efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable more use of
renewable energy. It can help reduce air and water pollution, minimize
water and food waste, and protect wildlife. It can]{.underline} also
[expand our understanding of and]{.underline} hence [improve
decision-making about weather, agriculture, pests, industry, waste
reduction and much more]{.underline}.

According to the UN, 68 percent of the world's population will live in
cities by 2050. [City governments and businesses are looking to
5G, [artificial intelligence
(AI) ](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/06/05/artificial-intelligence-climate-environment/)and
IoT technology to create smart cities where sensors, cameras and smart
phones will be linked]{.underline}; the connectivity and speed of these
networks will [enable cities to be better managed and more efficient and
sustainable.]{.underline}

Here are just some of the ways, 5G can benefit the environment.

Reducing energy consumption and emissions

[International standards have called for 5G to require much less energy
to run than 4G]{.underline}, which means [using less power while
transmitting more data]{.underline}. For example, one kilowatt-hour
(kWh) of electricity is needed to download 300 high-definition movies in
4G; with 5G, one kWh can download 5,000 ultra-high-definition movies.

5G [linked with IoT will also cut energy use, because devices will be
able to power up and shut down automatically when not
needed]{.underline}. Sensors in appliances, transportation networks,
buildings, factories, street lights, residences and more will monitor
and analyze their energy needs and consumption in real time and
automatically optimize energy use. For example, [smart electricity
meters installed in the Empire State Building have helped cut energy
costs by 38 percent]{.underline}. GE's Digital Power Plant for Steam in
France, equipped with 10,000 sensors to improve plant efficiency, got
the Guinness World Record for the world's most efficient power plant.

Because [saving energy also means cutting greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}, GE's Digital Power Plant software is expected to
reduce carbon emissions by 3 percent and fuel use by 67,000 tons of coal
per year. A study done by Ericcson, a leading information and
communication technology provider, projects that [IoT could cut carbon
emissions 15 percent by 2030]{.underline}.

[5G and the IoT will enable microgrids to be brought on line when the
main grid fails or is unavailable.]{.underline} This will make it
[possible to better integrate intermittent renewable energy sources such
as wind and solar into the grid.]{.underline} Ameresco, a
Massachusetts-based company, replaced an old steam plant with a fully
automated plant supported by 20,000 solar modules and its own microgrid
at the U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island, S.C. The system
reduced energy use by 75 percent.

[By enabling more people to work or access entertainment remotely and
avoid commuting and flying for business, 5G will save energy and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and airplanes.]{.underline}

If driving is a necessity, [5G can save time, fuel and vehicle emissions
by reducing traffic congestion and idling. With sensors and
cameras]{.underline}, 5G uses real time data to keep traffic flowing,
changing traffic lights to avoid delay. Carnegie Mellon's Metro21: Smart
Cities Institute's smart traffic control system, which employs radar and
cameras to reduce idling, has resulted in 20 percent fewer greenhouse
gas emissions in Pittsburgh[. 5G can also reduce the number of cars on
the road by helping drivers find parking spaces and enabling ride
sharing.]{.underline}

Reducing water and food waste

According to the EPA, [U.S. households waste one trillion gallons each
year due to leaks. Smart water sensors can detect leaks,]{.underline} as
well as water pollution and contamination.

[Sensors can also optimize agricultural water use.]{.underline} Arable,
an innovative agricultural company, uses smart agricultural sensors that
incorporate weather information and soil and crop conditions to [better
manage irrigation and make it more efficient]{.underline}. The [systems
also monitor plant stress, nutrients and pests]{.underline} to help plan
harvests.

The UN has estimated that about [one-third of the food produced globally
is wasted, which also wastes the energy and water that went into it.
Agricultural sensors can detect when a plant is wilting, so they can
help ensure that crops are harvested at the right time.]{.underline}
Other [sensors can detect food freshness and spoilage, so that consumers
know when food is safe to eat without depending on expiration
dates.]{.underline} [5G could eventually be used to tag all food where
it's produced, track harvest dates or identify specific animals, and
then trace the smart tags as food is transported to the
factory.]{.underline} Other sensor systems could monitor conditions in
the factory, assessing the food for quality and compliance with
regulations. An automated and transparent system could make sure that
the correct ingredients are delivered at the right time and packaged
properly. This would help reduce food waste, maximize food safety,
evaluate a food's sustainability, and allow a supply chain to respond
more quickly to supply and demand issues.

Protecting nature

To keep sewage from polluting the St. Joseph River in South Bend, Ind.,
smart sewer technology was installed in manholes. The technology reduced
sewage overflows by 70 percent ---over one billion gallons a year---and
saved the city more than \$500 million.

[Toxic blue-green algae bloom when water temperatures are
warm]{.underline}er than usual. [Nokia used 5G drones with cameras and
sensors over the Baltic Sea to detect blue-green algae growth in real
time.]{.underline} While algae are normally monitored by observation
from shore, the drones made it possible to detect algae blooms in more
remote areas. Getting timely information enables experts to rapidly take
actions to prevent such environmental hazards.

Australian start-up Myriota and the Australian Institute of Marine
Science (AIMS) are using [marine buoys with satellite-connected IoT
sensors to track ocean currents, sea surface water temperatures, and the
barometric pressure of the ocean in real time. This helps researchers
better monitor changing conditions in the ocean and understand how the
ocean behaves.]{.underline}

[Rainforest Connection]{.underline}, a nonprofit fighting illegal
deforestation[, is working with 5G and AI to protect the rainforest in
Costa Rica]{.underline}. AI recorders [recognize the sounds of chainsaws
and other machinery, so they can alert rangers about illegal logging in
real time.]{.underline} They can also distinguish the sounds of animals
under stress so that rangers can respond quickly to illegal poaching.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature uses [5G geolocation
technology to track the location and movements of endangered
animals]{.underline}. And at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda
Breeding in China, 5G is being used to monitor panda conditions and
encourage breeding. Pandas only ovulate once a year and are fertile for
only 24 to 36 hours so breeding them is challenging. The technology
identifies panda mating calls and plays them back to the pandas to
encourage them to mate with each other.

The report [examined 31 use cases for 5G across five industry
verticals]{.underline}: transportation and cities, manufacturing,
buildings and energy, agriculture, and working, living and health. The
report discusses the following three verticals in depth, [where **5G
will have significant downstream carbon abatement
potential**:\]{.underline}
 

**[Transportation and cities]{.underline}**: [5G-enabled use cases in
the ground transportation]{.underline} and cities vertical can total up
to 86.5 MMtCO2e of carbon abatement in the U.S., thanks to reduced
traffic congestion, [**reduced vehicle idling** at signals]{.underline}
and while parking, shorter routes optimization, and greater adoption and
opt-ins of more [**sustainable choices** such as public
transportation.]{.underline} The carbon abatement in this vertical is
[**equivalent to** the carbon sequestered by **106 million acres of U.S
forests** in a year.]{.underline}

**[Manufacturing]{.underline}**: [**5G-enabled use** cases in the
manufacturing vertical can total up to 67.4 MMtCO2e of carbon abatement
in the U.S]{.underline}., thanks to [**enhanced inventory
management**,]{.underline} real-time asset monitoring, predictive
maintenance, process augmentation, and travel avoidance. The carbon
abatement from inventory management by 2025 alone is equivalent to
removing CO2 emissions from 17 coal fired power-plants in a year.

[Energy and buildings]{.underline}: 5G-enabled use cases in the energy
and buildings vertical can total up to 67.9 MMtCO2e of carbon abatement
in the U.S., thanks to real-time monitoring[, **increased green energy
use**]{.underline}, fuel savings through reduced transport facilitated
by remote operations, [**building energy management systems**,
commercial HVAC controls]{.underline}, [smart meters and smart grids,
and **renewable microgrids**.]{.underline} The carbon abatement from
energy and buildings by 2025 is equivalent to [removing CO2 emissions
from electricity consumed by 12 million homes in a year.]{.underline}

"This study shows [5G networks can **bring material reductions** in our
country's carbon footprint,"]{.underline} said Peters Suh, Accenture's
North America Communications and Media industry lead. "The [crucial
piece will be how industries leverage cloud-first 5G
networks]{.underline} to [**bring greater innovation** into key
operational processes]{.underline}. With appropriate education and
ecosystem changes, organizations can reap the climate benefits of 5G
across their cloud continuum, which [includes everything from the public
cloud to the edge.\"]{.underline}\

"U.S. 5G networks already cover 305 million people, we're building out
5G faster than we built out 4G, and every day, the wireless industry is
working to make these networks go faster and farther," added Attwell
Baker. "Taken together, America's wireless ecosystem is positioning
U[.S. **innovators across these key industry verticals** to quickly

[5G and the spread of COVID-19]{.underline}

One **[myth about 5G]{.underline}**'s impact on health that has been
widely spread in 2020 is the fictional association between the roll-out
of 5G and the spread of COVID-19.25 Put plainly, the idea that 5G
transmits COVID-19 is as bogus as it is impossible[. COVID-19 is a virus
spread through respiratory droplets from other people. **A virus does
not travel via radio waves**.]{.underline}

A variant of [5G misinformation related to COVID-19]{.underline} is that
5G emits radiation that weakens people's immune systems, making them
more susceptible to illness.26 [This is]{.underline} similarly
[false]{.underline}.

It is likely that misinformation about 5G's relationship to COVID-19
will be as pervasive in 2021 as it was in 2020. An Ofcom
[survey]{.underline} at the end of June 2020 [found that 29% of
respondents had come across false or misleading information about
COVID-19]{.underline} in the prior week.27 The most common topic, seen
by 21% of respondents, was "theories linking the origins or causes of
COVID-19 to 5G technology." Misinformation about 5G was even more
prevalent earlier in the year: An Ofcom survey undertaken from April
10--12, 2020, found that 50% of respondents had seen false or misleading
statements about 5G. The good news is that these people recognized the
misinformation as such.28 The bad news is that the majority (57%) of
those who saw what they regarded as misinformation did nothing about it.

### 5G Bad\-\--AT: Disease\-\--1AR

**There are no [conclusive]{.underline} scientific studies that 5G
actually harms humans---exposure levels of 5G are actually
[lower]{.underline} than the current 4G system**

Joan **Conrow, 20;** Managing editor and communications consultant at
the Cornell Alliance for Science, journalist (specialty in technological
misinformation); "Three reasons why 5G is unlikely to cause harm"
06/26/2020
https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2020/06/three-reasons-why-5g-is-unlikely-to-cause-harm/

Following persistent conspiracy theories that have resulted in vandalism
of 5G towers and attacks on telecom workers, a team of [experts has once
again considered the health and safety issues around 5G high-speed
wireless communications networks]{.underline}.

So, what did they find? While it is obviously absurd to suggest that a
biological agent like a virus can be transmitted directly over the
electromagnetic spectrum, [are there any actual scientifically-justified
health concerns about 5G?]{.underline}

The new evidence-based review, which appears in Health Physics journal,
concludes that [there appears to be "**little or no risk of adverse
health effects**" related to radiofrequency (RF) exposure from 5G
systems]{.underline}. The paper was authored by a physician/biologist,
epidemiologist, engineers and physical scientists, all working
voluntarily and collaboratively on a consensus basis.

The authors explain that [**5G "is not specific to frequency**" and may
be deployed for operating networks currently using frequencies extending
from 100s to 1,000s of MHz.]{.underline} It can also operate in the 10s
of GHz where the wavelengths are 10 mm or less --- the so-called
millimeter wave (MMW) band.

[MMWs are not new, and are already found in such
applications]{.underline} as airport scanners, automotive collision
avoidance systems and perimeter surveillance radar security systems.
However, the rapid expansion of [5G highspeed wireless systems across
the globe "will produce a more ubiquitous presence of MMW in the
environment]{.underline}," the authors noted.

The review prompted the Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR) of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to issue this
statement:

"While we acknowledge gaps in the scientific literature, particularly
for exposures at millimeter-wave frequencies, \[we judge\] [the
**likelihood of yet unknown health hazards** at exposure levels within
current limits to **be very low, if they exist at all."**]{.underline}

COMAR's consensus [statement was issued to counter an **increase in
alarming claims** that people and wildlife are suffering strange and
**unusual health effects from 5G technology**]{.underline}**.**

"This **[misinformation]{.underline}** together with activist websites
expressing even more ominous consequences of 5G --- ranging from cancer
induction to being responsible for the current coronavirus pandemic ---
has [**created** substantial and **unnecessary** **public
anxiety**,"]{.underline} said Jerrold T. Bushberg of the University of
California, Davis School of Medicine and vice-chair of COMAR.

Here are the [three main reasons why **experts agree** that health
**harm** from 5G exposure appears **unlikely**:]{.underline}

In contrast to lower-frequency fields, [the MMW band **does not
penetrate** **beyond** the outer layer of the skin and so deeper
**tissues** are not exposed or heated.]{.underline} Tissue heating is
the primary potentially harmful effect of exposure to radiofrequency
(RF) fields.

The introduction of [**5G** is **unlikely** to **change** overall
**levels of RF exposure**.]{.underline} People will [continue to receive
the most RF exposure due to the "uplink" from their own cell
phones]{.underline} and other wireless devices --- as they do now ---
and not from transmission from base stations.

[RF exposures from cellular base stations, including 5G stations, will
remain small]{.underline} and well below current [**international**
exposure **standards** and guidelines **in nearly all
locations**]{.underline} accessible to the public.

"Exposures may be higher near base station antennas, but [wireless
carriers are still obligated legally to ensure that transmitting
facilities comply with regulatory limits]{.underline}," the authors
noted. "Issues related to compliance are quite possible in countries
that have adopted 'precautionary' limits that are considerably lower
than those in internationally accepted guidelines and standards."

However, [overall **exposure is expected to be lower with 5G** than with
4G base stations because 5G makes more **efficient use of transmitter
power** that can steer signals toward specific users]{.underline}.
"Since the 5G beam will exist only while communicating with a user, the
longterm time-averaged exposure levels will also be lower," the authors
wrote.

"\[S\]o long as exposures remain below established guidelines, the
research results to date do not support a determination that adverse
health effects are associated with RF exposures, including those from 5G
systems," according to the COMAR statement.

The experts did acknowledge limitations in the current body of evidence
on possible health and safety effects of 5G exposure and identified key
areas for further research, including high-quality studies of the
biological effects of MMW.

"So far, no comprehensive surveys of environmental 5G signals have been
conducted; few 5G networks are presently in operation, and those are
largely demonstration projects transmitting at less than full capacity,"
the authors wrote. "Nevertheless, [the designs of 5G networks are
constrained by the same requirements]{.underline} that apply to previous
generations of cellular systems: to provide a signal that is strong
enough to be useful within a given cell but not so strong as to cause
interference to users in nearby cells. Consequently, on this basis
alone, [one can expect that **exposures** from 5G networks will **not
differ greatly** from those associated with present generation
networks]{.underline}."

**The radiation emitted by 5G systems is not harmful to the human DNA**

States National Cancer Program and is part of the National Institutes of
Health, which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S.

03/10/2022
https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet

Why has there been [concern that cell phones may cause
cancer]{.underline}?

There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or
mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer
or other health problems: Cell phones [emit radiation]{.underline} (in
the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone
use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones
would be of concern given how many people use them.

Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern
because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because
[ionizing radiation]{.underline}---a higher energy form of radiation
than what cell phones emit---has been found to cause some brain cancers.
[Many different kinds of studies have been carried out]{.underline} to
try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health.

However, [the **evidence** to date suggests that cell phone use **does
not cause** brain or other kinds of **cancer** in humans.]{.underline}

Is the radiation from cell phones harmful?

[Cell phones emit radiation]{.underline} in the radiofrequency region of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Second-, third-, and fourth-generation
cell phones (2G, 3G, 4G) emit radiofrequency in the frequency range of
0[.7--2.7 GHz]{.underline}. Fifth-generation [(5G)]{.underline} cell
phones are [anticipated]{.underline} to use the frequency spectrum [up
to 80 GHz.]{.underline}

These frequencies **[all fall in the nonionizing range of the
spectrum]{.underline},** which is low frequency and low energy. [The
energy is too low to damage DNA]{.underline}. By contrast, ionizing
radiation, which includes [x-rays, radon, and cosmic rays, is high
frequency and high energy.]{.underline} Energy from ionizing radiation
can damage DNA. DNA damage can cause changes to genes that [may increase
the risk of cancer.]{.underline}

The NCI fact sheet Electromagnetic Fields and Cancer lists sources of
radiofrequency radiation. More information about ionizing radiation can
be found on the Radiation page.

[The human body does absorb energy from devices that emit radiofrequency
radiation]{.underline}. The **[only]{.underline}** consistently
**[recognized biological effect]{.underline}** of radiofrequency
radiation absorption in humans that the general public might encounter
[is heating to the area of the body where a cell phone is
held]{.underline} (e.g., the ear and head). However, that heating is
[**not sufficient** to measurably increase core body
temperature]{.underline}. There are [no other clearly established
dangerous health effects on the human body from radiofrequency
radiation.]{.underline}

[**Has** the incidence of brain and central nervous system **cancers**
changed during the time cell phone use **increased**]{.underline}?

**[No]{.underline}**. Investigators have studied whether the incidence
of brain or other central nervous system cancers (that is, the number of
new cases of these cancers diagnosed each year) has changed during the
time that cell phone use increased dramatically.

These [**studies found**:]{.underline}

- **[stable incidence rates]{.underline}** for adult gliomas in the
  United States (1), Nordic countries (2) and Australia (3) [during the
  past several decades]{.underline}

- stable incidence rates for pediatric brain tumors in the United States
  during 1993--2013 (4)

- stable incidence rates for acoustic neuroma (5), which are
  nonmalignant tumors, and meningioma (6), which are usually
  nonmalignant, [among US adults since 2009]{.underline}

In addition, [**studies** using cancer incidence data have tested
different scenarios]{.underline} (simulations) determining whether the
incidence trends are in line with various levels of risk as reported in
studies of cell phone use and brain tumors between 1979 and 2008 (7, 8).
These simulations s[howed that many risk changes reported in
case-control studies were not consistent with incidence data**, implying
that biases and errors in the study** may have distorted the
findings.]{.underline}

Because these studies examine cancer incidence trends over time in
populations rather than comparing risk in people who do and don't use
cell phones, [their ability to observe potential small differences in
risk among heavy users or susceptible populations is
limited.]{.underline} Observational/epidemiologic studies---including
case--control and cohort studies (described below)---are designed to
measure individual exposure to cell phone radiation and ascertain
specific health outcomes.

### 5G Bad\-\--AT: Radiation\-\--2AC

#### 5G is fine\-\--radiation isn't radioactivity.

Research for the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT)

What has led to this [high level of concern about 5G's health
impacts]{.underline}? It may have its [roots in a simple **confusion of
terminology**]{.underline}.

[Radiation is commonly assumed to involve radioactivity,]{.underline}
but [this is not]{.underline} necessarily [the case]{.underline}. The
confusion arises because [the words **"radiation"** and
**"radioactivity**" **have been conflated**]{.underline}, a confusion
that has persisted [since]{.underline} the dropping of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki nuclear bombs in [1945]{.underline}. As a result of these
events, as well as incidents at several nuclear power plants in the 75
years since, the term "radiation" has often mistakenly become associated
with destruction on a massive scale. In a similar vein, "radiation"---in
reality, radioactivity---is also associated with cancer, reinforcing the
word's connotation of mortal peril.

The point here is that [radiation is not inherently
radioactive.]{.underline} The literal definition of radiation is merely
any process by which an object (from a human to a radiator to a star)
emits energy (whether heat, light, or radioactive particles), which then
travels through a medium (such as the air or hot water) and is absorbed
by another object (a human body, a frying pan, a steam engine, or
anything else). Radiation thus spans multiple everyday processes to
which most people do not give a moment's consideration. In our daily
lives, most of us are regularly exposed to multiple types of radiation,
most commonly in the form of sunlight.

By this definition, [**5G does generate radiation**, but at very safe
levels, and **none of it is radioactive radiation**]{.underline}. 5G
base stations and phones, and the frequency ranges within which 5G
operates, are very likely to be operating well within safe parameters in
2021 and throughout 5G's lifetime, which may extend to two decades.
[Radiation within these parameters **does not**]{.underline}
significantly **[raise the risk of cancer]{.underline}**. [It also does
not **weaken the immune system**, and thus has not contributed to the
spread of COVID-19.]{.underline}

guest lecturer at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central
Intelligence Agency, and the National Defense University at Fort McNair;
Washington Times, "China\'s military buildup, global ambitions on
collision course with U.S., Pentagon official warns,"
<https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/20/chad-sbragia-warns-xi-jinping-china-military-build/>\]

[China's decades long **military buildup** now poses a **threat** to
U.S. security not just in Asia but also **around the
globe**]{.underline}, [and a **confrontation** with China could emerge
at one of several **flashpoints**]{.underline}, a senior Pentagon
official warned Thursday.

Chad Sbragia, deputy assistant defense secretary for China, told a
congressional commission that [Beijing's buildup of **missiles**,
**warships**, **aircraft**, **space weaponry** and
**cybercapabilities**]{.underline} [has accelerated under President
Xi]{.underline} Jinping. He described it as "one of the most ambitious
military modernization efforts in recent history."

["In most of the potential flashpoints]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific
region --- [the **Taiwan** Strait, the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea, the
Senkaku Islands or the **Korea**n Peninsula]{.underline} --- [the
**U**nited **S**tates may find itself in a **military crisis** with
China]{.underline}," Mr. Sbragia told a hearing of the congressionally
created United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission. He
said the challenge posed by Chinese military and economic expansion
requires a Cold War-type response.

[While not a replica of]{.underline} the standoff with [the Soviet Union
in the Cold War, the China threat is "equally as
consequential]{.underline} and therefore merits the same concentration
of effort as put forth in the past," he said.

[China's military]{.underline} now [boasts 2 million
personnel]{.underline} in uniform. [The Chinese navy]{.underline}, after
decades of building large numbers of warships, [is now the
world's]{.underline} **[largest]{.underline}** [in terms of total
assets]{.underline}, he said.

["China's **military** is fielding an increasingly formidable array of
**ballistic** and]{.underline} **[cruise]{.underline}** [missiles,
modern fighter aircraft, autonomous systems, and a suite of **cyber**
and **space capabilities**, postured to **deny** the U.S. **military
access**]{.underline} to the Indo-Pacific theater if called upon," Mr.
Sbragia said.

[Military **power projection** efforts are also linked to China's
**expanding economic might** through such programs as]{.underline} Mr.
[Xi's **B**elt and **R**oad **I**nitiative and military-civilian fusion.
China's single overseas military base]{.underline} in Djibouti, on the
Horn of Africa, [is just the beginning of a]{.underline} **[global
basing structure]{.underline}** [to match the U.S.
military's]{.underline} reach, U.S. officials say.

"In other words, [it is not a matter of **whether** the]{.underline}
\[**[P]{.underline}**eople's **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy\] [intends to establish another military
base]{.underline} overseas, [but **when** and **how**]{.underline} they
plan to do it," Mr. Sbragia said.

"[The implications]{.underline} of China's military modernization [are
profound. This is a long-term challenge]{.underline} that will require
sustained funding and strategic planning to address ...," Mr. Sbragia
said. "[There is no zero-cost solution to global competition with
China]{.underline}."

Global ambitions

The Capitol Hill hearing also included witnesses who revealed how
[Chinese military power is expanding globally and could help **spread**
the ruling Communist Party's **authoritarian model**]{.underline}. Isaac
B. Kardon, a professor at the Naval War College, said [the PLA navy
could use a network of Chinese commercial ports for logistics in
projecting military power. Chinese companies]{.underline}, he noted,
[own or operate 94 ports around the world]{.underline}, including the
ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

"[The \[Chinese navy\] depends on **commercial ports**]{.underline} [to
support its **growing operations**]{.underline} [overseas]{.underline},"
he said.

Mr. Kardon cited an unidentified PLA officer who was quoted as saying of
the Pakistani port of Gwadar that "the food is already on the plate.
We'll eat it whenever we want to."

[Beijing also has set as a goal the]{.underline} [**reunification of
Taiwan** with the mainland by 2049]{.underline}, the 100th anniversary
of the rise to power of Mao Zedong's communists.

[By 2035, China plans to deploy a high-technology force with
**modernized weapons**]{.underline} [and command and control systems to
be able to follow]{.underline} Mr. [Xi's guidance to "fight and win
wars."]{.underline}

Mr. Sbragia said [China outlined its goals in a]{.underline} 2019
military [white paper that called for the **P**]{.underline}eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy [to "safeguard
China's **overseas interests**" by]{.underline} such means as [building
"offshore forces" and **overseas bases**]{.underline}. Chinese military
strategists justify the expansion by saying the PLA will be "fulfilling
international obligations" to secure the global commons and that Beijing
will "never threaten any other country or seek any sphere of influence."

[In the]{.underline} **[Arctic]{.underline}**, [China is deploying
civilian research organizations that could be used for a]{.underline}
**[military presence]{.underline}**.

**[Taiwan]{.underline}** [and the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea are
**prime flashpoints**]{.underline} [for a direct
U.S.-clash]{.underline}, Mr. Sbragia said. He was reiterating U.S.
complaints that [Beijing has "increasingly employed **coercive** tactics
and measures in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea to deny claimants the
legitimate regulation, exploitation and use of maritime natural
resources]{.underline} in their exclusive economic zones."

The Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy concluded that [China is
seeking **regional hegemony** in the Indo-Pacific and "**displacement**
of the **U**nited **S**tates to achieve global preeminence in the
future]{.underline}."

Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said repeatedly that a rising China is
his department's top security challenge.

A break with the past

The Pentagon testimony breaks with previous intelligence assessments
that China's military ambitions were limited to retaking Taiwan.

The Pentagon's 2003 annual report to Congress on the Chinese military
concluded that "preparing for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait
is the primary driver for China's military modernization." Subsequent
annual surveys emphasized that the buildup was limited to Taiwan but
noted that China's military was also interested in taking part in
international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.

Few of the reports suggested that China had global ambitions to achieve
military dominance, as conservative military analysts have argued for
years.

Spokesmen for the National Intelligence Council and Defense Intelligence
Agency had no immediate comments on the shifting arguments.

Retired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence
director, said Mr. Sbragia's testimony was encouraging.

["Even as short as five years ago, the U.S. intelligence community's
**conventional wisdom** held that the PRC's leaders were primarily
focused on '**domestic concerns**' of **regime survival** or enacting
**military modernization** for regional purposes]{.underline} in order
to resolve territorial disputes within the 'first island chain,'" said
Capt. Fanell, referring to the island stretching north to south close to
China's east coast.

"Despite this all-to-common failure to recognize the PRC's strategic
intentions, the fact is the PRC has and continues to build a naval force
that if left unchallenged will not only be sailing the seven seas, as it
is today, but will increasingly be able to achieve sea control in the
global maritime commons as early as 2030, and potentially even sea
superiority by 2049," he said.

Capt. Fanell said [the institutional bias to
**underestimate**]{.underline} [China's strategic intentions and PLA
modernization and global operations should lead to updates]{.underline}
of the language of the 2018 national defense statement, [deeming China a
**strategic adversary** or **enemy** rather than a strategic
competitor.]{.underline}

Rick Fisher, a China military analyst, said a small community of
skeptics and conservatives can claim vindication with Mr. Sbragia's
testimony, which echoes what they have been saying for over two decades:
that an unconstrained China will become a global threat to America.

"Conservatives have also long warned that [China's ambitions go well
beyond simply taking over Taiwan]{.underline}," Mr. Fisher said. "[What
China will try to do to Taiwan is]{.underline} simply [the
**template**]{.underline} [for how it will eventually]{.underline}
**[threaten every other democracy]{.underline}**."

Indeed, [the United States' **leadership in science** and **technology**

"**soft power**." It **buttresses** the country's **economic

innovation, and]{.underline} the [capacity to develop]{.underline} ideas
into deployable [weapons, systems, and concepts, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates has [arrived at its modern-day military advantage
and superiority]{.underline}.\[iv\]

To that end, [science and technology may be considered **key elements**
of the United States' comprehensive national power -- **fundamentals**
of the country's **strength** vis-à-vis **competitors**. Yet science and
technology **alone cannot ensure**]{.underline} any country's continued
**[security]{.underline}**, prosperity, or hegemony; far from operating
in a vacuum, [science and technology are **constantly evolving** to

**threats**. To reap advantage]{.underline} from science and technology,
especially in their national security application, [a country **must
continually innovate** to tackle]{.underline} contemporary [developments
and **anticipate** future ones]{.underline}. This poses a considerable
challenge, the solution to which extends beyond advanced engineering and
research.

To explore these notions, this essay, particularly interested in the
application of science and technology toward national security ends,
examines the United States' recent employment of security-related
technologies. From this, it explores the attributes of science and
technology power and the similarities and differences between science
and technology power and other forms of national power such as the
economic and diplomatic. Looking at the relative importance of science
and technology in the United States today and likely significance in the
coming future, it lays out a series of policy recommendations that may
guide policymakers as they make decisions that impact the direction of
the country's scientific and technological course.

Employment of -- and Challenges Facing -- National Security-Related
Technology

Recognizing the vital role that technology played in winning World War
Two, along with the emerging threat of Soviet technological
competitiveness[, the United States established]{.underline} in the
war's wake [an **extensive infrastructure** to support national security
science and technology efforts. This provided]{.underline} foundation
and [**catalyst** for]{.underline} the [development of **military
capabilities**]{.underline} and tools [needed to **meet the challenges**
of]{.underline} the Cold War and [the **modern day**: the **nuclear
triad**, **intelligence-gathering** and **cyber infrastructure**,
**space-based radar** and **communications systems**, **advanced
precision-guided munitions**, and **integrated command** and
**control**, along with **myriad other assets**]{.underline}.\[v\]

[These technologies have seen **extensive use** in contemporary military
conflicts]{.underline}. The wars in the Balkans and the Gulf saw the
ever-increasing use of position, navigation, and timing assets such as
GPS to provide precise and reliable information to the warfighter and
direct precision-guided weaponry.\[vi\] Targeted airstrikes and weapons
such as the long-range cruise missile have allowed for far more rapid,
responsive, and accurate strikes than those of the past while
substantially reducing collateral damage. Combat drones and unmanned
aerial vehicles, innovations emblematic of the "War on Terror," enable
the warfighter to engage adversaries and conduct reconnaissance while
safely remaining away from the front lines of the battlefield. Stealth
aircraft, using a range of advanced technologies that reduce reflections
and emissions, have helped pilots conduct sorties while evading
detection.\[vii\]

[Technology abets the United States' security **beyond warfighting**.
**Advanced cyber capabilities**]{.underline} -- encryption, for example
-- [seek to **defend the networks** which control the country's power,
transit, and water infrastructure from]{.underline} malicious
[hacks]{.underline} and crippling denial of service.\[viii\]
[Technologies capable of **detecting harmful biological** and **chemical
agents** guard the country against **potentially devastating attack** by
non-state actors]{.underline}.\[ix\] [Increasingly sophisticated
monitoring and surveillance technology enables the government to
**globally track** and **work** to counter criminal activity, terrorist
organizations, and other developments]{.underline} which threaten the
country's safety.\[x\]

Crucially, though, the United States' contemporary application of
national security systems has also demonstrated the inherent challenges
of innovation and the limitations of technology. Despite advanced
military hardware, principally designed to fight large-scale
conventional wars against Cold War-era foes, the United States military
had to "catch up" and react to unconventional tactics, such as roadside
bombs and sniper attacks, employed against it in the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars. Though decidedly outnumbered and outgunned, enemy
combatants effectively countered the United States' asymmetric
technological advantage through guerilla warfare, propaganda, and
exploiting collateral damage that advanced weapons systems created --
doctrines which the United States' technology did not anticipate and was
unprepared or unsuited to counter.\[xi\] Likewise, despite the
sophistication of the United States' homeland security technologies, the
government has struggled to prevent incidents of domestic terrorism such
as mass shootings, often characterized by the use of simple,
off-the-shelf equipment.\[xii\]

Meanwhile, in reaction to the United States' present-day technological
superiority, competitive foreign powers such as Russia and China are
heavily investing in hardware and capabilities in the cyber and military
realms specifically designed to counter the United States' technological
strengths and exploit its demonstrated vulnerabilities. The
technological capabilities underlying the United States' comparative
military advantage are now proliferating to an increasing number of
state and non-state actors, including potential adversaries, leveling
the military "playing field."\[xiii\]

The Attributes of National Security Science and Technology Power

From this, several key attributes and characteristics of science and
technology as a form of national power can be identified. Foremost is
the capacity for technology and science to be a significant,
occasionally decisive, enhancer of a country's military strength against
enemies. Countries which develop innovative military technologies which
effectively counter an adversary's offenses or defensives, or against
which an adversary has no means to protect itself, find themselves
disproportionately advantaged on the battlefield. Indeed, technologies
which upend dominant "status quo" warfighting paradigms -- such as,
historically, the introduction of the chariot, the tank, or nuclear
weapons -- are poised to significantly disrupt and reorder the
geopolitical and military balance of power.\[xiv\]

To that end, science and technology power, particularly in the national
security sphere, is developed and sustained through the adaption to, and
more so through the anticipation of, revolutionary changes in military
affairs, doctrine, and hardware. As Lieutenant Colonel Scott Stephenson
noted in the influential "The Revolution in Military Affairs," "those
slow to adapt to military revolutions... are likely to suffer painful
results. When the pace of change accelerates, the militaries that
anticipate and adapt are likely to gain a massive advantage over
potential enemies who are less agile."\[xv\] That agility is, in large
part, borne from innovations in science and the development of new
technologies which lead to unanticipated, and therefore difficult to
counter, doctrines.

A defining characteristic of science and technology power, then, is the
continual quest for states to match, counter, and out-compete the
technology of their adversaries. This continuing interplay between
technology and national power, characterized by the sustained
technological evolution and described often as an "offset," has been a
key focus for national security-related research and development
throughout the Cold War and into the present. The United States'
deployment of nuclear weapons, for example, offset the numerical
advantage held by the Soviet Union's land forces in the early Cold War.
Soviet parity in nuclear weapons catalyzed the development of guided
weapon and integrated command and control as a counter, focusing on
accuracy of targeted weapons systems independent of range.\[xvi\] The
United States' capacity to offset Soviet technology through innovative
developments -- and the Soviet bankruptcy borne from military
expenditure that came as a corollary -- was an important factor in
maintaining a generally peaceful stable of power along with the
country's ultimate triumph in the Cold War. In the present-day, China
and Russia's focus on countering the systems and technologies which
currently provide the United States' military asymmetry is emblematic of
this "offset" approach to science and technology power.

Paradoxically, however, national security-related technology in the
present day has become as great an equalizer as it has historically been
a separator of actors' strengths. Technological superiority in the
present may provide the United States' unrivaled military strength,
especially against foes (historically, state actors with large
conventional forces) for which its national security technologies
anticipated countering. Yet as the example of the Iraq and Afghani
insurgencies amply demonstrated, technological superiority coupled with
innovation focused on addressing hypothetical future battlefields may
not be adequate to oppose or defeat all actors or all forms of warfare,
regardless of the level of their sophistication.

Indeed, advanced technologies may be entirely vulnerable to actors
utilizing doctrines with simple technologies that nonetheless exploit
their weaknesses, as was the case with sophisticated -- and expensive --
American vehicles being destroyed by crude, homemade IEDs. Technology
itself also creates weaknesses; the United States' progressing economic
and social reliance upon interconnected networks, for example, makes the
country more vulnerable to potentially crippling attack. Despite
advanced American cybersecurity technologies and techniques, non-state
actors have still proven themselves capable of infiltrating, attacking,
and even denying use of American cyber capabilities; considering recent
trends, this vulnerable seems likely to continue, if not worsen.\[xvii\]

It may be that an attribute of science and technology power, borne more
from the focus and perceptions of the technologists, theorists, and
military leadership that employ it than from science and technology
itself, is that it obscures other factors which equally dictate
important developments in military, international, and geopolitical
affairs. Political upheaval, social change, and economic development can
change warfare dramatically, for example -- and have nothing to do with
"offset" strategies or war-room predictions of possible enemies' future
high-tech military hardware. As a product of the military-industrial
complex that emerged in the Cold War United States to sustain continued
technological development, Americans tend to be acutely -- perhaps
overly -- sensitive to technological innovation among competitors and
potential rivals. Fears during the Cold War and contemporary discussions
of the "Third Offset" paint pictures of emerging, potential, and
fanciful enemy weapon systems -- which military planning and technology
development was and is oriented toward countering.\[xviii\] This
fixation on solutions entailing engineering and technological complexity
blinds the national security technology apparatus to external trends
that could definitively impact the future course of war -- such as the
collapse of the Soviet Union leaving the United States with a high-tech
military and warfighting doctrine unsuited for the military pressures
and asymmetric nature of counterinsurgency; the rise of radical
terrorism with ideological underpinnings that condone unconventional
guerilla tactics such as suicide bombings, which had great effect
against high-tech targets; or the continuing crisis where lone-wolf
gunmen using off-the-shelf rifles can commit massacres despite the
government's highly complex and pervasive surveillance and monitoring
technology.

Similarities and Differences to Other Forms of National Power

With these attributes in mind, a comparison can be drawn between science
and technology power and other forms of power which constitute a
country's comprehensive strength, such as the economic and diplomatic.
Regarding the economic, science and technology power is similar in that
[the development of science and technology is driven by the **same
forces as economic growth**]{.underline}. Like new economic products,
services, and methods of operation, [science and technology power relies
upon the **ingenuity of human actors** predicting and anticipating
future trends, possibilities, and human behavior.
**Innovation**]{.underline}, iteration, [and **competitiveness** are
**fundamental catalysts** for the continued evolution and growth of
both. The **rapid proliferation** and **subsequent use** of innovative
technologies across the world **quickly equalizes** both the national
security advantage and the economic advantage they provided their
inventor.]{.underline}

[Economic power, like national security technology, is a **key element**
of a country's warfighting capability]{.underline} -- [industrial might,
strength in quality production, and capable infrastructure are **crucial
facets** of a country's ability to **mobilize** and **project
force**]{.underline}. [A **fundamental difference**]{.underline} between
economic power and science and technology power, however[, is
**competition**]{.underline}. While economies naturally compete, there
is incentive for states to specialize in the economic product or service
most suited for it -- their comparative advantage. Competing economies
are not actively incentivized to counter the economic specialization of
their rivals. [With science and technology power for national security
use]{.underline}, however, [states **decidedly hope** to **actively**
and **explicitly counter** the relative advantage of their
adversaries]{.underline}.

Like diplomatic power, [science and technology has a "**soft power**"
element; other states and their societies may be **influenced** or
**compelled to action** by the **might**, **prestige**, or **cultural**
and **technological hegemony** of a country in possession of **highly
advanced** and **capable technologies**]{.underline}.\[xix\] Diplomatic
power occasionally experiences the same issue of science and technology
policy in being blinded to unpredicted or external trends in the social,
cultural, and economic spheres. The power of diplomacy, for example, did
not anticipate and struggled to deal with the cultural, social, and
political circumstances that led to a breakdown of order in
post-invasion Iraq; just as national security technology was unprepared
for the guerilla warfare of the Iraqi insurgency. Diplomatic power and
science and technology power differ, though, in the fields of innovation
and evolution. Whereas the military regime is constantly evolving and
occasionally being upended by revolutions in security technology and
associated doctrine, the Westphalian diplomatic order has remained
largely similar through centuries -- even as it has grown gradually more
complex and interconnected. States do not tend seek to outcompete each
other in the diplomatic sphere through revolutionary new approaches to
diplomacy; negotiations, sanctions, deals, bi- and multilateral
agreements, and the like have remained consistent "doctrines" employed
by states in their dealings with international friends and foes.

Science and Technology Power's Present and Future Importance

To return to Vannevar Bush's assertion over half a century ago, science
and technology is crucially important for a states' economic growth and
prosperity, the wellbeing of its citizens, and national security. This
remains absolutely the case today. [Despite the challenges facing
innovation in the face of unanticipated adversaries and the
proliferation of advanced, equalizing technologies among adversarial
states and non-state actors, science and technology provides the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [**unrivaled levels of
security** and **military hegemony**.]{.underline}

[With the appearance of **significant global challenges** -- **refugee
crises**, **environmental degradation**, the possible emergence of a
**bi- or multi-polar world** characterized by states with **rough** or
**equal technological parity**]{.underline}, to name a few -- [the
**future importance** of science and technology power **cutting across
all aspects** of national security will **undoubtedly
redouble**]{.underline}. Science and technology and its application as
an element of the United States' national power will need to be directed
to address these challenges. While the exact characteristics that will
define domestic and foreign national security technologies of the future
-- not to mention the economic and social -- remain uncertain, [the
United States **cannot afford to permit** its current **technological
advantage** to **slip**]{.underline}. Indeed, [as]{.underline} revision
[states such as **China** continue to develop their technologies to
**directly counter**]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [**capabilities**, it will]{.underline} likely
[become an **imperative** for the country to **more actively engage** in
and **support** the development of innovative new security technologies
and doctrines -- lest]{.underline}, as history would suggest, [the
**international order again be upended**]{.underline}.

System,"

[The system must]{.underline} also [be adapted to deal with]{.underline}
new issues that were not envisioned when the existing order was
designed. Foremost among these issues is [emerging and disruptive
technology, including **AI**, **additive manufacturing**]{.underline}
(or **[3D printing]{.underline}**), [quantum computing]{.underline},
[**genetic engineering**, **robotics**, **directed energy**,
the]{.underline} Internet of things ([**IOT**), **5G**, **space**,
**cyber**]{.underline}, and many others. Like other disruptive
technologies before them, [these innovations promise great benefits, but
also carry **serious downside risks**]{.underline}. For example, AI is
already resulting in massive efficiencies and cost savings in the
private sector. Routine tasks and other more complicated jobs, such as
radiology, are already being automated. In the future, autonomous
weapons systems may go to war against each other as human soldiers
remain out of harm's way.

Yet, [AI is]{.underline} also transforming economies and societies, and
[generating new security challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead
to widespread unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars,
for example, will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul
truck drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, some fear that [autonomous
weapons]{.underline} systems will become "killer robots" that select and
engage targets without human input, and [could eventually **turn on
their creators, resulting in human extinction**. The other technologies
on this lisgt similarly balance great potential upside with great
downside risk. 3D printing]{.underline}, for example, can be used to
"make anything anywhere," reducing costs for a wide range of
manufactured goods and encouraging a return of local manufacturing
industries.61 At the same time, advanced 3D printers [can]{.underline}
also [be used by revisionist and rogue states to print component parts
for advanced weapons systems or]{.underline} even [WMD]{.underline}
programs, **[spurring arms races and weapons
proliferation]{.underline}**.62 [Genetic engineering can]{.underline}
wipe out entire classes of disease through improved medicine, or [wipe
out entire classes of people through genetically engineered superbugs.
Directed-energy missile defenses may defend against incoming missile
attacks, while]{.underline} also **[undermining global strategic
stability]{.underline}**.

Perhaps [the greatest risk to global strategic stability from new
technology]{.underline}, however, [comes from the risk]{.underline} that
**[revisionist autocracies may win the new tech arms
race]{.underline}**. Throughout history, states that have dominated the
commanding heights of technological progress have also dominated
international relations. The United States has been the world's
innovation leader from Edison's light bulb to nuclear weapons and the
Internet. Accordingly, [stability has been maintained in Europe and
Asia]{.underline} for decades [because the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its democratic allies possessed a
favorable economic and military balance of power]{.underline} in those
key regions. Many believe, however, that China may now have the lead
[in]{.underline} the new technologies of the twenty-first century,
including [AI, quantum, 5G, **hypersonic missiles**, and others. If
China succeeds in mastering the technologies of the future before the
democratic core]{.underline}, then [this could lead to a drastic and
rapid shift in the balance of power, upsetting global strategic
stability, and the call for a democratic- led, **rules-based
system**]{.underline} outlined in these pages.63

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its
democratic allies need to work with other major powers to develop a
framework for **harness**ing emerging **tech**nology in a way that
**maximizes**]{.underline} its [**upside potential**, while
**mitigating**]{.underline} against its **[downside
risks]{.underline}**, and also [contributing to the maintenance of
global stability]{.underline}. The existing international order contains
a wide range of agreements for harnessing the technologies of the
twentieth century, but they need to be updated for the twenty-first
century. The world needs an entire new set of arms-control,
nonproliferation, export-control, and other agreements to exploit new
technology while mitigating downside risk. These agreements should seek
to maintain global strategic stability among the major powers, and
prevent the proliferation of dangerous weapons systems to hostile and
revisionist states.

[China's **digital authoritarian model** is ambitious. The CCP's
**commitment** to **technological dominance** is manifest in its
long-term **investment strategy**]{.underline}. Artificial intelligence
([AI]{.underline}) [is a **focal point** because it enables
**innovation** and **supremacy** in]{.underline} so [many other
fields]{.underline}. In 2019, [China made clear its desire to be the
**world's leading AI superpower** by 2030]{.underline},4 [with a **rough
plan** to have caught up with the **U**nited **S**tates by 2020, to
**surpass** the **U**nited **S**tates by **2025**, and to **dominate
globally** in AI industries by **2030**]{.underline}.5 [The immensity of
the regime's investment in other **emerging technologies** is
**staggering**, with no less than 16 different "Manhattan Project"-scale
initiatives in]{.underline} fields as varied as [**quantum computing**,
**cryptography**, **5G**, **facial recognition**, and
**genomics**]{.underline}.6

[China has experimented with]{.underline} and deployed ground-breaking
[**repressive digital technology**, most notably against]{.underline}
the **[Uighur minority]{.underline}** in Xinjiang. [An **unprecedented**
system of **mass surveillance** monitors the movement of
people]{.underline}, phones, and vehicles to detect behavior that merits
investigation or detention. [This techno-totalitarian system is being
**extended** to other parts of China as well as **exported** across the
world]{.underline}.

Countries as varied as Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, and the
United Arab Emirates have bought Chinese surveillance technology.7 Many
others have received training in topics like proactive censorship, or
"public opinion guidance." [China]{.underline} also [exports digital
information infrastructure, such as]{.underline} Huawei's
**[5G]{.underline}** telecommunications systems, [under the guise of
the]{.underline} Belt and Road Initiative (**[BRI]{.underline}**).
[These deals create **long-term leverage**. Even nominally private
Chinese companies are **obligated by law** to provide **unquestioning**,
**immediate**, and **confidential support**]{.underline} to the
country's intelligence and security agencies. As U.S. Sen. Mark Warner
(D-VA) noted, "any supposedly safe Chinese product is one firmware
update away from being an insecure Chinese product."8

On the diplomatic front, [China has made huge efforts to **dominate
multilateral bodies** and agendas in pursuit of regulatory and
**normative dominance**]{.underline}.9 [Chinese nationals]{.underline}
now [lead four of the 16 U.N. agencies, including]{.underline} the
International Telecommunications Union (**[ITU]{.underline}**), the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(**[UNIDO]{.underline}**), the International Civil Aviation Organization
(**[ICAO]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline} the Food and Agriculture
Organization (**[FAO]{.underline}**). In its latest push to coopt
multilateral institutions, China has led an effort, together with Russia
and Saudi Arabia, to place a more pliant head of the U.N. Human Rights
Council (UNHRC) and undermine the consensus candidate favored by
democracies.10

[China recognized]{.underline} very early that [it could have
**significant influence** if it sought out **leadership roles** at tech
standard-setting bodies. It adopted an **aggressive strategy** to push
for **first-mover advantage** for its protocols that can provide a
**powerful edge** to its businesses and sway the **global tech
community** to **adopt its protocols** for emerging
technologies]{.underline}.11 Furthermore, China recently secured a
commitment from 14 other countries in the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement not to challenge its Great
Firewall and other digital restrictions. The RCEP is the largest trade
pact in world. It cements China's central role in global supply chains,
particularly in high tech. By flexing its economic muscles to gain
international political influence, China is winning the global narrative
battle about cyber sovereignty and the advantages of its
techno-authoritarian model of governance over the U.S.-led democratic
one. This brings not only political benefits but significant long-term
advantages to Chinese tech firms.

[China has even succeeded in normative realms like the
UN]{.underline}HRC, [where a Chinese representative gained a seat on the
influential Consultative Group, which oversees the selection of
candidates for U.N. human rights expert roles]{.underline}.12 As the
United States has withdrawn from the UNHRC and the EU has been
preoccupied with its own problems, [China was able to **convince** the
**majority of delegations** at the council to **support declarations**
that its use of **technology** in both **Xinjiang** and **Hong Kong**
are **consistent with human rights** principles]{.underline}.13 In his
speech to the 2020 U.N. General Assembly meeting, Chinese President Xi
Jinping positioned China as a responsible stakeholder in the
international system, while criticizing "major countries" for not doing
enough to contribute --- a critique long directed by the United States
against China. Xi also announced that China will set up a "U.N. Global
Geospatial Knowledge and Innovation Center" and an "International
Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals" as part
of the U.N.'s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,14 positioning
China as a hub for international collaboration on technology.

predilections, as well as deeply held [**ideologie**s about the
**relationship** between **technology** and national
power'.]{.underline}[9](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2019.1731211)[ China's

in research and development is dominated by a focus on capabilities.
Nominally private [**Chinese technology** companies have been at **the
forefront**]{.underline} of driving China's innovation ecosystem from
[**5G** to **facial recognition** and]{.underline} other applications
supported by [artificial intelligence (**AI**)]{.underline} and the
collection of data. Technologies developed by entrepreneurs from Beijing
to Shenzhen -- with the help of transfer of know-how from international
companies seeking to enter the Chinese market, or through actual
[**indigenous innovation** and]{.underline} sometimes through
[**outright theft** of **intellectual property**]{.underline} -- are
often inherently dual use in
nature.[11](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02681307.2019.1731211) This
holds especially true [in]{.underline} the realms of AI, [**quantum

has not completed the translation of these technologies into **[military
capabilities]{.underline}**, and although the 'Revolution in Military

For this reason, [the future of smart cities is **only as great** as the
technology that **enables** them]{.underline}. [5G represents a
**critical turning point** in the evolution of smart
cities]{.underline}. [With its high-speed, low-latency, and higher
capacity wireless connectivity, 5G handles a massive number of
connections.]{.underline} [This **major leap** in network speed and
capacity allows industries to **catch up with innovation**, making it
practical to **deploy emerging tech**nologies such as]{.underline} mass
**[IoT]{.underline}** deployments, Artificial Intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**), [and **Quantum Computing**]{.underline} [into
our]{.underline} businesses and [everyday life.]{.underline}

**[Benefits of 5G]{.underline}** versus 4G

4G's speed and capacity brought us to where we are today regarding
mobile applications, navigation, and video. 4G is genuinely seen as the
generation connecting man-to-machine with the smartphone and tablet.

However, [5G boasts a **100x increase** in]{.underline} traffic capacity
and network [efficiency]{.underline}, [a **10x decrease**
in]{.underline} end-to-end [latency, and speeds over **600 times
faster** than]{.underline} the typical [4G speeds]{.underline} (Source:
Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association). That is why [many see
5G as the **machine-to-machine** generation]{.underline} of technology,
[which warrants no human interaction; machines take actions according to
sensor data.]{.underline}

[The **advanced connectivity** features of 5G, such as high
bandwidth]{.underline} and low latency [fuel the improved
machine-to-machine communication leading cities into the **new era** of
IoT-enabled applications that improve services across the industry,
including **healthcare**, **transportation**, **safety**, **energy

As technology advances, [cities encounter]{.underline} many
[opportunities in which innovative solutions can **reduce strains** and
**improve sustainability.**]{.underline}

[Smart City]{.underline} Technologies and their [Impact on Quality of
Life]{.underline}

People may not be aware, but we incorporate smart technologies
seamlessly into our daily lives, in every aspect and for the better.
Some may acknowledge the impact smart home technologies have made, such
as Amazon Alexa or Google's whole portfolio of smart speakers, lights,
cameras, apps, and tools.

These innovations are just the beginning and have already improved
convenience, cost of living, and even safety, regarding our homes and
daily routine. And, like someone's house, the [city can be
optimized]{.underline} with smart technologies [to improve]{.underline}
all facets of life, including:

**[Safety]{.underline}**

**[Health]{.underline}**

**[Environment]{.underline}**

Urban mobility

Living in a Safer and Smarter Urban Environment

Public safety is a primary target of smart cities, looking to improve
life for citizens, the government, and law enforcement by reducing crime
and improving emergency response times. For example, a McKinsey Global
Institute study points out that smart technologies could help reduce
crime by 30 to 40 percent and lead to 20 to 35 percent faster response
times for emergency services (Source: McKinsey and Company).

Of course, technology alone won't eradicate crime and guarantee safety,
but it can contribute to more efficient use of resources to prevent and
respond to threats. The Next Generation 911 (NG911) is just one example
of a technology initiative that focuses on improving public safety.
NG911 aims to disrupt the current 9-1-1 response system in place and
find better ways to put citizens in contact with emergency responders.
This includes working with voice, image, video, and text through digital
channels, leveraging IoT and fast networks instead of the traditional
analog phone lines used today.

Smart surveillance solutions, real-time crime mapping, and traffic
signal pre-emption are other examples that enable authorities to track
crime more efficiently and respond to them quicker. Police work driven
by data offers citizens more security, fairness in authority
accessibility and provides the city consistent emergency coverage
according to necessity (Source: McKinsey and Company).

#### Future pandemics cause nuclear war

The relationship between pandemics and war is as long as human history.
[Past pandemics have set the scene for wars by weakening societies,
undermining resilience, and exacerbating civil and inter-state
conflict.]{.underline} Other disease outbreaks have erupted during wars,
in part due to the appalling public health and battlefield conditions
resulting from war, in turn sowing the seeds for new conflicts. In the
post-Cold War era, pandemics have spread with unprecedented speed due to
increased mobility created by globalization, especially between
urbanized areas. Although there are positive signs that scientific
advances and rapid innovation can help us manage pandemics, it is likely
that deadly infectious viruses will be a challenge for years to come.
The COVID-19 is the most demonic pandemic threat in modern history. It
has erupted at a juncture of other existential global threats, most
importantly, accelerating climate change and resurgent nuclear
threat-making. The most important issue, therefore, is how the
coronavirus (and future pandemics) will increase or decrease the risks
associated with these twin threats, climate change effects, and the next
use of nuclear weapons in war.5

Today, [the nine nuclear weapons arsenals]{.underline} not only
[can]{.underline} annihilate hundreds of cities, but also [cause
**nuclear winter** and **mass starvation** of]{.underline} a billion or
more people, if not the **[entire human species.]{.underline}**
Concurrently, climate change is enveloping the planet with more frequent
and intense storms, accelerating sea level rise, and advancing rapid
ecological change, expressed in unprecedented forest fires across the
world. Already stretched to a breaking point in many countries, [the
current pandemic may overcome resilience to the point of near or actual
collapse of social, economic, and political order.]{.underline} In this
extraordinary moment, it is timely to reflect on the existence and
possible uses of weapons of mass destruction under pandemic conditions
-- most importantly, nuclear weapons, but also chemical and biological
weapons. [Moments of extreme crisis and vulnerability can prompt
aggressive and counterintuitive actions that in turn may destabilize
already **precariously balanced threat systems**]{.underline},
[underpinned by conventional and nuclear weapons, as well as the threat
of weaponized chemical and biological technologies]{.underline}.
Consequently, **[the risk of the use of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD),]{.underline}** **[especially nuclear weapons]{.underline}**,
**[increases]{.underline}** at such times, **[possibly
sharply]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic is clearly driving
massive, rapid, and unpredictable changes that will redefine every
aspect of the human condition, including WMD -- just as the world wars
of the first half of the 20th century led to a revolution in
international affairs and entirely new ways of organizing societies,
economies, and international relations, in part based on nuclear weapons
and their threatened use. In a world reshaped by pandemics, nuclear
weapons -- as well as correlated non-nuclear WMD, nuclear alliances,
"deterrence" doctrines, operational and declaratory policies, nuclear
extended deterrence, organizational practices, and the existential risks
posed by retaining these capabilities -- are all up for redefinition.

A [pandemic has potential to destabilize a nuclear-prone conflict by
incapacitating the supreme nuclear commander or commanders who have to
issue nuclear strike orders, creating uncertainty as to who is in
charge, how to handle nuclear mistakes]{.underline} (such as errors,
accidents, technological failures, and entanglement with conventional
operations gone awry), [and **opening a brief opportunity** for a first
strike at a time when the COVIDinfected state may not be able to
retaliate efficiently]{.underline} -- or at all -- due to leadership
confusion. In some nuclear-laden conflicts, a state might use a pandemic
as a cover for political or military provocations in the belief that the
adversary is distracted and partly disabled by the pandemic, increasing
the risk of war in a nuclear-prone conflict. At the same time, [a
pandemic may lead **nuclear armed states** to increase the **isolation
and sanctions** against a nuclear adversary,]{.underline} making it even
harder to stop the spread of the disease, in turn creating a pandemic
reservoir and transmission risk back to the nuclear armed state or its
allies.

In principle, the common threat of the pandemic might induce
nuclear-armed states to reduce the tension in a nuclear-prone conflict
and thereby the risk of nuclear war. It may cause nuclear adversaries or
their umbrella states to seek to resolve conflicts in a cooperative and
collaborative manner by creating habits of communication, engagement,
and mutual learning that come into play in the nuclear-military sphere.
For example, militaries may cooperate to control pandemic transmission,
including by working together against criminal-terrorist non-state
actors that are trafficking people or by joining forces to ensure that a
new pathogen is not developed as a bioweapon.

To date, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the isolation of
some nuclear-armed states and provided a textbook case of the failure of
states to cooperate to overcome the pandemic. [Borders have slammed
shut, trade shut down, and budgets blown out, creating **enormous
pressure** to focus on immediate domestic priorities]{.underline}.
Foreign policies have become markedly more nationalistic. Dependence on
nuclear weapons may increase as states seek to buttress a global
re-spatialization6 of all dimensions of human interaction at all levels
to manage pandemics. The effect of nuclear threats on leaders may make
it less likely -- or even impossible -- to achieve the kind of concert
at a global level needed to respond to and administer an effective
vaccine, making it harder and even impossible to revert to pre-pandemic
international relations. The result is that some **[states may
proliferate their own nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, further
**[reinforcing the spiral of conflicts contained by nuclear threat, with
cascading effects on the risk of nuclear war.]{.underline}**

Developing Pandemic-nuclear Nexus Scenarios

How might the COVID-19 pandemic (and future pandemics) create new
opportunities or challenges for governments, civil society, and market
actors to reduce nuclear risk and resume nuclear disarmament? And how
might those challenges and opportunities emerge in Northeast Asia, in
particular?

#### Diseases cause [extinction]{.underline}

pandemics\"; Guardian;
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\]

[The world is in the]{.underline} early [stages of what may be the
**most deadly pandemic** of the **past 100 years**]{.underline}. In
China, thousands of people have already died; large outbreaks have begun
in South Korea, Iran and Italy; and the rest of the world is bracing for
impact. We do not yet know whether the final toll will be measured in
thousands or hundreds of thousands. [For all our advances in medicine,
humanity remains]{.underline} much [**more vulnerable** to pandemics
than we would like to believe]{.underline}. To understand our
vulnerability, and to determine what steps must be taken to end it, it
is useful to ask about the very worst-case scenarios. Just how bad could
a pandemic be? In science fiction, we sometimes encounter the idea of [a
pandemic so severe]{.underline} that it [could cause **the end of
civilisation,** or even of **humanity itself.** Such a risk to
humanity's]{.underline} entire [future is known as an **existential
risk.** We can say]{.underline} with certainty [that]{.underline} the
novel coronavirus, named [Covid]{.underline}-19, [does not pose such a
risk. **But could the next pandemic?**]{.underline} To find out, and to
put the current outbreak into greater context, let us turn to the past.
[In 1347,]{.underline} death came to Europe. It entered through the
Crimean town of Caffa, brought by the besieging Mongol army. Fleeing
merchants unwittingly carried it back to Italy. From there, it spread to
France, Spain and England. Then up as far as Norway and across the rest
of Europe -- all the way to Moscow. Within six years, the Black Death
had taken the continent. Tens of millions fell gravely ill, their bodies
succumbing to the disease in different ways. Some bore swollen buboes on
their necks, armpits and thighs; some had their flesh turn black from
haemorrhaging beneath the skin; some coughed blood from the necrotic
inflammation of their throats and lungs. All forms involved fever,
exhaustion and an intolerable stench from the material that exuded from
the body. There were so many dead that mass graves needed to be dug and,
even then, cemeteries ran out of room for the bodies. [The Black Death
**devastated Europe.** In]{.underline} those [six years, between a
**quarter and half of all Europeans were killed**.]{.underline} [The
Middle East was ravaged, too, with the plague killing]{.underline} about
[**one in three Egyptians and Syrians**. And it may have also laid waste
to parts of central Asia, India and China.]{.underline} Due to the scant
records of the 14th century, we will never know the true toll, but our
best estimates are that [somewhere between **5% and 14% of all the
world's people were killed**]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} what may
have been [the **greatest catastrophe** humanity has seen.]{.underline}
The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. [In AD541 the
plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine empire]{.underline}. Over three
years, [it **took the lives** of roughly **3% of the world's
people.**]{.underline} When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the
two populations exposed each other to completely novel diseases. Over
thousands of years, each population had built up resistance to their own
set of diseases, but were extremely susceptible to the others. The
American peoples got by far the worse end of the exchange, through
diseases such as measles, influenza and, especially, smallpox. During
the next 100 years, a combination of invasion and disease took an
immense toll -- one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90% of the population of the Americas during
that century, though the number could also be much lower. And it is very
difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed to war and
occupation, rather than disease. At a rough estimate, as many as 10% of
the world's people may have been killed. Centuries later, the world had
become so interconnected that a truly global pandemic was possible.
Towards the end of the first world war, a devastating strain of
influenza, known as the 1918 flu or Spanish flu, spread to six
continents, and even remote Pacific islands. About a third of the
world's population were infected and between 3% and 6% were killed. This
death toll outstripped that of the first world war. Yet even events like
these fall short of being a threat to humanity's long-term potential. In
the great bubonic plagues we saw civilisation in the affected areas
falter, but recover. The regional 25%-50% death rate was not enough to
precipitate a continent-wide collapse. It changed the relative fortunes
of empires, and may have substantially altered the course of history,
but if anything, it gives us reason to believe that human civilisation
is likely to make it through future events with similar death rates,
even if they were global in scale. The Spanish flu pandemic was
remarkable in having very little apparent effect on the world's
development, despite its global reach. It looks as if it was lost in the
wake of the first world war, which, despite a smaller death toll, seems
to have had a much larger effect on the course of history. The full
history of humanity covers at least 200,000 years. While we have scarce
records for most of these 2,000 centuries, there is a key lesson we can
draw from the sheer length of our past. The chance of human extinction
from natural catastrophes of any kind must have been very low for most
of this time -- or we would not have made it so far. But could these
risks have changed? Might the past provide false comfort? [Our
population now is a **thousand times greater** than it was
for]{.underline} most of [human history, so there are]{.underline}
vastly [**more opportunities** for new **human diseases to
originate**]{.underline}**.** And our [farming practices have created
**vast numbers of animals**]{.underline} [living in **unhealthy
conditions** within **close proximity to humans**]{.underline}. [This
increases the risk]{.underline}, as many major diseases originate in
animals before crossing over to humans. Examples include HIV
(chimpanzees), Ebola (bats), Sars (probably civets or bats) and
influenza (usually pigs or birds). We do not yet know where Covid-19
came from, though it is very similar to coronaviruses found in bats and
pangolins. Evidence suggests that diseases are crossing over into human
populations from animals at an increasing rate. [**Modern civilisation**
may]{.underline} also [make it much easier for a **pandemic to
spread**]{.underline}. [The higher density of people living
together]{.underline} in cities [**increases the number of people** each
of us may infect]{.underline}. Rapid [**long-distance transport**
greatly increases the]{.underline} **[distance pathogens can
spread]{.underline}**, [reducing]{.underline} the [**degrees of
separation** between any two people]{.underline}. Moreover, we are no
longer divided into isolated populations as we were for most of the past
10,000 years. Together [these effects suggest that we might expect
**more new pandemics**, for them to **spread more quickly**, and to
reach a **higher percentage** of the **world's people**.]{.underline}
But we have also changed the world in ways that offer protection. We
have a healthier population; improved sanitation and hygiene;
preventative and curative medicine; and a scientific understanding of
disease. Perhaps most importantly, we have public health bodies to
facilitate global communication and coordination in the face of new
outbreaks. We have seen the benefits of this protection through the
dramatic decline of endemic infectious disease over the past century
(though we can't be sure pandemics will obey the same trend). Finally,
we have spread to a range of locations and environments unprecedented
for any mammalian species. This offers special protection from
extinction events, because it requires the pathogen to be able to
flourish in a vast range of environments and to reach exceptionally
isolated populations such as uncontacted tribes, Antarctic researchers
and nuclear submarine crews. It is hard to know whether these combined
effects have increased or decreased the existential risk from pandemics.
This uncertainty is ultimately bad news: [we were previously sitting on
a powerful argument that the **risk was tiny**; now **we are
not.**]{.underline} We have seen the indirect ways that our actions aid
and abet the origination and spread of pandemics. But what about cases
where we have a much more direct hand in the process -- where we
deliberately use, improve or create the pathogens? Our understanding and
control of pathogens is very recent. Just 200 years ago, we didn't even
understand the basic cause of pandemics -- a leading theory in the west
claimed that disease was produced by a kind of gas. In just two
centuries, we discovered it was caused by a diverse variety of
microscopic agents and we worked out how to grow them in the lab, to
breed them for different traits, to sequence their genomes, to implant
new genes and to create entire functional viruses from their written
code. This progress is continuing at a rapid pace. The past 10 years
have seen major qualitative breakthroughs, such as the use of the gene
editing tool Crispr to efficiently insert new genetic sequences into a
genome, and the use of gene drives to efficiently replace populations of
natural organisms in the wild with genetically modified versions. This
progress in biotechnology seems unlikely to fizzle out anytime soon:
there are no insurmountable challenges looming; no fundamental laws
blocking further developments. But it would be optimistic to assume that
this uncharted new terrain holds only familiar dangers. To start with,
let's set aside the risks from malicious intent, and consider only the
risks that can arise from well-intentioned research. Most **[scientific
and medical research]{.underline}** poses a negligible risk of harms at
the scale we are considering. But there is a small fraction that [uses
**live pathogens** of kinds that are known to **threaten global
harm**]{.underline}. [These include the agents that cause]{.underline}
the **[Spanish flu, smallpox, Sars and H5N1 or avian flu]{.underline}**.
And [a small part of this research involves **making strains** of these
pathogens that pose **even more danger** than the natural types,
increasing]{.underline} [their **transmissibility**]{.underline},
lethality or resistance to vaccination or treatment. [In
2012]{.underline}, a Dutch virologist, [Ron Fouchier, published details
of an experiment on the]{.underline} recent H5N1 strain of [bird flu.
This]{.underline} [strain was]{.underline} extremely [deadly, killing an
estimated **60% of humans it infected**]{.underline} -- far beyond even
the Spanish flu. [Yet its inability to pass from human to human had so
far **prevented a pandemic**]{.underline}. Fouchier wanted to find out
whether (and how) H5N1 could naturally develop this ability. He passed
the disease through a series of 10 ferrets, which are commonly used as a
model for how influenza affects humans. By the time it passed to the
final ferret, his strain of H5N1 had become directly transmissible
between mammals. The work caused fierce controversy. Much of this was
focused on the information contained in his work. The US National
Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity ruled that his paper had to be
stripped of some of its technical details before publication, to limit
the ability of bad actors to cause a pandemic. And the Dutch government
claimed that the research broke EU law on exporting information useful
for bioweapons. But it is not the possibility of misuse that concerns me
here. Fouchier's research provides a clear example of well-intentioned
scientists enhancing the destructive capabilities of pathogens known to
threaten global catastrophe. Of course, such experiments are done in
secure labs, with stringent safety standards. It is highly unlikely that
in any particular case the enhanced pathogens would escape into the
wild. But just how unlikely? Unfortunately, [we don't have good
data]{.underline}, [due to a lack of transparency about
incident]{.underline} and escape [rates]{.underline}. [This prevents
society from making well-informed decisions balancing the risks and
benefits of this research]{.underline}, and it limits the ability of
labs to learn from each other's incidents. [Security for highly
dangerous pathogens has been **deeply flawed**, and remains
insufficient.]{.underline} In 2001, Britain was struck by a devastating
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. Six million animals
were killed in an attempt to halt its spread, and the economic damages
totalled £8bn. Then, in 2007, there was another outbreak, which was
traced to a lab working on the disease. [Foot-and-mouth was considered a
**highest-category pathogen**,]{.underline} and required the highest
level of biosecurity. [Yet the virus escaped from a **badly maintained
pipe**, leaking into the **groundwater at the facility**. After an
investigation, the **lab's licence was renewed**]{.underline} -- [only
for **another leak to occur two weeks later.**]{.underline} In my view,
[this track record of escapes shows that even the **highest biosafety
level** (BSL-4) is **insufficient for working on pathogens** that pose a
risk of global pandemics on the scale of the Spanish flu]{.underline} or
worse. Thirteen years since the last publicly acknowledged outbreak from
[a **BSL-4 facility** is not good enough.]{.underline} It doesn't matter
whether this is from insufficient standards, inspections, operations or
penalties. What matters is the poor track record in the field, made
worse by a lack of transparency and accountability. [With current BSL-4
labs, an **escape of a pandemic pathogen** is only a **matter of
time.**]{.underline}

when, at the suggestion of Mikhail Gorbachev, it adopted the "Resolution
on International Environmental Security" in 1987 as a reaction to the
Chernobyl environmental and human tragedy (Our Common Future 1987, 7).
In its report entitled "Our Common Future", the World Commission on
Environment and Development (the so-called Brundtland Commission)
proposed that "the whole notion of security as traditionally understood
in terms of political and military threats to national sovereignty -
must be expanded to include the growing impacts of environmental
stress - locally, nationally, regionally, and globally" (Ibid). Author
Seyom Brown distinguishes seven world interests considering that the
modern understanding of security implies not only national, but also
global, world security, which implies the protection and realization of
world interests, focused on the needs of humanity "because it spatially
encompasses the interests of all peoples and nations on Earth":

> \(1\) the survival of the human species;
>
> \(2\) reducing the killing and elimination of others;
>
> \(3\) the lack of conditions for a healthy life for all people;
>
> \(4\) protection of civil rights;
>
> \(5\) respect for the right of peoples and numerous ethnic groups to
> cultural diversity;
>
> \(6\) environmental protection - irresponsible attitude towards the
> natural environment \[\...\] produces consequences in a wider space
> and over time; often at first glance it is not possible to see how
> disregard for long-term consequences \[\...\], ultimately endangers
> the interests of all people and nations \[\...\], and
>
> \(7\) expanding accountability/responsibility (Brown 1998, 8-10).

It can be concluded that, although Gorbachev introduced the term after
the Chernobyl tragedy, 32 years after that terrible event which clearly
showed what could happen, the humanity still does not give enough
importance to negotiations as a tool for avoiding conflicts and wars,
especially taking into consideration the present Atomic era. It has to
be underlined that climate change, caused by many negative environmental
human activities including hypothetical possibility of an atomic tragedy
and the political and global interests of world powers, causees lack of
ecological security. Another example of belittling ecological security
is the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on
climate change mitigation in June 2017, as well as their unilateral
withdrawal in 2019 from the nuclear agreement with Russia, which has
been in force since 1987. Given the threateningly unpleasant increase in
conflicts and wars in the 21st century worldwide, which can be observed
as the general concept of wars for strategic resources, the ecological
security of the entire planet is highly endangered. It can be noted that
the ecological security i.e., environmental safety is related to general
concept of safety. It concerns the degree of destruction of local and
global ecosystems; water shortages, floods; mass and irrational
deforestation; environmental pollution and biodiversity depletion. It
can be concluded that the conflicts and wars of 21 st century, waged
with new and increasingly toxic weapons, threaten life on the planet,
and together with the negative changes in the environment caused by new
technologies of post-industrial development, lead to the ecological
crisis of modern civilization. Thus, taking into consideration opinion
of the proponents of the expanded idea of security, any problem related
to the environment and the worrying fact of climate change is also a
security problem. Author Norman Myers, on the other hand, believes that
not all environmental problems lead to a violent conflict, but looking
in the long term, a causal link can be found between environmental
issues and policy changes (Myers 2004, 3).

Author Thomas Homer-Dixon singles out hypotheses of three groups
environmental security threats and challenges:

> -- the first group is represented by conflicts between states that, at
> the same time, consider that they have the right to exploit the same
> natural resources;
>
> -- the second group are various migrations of population, which
> consequently occur due to various environmental disasters and
> catastrophes in cases when different ethno-religious groups settle in
> new areas, so there are divisions and conflicts between them, because
> they do not share the same norms and values;
>
> -- the third group of threats refers to the demise of public
> institutions and internal "social instability", which can lead to
> conflicts of unprecedented proportions, and are caused by endangering
> the population due to disappearance of natural resources, energy and
> raw materials, environmental pollution, climate change, natural
> disasters caused by human negligence, etc. (Homer-Dixon 1994, 3-4).
> Thus, it can be observed that contemporary security threats are caused
> in high extent by internal conflicts and conflicts between states as
> well in no lesser extent. In the modern era, the stability and peace
> of a state can be endangered not only by other states, but by
> internalstate inefficient management as well.

Author Simić states that Sigmund Freud called the emergence of conflict
on the basis of cultural and religious identity within a state
"narcissism of small differences" and that the term first appeared in
Freud\'s 1929 work entitled "Civilization and Its Dissatisfaction",
representing the idea that it is precisely the small differences between
people who are otherwise similar that form the basis of feelings of
alienation and enmity between them (Simić 2002, 49-50). Simić explains
that the main consequence that arises from such an internal conflict is
the spread of the conflict to nearby, neighboring countries, regions,
and even beyond; manifestations of social dangers, endangering something
or someone can be unintentional - unconscious or intentional - conscious
(Ibid). The author gives an example that technological development is
aimed to improve the quality of life, but through inappropriate
application, it can lead to endangering the natural basis of human
existence on the planet Earth (Ibid). It can be concluded that, eighteen
years after the previously mentioned warning, technological development
started to be one of the main reasons for rapid climate change and
deterioration of ecological security.

This can also be confirmed through the author\'s Cherry classification,
according to which ecological security should deal with maintaining the
optimal relationship between organisms, i.e., animal rights issues, the
legal status of nature, and the relationship between humans and nature
(Cherry 1995, 87). Cherry indicates three kinds of approaches such as:

>  The nature-centric, which starts from an understanding of nature as
> a separate entity and ecology as a science that deals with relations
> between organisms and their environment.
>
>  The second approach Cheery calls human-centric, and explains that
> environmental safety is based on a man as a user and controller of
> nature. The basis for interpreting the environmental safety of this
> approach are problems related to natural resources, considering the
> so-called "environmental refugees" and conflicts between people in
> relation to the environment, as well as the role of international
> governmental and non-governmental organizations in creating
> international security through the creation of policies and
> international law.
>
>  The third approach Cherry considers as being best described as
> eclectic. It seeks to contribute to a general insight into the
> phenomenon of environmental safety, taking into account the
> interdependence between life forms, ecosystems, the social system,
> individuals and the technical system (Ibid, 87-89).

It can be concluded that there are a lot of threats to ecological
security and that they can be observed in two wide groups. The first
group of threats is presented by forms and origins of dangers that are
out of range of human influence, and the second group of threats lay
within the borders of human influences.

Authors Naude and Alcorta warn that "human-induced climate change and
its effects on global development is part of the more general challenge
of achieving environmental sustainability. It requires a rethink of the
process and outputs of production and of distribution and consumption"
(Naude and Alcorta 2010). They agree with the opinion expressed by Sachs
that "the global economy is literally unsustainable now and cannot
absorb further economic and population growth without serious risks of
global destabilization -- even collapse" (Sachs 2009). It can be
concluded that a lot of authors indicate the threats caused by human
influences as a major risk for ecological security of the world.

Author Arthur Westing starts from the relationship between people and
nature and believes that natural resources are a prerequisite for human
well-being and survival (Westing 1989, 129). In his opinion, population
growth and the aspiration for the entire population to reach the
standard of living of developed countries contributes to the negative
impact on the environment, and the struggle for natural resources can
lead to conflict (Ibid). Linking the environment and security, in the
context of defining human security, he underlines the intertwining of
political security, which includes military, economic and
social/humanitarian sub-components, and security related to
environmental protection (Ibid). Regarding ecological security, it can
be observed that it is a new, modern form of security which appeared as
a necessity for prevention of environmental threats, with a role to
protect the components of the environment which are basic for the
survival of living beings. Ecological security calls for encouragement
and requirements to involve as many participants as possible in order to
implement policies, not only to survive but as well to improve the
quality of life of the population and ecology. It can be concluded that,
although ecological crisis is one of the most dangerous features of 21st
century civilization, political rulers of the world still do not
undertake any major globally accepted actions for enforcing ecological
security in order to provide survival of living beings and the nature.

2\. Climate strike

The climate situation in 2020 is difficult, as shown by the findings of
European Climate Change Monitoring Service  Copernicus. The average
temperature in January 2020 was 3.1 degrees Celsius higher than the
average January temperature, which makes it the warmest in the last four
decades (Copernicus 2020). Lauren Fox quotes that the Esperanza Research
Center in Antarctica in February 2020 measured a temperature of 18.3°C,
the highest temperature ever since 1961, when measurements began there
(Fox 2020). Authors Wennersten and Robbins underline that "we are now
witnessing the human devastation of the earth" (Wennersten & Robbins
2017, 32). It can be concluded that there is an urgent need for a better
model of development for the survival of humanity. Author Miltojevic
indicates the grate disadvantage of the new industrial mode of
production, concluding that technical progress "deepens contradictions
between anthropogenic expansive activities and limited potentials of
existing natural resources" (Miltojevic 2002, 254).

Even in a state of strictly individualistic capitalism, such as the
United States, it is no coincidence that Benny Sanders appeared in the
2019 presidential race, expressing many actually socialist ideas in his
program, such as free health care and education. This fact illustrates
the extent of unsustainability of the system, in which both America and
all of humanity now exist, in the long run. The idea of sustainability
is based on the \"triangle of sustainable development\", widelyaccepted
concept proposed by Munasinghe at the 1992 earth Summit in Rio. This
concept includes environmental protection, economic security and social
justice, and opposes to a strictly profitable social development
strategy, which is global but has led to environmental crisis
(Munasinghe 2010, 11).

It can be stated that the 21st century brought up global inequality and
a great gap between ultra-rich and other habitants. Specifically, during
the year of 2020, marked by COVID-19 pandemic, it leads to great
unemployment and austerity and very uneven differentiated regional
development in the world. Thus, all of these factors brought social
insecurity. The previously described dangerous economic situation causes
the lack of environmental protection. Accordingly, the humanity does not
properly invest into environment but widely exploit it. It can be stated
that all the previously mentioned factors have inexcusable negative
effect on environmental security and trigger fundamental damage of
people\'s quality of life which further on may cause risk of conflicts
spreading.

It can be observed that the regional development of the entire globe is
very uneven. Author Šimleša underlines that the so-called benefits of
economic globalization and the rule of the market lead virtually
everywhere in the world to reduced funding for social assistance,
education and health care, to unfair privatizations and to elimination
of the concept of "public good" (Šimleša 2000, 110). It can be concluded
that all these factors do not allow implementation of the concept of
sustainable development and thus reduce the level of social security,
which lead to first climate strike in history.

According to Laville and Watts, Greta Thunberg, climate activist has
inspired four million people to the Global Climate Strike on September
20th, 2019, the largest youth environmental protest in history (Laville
& Watts 2019). It can be concluded that, although without the
decarbonization of the world economy the planet will be destroyed,
political circles are not implementing enough international actions in
order to cause a global turn towards green economy. Accordingly, the
previously mentioned climate strike tries to increase global
consciousness regarding ecological security.

3\. Climate change as the seed of geopolitical change and danger of
world conflicts

Climate change is manifesting itself in an increasing number of natural
disasters, affecting the decline of the power of states and endangering
world security. The World Bank report for 2018 estimates that Latin
America, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia will generate 143 million
climate migrants by 2050 (Kumari Rigaud et al. 2018, 2). China, Taiwan,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam are in conflict over the
South China Sea resources due to overfishing and water pollution
(Fridtjof Nansens Institute 2017). According to Evagelos, conflict
situation in the Arctic between the USA (Alaska), Canada, Russia,
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Greenland are related to climate
change, shrinking ice surface of Arctic and conflict for large oil and
gas deposits and fish stocks. The Arctic warming is happening twice as
fast as anywhere on the Earth (Evagelos 2018). It can be concluded that
the rivalry of the Arctic nations also leads to destruction of the fish
wealth of the Arctic, leading further to environmental crisis and
environmental unsafety, which represents a fruitful seed for conflicts
between the Arctic nations. It can be observed that problems that arose
in the environment as a consequence of anthropogenic action, led to a
different angle of thinking about connection between environmental
problems and safety in the end of 20th and in the first two decades of
21st century. The connection between the environment and war conflicts
was pointed out through "research on environmental and security issues
related to global environmental change, environmental scarcity,
degradation and stress, as well as their possible socio-political
consequences" (Jovanović Popović 2013, 106). In fact, as the author
Bajagić indicates, the growing manifestation of environmental problems
contributes to security being defined not only as the protection of the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of the state. Moreover,
contemporary discussions on security include research into multiple and
complex relations and processes between states and within the state
(Bajagić 2006, 222). It can be concluded that the said discussions are
oriented extensively towards relations between human society and nature.
Increasing pressure on natural resources causes demographic, economic
and political dangerous conflict changes. Autor Lee indicates: "The
seeds of conflict will lie in massive migrations, border tensions and
disputes over essential resources" (Lee 2009, 82). "The changing climate
has always been a factor in the rise and fall of peoples and
civilizations. This phenomenon is often accompanied by conflict \..."
(Ibid, 166). Wennersten and Robbins underline that "[[**climate
refugees**, once]{.underline}]{.mark} thought to be [a problem
**[confined]{.mark}** to segments of the]{.underline}
**[developing]{.underline}** [world, [are on the **verge** of]{.mark}
becoming [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[global
problem]{.underline}**]{.mark}" (Wennersten & Robbins 2017, 32).
[Although]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} Climate Agreement
[entered into force]{.underline} on November 4, 2016, the [climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} **[still [contributes to
migration]{.mark}]{.underline}** [due to]{.underline}
[**desertification**, rising]{.underline} [**sea levels**,
**pollution**]{.underline} of the oceans, air, land, rainy seasons
changes and loss of biodiversity. Environmental protection is not
effective. [Ecological migrations are **evidence** to]{.underline} that
**[inefficiency]{.underline}**. The UN states that [[from]{.mark}
20[**02** to]{.mark} 20**[12]{.mark}**, climate change [affected]{.mark}
the lives of]{.underline} [**[4]{.mark}**.4 **[billion]{.mark}**
people]{.underline} (UNHCR Factsheet 2019). It should be noted that
**[[impending]{.underline}]{.mark}** [disasters [are **huge
migrations**]{.mark} **of the population**]{.underline} due to lack of
food, water and land, and frequency of **[intra-state]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[[inter-state conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** over
resources. Climate change is also affecting the emergence of various
[**[epidemics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[diseases]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Authors Welzer and Camiller (2015)
state that "whether wars in the twentyfirst century are directly or
indirectly due to climate change, [[violence has a]{.underline} **[great
future]{.underline}**]{.mark} ahead of it. [[We shall see]{.mark} not
**only [mass migration]{.mark}**[, but also]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[violent solutions]{.underline}** [to

\..." (Welzer & Camiller, 2015, 6). It can be concluded that climate
change is a dangerous factor that leads to [migration of human
population on Earth]{.underline}, and that it [is [a]{.mark} large
[**precondition** for]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[spread of
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### **Air pollution causes [extinction]{.underline}**

**St. Martin '22** \[Victoria St. Martin, 5-17-2022, \"Study Identifies
Outdoor Air Pollution as the 'Largest Existential Threat to Human and
Planetary Health',\" Inside Climate News,
<https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17052022/outdoor-air-pollution-health/>,
St. Mark's, AM\]

Since the turn of the century, [global deaths attributable to air
pollution have increased by **more than half,** a development that
researchers say underscores the **impact of pollution** as the
"**largest existential threat**]{.underline} to human and planetary
health."

The findings, part of a study published Tuesday in The Lancet Planetary
Health, found that [pollution was responsible]{.underline} for an
estimated [9 million deaths]{.underline} around the world in 2019. Fully
half of those fatalities, 4.5 million deaths, were the result of
ambient, or outdoor, air pollution, which is typically emitted by
vehicles and industrial sources like power plants and factories.

[The number of deaths that can be attributed to ambient air pollution
has increased by about **55 percent**]{.underline}---to 4.5 million from
2.9 million---[since]{.underline} the year [2000]{.underline}.

[Deaths from]{.underline} ambient air and chemical [pollution were so
prevalent]{.underline}, the study's authors said, [that they offset a
decline in the number of deaths from other pollution
sources]{.underline} typically related to conditions of extreme poverty,
[including]{.underline} indoor air pollution and [water
pollution.]{.underline}

"[Pollution is]{.underline} still [the **largest existential
threat**]{.underline} to human and planetary health [and jeopardizes the
**sustainability** of]{.underline} modern **[societies]{.underline}**,"
said Philip Landrigan, a co-author of the report who directs the Global
Public Health Program and Global Pollution Observatory at Boston
College.

The report noted that countries with lower collective incomes often bear
a disproportionate share of the impacts of pollution deaths, and called
on governments, businesses and other entities to abandon fossil fuels
and adopt clean energy sources.

"Despite its enormous health, social and economic impacts, [pollution
prevention is]{.underline} largely **[overlooked]{.underline}** [in the
international]{.underline} development [agenda]{.underline}," says
Richard Fuller, the study's lead author, who is the founder and CEO of
the nonprofit environmental group Pure Earth. "[Attention and funding
has only **minimally increased**]{.underline} since 2015, despite
well-documented increases in public concern about pollution and its
health effects."

The peer-reviewed study, produced by the 2017 Lancet Commission on
Pollution and Health, using data from the 2015 Global Burden of Disease
(GBD), found that roughly 1.2 million deaths were attributable to
household air pollution (which generally comes from tobacco smoke,
household products and appliances); about 1.3 million deaths were
attributable to water pollution and 900,000 deaths were attributable to
lead pollution.

Pollution\'s Fatal Toll

All told, the study's authors wrote, roughly **[16 percent of
deaths]{.underline}** around the world [are attributable to
**pollution**]{.underline}, [which resulted in more than **\$4
trillion** in]{.underline} global [economic losses.]{.underline}

Ambient [air pollution can be generated by a **range of
sources**]{.underline}, including wildfires.

### Smart Cities\-\--5G Key\-\--2AC

#### 5G [enables]{.underline} smart city creation -- security, infrastructure, and communication

**Contento '21** \[Marco Contento, 8-13-2021, \"5G and the Smart City,\"
Telit, <https://www.telit.com/blog/5g-smart-city/>, St. Mark's, AM\]

[Looking at]{.underline} both present and [near-future
possibilities]{.underline}, let's explore some [5G smart city
applications]{.underline}.

**[Traffic Management]{.underline}** and Analytics

Many [cities]{.underline} use or [are interested in Intelligent Traffic
Systems]{.underline} (**[ITS]{.underline}**), [designed to **limit
congestion**]{.underline} on roadways. Such systems monitor traffic and
use AI and machine learning to identify patterns and change key elements
(e.g., traffic light cycles at certain times of the day) to reduce
congestion.

Depending on the system, legacy technology may provide adequate
connectivity. Yet [if a city wants to stream]{.underline} high-quality
video [for **real-time analysis**]{.underline}, [5G's high bandwidth
will help]{.underline}. Some cities in China monitor traffic with video
cameras. They [use multi-access edge computing (**MEC**]{.underline})
[for video processing and **5G**]{.underline} [for uplink to the
cloud-based analytics engine and data lakes.]{.underline}

**[Smart Utilities and Metering]{.underline}**

[5G will have a **massive impact**]{.underline} [on utilities, including
**infrastructure** changes]{.underline}. [Today's smart meters tend to
be]{.underline} **[low-power devices]{.underline}** [with minimal
throughput needs]{.underline}. [Smart utilities' **power generation and
grids** will reap **immediate 5G benefits**]{.underline}. [The utility
company needs to **synchronize power sources** for wind farms to keep
the ultimate current generated in phase.]{.underline}

[5G will provide **dependable connectivity** for **frequency
regulation**]{.underline} ([i.e., an automatic power adjustment to
stabilize and synchronize power to **avoid outages**]{.underline}).
[Utility companies]{.underline} looking into and implementing private
LTE will have the option to [upgrade to]{.underline} private [5G
networks for added]{.underline} **[performance and
security]{.underline}**.

**[5G for Public Safety]{.underline}**

Most [first responder]{.underline} cellular [systems]{.underline} such
as FirstNet in the U.S. [are based on LTE]{.underline} technology. There
is early support for a public radio system in 5G. [Operators are
considering]{.underline} devices for FirstNet on [5G]{.underline} bands.
[To make this function]{.underline}, [designers will need to **develop
devices** to support both technologies]{.underline}. Beyond radio
communication, [there are multiple **potential 5G applications** in
first responder technology, including:]{.underline}

**[Connected headsets]{.underline}**

**[Body cams]{.underline}**

[Augmented reality **smart glasses**]{.underline}

**[Vital signs monitors]{.underline}**

Th[ese devices could benefit from 5G's higher bandwidth and]{.underline}
robust **[security]{.underline}**. [5G can prompt **further
development** of devices to help first responders do their
jobs.]{.underline}

**[Public Transit]{.underline}**

Most [public transportation sensors monitor the physical position of
trains and buses]{.underline}. However, some cities are [looking at 5G's
additional benefits.]{.underline} A Swiss company is
**[integrat]{.underline}**ing [5G in their GPS tracking device to
provide broadband connectivity for train passengers.]{.underline}
[Airlines may do this]{.underline} on private and commercial jets [to
provide onboard connectivity]{.underline}. For automakers, [5G will
provide **vehicle-to-vehicle** and **vehicle-to-infrastructure
communications**]{.underline} [to enable **autonomous** public
transportation]{.underline}.

**[Smart Buildings]{.underline}**

Smart buildings present a complex scenario with many possible situations
and applications. Older cellular technology may remain dominant for
several years, except when it's inconvenient to install wired
connections. In those cases, 5G can be considered.

[As 5G becomes available, it will be a natural part of **smart building
infrastructure**]{.underline}. When Rel 17 improves massive IoT and
low-power sensor performance and price points, [smart buildings will
**benefit** from]{.underline} making [the shift]{.underline}. [Buildings
with temperature sensors to measure heat consumption rely on
Wi-Fi]{.underline} connectivity, [which can be **spotty** and
**cyberthreat vulnerable**]{.underline}. [In a world where 5G is
ubiquitous, **data flow** from those sensors will become much more
**dependable** and **easier to secure.**]{.underline}

**[Autonomous Vehicles]{.underline}**

[5G will be crucial for the auto industry to enable **safe and
effective** autonomous vehicle operation]{.underline}. **[Self-driving
cars]{.underline}** [depend on sensor technologies and onboard
computers]{.underline}. [They must retain **constant
connectivity**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} GPS
[satellites]{.underline} and a tiered cloud-based system. [5G will
enable **vehicle-to-vehicle communication** so self-driving cars can
share roadways with one another]{.underline} (and human drivers).

**[Electric Vehicles]{.underline}**

[5G will impact]{.underline} the **[distribution of
energy]{.underline}** [for electric vehicles]{.underline}. [**Current**
power networks **cannot support** vast numbers of electric
cars.]{.underline} One possible [solution is **energy sharing**. If a
solar-powered charging station is connected to the grid and **not in
use** or not being used to full capacity, it can **cogenerate into the
grid**.]{.underline}

**[Public Illumination]{.underline}**

[Smart lighting is another use case]{.underline} that will function well
with low-power wide-area network technology for the foreseeable future.
This application doesn't have an immediate need to switch to 5G.
However, [as 5G infrastructure rolls out]{.underline}, some [cities may
consider **dual-usage smart streetlights** to provide light and 5G
coverage]{.underline}. [We will likely see many **dual-use
applications** incorporating 5G with existing tech]{.underline}nology
[to provide improved services]{.underline}.

**[5G Cybersecurity]{.underline}**

[Cybersecurity is a **legitimate concern** for connected smart city
devices]{.underline}. With IoT's lack of regulation and clear security
standards, [devices can have hardware and software
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. City IT officials must choose
providers with a proven security track record to ensure security. As it
will enable massive numbers of connected devices, [5G will highlight the
need for robust security policies.]{.underline} [Smart city designers
must be **vigilant** in pursuing **secure solutions** to **offset
risks.**]{.underline}

[While 5G impacts connectivity, it will **create space** for many
**innovations** to match its capabilities]{.underline}. These
innovations will include new devices and software platforms to manage
complex analytics. [A smart meter might monitor]{.underline} a
building's [energy consumption]{.underline} throughout the day and night
[and adjust prices]{.underline} based on current demand. The meter might
then notify the user via the utility's smartphone app (or interactive
screen on the connected thermostat). **[Diverse smart city
applications]{.underline}** [working in concert will become an
integrated system.]{.underline} [5G will **enable** these]{.underline}
additional [use cases, **enhancing** the number of services
and]{.underline} escalating [their complexity.]{.underline}

### Smart Cities\-\--5G Key\-\--1AR

#### Fully integrated projects [fail now]{.underline} -- only 5G solves

**Castro '19** \[Daniel, Castro is the vice president of the Information
Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) and director of the Center
for Data Innovation, January 2019; \"5G Can Enable Smart Cities --- If
Policymakers Allow It,\" GovTech,
<https://www.govtech.com/fs/infrastructure/5g-can-enable-smart-cities-if-policymakers-allow-it.html>,
St. Mark's, AM\]

Many [cities are striving to become "**smart**"]{.underline} ---
[communities at the forefront of using data, sensors and connected
devices to improve government services and residents' quality of life
through analytics and automation. Smart cities promise to
deliver]{.underline} notable advances, such as [less roadway
congestion]{.underline} from smart traffic signals, [more effective
**health**]{.underline} and safety inspections with predictive
analytics, [and **more transparency**]{.underline} with real-time
dashboards showing citizens when to expect the next snowplow or garbage
truck to come through their neighborhood.

[But for most cities]{.underline}, especially those [in the
U.S.,]{.underline} [becoming a fully functioning smart city is a **dream
still** only on the horizon]{.underline}. While many have launched
important [smart city initiatives]{.underline}, these [tend to be
**one-off projects** instead of **fully integrated** smart city efforts
that modernize city governments from top to bottom.]{.underline} [Yet
**comprehensive** smart city efforts are necessary to **fully extract**
the value that data analytics can deliver to government.]{.underline}

[One step cities can take to come closer to]{.underline} realizing their
vision of [becoming a smart city is **accelerating** the deployment of
**5G wireless** networks]{.underline}. [5G]{.underline}, [which offers
**faster connections**, more **reliability** and greater **capacity** at
lower costs]{.underline}, [will **enable** cities to **better connect**
their infrastructure, devices and people]{.underline}. Moreover,
[compared to the current 4G]{.underline} standard, [5G offers the
capacity to enable **additional** smart city capabilities, and it will
be a **prerequisite** to enable various high-bandwidth and low-latency
smart city applications.]{.underline} For example, [5G will support the
**wide-scale deployment** of **connected vehicles** communicating with
traffic signals to reduce traffic as well as the deployment of large
numbers of sensors to measure in real time the **safety of
infrastructure** such as water pipes, highways and
buildings.]{.underline}

#### Specifically, [5G security]{.underline} is necessary for [smart city]{.underline} development

**Park & Shalla '21** \[Sung Jin and Kristi, Park earned her PhD in

Security and Data Protection

[As we enter the era of dynamic development in smart city
infrastructure]{.underline}, the issue of [online **security** looms
large on the horizon]{.underline} [because so much of our personal
information is]{.underline} being housed [in digital
locations]{.underline}. [There are worries that the high level of
**dependencies on 5G** puts cities at a **greater risk of
hacking**]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} in part
**[true]{.underline}** [in the sense that wireless networks are more
**vulnerable to cyber-attacks**]{.underline} than wired networks. [In
the case of wireless communications]{.underline}, **[no physical access
is required]{.underline}**, [and network **boundaries are
blurred**.]{.underline} [These attributes tend to **allow more
unauthorized access** opportunities compared with wired
networks.]{.underline}

[There are approaches that cities can take]{.underline} in order [to
obtain a **secured 5G network**]{.underline}. The first is to build a
private 5G [network]{.underline} - a dedicated closed 5G mobile network
that meets location-specific coverage and can be exclusively used only
by authorized devices. Secondly, [cities can implement technologies and
regulations **encrypting field-level data**]{.underline}. [A lot of edge
devices or servers have offered **data encryption**]{.underline}
[functions]{.underline}. [The transmission of encrypted data can
**minimize** 5G network attacks.]{.underline}

Lastly, [it is the adoption of **quantum cryptographic communication**
technologies]{.underline}. [Quantum's unique mechanics **block any type
of cyber-attacks** during transmission **more effectively** than in
wired networks, and the deployment of **secure 5G** communications using
**quantum cryptography** has been tested and being **expanded** across
the world]{.underline} starting from South Korea. In reality, only
greenfield cities can design and build a fully secured smart city
implementing a private 5G, the data encryption governance of IoT
devices, and the application of quantum science. The dominant number of
cities is likely to apply only part of the solutions against
cyberattacks and gradually implement them. It remains uncertain how to
balance cybersecurity worries over 5G and the promise and potential of
5G for smart cities.

### Smart Cities\-\--5G Key\-\--QKD\-\--1AR

#### QKD is key to beat China's telecom dominance 

**Xchange '19** \[Quantum Xchange, 5-21-2019, \"How QKD Answers Huawei's
Looming Threat to the U.S. Telecom Market,\" QuantumXC,
<https://quantumxc.com/blog/qkd-huawei-telecom-market/>, St. Mark's,
AM\]

Whether we like it or not, [China's]{.underline} major telecom provider,
Huawei, is [infiltrating the]{.underline} global [telecom
market.]{.underline}

Last week, the Trump administration banned American companies from doing
business with Huawei. Shortly after, Google cut ties with the company.

But does the door to potential spying by the Chinese government still
remain open?

While some of the biggest domestic telecom firms like AT&T and Verizon
Wireless have promised to avoid Huawei equipment in their 5G wireless
networks, this doesn't rule out rural carriers. Huawei also plans to
roll out their own operating system next year, meaning reliance on
American companies will be negligible.

"We are going to have to figure out a way in a 5G world that we're able
to manage the risks in a diverse network that includes technology that
we can't trust," Sue Gordon, Deputy to the Director of National
Intelligence explained in a recent Washington Post article.

[Huawei's momentum will be **hard to stop**, and that means we need a
**better way to encrypt**]{.underline} our vital
[communications]{.underline}. This is the [perfect opportunity for
**quantum telecom**]{.underline}, to become part of the [solution.
Quantum telecom is simply the process of communicating securely over
**long distances** by harnessing the power of quantum physics,
through]{.underline} Quantum Key Distribution (**[QKD]{.underline}**).

[The Huawei **Cybersecurity Threat**]{.underline}

Chinese tech giant Huawei was founded in 1987 by a former Chinese
People's Liberation Army officer, with the support of the Chinese
government. It has grown to be the second-largest smartphone maker as
well as a global leader in 5G wireless networks.

A 2012 US House of Representatives' report called the company a national
security threat, while U.S. intelligence agencies (NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.)
have articulated the same cybersecurity concerns, urging U.S. citizens
not to use Huawei products and services. Considering that the Chinese
government heavily subsidizes the company, the cybersecurity concerns
are not unfounded even though Huawei officials strongly deny allegations
of any ties to or influence from the Chinese government.

U.S. Efforts to Manage the Threat

Stemming from the concern that Huawei will use its products to spy for
China and steal intellectual property, the U.S banned government
agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products and services in the
latest National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). In May, the Trump
administration also banned U.S. companies from doing business with the
Chinese telecom company.

At the same time, the U.S. has been lobbying hard (but rather
unsuccessfully) to get our allies to follow suit. So far Australia and
New Zealand have taken measures to restrict the use of Huawei products,
but England just signed an agreement with the company allowing it to
help build "non-core" components of the UK's 5G infrastructure.
Moreover, the European Commission decided recently not to warn European
Union member nations against contracting with the company; and
[NATO]{.underline} likewise [chose not to impose a blanket ban on the
company]{.underline} for its member nations.

What is the Answer? [Developing Tech]{.underline}nology [to
Safeguard]{.underline} Our [Networks]{.underline}

While Huawei continues spreading through telecom markets overseas, the
company is fighting the U.S. ban and has sued the US government, stating
that the ban is unconstitutional. Whether it will be successful in
fighting that battle remains to be seen, but Huawei's influence and the
threat it poses will remain.

Carriers all over the world are getting ready to [move]{.underline} from
4G LTE [to 5G]{.underline} this year, promising ultra-fast data speeds
and allowing more data to travel on wireless networks. Unfortunately,
this also [opens the door]{.underline} wider [to individuals who want to
**steal the data**]{.underline} [off those networks]{.underline}. [The
challenge will be for U.S. telecom providers to prevent]{.underline} any
[espionage on **foreign 5G networks** from reaching into **domestic
networks**.]{.underline}

A quantum communications network like Quantum Xchange's Phio may just be
the answer to that challenge. Quantum Key Distribution
(**[QKD]{.underline}**) [offers unbreakable encryption of data which
will safeguard against]{.underline} the prospect of [quantum
technological power and its ability to **decrypt data**]{.underline};
[but it could also be applied to the **security threat** posed by Huawei
as 5G networks come online.]{.underline}

We certainly can't wait to find out what Huawei's intentions are. [The
**imperative to act now**]{.underline}, [to manage the risk now, is
**clear**]{.underline}.

# Case\-\--Military

## Mechanics

### Military\-\--2AC

#### NATO cybersecurity standards are [key]{.underline} to military 5G.

Piret **Pernik 21**, Researcher at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense
Centre for Excellence, Research Fellow at the Internal Centre for
Defence and Security; et al., 2021, "Research Report Supply Chain and
Network Security for Military 5G Networks,"
https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/research-report-supply-chain-and-network-security-for-military-5g-networks/,
RMax, MNOs = Mobile Network Operators

8\. Recommendations

8.1. Supply Chain Security

[**NATO** should set **trustworthiness criteria** for high-risk **5G**
equipment]{.underline} manufacturers and associated service providers
[with a view to **mitigating malicious intent**]{.underline} (such as
the insertion of vulnerabilities, interception, or disruptions of
supply). In cooperation with the EU, risk assessment and management
procedures and the baseline criteria for supply chain and network
security should be developed and implemented in cooperation with MNOs
(taking into account that untrusted elements also exist in trusted
networks). [Mitigating supply chain risks requires a close
public-private partnership of NATO, national governments, and
industry]{.underline}.

[**MNOs** should **share info**rmation with **governments** and **armed
forces** regarding **security controls** of **critical network
functions**]{.underline} (notably, pertaining to soft- and hardware,
systems, and products and services) [and provide information
on]{.underline} the security [vetting]{.underline} of [personnel who
have access to them]{.underline}.

8.2. Network Security

[**NATO nations** should **jointly** determine **appropriate network
security levels** and add-ons to]{.underline} commercial [**security
controls** for **military-grade networks**]{.underline} and associated
services. [NATO should determine common criteria for the certification
of products and services]{.underline}.

Further [research should be encouraged with regard to]{.underline}
technical **[network security]{.underline}** challenges, [including on
how to apply Zero Trust Security]{.underline} principles and respective
industry tools, [end-to-end encryption for military communications over
5G]{.underline} networks, [autonomy and automation for monitoring and
detection, and AI-enabled analytics and security]{.underline}.

8.3. Policies and Standards

[**NATO nations** should **harmonise national strategies** and policies
to secure]{.underline} commercial and [**military 5G networks**. NATO
should consider developing a strategy and/or roadmap for the development
of military 5G use cases, addressing]{.underline}, among other things,
[**interoperability** of equipment, services, and the radio frequency
spectrum]{.underline}. The [roadmap should identify the type of military
use cases deployed over commercial networks and deployment scenarios for
private (military/defence/NATO) 5G networks]{.underline}.

[NATO's standards development organisation should consider
how]{.underline} the [current 3GPP standards address]{.underline} the
[**security requirements** of the **military**. **NATO nations** should
certify products, processes, and services associated with 5G technology
according to jointly agreed criteria]{.underline}, taking into account
the existing certification schemes and assessing their value and
sufficiency. Nations should actively participate in standardisation
work.

[NATO nations should ensure]{.underline} the [**interoperability** of
national]{.underline} commercial and **[military 5G]{.underline}**
networks.

[NATO should]{.underline} consider [develop]{.underline}ing
[**Alliance-wide standards** for **resilient**, **reliable**,
**available** and **secure**]{.underline} civilian and [**military 5G
networks** and consider **military-grade standards**]{.underline} for
military networks.

8.4. Research, Education, and Training

Further research should explore the opportunities 5G technologies can
provide for improving Allied defence and deterrence and the security
risks inherent in these networks. Awareness raising concerning risks
associated with both public (commercial) and military 5G networks should
continue targeting specific training audiences (such as the general
public, parliaments, decision-makers in government and industry, and
military officers). [**NATO nations** should]{.underline} also
[commission studies to determine what]{.underline} competence and
[skills are needed in the armed forces and NATO to enable the deployment
of **military 5G networks** and **ensure** their
**security**]{.underline}.

Further research is needed into what use cases are feasible and less
risky from a security point of view. For example, integrating
mission-critical C2 with commercial 5G networks in an armed
conflict/combat scenario may be too risky, but the use of commercial 5G
networks for uses cases such as predictive maintenance, vehicle
platooning, or AR/VR training might be feasible.

[NATO nations should invest into network security **testing
laboratories**]{.underline} (such as Estonia's Cyber Range CR14 5G SA
test bed) and encourage cooperation between test beds.

NATO should commission research on practical ways and means to enhance
nations' participation in global standardisation work.

O-RAN should be studied in terms of opportunities to increase security,
the interoperability of products, and market diversity, as well as to
assess risks emerging from open source technology. O-RAN standards
should follow the industry best practices. This research should
recommend ways and means to mitigate O-RAN risks.

Further research is also needed on how to establish a 34 NATO-owned and
-accredited virtual MNO and e-SIM that NATO nations could use.

8.5. Partnerships

[NATO nations should enhance **timely info**rmation and
**best-practices-sharing**, including **risk assessments**,
concerning]{.underline} commercial and **[military 5G]{.underline}**
networks. To this end, [nations should establish points of
**contact**]{.underline} [and create subject-matter-**expert networks**
in relevant government and **armed forces organisations**]{.underline}.
Similar networks of experts should be created with the participation of
universities, research institutions, and industry.

Governments and [**armed forces** should have sufficient visibility of
supply chain and network security]{.underline} processes, procedures,
and practices [used by manufacturers of 5G]{.underline} technology [and
providers of associated services]{.underline} (such as MNOs and cloud
service providers). [**Armed forces** should establish **partnerships**
with commercial service providers and equipment manufacturers that
**enable** them to assess risks and assure the **integrity**,
**security**, **resilience**, **privacy**, and quality of
the]{.underline} acquired [products]{.underline}, systems, and services
throughout their life cycle. 5G network service providers should be
encouraged to cooperate with armed forces to access the security
controls of RAN, MEC, core network, and other critical functions. MNOs
should share confidential information with armed forces on issues such
as their 5G risk assessments, security policies and controls, and
certification of their network components.

NATO and the EU should set up a regular informal consultation body to
jointly assess risks and develop mitigation measures across strategic,
technical, and supportive dimensions, building on the EU's experience
with risk assessments and the Toolbox.

Technology can be neutral and value-agnostic in principle, but it rarely
is in practice. [NATO should **counterbalance** China's ambitions to
attain **global dominance** in **key EDT** by developing]{.underline}
like-minded [technologies that are **trusted**, **secure**,
**reliable**, **available** and **resilient**. NATO should support the
adoption of this **trusted technology** globally]{.underline}, while
refraining from using authoritarian opponents' technology that is
commonly used undermine democratic values and freedoms.

#### Cybersecurity is key to military 5G.

Robert **Spalding 21**, former Senior Director of Strategy to the
President at the National Security Council, founder and CEO of SEMPRE,

warfighter,\"

RMax

The [deployment of 5G]{.underline} networks [by the U.S. military will
be]{.underline} an **[historic]{.underline}** moment [for today's
warfighter. From improved **C5ISR**]{.underline} \[command, control,
computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance\] [**readiness** and **geolocation accuracy** to **more
effective** enemy engagement and **perimeter defense**, 5G gear will
enable **scalable**, extremely **low-latency**, mobile **radio
platforms** and an Internet of Things **edge-sensor network** that puts
the power of real-time AI and machine learning into the hands of the
**combat soldier**. This future state is **achievable**, but not without
confronting a **blunt reality**: 5G is an **open architecture** designed
for commercial applications and]{.underline} as such [suffers from a
great many **security vulnerabilities**. To build a **resilient**,
**secure**, survivable **5G military communications network**, we must
**first harden** and **future-proof** the COTS \[commercial
off-the-shelf\]-based hardware, software, and firmware that are the
foundation of today's civilian 5G infrastructure]{.underline}.

As commercial 5G service rolls out across the U.S. with the promise of
100 times greater speeds than its 4G predecessor, [it's **time** to
examine how the **U.S. military** can equip the modern warfighter
with]{.underline} an upgrade to [today's]{.underline} outmoded
[battlefield communications infrastructure]{.underline}.

This is no small feat. 5G was designed by an international coalition of
technology companies, with heavy input from state-owned Chinese firms.
[As an **open-source**]{.underline}, commercial standard, [5G is
**riddled** with]{.underline} potential **[security
threats]{.underline}**, nearly 800 of which have yet to be resolved by
the governing 3GPP standards body. Moreover, [the uptake of **5G** by
the **warfighter** will **require** the U.S. military to forego a
decades-long practice of developing bespoke, incompatible radio hardware
and move toward a **shared**, **hardened communications
framework**.]{.underline}

Communications alignment is a national security imperative

The good news? The overhaul and unification of the military's
communications network is already underway in key areas.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is committed to its Joint
All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) mission, which according to the
Congressional Research Service (CRS), aims to "connect sensors from all
military services -- Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space
Force -- into a single network." This alone will accelerate the speed of
decision-making for the soldier and command-and-control (C2) center,
which is an urgently needed component of the U.S.'s National Defense
Strategy as it prepares for the emergence of Mach 5+ hypersonic weapons.

The U.S. Air Force is contributing to the JADC2 mission by developing
the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a C2 framework that the
CRS describes as "using secure cloud environments and new communications
methods to allow Air Force and Space Force systems to share data
seamlessly using artificial intelligence." In effect, this is an attempt
at integrating a sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) network that
reinvents the conventional, airborne C2 structure by extending the eyes
and ears of our warfighters to an intelligent edge.

Just as importantly, [a **unified communications topology** must support
the nation's **Nuclear C**ommand and **C**ontrol System (NCCS), which
**guides** the chain of command in providing the President with
information required to authorize (and prevent
unauthorized)]{.underline} use of **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.

Allure of 5G processing speeds tempered by inherent security risks

The military has long been eager to build a common telecommunications
and computing platform that enables new software applications to be
adopted at the same speed as the commercial sector -- or better yet,
harden Android and Apple iOS smartphones for use in the field. [At
best]{.underline}, however, [today's warfighter is relegated to using
the phone's GPS]{.underline} map function for geolocation, [which
is]{.underline} often [more reliable than their military-issued
gear]{.underline}.

[5G is the **enabling tech**nology that will **underpin** the military's
**digital transformation**, but 5G was **never** designed as a native
military radio waveform. This]{.underline} reality presents significant
challenges and entails the recognition that more than 60% of what the
3GPP ratified as 4G and 5G standards were developed primarily by
state-owned Chinese companies. That raises concerns relative to the
influence China may have exercised over an industry standards-making
body -- and the number of unsecured backdoors and man-in-the-middle
vulnerabilities through which classified data can be siphoned or
modified.

As a point of reference, [a]{.underline} 2019 [report released by IoT
cybersecurity specialist, Finite State]{.underline}, looked into Huawei
Technologies and [found]{.underline} that [**55 percent**
of]{.underline} tested [Huawei devices had at least one potential
**backdoor**]{.underline}. In its summary of findings, Finite State
concluded that "[if you include known, remote access vulnerabilities
along with possible back doors, Huawei devices appear to be at **high
risk** of]{.underline} potential **[compromise]{.underline}**."

What a 5G future will look like for the warfighter

[The future 5G state]{.underline} we should be working to realize [will
enable users to harness the power]{.underline} of AI, machine learning,
and hundreds of thousands of sensors at the IoT edge. [Doing so will
give troops **real-time intelligence** and **processing** while
providing **secure battlefield computing** and
**communications**]{.underline} using fixed and transportable cellular
towers supplemented by vehicle-mounted data center nodes. [All of this
can be achieved using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)]{.underline}
hardware, software, and firmware, [as long as it's]{.underline} all
[**sufficiently hardened** to ensure a **secure connection** to both the
network and computing platform]{.underline}.

So, practically speaking, what would a typical 5G application look like?
Let's consider base security: [A lot of what occurs on the battlefield
involves]{.underline} establishing and maintaining [a **security
perimeter**]{.underline}. We can surmise that [5G-enabled communications
technology will enable]{.underline} easy supplementation of the
perimeter with [**field-of-motion** and **pressure
sensors**]{.underline}. When activated, those [sensors feed
into]{.underline} a [**tower-based** alert system that sends out
**drones** to investigate]{.underline}. The [drones leverage video
streaming and facial recognition, and]{.underline} if a threat is
detected, [can trigger an automated targeting system. If deployed
properly, 5G will enable users to very quickly **automate**]{.underline}
their [field operations]{.underline}.

Marry the cell tower and data center node

In a commercial 5G application, a smartphone streaming data sends a
signal to a nearby tower, which routes the request to a data center that
may be hundreds of miles away. The data is retrieved and sent back
through the tower and on to the user. That's a large threat surface, as
was seen with the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware cyberattack.

A more secure, resilient solution is to co-locate the cell tower and
data center and build hundreds of them as part of a distributed,
compartmentalized network. Not only does this provide better, more even
coverage, but if one tower is compromised the others will continue to
send and receive data. In turn, that data is wrapped in purpose-built
security layers from the inside out -- not as a programming afterthought
-- and provides the warfighter with a "zero-trust network" that includes
encryption, user authentication, sandboxing, behavioral analytics, and
other protective measures.

It's this concept that led to the development of [the SEMPRE
Tower]{.underline}, which is based on the idea that a hardened,
COTS-based 5G telecommunications and computing infrastructure [can be
adapted by the military to **improve collaboration** on the battlefield
while maintaining a **secure**, **resilient** C5ISR
\[]{.underline}command, control, computers, communications, cyber,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance\] [framework that can
**withstand** a **nuclear** electromagnetic pulse **(EMP)
attack**]{.underline}. (Figure 1.)

\[Figure 1 omitted\]

SEMPRE Towers are currently undergoing advanced field trials with the
DoD, Air Force, and Army. As the trials progress, the goal is to
reimagine battlefield communications by equipping the war­fighter with a
data gateway -- and a data sentry -- that securely and seamlessly
connects them across different military branches with the performance,
flexibility, and ease-of-use of a commercial smartphone.

[The North Atlantic Council]{.underline} (**[NAC]{.underline}**)

of the [Alliance are **complex**, **destructive**, **coercive**, and
becoming ever **more frequent**]{.underline}.'102 The council affirmed
determination 'to employ the full range of capabilities, as applicable,
at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full
spectrum of cyber threats, in accordance with international law.'103
[Telecommunications, including **5G networks**, are also **susceptible**
to cyber threats]{.underline}. This section outlines the supply chain
and network security risks related to 5G technology and systems.

[The armed forces of NATO **nations** and NATO **command structure**
need to take into account **vulnerabilities**, **threats** and **risks**
related to both public and private 5G networks]{.underline}. Three 5G
network deployment models for military use identified in this report
come with their own security challenges, which should be understood and
assessed.104 While the Research Report focuses on military use cases, it
cannot disregard the vulnerabilities, threats and risks associated with
commercial 5G networks, because [in practice, the military will largely
use **networks** and **equipment** available commercially. Almost all
telecommunication technologies are for dual]{.underline} (i.e. military
and civilian) [use, and **inevitably**, there will be
**interdependencies**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} hence,
[vulnerabilities]{.underline}) [across the whole life cycle involving
many stakeholders]{.underline} (including third-party suppliers and
service providers, such as private companies that own and operate mobile
cell towers). Therefore, [visibility into the supply chain ecosystem is
essential]{.underline} for the military.

The security of 5G networks is a very broad and complex topic, and
research on it continues to evolve. Many white papers, research reports,
overviews and other studies have been published in this area in the last
decade. Several distinct threat taxonomies and categorisations of
non-technical and technical 5G security risks have been developed by
international and governmental organisations, equipment vendors and
technical security researchers. A choice of a specific methodology to
assess risks depends on a particular target audience -- for example,
reports addressed to telecommunication sector experts offer a very
detailed description of technical security risks associated to
infrastructure, components and interfaces of 5G architecture. In
addition, the academic and think-tank literature includes a large body
of writings offering overviews for policy-makers and regulators who lack
technical knowledge of telecommunications.

In addition to supply chain challenges (including the trustworthiness
criteria of vendors) and network security challenges, physical security
and electromagnetic inference threats to military use cases must be
considered, along with traditional insider threats.105 In case of the
deployment of the military 5G network on an expeditionary operation in
an armed conflict, electromagnetic interference attacks are likely to
impede network connectivity and system capacity. However, those attacks
have also been launched in peacetime. 5G networks used for expeditionary
operations in high-intensity kinetic conflict must meet the most
stringent military security requirements in the areas of resistance to
jamming, network resilience, and security.

[The armed forces **must assume** that 5G network infrastructure is
**vulnerable to cyberattacks** from both **encryption** and
**resiliency** standpoints. The military must be able to **operate**
over **untrusted networks**]{.underline} or networks, including some
untrusted components or insecure interfaces.106 [This could mean that
the military cannot **transfer** and **store** classified data in some
5G networks]{.underline}, even though pilot projects for classified
information exist[. Needless to say, the fact that a given equipment
manufacturer, MNO, or third-party service provider is geographically
located in the jurisdiction of an EU or NATO nation does not guarantee
that **infrastructure**, **equipment**, or **services** provided by
these stakeholders are secure. Even **trusted networks** with recognised
**security maturity** can be accessed physically, by **malicious
insiders**]{.underline} (such as MNO employees), [and through
**electromagnetic** and **cyberattack**]{.underline} means. In such
cases, the [NATO nations']{.underline} armed forces [need to consider
what types of **information** and **military functions** can be
transmitted and stored in **public** and **hybrid** 5G
networks]{.underline}.

Why it matters?

Four main reasons related to telecommunications underlie the increased
attention to 5G. First, telecommunications are broadly speaking an
enabling technology, which can drive economic growth across the entire
economy. Forecasting models predict for example that [5G networks will
add trillions of dollars of economic value to the international
economy]{.underline}. Just as 4G unleashed a major wave of technological
transformation -- from the iPhone and Google.maps to Instagram and
Whatsapp via Uber and Snapchat -- 5G networks are expected to deliver
similar effects. Second, telecommunications are generally dominated by a
first-mover advantage: early entrants can accrue enormous economic
value, leaving little room for competitors. Actors -- from companies to
countries -- thus have a strong incentive to consolidate their position
and maximize economic returns. Third, telecommunications carry a
strategic dimension: the speed, quality and quantity of information are
crucial for competing in the digital world. Finally, given the
centrality information plays in modern economies, telecommunications are
widely, and rightly, considered a strategic industry. Companies transfer
private, and often sensitive information. [**Governments share** diverse
types of **data**, including classified material.]{.underline}

5G and China

Another important reason that [5G has attracted particular
attention]{.underline} is that the leading players in this technology
are not Western, Japanese or South Korean companies but rather
[China-based companies like **Huawei**]{.underline} and ZTE. Several
factors explain the rise of Chinese operators in this domain. One is the
expertise and experience they acquired with their failed bid to enter
the 3G competition over a decade ago. Following this, the Chinese
government launched major public investments in this area and developed
a coherent strategy, while private companies conducted research and
patented their seminal technologies. [Chinese companies also enjoy a
competitive advantage, especially when approaching foreign markets on
5G: at home, they can count on a widespread availability of fibre, large
deployments of small cells,]{.underline} a higher availability of
spectrum in low-frequency bands and the maturity of 4G, as well as an
enormous domestic market and low production costs. Chinese, Japanese and
South Korean companies have long played an important role in
telecommunications markets around the world. In fact, Huawei and ZTE
from China as well as Nec (Japan) or Samsung (South Korea) are key
suppliers in current 4G networks. However, the role of Chinese companies
in 5G communications has a very different connotation. With 5G --
involving massive machine-to-machine communications -- perimeter cyber
defence will no longer be effective as it will be impossible to grant
access exclusively to authorised devices. As a result, the risk and
potential severity of attacks grow exponentially. Also, the more
important role of software in network virtualisation will grant
equipment integrators (i.e. potentially Chinese companies) wider and
deeper access into network operations (i.e. data), thus raising serious
questions about trust and reliability. In other words, changes in
technology have severe political implications, especially because
[Chinese companies have **direct political connections** to their
government,]{.underline} [including to the **intelligence
community**.]{.underline} China's internal big data policy -- based on
massive surveillance and limited privacy -- is at odds with other
countries' systems of values, ethics and law. And finally, [Chinese
companies]{.underline} have in recent years repeatedly been accused of
[stealing intellectual property and using **cyber-espionage** to access
proprietary information.]{.underline} Tests on [Chinese electronic
devices have often also revealed security vulnerabilities, including
**backdoors** that can lead to the direct **transfer** of **data to
China.**]{.underline}

NATO Allies and 5G

Until last December, NATO had taken no stand on 5G communications. Even
after the London Leaders Meeting, no single policy or position has truly
emerged. Looking at the Allies' response, we can identify five main
groups: the concerned, the lawmakers, the undecided, the sceptics and
the early adopters.

The concerned

T[o date, the United States is the only NATO country that has taken
effective steps to restrict access to its 5G network from Chinese
companies like Huawei]{.underline} or ZTE. Importantly, however, the US
administration's ban announced in May 2019 has not yet entered into
force due to 90-day extensions that have been renewed four times.
Congress has passed some bills with **[wide bipartisan
consensus]{.underline}** -- such as the so-called "rip and replace act"
(signed into law by President Trump in March 2020) -- which compel
Huawei and other Chinese companies to stick to stricter security
controls or, in other cases, support Western companies in the 5G
competition. Along the same lines, in May 2020, the U.S. Department of
Commerce announced an amendment to its Entity List, subjecting Huawei to
individual licensing requirements for exports. By [targeting Huawei's
acquisition of semiconductors]{.underline}, the decision aims to curtail
severely the company's competitiveness. [Huawei]{.underline} eventually
[confirmed]{.underline} [that such an amendment would put its very
survival at stake.]{.underline} Similarly, the U.S. Department of State
launched the "5G Clean networks", a plan for setting a "clean path" for
allies of the United States to exclude Chinese vendors from their
networks.

The lawmakers

[Some Allies, such as Italy, have not placed a ban on Chinese 5G
equipment manufacturers]{.underline} but have already committed to
stricter regulations[.]{.underline} In late 2019, the Italian government
approved a law establishing a "National Cyber-Security Perimeter" which
in turn introduced more stringent rules and procedures to assess the
security of 5G equipment. Germany fits into the same category. Despite a
passionate internal debate, the Federal Government is not expected to
ban Chinese companies from its 5G network. Deutsche Telekom has already
announced that it will continue working with Chinese 5G providers.

The undecided

The positions of some NATO countries have evolved over time,
progressively adopting a stricter stance. The Czech Republic signed a
joint declaration with the United States on 5G security on 6 May 2020,
stating the intent "to strengthen our cooperation on 5G" and determine
whether the network is "subject, without independent judicial review, to
undue foreign influence". Similarly, after an initial assessment phase
in January 2020, the Greek government slowed the deployment of 5G
infrastructure owing to "national security and protection of the
country's critical infrastructure". The United Kingdom is another
example. Initially, in January 2020, the British government announced a
35 per cent cap on Huawei's participation in the "non-core part" of the
5G network, while barring it altogether from the "core part". Later, in
May 2020, Downing Street adopted a different position, proposing a "5G
Club" of 10 democracies (the G7 countries along with Australia, India
and South Korea) to create alternative suppliers of 5G equipment and
other technologies to avoid relying on China.

The sceptics

[The vast majority of Allies have not barred or limited the role of
Chinese companies in their 5G infrastructure]{.underline}. In France,
for instance, Orange and Vodafone already chose Ericsson (Sweden) and
Nokia (Finland) for their 5G networks. Nonetheless, both the government
and the intelligence community have signaled that they do not see any
valid reason to exclude other foreign providers. Similarly, the Belgian
government announced it would impose constraints only on "unreliable
suppliers". [Other Allies, such as Canada, have so far taken no decision
on Chinese companies.]{.underline}

The early adopter

Finally, another group of countries have already adopted Chinese 5G
technology and -- given the high replacement costs of the infrastructure
-- are unlikely to backtrack. Within NATO, these are Hungary and Spain.
However, several early adopters, although not NATO countries, are
important for the Alliance or some of its Allies. In Europe, these
include Ireland, an EU member, and Serbia, a potential future EU member,
and Switzerland. Among Gulf States, other examples are Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which to different
degrees host military bases or personnel of different NATO Allies. In
Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines are among the countries to have
adopted Huawei's 5G technology.

Where next?

The discussion on 5G will continue in the months and years ahead, and
the issue is likely to acquire further salience as [**military
communications** start to transition to 5G]{.underline}. In the future,
**[for NATO]{.underline}** in particular, [it will be of **central
importance** to exploit these new technological opportunities for
command and control, communications, as well as for other purposes.
Without 5G communications, it will be difficult to fully exploit big
data, **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence and cloud computing on the
battlefield.]{.underline}

#### 5G cybersecurity is key.

However, [the Department of Defense must guarantee that the 5G
revolution is **as safe as possible**]{.underline}. With the confluence
of all of these technologies and services, [troops and commanders will
have access to a **vast quantity of data** and **situational
awareness**. With so many people relying on a network for critical
mission execution, the Department of Defense **must
ensure**]{.underline} that [it is safe from **start** to **finish**,
that it can **withstand** current **cyber-attacks**, and that it can
**self-heal**.]{.underline}

The Department of Defense has a long history of fostering innovation by
sponsoring innovative technology ventures and pushing the boundaries.
With 5G now available and a slew of commercial technologies converging,
we\'ll be able to take advantage of the next big communications
revolution while also ensuring its security, resulting in companies
clamoring for solutions based on DoD-funded research.
[Let\'s]{.underline} simply [put security **front and center**, and make
sure it\'s **as high a priority** as **deployment speed**.]{.underline}

[Much attention is focused, and **appropriately** so, on the **security
risks** associated with 5G]{.underline} -- particularly those
technologies [produced in China]{.underline}. But [next-generation
wireless tech]{.underline}nologies [promise a **revolution** in
**military operations**, one that will change **everything** from
training to logistics to]{.underline} the [tactical, operational, and
strategic dimensions of warfare. As the institution **responsible** for
enabling **effective joint and combined operations**]{.underline} by its
member states, [**NATO must help lead** the **integration of 5G** into
the force structures and operations of the alliance and among **allied
armed forces**]{.underline}.

[Next-gen wireless communications are a **game changer**]{.underline}
because [lower network latency and leap in throughput speeds translates
into **massive real-time data sharing**]{.underline}, and because [low
power consumption will shrink the size]{.underline} and weight
[of]{.underline} the [electronic systems that burden combat
**aircraft**, **warships**, and **individual troops**]{.underline}. 

[**5G** will bring to the battlefield **new ways** to share and
integrate **sensor data** between operators, weapons, and platforms,
including unmanned systems. It will enable forces to harness
**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and
**m**]{.underline}achine **[l]{.underline}**earning [in ways never
before seen on a battlefield: autonomous loading]{.underline} and
off-loading of trucks, trains, planes and ships; **[enhanced situational
awareness]{.underline}** for soldiers in the foxhole and their most
senior commanders; [**real-time targeting and retargeting**; and, new
military concepts]{.underline} of operations, [such as]{.underline} the
[swarming of **drones**]{.underline}.

Imagine [a very high-speed, low-latency secure wireless bubble across a
battlefield]{.underline} or all of Europe. Built correctly, this [would
be the **digital backbone**]{.underline} [of a **better NATO defense**
and **deterrence** posture]{.underline}. 

But along with the opportunities, 5G poses profound challenges for the
alliance. [If left **uncoordinated**, allies risk deploying
5G]{.underline} technologies [that strip their forces of
**interoperability** and render them vulnerable to **penetration** and
compromise by our adversaries. **NATO needs a 5G strategy**
to]{.underline} mitigate, if not [**eliminate**, those **risks** and
position allied forces on the **technological high ground** of the
battlefields]{.underline} of [today and tomorrow]{.underline}.

#### 5G risks compromising military information\-\--mimicking the chain of command wrecks military communications.

[In the **military realm**, deepfake technology could **disrupt**
effective military communication]{.underline} by producing false but
convincing [signal chatter]{.underline} on a massive scale or [mimicking
key individuals in the chain of command]{.underline} giving voice
orders.54 Also consider the implications of high-quality insurgent
propaganda video for asymmetric warfare. [Creating policies to address
this security risk is **key for NATO** and its allies, as it moves
forward in the realm of cyber defense]{.underline}.

Deepfakes make it possible for [malign actors to deny the truth in two
ways]{.underline}: not only may fake videos be passed off as real to
create doubt, but [authentic information can be passed off as
fake]{.underline}.55 This happened in 2018 in Gabon, when [opponents of
president Ali Bongo]{.underline}, who had not been seen in public for
months, [claimed that a video of him produced by the administration was
fake]{.underline}, suggesting instead that he was incapacitated or dead.
[This speculation spread and the military attempted a **coup** a week
later]{.underline}.56

Despite these potential dangers, a recent primer on deepfakes, published
by the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence in Riga,
concluded that while the threat from deepfakes is real, it is only one
tool among many in the hands of malign actors. The risk posed by
deepfakes is narrower than commonly suggested and may distract from
[other deployments of machine learning by disinformation
perpetrators]{.underline} that may be as, if not more, impactful than
deepfakes.57

Cyber (in)security

[5G is generally considered more secure]{.underline} than previous
networks (2G, 3G, 4G LTE) [due to better encryption]{.underline} 58 and
the ability for network slicing, which makes potential breaches less
likely and less damaging.59 Since 5G is an evolution of 4G LTE,
developers of this technology have been able to [deal with weaknesses
and vulnerabilities in previous networks and build security improvements
into the protocol to ensure that 5G is more secure.]{.underline}
However, that potential for extra security may not be delivered by the
service providers for cost reasons. Despite increasing risk, [not all
manufacturers prioritize cybersecurity]{.underline}. Perhaps the
greatest risk concerns extension of the attack surface. As connected
[devices **proliferate** in **a 5G environment**, the threat potential
as well as new points of attack increase.]{.underline} Put simply, [any
system is only as strong as its weakest link]{.underline}: billions of
interconnected devices with varied security also mean billions of
possible breach points.60 [Given 5G's edge computing potential, this is
a **concern** for the creators of 5G **infrastructure** and networks
across Europe.]{.underline}

[Most of the attention]{.underline} surrounding the cybersecurity of 5G
networks has [focused on supply chain challenges. Chinese companies
currently lead in 5G development and Huawei dominates the global
market]{.underline} for telecommunications equipment. In 2019[,
twothirds of 5G networks outside China relied on telecom equipment
manufactured in China]{.underline}.61 On top of reported security
vulnerabilities -- such as software code deficiencies or poor oversight
of its supplier networks -- which [could be exploited by any malign
actor, concerns have also been voiced about Huawei's ties to the Chinese
government and the potential risk that China might use 5G infrastructure
for **espionage** or illicit actions]{.underline} (such as intellectual
property theft, company sabotage, or fraud).62 The Chinese State
Security Law [obliges companies to 'provide assistance with work related
to state security']{.underline}.[63 If critical communications,
including Internet voting, come to depend on 5G networks, this will
create a level of insecurity]{.underline} since the Chinese regime might
gain access to and eventually manipulate such processes.64 [The ability
to manipulate public opinion, with implications for
democracy,]{.underline} is certainly there, just like it was with 4G.
With 5G, however, [the lack of trust in its architecture, alongside
uncertainties about how the infrastructure operates, heightens some of
those concerns.]{.underline}

In addition to user profiling and political microtargeting, with the
roll-out of 5G, [an increase in the volume and speed of data theft is
expected.65]{.underline} As confirmed by the US Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), 5G networks will constitute '[an
**attractive target** for criminals and foreign adversaries to exploit
for valuable information and intelligence'.]{.underline}66

Just as **[5G]{.underline}** networks' data capacity will enable a vast
array of commercial and civilian applications, so too [will]{.underline}
it [**open the door** for **enhanced military
capabilities**]{.underline}. As described by the Defense Innovation
Board (DIB), a federal advisory committee established to provide
independent advice to the Secretary of Defense:

[5G has the capability to combine DoD's]{.underline} current
[**fragmented networks** into a **single network** to promote improved
**situational awareness** and **decision-making**. This expanded reach
will enable new technologies like **hypersonic weapons** and
**hypersonic defenses** to be deployed, and has the potential to
**strengthen**]{.underline} existing missions like **[nuclear
C3]{.underline}**. At an enterprise level, [5G can vastly
improve]{.underline} day-to-day tasks such as [**logistics** and
**maintenance**, elevating the efficiency and speed of work across
DoD]{.underline}.21

[U.S. national security requires]{.underline} that such **[military
communications]{.underline}** -- as well as communications relating to
diplomatic, intelligence, law-enforcement, peacekeeping, and
humanitarian activities around the globe, some of them integrated [with
**allies**]{.underline} or coalition partners -- [be **secure** and
**reliable**. These activities frequently rely on the **global ICT
infrastructure**, as well as the infrastructures of our allies and
partners, for all or part of their communications. The potential
penetration by China of these infrastructures creates **significant
risks** to **U.S. mobilization**, **sustainment**, and **mission
continuity**. The use of Chinese equipment]{.underline} in developing
countries' telecommunications networks [will create a global operational
environment in which the U.S. forces may be compelled to operate on
systems subject to **hostile influence** or **control**]{.underline}.22
Even though U.S. forces often deploy with U.S.-origin computing and
communications systems that can operate independent of indigenous
infrastructure, [**secure 5G technology** can **enhance deployed

WASHINGTON: Today, after multiple delays and months of negotiations with
the airline industry, [Verizon and AT&T]{.underline} will [begin rolling
out 5G nationwide]{.underline}, in a move [the]{.underline} commercial
[aviation community says will have dire safety
implications]{.underline}.

Airline executives warned in a Jan. 18 letter that, [without
safeguards]{.underline} in place around airports and runways, [the
rollout could cause "catastrophic disruption" and "**economic
calamity**."]{.underline} Despite an agreement by Verizon and AT&T on
late Tuesday to limit 5G services around major airports to prevent
interference, some international airlines such as Emirates and Lufthansa
canceled flights to the United States due to concerns about potential
effects on the Boeing 777.

But for a controversy that's dominated headlines and reached the desk of
the president, [the Pentagon]{.underline} --- the largest aircraft fleet
owner in the world --- has remained largely silent. That's because right
now, it [**doesn't know** how 5G will affect **military
aircraft**]{.underline}.

All told, it will be at least a year and a half after the Federal
Communications Commission began selling spectrum for 5G before the
Defense Department weighs in on the issue, and it could take months
after that for the department to come up with a plan to resolve any
technical failures that occur as military pilots continue flying in
areas where the 5G deployment is occurring.

[The overarching problem shared by both the military and civil aviation
revolves around **radar altimeters**, a piece of hardware used by
**airplanes**, **rotorcraft** and even]{.underline} some [**drones** to
measure the height of an aircraft from the ground]{.underline}.

In the United States, [5G will reside on a neighboring portion of the
C-band spectrum to radar altimeters]{.underline}. Some **[aviation
experts]{.underline}** and government officials [are **concerned** that
the resulting interference could **prevent aircraft** from being able to
make landings in bad weather]{.underline} --- [or worse]{.underline},
that [pilots may not]{.underline} truly [understand an aircraft's
distance from the ground, **increasing** the **risk of a
crash**]{.underline}.

"The DoD continues to work very closely with our FAA counterparts on
this issue. All DoD Services issued bulletins to the field/fleet, making
aircrews aware of the potential for interference and establishing a
mechanism to report instances of interference," said Lt. Col. Dylan
McDermott, the Pentagon's point person on this issue in his role as head
of the Aviation Cyber Initiative, co-chaired with the FAA and Department
of Homeland Security.

While military pilots will be advised of the potential issue, [the
department has **not** issued any **NOTAMS** --- a "notice to air
missions" that spells out **hazards** and or other **abnormalities** in
the air --- for **any** of the **military bases** in 5G]{.underline}
deployment [areas]{.underline}, McDermott said in a Jan. 18 statement to
Breaking Defense.

#### DoD is not aware of 5G security threats to airpower in the status quo.

WASHINGTON --- [As]{.underline} the commercial airline and
telecommunications [industries scramble to limit]{.underline} the
potential [safety risks to aircraft from a rollout of new 5G networks,
it may be months before the **U.S. military** has a handle
on]{.underline} whether, or [how big, of a problem this might be for
**its own planes**]{.underline}.

[At the center]{.underline} of the controversy [is whether the
deployment of 5G]{.underline} networks, operating along a frequency
known as the C-band, [will **interfere** with radar altimeters used by
**military**]{.underline}, civilian and commercial [**aircraft** and
**helicopters**. These **altimeters** are used to measure the distance
between the aircraft and the ground]{.underline}.

[For the military, they are]{.underline} particularly [**necessary**
when **mobility aircraft** such as cargo planes or tankers land in
**adverse weather** conditions. If the pilot's visibility is
poor]{.underline} during such a landing, [he or she would have to use
altimeters to measure how far off the ground the aircraft
is]{.underline} during the approach, [and a flawed reading could lead to
a crash.]{.underline}

Verizon and AT&T began activating their [5G networks]{.underline} on
Wednesday, [promising]{.underline} much [**faster wireless service
speeds** than]{.underline} the previous [4G network]{.underline}. But
amid a growing outcry from the commercial airline industry, the
companies on Tuesday announced they would temporarily limit the
deployment of new 5G networks near some airports. Some international
airlines announced plans to cancel certain flights to the United States
over the concern.

5\. Military Movement Related Cybersecurity Risks and Mitigation

5.1 Risks Associated with Military Movement Scenarios

In this section of the report, the aim is to give a systematic and
high-level security analysis of the use cases given in the previous
sections. Threat modelling approaches suit this purpose as they are
utilised for comprehending possible threats at the initial stages of
development life cycles, even though they can also be helpful in later
phases or hypothetical use cases. More specifically, the STRIDE (a
mnemonic for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure,
Denial of service and Elevation of privilege) approach applied to many
software developments projects 44 and adopted into complex
cyber-physical systems in numerous studies is used. 45 The risks listed
below were identified by this method, however, the specific approach is
not described to ensure the simplicity of the document.

Both [**seaports** and **road transportation**]{.underline} solutions
[are part of the **critical infrastructure** for **logistics**
and]{.underline} need to [have high demands on **data security** for
**functional safety** and **reliable connectivity**. The exchanged data
and information can be considered as **sensitive assets** that need to
be **protected** from **cyberattacks** and enemy exploitation.
Both]{.underline} the [smart seaport and smart road transportation
assets with a **risk exposure** to **cyberattacks**
include]{.underline}:

- **[information assets]{.underline}**: data in transit, user data,
  control signalling, network management data, and data stored in data
  centres;

- **[infrastructure assets]{.underline}**: systems, hardware, platforms,
  and applications.

- Threat [actors include organised cybercriminals, nation states,
  hacktivists, terrorists, and insiders]{.underline}. These attackers
  are generally motivated by three main factors: money by ransom
  blackmail, stealing of business sensitive information and data, and
  finally sabotage. Exploited security weaknesses are:

- [improperly designed IT security policy that is]{.underline} also
  **[not enforced]{.underline}**, monitored or constantly tested;

- [**lack of hardening** and **insecure configuration** of the
  **network**]{.underline};

- [operational procedures]{.underline};

- [lack of visibility, control, and monitoring]{.underline}.

Figure 9 shows the [attack surfaces on network
infrastructure]{.underline} that [can be **exploited** by a
**cyberattacker**. Cyberattacks can have **severe implications** on
**smart transportation infrastructure** and use cases with high cost for
protection and mitigation]{.underline}, and unknown losses due to stolen
property (data) and losses in productivity. The impacts of
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** in severe conditions [could be
**devastating** for **logistics** and **transport solutions** vital
for]{.underline} the **[military movement]{.underline}**.

\[Figure 9 omitted\]

In addition to general 5G network-related risks, [there exist a
**multitude** of]{.underline} different [types of **risks** related to
5G Core]{.underline}, RAN, cloud services and even from an operational
security perspective, as shown in Figure 10. For example, [**attacks**
against 5G RAN via jamming operational systems could cause **convoys**
and **port machinery** to **halt operations** and cause **system
shutdowns**]{.underline}; and [**malicious interception** can reveal
information about **military unit locations**, their **composition**,
and **route**]{.underline}. It is therefore important to stress the fact
that UE networking and MEC related threats, that are the key element of
this research report, are not the only risks and threats but are
analysed to the extent of the report's scope as the military
transportation related use cases will be based on multi-access edge
computing.

\[Figure 10 omitted\]

5.2 Multi-Access Edge Computing Related Cybersecurity Risks

According to the network architecture and the use case specificity, both
[the **smart seaport** and **smart road transportation**]{.underline}
use cases [will rely on **m**ultiaccess **e**dge **c**omputing
technology due to]{.underline} the [demand for]{.underline} reliable
[**low-latency data exchange** and **extensive processing**. For smart
road transportation, there is evident need for]{.underline} ProSe
[**device-to-device communication** relying]{.underline} on a PC5 link
channel. [When relying on MEC technology, a variety of risks in addition
to generic **5G network-related risks** need to be taken into account to
ensure a **high level of security**]{.underline}. As for the MEC
technology, the computational part, i.e. real-time safety camera stream
processing, will move closer to the user and occur at the edge of the
network, and third-party attacks and threats can be directly linked to
the vehicles and equipment that are used for the transportation of
military assets. Therefore, [at every stage of the value chain, certain
types of risks that can harm both the systems, monitor the movement, or
even damage the assets, need to be evaluated]{.underline}. Below is a
list of detailed vulnerabilities relevant to MEC. 46

- Improper mechanisms for monitoring, collecting, and storing secure
  data and transmitting data between devices, which lead to unauthorised
  access to data and potential fraud committed by the attackers.

- Improper access control to information, where the MEC platform should
  only provide the mobile edge application with authorised information.
  If the platform is not secured properly, unauthorised parties can
  access secure data and confidential information.

- Lack of or improperly implemented DDoS protection. Due to the
  distributed nature of edge computing deployments, appropriate DdoS
  mechanisms may be impractical to deploy. Alternative protection
  mechanisms, therefore, need to be implemented to deter attacks. In the
  case of a DdoS attack, the attacker can shut down the whole system and
  halt or alter the convoys transporting the military assets.

- Improper isolation of resources whereby both physical and logical
  resources should not be shared with other parties/components which
  have different level of criticality. This means there should be a
  different level of criticality and security for military-related
  activities in transportation cases, otherwise there is a high risk of
  unauthorised access, interception, and eavesdropping by attackers.

- Improper physical and environmental security of edge computing
  facilities. Edge computing facilities are, by their nature, seated in
  locations distributed geographically. Normally, the first choice will
  be communications shelters already operated by the MNO. While
  communications shelters have physical security controls in place,
  these are calibrated to risks associated with the communication
  equipment. Improper security can lead to the destruction of edge
  computing facilities, causing the connection to shut down and may lead
  to unlawful interception or loss of data.

- Vulnerabilities in MEC applications that may be used as an entry point
  for attacks aiming to exploit the virtualisation environments, provide
  unauthorised access to data, elevate privileges or bring about denial
  of service, potentially halting equipment loading in ports or halting
  the platooning convoys on roads.

- Use of a system function without successful authentication based on
  the user identity and at least one authentication attribute (e.g.
  password, certificate) opens up opportunities for exploitation and
  limits accountability, which can lead to information leakage to the
  attacker regarding the equipment being transported or the location and
  route of the convoys.

- Security log troubleshooting failure where compromised VNFs are used
  to generate a massive amount of logged data on the hypervisor,
  overriding the initial and relevant log entries and making the
  analysis of logged data futile.

- Software vulnerabilities: Execution of code that exploits existing
  vulnerabilities on running software and flaws within the MEC system
  such as buffer overflow. Data overflow can cause unpredictable changes
  in the system that can potentially halt the military use cases,
  causing shutdowns in ports and in convoys.

- Data exfiltration/destruction where the data from a compromised entity
  is transferred or destroyed without the required authorisation,
  affecting the system backend and necessary documentation.

- Malicious code injection where a malicious piece of code is injected
  into an active service by the attacker, or an executable file being
  transferred causing a loss of system integrity, availability, and
  confidentiality of data.

All relevant stakeholders, including [**NATO** and the **military**,
**need to take into account** the **multiple risks** that arise with
**MEC technology**]{.underline}. As this report demonstrates, [NATO
countries need to deal with continuous **risk assessment** about
**vulnerabilities**, **threats**, and the high risks associated with
**untrusted 5G vendors**]{.underline}, technology, [and infrastructure.
**Improper system design** and **lack of continuous risk** monitoring
leaves an open gap for **potential attackers** to **penetrate systems**
and get access to **high-confidentiality military data** and potentially
**damage military assets** when equipment is being unloaded in ports or
transported via road.]{.underline}

The following chapter proposes multiple **[mitigation measures for
cybersecurity]{.underline}** related risks, which if followed, [can
**significantly decrease** the potential of **malignant attacks** on
**military infrastructure and assets**]{.underline}.

### Military\-\--Tech Leadership\-\--2AC

#### Leading in the military 5G race underpins [all]{.underline} of the tech race.

Erica **Borghard 19**, Assistant Professor at the Army Cyber Institute
at West Pont; Shawn Longernan, Research Scholar at the Army Cyber
Institute and U.S. Army Reserve officer at the 75^th^ Innovation
Command, 4/25/2019, \"The Overlooked Military Implications of the 5G
Debate,\"
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/overlooked-military-implications-5g-debate>,
RMax

Last week, the U.S. Defense Innovation Board released a report outlining
the risks and opportunities for the United States in the global race to
develop 5G. This followed a damning report published by the United
Kingdom's Huawei Cyber Security Centre Oversight Board detailing how the
Chinese telecom giant's 5G products, particularly its software,
contained significant vulnerabilities and that the company had failed to
remedy persistent poor security practices. 5G network architecture uses
high frequency spectrum to enable significantly faster speeds to process
larger amounts of data with lower latency and greater device
connectivity. [While much attention has been paid to economic and
espionage implications of a potential Chinese lead in]{.underline}
developing and operating [**5G infrastructure**, there are **important
military implications** that remain largely **overlooked**]{.underline}.

There are economic implications for which entities can secure the
greatest global market share of 5G technology. Technological innovation
drives economic growth, job creation, and global economic influence.
Huawei may have a long-term market advantage over U.S and Western
telecoms because the former has been able to offer 5G products at far
cheaper rates than the latter. Furthermore, there are also concerns that
Chinese-built 5G technology is likely to contain backdoors that could be
used to enable Chinese economic or national security espionage. It is
unlikely that Beijing would actively monitor all of the content of the
data that comes across Huawei owned or operated infrastructure (although
it may collect and analyze metadata). However, it is conceivable that
Huawei would get a proverbial "tap on the shoulder" from Beijing to
share pertinent information in specific instances. This may include
individually targeting senior corporate executives, which is enabled by
the millimeter wave frequency that 5G networks employ.

[The military applications of 5G]{.underline} technology [have **vital
strategic** and **battlefield implications** for the U.S.]{.underline}
Historically, the U.S. military has reaped enormous advantages from
employing cutting edge technology on the battlefield. [**5G tech**nology
holds]{.underline} similar [**innovative potential**. Perhaps most
obviously, the next generation of **telecom**munications
**infra**structure will have a **direct impact** on improving **military
communications**]{.underline}. However, [it will also produce
**cascading effects** on the development of **other**]{.underline} kinds
of **[military tech]{.underline}**nologies, [such as **robotics** and
**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}. For instance,
[**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence and **m**achine **l**earning
capabilities]{.underline}, such as those used in the Department of
Defense's Project Maven, [could be greatly enhanced when
leveraging]{.underline} the [**data processing speeds** made possible
through **5G infra**structure]{.underline}. As an era of great power
competition emerges between the United States and China, [the United
States has a **compelling strategic interest** in being at the forefront
of]{.underline} these [new technologies]{.underline}.

[The **U**nited **S**tates and]{.underline} its [**allies**
must]{.underline} also [consider the **tactical** and **operational
implications** on the **battlefield** of conducting **conventional** or
**counterinsurgency operations** in an area with Chinese owned or
operated **5G infra**structure. This concern stems from the nature of
the relationship between Huawei]{.underline}, an ostensibly private
company, [and the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
**[(CCP)]{.underline}**. While Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei
proclaimed in a February 2019 interview on CBS This Morning that the
company never has and never would provide information to the Chinese
government, many experts are skeptical. Under China's 2017 National
Intelligence Law, [the CCP has]{.underline} the [authority to monitor
and investigate domestic and international companies as well as direct
organizations to assist with government espionage efforts]{.underline}.
As such, it is conceivable that Huawei will be required to hand over its
data to the Chinese government for collection and analysis.

Due to this reality, [the **U**nited **S**tates must]{.underline}
consider and [be prepared to conduct overseas contingency or
counterterrorism operations in areas where Chinese telecommunications
infrastructure is widely proliferated]{.underline}, thus restricting the
United States' ability to rely on indigenous telecoms. As noted by US
AFRICOM Commander General Thomas Waldhauser, this has already become an
issue in Africa where Chinese telecommunications companies are poised to
dominate. [The integrity of **U.S. military communications systems**
that rely on 5G]{.underline} networks [could be **undermined** at **key
phases** of an operation]{.underline}. For example, [if the United
States is conducting a military operation in an area of interest to
China]{.underline}, it is plausible that [the Chinese government could
leverage Huawei to **intercept** or even **deny military
communications**. Furthermore, Chinese telecom infrastructure
dominance]{.underline} in a theater of operations [may **limit** the
U.S. military's ability to conduct **precision targeting** that
leverages signals intelligence collection on 5G]{.underline}
telecommunications [networks]{.underline}. 

[The **strategic** and **battlefield implications** of who]{.underline}
owns and [operates 5G]{.underline} infrastructure [around the world
underscores the **national security importance** of **5G**. The U.S.
government and its allies should]{.underline} more systematically
[assess]{.underline} both [the opportunities and risks associated with
conducting future military operations in environments that rely on
Chinese technology]{.underline}.

### Military\-\--AT: 5G Not Key\-\--2AC

#### Only 5G solves future NATO military requirements\-\--nothing else satisfies latency and range requirements for communications, flexibility, and security. 

**Capela '21** \[Germano; July 2021; Radio Engineer at the NATO

Electronics, and Communications Engineering from Escola Naval; et al.;
\"5G for deployable and maritime communications,\"
https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCIS52405.2021.9486397\]

In \[1\], the authors have noted the potential of 5G technologies for
military applications and their significant interest for specific areas,
namely Deployable Communications and Information Systems (DCIS) and
Maritime Coastal Communications. In this context, NATO Allied Command
Transformation (ACT) tasked the NATO Communications and Information
(NCI) Agency to pursue capability development applications of 5G
technology in specific scenarios that could bring benefits to NATO.

[Effective and reliable]{.underline} command and control
(**[C2]{.underline}**) [of military operations]{.underline},
particularly those [involving any form of **mobility**, require the use
of **radio communication**]{.underline} networks. [In military
scenarios]{.underline}, the [utilization of radio]{.underline} networks
[usually entails deploying **infrastructure** in **remote areas** and in
highly **mobile military assets**, where]{.underline} other [traditional
means]{.underline} of communication [are not available or]{.underline}
are [not stable]{.underline} and reliable enough to cope with mission
requirements.

[The DCIS domain covers]{.underline} a wide range of [expeditionary
coalition operations, which]{.underline} may [occur anywhere in
**NATO**'s or national **areas of interest**]{.underline}. In this
paper, we address NATO provided infrastructure, but the same concepts
also apply to national implementations. [DCIS systems are
**self-contained**, **transportable** infrastructures and]{.underline}
they [have the challenges of providing **information services** and
interconnecting remote headquarter locations]{.underline}
(**[HQs]{.underline}**), [while being **easily assembled** and **torn
down**]{.underline} by common uniform personnel.

[C2 in **maritime** operations is]{.underline} a [complex]{.underline}
construct by itself [due to the intrinsic mobility of naval
platforms]{.underline}. Owing to the complexity of military vessels and
wide range of areas of operation -- inshore, shallow and blue waters --
[the range of **suitable communication systems** for
maritime]{.underline} operations [is very limited and consists
of]{.underline} either [expensive]{.underline} satellite reach-back
links [or limited capacity]{.underline}, long haul high-frequency (HF)
[connections]{.underline}.

The use of highly deployable, easy to install and operate radio systems
in military scenarios has been addressed in the literature and has
followed the natural evolution of wireless technologies. With the advent
of Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
(**[WiMAX]{.underline}**), which is a QoS-oriented radio access
technology, \[2\] and \[3\] investigated its adequacy for
mission-critical communications in the subject scenarios, but the
shortfalls outnumbered the eventual advantages of fielding WiMAX in
military contexts. More recently, the use of Long-Term Evolution
(**[LTE]{.underline}**) [and]{.underline} other International Mobile
Telecommunications (**[IMT]{.underline}**) [technologies]{.underline}
has also [gained interest for military applications]{.underline} and it
was thoroughly investigated in \[4\]. [However, there is **broad
consensus** that **complexity** of deployment, lack of proper **spectrum
supportability**, limited **throughput** and overall **security
measures** do not meet military requirements]{.underline}.

In this paper, we propose novel contributions to the military
communications scientific community by developing a proof-of-concept
experiments for two priority scenarios -- Small Operational Deployable
HQ (from the Deployable CIS domain) and Coastal Communications (from the
Maritime Communications domain) -- for assessing the adequacy and
maturity of existing and available 5G technologies for military
applications. [**5G technologies** represent a **paradigm shift** in IMT
standards and have **tremendous potential** for military
applications]{.underline}, as discussed in \[1\]. Fig. 1 depicts the
envisaged proof of concept scenario, [where both **maritime** and
deployable domains are combined]{.underline} in the same testing setup
and geographical area.

This paper focuses on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
\[5\] Release 16, as the target for existing and available features,
while Release 17 and beyond is regarded as soon to be available
features. The paper discusses the specific challenges and defines
concepts, architectures and metrics to be validated under experimental
conditions, with specific requirement and test parameters, and with
further intention to conduct and report on the experiments. To our
knowledge, this approach has not been presented in the literature and it
is deemed fundamental for informed scientific discussions on the
subject.

Section II describes and explores the potential 5G enablers for military
applications and clarifies the importance of experimentation and
validation activities. Sections III and IV outline the requirements for
two proof-of-concept experiments, first for a Deployable CIS scenario
and then for a Maritime Communications scenario. Finally, section V
concludes and discusses the expected outcomes for the experimental
endeavour.

SECTION II.

5G For Military Applications

On the technical side, NCI Agency conducted an assessment of 5G
technologies and their potential for military applications in a number
of reference scenarios. This work is reported in a technical working
paper \[1\], which gathered broad interest and support from Allies,
partners and military stakeholders. Owing to the complexity of the topic
and to the evolving nature of 5G specifications, the proposed effort
contributes to: a) Assessing technology readiness of 5G technologies,
with a scientific methodology; b) Identifying opportunities and gaps in
5G technologies for military application; c) Further develop priority 5G
military scenarios and concepts; and d) Providing conclusions and
recommendations for follow-on discussions with stakeholders. This paper
investigates a Small Operational Deployable HQ and a Coastal
Communications scenario -- representing the Deployable CIS and Maritime
Communications domains respectively -- which were identified in \[4\] as
high value and relatively low complexity to realize in the short term.

[Military operations are prone to **unforeseen events** and]{.underline}
changing operating conditions but on the other hand, [the]{.underline}
actual [level of **skilled support**, on the field, to
address]{.underline} highly complex [technical challenges, is
**limited**]{.underline}. Hence, [any deployed communications
system]{.underline} -- regardless of the domain -- [needs to be
**flexible** and **simple** enough to be operated by **unskilled
personnel** and]{.underline} to be [easily installed/torn down. Complex
electromagnetic]{.underline} (EM) [environments and **scarce spectrum
resources** also **limit the range** of viable]{.underline} radio-based
[communication solutions. Hence, the **coexistence** among other radio
systems has to be **accounted for**]{.underline} and such systems must
be able to adapt to new operating conditions. [Moreover, **hostile** EM
environments also **impose constraints** to]{.underline} the
[use]{.underline} of radio-based communication systems. This is highly
dependent on the nature of the operation and not a constant variable
along its existence.

The dynamism of available spectrum resources and intrinsic mobility of
forces poses significant challenges to any type of military
communications. [**5G** New Radio]{.underline} (**[NR]{.underline}**)
[features, such as multiple-input multiple-output]{.underline}
(**[MIMO]{.underline}**)[, **beam forming** and **c**omprehensive
**s**pectrum **s**upport]{.underline} -- Frequency Range (FR) 1 (410 to
7,125 MHz \[6\]) and FR2 (24.25 to 52.60 GHz \[7\]) (as of Release 16
\[8\]) -- [covers a wide range of communication scenarios and offers
**numerous possibilities** for **agile** and **harmonized radio
systems**]{.underline}. While FR1 provides coverage-capacity tradeoffs,
FR2 enables high bandwidth (but lower range) use cases. The advent of
NR--U, as a flexible way to use and combine unlicensed and licensed
spectrum \[9\] is also an enabler for improved spectrum agility. [When
compared to other commercial systems, **5G NR** enables **numerous
options** and **intrinsic agility**, which is deemed **extremely
relevant** for military scenarios]{.underline}.

[Another **key feature** of military scenarios is the ability to operate
**without** resorting to **fixed infrastructure**]{.underline}. In that
regard, the work developed by 3GPP to introduce Integrated Access and
Backhaul (IAB) \[10\], mobile edge computing \[11\] and to improve
Sidelink \[12\] is an indicator that [5G has enough **features** to
support **on-the-move** and **infrastructureless**
networking]{.underline}. Major IAB features and Sidelink improvements
are introduced in Release 16 and subsequent improvements considered for
Release 17. Nevertheless, these technologies are still immature and do
not have relevant market adoption yet. In fact, other industry
verticals, such as critical communications and automotive sectors, have
the exact same need as military users, which is to be able operate in an
infrastructure-less fashion. From a military standpoint, the lower the
chain of command, the more important mobility and resilience enabling
features are.

The military also extensively relies on various satellite networks to
cope with deployability and mobility requirements and their use is of
particular interest to land expeditionary and maritime operations. In
Release 16, [3GPP introduced]{.underline} the concept and started
studying [non-terrestrial networking]{.underline}
(**[NTN]{.underline}**) \[13\] [based on 5G NR, which consists of using
**airborne** or **spaceborne** vehicles as part of a 5G NR-enabled
**radio access** network. NTNs have the potential to **increase the
coverage** in deployed and tactical use cases]{.underline} by allowing
users to seamlessly roam between terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks, i.e. to provide service continuity between two different radio
access networks [without any service interruption]{.underline}. Even
though NR over NTN specifications are expected for Release 17, it is
important to regard NTN's potential in light of potential use of 5G for
military applications.

It is anticipated that the use of 5G in military scenarios comes with
several practical and technological challenges, particularly regarding
the context of use of commercial technologies:

Carrier-grade radio technologies typically require a comprehensive
deployment planning, they require highly skilled personnel to be
operated and maintained and their assigned spectrum resources are
typically stable and well defined. This could be limiting for high-tempo
deployments and operations.

Commercial technologies are not tailored to operate through challenging
and non-benign EM environments, which comprise compatibility with other
friendly radio systems and coping with intentional interference (i.e.
radio jamming). Deployment complexity and threat level can limit the use
of commercial technologies.

As a result of the investigations in \[1\], in the next chapter the
authors propose two proof--of--concept propositions for near-term
experimentation of expeditionary and maritime scenarios and concepts.

SECTION III.

Small Operational Deployable Headquarters

A. Introduction

In this section, we propose an experiment, using the combined 5G
proof-of-concept prototype, to assess the feasibility of 5G-enabled
concepts for providing combined wireless metropolitan area network
(WMAN) and wireless local area network (WLAN) distribution in support of
small operational deployable headquarters (DHQ) for NATO and national
expeditionary operations. Small Operational DHQ scenarios regard
expeditionary operations and the operational level of command (for
command & control (C2)), and consider the use of high-performance 5G
systems to provide wireless connectivity inside the DHQ (right portion
of Fig. 1), as enabler of quick DHQ setup and teardown.

B. Technical Concept

Small DHQs are made up of a few tents and shelters scattered around a
limited fenced-off area, typically resulting in a geographical footprint
of less than 0.25 km2, with maximum \~300--m distances between the
central CIS location and remote locations. Although these headquarters
are at the operational level of command, they are expected to be
deployed relatively closer to subordinate tactical headquarters and are
also expected to be subject to limited, but unneglectable, electronic
warfare (EW) threats, at least during the initial stages of the
operation.

When threat levels are deemed low (i.e., when it is possible to deploy
wireless systems), one could consider using combined WMAN & WLAN
distribution from a single wireless point-to-multipoint (PTMP) system
wirelessly connecting a central CIS location to network terminals
(phones, computers and other devices), to enable very short DHQ
establishment times (in terms of CIS connectivity), without the need to
lay local area network (LAN) cables between tents (using tactical fibre
optical cables) and then to network terminals (using cabled LAN
infrastructure).

Currently, NATO does not use these concepts for two reasons: commercial
technologies, such as Wi-Fi systems, do not offer suitable performance
to be used as a combined LAN access and LAN distribution systems in
small DHQs, and traditional IMT technologies, such as LTE, have limited
system capacity and are not available in frequency bands of interest for
military applications. When compared to carrier-based solutions, Wi--Fi
tends to fall behind in terms of range, spectrum agility, mobility
management and overall QoS. Hence, a 5G solution would provide superior
coverage, requiring less infrastructure density/complexity, while
assuring superior QoS features. Moreover, 5G NR enables the combined use
of licensed and unlicensed bands, which is of great advantage in this
scenario. Through 5G NR-U (NR for unlicensed bands), one can provide
nominal capacity by anchoring the system in a military band (e.g. 4.4 -
5.0 GHz), while using the 5 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM)
band as supplementary band, when and where available for use. This way,
a high degree of service quality is provided, since the system can
assure 'a minimum and guaranteed' capacity through a licenced band, and
increase its capacity by aggregating available unlicensed bands.

[Current solutions in **NATO**]{.underline} DCIS [resort to **wired
LAN** distribution systems]{.underline} for practical reasons -- [to
provide adequate **capacity** and to cope with existing **security
policies**]{.underline} (which prevent using wireless LAN systems for
higher classification domains).

[Deploying a combined **wireless** LAN distribution and **access
system** based on **5G** technology]{.underline} ([which has intrinsic
**advanced mobility management** features]{.underline}) [would provide
**significant operational benefits**]{.underline}, such as:

- [Fast DHQ setup and tear-down times]{.underline}.

- [End-to-end quality of service]{.underline} (provided that encrypted
  traffic is appropriately recognized by the system).

- [High mobility for C2 personnel]{.underline} to roam inside the DHQ.

C. Requirements for a 5G-based Proof of Concept

Due to the nature of small DHQs, the proposed architecture is predicated
in privately owned and operated infrastructure, which represents the
most flexible and agile type of employment such a concept could be used,
i.e. out of area operations where public infrastructure is not
available/does not exist.

For [this architecture]{.underline}, illustrated in Fig. 2, a
single-tier [high-capacity 5G-based combined]{.underline} WMAN/WLAN
system [in]{.underline} the 5G Sub-6-GHz [(mid)]{.underline} frequency
[band]{.underline}, ideally in the 4.4-5.0 GHz band (often referred to
as NATO Band IV), [would provide both **capacity** and
**flexibility**]{.underline}: a single 5G base station (gNB) would
provide both high capacity (i.e., up to a total system capacity of up to
\~4 Gbit/s over a 400 MHz wideband radio channel) and mobility around
the small DHQ, as the tents are mostly transparent to radio frequencies.
Users could use this infrastructure to carry all application services
(real-time and non-real-time traffic, etc.).

[Using]{.underline} the [4.4-5.0 GHz]{.underline} band, while not ideal
for mobile communications but desirable for spectrum management aspects,
[would be compensated by the **high-performance features** of 5G NR,
such as **beam forming** and massive **MIMO**]{.underline}, as well as
the fact that tactical tents are electromagnetically transparent (as
opposed to buildings). While the WMAN/WLAN system can rely on the
4.4-5.0 GHz band to provide the regular capacity, additional portions of
unlicensed spectrum (5 GHz band) can supplement capacity in surge
moments or whenever available. This can be achieved through 5G NR--U,
where the 4.4-5.0 GHz band would become the anchor band and the 5 GHz
the supplementary band.

As a DoD example, [**current radios** provide **limited support** for
controlling devices traveling at **hypersonic speed**. The U.S. doesn't
have]{.underline} operational [hypersonic missiles yet, but it's a **top
priority**]{.underline}. According to the Government Accountability

[The **best way** to **counter** China's and Russia's high-tech advances
is to change the Pentagon's]{.underline} and Congress' [risk-aversion
culture and embrace quicker]{.underline} -- but still robust --
[**testing** and **fielding** of programs]{.underline}, a senior defense
official said Tuesday.

Mark Lewis, [speaking at an online forum of the Hudson
Institute](https://www.hudson.org/events/1835-video-event-a-conversation-with-dr-mark-lewis-on-the-pentagon-s-defense-modernization-priorities62020),
said, ["there are **dumb failures** and **noble failures**" in
**testing**. Some of the **"dumb failures"** occur because the testing
was not **rapid** or **robust**, which]{.underline} has the potential to
[sink a project but is also **easily fixable**]{.underline} in the
future.

In looking to avoid that mistake, the director of defense research and
engineering for modernization added, ["we]{.underline} recognize we [are
in a **race**]{.underline}," particularly [with China in the development
of **hypersonic weapons** and the application of **5G connectivity** to
the battlefield]{.underline}.

All too often, [there has been a failure to transition from
science]{.underline}, technology, research and development projects [to
**full production** because they lacked continuous testing or there was
an unwillingness to accept any failure]{.underline}, he said.

Speaking at the Atlantic Council in another online security forum on
modernization, Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for
policy, called that gap "the graveyard" of promising technology that
needs to be eliminated.

"We have to get Congress to trust DoD taking more risk" in testing new
systems like hypersonics, she added.

Lewis also used **[hypersonics]{.underline}** as an example, saying "we
really do think [it's a **game-changer**]{.underline}" in military
thinking. [These systems offer **speed**, **maneuverability** and
**trajectory** and range]{.underline}.

Because they are in the atmosphere but moving at five times the speed of
sound, [hypersonics weapons "are **more difficult to detect** from the

as it did with the F-16s and F-22 fighters to balance capability and

air-breathing systems.

for both systems before then.

"Our competitors should not doubt that we are ... in a very aggressive

[At the Atlantic
Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/event/the-future-of-high-tech-warfare/),
retired Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright said [developing "technology
is the easy side of the question]{.underline}. What do we want to do
with our security as we go forward" was the unanswered question.
Flournoy said some [answers could come through **more wargaming** on
**innovative concepts** of operations on new systems like
**hypersonics** and]{.underline} advanced [technologies like
**5G**]{.underline}.

Using the connectivity of advanced telecommunications as an example of
what future needs will be, Lewis said, "we don't see [5G]{.underline} as
a single goal post." He termed it a technology that will change over
time. "It [allows us to do **many more things**]{.underline}" than were
possible in earlier technologies and provides resilience not available
in the past. [The 5G advantage now is it "provides full connectivity of
services and sensors --- the internet of things" and allows the services
to operate in **any environment or domain**.]{.underline}

He added, "China is making a big play on the hardware side" of 5G. But
potentially more troubling is China's [attempt to set standards on use
and operations, particularly through
Huawei](https://news.usni.org/2020/04/09/veneer-of-chinas-charm-offensive-cracked-by-vietnamese-fishing-boat-incident),
an international telecommunications and information provider
corporation.

Like it did with 4G, "we think [the United States **has to lead** and
**set the standards**]{.underline} ... [for deciding the
future]{.underline}," Lewis said. The United States has consistently
warned allies and partners the danger that Huawei poses to their
security by installing backdoor software to spy on or alter critical
infrastructure. U.S. protests have met only with middling success, even
in Europe.

Christian Brose, author of Kill Chain and a former staff member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said at the Atlantic Council forum that
the Chinese Communist Party has been "systematically building a military
to counter the United States" using advanced technologies.

Lewis said they "learned from us" as the United States rested on its
laurels of stealth, making early investment in hypersonics and
artificial intelligence and continuing to invest in these areas.

Cartwright drove home that the [technologies aren't just]{.underline}
there [for technology's sake, but]{.underline} rather [have
**operational implications** if a **conflict arose**]{.underline}.

"[The systems]{.underline} are there [\[inside the

said. Instead of thinking days or weeks are available to move forces,
[the response needs to be available "at the speed of gaming"

5G and hypersonic weapons

[With a **super-fast network** able to exchange **data** in

something that's long been talked about in the military: **hypersonic
weapons**.]{.underline}

[Now being developed by **Russia**, **China**, the USA and

at **Mach 5** -- five times the speed of sound -- and will cover a

[They will]{.underline} also [fly at **very high altitudes** and on
**unpredictable flight paths**, **easily skirting** existing missile

but so is guiding them]{.underline}.

[Where 5G comes in, is in **hypersonic defense systems**. An aircraft

**less than a minute** to react to an **incoming hypersonic

Are HS/HM Weapons Destabilizing?

It has been demonstrated that none of the great nuclear powers require
HS/HM weapons to achieve a credible retaliatory strike capability. The
volume of both Russian and Chinese current land-based ballistic missile
arsenals taken individually make each countries' second-strike
capability unquestionable. There is no established need for either
country to develop HS/HM weapons as a means to assure this capability.
Using current capabilities and fielded forces, the United States, Russia
and China all maintain robust nuclear deterrence forces that maintain
the established status quo that has prevented great-power conflict for
seven decades. From a strictly technological aspect, HS/HM weapons have
not altered each countries' ability to achieve a credible retaliatory
capability and as a result have not fundamentally changed the deterrence
status quo from this perspective. However, as [**HS/HM weapons** create
**new capabilities** and **alter** how **decisions** are made and how
long a country has to make a retaliatory decision, these weapons are
**seen** as **more threatening** and **aggressive** than current fielded
forces. This]{.underline} perception [has the potential to
**destabilize** the **status quo**.]{.underline}

As [**these weapons** are **significantly harder to track** and
**terminate** than traditional ballistic warheads and as they create a
shortened timeline to make a retaliatory decision]{.underline} prior to
receiving a potential first strike, [they are seen as]{.underline}
naturally offensive weapons that are **[far more threatening and
aggressive]{.underline}**. As described earlier, [a country at risk of
receiving an HS/HM attack has a **significantly reduced
timeline**]{.underline} (from the point of detecting an incoming HS/HM
weapon and warning) [to make a **decision**]{.underline} as to a
retaliatory strike prior to receiving the first hit. Complicating
matters further, [the aggrieved country has little capability to
determine the most likely impact point]{.underline} of such a strike
meaning any retaliatory efforts are not likely to be calculated to
achieve a proportionate response making any retaliation naturally
disproportionate. [These issues **complicate** the decisionmaking
process for a threatened country, which will]{.underline} likely [drive
**changes** to that country's **deterrence posture**]{.underline}.

[The **most concerning aspect**]{.underline} of this new calculus [is
the possibility of a country that is threatened by HS/HM strikes to
adopt a "**launch-on-warning posture**" or a possibility of moving
towards a policy of **preemptive strike**]{.underline}.61 [A
launch-on-warning posture relies heavily on a **very robust** and
**highly accurate warning apparatus** that is **not prone** to
**misidentification**]{.underline} of threats, which is dubious at best
and a preemptive strike posture would fundamentally change the
longstanding deterrence postures of the great nuclear powers. [Both
possibilities would **lower the threshold** for use of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} in warfare [and]{.underline}, especially in the
case of a launch-on-warning posture, [**significantly increase** the
probability of **accidental launch**]{.underline}.

Of further concern is the [**threat** that HS/HM weapons represent to
**no-first-use** policies established by all]{.underline} three [great
**nuclear powers**]{.underline}. [It is currently challenging to launch
a preemptive nuclear first strike that could achieve decapitation
of]{.underline} an [adversary's forces based on an ability to detect and
track an incoming warhead with sufficient time to make a decision on
retaliatory measures]{.underline} prior to receiving the first strike.
[HS/HM weapons **shorten** that decision timeline **significantly** such
that an aggressing country may believe it has a **greater chance** of
achieving a **successful first strike**, **even if** the reality is that
these weapons are extremely unlikely to be manufactured in such quantity
as to confidently prevent a retaliatory strike. Any country that
possesses a **belief**, even if that belief is **not** based in reality,
that it can **win** a **nuclear war** increases the probability of that
country using these weapons in an offensive and coercive manner to
achieve its objectives. This]{.underline} also [**lowers the threshold**
for]{.underline} the [use of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline} in
warfare.

An offensive and coercive posture, or [the **perception** of such a
posture enacted by one country is **conducive** to **more aggressive
defensive** and **offensive counter-posturing** by another
country]{.underline}. While it has been demonstrated that the
development of HS/HM technology does not threaten the retaliatory
capability of any of the great nuclear powers, [the **perceptions**
surrounding decisions to pursue]{.underline} such a program [lead to
misperception of intentions that appear to be aggressive and hostile,
which]{.underline} in turn [has the significant potential to
**destabilize** the **deterrence** status quo.]{.underline}

Conclusions

[Hypersonic/highly-maneuverable weapons represent a **leap** in the
**technological efficiency** of **nuclear delivery systems**. These
weapons travel at such a speed and possess a maneuverability to make
them **difficult** to **detect** and **track**]{.underline}. However,
due to the engineering difficulty and the materials needed, which drive
a significant cost for such a program, it is highly unlikely that any
country will manufacture these weapons in such a quantity as to threaten
the current deterrence status quo. As a result, [it is not the
technology itself, but the **perceptions** of the intentions surrounding
HS/HM programs that challenges the stability of the nuclear deterrence
model.]{.underline} The lack of understanding of great nuclear power
nations' intentions regarding HS/HM weapons has the most potential to
destabilize the deterrence status quo and lower the threshold for the
use of nuclear weapons.

[Warfare has always been carried out at the boundary between **chaos**
and **order**]{.underline}. Strategists have long tried to suppress the
chaos and impose order by means of intelligence, communication, and
command and control. [The **most powerful weapon** is **useless**

the best intelligence is worthless if it arrives too late. No wonder
that [over the past two centuries, as technologies]{.underline} such as
photography, electronic communications, and computing [became available,
they were **quickly absorbed** into **military operations**]{.underline}
and often enhanced by targeted defense R&D.

wireless communications**. The United States, Europe, China, and Russia
are]{.underline} now [integrating 5G technologies into their military
networks. These are **sizable** and **complicated projects**, and
several different strategies are **already** becoming
apparent.]{.underline}

At **[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}**, we're [enhancing standard 5G
technologies to connect the many platforms and networks that are fielded
by the various branches of the armed services]{.underline}. We call this
our 5G.MIL initiative. Earlier this year, [in two projects]{.underline},
called [Hydra and HiveStar, we demonstrated the feasibility of key
aspects of this initiative. Hydra yielded **encouraging results** on the
**interoperability challenge**]{.underline}, and HiveStar showed that it
was possible to quickly construct, in an area with no existing
infrastructure, a highly mobile and yet capable 5G network, as would be
required on a battlefield.

\[their card ends\]

The new work takes an unusual approach. It is a collaboration with
commercial industry in which technology is transferred from the civilian
to the military sector, not the other way around. Radar, rocketry, and
nuclear energy got their starts in military labs, and it took years,
even generations, for these technologies to trickle into consumer
products. But today, for fundamental technologies such as computing and
communications, the sheer scale of private-sector development is
increasingly beyond the resources of even the largest national defense
agencies. To deploy networks that are sufficiently fast, adaptive,
agile, and interoperable, warfighters now have little alternative but to
exploit commercial developments. No wonder, then, that the U.S.
Department of Defense, through an initiative called 5G to NextG, and
various complementary investments from individual armed services, has
committed upwards of US \$2 billion to advance commercial 5G research
and to perform tests and experiments to adapt the results for military
purposes. To understand the significance of such a shift, consider how
the United States got to this juncture. In 18th-century conflicts, such
as the Revolutionary War, the only battlefield sensors were human eyes
and ears. Long-distance communication could take days and could be
interrupted if the messengers it relied on were captured or killed.
Tactical battlefield decisions were signaled by flags or runners to
commence maneuvers or attacks. By World War II, combatants had radar,
aircraft, and radios to sense enemy planes and bombers up to 80 miles
ahead. They could communicate from hundreds of miles away and prepare
air defenses and direct fighter-interceptor squadrons within minutes.
Photoreconnaissance could supply invaluable intelligence---but in hours
or days, not seconds. Today, the field of battle is intensively
monitored. There are countless sensors on land, sea, air, space, and
even in cyberspace. Jet fighters, such as the F-35, can act as
information-processing hubs in the sky to fuse all that data into a
single integrated picture of the battlefield, then share that picture
with war fighters and decision makers, who can thus execute command and
control in near real time. Three Lockheed Martin military aircraft,
built in different eras, have different communications systems designed
to make it hard for an adversary to detect a transmission. In a project
called Hydra, engineers used electronic systems called open-system
gateways to enable the three to communicate freely. From the top, the
aircraft are the F-22, the U-2S, and the F-35. Lockheed Martin At least,
that's the goal. The reality often falls short. The networks that knit
together all these sensors are a patchwork. Some of them run over
civilian commercial infrastructure and others are military, and among
the military ones, different requirements among the different branches
and other factors have contributed to an assortment of high-performance
but largely incompatible communication protocols. Messages may not
propagate across these networks quickly or at all. Here's why that's a
problem. Say that an F-35 detects an incoming ballistic missile. The
aircraft can track the missile in real time. But today it may not be
able to convey that tracking data all the way to antimissile batteries
in time for them to shoot down the projectile. That's the kind of
capability the 5G.MIL initiative is aiming for. There are broader goals,
too, because future battlefields will up the ante on complexity. Besides
weapons, platforms, and gear, individual people will be outfitted with
network-connected sensors monitoring their location, exposures to
biochemical or radioactive hazards, and physical condition. To connect
all these elements will require global mesh networks of thousands of
nodes, including satellites in space. The networks will have to
accommodate hypersonic systems moving faster than five times the speed
of sound, while also being capable of controlling or launching
cyberattacks, electronic warfare and countermeasures, and
directed-energy weapons. Such technologies will fundamentally change the
character and speed of war and will require an omnipresent
communications backbone to manage capabilities across the entire
battlefield. The sheer range of coordinated activities, the volume of
assets, the complexity of their interactions, and their worldwide
distribution would quickly overwhelm the computing and network
capabilities we have today. The time from observation to decision to
action will be measured in milliseconds: When a maneuvering hypersonic
platform moves more than 3.5 kilometers per second, knowing its location
even a second ago may be of little use for a system designed to track
it. Our 5G.MIL vision has two complementary elements. One is exemplified
by the opening scenario of this article: the quick, ad hoc establishment
of secure, local networks based on 5G technology. The goal here is to
let forces take sensor data from any platform in the theater and make it
accessible to any shooter, no matter how the platform and the shooter
each connect to the network. Aircraft, ships, satellites, tanks, or even
individual soldiers could connect their sensors to the secure 5G network
via specially modified 5G base stations. Like commercial 5G base
stations, these hybrid base stations could handle commercial 5G and 4G
LTE cellular traffic. They could also share data via military tactical
links and communications systems. In either case, these battlefield
connections would take the form of secure mesh networks. In this type of
network, nodes have intelligence that enables them to connect to one
another directly to self-organize and self-configure into a network, and
then jointly manage the flow of data. Inside the hybrid base station
would be a series of systems called tactical gateways, which enable the
base station to work with different military communication protocols.
Such gateways already exist: They consist of hardware and software based
on military-prescribed open-architecture standards that enable a
platform, such as a fighter jet made by one contractor, to communicate
with, say, a missile battery made by another supplier. The second
element of the 5G.MIL vision involves connecting these local mesh
networks to the global Internet. Such a connection between a local
network and the wider Internet is known as a backhaul. In our case, the
connection might be on the ground or in space, between civilian and
military satellites. The resulting globe-spanning backhaul networks,
composed of civilian infrastructure, military assets, or a mixture of
both, would in effect create a software-defined virtual global defense
network. The software-defined aspect is important because it would allow
the networks to be reconfigured---automatically---on the fly. That's a
huge challenge right now, but it's critical because it would provide the
flexibility needed to deal with the exigencies of war. At one moment,
you might need an enormous video bandwidth in a certain area; in the
next, you might need to convey a huge amount of targeting data.
Alternatively, different streams of data might need different levels of
encryption. Automatically reconfigurable software-defined networks would
make all of this possible. The military advantage would be that software
running on the network could use data sourced from anywhere in the world
to pinpoint location, identify friends or foes, and to target hostile
forces. Any authorized user in the field with a smartphone could see on
a Web browser, with data from this network, the entire battlefield, no
matter where it was on the planet. We partnered recently with the U.S.
Armed Services to demonstrate key aspects of this 5G.MIL vision. In
March 2021, Lockheed Martin's Project Hydra demonstrated bidirectional
communication between the Lockheed F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters and a
Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance plane in flight, and then down to ground
artillery systems. This latest experiment, part of a series that began
in 2013, is an example of connecting systems with communications
protocols that are unique to their mission requirements. All three
planes are made by Lockheed Martin, but their different chronologies and
battlefield roles resulted in different custom communications links that
aren't readily compatible. Project Hydra enabled the platforms to
communicate directly via an open-system gateway that translates data
between native communications links and other weapons systems. Emerging
technologies will fundamentally change the character and speed of war
and will require an omnipresent communications backbone to manage
capabilities across the entire battlefield. It was a promising outcome,
but reconnaissance and fighter aircraft represent only a tiny fraction
of the nodes in a future battle space. Lockheed Martin has continued to
build off Project Hydra, introducing additional platforms in the network
architecture. Extending the distributed-gateway approach to all
platforms can make the resulting network resilient to the loss of
individual nodes by ensuring that critical data gets through without
having to spend money to replace existing platform radios with a new,
common radio. Another series of projects with a software platform called
HiveStar showed that a fully functional 5G network could be assembled
using base stations about the size of a cereal box. What's more, those
base stations could be installed on modestly sized multicopters and
flown around a theater of operations---this network was literally "on
the fly." The HiveStar team carried out a series of trials this year
culminating in a joint demonstration with the U.S. Army's Ground Vehicle
Systems Center. The objective was to support a real-world Army need:
using autonomous vehicles to deliver supplies in war zones. The team
started simply, setting up a 5G base station and establishing a
connection to a smartphone. The base-station hardware, a gNodeB in
industry parlance, was an OctNode2, from Octasic in Montreal. The base
station weighs about 800 grams and measures about 24 × 15 × 5
centimeters. A white 3-D printed box housed processors for
distributed-computing and communications software, called HiveStar. The
housings were mounted on unpiloted aerial vehicles for a demonstration
of a fully airborne 5G network.Lockheed Martin The team then tested the
compact system in an area without existing infrastructure, as might very
well be true of a war zone or disaster area. The team mounted the gNodeB
and a tactical radio operating in the S band on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro
hexacopter and flew the package over a test range at Lockheed Martin's
Waterton, Colo., facility. The system passed the test: It established 5G
connectivity between this roving cell tower in the sky with a tablet on
the ground. Next, the team set about wirelessly connecting a group of
base stations together into a flying, roving heterogeneous 5G military
network that could perform useful missions. For this they relied on
Lockheed-Martin developed software called HiveStar, which manages
network coverage and distributes tasks among network nodes---in this
case, the multicopters cooperating to find and photograph the target.
This management is dynamic: if one node is lost to interference or
damage, the remaining nodes adjust to cover the loss. For the team's
first trial, they chose a pretty standard military chore: locate and
photograph a target using multiple sensor systems, a function called tip
and cue. In a war zone such a mission might be carried out by a
relatively large UAV outfitted with serious processing power. Here the
team used the gNodeB and S-band radio setup as before, but with a slight
difference. All 5G networks need a software suite called 5G core
services, which is responsible for such basic functions as
authenticating a user and managing the handoffs from tower to tower. In
this trial, those core functions were running on a standard Dell
PowerEdge R630 1U rack-mounted server on the ground. So the network
consisted of the gNodeB on the lead copter, which communicated with the
ground using 5G and depended on the core services on the ground
computers. The lead copter communicated using S-band radio links, with
several camera copters and one search copter with a software-defined
radio programmed to detect an RF pulse in the target frequency. The team
worked with the HiveStar software, which managed the network's
communications and computing, via the 5G tablet. All that was needed was
a target for the copters to search for. So the team outfitted a remotely
controlled toy jeep, about 1 meter long, with a software-defined radio
emitter as a surrogate target. The team initiated the tip-and-cue
mission by entering commands on the 5G tablet. The lead copter acted as
a router to the rest of the heterogeneous 5G and S-band network.
Messages initiating the mission were then distributed to the other
cooperating copters via the S-band radio connection. Once these camera
platforms received the messages, their onboard HiveStar mission software
cooperated to autonomously distribute tasks among the team to execute
search maneuvers. The multicopters lifted off in search of the target RF
emitter. Once the detecting copter located the target jeep's radio
signal, the camera copters quickly sped to the area and captured images
of the jeep. Then, via the 5G gNodeB, they sent these images, along with
precise latitude and longitude information, to the tablet. Mission
accomplished. Next the team thought of ways to fly the entire 5G system,
freeing it from any dependence on specific locations on the ground. To
do this, they had to put the 5G core services on the lead copter, the
one outfitted with the gNodeB. Working with a partner company, they
loaded the core services software onto a single board computer, an
Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX, along with the gNodeB. For the lead copter,
which would carry this gear, they chose a robust, industrial-grade
quadcopter, the Freefly Alta X. They equipped it with the Nvidia board,
antennas, filters, and the S-band radios. At the Army's behest, the team
came up with a plan to use the flying network to demonstrate
leader-follower autonomous-vehicle mobility. It's a convoy: A human
drives a lead vehicle, and up to eight autonomous vehicles follow
behind, using routing information transmitted to them from the lead
vehicle. Just as in the tip-and-cue demonstration, the team established
a heterogeneous 5G and S-band network with the upgraded 5G payload and a
series of supporting copters that formed a connected S-band mesh
network. This mesh connected the convoy to a second, identical convoy
several kilometers away, which was also served by a copter-based 5G and
S-band base station. After the commander initiated the mission, the
Freefly Alta X flew itself above the lead vehicle at a height of about
100 meters and connected to it via the 5G link. The HiveStar
mission-controller software directed the supporting multicopters to
launch, form, and maintain the mesh network. The vehicle convoy started
its circuit around a test range about 10 km in circumference. During
this time, the copter connected via 5G to the lead convoy vehicle would
relay position and other telemetric information to the other vehicles in
the convoy, while following overhead as the convoy traveled at around 50
km per hour. Data from the lead vehicle was shared by this relay to
following vehicles as well as the second convoy via the distributed
multicopter-based S-band mesh network. Illustration of satellites and
other elements and how they are all connected. Current 5G standards do
not include connections via satellites or aircraft. But planned
revisions, designated Release 17 by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project consortium, are expected next year and will support
nonterrestrial networking capabilities for 5G.Chris Philpot The team
also challenged the system by simulating the loss of one of the data
links (either 5G or S-band) due to jamming or malfunction. If a 5G link
was severed, the system immediately switched to the S band, and vice
versa, to maintain connectivity. Such a capability would be important in
a war zone, where jamming is a constant threat. Though encouraging, the
Hydra and HiveStar trials were but first steps, and many high hurdles
will have to be cleared before the scenario that opens this article can
become reality. Chief among these is expanding the coverage and range of
the 5G-enabled networks to continental or intercontinental range,
increasing their security, and managing their myriad connections. We are
looking to the commercial sector to bring big ideas to these challenges.
Satellite constellations, for instance, can provide a degree of global
coverage, along with cloud-computing services via the internet and the
opportunity for mesh networking and distributed computing. And though
today's 5G standards do not include space-based 5G access, the Release
17 standards coming in 2022 from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
consortium will natively support nonterrestrial networking capabilities
for the 5G ecosystem. So we're working with our commercial partners to
integrate their 3GPP-compliant capabilities to enable direct-to-device
5G connectivity from space. In the meantime, we're using the
HiveStar/multicopter platform as a surrogate to test and demonstrate our
space-based 5G concepts. Security will entail many challenges.
Cyberattackers can be counted on to attempt to exploit any
vulnerabilities in the software-defined networking and
network-virtualization capabilities of the 5G architecture. The huge
number of vendors and their suppliers will make it hard to perform due
diligence on all of them. And yet we must protect against such attacks
in a way that works with any vendor's products rather than rely, as in
the past, on a limited pool of preapproved solutions with proprietary
(and incompatible) security modifications. The advent of ultrafast 5G
technology is an inflection point in military technology. Another
interesting little challenge is presented by the 5G waveform itself.
It's made to be easily discovered to establish the strongest connection.
But that won't work in military operations where lives depend on
stealth. Modifications to the standard 5G waveform, and how it's
processed within the gNodeB, can achieve transmission that's hard for
adversaries to pick up.

Perhaps [the **greatest challenge**]{.underline}, though, [is how to
orchestrate a **global network** built on **mixed commercial** and
**military infrastructure**. To succeed here will require
**collaboration** with commercial]{.underline} mobile-network [operators
to develop better ways to authenticate user connections, control network
capacity, and share RF spectrum]{.underline}. For software applications
to make use of 5G's low latency, [we'll]{.underline} also [have to find
new, innovative ways of managing distributed cloud-computing
resources.]{.underline}

[It's **not a leap** to see the advent of ultrafast 5G technology as an
**inflection point** in **military technology**]{.underline}. As
artificial intelligence, unpiloted systems, directed-energy weapons, and
other technologies become cheaper and more widely available, threats
will proliferate in both number and diversity. [**Communications and

highlighted in the summary of the 2018 U.S. National Defense Strategy,
the strategic guidance document issued every four years by the U.S. DOD:
"Success no longer goes to the country that develops a new technology
first, but rather to the one that better integrates it and adapts its
way of fighting."

Here, it is worth noting that [**Chinese companies** are among the

market for 5G technology]{.underline}, similar to the combined market
shares of Ericsson and Nokia. Chinese market share could very well
increase: According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Chinese
government backs companies that build 5G infrastructures in countries
China invests in as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Meanwhile, in
Europe, NATO unveiled its first 5G military test site in Latvia in 2020.
Norway, notably, is exploring dedicating software-defined networks in
commercial 5G infrastructure to support military missions.

Perhaps this convergence of commercial and defense-sector development
around 5G, 6G, and future communications technologies will lead to
powerful and unexpected commercial applications. The defense sector gave
the world the Internet. The world now gives militaries 5G communications
and beyond. Let's find out what the defense sector can give back.

Scenarios Involving Cyber-Driven Pathways to Nuclear Crisis

To illustrate what is at stake [if **cyber risks** are not adequately
addressed]{.underline}, below are [**several nuclear scenarios** in
which cyber attacks]{.underline} by one side on the other might [have a
**real** and **tangible effect** on the the likelihood of **nuclear
use**]{.underline}.

[A first scenario involves differing **perceptions** of cyber
penetrations of NC3 during a **nuclear crisis**. Cyber attacks and cyber
espionage]{.underline}/intelligence gathering (cyber exploitation) [use
the same penetration techniques and differ only in what they
seek]{.underline} to accomplish. Thus, [any]{.underline} given cyber
[penetration carries with it an **unknown potential** for both
**attack** and exploitation. A cyber penetration]{.underline} from
nation A detected in nation B's NC3 system [could be]{.underline} part
of [a]{.underline} relatively [benign attempt to gather intelligence.
Or]{.underline} it could be [the start of a serious cyber attack. It is
**impossible** for nation B to know]{.underline} nation A's intentions
before the payloads are executed. A worst-case assessment would regard
A's penetration as the start of an attack on B's NC3 system.28

A [second scenario could arise when a nation chooses to
combine]{.underline} (that is, [to **entangle**]{.underline}) [nuclear
C3 and conventional C3]{.underline} functions [on the same technology
platforms]{.underline} and take advantage of the same command, control,
and communications infrastructure for reasons of economy. [During
the]{.underline} initial stages of a [conflict, nation A may target
nation B's conventional C3]{.underline} infrastructure for the
understandable and militarily justified purpose of degrading B's
conventional combat power. But [if the]{.underline} technological
[infrastructure for **both**]{.underline} conventional and nuclear C3
[is the **same**, such an attack could]{.underline} actually [degrade
B's nuclear C3 capabilities as well as give rise to **concerns** that A
is]{.underline} deliberately [trying to degrade B's nuclear capabilities
**preemptively**.]{.underline}29

[A third scenario stems from the fact that offensive cyber capabilities
are]{.underline} usually [concealed out of a concern that]{.underline},
if revealed, [an adversary will be able to negate those
capabilities]{.underline}.30 [If nation A is able to penetrate nation
B's nuclear enterprise **clandestinely**, A has the advantage over B
without B realizing it. In a crisis, A knows it has the upper
hand]{.underline} over B [and feels **no need** to **refrain** from
escalation]{.underline}. However, [B does not know about the
penetration, and, believing itself to be as strong as it ever was, does
not know that it would be **wise** to **refrain from escalation**. Each
side's unwillingness to **refrain** from **escalation** creates **more
risk** for the **other side**]{.underline}.

[A fourth scenario has to do with using **cyber attacks** to damage an
adversary's **confidence** in its **nuclear capabilities**. Seeking to
compromise an adversary's **nuclear deterrent** and exploiting
vulnerabilities]{.underline} in its supply chains, [nation A places
malware]{.underline} (or hardware vulnerabilities) [on]{.underline} a
number of [nation B's nuclear delivery platforms. During an **escalating
crisis**, A communicates to B what it has done]{.underline} and
demonstrates that it has done so by providing clues that allow B to
discover these vulnerabilities. A then informs B that it has done this
on many more of B's platforms. [B now must consider how to react as it
tries to determine what is]{.underline} mere [**boasting** and
which]{.underline} of B's [platforms have been **genuinely
compromised**]{.underline}.

[For every positive business outcome that **5G brings**, it also has an
equal and opposite **cybersecurity risk.**]{.underline} Here are a few
known risks:

**[IoT exposure]{.underline}**

Companies need to adopt IoT devices as part of their business
strategies, but they come with inherent security vulnerabilities, like
misconfigurations and lack of standardized security practices. The same
5G high-speed, low-latency connections that provide value for the
enterprise also give cybercriminals a way to rapidly execute network
attacks.

Some examples of attacks that leverage insecure IoT devices include:

**[Botnets]{.underline}**

Distributed denial of service (DDoS)

**[Man-in-the-middle]{.underline}**

Call interception and location tracking

**[Compromised Network Slice]{.underline}**

Network slicing helps enable security, but its complexity can lead to
insecure implementations. Currently, network administrators are on their
own trying to implement these new networking architectures.

Without standards or guides, network administrators may not be able to
build the appropriate security into their implementations, accidentally
giving cybercriminals a way to gain unauthorized access to the network
slice. For example, cybercriminals can compromise the network by
leveraging this attack vector then use it as a steppingstone to data
breaches or DDoS attacks.

**[Stretched Security Monitoring Resources]{.underline}**

[As 5G expands the number of devices that can connect to networks, it
increases the amount of **security resources** needed to monitor these
new access points.]{.underline} Adding more IoT devices to the
organization's infrastructure enables productivity and efficiency, but
every device needs to be monitored continuously.

Cyber (in)security

5G is generally considered more secure than previous networks (2G, 3G,
4G LTE) due to better encryption58 and the ability for network slicing,
which makes potential breaches less likely and less damaging.59 Since 5G
is an evolution of 4G LTE, developers of this technology have been able
to deal with weaknesses and vulnerabilities in previous networks and
build security improvements into the protocol to ensure that 5G is more
secure. However, that [potential for extra security may not be delivered
by the service providers for cost reasons]{.underline}. Despite
increasing risk, [**not** all manufacturers **prioritize
cybersecurity**]{.underline}. Perhaps [the greatest risk concerns
extension of the **attack surface**. As **connected devices
proliferate** in a **5G environment**, the **threat potential** as well
as **new points of attack increase**]{.underline}. Put simply, [**any
system** is **only as strong** as its **weakest link**: billions of
interconnected devices with varied security]{.underline} also [mean
**billions** of possible **breach points**]{.underline}.60 Given 5G's
edge computing potential, this is a concern for the creators of 5G
infrastructure and networks across Europe.

Most of the attention surrounding the cybersecurity of 5G networks has
focused on supply chain challenges. Chinese companies currently lead in
5G development and Huawei dominates the global market for
telecommunications equipment. In 2019, twothirds of 5G networks outside
China relied on telecom equipment manufactured in China.61 On top of
reported security vulnerabilities -- such as software code deficiencies
or poor oversight of its supplier networks -- which could be exploited
by any malign actor, concerns have also been voiced about Huawei's ties
to the Chinese government and the potential risk that [China might use
5G infrastructure for espionage or illicit actions]{.underline} (such as
intellectual property theft, company sabotage, or fraud).62 The Chinese
State Security Law obliges companies to 'provide assistance with work
related to state security'.63 [If critical communications]{.underline},
including Internet voting, [come to depend on **5G networks**, this will
create a level of insecurity since the Chinese regime might]{.underline}
gain access to and eventually [manipulate such processes]{.underline}.64
The ability to manipulate public opinion, with implications for
democracy, is certainly there, just like it was with 4G. [With
5G]{.underline}, however, [the lack of trust in its architecture,
alongside uncertainties about how the infrastructure operates,
**heightens** some of those **concerns**]{.underline}.

In addition to user profiling and political microtargeting, with the
roll-out of 5G, an increase in the volume and speed of data theft is
expected.65 As confirmed by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), [5G networks will constitute 'an **attractive
target** for **criminals** and **foreign adversaries** to **exploit**
for **valuable info**rmation and **intel**ligence']{.underline}.66

"The race to 5G is on and America must win", President Donald Trump said
in April1 . For political purposes, that "race" has been defined as
which nation gets 5G built first. It is the wrong measurement.

The United States and Europe must "fire first effectively" in their
deployment of 5G. Borrowing on a philosophy Admiral Arleigh Burke coined
in World War II: Speed is important, but speed without a good targeting
solution can be disastrous2.

5G will be a physical overhaul of essential networks that will have
decades-long impact. Because 5G is the conversion to a mostly
all-software network, future upgrades will be software updates much like
the current upgrades to smartphones. [Because of the **cyber
vulnerabilities**]{.underline} of software, [the **tougher part** of the
**real 5G "race"** is **retooling** how to **secure** the most important
network]{.underline} of the XXI century [and the ecosystem]{.underline}
of devices and applications [that sprout from that network]{.underline}.

Beyond the vulnerabilities of software, 5G networks have another
vulnerability: a supply chain that circles the world. From hardware,
software and firmware to the design of the apps and devices using the
network, the 5G supply chain is composed of numerous participants. Each
of these participants rely on the others, but none has cybersecurity as
their core responsibility.

The new capabilities made possible by new applications riding 5G
networks hold tremendous promise. [As the **United States** and
**Europe** pursue the **connected future**]{.underline}, however, [they
must place]{.underline} equivalent -- if not **[greater]{.underline}**
-- [focus on the **security** of those connections, devices, and
applications. To build 5G on top of a **weak cybersecurity foundation**
is to build on **sand**]{.underline}. This is not just a matter of the
safety of network users, [it is a matter of **national security** -- and
a **geopolitical imperative**.]{.underline}

STUTTGART, Germany -- [NATO's technical agency wants to make sure it has
a say in ongoing 5G standardization talks to ensure the critical
technology can be used for **both civilian and military
purposes.**]{.underline}

For Antonio Calderon, interim chief technology officer for the NATO
Communication and Information Agency (NCIA), [fifth-generation wireless
technology has the potential to enable swaths of novel capabilities for
the defensive alliance.]{.underline}

[That's why it's important that NCIA have a voice in ongoing discussions
about 5G standardization,]{.underline} he said in an interview with
Defense News. [If two NATO member nations went into a maritime exercise
with capabilities that used a future, currently hypothetical, NATO 5G
standard, those nations would be able to securely communicate without
the use of a base station.]{.underline}

The agency is in ongoing conversations with industry partners with
connections to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the
umbrella term for a number of organizations that develop protocols for
mobile communications.

"[**We don't have a seat** in that 3GPP]{.underline}, but we can raise
our concerns" with the members, Calderon said. "If we are not part of
that discussion, if we are not around the table, the 5G standards will
be focused on civilian applications."

[That would be a drawback to NATO and its partners]{.underline}, who see
a huge opportunity for 5G to provide next-generation connectivity and
enhanced network management to troops across domains. [Calderon, who
prior to joining NATO worked in the civilian telecommunications
industry, noted that if industry comes up with its own 5G standard
without considering military-specific features, they run the risk of
narrowing their business case.]{.underline}

For the past several years, the agency has been conducting internal
technical assessments to evaluate the potential of 5G for military
applications.

NCIA has pared down its focus from four to two specific applications:
for maritime communications and for deployable communications and
information systems (CIS), Calderon said. Those two applications were
chosen due to the maturity of their technology and their potential in
the civilian domain as well as military, he added.

["Those two already have a mature industry, doing trials and proofs of
concept," he said. "But those two are also the most interesting for NATO
-- it's hand in hand."]{.underline}

The alliance has recently established its own multinational 5G
initiative, with over 10 member-nations currently involved. [The
initiative is in its early stages, and the member nations are
determining how best to contribute to the 5G efforts -- whether
financially, in-kind with experts or engineers, or a
combination.]{.underline}

Calderon said NCIA has currently dedicated funding "in the single
millions" for 5G technologies, but noted that if the 5G initiative
materialized into a "real program," they could dedicate ten times more
funding than that. The agency may also be able to tap into [NATO's
recently established technology
accelerator,](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/06/22/nato-hopes-to-launch-new-defense-tech-accelerator-by-2023/)**[ ]{.underline}**the
Defense Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic (DIANA).

By 2023, NATO hopes for DIANA to have established links with test
centers across its member nations to help validate, test and co-design
emerging and next-generation technologies. "5G could be a good candidate
for one of those defense challenges that maybe DIANA ... could address,"
Calderon said.

[But in the meantime, NATO will continue to work to ensure the military
uses of 5G are taken into account in the civilian development of new
standards, he added.]{.underline}

"Then, the products will have those standards that are really useful ...
and valuable for us," he said.

### NATO Key\-\--1AR

#### NATO key - ensures the US and Europe don't drift, which deters China and means Huawei does not compromise NATO information sharing.

**Larsen '22** (Henrik Larsen, Ph.D., senior researcher at the Center
for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

☺

China does not compare to the direct threat that Russia poses but has
nevertheless appeared on NATO's strategic radar as an economic great
power with a high-tech edge that Russia is unlikely to ever match.
Chinese 5G network provider [Huawei remains a pertinent topic for
NATO]{.underline}, as several [European countries, including Germany,
Austria, Spain, the Netherlands and Hungary, are still undecided about
relying on its potentially compromised technology or de facto allowing
their national operators to use Chinese providers]{.underline}.
Moreover, [Chinese investments in]{.underline} continental [Europe
without conditionalities]{.underline} attached [and targeting critical
infrastructure]{.underline} (railway stations, ports and airports)
[raise suspicions about Beijing's underlying political and military
motives]{.underline}. Moreover, China is pressing ahead with military
applications of artificial intelligence (AI), and its space ambitions
are growing.

Since 2014, NATO has become increasingly aware of the nonmilitary
challenges to its unity and resilience but has adapted only in certain
respects. It adopted the so-called baseline requirements in 2016,
against which it can measure individual allies' level of resilience
regarding their provision of essential services to their domestic
populations. These basics that would be necessary to withstand a crisis
include access to food, water and energy supplies; maintenance of core
functions of government; and resilient civil transportation systems.
However, the baseline requirements are technical measurements that do
not adequately grasp the political nature of the challenges that Russia
and China pose to alliance unity. Moreover, their focus on civil
preparedness, resource management and infrastructure does not seem to
fit squarely within the competencies of a defense alliance. NATO may be
on a slippery slope with the scope of its resilience concept drifting
further away from its defense capabilities.

NATO, as an organization and as an alliance of states, is aware of the
challenges to transatlantic resilience and cohesion that Russia and
China pose, but the alliance has not been able to agree on the issues to
which it can bring added value. The situation today stands in contrast
to the situation during the Cold War when NATO successfully calibrated
resilience to the ability to resist an armed attack by focusing on civil
emergency planning. Russia and China are illiberal challengers that add
new meaning to transatlantic security cooperation, but NATO's adaptation
will depend on the extent to which the United States and Europe can find
agreement on investment in transatlantic security.

U.S. and European Perspectives

From the U.S. perspective, the rise of China compels a harsher foreign
policy prioritization that delegates more responsibilities to European
states. President Biden was elected on the promise of a "foreign policy
for the middle class," which was an effort to win back some of the Trump
voters dissatisfied with the United States paying the bill for
transatlantic defense. The refocus on the U.S. domestic base has so far
manifested itself in the precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan and the
clumsy diplomatic handling of the announcement of the security pact
among Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. These two
decisions give Europeans reason to question the durability of U.S.
leadership beyond President Trump.

It took Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the Biden administration to
play a major role in European security, which has been exercised in
terms of economic sanctions against Russia and arms supplies to Ukraine.
Biden's declaration to his allies that "America is back" after assuming
office had until then yielded little concrete results. Unlike its
predecessor, the Biden administration is not obsessed with numerical
defense spending and understands security more broadly in terms of the
capacity to defend against illiberal threats. Washington expects the
Europeans to be reliable allies in the competition with Russia and
China, but it has not specified which functions it wishes NATO to
perform.

From a European perspective, Russia's invasion of Ukraine marks a new
reality of increased defense spending that will likely redress some of
the military imbalance between the United States and European NATO
allies since the end of the Cold War. It is positive that the United
States seeks cooperation on a wider array of security issues, such as
trade and technology, that are core to a resilient and united
transatlantic alliance. At the same time, it is continental Europe, not
North America and the United Kingdom, that risks emerging as a weak
transatlantic link under growing Russian and Chinese influence and,
therefore, must make the necessary adjustment.

The vagueness of U.S. expectations and the questionable durability of
U.S. leadership seems to give European allies more leverage in defining
the alliance's strategic outlook on resilience. Restricting nontrusted
technology and economic investments and fighting foreign subversion are
mostly national decisions, but the European Union has exclusive powers
with regard to trade and coordinates significant assets in other areas.
The European allies can shape the U.S. push for NATO's functional
expansion by clarifying four areas in which the alliance can add value
to transatlantic resilience.

Four Areas of Adaptation

First, NATO needs to make clear the aspects of resilience for which it
is not placed to lead. As a rule, the more NATO engages the civilian
aspects of security, the more it moves away from its mandate. The
alliance seems to have no natural role in law enforcement---such as
fighting foreign influence operations or weaponized corruption---because
of the variety in allied legislative frameworks and the existence of
other established channels for ordinary police cooperation. NATO may be
able to play a bigger role in coordinating between intelligence services
on counterterrorism (against Russia) and counterintelligence (both
Russia and China). The challenges arising from disinformation are real,
as seen during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but NATO has no role in
countering foreign efforts to undermine public trust in the functioning
of democratic institutions in its allies. The alliance should confine
its anti-disinformation efforts to military affairs and Russian attempts
to depict the alliance as an aggressor and a violator of the agreements
that brought the Cold War to an end.

Second, NATO needs to identify which aspects of resilience it is
positioned to lead. The most pertinent issue seems to be reducing
Russian temptations to destabilize its eastern territory, notably
Estonia and Latvia with significant Russian-speaking minorities, and the
Lithuanian-Polish border toward the Kaliningrad exclave.
Russia-instigated gray zone conflict on NATO territory seems more likely
than a large-scale conventional war, especially given the poor
performance of Russian forces in Ukraine. Russia still prefers to rely
on disinformation and subversion to stir ethnic and political discord
and may also return to using special operations incursions as a
destabilization strategy, as it did during its seizure of Crimea in
2014. NATO needs to deter Russia across multiple domains of warfare by
structuring and training a part of its future forces for gray zone
eventualities that may precede Russia's application of large-scale
kinetic force. Integrating preparations to combat gray zone tactics into
NATO's conventional planning would allow it to implement a stronger,
more crisis-ready resilience concept. NATO's cyber defense capabilities
are obviously relevant against Russian attempts to disrupt allied or
national functions that may precede a conventional attack. And NATO
should also work to deny hostile powers the capacity to neutralize or
jam NATO and reconnaissance satellites.

Third, [NATO must position itself to counter the rise of
China]{.underline}. Although official NATO rhetoric refers to the
protection of the rules-based international order, its mandate centers
geographically on the Euro-Atlantic area and not the Asia-Pacific. Other
than reasserting the general differences between China's autocratic
approach to the use of personal data and public-private relationships
and those of NATO allies, NATO has no role in regulating transatlantic
trade. The [alliance may recognize Chinese]{.underline} acquisitions of
critical infrastructure in Europe as a vulnerability to force mobility
in a crisis, as well as Chinese [5G technology as an obstacle to allied
information-sharing, without pretense to its ability to influence the
economic choices of allied governments.]{.underline} Conversely, NATO
has a distinct role in ensuring interoperability and the development of
common principles for the responsible use of AI and other so-called
emerging and disruptive technologies. NATO allies consider AI valuable
for logistics and intelligence but, unlike China, are opposed to lethal
uses without human authorization. [China's technological advances create
**pressure on NATO to ensure that North America and Europe do not drift
apart** in terms of interoperability and regulatory
approaches]{.underline} to future war technology[.]{.underline} China's
growing capabilities in cyberspace and outer space offer NATO an
additional role in military threat definition and integration into
allied structures and operational procedures.

transportation system providers]{.underline}. Given that security
management will become essential in handling ongoing threats and risks,

VIII\. RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the conclusions above, [we recommend
military **communications stakeholders at NATO** and nations the
following]{.underline}: 1) [Organize a workshop with **military**
communications stakeholders on 5G to discuss ideas, collect inputs, and
synchronize findings]{.underline}. Different communities and teams
across the military communities are looking at the potential and
challenges of 5G from different angles. In this context, [it is
pertinent to organize an informal discussion to synchronize views and
collect inputs to discuss interim results, identified opportunities,
initial reference 5G military scenarios, and collect additional inputs,
to prepare follow-on engagements with other stakeholders including
industry]{.underline}. In this discussion, it is also critical to
involve multiple communities of interest (i.e., **[Cyber]{.underline}**,
Intelligence, Command and Control and Core Services). 2) [Conduct
comprehensive assessments of 5G for military application]{.underline}.
Given the complexity of the topic (see Conclusion 1), the evolving
standardization activities, the different potential implementation
domains and variables, and the immaturity of some 5G features, [the
credible investigation of 5G and related technologies for military
application requires a significant and stable effort to be conducted by
a technical team, which is only possible with a robust and relatively
long-term involvement.]{.underline} 3) [Engage with the military
communications industry to assess the state of the art in 5G
developments and discuss implementation challenges in military
scenarios.]{.underline} The initial reference 5G military scenarios
highlighted in this paper have identified a myriad of implementation
challenges (in \[2\]) for the associated technical concepts on the use
of private or public 5G systems in NATO/military scenarios. In ad-hoc
contacts with 5G industry and operators, the authors also noted a number
of ongoing R&D activities in different laboratories to assess
experimental 5G technologies and applications. Therefore, [it highly
recommended that military representatives and scientists engage with
these communities to obtain first-hand feedback on the implementation
challenges associated with some reference military 5G
scenarios]{.underline}. 4) Publish a technical paper in a credible
military communications conference. In order to facilitate informed
dialogues with stakeholders on military applications/use of 5G
technologies and systems, as well as to raise awareness to the potential
and associated implementation challenges of some concepts, it is key to
bring awareness to the topic and to communicate it to a wide audience.
Publishing a concept paper on the initial opportunities and challenges
of military applications of 5G technologies in the form of a credible
technical paper facilitates this effort and contributes to informed
discussions with a large audience. 5) In assessing the potential of 5G,
assess also the potential of related wireless technologies. 5G is highly
related to other technologies both at the Radio Access Network (RAN) and
at the Data Network levels. Specifically, the 5G RAN has an open
architecture to include the integration with other wireless access
technologies (e.g., LTE Advanced, WLAN technologies, NTN-based 5G). In
turn, some these non-5G wireless technologies4 may bring significant
benefits to some military applications and should be also addressed. 6)
Invest in monitoring, participating and contributing to 3GPP\'s work
plan. As per stated in Conclusion 3, 3GPP is the forum where 5G
requirements and specifications are discussed and agreed. Having
military representatives participating at 3GPP would ensure that
military interests are better represented and would provide the informed
inputs to civil participants interested in military/public safety
applications. [NATO scientists could play this role and **represent
NATO/military** interests]{.underline} at 3GPP. 7) Consider developing a
multi-stakeholder effort to exploit the potential of 5G and other civil
high-performance wireless technologies in support of military
applications. Given the need to conduct significant work to effectively
assess the potential of 5G and related technologies for effective
military applications, [it is recommended that NATO and national
stakeholders concert efforts to achieve tangible results in the field of
military applications of 5G that can be shared between NATO and national
military communities.]{.underline} Many of the initial reference 5G
military scenarios described in this paper deal with NATO and/or
national capability development (5G-based private military systems to
support operations), interoperability (5G augmentation systems for
cost-effective communications interoperability in select scenarios), IT
Infrastructure for NATO/national military users, and/or the use of
public 5G (civil) telecommunications networks by the military. Combining
R&D efforts in this area would achieve critical mass in the effort in a
cost-effective approach aligned with Smart Defence concepts.

### Standards Key\-\--2AC

#### Bans alone are [insufficient]{.underline}\-\--only standard setting solves.

Bruce **Schneier 20**, fellow and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University, 1/20/2020, \"China Isn't the Only
Problem With 5G,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/10/5g-china-backdoor-security-problems-united-states-surveillance/>,
RMax

The [security risks **inherent** in Chinese]{.underline}-made
[5G]{.underline} networking equipment [are easy to
understand]{.underline}. Because [the companies that make the equipment
are **subservient** to the Chinese government, they could be forced to
include **backdoors** in the **hardware** or **software** to give
Beijing **remote access**]{.underline}. Eavesdropping is also a risk,
although efforts to listen in would almost certainly be detectable. More
insidious is the possibility that [Beijing could use its access to
degrade or disrupt **communications services** in]{.underline} the event
of [a **larger geopolitical conflict**]{.underline}. Since the internet,
especially the "internet of things," is expected to rely heavily on 5G
infrastructure, potential [Chinese infiltration is a **serious national
security threat**]{.underline}.

But [keeping [**untrusted
companies**](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/08/08/huawei-is-trying-to-solve-a-hard-problem) like
**Huawei** out of Western infrastructure [**isn't
enough**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/huawei-internet-security.html) to
secure 5G]{.underline}. Neither is banning Chinese microchips, software,
or programmers. [**Security vulnerabilities** in the
**standards**]{.underline}---the [protocols and software for
5G]{.underline}---[ensure that vulnerabilities will **remain**,
regardless of **who provides** the hardware and software]{.underline}.
These insecurities are a result of market forces that prioritize costs
over security and of governments, including the United States, that want
to preserve the option of surveillance in 5G networks. If the United
States is serious about tackling the national security threats related
to an insecure 5G network, it needs to rethink the extent to which it
values corporate profits and government espionage over security.

To be sure, there are significant [security
improvements](https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5G-Security-White-Paper-07-26-19-FINAL.pdf) in
5G over 4G---in encryption, authentication, integrity protection,
privacy, and network availability. But the enhancements aren't enough.

This design dramatically increases the points vulnerable to attack.

The [5G security problems are **threefold**. **First**]{.underline}, the
standards are simply too complex to implement securely. This is true
for [all
software](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html),
but the [5G protocols offer]{.underline} particular
**[difficulties]{.underline}**. Because of how it is designed, the
system blurs the wireless portion of the network connecting phones with
base stations and the core portion that routes data around the world.
Additionally, [much of the network is **virtualized**]{.underline},
meaning that [it will rely on software running on dynamically
configurable hardware. This design]{.underline} dramatically
[**increases** the points **vulnerable to attack**]{.underline}, as does
the expected massive increase in both things connected to the network
and the data flying about it.

[**Second**, there's]{.underline} so much [**backward compatibility**
built into the 5G network that **older vulnerabilities
remain**]{.underline}. 5G is an evolution of the decade-old 4G network,
and most networks will mix generations. Without the ability to do a
clean break from 4G to 5G, it will simply be impossible to improve
security in some areas. [Attackers may be able to **force 5G systems**
to use **more vulnerable 4G protocols**]{.underline}, for example, and
5G networks
will [inherit](https://gcn.com/articles/2019/10/21/5g-security.aspx) many
existing problems.

[**Third**, the 5G standards committees missed **many opportunities** to
improve **security**]{.underline}. Many of [the new **security
features** in 5G are **optional**, and network operators can choose not
to implement them]{.underline}. The
same [happened](https://www.wired.com/story/5g-more-secure-4g-except-when-not/) with
4G; operators even ignored security features defined as mandatory in the
standard because implementing them was expensive. But even worse, for
5G, development, performance, cost, and time to market were all
prioritized over security, which was treated as an afterthought.

[Already problems are being **discovered**]{.underline}. In November
2019,
researchers [published](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/5g-flaws-locations-spoof-alerts/) [vulnerabilities](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6544575-5GReasoner.html) that
allow 5G users to be tracked in real time, be sent fake emergency
alerts, or be disconnected from the 5G network altogether. And this
wasn't the
first [reporting](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-19/Wednesday/us-19-Shaik-New-Vulnerabilities-In-5G-Networks-wp.pdf) to [find](https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/pub/2019/kim_sp_2019.pdf) [issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10360) in
5G protocols and implementations.

## Country PICs

### Country PIC\-\--2AC

#### [Unity]{.underline} is key, otherwise [disaster]{.underline} ensues.

Lindsay **Gorman 19**, Fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy,
12/3/2019, \"NATO Should Count Spending on Secure 5G Towards Its 2%
Goals,\" Defense One,
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/12/nato-should-count-secure-5g-spending-towards-its-2-goals/161648/>,
RMax

**[Disunity]{.underline}** here [has real consequences]{.underline}. [A
**split** over **cybersecurity** and the varying presence of "untrusted"
suppliers from China in member countries' **5G networks** threatens
**vital NATO military** and **intelligence cooperation**. The United
States has]{.underline} already [warned]{.underline} that [it will limit
intelligence sharing if allies build 5G networks with Chinese
equipment]{.underline}. In the words of one official, "the Americans
will assume that everything we share with Germany will end up with the
Chinese."

[Such an outcome would be **disastrous** for the **alliance**. A NATO
intelligence-sharing rift would open the door to greater authoritarian
interference in Western democracies]{.underline}, and not just from
China. [NATO's **intelligence sharing** and threat analysis cell is a
central tenet of its plan to combat **hybrid threats** from Russia and
others: **disinformation campaigns**, **malign financial flows**, the
**annexation of Crimea**, and more]{.underline}. Given Russia's
long-standing goal of fracturing NATO, it's no coincidence that Russian
state media champions Huawei.

### Country PIC\-\--1AR

#### Alliance-wide [coordination]{.underline} across [all-members]{.underline} is key.

Berlin's choice will also have implications [for NATO]{.underline}. With
[Germany seeking to shore up and [encourage America's
recommitment](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-s-foreign-minister-on-the-future-of-trans-atlantic-relations-a-68d28367-ae98-4785-bebf-6dbad3990b26) to
the organisation]{.underline}, the decisive indecisiveness it has
adopted on Huawei is a step backwards in re-engaging with Washington.
[On 5G, leading **NATO members** like the US and Germany **should be
championing efforts to ensure** uninterrupted **interoperability**
through bloc-wide standards and minimum network security
requirements]{.underline}. This [coordination from the outset is
necessary because 5G will [give the alliance new
opportunities](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/nato-must-move-out-smartly-5g/167687/) for
data- and intelligence-sharing as well as allowing it to take advantage
of new technologies based on advances in artificial intelligence and
machine learning.]{.underline} But with advanced network connectivity
comes heightened network vulnerability, and [**NATO can only realise
the** full **potential of 5G if there is coordination across all member
countries.**]{.underline}

With this draft law, Berlin has effectively punted down the road a
definitive decision on 5G. How the legislation will look in its final
form remains to be seen, but Berlin's preference for Beijing's tech over
Brussels' wishes is clear. [Should the German government fail to take
concrete action to block Huawei from its networks, the new law will put
Germany at odds with key allies]{.underline} on an issue that has deep
implications for security, defence, and the economy.

[The development of]{.underline} fifth generation ([5G) wireless

technology represents a **leap forward** in the **speed and volume of

Recommendation #2 suggests that [China will have a **great advantage**
if it is the **first** to deliver 5G infrastructure and devices
**globally**, gaining **first-mover advantage**]{.underline}. The DIB
reports that ["first-mover advantage is **particularly pronounced** in
wireless generation transitions because the leader can **set the
foundational infrastructure** and specifications for **all future
products**."]{.underline}\[30\] Many countries will already be beholden
to Chinese products when establishing 5G wireless technology networks
due to component price and availability of components, as well as
compatibility with proprietary interfaces of their current 4G
infrastructures or network devices sourced from China.\[31\] [Chinese
companies such as **Huawei** and ZTE Corporation present **critical
security risks** as they are **state-owned enterprises** linked to the
government.]{.underline} [This has the potential to create a global
information technology (IT) infrastructure **susceptible** to Chinese
predatory practices, such as **i**ntellectual **p**roperty **theft** and
Chinese-mandated technology transfers creating many **security
vulnerabilities**]{.underline}.\[32\] [China's government has
usurped]{.underline} physical and intellectual [property]{.underline},
[creating an advantage in the information space by **exploiting data**
through creating **back door vulnerabilities** within hardware and/or
software]{.underline}. In 2019, [many Chinese IT companies were
implicated in nefarious **cyber activities** and **directly linked** to
China's government]{.underline}.\[33\] This linkage can arguably be
considered part of the culture as Chinese Law Articles 14 and 17
(National Intelligence Law, enacted June 27, 2017) indicate that
[Chinese companies have an **active role** in **supplying information**
and/or access to the state]{.underline}.\[34\] [This culture has
provided]{.underline} state-sponsored [leverage to make China a peer
**competitor**]{.underline} and adversary [of the US]{.underline}, at
large, not just DoD. Security [**Security standards** provide the
**basic parameters** to create a **secure environment** across 5G
wireless networks and are **vital** to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of US data as it traverses through
information networks]{.underline}. To protect US data and systems,
several [**improvements** to current systems need to be
pursued]{.underline}, including policy changes to ensure only secure
equipment is used in USG systems, the development of quantum-resistant
cryptography, improvement of software-defined networking technologies,
and tighter controls over supply chain management. All these changes
must be carefully orchestrated to work in concert with each other across
all government agencies and industry partners. Policy and implementation
of cryptographic standards are required for global security. US policy
protections restrict companies that are non-compliant with current IT
security standards from providing equipment for the 5G infrastructure;
however, the same standards do not apply to allied countries.\[35\]
These cryptographic standards are being developed by NIST under the U.S.
Department of Commerce for use by non-national security federal
information systems. Though these systems are for non-national security
systems, they could be reviewed or adjusted for applicability to
national security systems or critical infrastructure, as well.\[36\]
Smart design of the 5G infrastructure to use these new cryptographic
standards would ensure that over the next decade, as the US experience
with 5G wireless technology increases and its security is improved, the
risk of information theft and unintended decryption remains low. A
primary issue is finding a standard that will not impose excessive
latency, thereby reducing the benefit of using the new 5G wireless
technology. Regardless of the security approaches taken, [the US should
ensure persistent **research and development efforts** in security and
resilience for the network while operating both in the US and
**internationally**]{.underline}. Resilience [Deliberate USG planning
and action must be taken to ensure **resilience**]{.underline} when
using 5G wireless systems. [Two required actions to ensure a
cyber-resilient methodology for US 5G wireless systems are:]{.underline}
(1) [develop better capabilities to **observe anomalies** or attacks in
**real time**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} (2[) improve the ability
for cyber defenders to **act** at the speed of relevance]{.underline}.
[USG systems must be able to **determine** that an attack, malicious
event, or exploitation is in progress to take **timely actions** to
ensure **system resilience**]{.underline}. To identify early warning of
an anomaly or attack, [US entities must understand their standard
day-to-day environment, sense that something is out of the ordinary, and
determine what is happening across the digital
domain]{.underline}.\[37\] Additionally, [**as DoD implements
equipment** that can leverage the 5G wireless infrastructure, **military
communications operators** need to be **trained** and have the right
**tools to detect outside influence**.]{.underline} [Once an attack is
identified, the more **difficult task** is **attributing** the activity
to a malicious actor and then identifying the attack
vector.]{.underline} [To accomplish this, **DoD should improve training
programs** for its cyber warriors and **develop tools that can detect
anomalies** and potentially take the first steps in **countering**
cyber-attacks]{.underline}. [To]{.underline} help [identify attack
vectors and determine where an attack came from,]{.underline} **[new
authorities]{.underline}** or adjustment to current authorities [may be
required]{.underline}, **[especially]{.underline}** [if autonomous
actions are incorporated into these systems]{.underline}. [Once a
malicious act is identified, **military operators** must take timely
action to stop the event.]{.underline} Finding or [**identifying the
attack vector** and **stopping the inflow** or outflow of data through
system manipulation are **key**]{.underline}. [To ensure **resilience**,
**military operators** should be able to **switch** between 5G wireless
and other secure wireless standards as **seamlessly** as
possible.]{.underline}\[38\] Regardless of the standards, [the key to
resilience is having the ability to **continue combat operations** with
or without an available network]{.underline}, albeit with reduced
functionality[.]{.underline} [DoD should **continue practicing** and
**exercising scenarios** either to **maneuver** or determine **alternate
means** to remain **combat-effective** in contested, degraded, or denied
electromagnetic spectrum environments. These **competitive
environments** in which the cyber domain is **contested** are where
**victory in the next war** will most likely be determined.]{.underline}

### DOD Key\-\--Ext

#### Having a [clear]{.underline} 5G focus in the DoD is key.

**Scharre & Riikonen '20** \[Paul and Ainikki, 11-17-2020, \"Defense
Technology Strategy,\" Center for a New American Security,
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/defense-technology-strategy>,
St. Mark's, AM\]

[Technology always has been an **integral** part of]{.underline}
achieving **[military superiority]{.underline}**. A stone axe or wooden
club gave a Neolithic fighter a major advantage over an unarmed
opponent. [As weapons have evolved]{.underline} from bows and arrows to
intercontinental ballistic missiles, [militaries continuously have
sought to **harness** new technologies to **gain an edge**]{.underline}
on adversaries. Technology alone rarely conveys a decisive advantage,
but [technology is an enabler for military superiority]{.underline}.
When combined with the right organization, training, and concepts for
warfighting, technological advantages can make battles hopelessly
one-sided affairs. By harnessing advances in stealth, GPS, and
precision-guided weapons, the United States dismantled Saddam Hussein's
army during the Persian Gulf War with a 30-to-1 casualty ratio.1 Yet
[other countries]{.underline} took notice and have been investing in
capabilities that [have eroded America's military technological
edge]{.underline}.

The United States had a first-mover advantage in the information
revolution, but the technology that enabled American military dominance
in 1991 now has proliferated. Adversaries have invested in long-range
ballistic and cruise missiles that can target American bases and
carriers with precision, integrated air defenses to hold stealth
aircraft at bay, counter-space weapons to blind military spy satellites
and disrupt command-and-control, and cyber weapons to cripple logistics.
This suite of capabilities, sometimes lumped under the label
"anti-access/area denial," is meant to hamper America's ability to
project power overseas, buying time for adversaries to change conditions
on the ground through force. [The United States must
transform]{.underline} its way of warfighting to project combat power in
the face of these [capabilities so the United States can
**deter**]{.underline} and, if necessary, defeat military aggression by
potential [adversaries]{.underline}.

Senior [Defense Department leaders have looked to **new
tech**nologies]{.underline}, from artificial intelligence (AI) to
hypersonic missiles[, to reinvigorate the U.S. **military's
technological edge** vis-à-vis **great power competitors**]{.underline}.
To do so, [the **U**nited **S**tates will need to adopt a technology
strategy appropriate for today's]{.underline} technology
[landscape]{.underline}. The approach the United States used in the
1960s, '70s, and '80s won't work today, when innovation is increasingly
globalized and driven by the private sector. Nor does the U.S. military
have sufficient resources to invest in every conceivable technology,
even with a \$700 billion-plus defense budget. [The]{.underline}
Department of Defense (**[DoD]{.underline}**) [will have to make
**strategic bets**]{.underline} [in the technologies **most likely to
rapidly transform warfare**]{.underline}, while hedging against surprise
with smaller bets elsewhere.

[U.S. defense leaders have sent **conflicting signals** about their
tech]{.underline}nology [priorities]{.underline}. In 2014,
then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel launched the Defense Innovation
Initiative to develop a "game-changing third 'offset' strategy."2
Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work subsequently named AI and
autonomy the "technological sauce" to empower this Third Offset
Strategy.3 But [defense leaders]{.underline} since then [have offered
**shifting** and]{.underline} at times **[conflicting]{.underline}**
[guidance on new technology priorities]{.underline}. Recent
Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E))
Michael Griffin publicly [listed]{.underline} his [top "priority
technology domains" but amended the list]{.underline} approximately
**[four times]{.underline}** between its initial release in April 2018
and his departure in July 2020. [These priorities
fluctuated]{.underline} in number and order; they ranged from 10 **[to
13 priorities]{.underline}** [with AI, hypersonics, nuclear
modernization, and other tech]{.underline}nologies [rotating up and down
in importance]{.underline}. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper remarked at
his confirmation hearing that "Different people put different things at
number one; \[for\] me, it is artificial intelligence."4 Yet the Fiscal
Year 2021 Defense Wide Review issued under then-Secretary Esper's
leadership characterized nuclear modernization as "the highest
modernization priority."5 A few months later in April 2020, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering for Modernization Mark Lewis stated in
an interview, "my number one technology priority is actually
microelectronics."6 With Griffin's departure, the new Acting USD(R&E)
Michael Kratsios [identified "microelectronics, **5G**, hypersonics, and
AI" as tech]{.underline}nology [priorities]{.underline} at his first
public event, [along with "quantum computing]{.underline} . . . and
other industries of the future."7 In total, [five different defense
leaders have articulated an **ever-shifting** array of]{.underline}
technology [priorities]{.underline} over the last several years with AI,
hypersonics, nuclear modernization, and microelectronics all occupying
the top spot as the "number one" priority at different times.

[DoD leaders' attempts to]{.underline} publicly
[communicate]{.underline} their technology priorities are commendable,
but the manner in which they recently [have]{.underline} done so has
[been **chaotic**, confusing, and counterproductive]{.underline}. [The
DoD needs a **coherent technology strategy** to equip itself for
long-term technology competition]{.underline}. [The current approach, in
which DoD priorities]{.underline} whipsaw [based on the whims of senior
leaders, jeopardizes budgetary **stability**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} likely [consumes undue **time and effort** within the
department]{.underline}. Esper's observation that "different people put
different things at number one" is precisely the problem.8 Senior
leaders are entitled to their views, [but a technology strategy that
changes every time there is a turnover in leadership creates
**uncertainty**]{.underline} [and undermines the department's ability to
make **long-term investments**]{.underline}.

Rather than a personality-driven approach, [the DoD needs a transparent
framework for identifying technology priorities that will **provide
clarity and stability** in the department's priorities]{.underline}. [If
DoD leaders offer a transparent rationale for which technologies matter,
they are **more likely** to gain necessary **support from legislators**,
the rest of the department, and **private industry** to achieve
technology objectives]{.underline}. [Clear priorities are **especially
critical** now, given budgetary competition from]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic and the reality that the Pentagon is no
longer the primary driver of American technological innovation. [The

Challenge

[The]{.underline} ongoing [migration to 5G]{.underline} technologies
[creates]{.underline} multifaceted [**opportunities** and **risks**. The
central challenge for DoD is to accelerate the development and
deployment of 5G]{.underline}-enabled capabilities, [while **ensuring**
those systems --- as well as those of our **allies**]{.underline} and
partners --- [are **robust**, **protected**, **resilient**, and
reliable]{.underline}.

[Accelerating the transition to 5G is **challenged** by key
**standards**, **security** principles, and spectrum
policies]{.underline} that are [still in development]{.underline}.
Historically, DoD has not engaged with the governance bodies that set
mobile wireless industry standards. The international allocation of
spectrum for 5G use and the best policies for sharing spectrum among
multiple users also continues to be debated. Numerous reviews regarding
5G exports, foreign investment, and technology control measures are
still underway. Related factors impacting the cost and speed of 5G
deployment include industrial policy, fair market access, and government
incentives. [Ensuring that DoD can operate in a **global 5G
environment** is challenging because potential U.S. adversaries seek to
**dominate** the 5G market in **key partner nations**, which could
allow]{.underline} such competitors to gain unauthorized network and
data access via [exploited components in the supply chain, malicious
software, and]{.underline}/or [insider threats]{.underline}. Given the
complexity of 5G infrastructure, even inadvertent vulnerabilities may be
very difficult to detect and prevent. Finally, [adversaries could
leverage]{.underline} control of the [5G]{.underline} market [to advance
security and foreign policy goals that ultimately undermine U.S.
interests.]{.underline}

Because 5G networks will transport massive amounts of sensitive
personal, corporate, and government information, they are particularly
attractive targets for potential U.S. adversaries. With persistent
access to an ally's 5G network, [an adversary could]{.underline}
potentially [engage in widespread espionage, threaten the privacy and
rights of citizens globally, prepare the operational environment to
provide an advantage in armed conflict, conduct information operations,
and]{.underline}/or [disrupt critical infrastructure]{.underline}. For
these reasons, [5G]{.underline} networks [must incorporate suitable
protections. The U.S. Government also encourages allies and partners to
**prioritize security considerations**]{.underline} [by avoiding
untrusted and unreliable suppliers for their 5G networks]{.underline},
even [as DoD seeks to be prepared to operate in all network
environments]{.underline}.

[Only a robust, in-depth approach to 5G security can address the full
range of hardware, software, and human-factor risks, while posturing the
DoD to **fully leverage** 5G-enabled capabilities]{.underline}

#### Security cooperation is [key]{.underline}.

International Allies and Partners

[**DoD must collaborate** closely with the State Department to
utilize]{.underline} upcoming bilateral and [**multilateral dialogues**
to discuss 5G concerns with international partners. **DoD must convey**
to allies]{.underline} and partners [the **risks** to their national
security equities --- mobilization, interoperability, information
sharing, operations, and resilience against coercion --- to **quickly**
address them before mitigations become far costlier. The matter is
**urgent**]{.underline}, as many [nations are]{.underline} already
[auctioning 5G spectrum and making **long-term investments** in 5G
infrastructure]{.underline}. It is important that the United States
promotes a shared understanding of the importance of 5G protection and
the serious threat posed by unauthorized foreign access. The Prague
Proposals on 5G security and the National Strategy to Secure 5G provide
a helpful basis for framing this issue, specifically noting that \"the
overall risk of influence on a supplier by a third country should be
taken into account\".

[The decisions made by our allies]{.underline} and partners [about
5G]{.underline} deployment often [involve senior government and industry
leaders who may not view telecommunications infrastructure as a
**national security issue**. DoD **must** ensure that foreign
counterparts **understand** the risk 5G threats and vulnerabilities pose
to **interoperability** and **industrial security** so they can
**accurately communicate** the message across their governments. This
requires DoD to provide a clear **national security-based rationale**
concerning the risk of 5G vendors beholden to foreign
governments.]{.underline}

Some [states continue to seek to undermin]{.underline}e fair and open
[international competition for 5G]{.underline} equipment and services
via diplomatic pressure, misleading reporting, market manipulations,
state-backed financing, and/or other aggressive interventions. The
United States is confronting such tactics directly and ensuring that our
allies and partners are aware of ties between foreign suppliers and
their governments\' security organizations. [DoD will
support]{.underline} these [national-level efforts by collaborating with
the global community to identify 5G security vulnerabilities and share
relevant **threat intelligence** with DoD **counterparts**]{.underline}.

In order to influence significant upcoming decisions[, DoD **must**
develop clear, prioritized outcomes for **international engagement** and
ensure DoD military, political, and industry outreach is **aligned** in
support of those outcomes. This will include positive messaging about
opportunities to collaborate with the United States on 5G research,
standards, and deployment.]{.underline}

#### 5G improves military performance 

Scott **Maucione 22**, (Federal News Network Staff, has worked in
journalism for over a decade. He previously covered the Pentagon for
Inside Defense. 2-1-2022, \"5G is changing the way the military connects
its bases and its people,\" Federal News Network,
<https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-insights/2022/02/federal-insights-smart-base-of-the-future/>
) /billy

As 5G begins to roll out in civilian and military spaces, the [Defense
Department]{.underline} is testing 5G networks at a handful of bases to
ensure connectivity and security.

Since last year, the Pentagon has had contracts [for 5G
experimentation]{.underline} at nearly a dozen different installations
to make "smart bases."

"In essence, [a **smart base**]{.underline} of the future is the
integration of connected technologies that [will **fundamentally
improve** the **performance** and efficiency of assets and services
**across a military** installation]{.underline}," said Cornelius Brown,
Verizon's Department of Defense sales director, during the Federal
Insights discussion Smart Base of the Future, sponsored by Verizon. "As
we define [smart bases, we can essentially view them as mini cities in
itself, where infrastructure, building transportation, energy
management, are all factors of a city and a base]{.underline}. What
drives a smart base is that they're all hyper connected, it's an
ecosystem where everything becomes connected."

That kind of system is what the [Pentagon is aiming for when it comes to
its future weapons systems]{.underline}, [artificial
intelligence]{.underline} and how it wants everything to be
interconnected with data and interoperability.

["There's a large collaboration with multiple industry
players]{.underline} to really enable various use cases around energy
management, drone management, **[autonomous vehicles]{.underline}**, and
it's really a collaborative effort to really prove out what the customer
wants to accomplish," Brown said. "5G brings mobile edge computing
closer to the end user, or the application via the cloud. This really
removes a lot of historical latency that prevented us from applications
being able to make near real time decisions."

It's not just the Pentagon's weapons systems that will see changes with
5G. [Military personnel will also see their connected lives move in a
different direction as well.]{.underline}

"For military personnel living on the base, [they'll be able to take an
**autonomous shuttle** or bus that will get them around]{.underline},
all that cool stuff," Bryan Schromsky, a managing partner for 5G public
sector at Verizon said. "More importantly they'll see it in connection.
If they're using a video calling platform on these connected devices,
they'll just have a much better experience. They'll be in [**high
def**inition **video**]{.underline}, they'll have [faster bit
rates]{.underline}, so they can do more videos. They can upload
information, all of that good stuff and couldn't ask for much more to
have a very intimate and immersive experience in a personal way."

With that new power and ease also comes new responsibilities and
challenges, however.

By adding more devices to the network, it creates more opportunities for
malicious actors to get into the network[. DoD will need to protect its
assets from outside attacks like hackers and inside attacks like a
faulty supply chain]{.underline}.

"[Having a **coordinated security policy** is the right
approach]{.underline} ," Schromsky said. "We want to make sure we have a
valid, secure supply chain and also work with industry standards. Most
importantly we want to have outreach in working with public sector
agencies, federal, state and local to make sure that we meet their needs
and their challenges."

[DoD will need to rely on **future technologies** as 5G develops to
better security measures]{.underline}.

Schromsky said quantum computing will have a large role to play in
encryption and not only making military bases safe, but also securing
financial transactions and personal data

### DOD Key\-\--NSA\-\--2AC

#### Interoperability and standardization is key\-\--NSA has authority and expertise

Lauren C. **Williams 22** (Senior editor for FCW and Defense Systems,
covering defense and cybersecurity. 3-10-2022, \"5G has military promise
but security concerns are still being untangled,\" FCW,
https://fcw.com/defense/2022/03/5g-has-military-promise-security-concerns-are-still-being-untangled/363003/)/billy

[5G offers a number of promising defense applications, particularly when
it comes to training on modernized ranges, but **security standards**
still need to be worked out **to get the right authorities** to
operate.]{.underline} Neal Ziring, technical director for the National
Security Agency, said that [using 5G for military and national security
applications requires **interoperable** and **secure standards** and
**policies** because they will define how capabilities **work
together**]{.underline}. "In my mind, [the critical aspect
will]{.underline} not [be]{.underline} 5G itself -- and that's going to
be important -- but understanding [how we integrate with
it.]{.underline} So if the standards can have security in them, which
they're starting to have...we can ask the carriers from whom we procure
commercial service or commercially operated private service \[to\] turn
on those security features," Ziring said at an AFCEA DC event March 9.
"How do we integrate our services, whether it\'s [tactical services or
facilities services or training services, to ride over that network in
such a way that we know what security guarantees the 5G network itself
provides to us and which ones we have to provide as an application
service that sits on top]{.underline}?" he asked. Ziring said that would
be a crucial question to answer when providing real-time services to a
mobile, edge computing environment, which isn't well standardized yet:
"They're all very virtualized and containerized; that's an area that's
still a challenge in some quarters for \[an authority to operate\] at
all." Ziring said [the NSA is working with the services and the Defense
Information Systems Agency to work out specifications and policy that
everyone can use instead of coming up with their own]{.underline}.
"We're looking forward to doing that, but it's going to be a lot of work
over the next two, three years to get to that point," he said. One of
the concepts the NSA is exploring, he said, is the idea of network
slicing in which service providers set up independent logical networks
across 5G infrastructure, which will be crucial for defense applications
of the technology. This means that certain devices (or vehicles) and
their authorized users would be designated for a particular network
slice with the needed security protections[.]{.underline} [NSA is
working on what the security should be for these slices and the
integration risks between cloud and 5G infrastructures.]{.underline} "5G
is already being deployed; we're already having pilots. But I think it's
going to be very important to share security practices and experience as
we start rolling these out," Ziring said. It's critical that we don't
keep that secret to ourselves, that we share that so we all improve," he
said.

## EU CP

### EU CP\-\--2AC

#### EU policy backfires and only NATO solves.

RMax

By late 2020, at least 53 countries had joined the U.S.-led Clean
Network initiative, which also was highlighted by the
**[EU]{.underline}** as having synergies with its own 5G cybersecurity
toolbox, a set of measures adopted to guarantee the security of 5G
within EU member states.8 Even though the **[5G toolbox]{.underline}**
addresses the same security issues and specifies strategic tools to
mitigate principal cybersecurity risks, it [does **not** set out **full
unified and detailed regulation** for countries within the EU. It simply
suggests a **general framework**]{.underline} and points out where
member states could take specific individual measures to protect their
5G networks.

Cooperation between EU member states in the field of security is still
insignificant and so national security issues such as 5G security
measures have to be resolved at the national level. Countries are under
considerable pressure both from internal demand for services and the
suppliers themselves to make commitments to specific suppliers and
decide who they will be technologically dependent on for the foreseeable
future. Because these decisions have to be made at the national level,
this has turned individual member states into battlefields for
technological influence.

Germany's hesitation and continued discussions with Huawei about the
company's participation in its 5G rollout raised a lot of concerns, but
eventually Germany issued legislation in May allowing the government to
block "untrustworthy" suppliers. 9 That same month, Italy approved
Vodaphone's decision to continue its cooperation with Huawei and its
participation in the development of its 5G network.10

These events demonstrate that even though most EU countries have taken
specific action to secure their 5G networks, [we **cannot** expect to
see a **unified EU approach** to Chinese telecommunication companies
anytime soon and this may cause **disunity** within the **EU**.
**However**, 5G]{.underline} should not only be considered a national
security matter, it [must be seen as a **grave security issue** for
**NATO**. Future **military** solutions will potentially rely on
**commercial 5G solutions**. The protection of essential networks from
the influence of potential adversaries should be a **critical strategic
goal** for **NATO**]{.underline}.

Strong, modern telecommunications infrastructure capable of intercepting

deliver on its key mission of collective defense. Yet, this
[**infrastructure in Europe** is largely **privately owned,** and as
such is left **exposed to** the risk of external **interference** and

aspects if not clearly regulated by law. Russia is]{.underline} no

tactics on NATO territory: China, too,]{.underline} has been [using
various sophisticated political and non-military tactics to advance its
political and economic influence]{.underline}. In the face of these

NATO's tools for responding to the China challenge

A decade ago[, discussions about a forum for NATO conversations on China
centered on the idea of a NATO-China Council]{.underline}, analogous to
the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), a structured dialogue between the
alliance and Moscow initially designed [to ease the impact of NATO's
enlargement]{.underline} into Central and Eastern Europe on the West's
relations with Russia.23 [But the experience of the NATO-Russia Council
demonstrates the limits of such a body]{.underline}; while presumably it
should be important as a crisis management mechanism during a major
conflict, the [NRC failed to perform that role during the 1999 Kosovo
war,]{.underline} when Russia suspended its participation in the NRC's
predecessor, the Permanent Joint Council,24 and during the 2008
Russia-Georgia war, when NATO declared it could not "continue with
business as usual" in the NRC.25 NATO proceeded to "\[suspend\] all
practical cooperation" with Russia after the latter's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, despite seeking to keep a channel for dialogue open.26

[While a forum for NATO-China discussions could prove useful beyond the
military-military staff talks that have been held previously, NATO needs
an internal alliance forum to help member states develop greater
cohesion in responding to the myriad challenges that Beijing poses,
namely in areas like **5G**]{.underline} and artificial intelligence.27
In their report, the NATO reflection group suggested forming a
"consultative body modeled on the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls" that operated during the Cold War.28
CoCom, as it was known, was a voluntary mechanism with no formal
enforcement procedures that enabled allied conversations to develop
joint policies restricting the exports of sensitive technologies to the
Soviet Union, China, and other Eastern bloc nations.29

[The Cold War fear of keeping advanced Western technology]{.underline}
out of the hands of the Soviet Union [was a **different challenge** than
the current concern that Chinese technologies will prove attractive to
Western nations]{.underline}, [giving Beijing the ability to
**infiltrate** targets and inhibit operations during a
crisis.]{.underline} To develop a common assessment of the threat China
poses to building common approaches to technology investments within
allied nations[, the **internal NATO forum30** could serve as a platform
to support key bodies such as the European Union, which will play a more
important role than NATO in European decisionmaking on technology
investment.]{.underline}31

[**NATO** countries need to guard **against** falling prey to **China's
divide** and conquer strategy facilitated through Beijing's own
institutional mechanisms such as the Belt and Road
Initiative]{.underline}32 (BRI) that China has pursued in Europe ---
primarily through the 16+1/17+1 format that includes countries
throughout Central and Eastern Europe --- and Beijing's bilateral
economic relations with European countries.33 (In 2019, Italy signed a
Memorandum of Understanding to join the BRI, becoming the first G-7
country to do so.34) In one notable example of China's economic power
fracturing cohesion among democratic states, [Athens blocked an EU
statement criticizing China's human rights abuses in the United Nations
Human Rights Council just months after the state-owned China Ocean
Shipping Company bought a 51% stake in Greece's largest
port,]{.underline} Piraeus.35

Coordination on technology investment decisions requires building
stronger NATO-EU and U.S.-EU ties. In May 2021, the EU agreed to include
Canada, Norway, and the United States in the Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO) Military Mobility project, an important sign for
future U.S.-EU defense cooperation.36 Building on a European Commission
proposal,37 the United States and European Union at their June 2021
summit announced the creation of a U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council
to set joint standards on new technologies, "with the aim of promoting a
democratic model of digital governance."38 This council, which convened
for the first time in September 2021, fits into a broader effort by the
Commission to set forth an EU-U.S. agenda, creating a common framework
for technology governance to ensure "secure 5G infrastructure across the
globe and open a dialogue on 6G... part of wider cooperation on digital
supply chain security done through objective risk-based assessments."39
Others have proposed a NATO-EU collaboration to establish an AI Center
of Excellence that would more proactively address Chinese advances in
artificial intelligence.40

[NATO has a ready-made **framework** for working with **Indo-Pacific
partners** through its global partnership program,]{.underline} which
includes Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, among other
nations.41 Foreign ministers from these four partners met at the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) in December 2020 for the first time, and the NAC
should hold such meetings on a regular basis to strengthen ties between
NATO members and key U.S. democratic allies in Asia. The NATO 2030
expert group has suggested that NATO also seek a future partnership with
India.42

[Chinese deployments in the Euro-Atlantic area and increasing
European]{.underline} (primarily U.K. and French) [deployments in the
Indo-Pacific will result in greater needs and opportunities for
connectivity among U.S. allies across regions]{.underline}. Former U.S.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Policy Ian
Brzezinski has suggested that NATO could establish a small military
headquarters in the Pacific through United States Pacific Command
(PACOM) to help coordinate allied deployments in the region.43 [One way
to begin building more multilateral interoperability in the Indo-Pacific
would be to build a defense college for civilian and military leaders in
the region similar to the NATO Defense College in Rome]{.underline}.44
Such a college could include not just officers and political staff from
America's Asian allies but could serve to bring Europeans together with
their Asian counterparts.

The accelerating importance of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or
Quad (made up of the Indo-Pacific powers Australia, India, Japan, and
the United States), along with formats like the FranceIndia-Australia
trilateral forum, creates opportunities for the U.S. and its allies to
strengthen ties with India.45 The United States has long worked closely
with the U.K., France, and Germany in a NATO Quad on matters of
significance for the transAtlantic area. Under U.S. leadership[, a Quad
plus Quad arrangement could bring key American allies plus one key
non-allied security partner, India, together from Europe and the
Indo-Pacific, and is a natural outgrowth of the NATO global partnership
mechanism.]{.underline} Such conversations would primarily be political
in nature, as key allies from these two regions could discuss the
growing challenges that China poses. A Quad plus Quad arrangement might
also help ease the tensions with France that erupted with the
announcement of the AUKUS trilateral security pact and submarine deal
between the U.S., U.K., and Australia in September 2021.46

[**International Partnership** Is **Key** to **5G
Security**]{.underline} and Competitiveness

[The market for **telecommunications infrastructure** is
**global**]{.underline} and shaped by high capital costs and economies
of scale. [The **United States** should work with **allies** and
**like-minded countries** to promote **international norms** that enable
**secure**, **trusted**]{.underline}, and diversified [**5G supply
chains** that will facilitate **greater global adoption** of 5G and **5G
network infrastructures**]{.underline}.

[**Partnership** is the key to **supply chain trust** and]{.underline}
to [**5G cybersecurity**. Developing a **common approach** to 5G creates
**opportunity** for **cooperation on cybersecurity** among Western
democracies. This]{.underline} common [approach could identify **common
measures** to mitigate]{.underline} the main [**cybersecurity risks** of
5G networks, provide advice, and **share intel**ligence]{.underline} on
how to do this. One starting point is the European Union's 2019
Coordinated Risk Assessment on Cybersecurity in 5G Networks, which
identified threats and threat actors and vulnerabilities, including
vulnerabilities created by the legal and policy frameworks of third
countries. In 2020, the European Union endorsed a joint "toolbox" of
mitigating measures agreed by EU member states to address 5G security
risks. This European initiative, in which the United States was
involved, provides a starting point for further collaboration on
cybersecurity as 5G technology evolves.

[Cooperation in countering predatory practices and in
cybersecurity,]{.underline} aligning and coordinating trade promotion
policies, [and collaboration in protecting standards processes point to
the **need** to **work with allies**. The **basis** for **renewed
cooperation** is the shared values of the **transatlantic community**.
These values are]{.underline} now [under threat from]{.underline}
powerful and ambitious [authoritarian regimes]{.underline}, and a
growing concern over [their behavior offers the United States an
**opportunity** to build a **new approach** to **technological
security**]{.underline}, including [in **5G**, with European
nations]{.underline} and Asian democracies. [The United States should
**work with allied countries** to establish **international norms** that
enable a **secure**, **trusted**, and diversified **5G supply
chain**]{.underline} without creating fragmented or nationalized
markets.

5G is a different kind of network architecture. Great reliance on the
cloud and pushing processing to the edge offers opportunity for greater
security, as does an increasing reliance on a supply chain based on
American software and semiconductor technology. [Cybersecurity will
remain a **challenge** for the foreseeable future. Our goal with 5G
should be that the move to new technology does not increase that
challenge and, preferably, would]{.underline} actually **[shrink
it]{.underline}**. The emphasis on supply chain security in the last few
years has closed off one avenue to potential risk. [**Further progress**
will **require** addressing cybersecurity fundamentals and closer
partnerships with like-minded nations]{.underline}.

[A few years ago, no Western company was ready to challenge Huawei and
ZTE]{.underline}, but [this has **changed**. Western companies routinely
outspend]{.underline} their [Chinese competitors in **5G R&D** and hold
**10 times** as many 5G patents]{.underline}. Chinese companies still
depend on the Western companies for the most advanced 5G component
technologies, such as radio frequency processing or FGPAs (a specialized
semiconductor essential for software defined networks).6 [The issue
is]{.underline} not who leads, but [how to **maintain** that
lead]{.underline}.

[The United States **cannot** meet the 5G challenge **on its own**. When
the United States has overcome]{.underline} against [Chinese industrial
policy **in the past**, it has been done in **concert** with **U.S.
allies**. The United States will need a **unified approach** among
**like-minded companies** and **states** who are willing to **invest**
in **5G**]{.underline}. Part of creating this approach may be to define
voluntary agreements on security standards for secure 5G networks.

The Military's Big Plans for 5G

[The Department of Defense sees 5G]{.underline} technology [as a true
game changer for military forces]{.underline}, [able to]{.underline} one
day turn the tide of battle and [give our side an insurmountable
edge]{.underline}. It's not unlike the way that the military heavily
invested in radar technology during World War II. The DOD sees 5G as
being able to make that kind of difference one day. To that end, [they
are aggressively pursuing their 5G Strategy Implementation
Plan]{.underline}. The plan [includes]{.underline} promoting 5G
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [**development,** **testing**]{.underline}
both the advantages and potential vulnerabilities of 5G[, **engaging
with private-sector** partners and actively influencing industry as
policies and standards are developed and put in place]{.underline}. They
are already [pushing forward with those plans]{.underline}. Marine Corps
Logistics Base Albany, Georgia; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington;
Naval Base San Diego, California; Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; and
Hill Air Force Base, Utah, all now have 5G technology testbeds as part
of the "Tranche 1" phase of their plan. They are actively testing
everything from telemedicine to Battlefield of Things initiatives. And
the DOD is gearing up to begin the Tranche 2 phase, which will bring
more testbeds online at more bases.

**[DOD Is Already Testing Prototypes]{.underline}**

[We are still at the very early stages of 5G]{.underline}, but some of
the technology's potential uses are already gearing up for testing. For
example, the Defense Innovation Unit is working with private companies
to develop what it calls the Private 5G Program. The idea is that they
can design a small unit that can be dropped in almost anywhere and then
be activated to provide full 5G networking within a certain geographic
area. The Private 5G Program can work regardless of the existing
physical infrastructure in the area, so if there are no cell towers, it
won't matter. In fact, it's being designed to work specifically in areas
of low bandwidth, no bandwidth and even areas with potentially contested
bandwidth. It could be just as useful to a squad of soldiers operating
behind enemy lines on foreign soil as it is to National Guard troops
performing search and rescue operations or firefighting in remote areas
back home. And the DOD is learning about the pros and cons of 5G through
these testbed programs as well. For example, one might think that
providing 100 times the bandwidth might make 5G technology less secure
because it increases the footprint for attackers. But the opposite is
actually true. In fact, 5G has a lot of inherent advantages in terms of
security compared with 4G or 802.11 wireless technology. For example,
most of the data traffic on a 5G network can be routed thorough the IP
tunnel, which is encrypted by default. The DOD can then layer even more
security on top of that without worrying about clogging up the bandwidth
of a 5G network.

The Biggest Innovations Are Coming Soon

As impressive as the [prototypes coming out]{.underline} of the DOD 5G
testbeds are today, [many of them]{.underline}, like DIU's Private 5G
Program, [involve the infrastructure itself]{.underline}. The real
[**innovation will come after the infrastructure** is
established]{.underline}. Then [we will]{.underline} start to [see
things like **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}, [**robotics**,
predictive analytics,]{.underline} **[environmental
sensing]{.underline}** and things we can't even really imagine yet
starting to follow. There are programs that the military wants to do now
that simply aren't possible using a 4G network or 802.11 wireless
technology. The testbeds are not only showing how 5G will work, but what
is possible once the technology is in place. Who knows what innovations
are on the horizon. Will we see **[autonomous military
vehicles]{.underline}**, augmented reality-based navigation, real-time
[3D imaging of an entire battlefield]{.underline}, or any number of
seemingly impossible ideas suddenly becoming feasible? One thing that is
almost a certainty is that it will be the military driving the trends
this time. Like GPS when it first came out, these new [5G innovations
will]{.underline} likely [start as military-only tools before slowly
making their way to the mainstream]{.underline}. And at [the pace that
DOD]{.underline} [is setting, we can expect to see a lot of really
interesting ideas becoming reality very quickly as 5G continues to
evolve.]{.underline}

### Unilateral CP\-\--AT: DSS\-\--2AC

#### Can't solve [cybersecurity]{.underline} -- reallocation [opens up]{.underline} weaknesses for cyber attacks

**Alhakami '14** \[Wajdi Alhakami, 2014, "Spectrum Sharing Security and
Attacks in CRNs: a Review,"
<https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=5&Issue=1&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=11>,
St. Mark's, AM\]

However, [from a **security** viewpoint]{.underline}, **[no spectrum
sharing classifications]{.underline}**, which are discussed in section
2, [are **secure** against **any** malicious behaviour]{.underline}
while they are not supported with security mechanisms for protection and
detection (see table 1). Generally [the attackers' intention is to
determin]{.underline}ate [an effective strategy that exposes
a]{.underline} predictable [risk]{.underline}. For instance,
[when]{.underline} CCC is used in the cooperative method of
decentralised CRNs for [exchanging info]{.underline}rmation
[about]{.underline} the **[available channels]{.underline}** [and the
selected channel for **data transmission**]{.underline} [between
SUs]{.underline}, [it is **more prone to various attacks**]{.underline}
based on selfish and malicious behaviours \[41-42\]. [Because it is
regarded as a valuable structure for the attacker to access]{.underline}
the channel and gain the most [**sensitive info**rmation]{.underline},
[a key approach]{.underline} for some types of attackers [involves
applying a **PUE attack**]{.underline}. Moreover, [it is more exposed to
other attack types such as **eavesdropping** and **DoS**]{.underline},
[which can be launched easily due to **existing
weaknesses**]{.underline} within the MAC layer, [where **poor
authentication** and an existing **lack of encryption** mechanisms
enable an attacker to detect available channels that they can
occupy]{.underline} to forge or drop MAC frames, as shown in Figure 7
\[41, 56, 90\].

### Unilateral CP\-\--AT: DSS\-\--1AR

#### DSS [can't solve]{.underline} -- takes years, no tech, and can't [facilitate]{.underline} between systems

Together, [the FCC plan and the DoD responses demonstrate that
**d**ynamic **s**pectrum **s**haring (]{.underline}as envisioned by DoD)
**[is not a realistic option]{.underline}** [for widespread 5G
commercial networks]{.underline}. [The FCC states]{.underline} in its
order, "[Permitting licensed-by-rule operations would require
implementing coordination mechanisms similar to the Spectrum Access
Systems found in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service, thereby **adding
complexity** to this band **not otherwise required**]{.underline}."

Even [for the near future, the DoD]{.underline} RFI [responses yielded
**no magic spectrum sharing solutions**]{.underline}. [The RFI suggested
that DoD is seeking solutions **beyond** the types of approaches
**available** today]{.underline}, such as CBRS. [**No response**
detailed a technology that would facilitate spectrum sharing between
**different types** of systems, such as 5G and military
systems]{.underline}. For example, [one suggestion was for an **enhanced
CBRS architecture** with a DoD-controlled SAS that operates in
near-real-time, but such an approach would take **years** to
develop.]{.underline}

#### US initiatives [solve]{.underline} spectrum problems -- Europe is looking to use [our]{.underline} model

**Walko '21** \[John, 9-30-2021, \"Europe Struggling to Share
Spectrum,\" EE Times Europe,
<https://www.eetimes.eu/europe-struggling-to-share-spectrum/>, St.

The **[majority]{.underline}** may [favor]{.underline} the [Licensed
Shared Access]{.underline} ([LSA]{.underline}) route, [a technique
largely developed in Europe]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [there is
certainly no unanimity,]{.underline} with some countries preferring a
method by which operators would be allowed to share spectrum voluntarily
for the fastest services.

"[Even though]{.underline} the underlying [technologies]{.underline} for
many of the potential approaches [are **well-understood**]{.underline},
[catering to]{.underline} the [many]{.underline} local [specifics is
proving]{.underline} to be a **[difficult]{.underline}** task," said
Sumanasena. "This is [despite]{.underline} the fact that [in
Europe]{.underline}, as everywhere else, [**demand** for higher
speeds]{.underline} and more innovative services [is **increasing
exponentially**]{.underline}."

Sumanasena added that [the U.S. is **showing the way** on what can be
achieved]{.underline}, [with its focus on developing and then
implementing its]{.underline} Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(**[CBRS]{.underline}**) [after]{.underline} a far-sighted Federal
Communications Commission ([**FCC**) gave the all-clear]{.underline}.
(It should be noted that CBRS has nothing to do with the CB radio
network). "[It was a complex business]{.underline} getting from concept
to commercialization, taking some seven years, [with **multi-layer
approaches** and on whole new technologies]{.underline}," he said. "But
[the U.S. is now]{.underline} certainly **[reaping the
rewards]{.underline}**."

### Unilateral CP\-\--Links\-\--Politics\-\--2AC

#### Spectrum sharing gets perceived as [nationalizing 5G]{.underline} -- it's controversial with [industry]{.underline}, [lawmakers]{.underline}, and [officials]{.underline}

national 5G plan from DoD causes confusion, concern among lawmakers,\"

St. Mark's, AM\]

WASHINGTON --- Pentagon IT leaders have spent the week insisting the
[Defense Department]{.underline} does not want to build its own 5G
network after a [controversial request for information **troubled
lawmakers**]{.underline}, including, most recently, House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Adam Smith.

[The White House is]{.underline} reportedly [pressuring]{.underline} the
Pentagon [to lease]{.underline} some of its prized [spectrum for
the]{.underline} lucrative [5G market]{.underline} to a single
politically connected company, Rivada, using a non-competitive process.
The White House's push to fast track a contract for mid-band spectrum to
Rivada Networks has alarmed senior administration officials, according
to CNN.

Rivada and the Pentagon have both rejected those reports, but the
denials haven't squelched concerns on Capitol Hill that the
administration is using the Defense Department to make an end-run around
regulators in pursuit of an expensive boondoggle.

[The **concern** on Capitol Hill]{.underline} and elsewhere [stems from
a]{.underline} September [RFI from the **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense
that seeks]{.underline} industry [input on **dynamic spectrum
sharing**]{.underline}, or [ways the Defense Department and commercial
entities can safely operate on the **same spectrum** bands.]{.underline}

[The RFI]{.underline} asks "how could DoD own and operate 5G networks
for its domestic operations?" and "what are the potential issues with
DoD owning and operating independent networks for its 5G operations?,"
which [has **fueled fears and pushback in industry** about DoD
nationalizing a 5G network.]{.underline}

In a statement to C4ISRNET on Wednesday, [Pentagon]{.underline}
spokesperson Russ Goemaere [said]{.underline} "No, [DOD does not intend
to]{.underline} own and [operate a national 5G network]{.underline}."
Rather, he [said, the DoD needs to]{.underline} better
[understand]{.underline} how **[dynamic spectrum sharing]{.underline}**
can support training, readiness and lethality in the contiguous United
States.

\"This RFI will help DOD understand best methods and approaches for
owning and operating independent DoD 5G networks supporting 'spectrum
for training, readiness, and lethality,' \" Goemaere said.

Rivada has also denied allegations that it's in favor of a nationalized
5G network.

"We want to add our voice to those condemning, in the strongest terms,
anyone planning to nationalize 5G in America. Whoever they may be.
Assuming they exist," the company said in a statement Oct. 8.

The company also released part of its response to the RFI earlier in the
week that listed several reasons the DoD shouldn't operate a national 5G
network, including costs of operations and maintenance, as well as
limited coverage and capacity.

Frustration on the Hill

[The plan has been **met with opposition from** the wireless
**industry**, Republican and Democratic **lawmakers**, and]{.underline}
reportedly [**senior officials** within the]{.underline} Trump
[administration]{.underline}. On Wednesday, Smith told reporters he too
is opposed to what he has heard so far.

#### Spectrum sharing links to politics -- empirics prove.

In theory, government control of the 5G network could increase security
and ensure that 5G reaches rural markets where there is currently little
profit incentive for private industry to build infrastructure and
provide services. Congressional responses to proposals to nationalize
parts of the 5G network offer a window into the political aspect of the
5G issue.

The nationalization idea has been advanced twice, each time for a
different reason. First, in [early 2018, a [leaked National Security
Council
memo](https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html) proposed
that the U.S. government pay to build a single 5G
network]{.underline}---an unprecedented nationalization of private
infrastructure---in [order to compete with China and protect the system
from malicious cyber actors]{.underline}. Second, in March [2019,
Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276) that
Trump 2020 campaign officials supported a proposal]{.underline}---which
reportedly "spark\[ed\] wireless industry fears of
nationalization"---[under which the **government would** take over
spectrum designated for 5G and **develop a system to share the spectrum
with wireless providers** on a wholesale basis.]{.underline} According
to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276),
this was a bid by Trump campaign officials to woo rural voters who have
lacked adequate internet service in the absence of financial incentives
for wireless companies to offer affordable broadband. The plan
was [reportedly](https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/confusion-reigns-trump-2020-s-5g-wholesale-vision) backed
by Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale and Adviser [Newt
Gingrinch](https://www.facebook.com/newtgingrich/videos/newt-live-the-american-5g-failure/2262549377351710/).

**[Congressional pushback was clear and bipartisan]{.underline}**.
[Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., twice
introduced the thoroughly named [Eliminate From Regulators Opportunities
to Nationalize The Internet in Every Respect (EFRONTIER)

It would [prohibit the president and federal agencies from constructing,
operating, or offering wholesale or retail service on a broadband
network "unless a duly enacted Act of Congress signed into law by the
President provides the President or the agency ... with that
authority."]{.underline} An [[identical bipartisan

introduced on the House side.
And [another](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/893/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=3&s=2) [pair](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2881/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=1) of
bipartisan, bicameral bills calling for the Trump administration to
produce a strategy report contains an explicit limitation that the
report "shall not include a recommendation or a proposal to Federalize
5th or future generations mobile telecommunications systems or

broader in scope but [includes a **statement that** it is the policy of
the United States that "the **Federal Government should ... support but

The Key Elements of a 5G Strategy

The U.S. experience with 4G and the debate over how the country should
subsequently pursue [5G raise questions of the role and degree of
government involvement, type of government policies, and treatment of
foreign vendors in developing the telecommunication
infrastructure]{.underline}. Although it was not apparent in the U.S. 4G
rollout, [the United States must now also consider the **role of
allies** in developing and implementing a **5G strategy**]{.underline}
and focus more on securing its supply chain.

[5G technology, infrastructure, and supporting elements, such as
spectrum availability, span across various U.S. government agencies and
departments. Any successful strategy to secure 5G will need to account
for these different institutions]{.underline}**.** In Table 6.1, we
briefly discuss U.S. government departments and agencies with a role in
U.S. 5G.

In developing and implementing a strategy to secure the U.S. 5G
infrastructure, the government---which includes all the stakeholders
listed in Table 6.1---must account for the following key elements: •
[the role of government funding and investment for R&D • development of
secure 3GPP technical standards • federal policies that underpin the 5G
infrastructure (spectrum, base stations, etc.) • treatment of foreign 5G
infrastructure vendors • supply chain security • role of and
coordination with allies.]{.underline}

The role of government funding and investment for R&D refers to how the
government [can assist U.S. private-sector organizations and U.S. SSOs
to support 5G technical **standards** and technologies and how it can
assist U.S. academic institutions]{.underline} and companies in
developing advanced wireless communication and networking technologies.

Government R&D will also include resources provided to government R&D
organizations, such as NIST and ITS to evaluate important properties of
5G technical standards and NSF for basic research in advanced wireless
technologies. As discussed, the government played a minimal role in the
R&D for 3G and 4G. As a result, NIST, ITS, and NSF research portfolios
in wireless communications have historically been small. [Given the
**security considerations** that 5G has **amplified** in
telecommunications, the government has demonstrated an increased
emphasis on the development and deployment of 5G.]{.underline}

Thus, the second element[, federal **policies**, will also contribute to
how the United States **develops 5G** and at what pac]{.underline}e.
Many government bodies, such as the FCC, control electromagnetic
spectrum in the United States. [The policies these bodies implement will
dictate when and how 5G can be deployed]{.underline} (spectrum must be
made available in the C-band to realize the full benefits of 5G).
Spectrum allocation and bandwidth dictate how far apart base stations
will need to be spaced, which [will influence the cost to wireless
carriers for deploying 5G infrastructure.]{.underline}

Third, [the U.S. approach to 5G must consider how it treats foreign 5G
infrastructure vendor]{.underline}s. For example, the United States will
need to determine [which companies to exclude or include and how it
treats foreign vendors that have been included in an allied country's 5G
infrastructure]{.underline}. The reputation of foreign vendors and their
willingness to provide security-related information on their products
will be important considerations. Their willingness to share with U.S.
government officials the sources of the chipsets used in their
products---both who designed them and where they were
manufactured---will be increasingly important. [Foreign 5G
infrastructure vendors should be encouraged, but not required, to use
U.S.-designed chips. Just as in automobiles, it might be appropriate to
not necessarily impose U.S. content rules on 5G infrastructure
components manufactured overseas but to set goals that vendors could
strive to achieve. This would also enable U.S. officials to track the
use of foreign chipsets in U.S. 5G networks.]{.underline}

Fourth, the U.S. approach should also incorporate measures to secure its
5G supply chain. The United States must monitor the security of its 5G
supply chain and ensure that major vendors in the supply chain remain
trusted. Doing so involves ensuring that vendors do not become victims
of cyber or physical attacks that could interrupt the flow of
trustworthy 5G systems or components to end users, U.S. wireless
carriers, and those in allied countries. As discussed in Chapter Four,
U.S. companies in the 5G supply chain depend on third-party vendors in
Asia for state-of-the-art microchips necessary for 5G systems. The U.S.
government has recognized this dependence and has initiated legislation
to support the construction of leading edge microchip foundries in the
United States to ensure trustworthiness.

Last, [the United States must consider the role of allies and how they
decide to secure their own 5G networks. Allied countries, specifically
those where U.S. military installations reside, could affect U.S.
communications and either invite or mitigate
vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

A U.S. strategy for [5G security must incorporate these
elements]{.underline}. As discussed throughout this report, many of
these elements have emerged in the transition from 4G to
5G---specifically, concerns about the supply chain and rise of Chinese
vendors. The next section outlines several options and explores the
merits and downsides of each approach.

## Stop 5G CP

### Stop 5G\-\--2AC

#### No one says yes to bans\-\--even hacks think banning 5G is overkill. 

**Cassauwers '19** (Tom Cassauwers, Belgian freelance journalist for
media such as BBC, Knack, DataNews, EOS and De Ingenieur. "Is 5G bad for
your health? It's complicated, say researchers\" 10/07/19
<https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/horizon-magazine/5g-bad-your-health-its-complicated-say-researchers>)
☺

In September 2017, doctors [and scientists launched the 5G Appeal, a
petition which calls for the EU to impose a moratorium on 5G
rollout]{.underline}, citing [imminent health dangers like increased
cancer risks, cellular stress and genetic damage]{.underline}. The
petition now has [more than 250 signatories]{.underline}. In March this
year, then [Brussels minister of environment Céline Fremault blocked a
5G rollout saying she wouldn't turn the city's inhabitants into
'laboratory mice'.]{.underline} In Bern, Switzerland, a protest in May
led some administrative areas to block the construction of 5G antennas.

So how different is 5G and could it impact our health? The reality,
experts say, is complex.

'We have been involved in hundreds of studies about electromagnetic
radiation and human health,' said Professor Niels Kuster, founder and
director of the Swiss IT'IS Foundation. He was project coordinator for
ARIMMORA, a study into the relation between the electromagnetic
radiation emitted by power lines and childhood leukaemia.

Both mobile phones and telecom antennas emit electromagnetic radiation,
regardless of what network generation they are used for. They send out
non-ionising radiation, which is located at the lower end of the
frequency spectrum. Most electrical gear emits this type of radiation,
from microwave ovens to power lines.

Non-ionising radiation has completely different health effects from
ionising radiation, which is higher up the spectrum and includes X-Rays
or nuclear radiation, which have proven harmful effects for human
health.

Radiation

Non-ionising radiation can affect us in two ways, according to Prof.
Kuster. Just like a microwave oven heats food using non-ionising
radiation, telecom gear can do the same to the human body if it emits
too much.

'That\'s well understood scientifically and there are clear safety
guidelines for this,' he said. The International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a global scientific body,
for example, has determined a norm for this and continually monitors
thermal effects.

We have less of an understanding of the second way in which non-ionising
radiation can affect us - how it interferes with us biologically, says
Prof. Kuster.

There have been claims that telecom equipment causes cancer and
electrohypersensitivity where people experience headaches, nausea or
even rashes they believe to be the result of exposure to electromagnetic
radiation.

Prof. Kuster says that there is very little clear scientific evidence
showing that radiation causes the exhibited symptoms associated with
electrohypersensitivity. The World Health Organization noted that
double-blind studies have been unable to establish a correlation.

The evidence around cancer is, however, more difficult to interpret.
Several large-scale epidemiological studies showed mixed results. The
most well-known is probably the 13-country Interphone study from 2000 to
2006 with around 5,000 patients. This tried to find a correlation
between mobile phone use and cancer.

It concluded that 'no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was
observed with use of mobile phones'. For people who used mobile phones
more intensively at that time, however, there were 'suggestions' of
higher glioma rates, but errors and biases could not be ruled out, so no
causal relationship could be established.

Some animal or lab-based cell studies have shown certain negative health
effects from radiation. This eventually led the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) to classify electromagnetic radiation as
'possibly carcinogenic to humans.'

This may sound scary but refers largely to uncertainty in the results.
Aloe vera leaves, for example, are in the same category. Working at a
barber shop is in a higher category, classified as 'probably
carcinogenic to humans' because of the chemicals hairdressers interact
with.

Tracking

Other studies are happening right now, such as COSMOS, which is being
carried out in the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, the UK, Denmark and
France.

'In total we're tracking 290,000 people across Europe, who we consult
every five years,' said Professor Hans Kromhout, an epidemiologist at
Utrecht University in the Netherlands who works on the Dutch chapter of
COSMOS.

They use information from mobile phone operators to track consenting
participants' actual phone use, and then relate that to health outcomes.
This was necessary as from previous studies, it became clear that
participants have difficulties accurately reporting their own phone
usage.

'The data for cancer we don't have yet,' said Prof. Kromhout. 'But we
recently released a study for Sweden and Finland, which found an
association between frequent phone use and headaches.' But it unlikely
due to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, he adds.

[\'It would be good if public institutions invested more in research
into these fields.\']{.underline}

Prof. Hans Kromhout, Utrecht University, the Netherlands

This study looked at 21,049 Swedes and 3,120 Finns, and tried
correlating phone use with headaches, sinusitis and hearing problems.
Participants who called more than 276 minutes per week reported a
slightly higher degree of weekly headaches. But it turned out that
participants who had 2G-phones (which emit more radiation) did not have
a higher degree of headaches than those with 3G-phones (which emit less
radiation).

And if a clear association between this kind of radiation and cancer was
found, an underlying cause would still be missing since we don't
understand the potential biological effects, according to Prof.
Kromhout.

'We still don't have a mechanism to explain why the human body would
have this reaction,' said Prof. Kromhout. 'And without a biological
mechanism you cannot have a clear, causal relation, because it could
just as well be that something else is causing the cancer.'

Millimetre waves

Ever since we've had mobile phones, there have been concerns about their
negative health effects. In most areas, the 5G debate is a continuation
of all of this, which is logical. The radiation 5G emits will largely be
the same as it was for 4G, 3G and 2G before, except for one area:
millimetre waves.

These waves are higher up the spectrum than the frequencies we have so
far used for mobile telecommunications, although they are still
non-ionising radiation.

Millimetre waves are a sub-technology of 5G, which can transfer more
information, although for shorter distances. For now, these frequencies
aren't being implemented or even auctioned in Europe, although in the US
operators have been using them to build their 5G networks. There has
been little research about their health effects.

We know, for example, that they don't penetrate our skin as much as
lower frequency waves, yet that could also mean a different risk
assessment, with more attention placed on the skin.

'I don\'t claim we need to be concerned about millimetre wave exposure,'
said Prof. Kuster. 'But it\'s irresponsible to not have much data and
expose large groups of people to these fields. So, there should be more
investment into tests about this.'

An argument often used against this sort of research though, is that
it's influenced by the private sector. Telecom companies, according to
activists, often fund this research to influence it in their direction.
Prof. Kuster accepts private sector funds, and in Sweden, COSMOS is
partly funded by a number of mobile phone operators, with a scientific
institute acting as a 'firewall' between the researchers and the
companies.

He says that the results of a study don't depend on where the money came
from but on the quality of the research.

'It would be good if public institutions invested more in research into
these fields,' said Prof. Kromhout, whose COSMOS study is funded by the
Dutch government. 'That way we can also put to rest doubts about the
objectivity of researchers.'

Until now the EU has funded some research on electromagnetic radiation,
but currently there is no EU project focusing on the health effects of
5G.

[So if **we aren't certain about 5G's health effects**, shouldn't
we]{.underline} just ban it [until we are and apply the precautionary
principle? **Not according to**]{.underline} both
**[experts]{.underline}**.

'[That would be too much]{.underline},' said Prof. Kromhout. '[We
should]{.underline} keep studying and observing this question and [be
vigilant. But a **complete ban would be too much** and **stop
technological innovation**. We also haven't seen a large rise of brain
cancer in the last 20 years, even though cell phone use has
exploded.']{.underline}

https://idstch.com/military/us-launches-5g-military-strategy-and-declares-5g-competition-as-a-new-arms-race/

Military requirements enabled by 5G

[5G is important to DoD because it offers **higher performance and
additional capabilities**]{.underline}**,** particularly for data driven
applications and [for machine-to-machine communication]{.underline}.
These capabilities will [become the foundation for a new networked way
of war]{.underline} that brings together sensors and machines that will
revolutionize the battlespace and the logistics and support functions
behind the front lines**. [DoD must have access to a 5G defense
industrial base]{.underline}** [that **provides trustworthy 5G
technologies**]{.underline}**.**

[The military requires High-mobility connectivity]{.underline}.
[Communications devices must operate while vehicles or soldiers are
mobile, even at speeds in excess of 100 mph.]{.underline} Samsung
researchers confirmed the world\'s first data rate of 1.2 Gbps, or 150
MB per second on a vehicle cruising at over 100 km/h. [5G soldiers could
**receive real-time streaming video** from aircraft, such as the
Predator Drone **flying over a battlefield**]{.underline}**.**

[**Military\'s growing requirements** to gather, analyze, and share
information rapidly;]{.underline} to control an increasing number of
automated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance ([ISR)
assets]{.underline}; to command geog[raphically dispersed and mobile
forces]{.underline} to gain access into denied areas; and to \"train as
we fight\" requires that DoD maintain sufficient spectrum access,\" says
DOD\'s Electromagnetic Spectrum Strategy unveiled in February 2014.

[The military requirements for higher data rates for **network-centric
capabilities** and the **increasing demand for data transmission** to
support **situational awareness** is driving the move to higher RF
frequencies (]{.underline}60 GHz, 94 GHz). The push to higher radio
frequencies makes available greater bandwidths and reductions in size -
both [attractive propositions for the military in much the same way as
it is attractive to civilian users.]{.underline} DARPA, is working on a
project called Mobile Hotspots, which would provide millimetre wave
communications to troops in remote areas via drones, giving them access
to wireless speeds of around 1 Gb per second.

Many 5G systems are based on the wide spectrum available at mmWave
frequencies, essentially 30 GHz and above. [The giant investments into
mmWave will produce a thriving commercial industry generating passive
components]{.underline}, radios, power amps, antennas, and the like.
This will result in drop in prices of these components, [much to the
benefit of existing military applications including satellite
communication.]{.underline}

Similarly the [considerable investment into 5G low-cost phased array
antennas]{.underline}, beamforming algorithms, and phase and amplitude
adjustable [components will lead to cost and productivity advancements
for its higher end military phased-array radars. 5G mobile applications
will add real-time tracking as well.]{.underline}

[Military is interested in deploying 5G wireless mesh networks for its
communication needs,]{.underline} which are more robust and
[self-healing,]{.underline} the communications packets find the [best
route to the destination]{.underline} based on traffic levels and
available system bandwidth. [5G, shall enable mesh networking to enable
devices to communicate with each other directly]{.underline} rather than
via base stations, which should increase the bandwidth, lower power
consumption, reduce infrastructure costs, and [improve spectral
efficiency.]{.underline}

[Military engagements are often spontaneous, and]{.underline} a
communications solution needs to be, as well. The communication system
should be deployable with little or no fixed architecture. 5G shall
enable future

Military Adhoc sensor n[etworks that are expected to be widely deployed
for battlefield surveillance, detecting and characterizing Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) attacks and
materials.]{.underline}

Each node may be equipped with a [variety of sensors, such as acoustic,
seismic, infrared, still/motion video camera,]{.underline} etc. These
WSNs may connect to the rest of the world through the 5G cellular
network. The Mobile phones may themselves be integrated with more and
more actual sensor capabilities and form a wireless sensor network.

#### Euro-Sino relations are [in the dumps]{.underline}.

RMax, edited for errors

In April and May, as Russia's war in Ukraine entered its third month,
China sent a special envoy to meet with officials in eight central and
eastern European countries. The timing was not coincidental: [in the
**two months** since Russia had launched its invasion, China's standing
in Europe had sunk to **new lows**. **European governments** were
**dismayed** by Beijing's **strengthened ties to Moscow** and
its]{.underline} tacit [**support** for **Russia's
aggression**]{.underline}, and the Chinese leadership hoped to do damage
control in a part of the continent where it believed it had special
sway.

For a decade now, China has made the countries of central and eastern
Europe one of its diplomatic focal points. Offering top-level access in
Beijing and dangling huge trade opportunities, Chinese officials
believed they could use this belt of smaller, post-communist governments
as a counterweight to critical voices in the European Union and U.S.
influence on the European continent. And with the war in Ukraine
bringing a chill over China's European relations, [Beijing
**assumed**]{.underline} that [a series of **brisk meetings** in the
region]{.underline}---including in Budapest, Prague, Riga, and
Warsaw---[would help turn the tables]{.underline} it **[\[in\] its
favor]{.underline}**. But [these efforts went **nowhere**. **Instead**,
the Chinese ambassador and the rest of her delegation were **rebuffed**,
with the Czech foreign ministry]{.underline}, for example, [saying it
used the meeting to express "**reservations** to current Chinese
cooperation with Russia."]{.underline}

[Of the many]{.underline} important [**ripple effects** of the war in
Ukraine, the **growing rupture** between **China** and **Europe** is
perhaps the least appreciated]{.underline}. In earlier years, the
Chinese government viewed the European Union as an area of the world
where it could pursue its economic interests with fewer of the
geopolitical tensions that characterize its relations with Washington.
And it set out to use what it saw as its special ties with a large group
of countries in central and eastern Europe, in particular, to cement
this business-over-politics approach. For European governments that,
like China, had transitioned to capitalism in recent decades, China was
a powerful new partner that held out the potential of large-scale
investment in their economies. In return, Beijing hoped to find a
backdoor to Europe's vast markets, as well as gain new political
leverage in its growing rivalry with the United States.

**[Today]{.underline}**, however, [Europe has become one of China's
**biggest foreign-policy headaches**]{.underline}. In part, [the current
situation is a result of economic miscalculations by both
sides]{.underline}, which overestimated the potential benefits of the
arrangement. But [China's increasingly rigid position on Taiwan has made
things **worse**. The Chinese government has **retaliated** against
**Lithuania** for giving a **small amount** of symbolic recognition to
**Taiwan**; and over the past year, it has made **threatening noises**
toward **other European governments** over the **same issue**. Amid
these **souring relations**, China's support for Russia in Ukraine has
brought its European troubles to a head]{.underline}.

The stakes are not small. The war in Ukraine has exposed how few allies
China has and how badly the Chinese leadership miscalculated in pursuing
close ties with Russia. [Beijing's heavy-handed efforts to gain
**leverage** in **Europe** have also **backfired**]{.underline}. Even as
its economy and growing military strength guarantee it power and
attention, [its **failed European project** has underscored its
**inability** to win durable partners among the advanced
**democracies**---a pattern that seems likely to hinder its long-term
influence in the world]{.underline}.

Paul Haenle: [How do you think]{.underline} the

Philippe Le Corre: I think [it's **impacting** the relationship
**tremendously**]{.underline}. All my contact with Chinese colleagues
over the past few weeks . . . it's been a dialogue of the deaf, in the
sense that [people don't]{.underline} seem to [realize in China how
**dreadful** this war has been]{.underline}. . . .

There are many issues that the EU is willing to discuss with China. I
don't think the door is closed. There will be more meetings. Their
relationship is not as bad as the U.S.-China relationship.

On the economic front, there are many things going on, but [there's also
the **COVID**]{.underline} \[pandemic\] **[issue]{.underline}**. A
number of [European countries are **not very satisfied** with the way
China has handled the **pandemic**]{.underline} for the past year, with

Also, [on the [Comprehensive Agreement on

\[[a proposed **China-EU** investment deal]{.underline}\], there was
some progress being made through this agreement, [which was discussed
for **seven years**]{.underline}---a very long time for an agreement,
even by EU standards. The problem is that the EU has to stand for its
values and principles. It has a principled diplomacy, as \[High

for the next two years]{.underline}.

We should be continuing to talk about climate, biodiversity, and how to
prevent the next pandemic, but on the economic front, [it's **not** so
**clear** how we're going to get out of this]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [the **relationship** is **not as smooth** as it was before,

[Although the Commission remains measured in its approach, human rights
and Taiwan have come to occupy an increasingly outspoken role in the
EU's agenda, and the European Parliament is driving it.]{.underline}
Following the publication of the "Xinjiang Police Files", political
groups in the European Parliament have pushed a resolution on Xinjiang
(more on this in the Buzzword).

[During the annual EU-Taiwan trade and investment dialogue, the two have
looked to **upgrade their economic relationship**. China has **warned
the EU** of the risks but has not "punished" the block]{.underline}, not
only because the Commission made sure not to cross the political red
line, but also because unlike punishing single member states, punishing
the whole of the EU may result in shooting oneself in the foot (more on
this in the Review section).

[The most important change is perhaps occurring in member states who
**no longer ignore or sideline difficult matters**]{.underline} in their
dealings with China. Even [**Germany seems to have taken tangible
steps** towards curbing its business links with the region. The
government has refused to extend investment guarantees for certain

BROKEN PROMISES?

According to Chinese figures, [trade between China and its European
partners]{.underline} grew eight percent a year between 2012 and 2020
and surged even more during the pandemic. But the growth was starting
from a very low base, and the [results have been **extremely
modest**]{.underline}. According to the Czech researcher Richard Q.
Turcsanyi, [China **still accounts** for **less than two percent** of
the central and eastern European region's exports and **nine percent**
of its imports; Chinese foreign direct investment has had an **even
smaller impact**]{.underline}, making up less than one percent of total
foreign direct investment. [That]{.underline}, Turcsanyi has observed,
[means]{.underline} that [central and eastern Europe "has the **least
Chinese presence** when compared to **any other region in the world**
when measured by its shares of economic interaction]{.underline}." Given
Beijing's decade-long effort to cultivate the region, [this is an
**astonishingly poor showing**]{.underline}.

[One reason]{.underline} the results were so dismal [is
that]{.underline} the [**Chinese approach** left it up to Chinese
companies to do the actual investing]{.underline}. Although many Chinese
companies are state owned, they are still profit oriented. And [for
these enterprises, central and eastern Europe simply **isn't very
attractive**]{.underline}. Compared to western Europe, it is less
densely populated, cities are dispersed across a large area, there is
less infrastructure, and standards of living are lower. **[No
wonder]{.underline}**, despite Beijing's rhetorical encouragement, [few
Chinese companies have taken up the call to invest in the
region]{.underline}.

Seen broadly, [China's **mishaps** in Europe reflect an approach to
policymaking that make sense in the Chinese context but **does not
always play well overseas**, especially in]{.underline} advanced
[**democracies**, where governments are **more directly accountable** to
their electorates. Many initiatives in China are often showy affairs
that start with a bang and report creatively produced
statistics]{.underline}. They offer a statement of intent rather than
concrete plans. Content is added later, sometimes years later, or never
at all.

[Another problem was China's mercantilist approach to foreign policy and
trade---basing **foreign relations** on calculations of **economic
gain**]{.underline}. All countries do this to some extent, but [China is
unusual among major powers in relying **so heavily** on **economic
ties** to shape its foreign relations]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
projects that China has announced have often turned into boondoggles or
dead ends. Along with the high-speed rail project, these include a
\$15.6 billion expansion of the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant in
Romania, for which the promised Chinese investment never materialized.
In 2020, seven years after China had signed on to the deal, the project
was taken over by a U.S. consortium. Partly because of the nuclear plant
debacle, the Romanian government last year banned Chinese companies from
participating in public infrastructure tenders. Other [governments in
the region]{.underline} have made similar moves, [view]{.underline}ing
[Chinese bidding on contracts as harmful to their efforts to compete

ARM-TWISTING ON TAIWAN

But [China's **eroding support** in Europe has not been limited to
**economic failures**. **Many European governments** have increasingly
**bridled** at **Beijing's efforts** to use its economic might to
**silence criticism** of its own policies and human rights record.
Nowhere has this coercive strategy been more pronounced than on the
matter of **Taiwan**]{.underline}.

Consider the case of Lithuania. [In **deference** to **China**, **most
countries** in Europe and elsewhere have used the word "**Taipei**" to
describe]{.underline} any [Taiwanese representative]{.underline} offices
in their countries, [the idea being that it was acceptable to use the
island's capital rather than its proper name because the latter somehow
implied **statehood**. When Lithuania decided to flout this]{.underline}
convention last year---allowing Taiwan to open a representative office
that featured "Taiwan" in its name---[Beijing responded with a **total
economic ban** on the country]{.underline}. It not only cut off
Lithuanian exports to China but threatened to ban any product
manufactured in another country if the item contained a Lithuanian
component.

At first, it seemed that Lithuania would find few supporters in Europe
for refusing to bow to Chinese demands. That was especially true after
China threatened to sanction international companies that used
components made in Lithuania. Some EU countries--- including Germany,
which has a large trade with China---put informal pressure on Lithuania
to back down on its pro-Taiwanese stance. Gradually, however,
[**European leaders** found Beijing's hardline behavior
**intolerable**]{.underline}. In January 2022, [**Brussels** launched a
case with the **W**orld **T**rade **O**rganization, accusing Beijing of
engaging in **discriminatory practices** because it stopped clearing
Lithuanian goods through customs and rejected import applications from
Lithuania. It was amid these **deteriorating relations** that the war in
Ukraine turned **many European governments** more **decisively against
China**]{.underline}.

RUSSIA OVER EUROPE?

[The **Chinese government's** support for Russia in the lead-up to the
**invasion** caught many European leaders by **surprise**]{.underline}.
Just before the war began, [China and Russia issued a **joint
communiqué** that endorsed Russia's call for NATO to be rolled back to
**1997 borders**. This action would have stripped countries such as the
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and the Baltic
states]{.underline}---all of them members of the 16+1 group that China
was supposedly supporting---[of **NATO weapons** and
**troops**]{.underline}, leaving them as vulnerable as Ukraine.

[**Beijing's behavior** since the war began]{.underline}---repeating the
Russian talking point that the invasion was provoked by NATO
enlargement---[has **crystalized** the **growing unease** in European
capitals]{.underline}. In March, [German Foreign Minister]{.underline}
Annalena [Baerbock said]{.underline} that [the war showed that
"one-sided economic alignments in fact make us vulnerable. Not just with
regard to Russia." **European frustration** with **China** **boiled
over** after a summit in early April between senior Chinese leaders and
the European Parliament]{.underline}. The [EU's top
representative]{.underline} for foreign affairs, Joseph Borrell, [called
it a "dialogue of the deaf."]{.underline} These sentiments have been
especially strong among the members of the 16+1, many of which are now
on the frontlines of the face-off with Russia and have themselves
benefited from NATO security guarantees.

[Several European countries have now **openly embraced** Lithuania's
**outspoken position** on **Taiwan**]{.underline}. One is the Czech
Republic, which is also one of the wealthiest countries in the region.
In April, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky demanded greater scrutiny
of China's support for Russia, accused China of having "bullied" Taiwan,
and called for closer Czech-Taiwan relations. Latvia, Lithuania's close
neighbor, has meanwhile called on Beijing to "use more leverage in order
to stop Russia's aggression against Ukraine."

Notably, the 16+1 itself has seemed increasingly moribund. Last year,
six member countries decided against having their heads of state attend
a virtual summit with Xi Jinping, sending lower-level officials instead.
This year, the 16+1 summit did not take place, possibly because of the
war in Ukraine.

#### Ukraine thumps -- trade is down and the EU won't budge

Center from 2019-2021, former fellow with the Mossavar-Rahmani Center
for Business and Government (M-RCBG) from 2017-2019, sr. fellow in the

Two months later, on April 1, President [Xi held another summit --- this
time with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and
European Council President Charles Michel.]{.underline} For the first
time in several years, [the Chinese leadership faced a stern European
side**, unwilling to address topics other than the war in Ukraine.**
Under such circumstances, "**there cannot be business as usual**," von
der Leyen said. Although China's ability to influence Putin is limited,
the EU still argued that China has unique channels with
Russia.]{.underline}

The Chinese side, however, has a very different view. President Xi has
called on Europe to have an "autonomous" view of China (presumably
autonomous from the United States), and Beijing insists that the
solution to the conflict is to accommodate the "reasonable security
concerns of all parties concerned." Still, China has not, by and large,
tried to circumvent Western economic sanctions toward Russia ---
although it is quietly encouraging a coalition of nations who do not
want to take sides on Ukraine.

[Beijing certainly does not welcome instability and economic
turmoil]{.underline}, but China's image has already dropped
significantly in Europe. Since 2020, COVID-19 and the way some Chinese
diplomats engaged in propaganda over "mask diplomacy" (through social
media and embassy websites) have left scars. Furthermore, [Beijing's
willingness to embrace and magnify EU divisions in the early stages of
the pandemic has led to a backlash both in European **public opinion and
governmental elites**, who have become **irritated by China's aggressive
discourse**]{.underline}. This explains the relative hardening of
Brussels' position vis-à-vis Chinese investments, state subsidies, and
"coercive economic measures" on a member-state [like Lithuania, which
was sanctioned by China last year for opening a new Taiwan office. The
EU has reacted by launching a case before WTO, calling such actions
"discriminatory."]{.underline}

On a macro-economic level, [Chinese]{.underline} foreign direct
investments [(FDI) have dropped significantly]{.underline} according to
a recent MERICS/Rhodium Group report. Although Chinese FDI in Europe
increased 33% to \$11.1 billion (from \$8.3 billion in 2020), [2021 was
the second-lowest year (above only 2020) for China's investment in

partner for EU exports of goods (10.2%) in 2021 and the largest partner
for EU imports of goods (22.4%). [Following the sanctions on Lithuania,

### Eurasia DA\-\--AT: EU Leadership\-\--2AC

#### Alt causes to EU leadership. 

Tony **Barber 19**, Europe editor at the Financial Times, 11-4-2019,
\"New EU leadership team must up its game on foreign policy,\"
https://www.ft.com/content/e08b101e-fa48-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\
\
The [new EU leadership]{.underline} team taking office in Brussels
[knows that, if the bloc's common foreign policy is to command
respect]{.underline}, the first place where it must achieve success is
in Europe's neighbourhood. [It needs to be well-planned]{.underline}, as
[united]{.underline} as possible, [efficiently executed and]{.underline}
[imbued with a larger sense of long-term strategy]{.underline}. [In all
these regards]{.underline}, two [recent episodes]{.underline} --- one
concerning [the Balkans]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the other
[Syria]{.underline} --- **[have been little short of a
debacle]{.underline}**.

[Each incident points to the **EU's inability to translate its undoubted
weight**]{.underline} as a commercial and regulatory bloc
**[into]{.underline}** hard **[power on the world stage]{.underline}**.
[**It is not just a matter of lack of military muscle**, important
though that is. The real problem is]{.underline} that, [whenever two or
more of the EU's biggest countries are in disagreement]{.underline}, a
[common European foreign policy is]{.underline} either ~~paralysed~~
\[[stagnated]{.underline}\] [or becomes a question of finding the
**lowest common denominator**]{.underline} among 28 states. An often
overlooked point is that [these disagreements tend to arise out of
**domestic political tensions** in individual countries]{.underline} ---
over, for example, irregular migration or attitudes to Islam or Russia.
Such [tensions]{.underline} [hobble]{.underline} the [attempts of
governments to **find common ground** with their EU
partners]{.underline}.

In any case, [France, Germany and other EU countries usually prefer to
keep their freedom of manoeuvre when it suits them]{.underline}. The
Syrian episode centres on Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is Angela
Merkel's preferred candidate to succeed her as German chancellor. Ms
Kramp-Karrenbauer was named defence minister in July in an apparent
attempt to raise her profile with German voters. But the proposal for a
multinational security zone in northern Syria that she came up with this
month was startling for its naivety and lack of preparation. Before
unveiling her plan, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Ms Merkel as the
Christian Democratic party's leader in December ahead of elections due
in 2021, consulted neither her Social Democratic coalition partners nor
Germany's Nato and EU allies. Her proposal skipped over crucial
questions such as whether the UN Security Council would endorse it,
whether the US would take part and whether Germany's under-resourced
armed forces would send soldiers to Syria. To each question it rapidly
became clear that the answer was almost certain to be no. Indeed, it was
hard to tell who was more dismissive of the initiative --- Russia and
Turkey, which control events on the ground in Syria, or Heiko Maas,
Germany's foreign minister, who is of course a colleague of Ms
Kramp-Karrenbauer. In this way, the plan served no purpose other than to
illustrate the incoherence of the German coalition's foreign policy, not
to mention the EU's near-irrelevance in Syria.

This is a sobering thought in view of the fact that the 2015 arrival of
large numbers of war refugees from Syria and other conflict zones, plus
other migrants, precipitated one of the EU's worst crises since the 1957
Treaty of Rome that set up the bloc.

The [EU's mis-steps in the Balkans are no less painful to
watch]{.underline}, but in this case the main culprit is France, not
Germany. By blocking Albania and North Macedonia from opening EU
membership talks, President [Emmanuel Macron **shocked and undermined a
region whose stability is integral to**]{.underline} the [**stability**
of the European continent]{.underline}. In North Macedonia's case, Mr
Macron's move made the EU reek of hypocrisy. For the EU had long
promised to start entry talks, provided that the Macedonians compromise
with Greece over their country's disputed name --- a condition fulfilled
in the Prespa agreement, which came into force last February.

In fairness to Mr [Macron]{.underline}, he [is not alone in having
doubts about enlarging the EU into south-eastern Europe]{.underline}.
Denmark and the Netherlands joined France in opposing Albania's entry
talks. Moreover, when the European parliament adopted a resolution last
week in favour of starting accession talks with the two Balkan states,
some 136 MEPs --- or almost a quarter of those who voted --- backed Mr
Macron's position. Furthermore, Mr [Macron]{.underline} has a point when
he [suggests]{.underline} that [the EU should focus on **internal
reforms** before absorbing]{.underline} new members. The EU's most
important project, [the 19-nation eurozone, remains a half-built
house]{.underline}. **[Effective EU-wide action is woefully
lacking]{.underline}** in areas such as migration and asylum policy.
However, Mr Macron would sound more persuasive, but for the persistent
rumours that France's true objective is to close the EU door forever to
western Balkan countries. Instead they would be fobbed off with
membership of the European Economic Area, which would keep them out of
the EU's political institutions and make them permanent second-class
Europeans. The Syrian and Balkan embarrassments are symptoms of an EU
unsure of its place in the world and suffering from ineffective
Franco-German co-operation. But if **[the EU cannot get things right on
its own doorstep, where can it?]{.underline}**

### Eurasia DA\-\--AT: EU Leadership\-\--1AR

#### Collective action problem 

Wolfgang **MüNchau 19**, associate editor of the Financial Times,
10-27-2019, \"Europe needs to solve its collective action problem,\"
https://www.ft.com/content/0d5126aa-f72a-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65

The news is less dramatic than Turkey's invasion of northern Syria, or
our daily fix of Brexit news. But it is hard to overestimate the
importance of German chancellor Angela [Merkel's decision to allow
Huawei]{.underline}, the Chinese telecoms group, [to bid for Germany's
5G mobile]{.underline} [network]{.underline}.

This [is the quintessential instance of EU's **collective action
problem**]{.underline}: [a large European country makes a unilateral
decision to the detriment of other member states of the
bloc.]{.underline}

[Germany's constitutional balanced budget rule is another example. I
would classify it as the **single most stupid economic policy decision
taken by a G7 country**]{.underline} in my lifetime. It artificially
constrains the ability of fiscal policy to stabilise the economy at a
time when monetary policy has hit the limits. [The governance of the
eurozone is the grandfather of the EU's collective action problems.
Huawei is the grandchild.]{.underline}

The issues with Huawei's 5G bid will become clear much sooner: the
company exposes the EU to security risks. Unless the German parliament
manages to overturn Ms Merkel's decision, other countries are bound to
follow. This in turn will limit the EU's ability to develop an
industrial policy towards China. It would be a diplomatic own goal on a
scale similar to US President Donald Trump's decision to pull American
troops out of Syria.

There are technical and commercial reasons for Germany to favour the
Huawei bid. German telecom operators are already invested in Huawei's
technology. And the German economy would take a hit if China were to
respond to a Huawei ban in kind. But these economic effects are small
compared to the wider implications. Two of the world's three 5G
producers, Nokia and Ericsson, are European. Why not let European
companies build the EU's 5G network?

As a Chinese company, Huawei would struggle to dispel doubts about its
ability to shield sensitive EU data from the Chinese security services.

[The EU cannot base its industrial strategy on]{.underline} the
[illusory hope]{.underline} that a Chinese-owned company might stand up
to Chinese politicians or defy Chinese law. 5G is not simply another
telephone network. [It will be a critical component of the
telecommunications infrastructure on which much of our future commercial
activity will be based.]{.underline}

[**By** its **nature**, **the EU is not well equipped to deal with this
type of problem**]{.underline}. [It is good at triangulating between the
divergent interests of its members, **but not at developing a coherent
geopolitical strategy**]{.underline}. [For example, the EU has failed to
leverage the euro into a foreign policy tool]{.underline}. [**Foreign
policy was not on member states' minds**]{.underline} when they created
monetary union. And [despite some minor reforms here and there, the
eurozone's governance framework is still similar to what it was 20 years
ago]{.underline}.

[A **small-country mindset** doesn't simply disappear when states come
together to form a union. And today's policy debate in the eurozone is
still full of single-country obsessions like competitiveness and fiscal
rules]{.underline}. [A similar mindset afflicts foreign policy. In
**contrast to the Americans, Chinese or Russians**, Europeans are
framing foreign policy in terms of relationships, not
interests]{.underline}. Interest-based policies are discretionary by
definition. But [the EU is rules-based]{.underline}. As central bankers
are only too well aware, [rules and discretion do not happily
coexist]{.underline}.

[The EU has shown that it can act forcefully when there is
near-unanimity, as was the case]{.underline} when national leaders
responded to Russia's annexation [of Crimea. But **that was an
exception**]{.underline}. **[More typical has been]{.underline}** the
**[failure]{.underline}** to agree a joint immigration policy.
Immigration is a classic collective action problem where interests are
not aligned.

#### Poor leadership and beauracracy. 

Prince Michael **Liechtenstein 19**, founder and Chairman of
Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG Vaduz, 11-04-2019, \"Bureaucracy
and centralization are limiting freedom in Europe,\"
https://www.gisreportsonline.com/how-to-destroy-the-european-union,3019,c.html

Expanding bureaucracies

However, [Parkinson's law -- that work expands to fill the time
available for its completion -- took hold in European **bureaucracy**,
which **overran institutions**]{.underline}. [Its growth]{.underline}
did not stop at the national level, but **[infiltrated EU
administration]{.underline}**. More and
more [centralization](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/the-ever-ambiguous-european-union-project,politics,2906.html) and
harmonization were imposed through a web of new rules and regulations.
[Local, national and regional specificities and needs are frequently
ignored. This took place even as national bureaucracies grew
increasingly]{.underline} excessive. Now, two nannies domineer over
European citizens: their national governments and the European
Commission.

This situation might still be accepted if Brussels, with the support of
some governments, did not harmonize and unify various measures,
undermining the principles of self-determination, local control and
subsidiarity to the point where individual citizens feel it acutely.

[The problem of potentially excessive centralization is a consequence of
**weak leadership and expedient policies**]{.underline}

[Although Brexit was initially a result of weak leadership]{.underline}
in London, [it should serve as a warning against both an "ever closer
union" and a]{.underline} ["union of different
speeds."]{.underline} [Centralization was the
cause](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/shortsightedness-and-stubbornness-are-holding-europe-back,2646,c.html) of
the outcome of the Brexit referendum. The problem of
potentially [excessive
centralization](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/the-eus-tilt-toward-centralization,2414,c.html) is
a consequence of weak leadership and expedient policies in member
states, which allows for excessive rules, regulation and centralized
power.

Discriminating measures

A few years ago, Europe's central authorities (a majority in the
European Council) decided to allocate migrants among member states,
often against those countries' wishes. "Solidarity" was the pretext. The
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland objected and refused to take in those
migrants. Last week the Advocate General, an advisory body to the
European Court of Justice (ECJ), issued an opinion that the three
countries can be fined and forced to accept the arbitrary quota. The ECJ
is not obliged to follow the Advocate General's opinions, but usually
does. Interfering in the population policy of individual member states
will undoubtedly be perceived as crossing a red line. A ruling is
expected early next year.

Again, **[the problem is one of weak leadership]{.underline}**. Since at
least the 1990s, it had been evident that a wave of migration from
Africa would eventually come. There is no reason Europe -- especially
the European Commission, the Mediterranean states and larger countries
such as Germany -- should have been surprised. Still, no preventive
measures were taken. Instead Brussels, Berlin and Paris sent messages
that encouraged the migrants.

[Today, a bureaucratic paradise is being installed on global,
supranational and national levels]{.underline}

There are plenty of other examples showing how [Europe's central
authorities discriminate against member state]{.underline}s. The
**[reams of red tape]{.underline}** that [hinder emerging economies come
to mind]{.underline}, such as new rules on posting workers that grossly
violate the freedom of exchange of services.

Losing trust

[Europe should be flourishing.]{.underline} The above-mentioned
discriminatory measures (just a few of the striking ones among many)
harm Europe. [Weak political leadership results in **excessive
control**,]{.underline} less freedom **[and [bureaucratic
overreach](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/opinion-putting-europe-back-on-track,politics,2359.html)]{.underline}**.

[People have increasingly begun to worry about security and
prosperity]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline} --
[unfortunately]{.underline}, somewhat [justifiably]{.underline} --
[losing trust in]{.underline} democratic [institutions]{.underline} due
to weak leadership and oversized bureaucracy. As happens so often
throughout history, grand initiatives and shining achievements are
suffocated by their own institutions.

[None of China's remarkable achievements]{.underline}, however,
necessarily [portend Chinese world domination]{.underline}, not even
hegemony in Asia.14 To begin with, [China suffers from **acute
structural vulnerabilities**]{.underline}, including [an impending
**demographic winter**]{.underline}15 (i.e. that the aging population
will surpass the working population within this decade) [and excessively
leveraged financial sector, which foretell an almost **inevitable

significant]{.underline}, if not **[widening]{.underline}**,
**[gap]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} more developed rivals such as
[the United States, which still boasts the **largest pool** of

As structural realities catch up with China's maturing economy, and [the

and ethnocentric nationalistic discourse, as we have seen during Hong
Kong protests and more recently amid the pandemic.20 More crucially,
[China's geopolitical assertiveness has provoked backlash across the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, most prominently in the U.S., where there is
an emerging bipartisan consensus on the need to craft a robust
corresponding strategy. In a sign of the changing times, even former

which have stepped up their military presence]{.underline} and strategic
countermeasures in the Asia-Pacific region.24

Regional Conflict

One common argument is that [BRI projects are subject to the risks of
operating in **conflictprone areas**]{.underline}. Lin Limin, director
of CICIR's Foreign Strategy Research Center, assesses that [the SREB
traverses a "**geopolitical black hole**,]{.underline}" marked by
unstable regimes and rampant corruption. This has led many investors to
"turn back," and made it difficult to launch a high-speed rail
network.70 Major General Wang Weixing, director of the Foreign Military
Studies Department at the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), likewise
notes that "[the BRI route passes through many geopolitically fragile
areas, with complex historical issues, intense ethnic and religious
disputes, and frequent armed conflict]{.underline}."71 In another
article, Wang argues that "religious violence," in particular, can
"completely throw the BRI's construction into chaos and threaten the
security of our investment projects and personnel."72

Chinese scholars often focus on discord in specific subregions. These
include the following:

■ **[Middle East/North Africa.]{.underline}** Tian Wenlin, a Middle East
specialist at CICIR, assesses that [since the Arab Spring, the Middle
East has entered its "most turbulent period since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}." Specific challenges endangering infrastructure
development include [increasing violence between Shia and Sunni
factions]{.underline}, especially [between Iran and Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}; the [rise of separatism in areas such as southern
Yemen and Libya]{.underline}; and the IS desire to form a state, which
has split parts of Iraq and Syria.73 Other scholars note the negative
consequence of the Syrian refugee crisis on Europe, which [will
complicate BRI projects]{.underline} in both regions.74 For instance, Hu
Bo argues:

> If West Asian and North African trends are not slowly alleviated,
> refugees could come swarming forward and seriously endanger eastern
> Europe, southern Europe, even western European countries' governments
> and social stability, be a burden on economic development, and cause
> extremist and terrorist ideology to spread . . . and in Europe some
> right-wing powers still might use the confusion caused by the refugee
> crisis and dissatisfaction in society to change a part of the
> country's domestic governance structure.75

In the maritime domain, Fu Mengzi and Lou Chunhao note that sectarian
conflict in places such as Yemen and Somalia could threaten the region's
key sea lanes, such as the Strait of Hormuz, and thus the viability of
the MSR.76

■ South/Central Asia. Chen Xiangyang, deputy director of CICIR's
Institute of World Politics, assesses that a reduction of U.S. forces
will negatively impact the security situation in Afghanistan and
"surrounding countries," which could pose dangers for BRI projects in
the region (including Pakistan).77 Fu Mengzi and Lou Chunhao write that
[an intensifying India-Pakistan conflict, reflected in an October 2014
border incident in Kashmir that was the deadliest since 2003, will
threaten projects under both CPEC]{.underline} and the BCIM economic
corridor.78

■ [Southeast Asia]{.underline}. Senior Colonel Li Daguang of China's NDU
describes Southeast Asia as a "very unstable strategic direction,"
involving a recent [escalation of South China Sea territorial disputes
and challenges from Vietnam and the Philippines, which could threaten
the development of the MSR]{.underline}.79 Wang Weixing writes that
[internal instability in Thailand led to the cancellation of a
China-Thailand high-speed rail plan]{.underline}, while internal
conflict in Myanmar has led to dams and copper mine projects being
halted.80

Nontraditional Security Challenges

A related issue is the impact of nontraditional security challenges on
BRI projects. Perhaps the most commonly cited problem in the Chinese
literature is the threat of terrorism and violent extremism. Some
scholars contend that [extremists might oppose the BRI on ideological
grounds, since economic development strengthens existing
regimes]{.underline}, whereas radical groups often seek to subvert
them.81 Wang Yiwei also notes that development makes it harder for
extremists to recruit new members and influence public opinion.82 [BRI
projects and workers might make attractive targets for financially
motivated attacks, including kidnappings for ransom and theft of
property, such as drilling machinery, oil, and communications
equipment.]{.underline}83 Aside from direct losses, [attacks could also
impose indirect economic costs as firms spend more on security services
and insurance premiums rise]{.underline}.84

Several specific groups are repeatedly identified in Chinese
assessments. Those include:

■ [Turkistan Islamic Party]{.underline} (TIP). One CICIR terrorism
specialist claims that the Uighur separatist group TIP (known in China
as the East Turkestan Independence Movement) has been "hiding out" in
South Asia and forming "symbiotic relationships with local terrorists,"
which [could impact the BRI's implementation in the
region]{.underline}.85 Likewise, a terrorism scholar at the Northwest
University of Politics and Law suggests [that TIP is seeking to expand
its influence into Southeast Asia, and could threaten Chinese workers
involved in BRI projects]{.underline}, including through
hostage-taking.86 Chen Xiangyang states that [Uighur forces both in and
outside of China launch periodic terrorist attacks, "threatening the
personal safety and property of Chinese nationals]{.underline}."87

■ IS. Zhang Jie, a scholar at the CASS National Institute of
International Strategy, contends that foreign pressure on IS in Iraq and
Syria is leading the group to expand globally and encourage "lone wolf "
attacks on targets in other countries. Based on these threats, the
"risks facing Chinese personnel and investments cannot be
underestimated."88 Tian Wenlin argues that the [IS desire to gain
control of oil fields in the Middle East conflicts with China's
interests in oil development as part of the BRI.]{.underline} Another
concern is that [IS could influence rebel groups in Pakistani tribal
regions, thus expanding the security risks facing CPEC]{.underline}.89

■ [Pakistani Insurgents/Taliban]{.underline}. One [CICIR South Asia
specialist portrays the security situation in Baluchistan, where Gwadar
and other major CPEC projects are located, as **especially
dangerous**]{.underline}, recalling that [Baluchi insurgents have a
history of attacking infrastructure projects]{.underline}, including one
2006 assault that resulted in the deaths of three Chinese engineers.90
He also notes increasing activities by insurgent and Pakistani Taliban
forces in Sindh Province, site of various transportation and energy
projects under CPEC.91 A Central Party School researcher also assesses
[that insurgency poses "uncontrollable risks" to CPEC in tribal regions,
blaming the Pakistani government for approving routes through these
areas for political reasons]{.underline}.92 However, in interviews in
2017, several Chinese South Asia scholars downplayed the risks to
Chinese personnel in Pakistan, pointing to a decline in the number of
terrorist attacks in recent years.93

While most Chinese writings focus on terrorist threats to overseas
interests, some also discuss the impact on China itself. Li Daguang
notes that [terrorists based in Central Asia and Afghanistan could
launch **new attacks in Xinjiang**]{.underline}, which is [a focal point
for BRI investment within China]{.underline}.94 Tian Wenlin writes that
IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi envisioned that Xinjiang would become
part of a new Islamic caliphate, which could prompt further IS
involvement in China's northwest.95 A CASS scholar similarly predicts
that [Xinjiang could be threatened by Islamic militants returning from
IS-held territories in the Middle East]{.underline}.96 More generally, a
researcher at the AMS Border and Coastal Defense Research Center argues
that [implementing the BRI could pose **new threats to China's border
security**]{.underline}, [including **terrorism and international
crime**]{.underline}, and create new requirements, such as for maritime
search and rescue.97 Chinese sources also discuss several other
nontraditional security problems. First is piracy. [Senior]{.underline}
Colonel Liang Fang, a professor at the PLA NDU, describes piracy as a
major issue along several parts of the MSR, stating that around 20
percent of Chinese ships in the Gulf of Aden have been attacked, while
seven have been hijacked.98 CICIR analysts also describe an increase in
the incidence of piracy in the South China Sea, where 124 incidents were
reported in 2014.99 Second is drug trafficking, which Wang Weixing notes
led to a 2011 plot to kill 13 Chinese sailors on the Mekong River in
Myanmar.100 The third problem is environmental risks. One scholar, for
instance, argues that mudslides and other natural disasters resulting
from climate change could impact BRI projects "in the construction and
implementation phase."101

Despite these observations, a gap in the literature concerns the
possibility that [Chinese policies and practices themselves might be
**contributing to these risks.**]{.underline} For instance, Wang Yiwei
notes that [local civil society groups, such as human rights or
environmental activists, might instigate **protests against BRI
projects**]{.underline}, but sees this as a result of conspiracies by
"the Western world" to frustrate China's ambitions rather than local
anti-China sentiment.102 Wang and other scholars do not acknowledge that
[many incidents targeting overseas Chinese interests have arisen from
policies such as the exclusive use of Chinese workers, poor working
conditions for local employees, and collusion with corrupt local
offici]{.underline}als.103 Neither do they consider how [restrictive
policies on Uighur minorities might be **increasing the prospects for
violent incidents in Xinjiang**]{.underline}. Lack of critical
self-reflection means that China's security community may not fully
appreciate the sources of violence along BRI routes.

WASHINGTON --- [The Department of Defense unveiled a
**multimillion-dollar 5G challenge**]{.underline} this week
[that]{.underline} it says [will promote the growth and adoption of a
fifth-generation open ecosystem and related technologies]{.underline}.

[The competition]{.underline}, conducted in collaboration with the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, [focuses on
open interfaces, swappable and compatible parts, and the development of
a diverse, multi-vendor community]{.underline}.

[Participants]{.underline} who submit hardware or software solutions for
5G network subsystems that meet exacting criteria [will be eligible for
awards of up to **\$3 million**]{.underline}, the Pentagon said in an
April 6 announcement.

Amanda [Toman, DoD's]{.underline} acting [principal director of
**5G**]{.underline} and similar capabilities, in a statement [said the
department "is committed to supporting innovation efforts that
accelerate the **domestic development** of 5G]{.underline} and future-G
technologies. [5G is **too critical** a technology sector to
**relinquish** to countries whose products and technologies are **not**
aligned with **our standards** of privacy and
**security**]{.underline}."

Fifth-generation wireless technology boasts boosted bandwidth, reduced
latency and much faster speeds compared to its predecessors. Those
factors make 5G --- and what comes after --- critical to the Defense
Department, which has increasingly emphasized the importance of
unrestricted and speedy information sharing.

A closed-off, siloed wireless industry has driven up costs, hamstrung
innovation and dulled competition, according to the Pentagon, and the
new challenge aims to change that. The National Telecommunications and
Information Administration in a video published April 6 said the Defense
Department, international allies, network operators and consumers will
benefit.

"We will continue our support of all necessary efforts to unleash
innovation while developing secure 5G supply chains," Toman said.

The [Defense Department]{.underline} in 2020 [said it would invest
**\$600 million** in **5G testbeds**]{.underline} at five military
installations [across the U.S.]{.underline} Additional investments were
made in 2021.

More recently, the [Defense Department announced the establishment of a
5G and Future-G Cross Functional Team that will work to ensure U.S.
forces can operate anywhere]{.underline}, including in environments
where networks are contested and communication is difficult.

["Today's operational requirements call for the acceleration of 5G
technology]{.underline} with at-scale prototyping and experimentation,"
[Toman said]{.underline} in a **[March 9]{.underline}** statement. "[The
5G]{.underline} and Future Generation CFT [will play a **critical role**
in advancing the department's 5G and future generation
capabilities]{.underline}."

Applications for the challenge are open through May 5.

selected a **dozen military installations** as test beds for
5G]{.underline}, including sites in California, Georgia and Virginia.
[This month, the department unveiled a **multimillion-dollar challenge**
to accelerate the growth and adoption of a fifth-generation open

The service believes smart warehouses could boost the efficiency and
fidelity of its logistics.

"When we first started experimenting and piloting in 5G," Galbraith said
Tuesday, "we looked at what our priorities were."

No wonder, then, that [the U.S. **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense,
through an initiative called **5G to NextG**]{.underline}, and various
complementary investments from individual armed services, [has
**committed**]{.underline} upwards of US [**\$2 billion** to advance
commercial **5G research** and to perform **tests** and **experiments**
to adapt the results for military purposes]{.underline}.

#### Military 5G funding is inevitable.

Amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics. In the 2020s, that
old chestnut should probably be updated: \"Professionals talk about the
network.\"

And boy are they talking. [The U.S. government will be one of
the [**biggest
spenders**](https://tbri.com/special-reports/private-5g-networks-market-will-see-strong-growth-as-a-broad-range-of-industries-and-governments-adopt-the-technology/) on
private 5G infrastructure]{.underline}, and [the Department of Defense
**leads the pack**]{.underline}. [DoD\'s growing network demands include
connecting in-field technology as well as supporting day-to-day base
**operations** and force **training**]{.underline}. DoD\'s need for
increased connectivity is driving greater investment in 4G LTE, but
that\'s only laying the foundation for a massive shift to 5G.

It turns out [that shift is **already underway**]{.underline}. According
to Lt Col Brandon Newell, Director, SoCal Tech Bridge, NavalX, since
July of this year [the 5G Living Lab]{.underline} aboard MCAS Miramar,
[a partnership with Verizon, has been active, representing the first 5G
Ultra Wideband mmWave deployment on a military installation in the
nation]{.underline}.

\"[Our intent is to **embrace 5G-enabled tech**]{.underline} that is
being [used to advance commercial industries]{.underline} as a weapon in
the Defense Market,\" [says Lt Col Newell. \"We are embarking to explore
base resilience]{.underline} through energy management and
communications, [**security** through what we call \'the digital
fortress,\']{.underline} and mobility across modalities such as
autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial systems.\"

In other words, [5G will serve as the **undergirding** for a **new
generation of warfighting**]{.underline}.

\"More so than with other technologies in the past, we\'re seeing that
[the Department of Defense (DoD)]{.underline} and military leaders
[realize how important 5G is for their departments and are **eager** to
**adopt it**]{.underline},\" says Nick Nilan, Director of Product
Development, Public Sector for Verizon, who helped me understand the
scope of adoption. \"Military leaders across the country are improving
their infrastructure so they are ready to take advantage of 5G.
Widespread cloud adoption over the last few years has also driven an
increased demand for better connectivity. In order to access information
in the cloud anywhere, anytime, you need better connectivity -- you need
5G.\"

#### Current DOD 5G thumps.

[The Department of Defense has ambitious plans]{.underline} to leverage
**[5G communications tech]{.underline}**nology for a wide variety of use
cases to include back-office functions, [**logistics,** training and
**warfighting.**]{.underline} However, a great deal of [**work remains**
to be done by government and industry to ensure those systems and
networks will be **secure and interoperable** when they are deployed,
according to a top National Security Agency official.]{.underline}

The Pentagon has a number of 5G pilot projects underway. In the future,
observers can expect a "full wave" of these next-generation capabilities
to be fielded, said Neal Ziring, technical director of the cybersecurity
directorate at NSA.

"We're looking at our biggest customers, the \[military\] services, and
saying, 'Wow, they're rushing headlong towards 5G,'" Ziring said
Wednesday during a luncheon hosted by AFCEA.

NSA wants to help. To that end, a number of [steps need to be taken to
meet the **security**, **interoperability** and **deployability**
requirements for defense applications]{.underline}, he noted.

One is ensuring the right standards are in place. A number of
organizations are involved in setting those standards.

"Those standards bodies define [how the 5G gear works
together]{.underline}. So, [NSA and other parts of the DOD]{.underline}
and parts of the industrial base who are represented here today,
especially the telecommunications carriers, [are active in]{.underline}
that environment [trying to make sure that those standards have security
baked into them so that all the equipment we buy from whatever
vendor]{.underline} ... have the security in it that we need, and that
we can turn it on or request that our industry service providers make
full use of it in providing service to defense," Ziring said.

Another key component of the next-gen communications technology will be
a concept known as **[network slicing]{.underline}**, which will enable
service providers to set up independent logical networks across the same
5G infrastructure.

"They sort of have it a little bit in 4G, but it's a big feature in 5G,"
Ziring said. "We think that's [going to be **really important for**
pretty much all the **defense** use cases]{.underline}."

Managers [can designate specific network "slices"]{.underline} for
certain users or certain devices, and then [provide levels of security
protection, isolation or access to only the authorized members of that
slice]{.underline}, he explained.

USG systems must be able to determine that an attack, malicious event,
or exploitation is in progress to take timely actions to ensure system
resilience. To identify early warning of an anomaly or attack, US
entities must understand their standard day-to-day environment, sense
that something is out of the ordinary, and determine what is happening
across the digital domain.\[37\] Additionally, [as **DoD** implements
equipment that can leverage the **5G** wireless
infrastructure]{.underline}, military communications operators need to
be trained and have the right tools to detect outside influence. Once an
attack is identified, the more difficult task is attributing the
activity to a malicious actor and then identifying the attack vector. To
accomplish this, DoD should improve training programs for its cyber
warriors and develop tools that can detect anomalies and potentially
take the first steps in countering cyber-attacks. [To help **identify
attack vectors** and determine where an attack came from,]{.underline}
**[new authorities]{.underline}** or adjustment to current authorities
[may be required]{.underline}, especially if autonomous actions are
incorporated into these systems.

We determined that as of June 2, 2022, the Office of the Under Secretary
of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, DoD, (OUSD\[C\]/CFO)
has implemented procedures for DoD Components to follow in reporting
through Advancing Analytics (Advana) the execution of the [**\$6.5
billion** in funds appropriated to the DoD to provide assistance to
**Ukraine**]{.underline}.1 OUSD(C)/CFO personal implemented processes to
help ensure DoD Components are reporting, through their respective
accounting systems, the transactions supporting the assistance the DoD
is providing to Ukraine. However, the DoD's use of systems that are not
able to directly feed into Advana could limit the transparency of the
execution of the Ukraine supplemental funds.

Background

The [President enacted the **Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations
Act**]{.underline}, 2022 (the Act) on March 15, 2022 [as part of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act]{.underline}, 2022.2 [Congress
designates each amount provided by the Act as being for an emergency
requirement]{.underline}.3 [The Act provided the DoD with \$6.528
billion in funds for assistance to Ukraine]{.underline}, specifically:

• [\$3.028 billion]{.underline} directly appropriated [for U.S. European
Command operations mission support, the deployment of personnel to the
region, and intelligence support]{.underline}; and

• [\$3.500 billion of reprogramming funds to replace the DoD's stocks,
and to reimburse the DoD for defense services, education, and training
provided to Ukraine.]{.underline}

The [Act requires that the \$3.5 billion remain available for transfer
under the appropriation "Operation and Maintenance,
Defense‑Wide."]{.underline} These funds may only be transferred to
accounts under the heading "Operation and Maintenance" and "Procurement"
for the replacement of defense articles from DoD stocks and
reimbursement for services. Furthermore, the Act requires the Secretary
of Defense to notify the congressional defense committees of the details
of transfers at least 30 days before any transfer, and the funds
transferred must be used for the same purposes and same period as the
appropriations to which the funds are transferred.

National Security Concerns

According to a DIB assessment, [China is the current leader]{.underline}
in sub-6 technologies and is likely to deploy the world's first 5G
wide-area network. [Chinese companies]{.underline}, which [often receive
government subsidies]{.underline} (e.g., subsidized land for facilities,
R&D grants), are therefore well-positioned as [global 5G
suppliers]{.underline}. [**Huawei** has signed contracts for the
**construction** of 5G infrastructure in around **30 countries,**
including Iceland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.]{.underline} Some
experts are concerned that vulnerabilities in Chinese equipment [could
be used to conduct cyberattacks or military/industrial
espionage]{.underline}. These experts claim [vulnerabilities
were]{.underline} introduced through the poor business practices of many
Chinese companies. However, they note that vulnerabilities could also be
[intentionally introduced for malicious purposes]{.underline}. [China's
National Intelligence Law]{.underline}, enacted in June 2017, declares
that "any organization and citizen shall, in accordance with the law,
support, provide assistance, and cooperate in national intelligence
work, and guard the secrecy of any national intelligence work that they
are aware of." Some analysts interpret this law as [requiring Chinese
companies to cooperate with intelligence services, including compelling
installation of backdoors to provide private data to the
government]{.underline}. Other analysts argue that the risks posed by
Chinese telecommunications equipment vary depending on the equipment's
location within the cellular network architecture. Most cellular
networks are broken into two groups: the core network, which provides
the gateway to the internet and ensures devices meet the provider's
standards, and the radio access network, composed of the cellular towers
that broadcast and receive radio signals (see Figure 2). These analysts
state that, while the risks posed by Chinese core networks are
significant, the risks posed by Chinese radio access networks could be
managed. Other analysts have argued that having any [Chinese equipment
in the network could pose potential security concerns]{.underline}. Such
concerns have prompted some analysts to argue that [the United States
should limit intelligence sharing with any country operating
Chinese-supplied 5G equipment.]{.underline} In response to these
national security concerns, Congress passed the Secure 5G and Beyond Act
of 2020 (P.L. 116- 129), requiring the President to develop a strategy
to protect 5G systems and infrastructure in the United States and assist
allies and partners in their own protection efforts. The Administration
released its 5G strategy in March 2020. Similarly, in Section 254 of the
FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-92), [**Congress
directed DOD** to develop a strategy **to harness 5G "to enhance
military capabilities**, maintain a technological advantage on the
battlefield, and accelerate the deployment of new commercial products
and services enabled by 5G networks throughout the Department of
Defense."]{.underline} DOD released an unclassified version of this
strategy in May 2020.

[Implications for Military Operations]{.underline}

[5G tech]{.underline}nologies could have [a number of potential military
applications, particularly for **autonomous vehicles**, **C2**,
**logistics**, maintenance, augmented and **v**irtual **r**eality, and
**ISR systems**]{.underline}---[all of which would benefit from improved
data rates and lower latency (time delay)]{.underline}. [Autonomous
military vehicles,]{.underline} like their commercial counterparts,
[could potentially **circumvent on-board data** processing limitations
by storing large databases]{.underline} (e.g., maps) in the cloud. Safe
vehicle operations would require 5G's high data rates and low latency to
download off-board information and synthesize it with on-board sensor
data. Likewise, 5G could be used to transfer sensor data between
operators and uninhabited vehicles and to network vehicles, potentially
enabling new military concepts of operations, such as swarming (i.e.,
cooperative behavior in which vehicles autonomously coordinate to
achieve a task). 5G technologies could also be incorporated into ISR
systems, which increasingly demand high-bandwidths to process, exploit,
and disseminate information from a growing number of battlespace
sensors. This could provide commanders with timely access to actionable
intelligence data, in turn improving operational decisionmaking.
Similarly, [5G could **reduce latency** in other data-intensive
activities, such as **logistics** and **maintenance**, and could
additionally enable augmented or virtual reality environments that could
enhance training.]{.underline} Finally, command and control systems
could benefit from the high speed, low latency capability of 5G. For
example, the U.S. military currently uses satellite communications for
most of its long-distance communications. However, satellites on orbit
can significantly increase latency due to the amount of distance a
signal needs to travel, causing delays in the execution of military
operations. Although [**DOD** is in the initial stages of **testing and
experimentation for 5G**]{.underline} applications, it has selected 12
military installations as test beds: Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany,
GA, and Naval Base San Diego, CA ("smart warehouses"); Hill Air Force
Base, UT ("spectrum sharing between 5G and airborne radar"); Joint Base
LewisMcChord, WA ("augmented and virtual reality"); Nellis Air Force
Base, NV ("survivable command and control and network enhancement");
Naval Base Norfolk, VA ("shipwide and pier connectivity"); Joint Base
Pearl HarborHickam, HI ("enhancing aircraft mission readiness"); Joint
Base San Antonio, TX ("augmented reality support of maintenance and
training" and "evaluating DOD\'s 5G core security experimentation
network"); Tinker Air Force Base, OK ("spectrum sharing between military
communications and 5G"); and Camp Pendleton, CA; Ft. Hood, TX; and Ft.
Irwin National Training Center, CA ("connectivity for forward operating
bases and tactical operations centers"). On September 18, 2020, DOD
issued a request for information to better understand dynamic spectrum
sharing for 5G technologies. DOD requested \$1.5 billion for 5G and
microelectronics in FY2021.
