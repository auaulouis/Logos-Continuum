#### EU strategic autonomy is [impossible]{.underline} -- practical obstacles and inevitable [reliance on NATO]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [at the strategic level, the [EU--NATO relationship
remains]{.mark} absolutely [fundamental to]{.mark} the future of the
[European security and defence]{.mark} project for two interconnected
and seemingly incompatible reasons]{.underline}. The first is the very
existence of [NATO]{.underline}, its history, its mythology and its
political reality: an alliance that, unlike any other in history, [has
outlived the demise of the threat against which it was initially
created. This has been in very large part due to US leadership and to
the perceived usefulness of NATO to American global
strategy]{.underline}. US leadership has had, as an inevitable
corollary, European followership. Whatever the specifics of the constant
tensions over burden-sharing, American leadership has generated a degree
of demotivation on the part of Europeans, which US commentators have
castigated as "free-riding". At the same time, since the end of the Cold
War, [there have been growing demands, in Washington, for the EU to take
over greater direct responsibility for the stabilisation of its volatile
neighbourhood]{.underline} (the Balkans, the Maghreb and the Eastern
borderlands). Europe, since 1989, has ceased to be central to the US
strategic radar screen. This has given rise to the various projects for
a European defence capacity, both from within NATO (the short-lived
attempt, in the 1990s, to form a European Security and Defence Identity
-- ESDI) (Howorth and Keeler 2003), and outside of NATO (the 20-year
quest for a Common Security and Defence Policy -- CSDP) (Howorth 2014).
However, [[so long as US policy suggests]{.mark} that [Uncle Sam will
always be on hand]{.mark} [to ensure European security]{.mark} if a
serious crisis develops, [there will **inevitably be** ]{.mark}**clear
[limits]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [ambition of]{.mark} the [purely
European project]{.mark}]{.underline}.

From this perspective, the "micro-cooperation" that forms the focus of
some articles in this special issue (in particular, Smith et al. 2017,
Graeger 2017), is only one part of the challenge. Arguably, as Duke and
Gebhard (2017) suggest in this volume, and as the case studies of Fiott
(2017), Lavallée (2017), Mayer (2017) conclude, of even greater
long-term concern is the overall nature of the relationship between
these two security actors. What is each of them for? Why does Europe
need two such entities? Should ever greater cooperation lead to a formal
division of labour or to a radically new balance of responsibilities and
commitment as between the US and the Europeans[?]{.underline}

When the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CSDP) was first
launched in December 1998, the key concept was "autonomous action". The
EU, it was asserted, would develop its own strategic vision. The
European framework would allow the member states to generate serious
military capacity, whereas in NATO they would simply free-ride. And CSDP
would allow European forces to tackle regional security challenges the
US did not wish to engage with. Alas, CSDP did none of those things.
Almost two decades later, the [EU Global Strategy asserted that the EU's
foreign and security policy goal remains "strategic
autonomy"]{.underline}. If words have meaning, this suggests an ambition
for Europe to become self-reliant in defence. The reality, [[as we have
seen in Libya]{.mark} and [Ukrain]{.mark}e, [and]{.mark} as it is lived
by [member states with a Russian border]{.mark}, is that [Europe]{.mark}
appears to be [more **dependent on NATO**]{.mark} and the US [than at
any point since]{.mark} the 19[80s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet Donald
Trump has called NATO obsolete, thereby significantly intensifying the
European drive for a new defence capacity (Trump 2016). And his view is
by no means marginal in the US. Major International Relations scholars
such as Barry Posen (2014), Andrew Bacevich (2016), John Mearsheimer and
Stephen Walt (2016) have recently called for the US progressively to
withdraw from NATO and to hand it over, lock stock and barrel, to the
Europeans. How likely is such a scenario and what are the alternatives?

In May 2017, Angela Merkel, deploring Trump's berating of the European
allies at the previous week's NATO summit, famously declared that "the
era in which we could fully rely on others is over to some extent"
(Merkel 2017). The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude
Juncker, even suggested that European integration itself could be
re-kick-started via the drive for defence integration (Juncker 2017).
And yet, [all these voices continue to insist that cooperation between
the EU and NATO is vital to this process]{.underline}. How can the
aspiration for autonomy coexist with intensified cooperation? If the EU
actually achieves strategic autonomy, what is NATO for? Conversely, if
the EU does not achieve strategic autonomy, what is CSDP for? Europeans
need to be totally realistic. [There are **[huge obstacles]{.mark}**
standing [in the way of "strategic autonomy":]{.mark} persistent
[nationalist reflexes]{.mark} from member states; significant
[divergences in]{.mark} European [strategic cultures]{.mark}; [lack of
consensus]{.mark} about the level of ambition in this policy area;
[challenges to defence budgets]{.mark} in a time of austerity; the
[sheer scale of]{.mark} the [challenges]{.mark} facing Europe in its
Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods; the absence of public awareness of
and/or support for a more muscular or assertive Europe; [and above all
the **parallel existence of NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I see three
scenarios for the future of EU--NATO relations.

#### European crises have empirically inspired an increase in [EU-NATO collaboration]{.underline} -- proven by [cybersecurity]{.underline} threats

Nina **Graeger 17**, Senior Research Fellow at the Norwegian Institute
of International Affairs (NUPI), where she was Head of Department from
2008 to 2013 and Associate Professor II in International Relations at
the Norwegian University of Life Sciences since 2013, "Grasping the
everyday and extraordinary in EU--NATO relations: the added value of
practice approaches", 08/17/2017, European Security 26(3), p. 340-358
/lg

Studying the EU--NATO relationship as practice enables the researcher to
transcend the extraordinary-everyday dichotomy but also to overcome the
arguably "hyped-up" focus on the extraordinary in security and strategic
studies. While designed to provide a (rapid) response to an
extraordinary situation or event, [[security]{.mark} production
[involves practices that are]{.mark} ordinary, [day-to-day]{.mark}
experiences]{.underline} and where social artefacts constitute an
essential part[. [In the EU--NATO relationship]{.mark}, such artefacts
include everything from meeting agendas, reports, and informal memos
exchanged between EU and NATO staff and diplomats, informal briefings by
EU commanders in the North Atlantic Council (NAC) or by NATO commanders
in the EU Political and Security Committee (PSC), as well as mutual
visits to EU and NATO vessels at sea]{.underline} in the anti-piracy or
refugee operations (Græger 2016).7.

However[, [crises]{.mark} may also [strengthen and expand]{.mark} the
repertoire of [everyday security practice]{.mark}. The Russian
[annexation of]{.mark} the [Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 [put]{.mark} the
relevance of [EU--NATO cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, also for
territorial security[, [back on the political
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 [Both the [EU]{.mark} High Representative
for the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice President of
the European Commission [and]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} Secretary General
have [emphasised that a more]{.mark} uncertain and [hostile European
security]{.mark} [environment is a challenge that their]{.mark}
respective [organisations should **handle
together**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mogherini 2014, NATO 2016a, 2016b).
Since 2014, EU and NATO representatives have met informally on several
occasions to exchange views, discuss common or coordinated responses,
and convey joint messages to the external world.9

[[This is not]{.mark} an entirely [new]{.mark} phenomenon]{.underline},
however. [[Crises, especially when Europe is expected to]{.mark} [take
a]{.mark} stand or a specific [role]{.mark}, [have **facilitated
EU--NATO communication**]{.mark}]{.underline} and opened up meeting
arenas that the "Cyprus issue" has otherwise rendered inaccessible. For
instance, reciprocal informal cross-briefings and meetings between the
ambassadors in the NAC and the PSC happened during "the Arab Spring" and
the Libya operations during 2011, as well as when violence broke out on
the ground in Kosovo in 2007 and in 2012 (Græger 2016). Although the
frameworks for the coordination of defence, capability development,
training of personnel etc. established as part of the Berlin Plus
Agreement and Agreed Framework have been blocked since 2005, the member
states of both organisations generally have turned a blind eye to
practical cooperation as long as it generates results and is conducted
discretely, sensitively, and without serious incidents (Smith 2011, p.
255).10 [At the operational level, EU and NATO staff have found ways of
working alongside each other]{.underline} or together both in crisis
management operations, support missions (e.g. handling refugees), and
anti-piracy operations.

Practice approaches are able to capture the essence of these informal
encounters, which constitute the intersubjective understandings of
security and how to handle them, whether as part of the everyday
production of security or a response to major crises[.]{.underline}

The perceived strategic uncertainty in Europe the past years surely has
securitised EU--NATO cooperation, rendering an expansion of cooperation
outside of Berlin Plus politically desirable and possible. [New
[threats, such as "hybrid warfare" and
cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also energy-security, capacity
building in third countries, and illegal migration and refugee [flows
**[opened]{.mark} [up]{.mark}** new areas of practical
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In responding to the refugee
crisis from 2015, [NATO and the EU signed an agreement in March 2016,
emphasising that they had reached a "common understanding]{.underline}"
on the modalities of the cooperation. In practical terms, it implied
ensuring consistency and complementarity of the Frontex operation and
NATO's support activities (European Commission 2016). [[New initiatives
regarding]{.mark} [information sharing and]{.mark} incident response
coordination [between NATO and the EU have]{.mark} also [been made
within]{.mark} the [cyber security]{.mark} domain (]{.underline}EEAS
2016). These agreements and coordination of activity are examples of
everyday practice that originates in the extraordinary.

#### NATO and the EU are [intertwined]{.underline} when it comes to security and defense -- overlap, liaison offices, and formal agreements make [cooperation]{.underline} frequent

Increasing interactions and functional overlap depend, however, also on
the distribution of power among the two organisations, which can either
be symmetric or asymmetric. Traditionally, power is in the hands of
states with autonomy over decision-making and it has been distinguished
between "power over", power exerted by one actor over another in a
relationship, and "power to", the ability to trigger change and shape
certain outcomes (Ojanen 2018). In this context, power of an
organisation denotes "its ability to retain, or expand, its capability
to pursue its policies within the area of functional overlap". Under an
asymmetric power distribution, a so-called "sectoral specialisation" of
the organisations is most likely to happen because the weaker
organisation needs to withdraw its governance activities from the
respective policy area (Gehring and Faude 2014, p. 479). In the case of
a symmetric power distribution, both organisations need to coordinate
their governance activities in the overlapping policy area. Herein,
multiple members -- those states that are members of more than one
international organisation within the same interorganisational network
-- play a crucial role as they can negotiate the institutional
arrangements within both organisations to avoid conflicts and
malfunctions of the regulatory bodies. Under symmetrical power
distribution, co-governance and a division of labour are more likely to
occur than role specification (Gehring and Faude 2014). Accordingly,
Gehring and Faude propose "that institutional adaptation gives rise to
an institutionalised division of labour among the elemental institutions
of an institutional complex" (2014, p. 482). Division of labour then
results in enhanced cooperation and fostered exchanges. [In the case of
the [EU and NATO]{.mark}, their [functional overlaps have increased over
time]{.mark} as both have actively collaborated, [for example]{.mark},
in crisis management operations [in Bosnia]{.mark} and Herzegovina
[and]{.mark} off the [Somali coast]{.mark}. As a result, [they have
become]{.mark} so-called [**interlocking institutions** due to]{.mark}
their [increasing coordination and cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Biermann 2009, Schleich 2014).

Interorganisational interactions are not a one-way street and can take
different forms including exchanges of information and material
resources, coordination of activities, joint activities and
decision-making and the establishment of formal structures (cf. Biermann
2008, 2015). Interorganisational relations may also go a step further in
which one organisation can influence and shape the other's policies,
procedures and institutions, leading to a process of socialisation and
learning from the other organisation (Johnston 2001). While learning can
be accelerated through the rotation and exchange of staff members, the
so-called alumni effect (Koops 2017a, 2017b), it can also be prevented
by communication problems, lack of implementation and shortage of
resources[.]{.underline}

Since interorganisational relations are a dynamic process of exchanges
and coordination, they take place on different levels within the
organisations. Building on Waltz (1959) distinction of three levels of
analysis -- international system, state and individual --
interorganisational interactions occur within the network of IOs in the
same policy area (international system level), are shaped by their
member states as well as by individual key players within the
organisations and their member states. Koops (2017a, 2017b) introduces
two additional levels: the bureaucratic level and the inter-secretariat
(also called inter-institutional) level. While the bureaucratic level
refers to administrative structures within IOs, where decisions are
taken and the day-to-day management occurs, the inter-secretariat level
includes jointly created cooperation channels, such as working groups
and steering committees that oversee the formal cooperation in an
interorganisational relationship[. [Liaison committees]{.mark} and
working groups in the case of EU-NATO cooperation [have played]{.mark}
particularly [relevant roles]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example[, the EU
and NATO introduced and actively engaged via their liaison facilities
since 2000 with a focus on capabilities which later resulted in the
creation of the EU-NATO Capability Group]{.underline} in 2003
(Messervy-Whiting 2005). [[Besides]{.mark} these [formal channels of
cooperation, informal exchanges play a crucial role,]{.mark} especially
in cases of organisational incompatibility or other institutional and
legal barriers]{.underline}. [[This is particularly relevant for EU-NATO
relations]{.mark} because of the so-called participation problem and the
issue of limited sharing of classified information and
intelligence]{.underline} despite the signing of the 2003 Security of
Information Agreement (Lachmann 2010, Smith 2011, Græger 2017).

An interorganisational relationship emerges only under certain
circumstances. In the regime complexity and organisation theory
literatures, scholars have developed and compiled key components. These
allow to identify and study EU-NATO cooperation as an
interorganisational relationship and highlight the specifics of their
relationship. For example, both Merrett and Aldrich (cited in Dijkstra
2017) identify four key dimensions of interorganisational interactions
-- formalisation, intensity, symmetry and standardisation -- which have
also been picked up by Gehring and Oberthür (2004, 2009). In addition to
the levels of institutionalisation, the frequency and intensity of
interactions, and the power relations (symmetry) among organisations,
Gehring and Oberthür, emphasise the relevance of functional overlap and
membership overlap. In this context, Young (1999) distinguishes between
functional interplay and political interplay. Functional interplay
occurs when at least two organisations deal with the same issue or
problem and when these organisations are geophysically or
socioeconomically linked. Political interplay implies an intentional
interplay, i.e. created on purpose by the concerned organisations to set
up links in pursuit of specific goals, which can either be collective or
individua[l.]{.underline}

Regime complexity, network analysis and interorganisational relations,
interestingly, cannot grasp the full scope of member states in the
interactions between two organisations. Although they possess the
explanatory power to depict the relevance of secretariats, member states
still play a minor role. Due to their focus on the bureaucracies and
secretariats, these approaches express little about how states can
impact the evolution of interorganisational relations. As reality has
shown, several member states have essentially affected EU-NATO
relations, particularly France, Cyprus and Turkey, which needs to be
accounted for in theorising interorganisational cooperation. After all,
states are the key building blocks of organisations, possess the main
decision-making power in security issues and make essential
contributions of financial resources and capabilities (Abbott and Snidal
1998, Koch 2008). Member states have thus a decisive impact also on
interorganisational cooperation because they can steer the direction of
the organisation's external relations, its partnerships and general
orientation. Against this backdrop, member states shape
interorganisational relations under certain conditions: They need to be
the main decision-makers, particularly in cases of unanimity rule, and
provide key resources for maintaining cooperation[.]{.underline}

[While the [interactions between the EU and NATO are rooted in the
**security and defence**]{.mark} realm [and are based on several formal
agreements]{.mark} and declarations such as the 2003 and 2016 Joint
Declarations and the Security of Information Agreement, [they]{.mark}
also [maintain]{.mark} [liaison offices and]{.mark} **[frequently
exchange information]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet, [[what has
become most prominent]{.mark} in their relationship [are]{.mark} the
[overlaps]{.mark}]{.underline} in their functions and membership.
Functional overlap indicates the overlap of policy areas and mandates
that are covered by the IOs (Gehring and Oberthür 2009, Hofmann 2019).
It is expected that [[more]{.mark} links and opportunities [for]{.mark}
[dialogue and exchanges exist with]{.mark} more functional
[overlaps]{.mark}]{.underline}. This dimension also includes
geographical scope, i.e. the geographical area covered by an
international organisation regarding both membership and activity.
[[Membership]{.mark} [overlap]{.mark} is another defining component,
which refers to the number of states that are members in more than one
international security organisations]{.underline}. Here it is assumed
that a [higher level of membership overlap [facilitates]{.mark}
interactions and generally affects cooperation]{.underline}, either
positively or negatively. [Membership overlap is particularly defining
for [EU-NATO cooperation]{.mark} since twenty-one NATO states are also
member of the EU, which means that issues discussed at NATO's North
Atlantic Council (NAC) are transferable to the EU's Political and
Security Committee]{.underline} (PSC) and vice versa. Although the high
degree of membership overlap makes EU-NATO cooperation a specific case
of interorganisational relations, the issue of membership has also
provided much room for tensions and obstacles (cf. Koops 2017b).

#### EU separation from NATO is impossible -- interest in close [cooperation]{.underline} and lack of independent [capabilities]{.underline}

NATO has strong and deterrent military capabilities, and no one is in
doubt that when there is political will and solidarity among its
members, the Alliance is able to respond any threat coming from an
external source[. ]{.underline}

On the other hand, the EU is still in a soul-searching process in terms
of its military role in the current European security architecture;
still seeking to achieve strategic autonomy from NATO, it has been
caught unprepared for the US President Trump's approach to NATO and
European security[. ]{.underline}

Despite the progress achieved in the past decades, the [[EU]{.mark}
integration process in the field of [security and defence has not moved
ahead]{.mark} as fast as progress in other areas]{.underline}. The
[[reasons behind this are]{.mark} diverse]{.underline}, and include the
[[UK's reluctance to invest in]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark} efforts [as it
considered]{.mark} the [NATO the primary organization]{.mark} in charge
of European security]{.underline}, the USA's unclear position towards
European integration in the area of security and defence, [[and
differences of opinion among]{.mark} the [major EU
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} on how to deal with the RF.137

In transatlantic relations, ensuring [close co-operation and synergy
between NATO and the EU in areas of common concern is
important]{.underline}. These two key institutions have a common
objective, namely ensuring peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic
area. [Through regular meetings and contacts, they work together and
co-ordinate closely to ensure that their activities are complementary
and mutually reinforcing]{.underline}. NATO appreciates the EU's
increased efforts to enhance its defence capabilities through new
initiatives like EDF and PESCO, which will also contribute to the
strength of NATO; [the [EU]{.mark}, on the other hand, [values
NATO]{.mark}'s ongoing efforts, undertaken in a spirit of alliance and
collective security]{.underline}, to ensure the defence of the
Euro-Atlantic area, including through its fight against terrorism. In
this sense, the two organizations are aware of each other's important
roles and contributions to the maintenance of security and stability in
their respective areas of responsibility.138

In the opinion of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the
[[cooperation between NATO and the EU on military issues has **never
been closer**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the NATO Defence Ministers
meeting held in Brussels at the end of July 2018, Secretary General
Stoltenberg mentioned that [[in]{.mark} 74 areas, which range from
**[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline} to joint naval operations and
the fight against terrorism, [the [EU and NATO have been working
together and making significant progress]{.mark}]{.underline}.139

In the context of the EU's military projects, which are aimed at
enhancing the EU's defence capabilities and supplementing NATO assets,
the EU Commission proposed to invest 6.5 billion Euro over the next
decade in Europe's highways so that armed vehicles could be transported
easily around the continent. The priority given to military
infrastructure results from lessons drawn from deployment of military
vehicles from across Europe to the Baltics in 2018[.]{.underline}140

[[As they face common threats]{.mark} and challenges, pursue similar
strategic objectives through close co-ordination and co-operation, [NATO
and the EU have achieved]{.mark} a significant level of
[complementarity]{.mark} in planning and developing their defence
capabilities]{.underline}. It is thus fair to conclude that [the
[relationship]{.mark} between the two organizations is
[characterized]{.mark} more [by **synergy**]{.mark}]{.underline} than by
rivalry

#### Any future EU-led military operations will inevitably involve [NATO jurisdiction]{.underline}

[Although the EU's Helsinki communiqué stresses the need to avoid
"unnecessary duplication" of the EU's defense organization with that of
NATO]{.underline}, it is clear that [some [duplication of
capabilities]{.mark} and infrastructure [is inevitable]{.mark} and,
probably, even beneficial]{.underline}. It should not be overlooked that
most of WEU already duplicates, in one way or another, NATO structures.
The EU has, therefore, accepted that some duplication of effort and
organization is foreseeable. [If Europe's new defense ambitions were to
provide Europeans with more military capabilities (]{.underline}i.e.,
more strategic transport and intelligence capabilities[), thereby
duplicating what the United States already has available, this would be
the type of replication all NATO allies could happily live
with.]{.underline}

NATO's Fading Centrality. Another issue which will have to be thrashed
out is the future relationship between the "New EU" and NATO. [[Non-EU
NATO members have made it clear]{.mark} that [they want to be involved
in]{.mark} the decision shaping process on [European
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States has tried to formalize
the EU-NATO relationship on these issues, but France has blocked these
efforts and claims that the Europeans first have to clarify their
military ambitions among themselves. Paris also argues that, for the
time being, WEU should be the institution of choice for debating defense
issues with other European countries, as well as with Turkey and the
United States. [The [EU]{.mark} has, however, decided to embark upon
[strengthening ties between]{.mark} the [European Parliament]{.mark} (to
include its working groups and committees) [and NATO]{.mark}'s North
Atlantic Assembly.]{.underline}

Another part of this debate is the vital question of whether NATO has to
be consulted first, before any independent European military action will
be undertaken. In the lead up to the Helsinki summit, [[Washington made
it clear that before the EU decides]{.mark} to act on its own in a
crisis situation - with or without the use of NATO assets - [NATO should
be given]{.mark} a first option, or a [right]{.mark} of first refusal,
[to intervene]{.mark}]{.underline}. This problem of the order in which
decisions are to be made, in short "sequencing," is important, because
at NATO's Washington summit in April 1999 it was agreed that the EU
would have a "presumed access" to Alliance assets should U.S. troops not
become involved in a specific military operation. [American officials
also made it clear that "\[e\]ven if Washington decides not to send
troops, we still want to be involved in the decision-making process from
the beginning]{.underline}.\"15

Two goals are at odds - EU autonomy vs. letting non - EU states
influence decisions[.]{.underline}

In this respect, the Helsinki declaration is a cause for some concern
for the United States, as it continues to stress the need for EU
autonomy over the involvement of non-EU states in decision making.
Although it argues that "NATO remains the foundation of the collective
defense of its members and will continue to have an important role in
crisis management," this does not imply that NATO will endure as
Europe's pivotal security organization. In the future, Europe may well
be capable of taking autonomous military action without recourse to NATO
and even without first asking the United States to become involved. This
is the scenario which Washington fears may provoke a transatlantic
decoupling and, thus, spell the end of NATO as we know it - i.e., a NATO
based on American supremacy. Although this would not necessarily be a
serious disadvantage to Washington, in that a self-reliant EU would take
some of the military weight off America's shoulders, the long-term
implications could be huge. The EU's combined economic, political, and
military influence would transform Europe into a serious rival to the
United States on the world stage. EU foreign policy objectives would
overlap, but would certainly not be identical to those of the United
States. Europeans, for example, remain less fixated on China and on
issues of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). They are
more concerned with legitimizing their policies by international law and
a UN Security Council mandate and less hostile to "rogue states" like
Iran and Cuba. This implies that a stronger EU would not always have to
be in full agreement with the United States on many important global
political issues[.]{.underline}

Plans for a new Euro-force remain modest and accomplish little more than
enabling the EU to take military action without the United
States[.]{.underline}

For the time being, however, [the [likelihood of autonomous, EU-led
military operations is remote]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
path-breaking, the [Helsinki summit plans for a new Euro-force remain
modest and would accomplish little more than to enable the EU to take
military action if the United States does not want to be
involved]{.underline}. [For many years to come [any European-led
military operation will remain highly]{.mark} **[dependent upon
NATO]{.mark}** command structures as well as on U.S. intelligence and
logistics, if not more]{.underline}. [It is, therefore, [difficult to
foresee how]{.mark} the [EU would mount any]{.mark} serious
[operation]{.mark} [without]{.mark} at least the **[consent of]{.mark}**
the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. But, it is the
continuing uncertainty and vagueness of the operational details of the
EU's military structure and its future missions that cause concern
across the Atlantic. [In an effort to assuage American concerns, the EU
has proposed to offer key NATO military representatives permanent
seats]{.underline}, or observer status, in the EU's PSC and MC. Another
EU proposal offers NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(DSACEUR) to participate, "as appropriate," in the EU's MC. In any case,
of the 15 EU Member States, 11 plan to send the same representatives to
the EU and NATO military committees, which should ensure both
transparency and relatively smooth cooperation.

However, the higher mathematics of consultation mechanisms do not inform
us what the "New EU" actually plans to do with its fresh military power.
This remains unclear. For the time being, Europe's CESDP is bound to
have limited, regional ambitions. The EU debate focuses on Petersberg
missions and not on territorial or collective defense and, therefore,
does not touch upon Article V of WEU's founding treaty (which offers a
mutual assistance guarantee). [[Europe's military]{.mark} strategic
[planning will]{.mark}, therefore, focus on regional concerns and will
[not]{.mark}, at least not yet, [adopt a global
scope]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, whereas London has coined the
phrase that the EU will operate "in and around Europe," Mr. Solana is
already talking about an EU which might want to act in Africa as well as
in East Timor,16 and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has argued that
"\[t\]he Europe of the future must be able to defend its interests and
values effectively worldwide."17 The European Commission's Strategic
Objectives report of February 2000 also argues that the EU should aim at
a "Europe which can show genuine leadership on the world stage."18

However, although retaining a regional focus might acquiesce to American
demands, it also complicates an already grim transatlantic debate on
NATO's role in preventing the proliferation of WMD. In addition to the
U.S. Senate's rejection of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty,
the Clinton administration also wants to tinker with the existing
Anti--Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, proposing that the United States
set up its own national missile shield. Many European states worry that
this will not only set off another global arms race, but may also
decouple the strategic interests within the Alliance, when the United
States becomes less vulnerable to missile attacks. In any case, this
global/regional dichotomy is bound to increase transatlantic tensions
and to exacerbate U.S. concern over Europe's defense
ambitions[.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Strategic Autonomy Fails

#### Strategic autonomy fails due to "strategic cacophony" and capacity shortfalls -- best study

Its Security If the United States Pulls Back", Spring 2021,
International Security 45(4), p. 7-43 /lg

[[Determining whether Europeans could achieve strategic
autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline} anytime soon if the United States were to
pull back from Europe [[requires]{.mark} an [examination of]{.mark} the
[historical trajectory and]{.mark} the current and likely
[future]{.mark} state of European interests and defense capacity.
Although existing studies have analyzed important elements of each, a
more systematic analysis is needed]{.underline}.11 Regarding interests,
[[this article provides the **most comprehensive** and thorough
coding]{.mark} of national threat perceptions across all of Europe,
showing where each country falls across a set of deªned categories of
threat prioritization]{.underline}. Concerning defense capacity, it adds
to existing understandings of Europe's deªciency by providing novel
longitudinal data on European conventional defense capabilities over the
past three decades and by outlining a series of [four interwoven
challenges that would greatly complicate the pursuit of strategic
autonomy.]{.underline}

Our [analysis shows that [European efforts to achieve strategic autonomy
will be hampered by]{.mark} two major constraints: [profound defense
capacity shortfalls that will be hard to close, and "**strategic
cacophony,**" that is, profound]{.mark}, continent-wide
[divergences]{.mark} across all the domains of national defense
policies, most notably threat perceptions.]{.underline}12 These mutually
reinforcing constraints impose a rigid limit on the capacity of
Europeans to achieve strategic autonomy anytime soon. Consequently[, [if
the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [were to fully
withdraw, the continent would become signiªcantly more vulnerable to
Russian]{.mark} meddling and [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [[if]{.mark} the U.S.-backed [NATO]{.mark} were to
[disappear]{.mark}, [this would undermine the]{.mark} [only
institutional framework that has fostered]{.mark} some degree of
[coordination]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline} (at the strategic,
doctrinal, and capability levels) and partly contained Europe's
strategic cacophony. [This, in turn, would make institutionalized,
intra-European defense cooperation appreciably harder.]{.underline}

Ultimately, we conclude that [the [notion that Europeans would be able
to achieve defense autonomy]{.mark} following a U.S. pullback [is
**illusory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 And [[if]{.mark} even the major
shock of a [complete]{.mark} U.S. [pullback]{.mark} would be very
[unlikely to move Europe away from]{.mark} its current strategic
cacophony and capability [shortfalls]{.mark}, a [partial]{.mark} U.S[.
pullback]{.mark}]{.underline}---a much more likely
counterfactual---[[would be more unlikely to do so]{.underline}.]{.mark}
The policy implication is straightforward: [[if]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [wants European stability, it
needs to stay in Europe.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Moving away from [interoperability]{.underline} with NATO is impractical -- too many [European divisions]{.underline} on whether autonomy is desirable

Moritz **Pieper &** Martijn **Lak 19**, visiting Research Fellow at the
German Institute for International and Security Affairs and Lecturer in
International Relations at the University of Salford, UK & lecturer at
Hague University of Applies Sciences and the Erasmus School of History,

Security and Defence Policies and the 'Strategic Autonomy' Debate from a
Historical and Contemporary Perspective", 2019, Studies in European
Affairs 23(4), p. 23-44 /lg

In addition, [the level of **[logistical entanglement]{.mark}** serves
to [illustrate why a separation of EU defence]{.mark} [structures from
NATO]{.mark} structures [would be a
**near-impossibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}: NATO Prague Capabilities
Commitments resemble the Helsinki Headline Goal, [NATO's 'smart defence'
resembles the aim of "pooling and sharing]{.underline}" (Ghent
Framework). Autonomy from the US is thus being made all the more diffi
cult by an institutional copying that duplicates capacities in function
and purpose.55 Ronja Kempin and Barbara Kunz thus argue that "\[i\]t
thus makes little sense for U.S.-skeptic Europeanists to pit themselves
against Atlanticists as if we were back in de Gaulle's 1960s or the
post-Cold War 1990s".56

The notifi cation of November 2017 to formally launch [PESCO recognizes
as much. The [Council states]{.mark}: "Enhanced [defence capabilities of
EU]{.mark} Member States [will also benefit NATO. They will]{.mark}
strengthen the European pillar within the Alliance and [respond
to]{.mark} repeated [demands for]{.mark} stronger [transatlantic burden
sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 1), [[and]{.mark} writes of the need
to [ensure "**interoperability with NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 5).
The mechanism of Permanent Structured Cooperation, introduced by the
Lisbon Treaty but never implemented, was launched on 23 June 2017. The
ambition behind the realization of PESCO is to allow EU member states to
work more closely together in the area of security and defence issues by
providing "an ambitious, binding and inclusive European legal framework
for investments in the security and defence of the EU's territory and
its citizens", as the notifi cation reads.57 On a broader conceptual
level, the Commission has also launched its own White Paper on the
future of Europe.58 Member states willing to cooperate more on defence
matters would be able to do so under the third scenario put forward in
the Commission White Paper ("those who want more do more"). As the
Commission puts this vision of a multi-speed Europe in security affairs:
"This includes a strong common research and industrial base, joint
procurement, more integrated capabilities and enhanced military
readiness for joint missions abroad".59 Interestingly, scenario 4
("doing less more effi ciently") talks of a "European defence Union"
that would be able to speak with one voice on all foreign policy
issues.60

The EU Council's decision to upgrade the Military Planning and Conduct
Capability (MPCC) to 60 permanent staff in order to run Battlegroup-size
executive military CSDP missions by the end of 2020 is an important step
in this direction of 'strategic autonomy' (EEAS, 2018).61 The NATO
Defence Planning Process (NDPP) would also need to defi ne what
capabilities are required of European contributors, if Europeans want to
contribute to Article 5 operations, non-Article 5 operations without the
US and other non-EU Allies (Norway, Turkey, Canada), and to be in a
position to conduct autonomous expeditionary operations. But to do that,
the EU will have to commence a genuine strategic debate that would serve
as a framework to channel its resurfaced defence ambitions in order to
credibly embed CSDP within a wider understanding of what 'strategic
autonomy' should entail across multiple policy domains. The 2016 EU
Global Strategy takes up the term of 'strategic autonomy' and develops
European policy responses to the multiple challenges that the EU is
confronted with (EU Council 2016).62 The EU "will take responsibility
foremost in Europe and its surrounding regions", as the EUGS
states[.]{.underline}

The "strategic partners" in far-away places like Brazil, China, or
India, by contrast, no longer play a discernible role. After its
publication, additional policy papers were released that were indicative
of an accelerated move towards greater defence cooperation, such as the
European Security Compact (a joint Franco-German paper, Ayrault and
Steinmeier, 2016), the Bratislava Road Map issued by the European
Council on 16th September 2016, the EP's vote on the European defence
Union on 30th November 2016, the Commission's European defence Action
Plan, and its 2017 Refl ection paper on the future of European defence.
Even the Commission, "traditionally reluctant to name the 'D' word",63
was supportive, and has put forward the idea of a European Defence Fund
(EDF) in June 2017. With this fund, €5.5 billion could be spent per year
'to boost Europe's defence capabilities' in support of the
implementation of the EU Global Strategy, as the Commission announcement
reads.64 [The [momentum for new defence policies]{.mark}, however, is
[complicated by corporate and political factors]{.mark}. Defence
companies follow their own industrial logic, no matter how hard
political leadership tries to push things in a certain
direction]{.underline}.65 [[Mutual reservations]{.mark} within the
Eurofighter consortium [illustrate the diffi culty of creating truly
European]{.mark} (i.e. transnational) [defence]{.mark}
contractors]{.underline}.66

Moreover, while the rhetoric of the US president has generated a renewed
drive towards advancing "[[strategic autonomy]{.mark}",]{.underline} the
latter [is [unlikely to move beyond]{.mark} its [buzzword]{.mark} use
for as long as the [EU remains an institutional vessel for]{.mark} its
member [states to agree to disagree]{.mark} on what to use it for in
security and defence matters]{.underline}. For example, it irritated the
Baltic states and frustrated the French that a truly operational PESCO
-- beyond the PR merits of its declaration -- was of secondary
importance to the Germans,67 and Eastern European member states tend to
place greater confi dence in bilateral US security guarantees than
others. [A realistic reformulation of a European security identity is
therefore likely to be based on enhanced cooperation between groups of
countries that want to do more (as the 2017 Commission White Paper puts
it), not on an EU-wide consolidated effort]{.underline}. The
introduction of Qualifi ed Majority Voting (QMV) in the Foreign Affairs
Council would be a further step in that direction, but is unlikely to
materialise in a Union of 27, as attempts to circumvent consensus
requirements in foreign policy questions continue to be perceived as
sovereignty losses. [This makes swift changes to transatlantic defence
arrangements less likely.]{.underline}

Conclusions

Tracing the evolution of EU security and defence policies, this article
has illustrated how [[European defence]{.mark} developments [have often
been reactive to American positions]{.mark} and
perceptions]{.underline}. [[European security]{.mark} was [**conditional
on**]{.mark} the [**transatlantic** element]{.mark}, but also
[complicated by]{.mark} the nature of intergovernmentalism in security
affairs, national [divergences]{.mark} in security cultures,
[and]{.mark} an **[absence of]{.mark}** an [EU-wide **consensus** as to
what]{.mark} level of [ambition]{.mark} in this domain [is
desirable]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two key issues of West German
rearmament and the role of the US in nascent European defence ambitions
dominated the discussion in the late 1940s and early 1950s and have
served to forge a transatlantic community as an "Empire by Invitation":
as [Europe invited the US in]{.underline}, it stymied security
divergences between European member states. The failure of the Pleven
plan and the EDC were indicative of the diffi culty of bridging the
divide between Atlanticists and those member states in favour of more
European security and defence autonomy.

The second part of the paper showed how similar dividing lines quickly
resurfaced after the end of the Cold War, when the debate surrounding
the European Security and Defence Identity alluded to renewed ambitions
to develop a distinct European voice in security affairs. We have argued
that [European consent to considerable US involvement in defence affairs
has hampered the development of such autonomy as much as intra-European
divergences on this policy domain have]{.underline}. The EU--US
relationship has undergone cyclical disruptions during, but more so
after the end of the Cold War, yet the election of a new US president in
2016 has called its underpinning logic into question more forcefully
than ever at a level of offi cial policy discourse.

As an external trigger factor, Donald Trump's election and his scathing
critique of NATO and Europe's budgetary contributions to its defence
expenditures has therefore elevated the EU's CSDP ambitions to a new
level. With a rather astonishing pace, strategy papers have been
published, the Commission put forward the idea of a European Defence
Fund (EDF) in June 2017, and "Permanent Structured Cooperation" (PESCO),
a mechanism for closer defence cooperation already foreseen in the
Lisbon Treaty, was fi nally launched and activated in November 2017 (EU
Council 2017) -- even though the [piecemeal streamlining of the
operational, industrial, and political components of "strategic
autonomy" leaves much to be desired]{.underline}.68

Finally, the state of CSDP and the public debate surrounding it needs to
be put into a broader global context beyond transatlantic relations: The
necessity for an overhaul of Europe's global strategy was underlined
against the background of the 2015 migration crisis, terrorist attacks
in Europe and the inadequacy of European intelligence-sharing they
exposed. A genuine strategic voice is not only needed in light of the
often-discussed foreign policy re-orientations of actors like Russia and
China, but also in light of the EU's own passive response to crises in
its own neighbourhood. It was this general state of alert that is refl
ected in a German military study entitled "Strategic Perspective 2040",
which outlines different scenarios for the development of the
international order. In the worst-case scenario, the study holds, "EU
enlargement has been largely abandoned, other states have left the
community, Europe has lost its global competitiveness".69 The launch of
PESCO in 2017 will not be the panacea for Europe's search for a solution
to the twin challenges of uncertainties in transatlantic relations and
crises in the European neighbourhood and the Eurasian theatre, but can
only be one element amongst many. 'Strategic autonomy' goes beyond CSDP.
Yet, the brief historical overview of US-EU interaction on questions of
institutional innovation presented in this paper has demonstrated that
the transatlantic defence cooperation has been a crucial factor in
enabling a margin of permissiveness for any European 'strategic
autonomy' to develop[.]{.underline}

#### Brexit and Trump thump -- [empirics]{.underline} prove that aff cards are written by unreliable [Europe enthusiasts]{.underline}

Luis **Simon 17**, research Professor at the Institute for European
Studies (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Director of the Brussels office
of the Royal Elcano Institute with a PhD in International Relations from

HYPE ABOUT EUROPEAN DEFENSE", 06/27/2017, War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2017/06/dont-believe-the-hype-about-european-defense/

[If you're a Europe-based think tanker, policy wonk, or commentator,
Donald Trump and Brexit are **great for business.**]{.underline} Just
about every Brussels pundit is leading off his musings about Europe's
future with some sort of Trump or Brexit hook. If you haven't heard by
now that either Trump, Brexit, or --- ideally --- both offer historical
windows of opportunity for European defense cooperation, you're way
outside of the Brussels bubble.

[Those invested in the notion that the European Union can become
strategically autonomous interpret pretty much whatever happens out
there as a catalyst for greater European defense cooperation. Every time
there is some sort of global crisis or "external shock,"
catalyst-related narratives pop up]{.underline} --- there are just too
many politicians, officials, and pundits in Europe who lust after such
narratives.

[**We have been here before**. Many times]{.underline}. Think about the
[Balkan Wars]{.underline} triggering all that talk about the hour of
Europe; of the [Russian invasion of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008 [and
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 being widely viewed as wake up calls for
Europe; or how [Obama's 2010 announcement of a pivot to
Asia]{.underline} or reluctance to lead on Libya supposedly left
Europeans no choice but to take security matters into their own hands.
And let us not forget the 2003 [Iraq War]{.underline}, when millions of
Europeans took to the streets to protest against George W. Bush and Tony
Blair's mischiefs. That irresponsible, trigger-happy, and condescending
American cowboy --- not to speak of his British "poodle" --- was
supposed to be the mother of all catalysts for greater European defense
cooperation.

And yet, [**no serious push** for European strategic autonomy ever came
about. E.U. defense die-hards have been left at the altar again and
again]{.underline}. What they typically acknowledge, by way of
consolation, is that these things take time and patience --- [Rome was
not built in a day]{.underline}. They also argue important steps are
being taken, and these things (i.e. the articulation of a serious E.U.
defense policy) tend to move forward one step at a time. Yet, it is not
easy to keep count on how many allegedly "important steps" have been
taken along the long and winding road to European strategic autonomy.
But perhaps the next catalyst will be the real thing that many seem to
be waiting for. Enter Trump and Brexit.

[Some say Trump is just too unstable and untrustworthy to look after
European interests]{.underline} or be entrusted with the defense of the
international liberal order. Others argue his emphasis on greater allied
burden-sharing means Europeans need to step up their defense efforts. No
matter which of these arguments you prefer, the conclusion is similar:
Europeans have no option but to get their act together[.]{.underline}

Yet, [the notion that an irresponsible or disengaged America forces
Europeans to take care of their own security could re-open old divisions
on fundamental questions]{.underline}. One such question is nuclear
deterrence. This is a question many could pretend to ignore during the
two decades that followed the end of the Cold War, as the so-called
peace dividend gave way to repeated European attempts to integrate
Russia into the West. However, [Russia's annexation of Crimea has put
deterrence and defense back in Europe's security agenda]{.underline}.
And Moscow resorting to nuclear saber-rattling as a means of
intimidation, and its ongoing efforts to modernize its nuclear arsenal,
underscore the renewed importance of nuclear weapons for European
security. Any serious discussion on European strategic autonomy must
square the nuclear circle.

This leads to a critical and highly uncomfortable question[: Given
widespread reluctance around the idea of a German nuclear deterrent, are
Paris and Berlin ready to reach some sort of sharing agreement over the
French nuclear deterrent? Most unlikely]{.underline}. The idea of
national strategic autonomy is embedded in France's political DNA, and
an independent nuclear deterrent is the jewel of France's autonomy
crown. [Germany]{.underline}, for its part, might have come to terms
with its de facto strategic subordination to the United States through
NATO. But it [is unlikely to sign off on a serious European defense
scheme if its role is to be relegated to playing second fiddle to
France]{.underline}, let alone Britain. This red line was already set by
former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt during the Cold War. For
Brandt, [any European defense scheme independent from NATO would require
a serious discussion about the modalities for including]{.underline}
West [Germany]{.underline} in the process of decision-making concerning
the French nuclear deterrent: Germany's role could not be "restricted to
infantry tasks." This continues to reflect German thinking.

[As long as a shared nuclear deterrent is off limits]{.underline},
Berlin is unlikely to reject any sort of French (or British) nuclear
umbrella, both for strategic and political reasons. Therefore, and for
all the rhetoric about Trump having done more for European defense
cooperation than anyone else, once the electoral fog clears in Germany,
[we should expect key European leaders to re-emphasize the centrality of
the United States to Europe's security and geopolitical
architecture]{.underline}, and put their energies on co-opting the
United States (mainly through NATO) and re-stating its commitment to
European security.

Now [let's turn to Brexit and the myth that "British recalcitrance" has
been responsible for the misfortunes of "European defense]{.underline}"
over the last few decades. With the British out of the E.U. --- or so
the argument goes --- the path is finally clear for European strategic
autonomy. Never mind the [**sorry state** of European military
capabilities, or that Britain has actually been one of the leading
advocates of greater military spending in Europe, and of investing in
modern capabilities]{.underline}, having partnered with France to that
effect. [Never mind that, when it comes to defense, the French are just
as likely to hold Germany's hand and release Britain's as Trump is to
get a standing ovation in the European Parliament]{.underline}. And
never mind the gulf between France and Germany, the supposed engine of
an alleged European security enterprise.

France looks at military force not just through the lens of defense and
deterrence, but also as a means of advancing its foreign policy and
economic interests. And it makes a proactive use of it. Germany rejects
that vision. It sees the military as a last resort defensive instrument.
These are [deeply ingrained differences of strategic
culture]{.underline}. And any serious effort on the part of Germany to
overcome its cautious and defensive attitude towards military power is
likely to cause discomfort amongst some of its European partners, France
included. In many ways, when it comes to defense spending and its
attitude towards the use of force, [Germany is damned if it does and
damned if it doesn't.]{.underline}

At any rate, the [differences in French and German attitudes toward
military force are not just philosophical. They project into virtually
any debate on European security cooperation]{.underline}, whether it
relates to capability development, new institutional structures, or
launching E.U. military missions.

The never-ending debate over the establishment of an operational
headquarters for the planning and conduct of E.U. military operations
give us an example that is both critical to any debate about European
strategic autonomy and highly illustrative of the extent to which
Franco-German differences can cripple the idea of a serious E.U. defense
policy. The French have traditionally pushed for a fully staffed
European Union military headquarters geared for planning and conducting
expeditionary missions. The Germans have advocated for a more modest
civilian-military planning facility focusing on low-intensity,
peacekeeping, and stabilization missions. [Despite numerous
institutional reshuffles in the European Union's planning and conduct
structures, French and German **red lines have barely moved** since the
CSDP was launched]{.underline} in 1999.

As a result, it has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly significant steps
for the European Union to establish a "Military Planning and Conduct
Capability" composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting with the
planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e. training and
assistance) missions. By way of comparison, it took NATO barely a few
years to set up a permanent, integrated military command structure with
a strategic level command and several joint force and specific component
commands capable of planning and conducting all types of
operations[.]{.underline}

All in all, ongoing differences amongst the European Union's key member
states suggest that [neither Brexit nor Trump are likely to prove to be
real game changers for E.U. defense cooperation, let alone lead to
European strategic autonomy]{.underline}.

Ever since NATO's Brussels summit of 1994, the United States has, at
least rhetorically, supported the development of a European Security and
Defense Identity (ESDI) and expressed its readiness to make Alliance
assets and capabilities available for WEU operations. Although American
media were somewhat dumbfounded by what was generally seen as an overly
ambitious European attempt to go it alone and establish a European
military union (akin to the other EMU), U.S. officials have aired their
agreement with Europe's military push. At first, however, Washington was
concerned with the message of the EU's Cologne summit of June 1999,
where the Europeans proposed to give the EU a defense character without
committing themselves concretely to a commensurate increase in Europe's
military capabilities. In this respect, the subsequent Helsinki summit
was reassuring to the United States, because it embedded the CESDP
within the Atlantic security framework and followed through with
concrete military headline goals[.]{.underline}

In December 1999, following the Helsinki summit, U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott argued that "\[t\]here should be no confusion
about America's position on the need for a stronger Europe. We are not
against; we are not ambivalent; we are not anxious; we are for it. We
want to see a Europe that can act effectively through the Alliance or,
if NATO is not engaged, on its own. Period, end of debate."7 But, of
course, the transatlantic debate over the reorganization of European
security and defense has just started in earnest, with many a serious
quarrel and argument lying ahead. One of the main questions will be why,
or perhaps even whether, the United States has given up its resistance
to the organization of European defense within the EU. (Of course,
answering this question depends to a large extent on the outcome of the
U.S. presidential elections of November 2000. An Al Gore administration
may be more supportive of Europe's new defense ambitions than a George
W. Bush administration[.]{.underline})

One classical American argument against an EU--based security system is
that this would provide a backdoor security guarantee to EU members,
both present and future, who are not covered by NATO's Article 5.
Because [[EU Member States]{.mark} like Finland and Austria, [who are
not members of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, will participate fully in the
EU's CESDP, they will [[indirectly affect]{.mark} the European input
into [NATO and may in crisis]{.mark} situations [**call upon the**
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates for military
assistance]{.underline}. Other crucial questions remain outstanding: Are
policy makers in Washington no longer concerned about the possible
emergence of an "EU caucus" within NATO which may present the United
States with inflexible European policy positions and faits accomplis? Is
America now ready to give up its influence over European security and
hand over its position of benign hegemonic leadership to the EU?

The Kosovo experience taught Europeans some embarrassing lessons and
convinced many in the United States that crises in the EU\'s backyard
should be solved by the Europeans themselves[.]{.underline}

Clearly, the British change of heart on European defense urges the
United States to rethink its attitude toward the EU's budding defense
ambitions. Now that Washington has "lost" its staunchest ally with an
undiluted Atlanticist security orientation, the United States feels that
the vitality of the Alliance may well be renewed by supporting the
CESDP. What is more, the Kosovo experience not only offered Europeans
some embarrassing lessons, but it convinced many in the United States
that crises in the EU's backyard should preferably be solved by the
Europeans themselves. However, the timing and the vague modalities of
Europe's defense adolescence still trigger ample American Angst.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's famous "three D"s illustrate
these concerns. Washington does not want: a decoupling of Europe's
security from that of America's; a duplication of effort and
capabilities; or discrimination against those allies outside the EU.
Although Lord Robertson formulated a looser, and less negative, "three
I"s (i.e., the indivisibility of the transatlantic link; the improvement
of European capabilities; and the inclusiveness of all allies in
Europe's defense policy), working out the difficult practicalities of
the CESDP is bound to become a source of strain in U.S - EU
relations[.]{.underline}

America's Ambiguous Enthusiasm. Apart from good intentions on both sides
of the Atlantic, little is clear in the emerging new balance of power
between the EU and NATO and, hence, between "Europe" and the United
States. Whereas WEU has always been an unequal partner of NATO in the
defense field, the EU is bound to play a much more assertive and
forceful role in shaping Europe's institutional security landscape.
Unlike NATO, the "New EU" will not only have a sturdy military
capability at its disposal, but also a broad arsenal of economic,
financial, and political instruments of statecraft. Given that most of
Europe's regional problems and conflicts may not be truly resolved by
military means - at least not in the long run - the EU is bound to
become the actor of choice to address European security
challenges[.]{.underline}

To all but a few Atlanticist purists, it is obvious that the strategic
balance within NATO is in need of urgent change. Although the Kosovo
experience has exposed this unhealthy imbalance within the Atlantic
Alliance, the lack of frankness in the debate remains worrisome.8
Europeans and Americans alike know that NATO and the transatlantic
relationship have to be recast and that this will be a painful and
problematic exercise. It seems fair to say that if the EU is serious
about its intent to establish a common European defense policy, the
ultimate objective is to lessen Europe's military dependency on America.
Meanwhile, the EU now wants to have the possibility of fighting a
Kosovo--like war without the consent and military support of the United
States. This is, one would assume, nothing to be ashamed of and should
be considered a normal ambition for an economic and political
superpower-in-the-making like the EU. However, underneath the varnish of
the Clinton administration's cautious support lingers the concern that a
more self-reliant Europe will undermine the old NATO tradition of U.S.
hegemony and, therefore, risk a transatlantic decoupling. Both Europeans
and Americans also fear that an increasingly isolationist and
unilateralist U.S. Congress might react to a stronger European defense
by arguing that it is now time to leave European security to the EU and
bring home American troops.9 On the other hand, it is understood that
the U.S. Congress may well be more likely to continue its support for
NATO if the Europeans are serious defense partners. Based on the EU's
new defense moves, EU Member States have decided that [the [risk that a
new]{.mark} [European military force might undermine NATO is less
significant]{.mark} than the threat posed by the status
quo]{.underline}. Given these political imponderables, much attention is
being paid to the managing and packaging of a rebalanced EU-U.S./NATO
relationship.

There are three questions that remain unresolved that are bound to cause
transatlantic problems over the next few years. The first is how closely
should the EU's CESDP duplicate NATO's existing capabilities and
institutional structures? The second concerns how to "sequence" the
decision making processes in case of wars or crises and in the real
military challenges the EU is likely to face in the decade ahead. The
third involves the impact of the new strategic balance within the
Alliance on Europe's defense industrial base - and vice
versa[.]{.underline}

The Duplication Dilemma. French Defense Minister Alain Richard argued
that "\[w\]hat fear of duplication really conceals is worry \[in the
United States\] about the appearance of a new political partner, the
European Union."10 Although the Helsinki decisions look impressive on
paper, it is clear that the [[EU's military]{.mark} infrastructure will
remain rather modest and [nowhere]{.mark} [near the size of]{.mark} the
[NATO military]{.mark} staff]{.underline}. A European military
secretariat, reporting to Solana, will decide how many military planners
the EU needs in its defense organization. The EU's defense organization
will, in any case, draw heavily on planning done in the EU's Member
States. The EU's plans certainly do not involve, or imply, setting up
standing European armed forces with a permanent multinational command,
at least not for the near future. But, it will be difficult to foresee a
serious CESDP that does not acquire better defense technology, better
trained and deployable troops, as well as at least some parallel
military structure.

[NATO\'s [European members]{.mark} had two million soldiers, yet [had
difficulty providing 40,000 troops for Kosovo.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is on this point that Europe's harsh political reality could start to
overtake the strategy laid out at Helsinki, because it seems evident
that [[EU]{.mark} Member States at present [do not]{.mark} wish to
[allocate sufficient money to buy]{.mark} first-class, home-grown
[defense systems]{.mark} - ranging from intelligence gathering
equipment, precision - guided weapons, and electronic warfare
capabilities, to search and rescue forces]{.underline}. Although
[[Europe]{.mark} [spends 60 per cent of]{.mark} what the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates does [on defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Kosovo war
exposed Europe's weaknesses. Despite having two million people in
uniform, [NATO's European members were hardly able to place 40,000
troops in position in time to fight a regional war]{.underline}. Most
[[European troops]{.mark} are still [designed]{.mark} [to repel a Soviet
ground attack, rather than]{.mark} to [rapidly deploy troops to nearby
crisis situations]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Because there is hardly
any public support to increase defense spending, much is being made of
trying to spend money more wisely and operating more efficiently by
cooperating more closely on the European level. Lord Robertson argued
perceptively that "\[i\]f you've got a budget that is 60 per cent of the
American budget and is probably turning out 10 per cent of the
capability then that is your first big problem . . . You can actually
spend more money quite easily and get zero increase in capability."11

But, [is it really realistic to assume that Europe is spending enough on
defense and all it needs to do is create more synergy and achieve more
efficient defense cooperation?]{.underline} Money may be better spent to
get "more bang for the Euro," but, as John Chipman has argued: "[[Unless
defense expenditure]{.mark} is allowed **[substantially]{.mark} to
[increase]{.mark}**, the [build-up of]{.mark} a serious
\[[European]{.mark}\] [defense]{.mark} capacity [will remain]{.mark} the
**[stuff of communiqués]{.mark}**]{.underline}."12 According to NATO
figures, the United States spends about 3.2 per cent of its GDP on
defense (down from 6 per cent during the Cold War), with France and the
United Kingdom spending 2.8 and 2.6 per cent, respectively; Germany
(1.5) and Spain (1.4) find themselves at the low end of the spectrum. On
average, [defense spending by NATO's European members has dropped by 22
per cent since 1992]{.underline}. It is of no surprise, therefore, that
the United States is calling upon its European allies to take on a
bigger share of the defense burden within NATO. In December 1999, U.S.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen criticized Germany for spending too
little on defense, arguing that this has a "profound and lasting impact
on the capabilities, not only of \[Germany\], but of the alliance as a
whole."13

It is in this context that EU Member States may well decide to set
spending targets for buying new satellite - based navigation and
guidance systems, fighter airplanes and transport aircraft, and the
other defense equipment needed to make European forces deployable within
the 60-day target. In the run up to Helsinki, several proposals were
aired, ranging from clear - cut defense convergence criteria (by
François Heisbourg), which would include a 2 per cent minimum of GDP for
defense and a 30-40 per cent minimum of the defense budget for
procurement and R&D, to suggestions for a so-called European System of
Force Elements (by Tim Garden and John Roper) for financing, military
planning, and command arrangements.14 However, for those countries that
still have to reach the Maastricht government debt criteria (which
include Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain), it will
be problematic to spend significantly more on defense without breaching
EMU commitments. Politically, [it will also be difficult to assure that
no EU Member State drags its feet]{.underline} on defense spending in
order to take a free ride on Europe's CESDP. A Europe based on political
solidarity cannot accept the silent NATO rule "who pays, plays."
However, even if the Europeans were willing to spend more on defense and
set up defense benchmarks, the political momentum of the EU's CESDP
implies that they will "buy European." This will receive a very cool
reception in Washington and is likely to increase tensions within the
Alliance.

### 2AC -- No Solvency -- Ukraine

#### EU can't solve---Ukraine thumps

Judy **Dempsey 2022**, Dempsey is a nonresident senior fellow at
Carnegie Europe and editor in chief of Strategic Europe, February 2022,
"What Ukraine Reveals About NATO and the EU",
<https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/86325> //skwon

They don't like to admit it. [But there is an **unnecessary rivalry**
between **NATO** and the **E**uropean **U**nion.]{.underline} NATO is a
military, defensive organization. The EU is an economic and political
one with vast resources to make a difference to its own members and to
its neighbors. [Both organizations can complement each other, with
**NATO focusing on military operations** and the **EU on civilian
missions**. **They don't.**]{.underline}

The crises in Europe's eastern neighborhood, the latest being Russia's
military intimidation of Ukraine to the extent where [**Moscow** is
threatening its sovereignty and independence, are **testing NATO and the
EU**. The outcome will affect **Europe's ability** to act
**strategically** and further **integrate**. The omens **don't look
good** for either.]{.underline}

[NATO has had its fair share of differences among its European
members.]{.underline} Recall how the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003
almost destroyed NATO. Then, France and Germany lined up with Russia to
oppose the attack. Moscow nearly succeeded in achieving its long-term
goal of splitting the transatlantic alliance. NATO's military
intervention in Libya in 2011 and its recent withdrawal from Afghanistan
left the alliance bruised and demoralized.

[But since Russia began threatening to invade Ukraine again, NATO has
shown some spunk. It is sending troops to the Baltic states and
Romania.]{.underline} Even though Ukraine or Georgia are not going to
join the alliance any day soon, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
refuses to cede to Russia's demand to rule out accession.

NATO's metal would be really tested if the alliance offered Ukraine the
Membership Action Plan (MAP). That would set the country on a trajectory
toward NATO but also lead to an unpredictable reaction by Russia.
Remember how NATO opened the door to Montenegro that was nowhere near
fit to join the alliance and was threatened by Russia if it did. Nothing
happened.

[That aside, on **Ukraine NATO** is **holding the line**. This is
despite Germany's attempts to stop some of its members from sending
weapons to Kiev. More telling, and this is the **big difference**
between NATO and the EU, most of the alliance's **Western and Eastern
European members** are now beginning to share a **common threat
perception.**]{.underline}

**[That is not the case in the EU.]{.underline}**

[When it comes to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, apart from the near absence
of any leadership from the European Commission, the European External
Action Service, and [the **European Council**, the bloc is rife with
**divisions**.]{.underline}

[It's not only that the member states have struggled to agree on
additional sanctions on Russia. The two most important countries,
**France and Germany**, don't seem to take the views of the Baltic
states and the Central Europeans seriously, unlike NATO]{.underline}.
It's as if Central Europe and the Baltics have upset the comfort zone
that characterized the EU before that big bang enlargement of 2004. [The
crisis in Ukraine has accentuated these differences.]{.underline}

The Central Europeans and the Baltic states can take some of the blame.
Leaving aside the degradation of the rule of law in Poland and Hungary,
the region's influence inside the union would have benefited from
forging alliances with the older member states.

Poland did that with Sweden when center-right party Civic Platform was
in power in Warsaw in 2007--15. It led to the EU establishing a new
policy for its Eastern neighborhood. Since 2015, when Law and Justice
came to power, Poland hasn't made full use of its size, geography, and
history to shape an EU policy toward Ukraine and Russia.

[This is the **greatest weakness** of the **EU**: its **lack of any
strategic policy** toward its **eastern neighbors** on the one hand and
toward **Russia** on the other. The crisis unfolding in Ukraine confirms
these intellectual, political, and strategic deficits.]{.underline}

It would make a big difference if Germany took the lead in moving the EU
out of this trough. That seems unlikely. [The government in **Berlin is
divided** over how to deal with **Russia**.]{.underline} A wing in
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party is wedded to an
Ostpolitik. The supporters of this Cold War policy believe strengthening
political, trade, and economic ties with Moscow would bring Russia
closer to the West. Instead, it has made Germany's political elites and
economic lobbies more dependent on Russia.

This dependency, exemplified by the controversial Nord Stream 2
pipeline, has deepened the suspicions among the EU's Nordic, Baltic, and
Central Europeans about Germany's ambivalence toward Russia and how its
position toward Ukraine is seen through the prism of Russia. Indeed,
[because of these views, it's **hard to see** the **EU** becoming more
**politically integrated**.]{.underline} Distrust of Berlin runs deep.

France's position too has rattled some EU governments. French President
Emmanuel Macron's calls for a Europe to build up its own strategic and
defense capabilities are not about making the bloc independent of NATO
or the United States. They are about preparing Europe to deal with the
changing geopolitical landscape and power shifts, dominated by China and
Russia. [Their **policies** can **undermine Western democracies** and
the **stability of the EU** if the Europeans do not recognize the nature
of the threats posed **by Beijing and Moscow.** Ukraine should be
forcing a major rethink in European capitals]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- No Solvency

#### Independence from NATO decks case solvency -- intra-European conflicts would prevent interoperability and joint capability development

Hugo **Meijer &** Stephen G. **Brooks 21**, CNRS Research Fellow at
Sciences Po, Center for International Studies, and the director of the
European Initiative for Security Studies & professor of government at
Dartmouth College, "Illusions of Autonomy: Why Europe Cannot Provide for
Its Security If the United States Pulls Back", Spring 2021,
International Security 45(4), p. 7-43 /lg

An additional [challenge is institutional. [Europe's strategic cacophony
has prevented Europeans from]{.mark} [developing an autonomous]{.mark},
military-planning, command and control (C2)
[structure]{.mark}]{.underline}.110 Indeed, a report by the European
Parliamentary Research Service explains that one of the greatest
challenges of European defense is "[the lack of integration of the
military structures of the Member States]{.underline}."111 Although an
effective and autonomous European defense would require the creation of
a permanent planning and C2 infrastructure, [the [question of]{.mark}
developing an [autonomous]{.mark} Operational [Headquarters]{.mark}
(OHQ) [has proven **highly divisive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.112 [An OHQ
was never established [because of conºicting national interests and
priorities]{.mark} among Europeans]{.underline}, in particular France,
Germany and the UK. [Whereas Paris has long supported the establishment
of a military OHQ to bolster the EU's strategic and operational planning
structures and its contingency planning and C2 capacity, London has
strongly resisted, seeing it as a duplication of NATO's
assets]{.underline}. Germany has stood somewhat in between, though
closer to the UK, favoring a focus on civilian-military planning and C2,
not least to avoid duplicating structures already existing at NATO.113
[As a result, the [EU remains entirely **dependent on NATO**]{.mark} or
national assets [for]{.mark} the planning and conduct of [major
executive operations]{.mark}, for which [it has no autonomous military
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}.114

If the United States were to pull back from Europe, it remains to be
seen whether the Europeans could rely on a "Europeanized" NATO, in which
the integrated structures would stay in place but without the United
States.115 [Military planning and C2 require a clear chain of command.
When NATO was created, Europeans agreed to be under U.S. military
command, rather than attempting the far more difªcult task of agreeing
to be under the command of another European country or group of European
states]{.underline}. More generally, as the hegemonic power in NATO, the
United States has facilitated institutionalized cooperation among
Europeans and helped partly contain Europe's strategic cacophony.116
[[For decades, a U.S.-led NATO has been the overarching shaper
of]{.mark} national defense policies and military transformation in
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, helping overcome coordination and
collective-action problems.117 [In light of Europe's deep-seated
strategic divisions, a [U.S. disengagement would]{.mark}
[amplify]{.mark} these [coordination and collective action
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} (assuming NATO survived) [[and would
further hinder institutionalized]{.mark}, intra-[European defense
cooperation at all levels:]{.mark} [strategies and doctrines; training;
operational learning; **interoperability**; and **joint capability
development**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Likewise, without the United
States, the persistent and profound divergence of threat perceptions and
strategic priorities among Europeans is likely to impede their capacity
to agree on shared C2 structures for conducting operations, except for
the lowest end of the spectrum of conºict (e.g., peace support
operations).118

As a result of strategic cacophony, the EU has, in fact, struggled
mightily to create even the most minimal C2 structure. As Luis Simón
underscores, "It has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly signiªcant steps
for the European Union to establish a 'Military Planning and Conduct
Capability' composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting with the
planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e., training and
assistance) missions," with an advisory role only.119 Ultimately, [given
Europe's deep-seated divergences, there is [no basis for optimism that
Europeans will be able to agree]{.mark} being under the permanent
command of another European country for deterrence and defense or to
consistently undertake effective institutionalized military cooperation
[without the enabling role played by]{.mark} the United States within
[NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### **2AC -- Squo Solves Autonomy**

#### Strategic autonomy is [inevitable]{.underline} but would be blocked by a lack of [financial resources]{.underline} absent NATO involvement -- [Brexit]{.underline} threw everyone for a loop

Hidayet **Çilkoparan 18**, Master of Science in the Department of
International Relations at the Graduate School of Social Sciences of the
Middle East Technical University, "EUROPE'S SECURITY CHALLENGES AND
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS", October 2018, Middle East Technical

Since the very beginning of the European integration process after WWII,
integration in the field of security and defence has not always been
high on the agenda. Similarly, the progress achieved in the new century
has remained limited. Mainly due to the closer linkage of these areas to
national security and sovereignty, and perhaps even more importantly
because of NATO's presence, considerable integration under the EU roof
in these areas has not been considered possible or likely[. Since the
end of the Cold War]{.underline}, especially from the 2000s onward,
however, [the [EU has been gradually deepening]{.mark} its integration
in [security and defence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Security challenges like
conflicts in the Balkans and other countries in the EU's immediate
neighbourhood, terrorism and irregular migration, as well as other new
threats and challenges like [**[cyber-security]{.mark}** that have
demonstrated that no country can counter and eliminate these threats
alone have [given]{.mark} [momentum]{.mark} to the EU's further
integration]{.underline} in these areas. The rising strength of the RF
in international politics, demonstrated by its aggressive interventions
in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond under the leadership of
President Putin has been another major factor. The [recent [rhetoric
of]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} leadership about [disengagement]{.mark} from
European security and NATO also appears to have [encouraged the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline} its efforts to quickly enhance its defence
capabilities and accordingly new initiatives were undertaken.145

Academicians, thinkers, analysts, observers, politicians, so on, who
have been observing the development of EU security and defence policy
and trying to understand why [Europe felt the need to develop its own
defence capabilities]{.underline}, while a robust collective security
organization like NATO existed. [Some explained this need through the IR
theory of structural realism]{.underline}. They argued that "instead of
balance of power, balance of threat" need to be focussed on[. Even
though the EU did not perceive an immediate threat from the USA, its
decades-long hegemony in Europe, sustained through NATO, has started
becoming disturbing and Europeans decided to take steps to balance the
US]{.underline}, so that they could enjoy a balanced partnership in
transatlantic relations and affect US decisions on actions it may take
with regard to international security and stability.146 

In this respect, the concepts of "balancing" and "bandwagoning" have
also been referred to in explaining European instincts as to when to
side with or counterbalance the USA. When there was a most serious
threat to all like the Soviet Union and expansion of communism,
[Europeans clustered around the USA (bandwagoning) and felt safer. Once
the major threat disappeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the end of the Cold War, the [European states]{.mark} began
[moving]{.mark} in a different direction [to balance the
**US**]{.mark}A]{.underline}, so that they can maintain a healthier and
balanced relationship with this global hegemon.147

In fact, the USA's attitude regarding the ESDP (CSDP) has remained
unclear, because US decision-makers have been hesitant about how far the
ESDP / CSDP should be developed and what level of duplication with NATO
capabilities would not be considered "unnecessary duplication." Indeed,
the USA has been facing a dilemma since the end of the 1940s: it has
been pushing European countries/the EU to become a stronger partner by
enhancing their military capabilities, while it has been concerned about
the possibility that a well-developed CSDP could duplicate NATO and
weaken transatlantic ties. Issuance of the Saint Malo Declaration by
France and the UK in December 1998 has only deepened the US concerns.
Although the EU, at its Helsinki Summit in December 1999, reassured the
USA by confirming that it would act and undertake operations only if and
when \"NATO as a whole is not engaged\", even this confirmation could
not fully eliminate [US worries about potential rivalry of the EU to the
NATO over time]{.underline}. [The debate held among France, Germany,
Belgium and Luxembourg on setting up "a separate EU operational planning
headquarters]{.underline} in Tervuren/Belgium" provoked further concern
in Washington. [This initiative has been blocked by the UK]{.underline}
and a potential source of further disagreement in transatlantic ties has
been eliminated, at least [until Brexit]{.underline}. Whether the
separation of the UK from the EU may lead EU members to revisit this
idea remains to be seen. On the other hand, as noted also under previous
Chapter, [[acquisition of]{.mark} more reliable European [defence
capabilities by the EU enjoys **strong support** among]{.mark} the
[European public and governments]{.mark}]{.underline}. The EU's efforts
are likely going to be watched closely by not only the USA, but also
other NATO allies that are not EU members, like Turkey and Norway. As
the EU continues to develop its military and autonomous planning
capabilities, it will be inevitable to have closer co-ordination between
the EU, the USA and non-NATO European allies (and Canada), as three
major components of the European security architecture. Within this
framework, NATO would seem to be a potential forum for co-ordinating the
interests and initiatives of these actors.148

Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009 and
the [Libya crisis in 2011, which once again exposed the EU's
inefficiency as an institution in the face of such a major crisis, the
EU, on the one hand, has been trying to streamline its internal
decision-making processes regarding security and defence]{.underline}
and come up with a common vision of strategic interests, as prescribed
in the 2016 EUGS. Even in the existence of improved procedures and
conceptual framework, it remains unclear whether the EU and its major
powers will be able to act decisively and effectively in the face of a
new crisis. After the international intervention in Libya, the conflicts
in Ukraine and Syria have also shown that the EU is slow and relatively
inefficient if the USA does not contribute and even lead. The US
announcement of a foreign policy adjustment shifting its focus to
East/South Asia has to some extent worried the EU and encouraged it to
take some new steps, but it appears that it will take many years for the
EU to become a major power, which would be taken seriously by the RF in
terms of military strength. Especially, if and when the RF is involved
in a major crisis, the EU immediately turns to the USA for its
involvement and leadership. In this regard, the development of the CSDP
and strategic autonomy may not affect the nature of transatlantic
relations, as far as major conflicts involving the RF are concerned.149

[[Brexit]{.mark} has the potential to [expose]{.mark} the [EU's military
weaknesses and inability]{.mark} to act]{.underline} to respond to major
crises in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond. [Its [ambition to
achieve strategic autonomy is going to be undermined]{.mark} as
well.]{.underline} At minimum, it will take time, increased efforts and
more funds to achieve it, because [Brexit is going to take away up to a
quarter of the EU's defence capabilities.]{.underline} France may assume
an increased role in this regard, however, it does not have the
necessary financial resources and looks to Germany to provide
much-needed funds to foster EU integration in the field of defence.
Germany prefers to carry out projects aiming to enhance defence
capabilities under the EU structural framework.150

Accordingly, the implementation of the CSDP, after Brexit, would be a
lesser concern to the USA, as it will take time for the EU to achieve
strategic autonomy and develop a balanced interaction as an equal
partner in transatlantic relations. Given President Trump's strong
emphasis on the military might of the USA, the EU faces difficult times
and stands at a crossroads whether to take tough decisions on whether to
follow US political leadership as their strategic interests and
approaches in international relations continue to gradually diverge. In
this regard, if the CSDP turns out to be a success story by implementing
its various projects and initiatives, the EU has the potential to become
an increasingly disobedient ally of the USA pursuing its own interests.
In fact, it is already possible to observe such differentiation in the
approaches of the USA and the EU, by looking at their policies towards
North Korea and Iran.151

At this point, in addition to what has already been considered above, it
may be useful to take a closer look into the possible impact of Brexit
on transatlantic relations[.]{.underline}

5[.]{.underline}4. Brexit's Potential Impact on Transatlantic Defence
Co-operation 

Under the previous chapter and section, I examined the possible impacts
of Brexit on the security and defence projects and co-operation carried
out under the EU's CSDP. In this section, applying a strategic approach,
I will try to analyse Brexit's possible implications on transatlantic
defence co-operation, including relations between the EU and
NATO[. ]{.underline}

The current major challenges to security in Europe underline the fact
that geographical neighbours are interdependent on each other for
ensuring their security from all kinds of threats and challenges[. Even
though the [UK]{.mark} is leaving the EU, it is [not going to move away
from the EU]{.mark}. European security analysts find it important that
the two sides are conscious of this reality and carry out Brexit
negotiations accordingly, [so]{.mark} that [they do not weaken
European]{.mark} and Euro-Atlantic defence
[arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}.152

Security analysts consider the implications of Brexit on European
security very important. It is mainly because, [for the EU, the [Brexit
will result in the loss of]{.mark} one of its two [major military
power]{.mark}s]{.underline}.153 On the other hand, [there is
**[NATO]{.mark}** to **[cushion]{.mark}** the likely [impacts of
Brexit]{.mark} on European security. ]{.underline}

In fact, thanks to its advanced military capabilities, including nuclear
weapons, the [UK has been a major contributor to European security and
defence, which has increased the EU's weight and credibility in world
politics]{.underline}. Some predict that that [[as a result of
Brexit]{.mark}, the [EU's power will be reduced by]{.mark} up to [25
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any rate, [[it is a **significant
loss**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Therefore, in case Brexit negotiations are
not conducted in a spirit of mutual compromise and in a tidy manner, it
may reflect negatively on the strength and security of both sides. The
[[EU can be expected to move ahead with]{.mark} its old [plan]{.mark} to
set up a European operational headquarters, [which]{.mark} [has]{.mark}
thus far [been obstructed by the UK]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has
viewed NATO as the primary military security organization in Europe.154 

Furthermore, the UK, thanks to its special relations with the USA, has
been a leading voice within the EU for the interests of Eastern European
countries, so called New Europe. These countries have been looking to
the UK for guidance on many issues. [In the absence of the UK, the EU
will be a significantly different environment for them]{.underline}. The
UK has also functioned within the EU as a counterweight to Germany and
France, which traditionally favour closer and deeper integration in all
possible areas, and its departure therefore worries some Eastern
European countries, as they won their independence not long ago after
the collapse of the Soviet Union. One can argue that in the post-Brexit
period, the UK may still be able to intervene in EU defence projects and
initiatives through these countries.155 

[With the UK's departure from the EU, even though it will remain a NATO
member and thereby committed to European security, France will be the
only nuclear and significant conventional military power in the
EU]{.underline}. In this regard, [[France has already started asking
Germany to increase its financial contributions]{.mark} to the
enhancement of Europe's defence capabilities]{.underline}. New EU
initiatives like EDF and PESCO got underway, however, it is not year
clear how the USA will react to these new steps. In case Germany
provides additional financial contributions to European projects but
refrains from making a noticeable contribution within the NATO
framework, it is possible that it could elicit further reaction from the
USA. As long as the USA remains as a member, the issue of avoiding
duplication, on which the USA is sensitive, has the potential to cause
further EU-USA frictions, as the latter expects EU members to purchase
major defence products from US companies.156 

Under the current European security architecture, NATO and the EU, even
though they co-ordinate to some extent, undertake their own planning in
the areas of defence, capability enhancement and operations. The
[[separation of]{.mark} a major player like the [UK]{.mark} from the
EU]{.underline} may bear consequences on the modalities of cooperation
between these two organizations. It might strengthen the relative
position of NATO within those modalities. On the other hand, as
discussed extensively above, it [might also [permit deeper integration
among remaining EU member states that could]{.mark} in turn [allow the
EU to become]{.mark} a more [credible]{.mark} interlocutor in the
NATO-EU relationship]{.underline}. Therefore, as a final point under
this section, it appears important to note the fact that the [Brexit
will further expand the "power asymmetry" between NATO and the
EU.]{.underline} A [[**most feasible solution** for the EU may
be]{.mark} to keep pursuing "[strategic autonomy]{.mark}" from
NATO]{.underline}, by including the UK to the extent possible, through
creative arrangements under EUGS / CSDP.157

### 2AC -- Nuclear Deterrence

#### EU is strengthening its deterrence capacity now

Agnes **Szucs 2022,** She is an EU reporter at Anadolu Agency, and
previously worked as a Media and Communication Manager at the European
Parliament, January 2022, "EU must develop deterrence capacity: Bloc\'s

//skwon

The EU must expand "a lot" its deterrence capacity as it was not able to
prevent the war, [the **EU foreign policy chief**]{.underline} said on
Tuesday, referring to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. "Our deterrence
has not been strong enough to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's
aggression," [Josep Borrell]{.underline} told EU lawmakers at the
European Parliament's plenary session dedicated to the Russian-Ukrainian
war. He [stressed that the EU must strengthen its **"deterrence capacity
a lot"** to be able to prevent wars. He argued that the Russia-Ukraine
war shed a light on the fact that the common EU defense is **"no longer
a luxury, it is a necessity**," stressing that the bloc needs
"instruments for coercion, retaliation, and counter-attacks." This will
be "the **birth certificate** of a **geopolitical Europe**," Borrell
stressed, referring to the bloc's new defense strategy, the so-called
**Strategic Compass** that will be adopted next week. At the same time,
he asserted that the **EU has already demonstrated** its ability to act
as a **"hard power"** by imposing **strong sanctions** on Russia.
**Borrell's Strategic Compass** sets concrete proposals and timelines
for strengthening the **EU defense**, such as setting up a swiftly
deployable **EU force** of 5,000 troops, **investing** in **industrial
capabilities**, and **securing** the bloc **against
cyberattacks**.]{.underline} The plan would strengthen the bloc's
defense in a complementary way to NATO requirements. EU lawmakers will
vote later on Tuesday for a resolution condemning Russia\'s war on
Ukraine.

Latest developments Since Russia\'s war on Ukraine began last Thursday,
it has been met by outrage from the international community, with the
EU, UK, and US implementing a range of economic sanctions on Russia.
[The EU adopted last week three sanctions packages against Russia,
targeting among others, President Putin, top diplomat Sergey Lavrov, the
Russian banking sector, and key state-owned companies.]{.underline} On
Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy officially signed his
country\'s request to join the EU. In an open letter, Lithuania, Latvia,
Estonia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Romania
expressed support for Ukraine\'s swift candidacy. So far, at least 136
civilians, including 13 children, have been killed and 400 others,
including 26 children, injured in Ukraine, according to UN figures.
Around 660,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, the UN
refugee agency said on Tuesday.

#### The EU [can't]{.underline} solve nuclear deterrence -- even France's nuclear sharing [won't]{.underline} work

Most recently, in February 2020, President [[Macron proposed]{.mark} to
deepen Europe\'s Joint Strategic Culture through the [sharing]{.mark} of
[French nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on the idea of
increasing opportunities for other EU member states to access the French
nuclear strategy through participation in nuclear-operation-related
exercises and other activities, thereby creating an overall picture of
Europe\'s nuclear deterrence\[19\]. [However, within the EU, [the legal
decision to **maintain the**]{.mark} **current [NPT]{.mark}
regime**]{.underline} [[and the **historically deep-rooted
anti-nuclear** public opinion]{.underline} [became
entangled]{.underline}]{.mark} [in a complex manner, and [the EU]{.mark}
handled the issue cautiously, [assuming]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[discussions on nuclear]{.mark} forces [could **undermine political
unity.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

In view of the circumstances surrounding the EU, [[the best
solution]{.mark} for responding to the nuclear threat]{.underline} that
Europe faces [[is not to use]{.mark} the [European nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} approach **proposed [by
France]{.mark},**]{.underline} but to [develop a cooperative nuclear
posture]{.underline} through loosely-based cooperation, [within a scope
that does not violate the sovereignty of the nuclear
countries]{.underline}(U.S., U.K. and France), [as a part of the
[strengthen]{.mark}ing of [the current **EU-NATO
relationship**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} This means a [political process
in which]{.underline} the items related to [[nuclear deterrence will be
added]{.mark} to EU-NATO cooperation]{.underline}, and consultations and
[coordination on specific nuclear cooperation are started at a
working-level.]{.underline} Albeit in the form of [[NATO\'s]{.mark}
provision of [**extended nuclear deterrence** to the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline}, this is a realistic response that [the EU,
with]{.underline} its [complicated nuclear issues]{.underline}, can
tolerate in terms of strategic autonomy.

In other words, [it is **[difficult for the E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion**]{.underline} [[to achieve strategic autonomy
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the core part of its [[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy, and **[[the solution
is]{.mark} cooperation with [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Needless to
say, [NATO is an alliance centered on the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, which contradicts the direction of Europe\'s
strategic autonomy. However, I think that [realistic decisions made by
the EU]{.underline}, without being swept away by ideals, [should be
appreciated]{.underline} from a broader perspective.

#### [Despite]{.underline} growing insecurity, the EU [won't]{.underline} embrace nuclear deterrence -- there's [scattered]{.underline} views

The 29 July edition of Germany's Welt am Sonntag hit newsstands like a
bombshell. The weapon in question was painted in German national
colours, and illustrated the front-page headline **["Do we need the
bomb?"]{.underline}** Inside, the writer argued that: ["For the first
time since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany is no longer under the
US nuclear umbrella."\[1\]]{.underline}

It is extraordinary that this question should arise so prominently in
peace-loving, anti-nuclear Germany. But it is not before time. This
year, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[Council]{.underline}]{.mark}
on Foreign Relations [[conducted a **comprehensive survey**]{.mark} of
attitudes towards nuclear issues across the]{.underline} member states
of the [European Union]{.underline}. Two overarching themes emerged.
Firstly, **[[despite the growing insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** all
around them, [[Europeans remain **unwilling** to face]{.mark} up to the
**renewed relevance** that [nuclear deterrence]{.mark} ought to have in
their strategic thinking]{.underline}. Secondly, and [as a
consequence]{.underline}, [[national attitudes remain]{.mark} much where
they were when the subject dropped off the agenda at the end of the cold
war]{.underline} -- which is to say, **[[scattered across the]{.mark}
entire [spectrum]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from those who continue to see
nuclear deterrence as an essential underpinning of European security [to
**enduring advocates** of]{.mark} unilateral nuclear
[disarmament.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is hardly the only important challenge on which [Europeans' views
are all over the place]{.underline}, and about which [they would prefer
to remain in denial]{.underline}. As one official told the authors,
["Europe has not only outsourced its security, but also its security
thinking".]{.underline} But when set against the dramatic changes
occurring in the international security environment, the results of this
research demonstrate that there is now an urgent need for Europeans to
think about, and debate, nuclear deterrence anew[. [A 'German bomb' is
**unlikely to prove attractive**]{.mark} -- not least to Germans
themselves]{.underline}. Europeans must instead give serious
consideration to whether a Franco-British 'nuclear umbrella' would be a
possible and desirable complement to, or substitute for, the current US
nuclear guarantee to Europe. This paper concludes that this issue is
significant but belongs to a range of nuclear weapons-related topics
with which Europeans need to re-engage.

Regardless of whether it proves viable to agree to a "nuclear
Saint-Malo", to borrow a phrase coined by a member of ECFR's
pan-European research team, one thing is clear: the situation is such
that Europeans can no longer pretend that their declared ambition of
"strategic autonomy" is more than an empty phrase unless they engage
seriously on the nuclear dimension. [The absence of a European deterrent
may be a fatal flaw for such an ambition.]{.underline} Besides nuclear
capabilities, there are many ways in which Europe can move towards its
stated bid for strategic autonomy. But, without this, many Europeans
will continue to believe that Russia will always hold the whip hand in
any military confrontation with a Europe not backed by a credible US
nuclear guarantee. And yet [[most Europeans' approach]{.mark} to the
nuclear dimension of a rapidly shifting strategic environment [is to
keep their **eyes tight shut.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The EU will [never]{.underline} go nuclear -- each country wants to [reduce]{.underline} nuclear weapons and it [won't]{.underline} fly with the public

**Rapnouil '18** \[Manuel Lafont; 12/19/18; Senior policy fellow and
former head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign
Relations, headed the Political Affairs Division of the Department for
UN affairs at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Development; and Tara Varma, senior policy fellow and head of the Paris

smarx, AZG\]

[[European attitudes are **a patchwork of
opinions**]{.underline}]{.mark}: the United Kingdom and France are
nuclear powers in their own right, with public opinion more or less
solidly behind this status. The historical experience of Poland and the
Czech Republic leads these states to be more confidently supportive of
nuclear deterrence. Countries such as [[Denmark,]{.mark} the
[Netherlands, and Germany]{.mark} have [seen **civil society clash**
with]{.mark} their governments' decisions around hosting [nuclear
weapons. Ireland and Austria are **active campaigners** for]{.mark} the
**[abolition]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

Despite all this, [most [EU]{.mark} member states have two things in
common]{.underline} in this matter. First, nearly [all of them [share
a]{.mark}n official]{.underline}, if ostensible, **[[commitment to
reducing nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**: research for this paper
revealed that only three member states harbour reservations about the
goal of nuclear disarmament. This is all while many of these countries
remain within NATO, which is of course underpinned by the potential of
nuclear-backed intervention via Article 5. The potential tension between
this pro-disarmament stance and the enjoyment of the US nuclear umbrella
is something yet to fully play out.

Second, [[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [have **little salience in the
public**]{.mark} **imagination.**]{.underline} [On the
occasions]{.underline} in the late cold war period [when European
governments were obliged to make difficult decisions about nuclear
weapons, [these became]{.mark}]{.underline} fraught and
**[[contested]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the country at large as well as
in parliament]{.underline}. But [with the disappearance of the Soviet
threat, Western governments and populations became **less obliged** to
think]{.underline}, and argue, [about nuclear weapons]{.underline} with
the degree of heat and rigour that they had had to prior to 1989. In
[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, most [were more than [content to enjoy
the]{.mark} [happier]{.mark}]{.underline} and more [hopeful
[international environment]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and to simply
**dismiss nuclear worries** from their minds]{.underline}. Rather than
peace underpinned by nuclear weapons, as many cold war leaders
characterised it, Europeans began to enjoy peace with nuclear weapons
still around. Nuclear weapons disappeared from the public debate. The
end of the cold war led to an effort to reduce the total number of
nuclear warheads in the world, with Russia and the US doing
substantially more heavy lifting in this regard even if they still
possess considerably more weaponsthan France and the UK, which have both
moved significantly towards minimal deterrence.

If anything, [[the public]{.mark} today [is]{.mark} rather **[inclined
towards disarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- which may partly explain
its relative lack of concern as the total number of weapons in the world
fell, although it is hard to say that Russia and the US won many
plaudits for their efforts either[. If [a shift]{.mark} in public
attitudes does now come about, this [may emanate from **high-level
activism.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In the context of the TPNW, [[the
decision to award the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2017 [[Nobel]{.mark} Peace
Prize [to the]{.mark} International [Campaign to Abolish Nuclear]{.mark}
Weapons [hints at a **new wave of abolitionism.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[finds stronger expression in national
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}: last year's [[German]{.mark} federal
election saw the]{.underline} Social [Democrat]{.underline} challenger
for chancellor [promise the **removal** of US nuclear weapons from the
country. And, in the [UK]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a [unilateralist
disarmer is now leader of the Labour Party [and Scotland]{.mark}'s
ruling Scottish National Party is **firmly [opposed ]{.mark}**[to
nuclear]{.mark} weapons.]{.underline}
