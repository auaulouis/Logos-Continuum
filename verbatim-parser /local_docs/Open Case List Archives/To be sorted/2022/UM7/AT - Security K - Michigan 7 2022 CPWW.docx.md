The securitization framework has been a useful tool to analysts who want
to challenge the notion of the objectivity of security threats. The
framework is elegant and has generated much academic interest and
sparked the number of critiques and debates, aiming to broaden and
further specify the framework in order to increase its logical coherence
and explanatory power. However important and innovative contribution to
our understanding of security may it be, the [securitization framework
is problematically narrow]{.underline}. First, [the form of act
constructing security is defined narrowly, with the main focus on the
speech of dominant actors, usually political leaders, which **encourages
an interpretation that securitization is only happening when there are
discursive interventions of those who are institutionally legitimate to
speak on behalf of a particular political community**]{.underline}
(usually a state). [This also **excludes** a focus on other forms of
representations, such as **images or material practices**.]{.underline}
(McDonald, 2008: 564). Thus, [the focus is on the speech and its
performative power to construct security.]{.underline} At the same time,
the conceptual framework of [securitization puts a special emphasis on
the acceptance of the audience which is claimed to be essential in the
successful securitization process]{.underline}. Contextual factors,
which the Copenhagen school terms [facilitating conditions, help explain
why some securitizing moves are more likely to be accepted by the
audience than the other]{.underline}. These facilitating [conditions are
taken as givens that either help or hinder securitization but are not
conceptualized as constitutive of the speech acts]{.underline}, [which
is at odds with the claim that security is a social
construction.]{.underline} There is tension between understanding
securitization as a productive process by focusing on the performative
power of the speech act, and as a constructed process by claiming that
security is intersubjectively constituted. This tension gave rise to
critique by the so-called Second Generation of securitization analysts
who argue that securitization can not be properly understood outside
historical and cultural context in which security discourse takes place.
Thus, the very meaning of security is contextual. Finally, [the
framework of securitization is narrow in the sense that the nature of
the act is **defined solely in terms of the designation of threats to
security**]{.underline} (McDonald, 2008: 564). This claim is based on a
commitment to the idea that [security is constituted in oppositional
terms: by designating that which it is not or that from which it needs
preservation or protection]{.underline} (Waever, 1995: 56). Sometimes
[it is more effective if security is conceptualized in terms of
normative goals]{.underline} [that should be achieved or expression of
the core values that are in need of being protected]{.underline}, [than
if it is articulated only in terms of "from what and from whom it needs
protection"]{.underline}. Thus, [seeing security as something negative
per se does not represent a logical imperative anymore]{.underline}.

**Securitization's focus on dominant voices silences marginal
populations**

To date I have focused on the 'narrowness' of the securitization
framework in analytical terms, suggesting the possibility for
strengthening the framework by drawing out important elements of context
and different forms of representation, for example, while also pointing
to the limits and tensions within the framework that might make this
difficult. I have also suggested in these contexts that it is important
to avoid viewing the framework as shorthand for the broader construction
of security. [The question of which actors' representations are viewed
as significant within this framework, however, entails important
normative commitments and has important normative
implications.]{.underline} Put simply, the securitization framework
focuses on articulations capable of leading to change in practice, with
the [default position being a focus on the 'securitizations' of
political leaders who are able to achieve a wide audience in their
statements and interventions, and who are able to marshal the resources
of the state to respond]{.underline} European Journal of International
Relations 14(4) 574 [to the existential threat.]{.underline} As Wæver
(1995: 57) argues, '[security is articulated only from a specific place,
in an institutional voice, by elites'. Such a focus serves to
**marginalize the experiences and articulations of the powerless in
global politics**, presenting them at best as part of an audience that
can collectively consent to or contest securitizing moves, and at worst
as passive recipients of elite discourses.]{.underline} In perhaps the
clearest statement of this limitation, Lene Hansen (2000) has discussed
the ways in which the [**focus on speech acts means contributing to the
silencing of women**, whose suffering and engagement with security
discourses is neglected in a framework that focuses on the articulations
of the powerful: of those whose voices can be heard and of those whose
successful attempts at securitization can result in the enactment of
emergency measures]{.underline}. Such a framework clearly has little to
say about the plight of the most vulnerable in global politics and their
experiences of --- and engagement with --- security and threat. Indeed
for Hansen, the Copenhagen School [**does not simply neglect the
experiences of women but in fact serves to further marginalize them**.
'If security is a speech act', Hansen]{.underline} (2000: 306)
[suggests, 'then it is simultaneously deeply implicated in the
production of silence']{.underline}. In many ways this focus on dominant
voices in the construction of security is not a problem for the
Copenhagen School alone. [Traditional security proponents
and]{.underline} some [post-structuralists limit the number of actors
deemed important in security terms in focusing on either state policy or
dominant discourses.]{.underline} While Copenhagen School proponents
allow the possibility for security actors and 'securitizers' other that
state political leaders (Buzan et al., 1998: 31--3), this move is
ultimately closed off by the dual suggestions that [security is
ultimately about states]{.underline} (e.g. Wæver, 1989: 314; Wæver,
1995: 47--9) [and that security is articulated from a position of
institutional power]{.underline} (Wæver, 1995: 57; Buzan et al., 1998:
32--3). The default position here is therefore [a focus on the political
leaders of states and their designations of threat.]{.underline} The
methodological focus on speech acts might also be seen as relevant to
this bias. As Jennifer Milliken (1999: 243--5) has argued, the tendency
to ignore subjugated knowledge or voices is a general inclination within
discourse analytical approaches to international relations. In short,
[the focus only on dominant voices and their designation of security and
threat is normatively problematic, contributing to the silencing of
marginal voices and ignoring the ways in which such actors have
attempted precisely to contest these security
constructions.]{.underline} But it also has problematic implications
analytically. First, and echoing criticisms noted above, it [pays
insufficient attention to the means through which particular
articulations of security and threat become possible]{.underline}: how,
for example, are marginal actors and their articulations of security
silenced or marginalized? [Focusing on]{.underline} these [marginalized
or subjugated actors could point to some of the ways in]{.underline}
McDonald: Securitization and the Construction of Security 575 [which
'securitization' becomes possible, expanding the emphasis on
'contexts']{.underline} noted in the previous section. Second, it
arguably encourages the particular logic of security which the
Copenhagen School embraces. A range of (often marginal) actors contest
dominant logics or discourses of security and threat through
articulating alternative (even emancipatory) discourses of security and
threat rather than simply arguing for 'desecuritization'. Amnesty
International's campaign on human rights violations against Kurdish
populations in Turkey in the 1990s, for example, particularly questioned
the justification of these violations on the grounds of 'security'. This
was reflected in the title of its publication, Turkey: No Security
Without Human Rights. For such actors, security (defined in non-statist,
non-exclusionary and non-militaristic ways) can be a means for --- or
site of --- emancipatory change. For the so-called Welsh School of
critical security studies, focusing on the marginalized and 'voiceless'
(Wyn Jones, 1999: 159) points to the ways in which potentially
exclusionary, statist and militaristic security discourses can be
challenged and replaced without simply giving up on security as a
political category. Here, it could be argued that the choice within the
Copenhagen School to ultimately limit attention to powerful actors and
voices blinds its proponents to the role of security as a site of
competing discourses or images of politics, and even potentially as a
site for emancipation. Narrowness in this context has important
normative implications that those using the framework would do well to
reflect upon.

[Securitization theory similarly occludes the racial violence of normal
(liberal) politics]{.underline}. This is not just a conceptual problem:
it [results in major empirical oversights]{.underline}. For example[,
though it contains the word 'security', securitization theory places
social security outside of its frame of analysis, as part of 'normal
politics':]{.underline} 'Although it shares some qualities with "social
security," or security as applied to various civilian guard or police
functions, [international security has its own distinctive, more extreme
meaning. Unlike social security, which has strong links to matters of
entitlement and social justice, international security is more firmly
rooted in the traditions of power politics']{.underline} ([Buzan et al.,

- Not the speech act that matters but the reaction -- instead of
  critiquing the lang of the 1ac they should be analyzing reactions to
  it -

Related to the above focus on the role of linguistic practices, it is
also possible to argue that the securitization framework is
problematically narrow in McDonald: Securitization and the Construction
of Security 571 its focus on the speech act relative to the social and
political context in which the act itself occurs. Indeed, this is a
problem acknowledged (but not fundamentally redressed) in Buzan et al.
(1998).12 Put simply, in developing a universal framework for [the
designation or construction of threat through speech acts]{.underline}
the Copenhagen School ultimately [downplays the importance of contextual
factors --- such as dominant narratives of identity --- that condition
both patterns of securitization and the broader construction of
security.]{.underline} This is particularly curious given that Wæver has
explored these contexts in detail elsewhere, linking security
perspectives and actions to narratives of history and identity in
European contexts (Wæver, 1996; Hansen and Wæver, 2001). To the extent
that there is engagement with the context of the speech act in the
Copenhagen School, it has come in three central forms. The first is to
suggest that [we can see dynamics of securitization playing out in
different 'sectors'.]{.underline} For these theorists, [the designation
of threat looks different in the context of military concerns than
environmental ones]{.underline}, for example. Perhaps most prominent in
these distinctions is that between societal and state sectors (Wæver et
al., 1993), the former defined in terms of the preservation of preferred
identities and the latter in terms of the preservation of sovereignty
(usually defined as non-intervention). This draws an important
analytical distinction between often conflated referents of nation and
state. However, [the division between sectors does not go far enough in
recognizing context, focusing only on different dynamics of
securitization across different issue areas rather than on the processes
through which these security referents are themselves given
meaning.]{.underline} And as Roxanne Lynn Doty argues (1998/9), drawing
meaningful analytical distinctions between these sectors is sometimes
difficult and often unhelpful. [Political leaders can and do
simultaneously invoke sovereignty and identity as that in need of
preservation, and attempting to compartmentalize security dynamics can
obscure broader forms of discursive continuity in approaches to issues
as disparate as immigration, environmental change and traditional
military practices in particular historical or social
contexts.]{.underline}13 The [second form of engagement with contextual
factors concerns the role of so-called 'facilitating conditions',
referring to those dynamics, developments and institutional contexts
that enable 'securitizing moves' to become successful.]{.underline}
Here, Ole Wæver (2000: 252--3), echoing the discussion in Buzan et al.
(1998: 31--3), has identified the importance of the form of the speech
act; the role of the securitizing actor; and the 'conditions
historically associated with that threat'. The recognition of the latter
two of these conditions --- most prominently the third --- certainly
moves towards addressing the role of context. [The problem here is more
simply that this potentially important insight --- which takes us beyond
a set of strict criteria to be met in terms of the act of securitizing
--- is not incorporated within the securitization]{.underline} European
Journal of International Relations 14(4) 572 [framework
itself]{.underline}, [which **focuses overwhelmingly on the peformative
role of the speech act rather than the conditions in which
securitization itself becomes possible**]{.underline} (Buzan and Wæver,
2003: 72). It is not a coincidence that this dimension of the
securitization framework remains under-theorized: examining historical
'experiences' with threat designation calls for a looser and highly
interpretative approach to analysis which potentially conflicts with the
development of a neat and coherent set of 'requirements' to be met for
securitization. Finally, the securitization framework engages with
contextual factors in acknowledging the role of audiences and the
importance of security pronouncements being 'backed up'. This
recognition would seem to be central to the broader recognition of the
importance of context in the designation of security and threat, but
there are two limitations here. The first is that, quite simply, what
being 'backed up' means, how we know when it happens and what the
implications are when it does not are radically under-theorized in the
Copenhagen School. [While recognizing that security is
inter-subjectively constructed, the focus on the speech act as
performing security arguably paints security less as a site of
negotiation than one of articulation.]{.underline} Thierry Balzacq
(2005) has suggested that the role of audiences is underspecified
because of Wæver's reliance on Austin's theorization of language. Here,
the work is done by the articulation itself rather than the result of a
negotiation between the articulator and the audience at whom the
articulation is directed. More specifically, the power of the speech act
would appear to be undermined by the full incorporation of the idea that
the act itself is only one part of the securitizing process: that it
relies upon the acquiescence, consent or support of particular
constituencies. There are certainly opportunities here for
counter-readings on this point. While retaining an emphasis on the
productive nature of speech, Judith Butler (1997), for example, has
suggested that Austin's conception of the speech act implies the
possibility that they can be either 'perlocutionary' (necessary for
enabling particular actions) or 'illocutionary' (performing a function
at the moment of speech). [Allowing the possibility that speech acts are
perlocutionary potentially enables greater attention to audiences who
might either consent to particular actions suggested through speech or
engage in contesting the terms of the speech act or the actions
suggested in response to it]{.underline} (Butler, 1997: 15). An
alternative interpretation of the [speech act]{.underline} might be that
it [serves to construct or produce the audience itself]{.underline}.14
Further, it might be suggested that [the role audiences play is in
helping to constitute speech communities in which particular forms of
representation are intelligible and legitimate and others unintelligible
and illegitimate]{.underline} (e.g. Fierke, 1997). These are all
particular readings of the 'speech act' that at some level constitute
attempts to come to terms with the production--construction distinction,
McDonald: Securitization and the Construction of Security 573 what
Holger Stritzel (2007) has defined as an 'internalist--externalist'
distinction. The challenge for the securitization framework in this
sense is that the above are quite different in their conception of what
speech acts are and how they relate to audiences. [There is a **clear
need to** **clarify the position**]{.underline} on the above points to
draw the role [**of audiences** into the framework more
coherently]{.underline}, but in doing so the Copenhagen School will
almost certainly need to downplay either the performative effects of the
speech act or the inter-subjective nature of security.15 Ultimately,
those interested in the construction of security must pay attention to
the social, political and historical contexts in which particular
discourses of security (even those defined narrowly in terms of the
designation and articulation of threat) become possible. [Why are some
political communities more likely to view certain actors and dynamics as
threatening? What role do narratives of history, culture and identity
have in underpinning or legitimating particular forms of securitization?
To what extent is political possibility defined by the target audience
of speech acts? How are some voices empowered or marginalized to define
security and threat?]{.underline} These highly contextual factors, I
would suggest, are **[central to understanding how security works in
different contexts, but are ultimately given short shrift in the
securitization framework]{.underline}**. The appeal of universalism in
the development of a conceptual framework goes some way towards
explaining the neglect of contextual factors, but the [failure also to
draw out the ways in which securitizing actors and audiences interact
beyond the broad and amorphous recognition of 'facilitating conditions'
and being 'backed up' by relevant audiences is
unsatisfying.]{.underline}

**ST's focus on threats only tells a partial story of how security gets
meaning and is based on a logic of exclusion which reifys statis and
militaristic approaches to security**

[In the securitization framework, the study of security is ultimately
the study of the designation of threat.]{.underline} In this framework,
an issue is a security issue if European Journal of International
Relations 14(4) 578 positioned as a threat to a particular political
community. This commitment to the study of 'threats' is based on a
commitment to the idea that security is constituted in oppositional
terms: by designating that which it is not or that from which it needs
preservation or protection (Wæver, 1995: 56). Such a commitment is
consistent also with the oppositional conception of identity in the
securitization framework, wherein who we are is determined by the
designation of (threatening) others.21 In short, we can learn all we
need to know about the construction of security through studying the
issues that are represented as existential threats. As Michael Williams
(2003) has suggested, this oppositional view of the politics of security
is related to the Copenhagen School's indebtedness to the political
theory of Carl Schmitt. For Schmitt, politics in general is
characterized by enmity and exclusion, with the sovereign's designation
of threatening 'others' central to political life and allowing the
'exception': the suspension of the normal rules of politics. For the
securitization framework, such a vision of politics is particularly
applicable to the realm of security, which is characterized by the
articulation of threat and 'emergency measures' enabled by that
articulation. The Copenhagen School suggests that this political dynamic
captures something timeless about the logic of security itself, with the
realm of security an arena of exclusion and 'panic politics' (Buzan et
al., 1998: 34). This view of the logic of security has been central to
their call for desecuritization, a point I will return to in a moment.
Representations of threat --- pivotal to Schmittian security politics
--- can of course be viewed as constitutive of security and identity. As
Simon Dalby has argued, the designation of that from which we need to be
protected is crucial in telling us 'who we are, what we value and what
we are prepared to countenance to protect our self-preferred identities'
(Dalby, 2002: xxx). But is this the only way in which security is
constructed, and what do we miss through focusing only on the
designation of threat? I suggest here that while central, [a focus on
the designation of threat alone risks missing much about the
construction of security, especially through privileging the 'content'
of security over its meaning in particular contexts.]{.underline} As
noted, Roxanne Lynn Doty (1998/9) has suggested that radically different
approaches to immigration can be understood in the context of different
discourses of security. For Doty, changing approaches to the treatment
of Haitian refugees by the US government in the 1990s can primarily ---
and contra the Copenhagen School --- be understood as a change in the
way security itself was understood. And I have suggested elsewhere
(McDonald, 2003) that significant change in the Brazilian government's
approach to Amazonian deforestation in the late 1980s --- from
conceptualizing the intact rainforest as a threat to Brazil to
positioning it as that in need of being protected as part of Brazil ---
can be better understood as a change in perceptions McDonald:
Securitization and the Construction of Security 579 or discourses of
security rather than as an instance of 'de-securitization'. Here,
articulations of the values in need of being protected were more
prominent --- and I would suggest more politically significant --- than
articulations of 'from what or whom we need protection'. The **[focus on
the designation of threat alone therefore tells a partial story of how
security is given meaning, marginalizing inclusive and non-statist
definitions of 'our values' that tell us how security is understood in
particular contexts]{.underline}**.22 [More
problematically]{.underline}, the Copenhagen School [image of security
as acquiring meaning]{.underline} (or more accurately content) [through
the articulation of threat arguably works only to the extent that
**security is fixed in a Schmittian logic based on exclusion and
exception**]{.underline}.23 The 'fixedness' of the Copenhagen School's
logic of security has been taken up by 'Welsh School' critical security
theorists, for whom the study of security should be geared towards
recognizing and advancing opportunities for emancipation of the most
vulnerable. Ken Booth (2005: 207) and Paul Williams (2004: 144), for
example, have suggested that the securitization framework is parasitic
upon traditional (Realist) discourses of security that are taken as
indicative of a universal and timeless logic of security. This is
evident, for these theorists, in the Copenhagen School's commitment to
[strict boundaries of inclusion and exclusion; to the state and state
political leaders' centrality in defining (usually external) threats and
responses to them; and to the association of security means and tools
with the most significant of 'emergency measures': military
action]{.underline}. [This constitutes an important normative
problem]{.underline}, arguably **[serving to reify and normalize these
traditional statist, exclusionary and militaristic approaches to
security]{.underline}**. Indeed, the idea that the Copenhagen School's
logic of security is both relatively fixed and politically conservative
is a feature of even sympathetic readings of the securitization
framework (Huysmans, 1998: 500--1; Hansen, 2000: 286). In this context,
key proponents of the Copenhagen School (Wæver, 1995; 2000: 253; 2004;
Buzan et al., 1998: 204--9) have argued in favour of desecuritization:
the removal of issues from the security agenda. While recognizing the
possibility for securitization to be progressive (eg Wæver, 2000: 285),
the general suggestion is that 'it is better . . . to [aim for
desecuritization']{.underline} (Buzan and Wæver, 1998: 4). Here, the
Schmittian logic of security can be avoided and issues returned to the
open and deliberative realm of normal politics. [Important issues
surface again here about what constitutes normal politics and about the
relatively simplistic distinction between 'security' and
'politics']{.underline}. Analytically, it is certainly possible to
suggest that rather than constituting the opposite realm to that of
politics, debates around what constitutes security and how 'we' should
act to achieve or preserve it are particularly politically intense, even
a form of 'hyper-politics'. The logic of security upon which the
securitization framework is based might be contested again here, 579
European Journal of International Relations 14(4) 580 most prominently
the suggestion that security 'speech acts' can themselves take issues
outside the political realm. But the [suggestion that we should aim for
'desecuritization' is also normatively problematic. It **depicts
security as a failure of 'normal politics' rather than recognizing
security as a site of contestation and therefore for** (even
emancipatory) **change**]{.underline}. [This is especially important if
security is still that most powerful of political categories ---
defining political priority, a community's identity and its core values.
The focus only on the negative designation of threat serves the
interests of those who benefit from dominant negative and exclusionary
articulations of threat in contemporary international politics, further
**silencing voices articulating alternative visions for what security
means and how it might be realized.**]{.underline}

The relationship between ontological perceptions and definitions of
threat has been a topic of discussion in security studies for at least
two decades. At first, securitization theory was considered an
innovation in this area, since it maintains that security issues are
constructed as such not from the recognition of threats but from

204) related to intersubjective and shared understandings about
security. When securitization theory has no ontological assumptions, its
critical capacity enables reflections on power relations (for example,
coloniality and gender) that are reflected in the 'speech acts' produced
in the construction of a threat by a securitizing actor. However, some
criticism has been voiced regarding the character of the theory and its
possibilities as a critical perspective ([Bertrand,
2018](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Hansen,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
It has been argued that [the concept of securitization itself
presupposes power dynamics that underlie the very ability to securitize
through speech acts, so it does not include the subaltern as an actor in
security speech.]{.underline} We identify [a problem of silence due to
limited social representation, where people who are classified socially
in relation to their race, gender and class are portrayed as objects to
be protected or threats to be prevented, in a securitizing
vocabulary.]{.underline} This is related to a social imaginary where
they are portrayed as victims or transgressors ([Gentry and Sjoberg,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
This [can be seen in empirical studies of the process of
desecuritization of female combatants in the pacification of Sierra
Leone]{.underline} ([MacKenzie,
2009](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
and in the finding, in a study that draws openly on the concept of
intersectionality, [that refugee women are constructed as vulnerable
while male refugees are presented as a threat in the British
media]{.underline} ([Gray and Franck,
2019](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
The silencing is not a failure of securitization theory per se. [Buzan

Anglo-centric (and militaristic and patriarchal) bias'. Hence, our first
argument is [that the racist and patriarchal character of securitization
theory also permeates security studies and the field of international
relations]{.underline} ([Taylor,

[Neglect of certain dimensions and categories of analysis (especially
race and gender) is disguised as a supposed neutrality and as a
methodological choice regarding the analysis of speech acts. Thus,
desecuritized themes are banished to the sphere of so-called normal
politics]{.underline} ([Wæver,
1995](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))

Moreover, the Copenhagen School **[fails to realize that gender and race
issues are not always related to the societal security sector and may be
linked to the political security of states]{.underline}** ([Hansen,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Critical security studies has advanced reflection on security problems
regarding the exposure of groups of individuals in situations of
insecurity and practices of (in)securitization ([Bigo,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)),
and has introduced normative debates on the use of speech and/or
practices to understand security ([Hansen,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Many of the contributions to securitization theory, especially in
relation to the context and the audience of the securitization process
([Balzacq,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Léonard and Kaunert,
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)),
have been put to good use in research that aims to analyze the social
configurations of power in such processes. Accordingly, our concept of
securitization starts from the understanding of the classical
perspective -- that a [securitized problem is the intersubjective
construction of an existential threat. However]{.underline}, we build on
the basis of [a 'sociological' turn in securitization studies that
realizes that this process is established as an instrument of political
disputes and government practices]{.underline} ([Balzacq,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Opitz,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
In this sense, we understand and endorse many of the epistemological
criticisms of classical securitization theory, recognizing the
perspective that characterizing non-[Western cases as cases of
securitization may constitute a simplification of more complex
sociopolitical processes]{.underline} ([Wilkinson,
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
There are geopolitical limitations in the theoretical constructions that
permeate the area of security studies, from its beginnings to
contemporary times. We also realize that the 'periphery' of knowledge
production ([Tickner,
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
has not been included as a reflection on either side of recent debates
([Howell and Richter-Montpetit,
2020](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Wæver and Buzan,
2020](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Still, there is a critical potential to expand the analysis that
considers the social classification of people in securitization studies,
including its geopolitical dimensions. We want to emphasize that studies
that use the concept of securitization to demonstrate inequalities of
power in empirical processes have been conducted for some time (see
[Gray and Franck,

[Saeed,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Our concern is that these studies were intentionally ignored in the
critique of 'classical' theory by [Howell and Richter-Montpetit
(2020)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795),
although much of the literature that adopts the concept of
securitization generally recognizes its limitations and tries to
overcome them, usually by modifying it, to the point that we can speak
of 'theories of securitization' in the plural ([Balzacq,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
In a sense, at least the controversy over racism in securitization
theory has brought the required attention of [Wæver and Buzan
(2020)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)
to this debate, where (in the long answer) they recognize some of the
work that has been done in the field on race, racism and securitization.
Having overcome the limitations of analyzing colonial structures and
gender and race discourses, we recognize the potential for critical
security studies of having securitization as a tool, while researchers
have the possibility of politicizing securitization ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
35). Critical approaches can demonstrate that when we analyze government
discourses in relation to groups of individuals, whether they are
recognized as citizens or foreigners, to criminalize is to securitize.
**[Securitization theory has neglected the political effects of
colonialism and race as relevant categories to be analyzed in the
construction of threats]{.underline}** ([Moffette and Vadasaria,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
We understand social classification processes such as [genderization and
racialization should have a central role in the theory, since their
**insertion would complexify the understanding of power relations
involved in the securitization process, as well as the consequences of
being securitized -- and of being marginalized -- in that process**. So
far, however, coloniality, race, and gender have not had a prominent
role in securitization theory.]{.underline}

**The analysis of the securitization process doesn't account for
patriarchal and colonial power -- can't understand the dynamics of
international security**

As [Wæver
(1995](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
57) has observed, [the securitization process is related to power
dynamics: mainly the power of elites to establish threats and objects to
be referenced and protected.]{.underline} [Balzacq's
(2015)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)
interpretation also recognizes that securitization is made possible by a
situation in which the securitizing agent has the power to securitize;
therefore [it is hierarchical]{.underline}. This allows us to
acknowledge the possibilities and limitations of securitization as a
discourse and as a practice of power. Nevertheless,
[patriarchal]{.underline} ([Pateman,
1988](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
[and colonial]{.underline} ([Mignolo,

[power have not yet been incorporated as central elements in the
analysis of securitization processes.]{.underline} [Decolonial studies
has been instrumental in exposing that traditional theorists understand
power less well than they believe, since they obscure and exclude much
of the existing power dynamics from analysis and ignore
hierarchies]{.underline}. The decolonial turn recognizes that specific
historical conditions are constituting processes that classify people
and states socially and subjectively within world capitalism and
colonial logic ([Quijano,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
[Similarly, gender is produced and propagated through speech, which in
turn are causally related to the power relations between individuals,
groups, and states, as well as the functioning of the capitalist
production system and international security dynamics]{.underline}
([Gentry and Sjoberg,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
While the roots of security studies are intertwined with international
relations, it is understood as bordering different disciplines, so it
can potentially engage with other areas ([Buzan and Hansen,
2009](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Consequently, it is possible to bring security studies closer to the
discussions of coloniality as configurations of power. Although we have
not found studies that used decolonial feminism to theorize about
securitization or critical security studies, we realize that it has the
potential to address many of the limitations we identify. [The **concept
of intersectionality is essential for understanding the main structures
of modern society -- patriarchy, racism, and capitalism -- that
demarcate people's lives and political processes, and, consequently, the
dynamics of international security**. These social structures that
interact with each other create the categories of women, race, and
class]{.underline} ([Davis,
1981](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
[that segregate and hierarchize social groups.]{.underline} In dialogue
with intersectional theory, decolonial feminism ([Lugones,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
places these three dimensions in an international perspective,
emphasizing the idea of coloniality. Thus, patriarchy, racism, and
capitalism are the main social structures strongly demarcated by
historical colonialism and its roots in the economy, politics and
culture that persist to the present day, establishing what Lugones
defines as the 'colonial/modern gender system'. Although these concepts
can lead to different paths of analysis, their epistemological common
ground allows us to advocate that coloniality, racialization, and
genderization are products of historical constructions, neither
universal nor essential. Culturally and historically situated analysis
[of securitization processes has the capacity to incorporate social
classification configurations such as racialization and genderization,
although we do not see this happening very often]{.underline}. We intend
to illustrate in the next section how the conduct of empirical research
plays a decisive role in efforts to analyze the social configurations of
power in securitization processes.

In this section, we describe how civilizationist thought underpins
securitization theory's concepts of politics and security.
Civilizationism is a term used to describe racist (theoretical)
perspectives that contain three assumptions: (1) Civilizations can, and
ought to, advance, and some (Western) civilizations are more 'advanced';
(2) civilizational progress is not only technological and material, but
political and moral; and (3) the 'underdevelopment' of certain
civilizations represents a problem for, or threat to, developed ones.
Drawing on a broad canon of civilizationist political philosophy,
canonical [securitization theory texts develop a narrative of
world-historical progress in which civilizational advancement beyond the
violence of 'primal anarchy' involves curtailing securitization through
the instantiation of civilized 'normal politics'. Classic securitization
theory frequently and favorably cites Samuel Huntington's
racist]{.underline} ([Said,

Social theorists such as Durkheim, who built his theory of society on
racist anthropological distinctions between civilized men and savages

anarchy' and the 'state of nature' act as the foils to this 'normal

1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
53, 69). Following Hobbes, securitization theory locates this supposed
progress in the West, particularly Europe: It perhaps begins with the
construction of the Hobbesian state in the eighteenth century. The
creation of the Leviathan was aimed at opening a sphere of public
economic and political life, and this could not be done without pushing
the use of force back into a contained space controlled by the state.
Under the Leviathan, citizens could not draw swords over economic
grievances or political disagreements, which were to be handled by the
rule of law and the market. The logic of existential threat and the
right to use force ... were reserved to the state and thus were largely
*desecuritized* among the citizens. ([Buzan et al.,

[and *minimizing securitization* as integral to civilizational

theory. In addition to thinkers easily identified as civilizationist, it
also draws on apparently more critical theorists, notably Arendt.
Responding to Foucauldian critiques that describe securitization
theory's conceptualization of security as the exception to politics as
Schmittian, [Wæver
(2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
470) argues that these critics have misunderstood: 'it is wrong to claim
... that securitization theory involves a "Schmittian" concept of
politics -- the theory has a Schmittian concept of security and an
Arendtian concept of politics', further clarifying that: The concept of
*security* is Schmittian, because it defines security in terms of
exception, emergency, and a decision (although not by a singular will,
but among people in a political situation). This does not in itself make
securitization theory's concept of *politics* Schmittian, because the
place of security in the theory is as an anti-politics or the
politically constituted limit to politics. This general politics is
inspired by Hannah Arendt. ([Wæver,
2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):

122) summarizes Arendt's concept of politics: 'politics takes place
among people, in-between us, because power only emerges when people act
together, it basically consists of action directed to and dependent on
the reaction of others, not doing things directly'. Here, he adverts to
Arendt's distinction between power (*Macht*) and violence (*Gewalt*),
which securitization theory mirrors by dividing politicization from
securitization. Arendt drew on racist German anthropology that
distinguished between (uncivilized) 'nature people' (*Naturvölker*) and
(civilized) 'cultured people' (*Kulturvölker*) ([Klausen,

396). She cast the former as (morally and politically) superior and
warned that the latter's 'primitivism' posed a threat to political
freedom and democracy. When [securitization theory adopts Arendt's
concept of politics, it does not dispense with her civilizationism but
replicates and develops it, conceptualizing 'normal politics' as the
achievement of civilized people capable of resisting violence
(securitization) through reasoned dialogue
(politicization).]{.underline} Securitization theory also replicates
Arendt's evacuation of violence from politics. [Arendt]{.underline}
built her idea of power (*Macht*) on an idealized vision of the Athenian
*polis*, ignoring the 'raw materials' of ancient Athenian democracy --
slave labor and women's unpaid reproductive labor ([James,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):

Classic [securitization theory is civilizationist in that it believes
that there are more or less politically and morally developed
civilizations]{.underline}. [It **identifies 'normal politics' with
(European) civilization and 'securitization' with a return to
(racialized) primal anarchy**]{.underline}. As a result, it **[depicts
'underdeveloped' civilizations as threats to supposedly more advanced
ones]{.underline}**. This becomes especially clear when examining
securitization theory's ideas about 'state failure'. [Securitization
theory claims that in 'developed' states]{.underline} ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
28) [a civilized political sphere generally fends off securitization,
except when ']{.underline}securitization is unavoidable, as when [states

([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
29). By contrast, [in 'failed' or 'weak' states securitization runs
amok:]{.underline} 'In well-developed states, armed forces and
intelligence services are carefully separated from normal political
life, and their use is subject to elaborate procedures of authorization.
Where such separation is not in place, as in many weak states ... much
of normal politics is pushed into the security realm' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
28). This excessive securitization, in turn, leads to primal (or
'Hobbesian' or 'Kaplanesque') anarchy, wherein the state 'fails to take
root or spirals into disintegration. This situation can lead to
prolonged periods of *primal anarchy*, as is currently the case in
Afghanistan and various parts of Africa, in which the state is only a
shadow and reality is one of rival warlords and gangs' ([Buzan et al.,

While they may avoid overt reference to race, [they operate within a
lineage of racial discourse that emerged to justify colonialism and
continuing trusteeship]{.underline}. [This racial hierarchy is fully
represented in securitization theory's list of weak and failing states:
Nigeria under Abacha, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Liberia, and
'various parts of Africa', the USSR under Stalin, Bosnia, Colombia,
Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and so on]{.underline} (see [Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
28, 50, 69, 146). This is a racial discourse: '[primal anarchy' is
primarily located in 'brown' ('Afghanistan') and 'black' ('parts of
Africa') regions.]{.underline} Copenhagen School theorists sometimes
seem to be aware of how this division falls. This does not lead them to
question it. On the contrary, they warn against Western-centrism, but
only in order to emphasize that it is in the West that 'normal'
civilized politics exists: 'if domestic and international were fixed,
there would be a risk of generating a cozy Western view of politics:
Domestic politics is normal and without security, whereas the extreme is
relegated to the international space. In other parts of the world,
domestic is not cozy' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
47n7). For securitization theory, primal anarchy exists, not only in the
international realm, but also in non-Western 'other parts of the world',
where a failure of normal politics leads to '"tribalist" forms of
association' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
69). Securitization theory refuses to seriously consider the role of
modern colonialism and ongoing imperial warfare in 'failed states'. Such
consideration might reveal the significance of Western colonial
divide-and-rule policies, extraction of resources and labor, imposition
of state borders, and military and covert intervention. Instead,
securitization theory frames 'failed states' as evidence of a primal
state of nature. Civilizationism is not just a collateral, detachable,
part of securitization theory's imaginary, or a sadly unattended-to
implication of its Kaplanesque view of anarchy or its Arendtian model of
politics. [The idea that there has been (white) civilizational progress
away from (racialized) primal anarchy is omnipresent in securitization
theory because it is fundamental to securitization theory's opposition
between politicization and securitization.]{.underline} Ungrounded in
the racist and civilizationist narrative that 'normal politics' emerged
from 'primal anarchy', this opposition would look as arbitrary as it in
fact is.

**ALT fails - The framework of ST problematically excludes images and
physical act which maintains communications of security in the squo**

McDonald, 08 \-\-- International Relations, University of Queensland
(Matt McDonald, \" Securitization and the Construction of Security\",

For the Copenhagen School, [issues become security issues]{.underline}
(or more accurately threats) [through language.]{.underline} It is
language that positions specific actors or issues as existentially
threatening to a particular political community, thus enabling (or
indeed constituting, depending on interpretation) securitization.
Indeed, rather than simply being one 'site' of security construction,
Wæver (1995) located securitization itself in language theory, and
particularly Austin's articulation of the 'speech act'. [In this
framework, language itself becomes security in the sense that particular
forms of language --- spoken or written in a particular context ---
constitute security]{.underline}. As Wæver argued (1995: 55), 'the
utterance itself is the act . . . by uttering "security", a
staterepresentative moves a particular development into a specific area,
and thereby claims a special right to use whatever means necessary to
block it'. This reliance on language as the exclusive form of
'securitizing move' is problematic for two reasons. [First, language is
only one]{.underline} (albeit the most central) [means through which
meaning is communicated]{.underline} (Möller, 2007: 180). A range of
authors in this context have suggested the [need to take account of the
role of images as potential forms of securitization.]{.underline}
Second, an exclusive McDonald: Securitization and the Construction of
Security 569 [focus on language is problematic in the sense that it can
exclude forms of bureaucratic practices or physical action that do not
merely follow from securitizing 'speech acts' but are part of the
process through which meanings of security are communicated and security
itself constructed]{.underline}. As noted, a range of authors have
suggested that images or visual representations can be central to the
construction of security generally or even securitization specifically.
Michael Williams (2003) has suggested that [television images of 11
September --- and in particular those of the World Trade Center towers
--- were central to the development of dominant perceptions of security
and threat in the American context.]{.underline} Frank Möller (2007)
also discusses visual representations of the 11 September attacks ---
along with conflict in Iraq --- in pointing to the ways in which
[**photographic exhibitions are similarly able to communicate particular
meanings of security and threat**.]{.underline} Lene Hansen (2007),
meanwhile, uses the example of the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad
published in a Danish newspaper in 2005 in pointing to the potentially
central role of visual representations as forms of securitization.
[Extending the securitization framework to include these forms of
representation]{.underline} (as Williams suggests) [would certainly be
more reflective of the range of forms through which meaning ---
including about security and threat --- can be
communicated.]{.underline} But such inclusion may not be as simple as it
appears. At a general level, the centrality of Austin's theory of
language to the broader framework suggests the need for developing or
building on an alternative theory of the performative role of security
representations. More specifically, the challenge for the Copenhagen
School here may be that visual representations raise difficult questions
about agency, intentionality and the importance of contestation over
meaning. While the classical application of the securitization framework
has focused on the role of political leaders in the articulation and
designation of threat, in the above examples of visual representation
the key 'securitizing actors' are artists and the media. Incorporating
visual representation into the securitization framework, therefore, may
involve simultaneously rethinking the centrality that state political
elite have in the framework itself. The role of intentionality is
important in this context. Copenhagen School proponents portray a
securitizing move as a highly intentional, strategic action. Buzan et
al. (1998: 21) argue that the designation of 'threats justifies the use
of extraordinary measures to handle them', further noting that the
'invocation of security has been the key to legitimizing the use of
force' (my emphases). More directly, Wæver (1995: 63) has argued that
'the logic around which the whole issue of security has been framed' is
'among strategic actors imbued with intentionality'. Such an image of
strategic actors seeking to justify emergency responses arguably fits
poorly with the communication of visual images, undertaken by actors
(such as the media) less likely to be seeking to engage European Journal
of International Relations 14(4) 570 in particular emergency measures or
in a position to undertake them. And as Möller (2007: 185) and Hansen
(2007) have argued, images are ambiguous in meaning, making it harder to
control the meaning others take away from them. This renders the
strategic use of images more difficult, while also pointing to the
importance of contestation over meaning central to security politics. An
alternative argument concerning the 'narrowness' of the Copenhagen
School's exclusive focus on speech is advanced by Didier Bigo (2002) and
the so-called 'Paris School'.9 For these theorists, security is
constructed and applied to different issues and areas through a range of
often routinized practices rather than only through specific speech acts
that enable emergency measures. Practices of surveillance and border
controls, for example, particularly as undertaken by bureaucrats or
'professional managers of unease' (Bigo, 2002: 65), are a central part
of securitization, and are not simply those actions enabled by preceding
speech acts. For these theorists, 'to attend to the study of
securitization is to focus on the creation of networks of professionals
of (in)security, the systems of meaning they generate and the productive
power of their practices' (Case Collective, 2006: 458). This stands in
opposition to the conception of security in the securitization
framework, in which security practices follow speech acts and in which
security is the realm of dramatic emergency measures. [Recognizing the
role of apparently mundane and everyday physical actions in the
construction of security serves to question the speech-physical action
sequence of the securitization framework and points to the multiple
forms in which meaning can be communicated]{.underline}. The 'everyday
practices' of the 'managers of unease', for example, would seem destined
to be excluded from the securitization framework, reliant as it is on a
conception of the politics-- security relationship that emphasizes the
[extraordinary forms of action that follow from the construction of
threats through speech]{.underline}. This maps on to criticisms raised
by Hansen (2000: 300--1) and Wilkinson (2007) that the Copenhagen School
[framework problematically neglects physical action generally, action
which can serve to communicate ideas about security in their own
right]{.underline}.10 It is far more possible to envisage images and
visual representation being drawn into the securitization framework as
forms of 'securitizing moves', a project advocated and furthered by
Williams (2003) and Hansen (2007) respectively.11 But even here there
are challenges, not least of all related to the questions of ambiguity,
intentionality and the traditional centrality of speech and the speech
act to the framework itself.

We have established that securitization theory is founded in a
civilizationist conceptualization of politics and security that occludes
racial and colonial violence. We now demonstrate that, on the basis of
these assumptions, securitization theory develops a methodologically and
normatively white theory. As postcolonial, critical race, and feminist
scholarship argues, [methodology involves making choices about whose
perspectives or histories we (de)value.]{.underline} [Bhambra
(2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921)
defines [methodological whiteness as a way of reflecting on the world
that fails to acknowledge the role played by race in the very
structuring of that world, and of the ways in which knowledge is
constructed and legitimated within it.]{.underline} It fails to
recognize the dominance of 'Whiteness' as anything other than the
standard state of affairs and treats a limited perspective -- that
deriving from White experience -- as a universal perspective. Operating
in supposedly neutral and universal terms, methodological whiteness
naturalizes the racial status quo, eliding the crucial role of racism in
political systems or intellectual traditions. [Bertrand
(2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921)
has critiqued securitization theory's methodology for setting up a
colonial relation wherein subalterns cannot speak and securitization
theorists speak for them. Our critique is somewhat different: we argue
that [since securitization theory aspires to describe not just 'what is'
but 'what should be', its methodological whiteness also becomes
normative whiteness.]{.underline} To illustrate this argument, we
evaluate securitization theory's incorporation of speech act theory and
ask how it interfaces with its civilizationist conceptualizations of
politics and security. Securitization theory bases its methodology in J.
L. Austin's notion of illocutionary speech acts: forms of speech having
some element of force, such as making a promise or giving a warning.
Combining this with an Arendtian concept of politics seems intuitive:
Arendt defined politics as action through communication, and Austin
provides a method for analyzing communication as action. Notably, this
methodology enacts a normative stance, being designed to 'protect'
Arendtian normal politics: [Securitization theory was built from the
start on speech act theory, because it is an operational method that can
be designed to protect politics in Arendt's sense.]{.underline} Put in
short form, the political conception of securitization theory is
*inspired by Arendt, implemented through speech act theory*. ([Wæver,
2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
122, emphasis in original) As we have seen, by defining violence as
outside politics, [Arendt failed to acknowledge that, by virtue of
gender and racialization, some people are produced as the 'raw
materials' of others' political freedom. **When securitization theory
claims that the purpose of its method is to protect Arendtian 'normal
politics', it implicitly undertakes to defend the status quo of a
violent international racial order.**]{.underline} To begin, we can
observe that [securitization theory does not challenge the ways in which
structures of speech acts (like law, civil hierarchy, or international
treaties) are and have been central to enforcing a colonial system of
global inequality]{.underline}. On the contrary, [securitization theory
is structured]{.underline}, through its apparent neutrality, [to
supplement and reinforce those structures:]{.underline} Our relative
objectivism on social relations has the drawback of [contributing to the
reproduction of things as they are,]{.underline} of contributing to the
taking for granted that \[critical security studies\] wants to upset.
The advantage is -- totally in line with classical security studies --
to help in managing relations among units. ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
206) While acknowledging this methodological and normative investment in
[maintaining the status quo as a 'drawback']{.underline}, the authors
claim it is worth the price. 'Managing relations among units' --
maintaining order -- is a higher priority than justice. And how is order
to be maintained? By [preventing civilized 'normal politics' from
'regressing' into a 'state of nature':]{.underline} Austin gives us
insights into the capacity of mankind \[*sic*\] for creating shared
environments through language.... Herein lies *the power of human
civilization, as opposed to the 'state of nature';* the power which
alone makes it possible, on occasion, for someone weak and without
weapons to be listened to and even obeyed, the power which makes it
possible to conceive and pursue things such as social equality or
solidarity and equal opportunities for genders, *all of which would not
be conceivable in a 'state of nature' ethology*. To acknowledge in
theory and investigate such power is at the same time to foster and
defend it against the *regression into forms of social life based on
brute force and coercion*. ([Wæver,
2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
121, emphasis added) Although this passage avoids overt mention of race,
it mobilizes a racial imaginary. Its argument is that [through the use
of language to form social contracts, civilized people lift themselves
above the savage 'state of nature' and create a public political
sphere.]{.underline} This superiority is evidenced by the capacity for
(Western, liberal) discourses like 'equal opportunities for genders'
(here, securitization theory echoes imperial feminism's racist claim
that gender equality is most advanced in the West and should be
exported, especially to 'Muslim' societies). However, while traditional
Hobbesian social contract theory views the social contract in
quasi-legal terms as happening once for all in the past, securitization
theory redefines it as continuously intersubjectively produced through
speech acts, and therefore constantly in need of reproduction. [For
securitization theory, white Western superiority]{.underline} is
therefore precarious: [it must be protected from (excessive)
securitization that risks a 'regression' to a lower level of
civilization or a fully uncivilized 'state of nature'.]{.underline} This
passage does not merely retell a classic civilizationist narrative in
newer philosophical language. *It operationalizes this narrative, making
its assumptions into a method.* If the ability to do things with words
and not force distinguishes civilized man, it argues, then to analyze
'how to do things with words' via Austin's method must be *in itself* to
step to the defense of civilized normal politics. [Securitization theory
offers a methodological procedure by which the scholar can observe that
a speech act meets the criteria for 'securitization' and make normative
statements about whether it should be heeded. For securitization theory,
when we deploy this methodology, we inherently proceed in a civilized
manner and so contribute to and protect illocutionary, Arendtian
politics.]{.underline}

To illustrate the empirical consequences of this methodological and
normative whiteness, consider how [securitization theory refuses to
distinguish between white nationalist and racial justice
movements:]{.underline} The radical white categorizations often line up
with the attempts of the avowed progressives of the movements of
minorities, multiculturalism, and political correctness to produce a
general U.S. trend toward a redefinition of cultural and societal
categories in terms of distinct racial and gender groups. The one side
wants these groups recognized to ensure affirmative action in favor of
the disfavored; the other side wants to use these categories to picture
minorities as the threat to them and thereby to the whole. ([Buzan et
al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
130) The above passage is not a mistake. Similar lines of thought are
articulated elsewhere, for instance in relation to the threat of
'radical feminism' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
54). [Securitization theory frames racial justice and white nationalist
movements as equivalent: both **potentially securitize cultural and
racial categories**.]{.underline} This framing is a [result of
securitization theory's methodological whiteness, its inability to ask
questions about racialized, gendered, and (settler-)colonial orders, and
its general **preference for order over justice**.]{.underline} It is
also a normative stance[. Securitization theory aims to use speech act
theory to defend normal politics from (excessive) securitization,
*including by racial justice movements.* Racial justice, by extension,
becomes a danger, threatening regression into a (racially coded) lower
level of civilization or, worse, primal anarchy.]{.underline}

Despite the limitations set out above, securitization theory proves to
be useful in enabling the analysis of power dynamics involved in state
security discourses and the construction of threats as an instrument of
state governmentality ([Opitz,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
Feminist approaches to security and decolonial feminism, in turn,
complement structural analysis by exposing the modern state as a
gendered and racialized construction. The second argument of this
intervention is a defense of empirical studies as a way of overcoming
the neglects of the classical perspective of securitization theory by
analyzing how the dimensions of coloniality intervene in processes of
securitization. To illustrate how an empirical turn can make the case
for securitization theory, we present our research on the construction
of racialized women who actively participate in political life as a
threat to the governmentality of the modern state. Our [investigation
focused on the case of Milagro Sala, an indigenous woman who is the
leader of the organization Tupac Amaru in Argentina and who was arrested
in 2016. The organization is linked to several different ethnic groups,
such as the Mapuche, the Guarani, and the Kollas.]{.underline} The
[objective of our study was to analyze how the process of securitization
in this case is intertwined with processes of racialization and
genderization.]{.underline} With this example, which reinforces the
requirement for theoretical openness, [we seek to demonstrate the
importance of methodological openness and empirical research that
employs the variables race and gender in studies of securitization
processes. Sala was elected as a member of the Mercosur Parliament, the
civil representation body of the trade bloc's member-states, at the end
of 2015, and arrested shortly afterwards, in January 2016, because she
was perceived as being the 'organizer' of a protest in front of the seat
of government in Argentina's Jujuy province.]{.underline}
[Sala]{.underline} [and other activists from Tupac Amaru were accused of
several crimes in relation to their protest in Jujuy, and legal
recognition of the organization was suspended by Executive Decree
402-G.]{.underline} [We conducted our analysis of these events using
content analysis and critical discourse analysis of political and media
discourses]{.underline}. The political speeches we analyzed were from 13
statements and interviews published in the newspaper *La Nación* during
2016, given by the governor of Jujuy, Gerardo Morales, and by
Argentina's president, Mauricio Macri, as well as by official
representatives and allies of their governments. We also analyzed the
decrees that removed legal recognition and government funding for Tupac
Amaru (Decree No. 402-G and Decree No. 403-G, promulgated in the
'Official Diary' of the province of Jujuy on 13 January 2016). [From the
analysis of the data, we identified the state as the main actor in the
securitization process under study]{.underline}. [We verified the
state's actions through]{.underline} an examination of: (i) [the
speeches of Gerardo Morales (provincial governor), Mauricio Macri
(president of Argentina), and their coalition allies]{.underline} in
their respective governments, [which reinforce an image of both Sala and
the Tupac Amaru organization as enemies of the population of
Jujuy]{.underline}; and (ii) the executive decrees that criminalized the
political demonstrations that were being held in front of the provincial
government headquarters, which were published shortly after Morales took
over the government of Jujuy province. Several international movements
and organizations[^1^](javascript:popRef('fn1-09670106211027795'))
denounced the criminalization of Tupac Amaru activists, highlighting the
arbitrary arrest of Milagro Sala. This made it difficult to legitimize
the process, but did not prevent the final decision of the state
apparatus. [Sala was sentenced to three years for the protest conducted
outside the headquarters of the Jujuy government and barred from holding
a position in any social organization.]{.underline} After her arrest,
the Argentine government constantly tried to legitimize the process.
Sala was granted house arrest after the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights (IACHR) requested a precautionary measure for her detention
([Rodríguez Niell,
2017](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
We therefore conclude that the actions of international organizations
such as the IACHR had drawn attention to the case, which made it more
difficult to establish the criminalization and securitization processes.
However, the house arrest was revoked less than a month after its
concession, and Sala subsequently returned to regular imprisonment. In
relation to the gender variable, we observe that references to danger
and violence were made more frequently in relation to Sala than to the
organization as a whole. The statement that 'she was the leader of an
organization that politically managed a province' was a constant (see,
for example, [*La Nación*,
2016a](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
[As a political leader, **Sala was constructed as being manipulative,
dangerous, and violent -- a treatment that reinforces the
view**]{.underline}**,** highlighted by [Pateman
(1988)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795),
**[that women should not be in the political space and, if they are, it
is because they are not good women.]{.underline}** For our analysis, we
also draw on fieldwork carried out by [Tabbush and Gaona
(2017](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
315), who regard the actions against Tupac Amaru as an example of
criminalization of 'female activists who question entrenched racial,
gender, and class inequalities in Latin America' given the large numbers
of women in leadership positions within the organization. [Tabbush and
Gaona
(2017](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
316) conclude that [the persecution of the Tupac Amaru movement is
related to 'the circulation of radicalized hatred in a multi-ethnic
society', and that the government's policy is based on an alleged need
to 'save' the poor women and men who belong to the
organization.]{.underline} In relation to the race variable, we observed
that [no explicit references were made to the indigenous issue and that
Sala was not enunciated as an indigenous person in any of the political
discourses we analyzed. This fact highlights deracialization as a form
of securitization]{.underline}. This process by which 'deracialization'
is [used as a way to legitimize the criminalization of socially
classified groups is related to what [Moffette and Vadasaria
(2016)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)
perceive as the link between securitization and racial
governmentality]{.underline}. As deracialization is not explicit in the
speeches analyzed, we can only perceive its colonial dimensions when we
approach the context -- in this case, the construction of Latin America,
the Argentine state and its whiteness policies. [While Sala herself uses
the rhetoric of race, referring to herself as black, and the
organization of which she is a part has an indigenous name, the
apparatus of power silences this dimension]{.underline}. In the
Argentinian case, then, [race intervenes to deracialize, to diminish the
strength of the indigenous movement.]{.underline} Our findings thus
contribute to the discussions about [deracialization as an instrument of
power]{.underline}, reinforcing the argument that Latin American ideas
about miscegenation ([Martínez-Echazábal,
1998](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Van Dijk,
2005](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
were meant to hide racism and continue to be a method of silencing black
and indigenous movements. Our findings thus appear to be relevant for
several discussions about deracialization as an instrument of power in
Latin America ([Briones,
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);

[Segato,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)),
reinforcing the idea that 'race' was politicized by the state for
purposes of homogenization, this time based on the concept of
'mestizaje'. Whiteness played a strategic role in the project to
homogenize the Argentine nation, where the participation of immigrants
from Europe was extolled, while African and indigenous influences were
rendered invisible in the nation's historical-social and cultural
construction. The imaginary that the nation is 'plural' at the same time
that European descent is magnified can even be used as a resistance
strategy when socially classified groups question pre-established
categories of 'race' ([Escolar,
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
104--105), but it mainly reflects the invisibility of the indigenous
population. The term 'ethnocidal miscegenation' was coined to refer to a
strategy to silence the participation of indigenous and Afro-Latino
populations in Latin American societies that built the idea of
'mestizaje'. The removal of racial/ethnic identifications in official
population statistics and censuses in Argentina has been verified
empirically by [López
(2006)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)
and [Segato
(2010)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795).
Against this background, we could observe in our results what has been
identified as 'silenced racialization' of the indigenous population,
whereby speech can be racialized even if such racialization is not done
formally ([Briones,
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795):
77). We also carried out an analysis of media discourse in order to
assess the extent to which the securitization process had met with
acceptance and been regarded as legitimate. Our analysis was centered on
the newspaper *La Nación*, since this is a recognized source of
information on Argentina and has dedicated specific sections to the case
of Sala and Tupac Amaru. More than one hundred news stories from 2016
were analyzed. As in the political speeches, [the threat posed by Sala
and her leadership role were underlined -- often appearing together, as
occurred in 31 news stories.]{.underline} As an example, one of these
reports, published four days after Sala's arrest on 16 January 2016,
states that '[*thief, gangster* and *threatening* are three of the
softest words people use to describe Milagro Sala]{.underline} when
asked who she is' ([*La Nación*,
2016b](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
The articles emphasized the organization's 'accumulated power', and the
idea that Tupac Amaru constituted a 'parallel state' in the province of
Jujuy was also reiterated. We see in this a ['**coloniality of
security'**]{.underline} ([Lucero,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795))
**[that finds danger when communities inside the state practice any
degree of self-determination, causing the state to perceive
self-determination and difference as a threat.]{.underline}** Rooted in
power relations, [the media discourses that we analyzed play an
important role in the securitization process since they articulate
affective dimensions on which the social representations of Sala and the
Tupac Amaru organization are built.]{.underline} [**Sala is not
represented as a woman who is the leader of an ethnic organization of
political and territorial resistance, but as a violent and dangerous
woman who has accumulated power in the province**.]{.underline} This
establishes an affective dimension of aversion: given that a significant
part of the Jujuy population identifies itself as indigenous ([Tabbush
and Gaona,
2017](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)),
the [failure to identify the organization and its leaders as indigenous
prevents any form of empathy from being built in relation to
them.]{.underline} Our analysis also allowed us to perceive [various
discursive disputes present in the securitization process, mainly
related to the fact that Sala is a woman, indigenous and a
parliamentarian.]{.underline} The [exposure by international
organizations of the race and gender dynamics present in Sala's
imprisonment is constructed by the media as a defense
'rhetoric']{.underline}, as if the use of such terms represented an
attempt to 'cover up the crimes' of Sala. Paradoxically, Sala is
constantly described as a violent woman. The Tupac Amaru movement
employs a strategy of acting transnationally in an attempt to
'counter-balance' its confrontation with the state and securitization in
the domestic arena, a characteristic also seen in several other social
movements in Latin America (see [López,
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795);
[Lucero,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211027795)).
In other words, our analysis showed that [state authorities and the
media engage in a silencing of the racial and gender dimension as a way
of legitimizing the criminalization of the activities of Sala and Tupac
Amaru, while international organizations and the Tupac Amaru
organization itself emphasize these dimensions as a form of political
resistance]{.underline}. [Race and gender thus proved to be important
variables that intervened in the process by which Milagro Sala was
securitized -- in ways that are not immediately obvious]{.underline}.
The case analyzed here thus reinforces our argument about the need for
empirical research on how the variables of gender and race interfere in
securitization processes.

Does securitization theory overcome, replicate, or deepen antiblack
thought on 'Africa'? Certainly, securitization theory sees a tendency
towards primal anarchy and the 'state of nature' in many non-Western
parts of the world (the Balkans; Eastern Europe; Central, South, and
East Asia; the Middle East; and South America), but 'Africa' is
particularly maligned. Often, classic [securitization theory treats the
entire continent as a single entity, a space where normal politics is
weak and oversecuritized, the state or social contract
fails]{.underline} (or was never established), [and 'man' reverts to (or
never left) the state of nature]{.underline}. *'Africa is a pessimist's
paradise, a place where the Hobbesian hypothesis that in the absence of
a political Leviathan life for individuals will be nasty, brutish, and
short seems to be widely manifest in everyday life'* ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
219). Elsewhere, however, it adds some complexity by seeing Africa in
terms of multiple temporalities, being both 'premodern', having elements
of the 'modern', and threatening a 'back to the future' scenario. On the
one hand, a book like *Regions and Powers* ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921))
offers a sweeping history of Europe over millennia (containing little
mention of colonialism), but a history of Africa that covers only
official decolonization and the post--Cold War era: a matter of mere
decades. Completely missing is any historical account of how colonialism
and enslavement shaped not only African but also European security
relations ([Agathangelou and Ling,
2004b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921);

and the idea of Europe itself ([Mudimbe,

[Said,
1979](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921)).
Conversely, another canonical [securitization theory text asserts that
'in the contemporary international system, some *prestate* referent
objects are still active. The remnants of *tribal barbarians still
exist* in parts of Central Asia and Africa.]{.underline} Some hint of
how these tribes *worked* as referent objects for military security can
be gleaned from contemporary civil wars in Afghanistan and Somalia'
([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
53, emphasis added). The past-tense '[worked' here implies that we can
learn about premodern times (in Europe) by looking at present-day
Afghanistan or Somalia, whose backwards 'tribal barbarian' populations
constitute a *pre*state referent.]{.underline} These two temporalities
come together in the statement that 'in Africa, the main societal
referent objects are a mix of premodern -- the extended family, village,
clan, and tribe -- and modern, the "state-nation"' ([Buzan et al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
126). [Securitization theory, then, sees Africa as temporally anomalous
-- that is, both premodern and modern -- because it manifests both a
postcolonial present and a potential degeneration to a
precolonial/premodern past,]{.underline} as when [Buzan and Wæver
(2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
221), drawing from other authors, including Kaplan, speculate that: the
period of colonization and decolonization might, in the long view,
appear as something of an interlude, a period with its own distinctive
characteristics, rather than a point of permanent transformation from
premodern to modern. If back-to-the-future pessimism is right, then what
we are looking at now is some phase in the terminal collapse of the
Westphalian experiment in Africa. This passage outlines a 'back to the
future' scenario in which Africa returns to its default state of
precolonial, tribal, anarchic statelessness. Here, as elsewhere,
[securitization theory does not entirely ignore histories of
colonization:]{.underline} it admits that colonialism had an impact on
Africa, [but it understands this impact not as an extraction of
resources and labor and a violent transformation of people into chattel,
but **as an 'experiment' aimed at bringing the European Westphalian
state to 'premodern' barbarians**]{.underline} (see [Buzan and Wæver,

appears not as a project of liberation but as a potential backslide into
primal anarchy]{.underline} ([Buzan and Wæver,

is 'Africa' missing this opportunity? [Securitization theory's
methodological whiteness leads it to assert,]{.underline} without
substantiation, [that the cause of this backsliding must be not the
ongoing extractive violence of liberal powers but the failure of African
people and states to 'desecuritize':]{.underline} Because political
violence has been such an endemic feature of the African landscape, and
because the crisis of the African state is so central to the pervasive
insecurity on the continent, we will take the existence of systematic
political violence to indicate the presence of a dominant
securitization. ([Buzan and Wæver,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):
223) This is strikingly circular reasoning, where premises and
conclusions guarantee each other. Securitization theory starts, as we
have seen, from the axioms that 'normal politics' tames violence and
irrational securitizations threaten 'normal politics'. [Seeing Africa as
a violent, anarchic space, lacking in 'normal' civilized politics,
securitization theory assumes this must be because securitization has
run amok. As a result, **African 'dominant securitization' can be taken
for granted, as a foil to the supposed peacefulness of Europe**, and
therefore as evidence that 'normal politics' tames violence, and so
on.]{.underline} Securitization theory here turns an antiblack narrative
of African (a)history (Africa is primitive, violent, anachronistic) into
an equally antiblack normative proposition: that [Africa is culpable for
failing to produce 'normal politics'. European colonial violence is
occluded or, worse, exonerated]{.underline}: many African elites
publicly embraced a negative view of globalization, and took the view
that their weak position in the global periphery was a major explanation
for their difficulties. This led to a convenient rhetoric of
'neo-colonial' securitization that sought, often successfully, to divert
attention from the indigenous causes of Africa's difficulties. ([Buzan

**Desecuritization fails**

**Desecuritization fails -- foundations laid will always be replaced by
new threats**

Briefly returning to the 'operational' critique which we touched upon
previously, it is possible to also unpack this question of the 'limits'
of desecuritization in a second, 'strong' sense---as indicative of a
more *general* political irreducibility of 'security', which would have
the rather significant implication that [there is a *structural*
impossibility---or at least, 'net' futility---to *any* strategy seeking
to meaningfully 'unmake' security.]{.underline} While there have been a
fair number of theorists (cf. Aras & Polat, 2008; Bilgin, 2006; Kim &
Lee, 2010) who have traced instances of the desecuritization of one
issue being intrinsically tied up with---or even predicated on---the
shifting of the 'security agenda' to new threats in other sections, this
line of argument has been taken the furthest in Behnke's
post-structuralist \[2006\] argument. The key claim he makes is that the
'[**replacement' of de-securitized** issues with other, new
securitisations is not coincidental and occasional, but in fact
***inevitable*** in the context of a level-one political
'ontotheology']{.underline} \[ibid\] [that is irredeemably constituted
by the logic of security]{.underline}. Drawing on Campbell's (1998)
argument that states can only maintain ontological security, order, and
national identity in contradistinction to an excluded 'outside' (or
Other), Behnke argues that constant [(re)production of]{.underline} a
Schmittian ([securitizing) logic is a *necessary* ingredient in all
political community]{.underline} \[2006:650\], which implies that
[*meaningful* desecuritization cannot really happen]{.underline}
(Behnke, 2007:109). [We cannot, as it were, 'gain ground' against
security, as every such attempt might merely be laying the foundations
for the next security move.]{.underline} 'Replacement', while obviously
not a 'strategy of desecuritization' (indeed, if anything it is the
opposite), is nonetheless of key interest for the significant analytical
and normative implications it has. In a straightforward sense, it should
make analysts more suspicious of cases that on the surface *appear* to
be straightforward examples of successful 31 desecuritization---but
which on closer examination reveal the complex machinery of security at
work, suggesting that this 'desecuritization' in one sector might
perhaps be more accurately understood as merely the side-product of a
counter-securitisation---or even a *meta-* securitization---in another
sector (cf. Williams, 2003, 2011\]. Furthermore, 'replacement' obviously
has tremendous ramifications for the practical limits of
desecuritization---and hence for the normative limits of both the CS, as
well as that of many of its critics, as it suggests that even if
desecuritization is achievable within specific cases and contexts, [no
political sphere is- or can be completely 'de-securitized']{.underline}.
Nevertheless, even if are to concede the political irreducibility of
security, and accept that [desecuritization will at best leave state
elites with a temporary 'threat deficit problem']{.underline} \[Buzan,
2006:6\], it seems a stretch to conclude from this [that
desecuritization is entirely 'meaningless' politically.]{.underline}
Instead, as also noted by Hansen (2012:541-542), we might take this
opportunity to interrogate the differential *effects* of different forms
of 'otherness', and whether [trading in one securitisation for
another]{.underline}, even if it fails to maintain 'normal politics',
[will only involve a substantive realignment of 'threats' within a
self-same 'war logic', or whether the transfer could even be a
desirable, qualitative one, towards a more reflexive or 'stable'
securitisation.65]{.underline}

undermines democratic decision making and marginalizes subjects**

Significantly, if 'securitisation' can, in one sense, be understood as
an 'extreme version of politicization' \[Buzan, Waever & de Wilde,
1998:23\], it might be suggested that the inverse also holds---that is,
extreme versions of '[desecuritization' may effectively entail the
wholesale *de-politicization* of issues.]{.underline} This final and
arguably [most problematic form of desecuritization is found in the
phenomenon of 'silencing']{.underline} \[Floyd, 2007; Mackenzie, 2009;
Hansen, 2012\], which is when a formerly [securitised issue]{.underline}
is moved out of the 'security agenda', but rather than becoming
*politicized*, it [is *de*-politicized, vanishing from political
discourse as it is dropped below the public discursive
radar]{.underline} (Hansen, 2012:544-545). Such a process has been
demonstrated, amongst others, in Mackenzie's (2009) study of the
systematic and gendered 'exclusion' of former female soldiers from the
post-conflict reintegration programs in Sierra Leone, which effectively
"removed them from significant policy discourses' \[Mackenzie,
2009:257\]. Similarly, in her study tracing the Bush-era
'desecuritization' of environmental security, Floyd (2007:347)
identifies how certain forms 65 Say, replacing the threat of 'migrants'
with 'environment'; although such evaluations do seem implicitly to
require substantive consideration \[cf. Floyd, 2011\].

'desecuritization-as-silencing' is, of all forms of desecuritization,
the one "that stretches securitisation theory the most" \[2012:545\],
both *analytically,* in [that 'silent desecuritizations' cannot be
studied]{.underline} within a framework grounded 66 but especially
*normatively.* After all, whereas [politicizing an issue allows for more
democratic]{.underline} (and, in the CS view, more felicitous)
[decision-making, silencing actively yet covertly works as a 'strategy
of exclusion' that marginalizes and obscures 'potentially insecure
subjects' \[ibid.2012:544-545\], further disadvantaging them and denying
them any political recognition.]{.underline} Such a move should be of
obvious *tactical* interest as a 'strategic time-out' that [enables
political actors to "\...depoliticise in ways that facilitate the long
term goal of a political bargaining sphere"]{.underline} (ibid.535).
However, as it is inherently anti-democratic, and as, [by perpetuating
the insecurity of marginalized but voiceless actors, it risks laying the
foundations for future (re)- securitizations,67]{.underline}
'desecuritization-as-silencing' appears, if anything, the [ethical
*antithesis*]{.underline} of 'proper' desecuritization, whether
conceived in deontic or consequentialist terms.

The normative [goal of securitization theory is to protect 'normal
politics' though civilized illocutionary action in favor of
desecuritization]{.underline}, where [**desecuritization is constantly
understood as synonymous with 'progress attached to the development of
Western international society':**]{.underline} Progress as
desecuritization \[has been\] inherent in the liberals' project since
the nineteenth century.... This project has been taken the *furthest* in
the 'zone of peace' that now characterizes Western international
society.... With the demise of the Communist counterproject and the
closed states and societies associated with it, the prospect exists for
a more widespread dissolving of borders, desecuritizing most kinds of
political, social, and economic interaction. This development is the
*most advanced* within the EU, but it is also inherent in the shift from
modern to postmodern states and from more closed to more open political
constructions that is going on in many parts of the world. ([Buzan et
al.,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967010619862921):

dramatically misapprehend the historical record (see [Barkawi and

[In the securitization framework, the study of security is ultimately
the study of the designation of threat.]{.underline} In this framework,
an issue is a security issue if European Journal of International
Relations 14(4) 578 positioned as a threat to a particular political
community. This commitment to the study of 'threats' is based on a
commitment to the idea that security is constituted in oppositional
terms: by designating that which it is not or that from which it needs
preservation or protection (Wæver, 1995: 56). Such a commitment is
consistent also with the oppositional conception of identity in the
securitization framework, wherein who we are is determined by the
designation of (threatening) others.21 In short, we can learn all we
need to know about the construction of security through studying the
issues that are represented as existential threats. As Michael Williams
(2003) has suggested, this oppositional view of the politics of security
is related to the Copenhagen School's indebtedness to the political
theory of Carl Schmitt. For Schmitt, politics in general is
characterized by enmity and exclusion, with the sovereign's designation
of threatening 'others' central to political life and allowing the
'exception': the suspension of the normal rules of politics. For the
securitization framework, such a vision of politics is particularly
applicable to the realm of security, which is characterized by the
articulation of threat and 'emergency measures' enabled by that
articulation. The Copenhagen School suggests that this political dynamic
captures something timeless about the logic of security itself, with the
realm of security an arena of exclusion and 'panic politics' (Buzan et
al., 1998: 34). This view of the logic of security has been central to
their call for desecuritization, a point I will return to in a moment.
Representations of threat --- pivotal to Schmittian security politics
--- can of course be viewed as constitutive of security and identity. As
Simon Dalby has argued, the designation of that from which we need to be
protected is crucial in telling us 'who we are, what we value and what
we are prepared to countenance to protect our self-preferred identities'
(Dalby, 2002: xxx). But is this the only way in which security is
constructed, and what do we miss through focusing only on the
designation of threat? I suggest here that while central, [a focus on
the designation of threat alone risks missing much about the
construction of security, especially through privileging the 'content'
of security over its meaning in particular contexts.]{.underline} As
noted, Roxanne Lynn Doty (1998/9) has suggested that radically different
approaches to immigration can be understood in the context of different
discourses of security. For Doty, changing approaches to the treatment
of Haitian refugees by the US government in the 1990s can primarily ---
and contra the Copenhagen School --- be understood as a change in the
way security itself was understood. And I have suggested elsewhere
(McDonald, 2003) that significant change in the Brazilian government's
approach to Amazonian deforestation in the late 1980s --- from
conceptualizing the intact rainforest as a threat to Brazil to
positioning it as that in need of being protected as part of Brazil ---
can be better understood as a change in perceptions McDonald:
Securitization and the Construction of Security 579 or discourses of
security rather than as an instance of 'de-securitization'. Here,
articulations of the values in need of being protected were more
prominent --- and I would suggest more politically significant --- than
articulations of 'from what or whom we need protection'. The [focus on
the designation of threat alone therefore tells a partial story of how
security is given meaning, marginalizing inclusive and non-statist
definitions of 'our values' that tell us how security is understood in
particular contexts]{.underline}.22 [More problematically]{.underline},
the Copenhagen School [image of security as acquiring
meaning]{.underline} (or more accurately content) [through the
articulation of threat arguably works only to the extent that security
is fixed in a Schmittian logic based on exclusion and
exception]{.underline}.23 The 'fixedness' of the Copenhagen School's
logic of security has been taken up by 'Welsh School' critical security
theorists, for whom the study of security should be geared towards
recognizing and advancing opportunities for emancipation of the most
vulnerable. Ken Booth (2005: 207) and Paul Williams (2004: 144), for
example, have suggested that the securitization framework is parasitic
upon traditional (Realist) discourses of security that are taken as
indicative of a universal and timeless logic of security. This is
evident, for these theorists, in the Copenhagen School's commitment to
[strict boundaries of inclusion and exclusion; to the state and state
political leaders' centrality in defining (usually external) threats and
responses to them; and to the association of security means and tools
with the most significant of 'emergency measures': military
action]{.underline}. [This constitutes an important normative
problem]{.underline}, arguably [serving to reify and normalize these
traditional statist, exclusionary and militaristic approaches to
security]{.underline}. Indeed, the idea that the Copenhagen School's
logic of security is both relatively fixed and politically conservative
is a feature of even sympathetic readings of the securitization
framework (Huysmans, 1998: 500--1; Hansen, 2000: 286). In this context,
key proponents of the Copenhagen School (Wæver, 1995; 2000: 253; 2004;
Buzan et al., 1998: 204--9) have argued in favour of desecuritization:
the removal of issues from the security agenda. While recognizing the
possibility for securitization to be progressive (eg Wæver, 2000: 285),
the general suggestion is that 'it is better . . . to [aim for
desecuritization']{.underline} (Buzan and Wæver, 1998: 4). Here, the
Schmittian logic of security can be avoided and issues returned to the
open and deliberative realm of normal politics. [Important issues
surface again here about what constitutes normal politics and about the
relatively simplistic distinction between 'security' and
'politics']{.underline}. Analytically, it is certainly possible to
suggest that rather than constituting the opposite realm to that of
politics, debates around what constitutes security and how 'we' should
act to achieve or preserve it are particularly politically intense, even
a form of 'hyper-politics'. The logic of security upon which the
securitization framework is based might be contested again here, 579
European Journal of International Relations 14(4) 580 most prominently
the suggestion that security 'speech acts' can themselves take issues
outside the political realm. But the [suggestion that we should aim for
'desecuritization' is also normatively problematic. It **depicts
security as a failure of 'normal politics' rather than recognizing
security as a site of contestation and therefore for** (even
emancipatory) **change**]{.underline}. [This is especially important if
security is still that most powerful of political categories ---
defining political priority, a community's identity and its core values.
The focus only on the negative designation of threat **serves the
interests of those who benefit from dominant negative and exclusionary
articulations of threat in contemporary international politics**,
further **silencing voices articulating alternative visions for what
security means and how it might be realized.**]{.underline}

Whatever the outcome[, many observers believe the war will have a
[profound effect on the broader condition of world
politics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/04/war-ukraine-turning-point-history/).
They see the war in Ukraine as a watershed moment: a giant fork in the
road. If Russia loses big, the "liberal world order" will get a new
lease on life and the forces of autocracy will suffer a setback. If
Putin ekes out some sort of win, however, they foresee a [dark slide
toward the totalitarian
abyss](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-01/francis-fukuyama-liberalism-country)]{.underline}.
Existing norms against the acquisition of territory by force will be
eroded, and other autocrats will presumably be empowered to launch
similar campaigns whenever the geopolitical stars align in their favor.
I see it differently. The [war in Ukraine **is** a significant event,
but **not because the outcome will have a dramatic independent effect on
the global balance of power or the normative environment that states
have constructed**]{.underline} (and sometimes adhere to). Rather, it is
important because [it signals the end of the brief "unipolar
moment"]{.underline} (1993-2020) when the United States was the world's
sole genuine superpower and [because it heralds a return to patterns of
world politics that were temporarily suppressed during the short era of
unchallenged U.S. primacy.]{.underline} The end of that era was in sight
long before Russia invaded Ukraine, however, and the war itself is more
of a punctuation mark. (For a similar take, see Stephen Kotkin
[here](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-06/cold-war-never-ended-russia-ukraine-war).)
I am less inclined to see the war in Ukraine as a transformative moment
because I've heard that song too many times in recent decades. [We were
told that "everything had changed" when the Berlin Wall came down, the
Soviet Union imploded, and the Warsaw Pact dissolved.]{.underline} A new
world order was at hand, the "[cynical calculus of pure power politics
simply \[did\] not
compute](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/02/us/the-1992-campaign-excerpts-from-speech-by-clinton-on-us-role.html),"
mankind had supposedly reached the "[end of
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man),"
and liberal capitalist democracy (preferably the American version) was
now the only game in town. But then ["everything changed" again on Sept.
11, 2001, and we were suddenly in a "global war on terror,"]{.underline}
which some [overwrought
analysts](https://www.amazon.com/World-War-IV-Struggle-Islamofascism/dp/0307386023)
tried to repackage as "[World War
IV](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1006219259392114120)." But hold on!
"[Everything changed" yet again when financial markets collapsed in 2008
and Wall Street's "masters of the universe" were revealed to be
gullible, fallible, and corrupt. And then "everything changed" once more
when Donald Trump became president and began trampling every norm in the
U.S. political playbook.]{.underline} So forgive me if I have trouble
seeing the war in Ukraine as a decisive turning point in the history of
humanity. For all the damage and suffering that have already occurred,
it has a long way to go before it reaches the levels of destruction
wrought by the wars in Indochina, between Iran and Iraq, or in [central
Africa](https://www.amazon.com/Africas-World-War-Continental-Catastrophe/dp/0199754209)---or
by the [U.S. campaigns in Iraq and
Afghanistan](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/summary). The
war could still get there, of course---especially if weapons of mass
destruction are used---but the odds are against it (a prediction that I
fervently hope turns out to be correct). More importantly, what is
different about the current war is that for the first time since the
early 1990s---but hardly the first time in history---there are rival
great powers on the opposite sides of a major war. But this is a
reversion to familiar patterns of great-power conflicts (and proxy wars)
and not something novel or unique. As suggested above, this war is more
accurately seen as marking the official end of the brief quasi-peace
that followed the end of the Cold War. War didn't disappear in that
period---the United States fought in a bunch of them and started
several---but the conflicts during this period were either civil wars,
wars between minor powers, gross mismatches between major powers and
minor powers, or some combination of all three. Direct great-power
competition was muted because neither Russia nor China was strong enough
to openly resist the United States. Dartmouth College political
scientist William Wohlforth was partly right when he wrote of the
"[stability of a unipolar world](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539346)":
Few countries wanted to face the "focused enmity" of the United States
or take actions that might bring the United States into the game in
opposition. Where Wohlforth erred was his prediction that unipolarity
might last even longer than Cold War bipolarity. That misjudgment was
not entirely his fault, however, as he could not have foreseen the
repeated blunders that hastened the end of the unipolar era. U.S.
primacy and unipolar stability would have lasted longer if U.S.
policymakers had been smarter, less ideologically driven, and more
realistic (in every sense of that term). If Ukraine retains all or most
of its former territory, it will be because of the hard power its
citizens employed (with lots of outside help) to stop its larger
neighbor. Instead of preserving U.S. power, resolving conflicts wherever
possible, and working to ensure that no peer competitor emerged, U.S.
officials mostly did the exact opposite. They [helped China rise more
rapidly](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-10-19/inevitable-rivalry-cold-war)
and squandered trillions of dollars in [costly and misguided crusades in
the greater Middle
East](https://www.amazon.com/Americas-War-Greater-Middle-East-ebook/dp/B0174PRIY4).
Instead of extending liberal institutions gradually through mechanisms
such as the Partnership for Peace, they expanded NATO with scant regard
for Russian concerns and blithely assumed that Moscow could or would do
nothing to stop it. Instead of taking a more measured approach to
globalization and making sure its benefits were widely shared inside the
United States, they embraced neoliberal approaches to global trade and
investment and did not do enough to insulate endangered sectors of the
U.S. workforce from globalization's consequences. And instead of working
overtime to make American democracy a model that other societies might
want to emulate, U.S. politicians---and here I refer primarily to the
Republican Party---repeatedly trampled on the principles and norms that
are essential for true democracy to survive. The unipolar moment was
never going to last forever, but repeated sins of omission and
commission---for which no one was ever held accountable---brought it to
a premature end. [So where will this leave us?]{.underline} In the
immortal words of Talking Heads: "[[Same as it ever was, same as it ever
was](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=104)."]{.underline} First, [it is a
world where hard power still matters]{.underline}, as everyone has now
been reminded. If Russia succeeds in incorporating the Donetsk and
Luhansk oblasts and a land bridge to Crimea, it will be because its
military forces were able to accomplish that mission despite their
earlier miscalculations and missteps. If Ukraine retains all or most of
its former territory, it will be because of the hard power its citizens
employed (with lots of outside help) to stop its larger neighbor. If the
much ballyhooed "norm against conquest" gets reinforced, it will not be
because Putin suddenly remembered that norms ought to be followed but
because the combination of Ukrainian nationalism and effective weaponry
proved too much for Moscow to overcome. Second, the world has been
reminded---again!---that economic interdependence is not without risks
and trade-offs. Markets surely matter, but politics matter more.
Connecting the world through trade, investment, complex supply chains,
and gas pipelines brought obvious and enormous benefits, but tight
economic links are not an ironclad barrier to conflict and being
dependent on others can cause real pain if those ties get sundered,
whether by a dangerous virus or a sudden geopolitical fissure. Looking
ahead, most states and most firms are going to sacrifice some amount of
economic efficiency for the sake of redundancy and resilience. Economic
growth will be lower than it might have been otherwise, but disruptive
shocks will occur less often and states and firms will be less
vulnerable to economic pressure. When forced to choose between security
and profits, most countries will choose the former. Third, even if
Russia achieves some limited gains in the Donbass, the war will
accelerate its relative decline. Putin may prevent Ukraine from ever
joining NATO, but the long-term consequences of that achievement will
leave Russia worse off as a whole. Unless he erects a new Iron Curtain,
[talented young Russians will continue to
leave](https://nationalpost.com/news/under-putin-russia-seeing-an-exodus-of-the-most-educated-most-active-most-entrepreneurial-people).
State revenues will decline as more and more countries wean themselves
off Russian oil, gas, and coal. Ukraine will continue to move toward
Europe economically, a [process that was already
underway](https://vis.csh.ac.at/12-facts-ukraine-rus-eu/) before the war
began. If Putin does achieve "victory" in Ukraine---which is by no means
certain---it will be a Pyrrhic one. Russia's autocracy may be more
secure but less consequential. The world of the future will be closer to
true bipolarity than lopsided multipolarity, with Russia playing the
role of China's junior partner (and one whose economic vitality and
long-term strategic value may be diminishing). It won't help Beijing's
image to be closely linked to Russia's destruction of Ukraine, and
Moscow could need more propping up as Russia's economy falters and its
population ages and shrinks. The emerging future will be neither a
U.S.-centered "liberal order" nor a Chinese-centered autocratic one.
Instead, [each of these two major powers will lead partial
orders](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/43/4/7/12221/Bound-to-Fail-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Liberal)
that incorporate states that either share similar values or have little
choice but to align with one side or the other. And make no mistake:
Both Washington and Beijing are going to expect a lot of loyalty from
some of their allies. Expect to see greater division and contention in
the digital space as the two countries compete to determine which
technical standards will predominate and as the digital world gradually
segments behind firewalls, safeguards, incompatible privacy standards,
and other restrictions. [**We are back in a world that realism explains
best, one where great powers compete for power and influence and others
adapt as best they can.**]{.underline} But as the [global response to
Ukraine
suggests](https://twitter.com/kaa_richter/status/1511687026319503364),
many countries---especially those in the global south---will resist
pressures to pick a side and will try to remain aloof from quarrels that
do not involve them directly. Some of them will try to extract greater
benefits by playing the United States and China off against each other.
Among other things, this situation is a reminder that trying to base
U.S. foreign policy on a rigid dichotomy of "[democracy vs.
autocracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/autocracy-could-destroy-democracy-russia-ukraine/629363/)"
is a [recipe for
failure](https://twitter.com/MMazarr/status/1509643245013377027). As in
the past, success will require cooperating with like-minded partners
where possible and with states that do not share U.S. values when
necessary. Unfortunately, cooperation among the major powers is going to
be a lot harder to achieve and sustain, even when their interests are
partly aligned. This could be the most significant fallout from this
nasty but thus far localized war: It gives major powers the excuse to
ignore the less imminent but far more ominous danger of [accelerating
climate
change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/).
Dealing with climate change is going to require sacrifices by all the
major powers, but they will be less willing to make them when they are
worried about the global balance of power and are reluctant to give up
more than their rivals. We are back in a world that realism explains
best, one where great powers compete for power and influence and others
adapt as best they can. [The jungle isn't "growing back,"]{.underline}
as [Robert Kagan would have us
believe](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576193/the-jungle-grows-back-by-robert-kagan/);
[it never really went away, even when the United States was the biggest
beast and deluded itself into thinking it could make all the other
animals behave]{.underline}. That's not a particularly happy thought,
but [the world that realism depicts is not a particularly happy
world.]{.underline}
