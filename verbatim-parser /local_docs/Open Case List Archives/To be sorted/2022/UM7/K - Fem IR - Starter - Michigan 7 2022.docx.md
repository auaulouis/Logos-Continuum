    national defense / security...

  - Turns case b/c it makes wars more likely

  - Chivalric protectionism solidifies unethical gendered hierarchies

- Alt: To embrace vulnerability

#### 1. The AFF attempt to securitize against geopolitical vulnerabilities produces more violence than it prevents -- their politics of chivalric impact avoidance constitutes a "protection racket" that justifies the intensification of militarization

> Conclusion
>
> One of the conclusions of the offense-defense literature is that
> states perceive themselves to be much more insecure than they really
> are. Van Evera writes, \"[[The prime threat to the security of modern
> great powers is \... themselves. Their greatest menace lies in their
> own tendency to exaggerate the dangers they face, and to respond with
> counterproductive belligerence." While states have been more or less
> been secure]{.mark}, these [feelings of insecurity have led to great
> insecurity for people worldwide]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tens to hundreds
> of millions of people were killed in wars in the twentieth century
> alone, to say nothing of those who were injured, lost loved ones, or
> had their lives disrupted by war.
>
> Van Evera goes on to write, \"The causes of this syndrome pose a large
> question for students of international relations.\" Feminists have
> much to offer in regard to this question. Focusing on how gender
> discourses and gender identities provide a necessary condition under
> which many of the factors of the offense-defense balance can thrive,
> [feminists offer a way to think about many of the issues related to

> feminist analysis can contribute to both defensive realists who
> consider wars to begin because of the perceptions of the
> offense-defense balance, as well as scholars who support the offensive

> [making offensive wars appear to be legitimately
> \"defensive]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} As Snyder argues, \"[[The belief

#### 2. In proposing FIAT as a solution to vulnerability, the aff bestows authority in the USFG as the masculine protector of "its own" and "other" feminized subjects. This discourse locks gendered and racialized hierarchies into their model of IR.

> A feminist deconstruction of arms control: In the second section of

> system achieved through "balance of power"]{.mark}]{.underline}
> exerted through diplomacy and arms control or if necessary through
> war. In each framework, [arms control was depicted merely as an
> adjunct to the military machinery of deterrence and war.]{.underline}
> A further fundamental concept used by Bull and Schelling is that of
> power in the voluntarist sense of "power over," achieved primarily by
> force or through threat of force. [The basic assumption
> in]{.underline} both views of [[arms control is that military power

### Environment Link

#### Crisis-based environmental threat construction is incompatible with the alternative

>
> The environmental conflict perspective is the approach that most
> clearly links traditional -security concerns to the environment.
> [[Most authors]{.mark} who examine environmental conflict [focus
> on]{.mark} the possibility that [groups within society will engage in
> violent conflict as natural resource stocks diminish]{.mark} due to
> environmental degradation.]{.underline} These conflicts are understood
> to threaten the stability of the state. There are several broad trends
> that are identified as increasing the likelihood of environmentally
> induced conflicts, \"including: expanding and migrating human
> populations; water, arable land and other resource and environmental
> scarcities; \... globalisation which brings people (and disease) into
> closer proximity; and increasing recognition of the injustice of
> Northern-induced underdevelopment of the South.\"6 Central to these
> discussions is the concept of scarcity. Thomas Homer-Dixon identifies
> resource scarcities as being potentially so severe that they can
> seriously undermine human well-being. He identifies three types of
> scarcities: supply-induced scarcity, demand-induced scarcity, and
> structural scarcity. 7 The main argument is that some types of
> scarcity, coupled with other factors, can contribute to violent
> conflict. 8 Given the similarities between the environmental conflict
> approach and \"mainstream\" security, a number of feminist criticisms
> of the environmental conflict approach can be read into the core
> feminist work in Security Studies. Specifically, [[feminist
> theories]{.mark} would [criticize]{.mark}]{.underline} the
> environmental conflict approach\'s narrow definition of security, its
> state-centrism, its focus on scarcity, and its [[neglect of gender as
> a]{.mark} possible [cause for environmental
> conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [feminists argue that [the
> environmental conflict]{.mark} approach [holds an inadequate]{.mark}
> [understanding of what security is]{.mark}. Environmental conflict
> scholars are focused on the potential for environmental degradation
> and scarcity to cause violent conflict, rather than looking at what
> happens to people and their environment during wars. [To term
> something a \"security\" issue and]{.mark} then to [leave]{.mark}
> important [elements of insecurity untouched is problematic]{.mark}.
> Including gender means including the assessment of potential
> insecurities during wartime as well,]{.underline} given that women
> often face particular security risks during times of conflict. A
> second problematic element of the environmental conflict literature
> from a gendered perspective is its state-centrism. Feminists often
> engage in a multilevel analysis, with particular attention paid to
> individuals and groups within societies. [[Environmental conflict
> scholar]{.mark}s typically [restrict]{.mark} their [attention]{.mark}
> [to the level of the state]{.mark}, again demonstrating the close
> links between this approach and traditional Security
> Studies.]{.underline} 11 [[Feminists contend that it is necessary to
> pay attention to security at levels]{.mark} [above and below the state
> in order to understand how women]{.mark} participate in and [are
> affected by international security]{.mark} issues.]{.underline} Third,
> ecofeminists will take issue with the assertion of a link between
> environmental conflict and scarcity because they see that treatments
> of scarcity in this literature are largely anthropocentric, suggesting
> that the environment is made up of resources for human consumption.
> Authors like Carolyn Merchant call for the acknowledgement of a
> dynamic relationship between human and nonhuman nature, with each
> having a, degree of power over the other. 12 To use terms like
> \"scarcity\" implies that the environment is something of a stockroom
> of resources for humans that may become depleted, which disregards the
> deeper relationship between the two entities. Finally, feminists, in
> their concern for the gender-differential impacts of proposed cases of
> conflict are themselves gendered. The factors often put forward as
> potentially contributing to resource scarcity and conflict in
> environmental conflict literatures include population growth, human
> migration, globalization, and unequal resource distribution. Each of
> these topics has particular implications for gender analysis that are
> largely unaddressed within this literature. For example, environmental
> conflict scholars argue that increases in human populations can
> directly contribute to both supply-induced and demand-induced
> scarcities, which could result in violent conflict. This tells us very
> little if we do not consider where these populations are located and
> who they are made up of. Also, the issue of population has specific
> gendered implications. Impacts may be different if populations have
> "youth bulges" typically made up of young males. This group
> disproportionately engages in crime, commits suicide, or join
> militias, all of which are important security concerns. Additionally,
> by identifying populations increase as a contributor to environment
> conflict, these authors are automatically making women the potential
> target of "solutions" because of their role as child bearers. When
> issues are securitized, certain actions are seen as justifiable -- and
> it is likely that men and women will experience these actions
> differently. Similar arguments can be made for a number of the other
> causal factors privileged in the environmental conflict approach.

> that Du Bois did have access to what we now call Black feminist
> analyses that view Black women\'s experiences as honed at the
> intersection of race, class, nation, and gender but that he rejected

# IMPACTS

### 2NC/1NR Impact Ext -- Protection Racket

#### Protection Racket outweighs and turns the Aff: Their framework of employing NATO and the USFG to secure against existential threats ensures catastrophic impacts and ongoing structural violence. Extend Peet and Sjoberg 2020 -- Masculine protection requires the constant evolution of militarization. The impact outweighs on magnitude because militarism accounts for so much structural violence it constitutes ongoing war. Wars become self-fulfilling because capabilities are built to fight wars, turning the case. And these discourses and policies lock in gendered hierarchies that make gender violence impossible to solve.

#### **Structural Patriarchy and the Protection Racket** 

#### **Impact -- Structural Patriarchy guarantees war -- we must refuse to buy into Hegemonic Masculinity and the Protection Racket, because it will always find a threat to justify enlarging and improving the military industrial complex**

### Impact -- Gendered Hierarchies

leads to serial policy failure and exclusion from society and politics**

### Impact - Queer Necropolitics

#### Structural patriarchy is a form of necropolitical management which is genocidal of queer, feminine, and minority bodies

> London at Birkbeck, 8-4-13, "Queer Necropolitics and the Expanding

>
> Necropolitics of Imprisonment Each of the above examples involves the
> direct or indirect mobilisation of discursive, financial or
> labour-related resources towards state practices of imprisonment and
> punishment. Given the ongoing colonial legacies of the carceral state,
> the disproportionate number of people of colour in prison and the
> widespread abuses within carceral institutions, these queer
> investments in punishment are, by their very nature, investments in
> state racism and violence. In this way, such investments are
> symptomatic of what Jasbir Puar, drawing from Achilles Mbembe's work,
> describes as queer necropolitics. [[Necropolitics]{.mark} can be
> understood [as]{.mark} technologies of [power]{.mark} that
> [(re)produce]{.mark} social [relations of living and
> dying]{.mark}]{.underline}, such that [[some]{.mark} populations [are
> ushered into]{.mark} the [worlds of life and vitality]{.mark}, while
> [others are]{.mark} [funnelled into]{.mark}]{.underline} what Mbembe
> calls [[death-worlds]{.mark}---worlds [of slow living death]{.mark},
> and dead living]{.underline} (Mbembe 2003). [[Death here
> includes]{.underline}]{.mark} literal [[physical]{.underline}]{.mark}
> death, but also [[social, political and civil
> death]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the social relations of death, decay and
> dying that emerge from prolonged exposure to violence, neglect,
> deprivation and suffering]{.underline}. Offering a corrective to
> Michel Foucault's work on biopolitics, Mbembe puts forward the notion
> of necropolitics and necropower to account for the various ways in
> which, in our contemporary world, weapons are deployed in the interest
> of the maximum destruction of persons and the creation of
> death-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast
> populations are subjected to conditions of life conferring up on them
> the status of living dead (2003, p. 40). In other words, while
> biopolitical powers work to manage, order and foster life for citizens
> worthy of protection, such powers work in tandem with [[necropolitical
> powers]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[produce death for those destined to
> abandonment, violence and neglect]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taking up this
> concept within contemporary queer politics, Puar draws attention to
> the ways in which the folding into life of some queers is predicated
> on the folding out of life of others (Puar 2007, p. 36). On one level,
> as Braidotti (2007) notes, 'Bio-power and necro-politics are two sides
> of the same coin'; the relationship between the governance of life and
> death cannot be separated. Indeed, Foucault notes the inherent tension
> within the classical theory of sovereignty in the right of power over
> life and death. Because the sovereign has no capacity to create life,
> the 'right of life and death is always exercised in an unbalanced way:
> the balance is always tipped in favour of death' (Foucault 1976/2003,
> p. 240). Hence [the 'very essence of [the right of life]{.mark} and
> death [is actually the right to kill]{.mark}; it is at [the moment
> when the sovereign can kill]{.mark} that [he exercises his right over
> life']{.mark}]{.underline} (Foucault 1976/2003, p. 240). Yet the
> emergence of biopower, argues Foucault, marks a shift in this balance,
> [from the right to take life or let live, to [the power to make live
> and let die]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biopower intervenes in the
> conditions of life at the level of populations to improve, prolong,
> extend living; it is a technique of governance aimed at maximising,
> optimising and fostering life.25 Yet the tension between the exercise
> of power over life and death remains. For if biopower seeks to
> maximise life, what justifies its continued exercise of death? It is
> here, Foucault argues, [that [racism intervenes, as 'the precondition
> that makes killing acceptable']{.mark}]{.underline} (1976/2003, p.
> 256). For [[the imperative to kill is acceptable only if it
> results]{.mark} not in a victory over political adversaries, but [in
> the elimination of the]{.mark} biological [threat]{.mark} to and the
> improvement of the species or race]{.underline}...Once the State
> functions in biopower mode, [racism alone can justify the murderous
> function of the State]{.underline} (Foucault 1976/2003, p. 256).
> [[Racism is therefore]{.mark} not an aberration within the exercise of
> biopower, but [a key premise in determining which populations will be
> made to live and left to die]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taking this
> analysis further, Mbembe asks whether biopolitics can fully account
> for specific conditions, processes and techniques in which
> contemporary forms of life are subjugated by the power of death: Is
> the notion of biopower sufficient to account for the contemporary ways
> in which the political, under the guise of war, of resistance, or of
> the fight against terror, makes the murder of the enemy its primary
> and absolute objective?... [What place is given to life, death and the
> human body]{.underline} (in particular the wounded or slain body)? How
> are they inscribed in the order of power?' (Mbembe 2003, p. 12).
> Mapping out the ways in which [the [politics of death are]{.mark}
> [central to contemporary]{.mark} modes of [governance]{.mark} and
> warfare]{.underline}, Mbembe suggests the creation of deathwords is
> not merely a by-product of biopower, but a primary aim of its
> counterpart, necropower. Indeed, [the [administering]{.mark} of [life
> is]{.mark} increasingly [contingent upon]{.mark}, and supplemented by,
> [new forms of sovereign power]{.mark} that are [deployed in the
> administration of]{.mark} mass [death]{.mark} and
> destruction]{.underline}.While Mbembe's analysis focuses primarily on
> situations of military occupation, colonialism and war, [the modern
> prison arguably constitutes another key instantiation of necropower.
> For the prison is a site that produces the conditions of living
> death]{.underline}; it is a place [where bodies are subject to regimes
> of slow death and dying]{.underline}. Not only are deprivation, abuse
> and neglect regular features of incarceration but [[the monotonous
> regime of caged life]{.underline}]{.mark}---the experience of 'doing
> time'---[[involves]{.mark} the [slow wearing away of human vitality
> and]{.mark} the [reduction of human experience to a bleak
> existence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Scraton and McQulloch 2009; Taylor
> 2000). This is especially true within regimes of solitary confinement,
> particularly in 'supermax' or 'special housing units' in the USA where

> exercise in pens the size of dog cages, subjected to windowless cells
> and deprived of virtually any human contact---not only for days, but
> for years---with devastating mental health consequences (Haney 2003).
> In these ways, [the prison serves as a site of mass warehousing of
> bodies in conditions that often resemble the death-worlds]{.underline}
> that Mbembe describes. While [the]{.underline} modern [prison was
> designed as an institution which aimed in part to train prisoners as
> productive workers, obedient citizens and docile
> subjects]{.underline}---a strategy that used disciplinary power in the
> broader service of biopolitical power (Foucault
> 1978/1995)---[contemporary prisons are little more than mass
> warehouses for poor, racialised and otherwise disenfranchised
> populations]{.underline} (Gilmore 2007). As prison populations
> continue to grow to unprecedented levels, many [states are abandoning
> even the pretence of rehabilitation,]{.underline} by dramatically
> reducing the hours that prisoners spend out of their cells, slashing
> funding for educational and other programmes and increasingly leaving
> prisoners to spend their days in monotonous isolation. [These
> conditions]{.underline}, coupled with overcrowding, lack of adequate
> medical care and disconnection from family and friends, [mean that
> prisoners experience high risks of self-harm, psychological abuse,
> trauma and suicide, both during imprisonment and
> post-release]{.underline} (Collins 2008; Taylor 2000; Kupers 2006). A
> criminal record also means that employment and housing are difficult
> to secure postrelease, family and community relationships are
> difficult to re-establish, and problems of poverty, mental illness and
> addiction persist---such that the consequences of imprisonment extend
> well beyond the duration of one's sentence. [The added combination of
> intensive surveillance and disciplinary probation regimes on the one
> hand, and limited post-release supports on the other, also mean that a
> high portion of prisoners experience repeated cycles of capture and
> release in the 'revolving door' of imprisonment]{.underline}. [The
> prison thus plays a significant role in]{.underline} [altering the
> 'distribution of life chances']{.underline} or [what
> Gilmore]{.underline} (2007, p. 247) [describes as 'group
> differentiated vulnerability to premature death']{.underline}. In one
> sense, the after-effects of imprisonment can be understood as
> unfortunate but inevitable 'challenges' that prisoners face in
> recuperating from their sentences. But on another level, [these
> '[collateral consequences' constitute]{.mark} a form of [legally
> sanctioned social abandonment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because
> ex-prisoners can be legally discriminated against with respect to
> housing, employment, education, jury duty, volunteer service and
> social assistance access, a criminal conviction becomes a 'negative
> credential' that functions as [[a 'unique mechanism of state-sponsored
> stratification']{.underline}]{.mark} (Alexander 2010, p. 148). Voting
> restrictions---including the disenfranchisement of prisoners while
> serving sentences in Britain, and [the permanent disenfranchisement of
> felons in some US states---marks another mode of exclusion from the
> polis]{.underline} (Manza and Uggen 2006). But perhaps more
> importantly, th[e social stigma and shame of a criminal conviction
> casts a long shadow on the future prospects of the
> (ex)prisoner]{.underline}. [Marked as permanently failed, perpetually
> dangerous, and always suspicious, prisoners]{.underline} do not simply

> thus becomes one of the most powerful ways that working class, black,
> migrant, disabled and other over-criminalised populations, are legally
> subjected to social, civil, and political death]{.underline}. To argue
> that [the prison is an institution of necropolitical]{.underline}
> [power and that prisoners are resigned to slow death, is not to deny

> death, thus severely restricting the possibilities for resistance and
> survival. Ironically, and perhaps most devastatingly, [it is through
> the act of potentially reclaiming death that prisoners exercise a
> desperate form of agency]{.underline}. As Mbembe argues, in the realms
> of the living dead, [death offers a brutal moment of
> power]{.underline}. 'For death is precisely that from and over which I
> have power. But it is also that space where freedom and negation
> operate' (Mbembe 2003, p. 39). Hence it should be no surprise that the

> prison. As the recent prisoner hunger strikes in California, Italy,

# ALTERNATIVE

### 2NC/1NR Alt Ext -- Vulnerability 

#### **Our alternative is to embrace vulnerability. Extend Väyrynen, 2019** **-- it is preferable to accept the vulnerability that is ontological to our existence, instead of hyperbolizing and securitizing against every potential threat. Our link and impacts prove that empirically, securitization against threats backfires and accelerates the probability and magnitude of those threats: countries with lax gun laws have more gun violence; countries that race for nuclear weapons are the only countries who have used them... and in the case of the AFF, countries that join NATO sign onto a specific security agenda based in Western Deterrence vs. Eastern Aggression and continued Northern Control of Southern Others. The aff does not passively fit into this scheme -- it suggests NATO and USFG military-industrial evolution to adapt to international threats. Instead of committing to that paternalistic ordering scheme, the neg asks you to align yourself with a mutually exclusive feminist peace theory, which rejects the protection racket and its hierarchies. When the AFF framework does not reduce vulnerability and magnifies risk -- it is try or die for a new model of achieving peace.**

#### **Embrace the 1% risk -- vulnerability is an inevitable component of life -- securitizing against it doesn't solve and backfires**

## AT: PERM

#### If we win a link then they can't access the alternative -- the problem/solution framework afforded by patriarchal ordering schemes, and specifically chivalric masculinity, are mutually exclusive with the alternative's embrace of vulnerability. Our alternative refuses both the narrative of the 1AC and the hypothetical FIATed outcome, because it feeds into and strengthens the protection racket. The alternative solves the terminal and root cause impacts better, so there is only a risk that including the 1AC will foreclose alt solvency.

## UTIL

### Util Turn

#### Util permits unethical acts in the name of the lesser-evil. This political model creates a constant state of exception which justifies necropolitics (this is a DA to the perm as well)

# AT: STUFF

## AT: FEM IR TURNS

### AT: K = Essentialism

#### No link and turn -- we don't assume men are inherently more aggressive than women -- the military creates this essentialism to serve its interests. We critique discourses that sustain notions of masculinity intrinsically tied to violence 

**Wilcox, 2010** (Lauren Wilcox, Lecturer in Gender Studies and the
Deputy Director of the Centre for Gender Studies at the University of
Cambridge, whose work is located at the intersections of international
relations, political theory, and feminist theory in investigating the
consequences of thinking about bodies and embodiment in the study of
international practices of violence and security. "Gendering the Cult of
the Offensive," in Gender and International Security edited by Laura
Sjoberg, p. 69 (SPP).

[[Some scholars have argued that men are more likely to make war than
women, because men are naturally aggressive]{.underline}.]{.mark} Wars
break out because men are in positions of political and military power.
Francis Fukuyama\'s 1998 Foreign Affairs article is an example of this
type of reasoning. If this logic were true, it could be argued that men
are likely to misinterpret the actual offense-defense balance because
their aggressive tendencies inspire them to seek out conflict. [[The
relationship between gender and aggression, however, is more
complicated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Claims of \"natural\" aggression in
men are politically suspect because they imply it is impossible for men
to be otherwise, and therefore ignore the many men who do not behave
aggressively. Joshua Goldstein finds little evidence that increased
levels of testosterone in men fuel wars, or that biological factors
explain the near-monopoly men have had on war-fighting throughout
history[. [Instead of blaming men\'s biological composition for state
aggressiveness, feminists in IR have identified military training and
the installment of martial values]{.mark} in men [as a source of
aggressive policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cynthia [[Enloe draws
attention to the myriad strategies associating nationalism and
masculinity that military recruiters have used around the world and
through time to encourage men to enlist, from promises of a fast-track
to \"first-class citizenship\" for racial minorities, to presumptions of
cultural superiority for groups already privileged]{.mark}. In the case
of World War I, a \"crisis of masculinity\" in Britain was incited by
the physical ineligibility of much of the working classes for military
service, resulting in widespread government intervention to produce a
nation of men more suited for the rigors of war deemed necessary to
maintain Britain\'s colonial empire and place in the world. Anxieties
over the ability of men to defend the nation prompted attempts to
reshape gender relations throughout society to encourage the
reinvigoration of traditional gender roles. [This evidence indicates
that rather than being inherently masculine, the military serves as an
important site for the creation and maintenance of gender identities in
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Enloe points out, \"If maleness,
masculinity, and militarism were inevitably bound together, militaries
would always have all the soldiers they believed they required.\"42
Viewing gender as an identity, as \"a socially imposed and internalized
lens through which individuals perceive and respond to the world,\"43
does a better job at explaining the underestimation of the costs of war
than theories of men\'s innate aggression.

### AT: K = Gender Binaries

#### Our theory of hegemonic masculinity does not rely on binaries but recognizes that a constructed conception of masculinity is privileged over other masculinities and femininities

**Wadley, 2010.** (Jonathan, PhD in IR from Florida and currently
professor of IR and sexual politics at San Diego. "Gendering the State:
Performativity and Protection in International Security," in *Gender and
International Security* edited by Laura Sjoberg, pp. 49-50, SPP)

Often, [[the qualities of gender norms are structured as dichotomous
pairs]{.underline}]{.mark}. As signifiers of identity, they establish
hierarchy among the actors upon which they are \"written.\" They
include, among other things: rationality/irrationality,
civilized/barbaric, autonomous/dependent, active/passive, and
powerful/weak-all of which map onto the dominant signifier pair of
masculine/feminine[. [The examination of gender dichotomies such as
these has been helpful in accounting for how unequal, relational
identities have been maintained and how they have privileged some actors
and marginalized other]{.mark}s]{.underline}. However, there are limits
to this kind of analysis[. By viewing relational gender identities in
dichotomous terms, one risks neglecting the variation that exists within
those categories]{.underline}. Simply put, there are different and
unequal types of masculinity and femininity. Within the range of
masculinities, there are dominant and subordinate types. [[A hegemonic
masculinity is an idealized, relational, and historical model of
masculinity-one to which other forms of masculinity are
subordinate.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although the qualities associated with
it characterize a small percentage of masculine actors, [[its
idealization and cultural pervasiveness require other actors to position
themselves in relation to it]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while it is
continually evolving, incorporating other forms of masculinity even as
it subordinates them, it remains identifiable. [[By performing in
accordance with a dominant model of masculinity, states can
constitute]{.underline}]{.mark} (and thus, position) [[themselves
relationally as powerful subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Connell,
[this kind of positioning is at the heart of the concept of
[masculinity,]{.mark} to such a degree that the term \"[represents not a
certain type of man but, rather, a way that men position themselves
through discursive practices]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\" Cynthia
Enloe argues similarly that patriarchy is perpetuated by "men who are
recognized and claim a certain form of masculinity, for the sake of
being more valued, more \'serious,\' and \'the protectors of/and
controllers of those people who are less masculine." A comparable
process occurs among states[. [As with men, the more that states are
able to constitute themselves in alliance with the norms of the
hegemonic masculinity the more they will improve their position and
boost their credibility. Thus, states have constant incentives to
perform in ways that not only are masculine but that constitute them as
a certain form of]{.mark} masculine [actor]{.mark}, one [who embodies
the elements of the hegemonic masculinity]{.mark}. Performances that
masculinize states by positioning them closer to the ideal of the
hegemonic masculinity are likely to be most effective in the realm of
security. This is because security performances are central to the
production of the state as a unitary subject and because, so often,
security performances are rendered intelligible by highly pronounced
ideas about masculinity and femininity. War, in particular, demonstrates
this claim]{.underline}. Long ago, Kenneth Waltz observed that in times
of war the state is united (and, therefore, a single entity) to a
greater degree than at any other time. Tickner makes a similar
observation but concludes that gender plays a big role in producing
state unity: [the state becomes a citizen-warrior in times of
war.]{.underline} Jean Bethke Elshtain and Susan Jeffords go one step
further, arguing that [collective identities are constructed through the
types of men and women that war creates or brings out.]{.underline} But
absent war, security performances are still crucial for state production
and reproduction. By taking dangers, threats, and other signs of
insecurity to be there objects, [security performances reproduce the
boundaries between a secure self and a dangerous other. Boundary
reproduction is central to processes of statecraft, and security
performances occur where the integrity of the state\'s boundaries are
discursively challenged]{.underline}, often in an explicit manner.
Whether such threats are internal or external, the effect is the same.
Indeed, the distinction often collapses. One effect of successful
security performances, then, is the appearance of the state as a
unitary, continuous actor, and one who can claim legitimacy over those
\"internal\" to it. An additional effect of successful security
performances is the constitution of the state as an actor who is
hierarchically dominant to certain other international actors,
frequently states. Both of these can be accomplished by performing
security in accord with the norms of the hegemonic masculinity. [The
relational quality of gender ensures that any performances that gave the
state the appearance of personhood will necessarily position its
personhood in relation to other states. [Any gendered construction of
the state, even if it does not live up to masculine ideals, will be
\"socially defined contradistinction from some
model]{.mark}]{.underline} (whether real or imaginary) [[of femininity;
thus, the gender norms that make a state intelligible as a subject also
situate it relationally to other actors.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Masculinity and femininity are culturally constructed -- masculine doesn't inherently dominate the feminine

**Workman 96** (Thom, Poli Sci @ U of New Brunswick, YCISS Paper no. 31,
p. 5, January 1996,
http://www.yorku.ca/yciss/publications/OP31-Workman.pdf)

[The gender critique of war]{.underline} provides a generalized account
of wars and the way they are fought. The gender critique tells us why we
have wars at all. While it is suggestive with respect to the frequency,
character, and scope of war, it does not try to account for the timing
and location of specific wars[. It tells us why war is viewed widely as
an acceptable practice or way to resolve human differences]{.underline}
(although this acceptance invariably is accompanied with obligatory
protestations of reluctance). The gender critique of war, for example,
cannot account for the timing and location of the 1991 Gulf War,
although it can provide an explanation of the warring proclivities of
modern Western states, especially the inconsistency between the peaceful
rhetoric of the US and its incessant warring practices. It can account
for the spectre of war in the aftermath of Vietnam, with the end of the
Cold War, and with the election of George Bush. It is less able to
account for the appearance of war in the Middle East in January of 1991.
The opening intellectual orientation of the gender critique of war rests
upon a constructivist view of human understanding and practice, that is,
a view that anchors practices, including war, within humankind\'s
self-made historico-cultural matrix. This view is contrasted starkly
with those that ground human practices psychologically or biologically
or genetically. [[War is not]{.underline}]{.mark} viewed as [[a natural
practice as if delivered by the Gods; it arises out of human-created
understandings and ways-of- living]{.underline}]{.mark} that have
evolved over the millennia. More specifically, the assumption that men
(the nearly exclusive makers and doers of war) are biologically
hard-wired for aggression and violence is resisted, as is the related
notion that women are naturally passive and non-violent. [[The
explanation for war will not be found in testosterone levels. It is not
the essential or bio-social male that makes war. War is the product of
the gendered understandings of life---understandings of the celebrated
masculine and the subordinated feminine---that have been fashioned over
vast tracts of cultural time]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [[since war
arises from human-created understandings and practices it can be removed
when these understandings change]{.underline}]{.mark}. [War is not
insuperable]{.underline}. Indeed, the rooting of war in human created
phenomena is recognized as a response to the political incapacitation
associated with biologically determinist arguments: \"Attempts of
genetic determinists to show a biological basis for individual
aggression and to link this to social aggression, are not only
unscientific, but they support the idea that wars of conquest between
nations are inevitable.\"8

### AT: Women are in politics

#### Their women in politics example doesn't disprove our argument that dominant politics operates via displays of hegemonic masculinity

[Maruska, 2010]{.underline}. (Jennifer Heeg, PhD in IR from Georgetown,
Lecturer in Political Science and Texas A&M in Qatar, "When are states
hypermasculine?" In Gender and International Security edited by Laura
Sjoberg, p. 248-251, SPP)

Conclusion: hypermasculine politics: [State behavior]{.underline} (by
foreign policy elites and within popular culture) [reflects hegemonic
masculinity, which is just one type of masculinity that occurs at the
top of a hierarchy of power relations]{.underline}. As previously
discussed, various forms of masculinities manifest on the international
stage, including hegemonic masculinity (of Western elites) and other,
subordinated masculinities (such as gay men, men of color; and
non-Western men), as well as many forms of subordinate femininity.
[Hegemonic femininity is perfectly sound as a theoretical concept, but
it is present only when \"feminine\" values dominate the social
structure under analysis. But insofar as states are \"manly,\" the field
of international politics is dominated by states with differing
hegemonic masculinities.]{.underline} American hegemonic masculinity\'s
most recent turn towards hypermasculinity is in stark contrast to
Germany\'s focus on economic primacy. But it does not matter whether
Gerhard Schroeder or Angela Merkel is at the helm: like all other
states, Germany must behave in a manly way in order to compete against
other manly states-and to survive in a feminine anarchy.67 [The point is
well theorized by now that \"when women enter politics, particularly in
areas of foreign policy, they enter an already constructed masculine
world where role expectations are defined in terms of adherence to
preferred masculine attributes such as rationality, autonomy, and
power]{.underline}. \"68 This is adherence to a generalized description
of hegemonic masculinity. What I propose as hypermasculinity goes
further than this, and refers to aggressive and bellicose behavior[. It
is possible that female heads-of-state may be more likely to adhere to a
hypermasculine hegemonic masculinity, in order to minimize their
anatomical female-ness]{.underline}. Television pundits make this point:
[Andrew Sullivan refers to Queens Elizabeth and Victoria, Margaret
Thatcher, and now Hillary Clinton as \"Warrior Queens.]{.underline} \"69
The concepts of hegemonic masculinity, and subordinate masculinities and
femininities, give this punditry (based on intuition and a specific
reading of history) real theoretical heft. [The field of international
politics in the US is dominated almost completely by straight white
men-or women who \"act like men\"]{.underline} (as is frequently said
about Hillary Clinton)\--[or by non-white men and women who conform (by
choice or necessity) to the culture of Washington]{.underline}. Even the
2008 election of President Barack Obama, unprecedented as it was, does
not fundamentally alter this reality. [After all, current First Lady
Michelle Obama\'s senior thesis at Princeton reflected on her
experiences as a Black American at an Ivy League university, stating
that \"the path I have chosen to follow by attending Princeton will
likely lead to my further]{.underline} integration and/or [assimilation
into a White cultural and social structure that will only allow me to
remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full
participant.\"]{.underline} Furthermore, she continues in the next
paragraph, \"as I enter my final year at Princeton, I find myself
striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates.\" It remains
to be seen, but while some may hope that the Obama administration ushers
in an era where the particular strand of hegemonic masculinity is less
hypermasculine than it was immediately following 9/11, international
politics remains as imbued with hegemonic masculinity as ever.
Acceptable behavior in international politics transcends the
individual's race or gender; to get to a position of power[, all
participants]{.underline} (gay, straight, male, female, light or
dark-skinned[) must conform to the \"cult of \[hegemonic\]
masculinity.\"]{.underline} As Carol Cohn has showed us in the field of
nuclear strategy, \"learning the language is a transformative, not an
additive, process[.\" Heads of state must be perceived as strong on
national security; national security relies on war or the threat of
war.]{.underline} This is hegemonic masculinity in the extreme.
[Hegemonic masculinity is international politics, and international
politics is hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. In the words of two
feminist theorists \"international politics is a process which is always
already gendered and which is maintained as gender-neutral only in
reducing gender to \'women\' and their particular concerns.\"73 [If
gender is not widely considered to be useful as a line of inquiry into
politics, it is only because politics are dominated so completely by the
mindset of hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. As R. W. Connell wrote:

### AT: Women's Participation Increasing = Progress

#### **Increasing representation of women defers structural change and abets the system** 

**Griffin, 2015**. (Penny, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of New South Wales, Australia. "crisis, austerity and
gendered governance: a feminist perspective," in *feminist review* 109:
49-72, spp)

Essentialism has been no obstacle to the rapid uptake of the 'rise of
gender harmony' in governance discourse on finance. Frequently described
and represented as more responsible, nurturing, financially cautious and
intrinsically less corrupt (see, for instance, Stern, 2001; World Bank,
2001), [women have found themselves positioned]{.underline} in recent
discussions of financial crisis [as a solution to the excesses of
male-dominated finance, in a show of essentialism that governance
feminism has run with in its agenda for getting more women in
boardrooms]{.underline} and on trading floors. Economic observers have
frequently attributed the seeds of the global financial crisis 'to a
combination of reckless risk-taking and outright corruption' and, just
as 'risk-taking has been laid at the door of masculinity, so too has
corruption' (Fogg, 2013). Accordingly, women 'are simply more honest',
more trustworthy and public-spirited and less corrupt than men (ibid.).
They are also 'naturally' more prone to long-term thinking or empathic
and prosocial behaviour than men (ibid.). Policy-oriented studies have
emerged to demonstrate 'that including women is good for business' and
evidence has been marshalled to show that firms that promote women into
management are more profitable, better organised, accountable, motivated
and innovative (Prügl, 2012: 29). Making 'women's difference productive
for the solution of the crisis', such accounts have centralised women's
supposed patience, their consistence and their attention to detail
(ibid.: 30). Importantly, however (and in case men begin to feel
threatened by all this attention on women's gifts), these accounts have
redeemed men in finance by extolling women's contributions to profit in
conjunction with men's tendency towards extremes, painting women as
'competent associate\[s\] in a common endeavor' (ibid.: 31). Iceland's
efforts to 'signal a new culture within the banking system' (Wall Street
Journal, 2008), appointing female chief executives to the newly
nationalised Icelandic banks, serves as a good example of the extent to
which essentialist, and behavioural, explanations have monopolised
contemporary accounts of financial crisis. According to Salam, the
'macho men of the heavily male-dominated global finance sector' created
the conditions for global economic collapse', assisted by 'their mostly
male counterparts in government' (Salam, 2009: 68). Women, on the other
hand, are less inclined to 'risky' behaviour on financial markets
(except when menstruating; see Lite, 2008). As Elias (2013: 161) notes,
women's perceived carefulness as consumers (according to Global Gender
Gap reporting) also makes them better placed as managers of household
finances. According to the WEF, they are 'driving the
post-financial-crisis-economic-recovery' not only though their 'retail
power' but by 'engaging in acts of consumption that enable them to break
with traditional gender stereotypes in favor of an empowered gender
identity as consumer' (ibid.: 161--162). [Governance feminism's embrace
of the neo-liberal market guarantees that it firmly avoids questions
that might challenge the shape of the economic system that has led to
crisis. Governance feminism, and governance feminism's response to
financial crisis, has been extensively silent on the gendered
underpinnings of global governance, and global finance in particular,
focusing instead on a particular]{.underline} (and perhaps unsurprising)
[support for institutional measures to enhance women's
participation.]{.underline} The increasing prevalence of descriptions of
gender that directly correlate low gender gaps with high economic
competitiveness is, as Elias (2013: 159) notes, a powerful instrument of
governance, feeding into states' obsessions with their national economic
competitiveness and 'thus legitimating neoliberal competitiveness
enhancing policy agendas'. While it may be, then, 'no bad thing that an
organisation such as the WEF has placed gender prominently on its issue
agenda', since this can legitimate 'a focus on gender issues within
state and nonstate arenas and within international organisations', the
'inevitability about [the way in which gender issues are
instrumentalised in order to link women's empowerment and gender
equality straightforwardly to economic growth and competitiveness'
is,]{.underline} Elias notes, [troubling. 'By disappearing feminism in
favour of technical measurement and celebrity humanitarianism',
governance feminism simply reiterates problematic visions of gender
'whereby gender equality and women's empowerment' can be understood only
in relation to their 'ability to serve the market economy']{.underline}
(ibid.: 166--167).

### AT: Pinkner

#### Pinker's "violence down" argument ignores military modernization, nuclear arsenals, and [sanitizes interventionism]{.underline}

**Robinson 19** (Nathan J., PhD student in Sociology & Social Policy.
Nathan is interested in criminal justice policy, particularly in
Louisiana. His research focuses on adult education in U.S. prisons and
on the politics of indigent legal defense. At Yale Law School, he
co-directed the Green Haven Prison Project and worked for the New

[Nuclear weapons pose a strong challenge to Pinker's thesis of declining
violence, one he never dealt with adequately]{.underline}. He argues in
his books that the "long peace" since World War II was not the result of
nuclear weapons, and argues that nukes are essentially "useless in
winning wars and in keeping the peace" since no country would dare to
use them: "Incinerating massive numbers of noncombatants would shred the
principles of distinction and proportionality that govern the conduct of
war and would constitute the worst war crimes in history. That can make
even politicians squeamish, so a taboo grew up around the use of nuclear
weapons, effectively turning them into bluffs." Of course, this means
the United States itself has committed the "worst war crimes in history"
since it intentionally dropped nuclear weapons on two civilian
populations. And [while there is certainly a "taboo" on such
behavior---Hiroshima horrified much of the world, though Americans tend
to think it was fine---U.S. commanders contemplated using nuclear
weapons in Vietnam, too]{.underline}. (Good thing Lyndon Johnson got a
bit "squeamish," although not so squeamish as to stop a war that killed
two million Vietnamese people.) [Realizing that the presence of
thousands of weapons that can vaporize cities, and the giant U.S. war
machine constantly researching terrifying swarms of autonomous flying
death robots, **rather undercuts the whole Most Peaceful Era Ever
theory,**]{.underline} [Pinker]{.underline} points to the fact that "the
United States has reduced its inventory by 85 percent from its 1976
peak." He concedes, however, that "[Cynics might be unimpressed by a
form of progress that still leaves the world with 10,200 atomic
warheads]{.underline}." Indeed, cynics might! The big problem with
[Pinker's violence thesis]{.underline} has always been that it
**[declares victory prematurely]{.underline}**. He is quite clear in
saying he doesn't think peace is necessarily here to stay, or that
progress can't unravel, and thinks this should silence critics who think
he is overly optimistic. But the truth is that **[we're just not far
enough past the end of World War II to begin to comment on a general
trend]{.underline}**. The two global bloodbaths occurred within the
lifetimes of people who are still alive. Over the course of human
history, this is a nanosecond. [It's not a "long peace," but a very
short one]{.underline}. One should probably not be drawing any
conclusions about what kind of era this is until we've seen a bit more
of it, otherwise [you might end up like the people who said World War
One had been the war to "end all wars]{.underline}." Others have pointed
out that [Pinker's worldview requires him to minimize]{.underline} some
pretty heinous **[violence, especially that perpetrated by the United
States]{.underline}**. (A good overview of this is found in the
International Socialist Review.) He trumpets Democratic Peace Theory
without much attention to the way the "democratic" U.S. has squelched
popular uprisings abroad that threaten its interests. He even goes so
far as to say: "Among respectable countries... conquest is no longer a
thinkable option. A politician in a democracy today who suggested
conquering another country would be met not with counterarguments but
with puzzlement, embarrassment, or laughter." Probably true, if they
said "conquering." If they said "liberating" or "spreading democracy
to," on the other hand, they'd be met with quite a different reaction!
[To avoid acknowledging U.S. aggression, he has to downplay the
hideousness of the Vietnam War, and mostly blames
"communists]{.underline}" for it, saying that "the three deadliest
postwar conflicts were fueled by Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese
communist regimes that had a fanatical dedication to outlasting their
opponents" and "the American democracy was willing to sacrifice a tiny
fraction of the lives that the North Vietnamese dictator was willing to
forfeit." [This exoneration of the U.S. for the Vietnamese deaths is
downright despicable, and Pinker needs to get himself much better
acquainted with the reality of what we did.]{.underline} Naturally,
Pinker is more critical of anti-nuclear activists than of the military
industrial complex. "Stop telling everyone they're doomed," he warns.
"The message that many antinuclear activists want to convey is 'any day
now we will all die horribly unless the world immediately takes steps
which it has absolutely no chance of taking." And after all, "the world
has survived half-mad despots with nuclear weapons before, namely Stalin
and Mao, who were deterred from using them, or, more likely, never felt
the need." Very reassuring. (He also points out that "war is illegal.")
Illustration by Mike Freiheit What's maddening about
[Pinker's]{.underline} body of recent [work]{.underline} is that it
[attacks the very people who are doing the most to address the problems
he says he cares about.]{.underline} **[Progress is made by
progressives]{.underline}**, as Jeremy Lent pointed out, and it's
yesterday's "social justice warriors" that are responsible for the
declines in racist language and corporal punishment that Pinker shows
off as accomplishments of Our Great Liberal Democratic Capitalist Order.
[The Pinkers of times past were the one Martin Luther King was
addressing in Letter From Birmingham Jail, who placed trust in the
"benevolent forces of modernity" to make things better rather than
actually taking part in a social movement]{.underline}. As my friend Sam
Miller McDonald put it, "most of those good things that Steven Pinker
likes to brag about came about because of the hard work and sacrifice of
the kind of people Steven [Pinker]{.underline} likes to complain about."
Indeed, Pinker is quite open that he doesn't believe in "struggle." He
views political problems as "mistakes," errors to be corrected through
the application of rationality, rather than "conflicts" between values
and interests. He wants to "depoliticize issues as much as possible" and
"treat politics as science, engineering, or medicine." This is why he
[refuses to see that certain kinds of power are zero-sum, that the
interests of the boss does not coincide with the interests of the
worker]{.underline}. That would mean that advancing the interests of the
worker required a political fight, rather than simply the application of
technology. This is the Obama worldview, and [the Obama presidency
proved why it doesn't work]{.underline}. [It turns out that interests do
conflict, and that if you try to take actions that enrich working people
and threaten corporate power, the people whose power is threatened will
do **everything they possibly can to destroy you**]{.underline}. Steven
[Pinker's works]{.underline} are worth examining for a few reason. For
one thing, they sh**[ow how deeply conservative a "liberal" worldview
can be]{.underline}**. Pinker is all for Equal Rights, Democracy,
Sensible Regulation, Secularism, and the other great Liberal values. And
yet [like many liberals, he seems to detest the left more than the hard
right]{.underline}. ([He infamously praised the "highly literate, highly
intelligent" alt-right.]{.underline} Then when he was criticized, he
said: "A lot of people who are ignorant of the alt-right equate them
with the skinheads and the Nazis carrying the tiki torches, I was
referring to the alt-right strictly from its origins in internet
discussion groups." So, not Richard Spencer, but... Richard Spencer?)
[He]{.underline} simply [accepts the right-wing narrative of various
events]{.underline}. This often shows up in small framing comments.
Bernhard Goetz was "a mild-mannered engineer" who "became a folk hero
for shooting four young muggers," not a vigilante who attacked four
Black men after one of them asked him for money. (I've never looked up
what Pinker thinks of James Damore, but I'm sure he thinks he was an
intelligent young man fired for reporting the uncontroversial results of
scientific studies.\*) [He partly defends the Tuskegee syphilis
study]{.underline}, calling it a "one-time failure to prevent harm to a
few dozen people," that "may even have been defensible by the standards
of the day" (It was actually 400 people that the United States
government allowed to believe they were being treated for syphilis when
they weren't, and it lasted 40 years.)
