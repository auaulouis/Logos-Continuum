Nevertheless, [a space race]{.underline} born from the Cold War
[continues to **unfold**]{.underline}. While the current space race may
not have the same monopoly on the American imagination as the sprint to

We are now [witnessing the rapid and increasingly international
development of **anti-satellite weapons**]{.underline}. The [race for

conflict**]{.underline}---[it could **jeopardize** all future **space

What Are Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASATs)?

Difficult to define, ASATs occupy a gray zone in international arms
control. On one level, they are exactly what the term suggests: weapons
designed to destroy or limit satellites for military purposes, such as
undermining the command and control centers of an adversary's military.
ASATs can function in several ways. For example, kinetic energy ASATs
(KE-ASATs) destroy satellites by physically colliding with them at high
velocities. Drones, ballistic missiles, and explosives detonated near
satellites can all function as KE-ASATs.

Conversely, non-kinetic ASATs use any non-physical mechanism to render a
satellite inoperative, such as blinding satellites with lasers,
launching cyberattacks, or jamming frequencies.

But definitional issues arise because any technology that can physically
or non-kinetically damage a satellite can be considered an ASAT weapon.
For example, supposedly benign technology aimed at removing defunct
satellites or other space junk---known as Active Debris Removal (ADR)
technology---can also remove active satellites. With ostensibly civil
but covertly military capabilities or functions, many space
technologies, including ADR, are put in a category commonly known as
"dual-use." The dual-use nature of space infrastructure makes
differentiating between weapon and non-weapon nearly impossible. As a
result, regulating ASATs---and many other space-based weapons
systems---is extremely difficult.

A Brief History of ASAT Proliferation

The earliest ASAT testing began during the Cold War, when the success of
Sputnik I in October of 1957 catalyzed American fears about the Soviet
Union's potential goal of developing nuclear armed satellites capable of
circling the globe. In response, the US developed its first ASAT: Bold
Orion, an air-launched ballistic missile. The Soviet Union responded
with its own ASAT program, developing weapons through the 1960s and 70s
known as co-orbitals. Unlike previous KE-ASAT designs, these co-orbitals
worked by syncing up with a target satellite's orbit, then detonating.

The United States responded to Soviet co-orbitals in the 1980s with the
ASM-135 weapon, an air-launched KE-ASAT distinguished by its hit-to-kill
method. Unlike the Soviet co-orbitals, the hit-to-kill system did not
require explosives; it just used the energy generated by the collision
between the craft and the satellite, making delivery more stable. In a
1985 demonstration authorized by President Ronald Reagan, an ASM-135
successfully destroyed a defunct satellite.

Roughly 30 years later, China joined the space race. In 2007, China
successfully tested a KE-ASAT, destroying an old weather satellite with
a ballistic missile. And just last year, India also successfully tested
an ASAT in what the Indian government referred to as Mission Shakti.

As of 2018, Russia and China were still developing more advanced
non-kinetic ASATs. Russia is specifically developing an ASAT system
known as Nudol, which operates in Lower Earth Orbit and can move between
orbital paths, threatening more satellites than weapons limited to just
one orbital path. So, despite the end of the Cold War era, more and more
nations are jumping into a space arms race that is resulting in the
rapid proliferation of advanced space weaponry.

The ASAT Appeal

A global fixation on anti-satellite weapons is arguably the logical end
result of the main American project of the late 20th and early 21st
century: the movement to digital communications. Via the telephone,
computers, and eventually the internet, the United States pioneered the
use of space-based communications for most civil and military functions.
The benefits of satellite-based communications---namely increased
efficiency, precision, and volume of information transmitted---are
self-evident; however, the US lead in the transition to space-based
systems posed a threat: relying on satellites for military use more than
any other country created an asymmetric dependency. In other words, an
unexpected denial of space-enabled information or capabilities would be
more debilitating to the United States than to any other country because
no other country is as dependent on satellite communications. In an era
of US hegemony, powers like Russia, China, and India are looking for
arenas in which they can make the most gains against a conventionally
stronger opponent. The space race has an asymmetric nature: the more the
United States develops in space, the more it has to lose. Thus, space
warfare provides an arena where emerging powers can gain a strategic
advantage relative to the US. More broadly, ASATs are also desirable
because they can function as conflict deterrents. If a conflict arises,
countries may be less likely to escalate if they believe their opponents
are capable of essentially blinding their military. Just as two nuclear
armed opponents risk mutually assured destruction (MAD), two ASAT armed
countries risk mutual impotence. If they both can "turn off" each
other's militaries---or deny access to the satellites upon which their
opponent's conventional and nuclear forces rely---both countries are
rendered close to defenseless, a risk they would be extremely reluctant
to take.

A Uniquely Dangerous Arms Race

Despite their deterrent functions, ASATs are more likely to provoke or
exacerbate conflicts than dampen them, especially given the risk they
pose to early warning satellites. These satellites are a crucial element
of US ballistic missile defense, capable of detecting missiles
immediately after launch and tracking their paths. Suppose a US early
warning satellite goes dark, or is shut down. Going dark could signal a
glitch, but in a world in which other countries have ASATs, it could
also signal the beginning of an attack. Without early warning
satellites, the United States is much more susceptible to nuclear
missiles. Given the strategy of counterforcing---targeting nuclear silos
rather than populous cities to prevent a nuclear counterattack---the
Americans might believe their nuclear weapons are imminently at risk. It
could be twelve hours before the United States regains satellite
function, which is too long to wait to put together a nuclear
counterattack. The United States, therefore, might move to mobilize a
nuclear attack against Russia or China over what might just be a piece
of debris shutting off a satellite. Additionally, accidental warfare, or
strategic miscalculation, is uniquely likely in space. It is much easier
to hold an adversary's space systems in jeopardy with destructive ASATs
than it is to sustainably defend a system, which is expensive and in
some cases not technologically feasible because of limitations on
satellite movement. Space is therefore considered offense-dominant;
offensive tactics like weapons development are prioritized over
defensive measures, such as improving GPS or making satellites more
resistant to jamming.

As a result, countries are left with poorly defended space systems and
rely on offensive posturing, which increases the risk that their actions
are perceived as aggressive and incentivizes rapid, risky counterattacks
because militaries cannot rely on their spaced-based systems after first
strikes.

There are several hotspots in which ASATs and offensive-dominant systems
are particularly relevant. Early warning satellites play a central role
in US readiness in the event of a conflict involving North Korea. News
of North Korean missile launches comes from these satellites. Given
North Korea's history of nuclear provocations, unflinchingly hostile
rhetoric towards the United States and South Korea, and diplomatic
opacity, North Korea is always a threatening, unknowable adversary, but
recent developments have magnified the risk. With the health of Kim
Jong-un potentially in jeopardy, a succession battle or even civil war
on the peninsula raises the chances of loose nukes. If the regime is
terminal, traditional MAD risk calculus will become moot; with nothing
to lose, North Korea would have no reason to hold back its nuclear
arsenal. Or China might decide to seize military assets and
infrastructure of the regime. If the US does not have its early warning
satellites because they have been taken out in an ASAT attack, the US,
South Korea, and Japan are all in imminent nuclear peril, while China
could be in a position to fundamentally reshape East Asian geopolitics.

The South China Sea is another hotspot in which ASATs could risk
escalation. China is developing Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) in the
South China Sea, a combination of long range radar with air and maritime
defense meant to deny US freedom of navigation in the region. Given the
disputed nature of territory in the South China Sea, the United States
and its allies do not want China to successfully close off the region.

But the most effective way to break an A2/AD system would be with
anti-satellite weapons. ASATs could neutralize the maritime surveillance
China relies upon to deny access to the region and guide cruise
missiles. Thus, China is extremely wary of US ASAT development: risks to
Beijing's South China Sea strategy are seen as threats to China itself
because of territorial sovereignty claims that are deeply important to
the regime and have only become more pronounced under President Xi
Jinping. If a Chinese satellite went dark, Beijing might perceive it as
a US ASAT designed to undermine the A2/AD approach, and escalate with
conventional force.

An Even Greater Risk

Many of these conflict scenarios start with the loss of satellite
function, which may seem unlikely. But [[ASATs]{.mark} threaten
satellites through more than just **direct attack**]{.underline}. [ASAT
testing]{.underline}, rather than deployment, [[risks]{.mark} the
**[exponential]{.mark} [accumulation]{.mark}** [of
debris]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which **endangers
satellites**]{.underline} and creates a host of other problems.

KE-[ASATs rely on smashing satellites into thousands of
pieces]{.underline}, so [each test adds **tremendous** **amounts** of
space debris]{.underline}. The 2007 Chinese KE-ASAT test alone increased
the number of objects in orbit by 20 percent, producing more than two
thousand pieces of debris large enough to be tracked and likely
thousands more too small to be counted that will remain in orbit for
centuries.

[[Even]{.mark} the [**smallest** pieces]{.mark} [of debris]{.mark} can
[do **great damage**]{.mark}]{.underline}; traveling at more than 15,000
miles per hour, they can crash into other debris in a proliferation
known as the **[[Kessler Syndrome]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The situation
in space could approach a critical mass in which collision cascading
occurs even if all launches were halted, [[choking orbits]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [debris]{.mark} [until]{.mark} **[all]{.mark}
[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}** are **[destroyed]{.mark}** and
[spaceflight rendered]{.mark} **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Compared to the negligible debris created during commercial launches,
[ASAT tests]{.underline}---especially [if the arms race continues to
escalate]{.underline} and countries with less developed space programs
join with cruder designs---[may **accelerate** the debris in space
closer and closer to this **critical mass**]{.underline}.

If debris knocks out a satellite, an increasingly likely possibility in
a world with ASAT tests, then the aforementioned conflict scenarios
become more likely. Conflict aside, ASAT-based debris clouds are
terrifying in their own right. Public health, transportation, climate
science, and a litany of other crucial infrastructures are dependent on
satellites that are now at risk. Satellite GPS is a cornerstone of the
modern economy; some pundits believe that the slightest glitch in GPS
satellites could shock the stock market and further destabilize an
unstable global economy. During the pandemic, satellites are playing a
crucial role in geospatial data collection for infectious disease
modeling.

Essentially, it is hard to imagine a world without satellites, but that
is a possible outcome given that there are no reliable methods of
withdrawing debris from space.

Starting Small

There are two conflicting views on how the US could mitigate the worst
effects of an ASAT arms race. The first, put forward by Secretary of
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in 2001, is fairly simple: Space
militarization is inevitable, and the United States will have to rely on
superior capabilities to prevent conflict---essentially, end the arms
race by winning it. This is classic escalation dominance theory: the
idea that sustainable deterrence can be created when a nation escalates
conflict to a level greater than their adversary can match.

However, the nature of an arms race makes escalatory advantages
inherently ephemeral, and the advances Russia and China have made since
Rumsfeld's 2001 report suggest that relying on US space superiority
might be a poor strategy. Even if it were possible, attaining escalation
dominance would require near constant weapons testing, which produces
more debris.

The second viewpoint calls for an end to the arms race not by winning it
but by calling it off entirely, through comprehensive space arms
control. Such regulations are complicated and have a long history, but
could be a more sustainable solution than an endless proliferation of
weapons.

The first iteration of arms control in space came in the 1960s. The 1963
Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) banned nuclear weapons tests in outer
space, and the more comprehensive 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST),
considered the cornerstone of peaceful space development, prohibited any
military activity on celestial bodies including stationing weapons of
mass destruction (WMD) in space. Both treaties are still in effect
today, but despite additional treaties in recent decades, there are
still no international regulations banning weapons other than WMD in
space.

The most recent attempt at an ASAT ban was proposed by Russia and China
in 2014. A revision of a draft from 2008, the Treaty on Prevention of
the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of
Force Against Outer Space Objects (PPWT) was rejected by the United
States because it lacked verification and permitted the stockpiling of
terrestrial-based ASAT systems. It only banned space-based ASATs, which
would enable China and Russia to continue developing ground-launched
systems known as direct-ascent ASATs.

The PPWT was an empty solution for an arms race, clearly designed to
benefit Russia and China rather than prevent additional weapons
development. But a comprehensive agreement that the US, Russia, and
China all find satisfactory seems unlikely. The Proposed Prevention of
an Arms Race in Space Treaty (PAROS) has been discussed since the 1980s
without much progress.

Perhaps a more feasible solution is a limited test ban treaty: an
agreement to stop testing debris-producing ASATs. It has precedent---the
PTBT successfully prevented the testing of nuclear weapons in
space---and could stave off the worst effects of debris accumulation by
eliminating debris-producing tests. Additionally, in the long term, a
test ban could reduce countries' confidence in their ASATs; capabilities
atrophy without regular testing, meaning countries would be less likely
to base their military strategies on ASATs in the event of a conflict.

By banning specific systems, a test ban treaty is not too vague as to be
unenforceable like the PPWT, but it could be limited enough to not
affect broader space development. Russia and China might find the terms
acceptable; after all, debris threatens their satellites too, and they
have a reciprocal interest in reining in US weapons development.

It's [hard to conceive of a future for humanity that does not feature
space]{.underline} in some capacity. Big businesses are already pursuing
space commerce more aggressively, with visions of space colonies and
large scale resource extraction. But the continued, [[unchecked]{.mark}
**[prolif]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration [[of **ASATs**]{.mark} could
**[close off]{.mark}** [space]{.mark}
**[entirely]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and help **induce**]{.mark} a
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Now, more than ever, it
remains urgent and imperative that international negotiations reach an
arms control treaty.

lamenting voices are being heard on US strategic vulnerabilities, on how
the Congressional cuts in space funding is putting US at a strategic
disadvantage, this analyst believes that no one is any less. If you
nearly control the global open source, you tell less about you than
others. However, a discerning mind knows that there is more than what
meets the eye. I say this in context of US though some of their SOS
cries are viable.

The technology revamping up the ABM capability from the terminal to
mid-course interception has come as a shot in the arm for the ASAT
capability that has got a quantum range-altitude boost, especially in
the category of hit-to-kill ASAT weapons. In fact, all midcourse
Ballistic systems have inherent ASAT capabilities.

There has been a self-defeating effort on the part of US to create a
duality between the midcourse BMD systems (say SM 3) and the direct
ascent Kinetic energy interceptors (like the Chinese SC 19). By calling
the former as low-altitude direct ascent interceptor and the later, as
kinetic energy weapon . It is like calling the Peter, Pam when both are
same. The typical Mine OK yours Not OK syndrome. It doesn\'t really
carry.

The race to acquire ASAT capability is going on unabated. One nation
setting a challenging pace and putting the others in a vicious
merry-goround.

Are ASATs legal?

Before seeing the legality, let me put the weaponisation and
militarisation argument to rest. How does it sound when I say that with
all the humdrum at the global level of using the outer space - the
'province of mankind' for 'peaceful purposes', the same, technically
speaking, long stands weaponised, what to talk of its militarisation,
that happened ab-initio. That is the truth, as I will unfold in
technical terms in due course.

Moreover, putting legality aside, [the ASAT tests of the leading
spacefaring Nations are going unhindered- Chinese ASAT test
in]{.underline} January 2007, 2008, [**2013**,
**2016**]{.underline}\...US ASAT tests 2008, 2010.. Russians ASAT tests

of**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**humanity** on which the **entire
Planet**]{.mark} **has come to [depend LIKE NEVER
BEFORE]{.mark}**]{.underline} \.... Who cares?

Why? The Big Question. Why it is happening unabated? Why nobody can
crack a whip. Sample this commentary:-

The OST, 1967 or more formally, 'The Treaty or Principles Governing the
Activities of States in Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including
Moon and Other Celestial Bodies', not only forms the basis for
International Space Laws, but also, has the widest acceptability in the
world community (as of Sep 2015, 104 countries are a party to the
treaty, another 24 have signed but not completed the ratification).8

In its essence, the OST lays down (only relevant portions quoted) the
following:-

It bars the States Parties from placing nuclear weapons or any other
weapons of mass destruction in the orbit of earth, installing them on
Moon or any other celestial body or to otherwise station them in space9.

It exclusively limits the use of Moon and other celestial bodies to
peaceful purposes and explicitly prohibits their use for testing of
weapons of any kind, conducting military manoeuvres or establishing
military bases, installations and fortifications.

It forbids [[any government]{.underline}]{.mark} from claiming a
celestial resource such as Moon or a planet. It forbids natural
opportunities of outer space, including Moon and other celestial bodies.

A State Party to the Treaty [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} has reasons to
[[believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[any
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} an
**[[experiment]{.underline}]{.mark}** planned by other State Party in
outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies, [would
[cause]{.mark} potentially **['harmful interference']{.mark}** with
activities on **peaceful exploration**]{.underline} [of outer
space]{.underline} including the Moon and other celestial bodies
[[may]{.underline} **['request consultation']{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**concerning the activity or experiment**.]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} above [[provisions have]{.underline}
**[glaring inadequacies]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For instance:

> ● The treaty does not prohibit the development, placement and testing
> of conventional weapons in the outer space.
>
> ● It does not prohibit a ground based weapon making a direct/ indirect
> ascent into outer space and killing an orbital body.
>
> ● It also does not prohibit a space based weapon (Kinetic Energy or

>
> ● By implication, military activities in outer space are allowed

>
> ▪ [[What constitutes]{.underline} [**'harmful interference'**;
> is]{.underline} **[shrouded in ambiguity]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

The Treaty, adopted through the UN process, is non-binding and devoid of
any enforcement mechanism. Responsibility towards discharge is only
'assumed'.

In fact, under the garb of 'peaceful use' and 'scientific research for
peaceful purposes', as enshrined in the OST, US, China and Russia have
put a perfectly legal cover over their hectic development of space
technologies capable of military applications.

Judging against the above loopholes, the ASAT tests of China, US and
Russia would appear to be perfectly legal. That is however not the whole
truth as the same could be faulted under Article IX of OST, as also,
under Liability Convention.

This is how Article IX of OST mandates the State Parties to conduct
activities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial
bodies, with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other
State Parties to the Treaty.

It forbids them from conducting such activities which would cause
'harmful interference' with activities of other State.

State Parties are also to avoid harmful contamination and adverse
changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction
of 'extra-terrestrial matter' (in outer space)10.

A Sample Case.. Let's talk about one sample case\--the Chinese ASAT test
of 2007 which as I said, has been classified as the highest manmade
debris generation event in the history so far11. Sample this:-

> ➢ As of September 2010, the US Space Surveillance Network (SSN) has
> picked a total of 3037 pieces of debris greater than 10 cms, 97% of
> which have remained in the orbit12.
>
> ➢ Scientists estimate about 1,50,000 debris particles in altitudes
> between 200-4000 kms, 79% of which will remain in orbit for 100
> years13.
>
> ➢ The debris has spread throughout the entire orbit resulting in a
> cloud of debris around earth. This is the largest debris cloud ever
> generated by a single event in the orbit.
>
> ➢ As of January 2007, there were 2864 active or inactive satellites in
> LEO out of which 1899 pass through the region now affected by Chinese
> debris.
>
> ➢ In April 2011, debris of the Chinese test passed close to the
> 'International Space Station14.
>
> ➢ In January 2013, a Russian nano satellite \[Ball Lens in The Space
> (BLITS)\] was destroyed by the debris15.

The Illegality Continues. The illegality of [the Chinese ASAT lays
**bare**]{.underline} not only in [the]{.underline} **[gross violation
of Article IX]{.underline}** of the OST, but also, a potential threat to
the space assets of other State Parties for decades ahead. [Similar is
the story of]{.underline} **[US and Russian ASAT tests]{.underline}**.

Liability Convention. Also, under the Liability Convention 1972 (The
Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space
Objects), a State Party is responsible for all the objects launched from
its territory into space and is full liable for the damage that may
arise from that object. The damage (done/likely) from the Chinese ASAT
must also therefore rest equally on their shoulders.

Other Legalese Also Ambiguous. While the other space laws like the
Rescue Agreement 1968, the Registration Convention 1975, the Moon
Agreement 1979 and International Space Laws governing disbursement of
finite GEO slots by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are
all full of crippling inadequacies, the space constraints prohibit the
author from a detailed commentary on each one of the above.

A Revisit. Though mentioned in passing earlier, lets revisit the
technicalities in militarisation/weaponisation from the point of view of
a legal argument.

Militarization. As per the definition, militarization of space simply
implies the placement and deployment of weapons and military technology
in the outer space. By this definition, the Space was militarized ever
since the earliest communication satellites were launched, since that
implied the deployment of military communication technology in the
Space. [Today, militaries all over [the world **rely** on satellites
for]{.mark}]{.underline} **[command, control, communication,
[monitoring]{.mark}, [early warning]{.mark} and
[navigation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
**[[GPS]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Peaceful uses of outer space thus
include military uses. [This includes]{.underline} even [those
satellites which are not at all peaceful such as using satellites to
divert]{.underline} **[bombing raids]{.underline}** [or to
orchestrate]{.underline} a '**[p]{.underline}**rompt
**[g]{.underline}**lobal **[s]{.underline}**trike' with a view to
control any situation or to defeat any adversary across the range of
military operations. With more than 90% of all satellites dedicated to
military use, truly speaking militarisation of outer space occurred with
the first satellite16.

Weaponisation. Talking of Weaponisation, the same is generally
understood to mean the placement in orbit of space-based devices that
have a destructive capability. What about millions of pieces of space
debris created by the deliberate acts of the countries (ASAT tests)
which have tremendous destruction capability for the space assets of
other countries? What about the ongoing cutting-edge research on the
'kinetic kill' or 'Directed Energy kill weapons' placed in space orbits,
ready to take on incoming ballistic missiles in their post-boost phase,
when these missiles are transiting the outer space. These dual use
weapons, taking on a Ballistic Missile could as well take on the space
assets? [The bottom line is that]{.underline} the
**[weaponisation]{.underline}** of outer space is now a reality. In fact
the same [is]{.underline} **[fast fuelling the global arms
race]{.underline}**17.

The examination of the above legalities thus brings out the following :-

>  [The [current]{.mark} regime of]{.underline} [**[Space

The first successful launch by SpaceX of its new Falcon Heavy rocket,
the most powerful rocket in operation today, offered a tantalizing
glimpse into the future of space --- one done with a touch of typical
flair from SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk, who sent his old red
Tesla sports car into orbit as the rocket's first payload. More
impressive still, from a technical perspective, is that two of the
Falcon Heavy's boosters simultaneously landed back at Cape Canaveral,
ready for refurbishment and reuse.

However, this [breakthrough raises]{.underline} a number of [questions
about how prepared global society is to deal with the **growing
reliance** on space]{.underline}-enabled connectivity, [technology and
services]{.underline}. These support a diverse array of political,
military and economic activities --- many of which modern life on Earth
relies upon and which the public often takes for granted. Governments,
militaries and commercial organizations could take steps now to better
understand and mitigate the risks associated with digital society's
increasing reliance on space.

Space is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global economy, worth
\$329 billion in 2016 and estimated to double to around \$640 billion by
2030. While SpaceX and other companies are looking to create and exploit
new markets through the application of novel technologies, such as space
manufacturing, mining or tourism, Earthbound societies remain
increasingly reliant on a host of more mature space services and
technologies for basic functions.

These [underpin a **dizzying array** of activities across **diverse
sectors**]{.underline}, [including **defense maritime** and **border
security**]{.underline}, **[crisis management]{.underline}**, [and
**transport**]{.underline}. For example, GPS satellites not only allow
for safe navigation in the air, on land and at sea, but also underpin
financial transactions and the protocols that keep data parcels in sync
across the internet and other networks. Without these, [Internet speeds
could slow]{.underline}, [access to the cloud]{.underline} could
[deteriorate]{.underline}, and [control systems for energy
grids]{.underline}, [water and transportation]{.underline} could [begin
to fail]{.underline}.

The [potential for **cascading failures** across the **myriad systems**
reliant on space mean that the effects of any disruption could manifest
themselves in **unexpected places**]{.underline}. When a single U.S.
communications satellite broke down in 1998, it was not only television
and messaging systems that failed. Credit card systems stopped
processing payments, weather radars went blind and frustrated drivers
found themselves unable to fuel their vehicles as automatic petrol
station pumps seized up.

Perhaps [most alarmingly]{.underline}, [satellites are]{.underline} also
[an **essential part** of]{.underline} "[national technical means of
verification]{.underline}" [used by nuclear-armed nations to build trust
around **arms control agreements** through **mutual
surveillance**]{.underline}. [Any nation which suddenly found
itself]{.underline} ~~blind~~ \[**[sightless]{.underline}**\] [in space
might be pushed to **escalate**]{.underline} any military standoff
[through a]{.underline} "**[first strike]{.underline}**" [for fear it
might not detect any missile launches]{.underline} against its
territory.

Similarly worrying are the limits of organizational and societal
preparedness to deal with the aftermath of a major disruption of
essential space-dependent services. Governments warn that such
disruption is becoming increasingly likely in the face of new threats
and challenges.

[Satellite systems are increasingly threatened by **hostile state** and
**nonstate actors**]{.underline}, including through dazzling, jamming,
kinetic impacts and cyber means. The European Commission has also warned
that ground control stations are often vulnerable to terrorists or
cyberattacks. However, perhaps the greatest fear is that any attack
could provoke a chain reaction of collisions that renders entire orbits
useless, known as the Kessler syndrome.

[Faced with this growing panoply of risks to space
infrastructure]{.underline}, [a **concerted response** is needed to
boost the resilience of global society to]{.underline} natural or
~~man-made~~ \[people-made\] disruption of space-dependent services.
Many of the protective measures apply to both, even if threats posed by
solar flares cannot be deterred or negotiated away. In 2012,
Multinational Experiment 7 united 17 nations, various civilian agencies
and NATO in calls for a holistic framework to managing potential space
confrontation: dissuading aggression before, defending satellites during
and maximizing the resilience of both space systems to recover after an
attack.

### ASATs ADV\-\--Catch All

Aggression in Space",

[To keep peace on Earth]{.underline}, [we must keep peace in
space]{.underline}.

The time has come for America to confront the reality that [space has
been weaponized by our adversaries]{.underline}. Space has long been a
peaceful environment for research and commerce on Earth with conditions
that deny tyrants the luxury of concealment, the advantage of surprise,
and establishes parity on the battlefield.

But all of this has changed.

[[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} have [carefully]{.mark}
[studied]{.mark} [how]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [is
**uniquely advantaged** by]{.underline}, [and **[dependent]{.mark}**
up[on]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[space]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the last
20 years, [they have invested heavily in developing
**anti-sat**]{.underline}ellite **[weapons]{.underline}**, deploying
them here on Earth and in orbit.

[There's a purpose for this]{.underline} --- [[to]{.mark} **[enable
aggression]{.mark}** on Earth [by **denying**]{.mark} [America
and]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~her~~ [[allies]{.mark} the [**advantages** of
space]{.mark}]{.underline}. Allies fight as one force, in communication,
aware of the enemy's disposition, and maximizing our impact through
coordinated action. Space gives us that. Russia and China know it.
[Taking space out of our reach would **greatly disadvantage**
us]{.underline}, [[emboldening]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[**authoritarian** governments]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [act]{.mark} with
**coercion** and **violence** [to achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[**regional** and **global [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We [[must deter]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark} [through]{.mark} a **[system
of capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and norms [that **inspire
restraint** in]{.underline} our [adversaries]{.underline}. There is no
simple, single, and quick solution to this problem. It must be viewed
within the classical context of nation-state deterrence in a peer
environment. [This means]{.underline} understanding the motivation for
aggression, [choosing a deterrent strategy]{.underline}, [and fielding
**credible**]{.underline}, obvious **[capabilities]{.underline}**, with
a dash of hesitancy inducing uncertainty.

Fundamentally, a nation attacks to achieve a beneficial change in the
status quo. Our mission, as a peacekeeper, is to discourage hostile and
destructive action.

To do this there are two approaches. One, a nation can allow the
adversary the ability to attack, do harm, and achieve the benefit
sought. However, to deter this action, we would need to make it clear
that we would respond with an overwhelmingly destructive retaliatory
cost that far outweighs any potential perceived benefit. This approach
is known as the artificial imposition of a reciprocal cost, nuclear
deterrence being the classic example.

Alternatively, [a [nation can]{.mark} seek to **[render]{.mark}** any
practical [attack **ineffective**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark} an
[environment where]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark} will [stimulate]{.mark}
**severe [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [an [adversary]{.mark} is
**[discouraged]{.mark}** [from acting]{.mark} when **no conceivable
attack** can succeed]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} clearly [the
**correct approach** for deterring aggression in space]{.underline} for
several reasons.

An attack in space would not immediately threaten U.S. territory or
involve the loss of life. A retaliation on Earth, however, would likely
do so, making it morally ambiguous, and likely inspiring wide
disapproval. [A [retal]{.mark}iation [in space]{.mark}]{.underline},
meanwhile, [would [risk **fowling**]{.mark} the **[global orbital
commons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, potentially doing more harm to all
involved than the adversary's initial attack. We must instead seek the
means to render attacks upon our space assets ineffective.

There are three legs to accomplishing this goal. We [[must
make]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[assets]{.mark} **more
[resilient]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [able to absorb attacks and damage
without immediately collapsing]{.underline}. We must also be prepared to
rapidly replace critical satellites faster than the attacker can exploit
their destruction, and finally, we must deny aggressors easy and
unfettered access to our satellites while on orbit.

We can improve resiliency by several means. Firstly, by distributing
functions across multiple spacecraft where possible. Next, we should
network distributed satellites whenever practical. This ensures that
capabilities degrade slowly as individual satellites are destroyed,
creating a system that absorbs attacks while continuing to fight.
Thirdly, it would complicate the aggressor's task if our satellites had
more ability to maneuver away from threats. Last, but not least,
protecting satellites from hostile cyberattacks will ensure they can
continue to function, denying this easy attack vector.

Unfortunately, not all space functions can be distributed, networked, or
proliferated. To safeguard these critical assets, we should deny the
attacker access to them. Today, China and Russia are free to observe our
launches and spacecraft with largely unfettered access to approach and
attack them. Denying this easy targeting and access is critical.

[We must]{.underline} also [expect that an adversary will succeed in
[disabling]{.mark}]{.underline} or destroying some of our limited
**[[critical]{.mark} [assets]{.mark}]{.underline}** as well as clusters
of contiguous proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) satellites, [thus
[open]{.mark}ing temporary **[windows]{.mark} [of
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We can counter this strategy by replacing
these with assets stored on the ground or in orbit before adversaries
exploit their loss.

[There is **significant concern** today about]{.underline} our
[adversaries']{.underline} lead in [developing]{.underline},
[deploying]{.underline}, [and improving anti-sat]{.underline}ellite
[weapons]{.underline}. This challenge has led some to pursue strategies
that seek to match or catch up to potential adversaries as quickly as
possible.

### ASATs ADV\-\--Escalates

#### Non-kinetic attacks prompt [miscalc]{.underline} and [escalate]{.underline} into [conventional warfare]{.underline}.

HBisevac)

[Sometimes [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, from small ones to big ones,
[[start]{.mark} [with]{.mark} **[accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
early American history, for example, accidents associated with
good-faith errors and unauthorized acts of violence precipitated several
conflicts between the United States and Native American groups. On a
larger scale, Scott Sagan has argued that the 18th-century Seven Years'
War was sparked by a false warning of French invasion and that the
Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 was an unauthorized attack
orchestrated by army officers against the expressed wishes of the
civilian government. [The potential for these sorts of
accidents]{.underline} --- human or technical errors and unauthorized
actions --- [to induce **subsequent escalation** has
produced]{.underline} much [diplomatic effort to mitigate the
risks]{.underline} of stumbling into armed conflict. There are hotlines,
summits, "open skies" agreements, confidence-building measures, and
more. [Yet today the risk of accidents **producing escalation**
**persists**]{.underline}, [especially where states see a **first-mover
advantage** and fear]{.underline} the [consequences of
**underreacting**]{.underline} more than the risks of over-reacting.

The [rising **salience** of **cyber warfare** contributes dangerously to
the traditional set of concerns about the **onset** of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}. Now, in addition to wars waged with bombs and
bullets, [[militaries]{.mark} have [become]{.mark} **[highly
dependent]{.mark}** [upon]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
***bits*** and ***[bytes]{.mark}*** [that]{.mark} **[empower]{.mark}**
their]{.underline} "[sensing and shooting]{.underline}"
**[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And the link between incidents
starting in cyberspace and [ending up in battlespaces]{.underline} on
land, at sea, and in the aerospace environment is getting the attention
of policymakers. So much so that, as President Joe Biden noted that
"we're going to end up, if we end up in a war --- a real shooting war
with a major power --- it's going to be a consequence of a cyber breach
of great consequence."

Some have argued that cyber operations are actually unlikely to prompt
military escalation, but we would argue that this possibility ought to
receive policymaking attention to reduce its probability. [There remains
**much [uncertainty]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the **[frequency]{.mark}**
[and **severity**]{.mark} of cyber accidents that are **occurring now**
and [that]{.mark} [will **arise**]{.mark} in the
**future**]{.underline}. This uncertainty extends to whether any given
cyber accident will spark military escalation. But [a growing body of
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}, beginning with the Moonlight Maze cyber
intrusions into military systems in the late 1990s and other serious
events that have continued to this day, [[make clear]{.mark} that
potential **[adversaries]{.mark}** are [testing out]{.mark}
**[virtual]{.mark} [ways]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[disrupt]{.mark}
physical [operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What sorts of accidents might occur in cyberspace, and how might they
prompt military escalation? We have three basic categories in mind.
First, there are [[human]{.mark} [actions]{.mark} in cyberspace that
could [provoke]{.mark} [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
[[include]{.mark} human errors]{.underline}, such as mistaken
perceptions. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, a U.S.
destroyer's use of training depth charges to target a Soviet submarine
very nearly led the submarine's captain to launch a nuclear torpedo
because he reportedly believed a war might have already started. The
difficulties of ascertaining intent and attributing responsibility for
actions in cyberspace may produce similar human errors.
[Alternatively]{.underline}, [**intentional [actions]{.mark}** [not
**authorized**]{.mark} by any proper authority]{.underline} would fit
this category. [Non-state-affiliated **[hackers]{.mark}**]{.underline},
for example, [could]{.underline} individually or collectively
[[target]{.mark} or unintentionally affect **[highly sensitive
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as those related to critical
infrastructure, conventional military systems, or nuclear
command-and-control processes. Similarly, [[state]{.mark}-linked
**[cyber]{.mark} [proxies]{.mark}** could [engage]{.mark} in such
actions [of]{.mark} their **[own volition]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} their [actions]{.mark} **[incorrectly attributed]{.mark}**
to their state sponsor]{.underline}.

As a case in point, [in 2001]{.underline} through 2002, Gary
**[[McKinnon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Briton whose autism played a
central role in his legal defenses after he was caught, [[hacked]{.mark}
into U.S. [military]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} in a purported
effort to uncover information about unidentified flying objects he
believed the U.S. government was hiding. This [hack [kept]{.mark} about
**[2,000]{.mark} military [computers]{.mark} [offline]{.mark}** [for
**days**]{.mark}]{.underline}, caused alarm in the Pentagon ---
[[American]{.mark} air [defenses]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the Atlantic
Fleet's [logistics]{.mark} had been [compromised]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- and led to questions about who was targeting the United States and
who ought to face retribution. The prosecutor in charge of the effort to
extradite him from the United Kingdom described the incident as "the
biggest military computer hack of all time." Needless to say, had this
occurred during a major international crisis --- and [[had the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[failed]{.mark} [to]{.mark} sufficiently [harden]{.mark} those military
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline} despite being in a crisis --- [the
[consequences]{.mark} could have been **[dire]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Our second category of concerns is about **[[technical
errors]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [could [lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
military [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [During the Cold
War]{.underline}, for example, there were [occasions]{.underline} on
[which the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} the [Soviet Union]{.underline} each [thought the
**other** had begun a **nuclear attack**]{.underline}. In the American
case, a war-scenario training tape was mistakenly inserted and played at
a strategic command. On the Soviet side, a computer malfunction reported
that five American missiles were heading toward the Soviet Union.
Fortunately, those involved in both cases waited long enough before
retaliating to ascertain that their identification of an incoming attack
was mistaken, but [there is **[no guarantee]{.mark}** that such
[events]{.mark} will always **[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} so well.
That we are all still here speaks to the caution that nuclear weapons
can induce. [[In]{.mark} the [case of escalation]{.mark} to conventional
military action [from]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark} operations]{.underline},
however, [[those]{.mark} [involved]{.mark} may be **[less
cautious]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The third category of potential problems consists of [intentional
[cyber]{.mark} [operations]{.mark}]{.underline} that [may [have
**unintended consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Due to]{.mark} the
**[complexity]{.mark}** and **interconnectedness** of advanced
information systems]{.underline}, [any offensive cyber operation
engenders **uncertainty** as to the effects it will cause]{.underline}.
Thus, to the extent that human and/or technical errors could be the
source of such effects, it is worth considering them here. One could
imagine, for example, that either Israeli or Iranian cyber operations
targeting the other in their current "virtual conflict" might yield
greater consequences than the attacker intended. [[In]{.mark} an
**[already tense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [volatile
[situation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such a perceived
escalation]{.underline}, **[even if unintended]{.underline}**, might
[[prompt]{.mark} an [armed]{.mark}]{.underline},
"**[[kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[response]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## SSA Adv

### SSA ADV\-\--AT: Governance Turn

#### Space weapon deployment doesn't cause an arms race or increase chance of war

**Lopez 12** \[LAURA DELGADO LO´ PEZ, Institute for Global Environmental
Strategies, Arlington, Virginia. Astropolitics. \"Predicting an Arms
Race in Space: Problematic Assumptions for Space Arms Control.\"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14777622.2012.647391\]

[The previous discussion demonstrates]{.underline} that
[[although]{.mark} a]{.underline} globalized [[space arms race could
follow U.S. deployment]{.mark} of space weapons, [it
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also plausible and **[[more]{.mark}
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[it may **not happen at
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Mueller states: ''In the end, most of
[the]{.underline} inevitability [[arguments are
**weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}.''62 The assumptions discussed here break
the argument into a series of debatable maxims that other scholars have
also considered. Hays, for instance, counters the inevitability argument
by pointing out that [**previous [ASAT tests]{.mark}** [did **not** have
this]{.mark} purported **destabilizing [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline},
to which we can add that even after the Chinese ASAT test, neither
Russia nor the United States, who would be both capable and more
politically likely to launch space weapons, moved forward in that
direction.63 Although some may draw attention to the recent wake-up
calls in order to underline a sense of urgency, one should also recall
that when it seemed truly inevitable before, it did not happen either.
In his detailed account of military space developments from 1945 to
1984, Paul Stares described how superpowers' assessment of the value of
space weapons shifted, with a ''hiatus in testing'' reflecting the
attractiveness of satellites as military targets.64 In this changed
landscape, Stares also assumed the inevitability argument, claiming that
''the chances of space remaining a 'sanctuary' \[absence of weapons\]
into the 21st century appear today to be remote.''65 Perhaps the
conditions are more conducive now, but the important point to be
reiterated is that the outcome is not inevitable, and that any such
prediction must be undertaken with caution.

One of the most prominent theorists to propose an alternate picture and
pair it with an aggressive pro-space weapons stance is Everett Dolman.
In his Astropolitik theory, Dolman summarizes the steps that the United
States must take to assume control of space, particularly through
withdrawal from the current space regime.66 This move, he argues, would
benefit not only the United States, but also the rest of the world,
since having a democracy controlling space is a catalyst for peace.67
Elsewhere, he writes: ''Only a liberal world hegemon would be able to
practice the restraint necessary to maintain its preponderant balance of
hegemonic power without resorting to an attempt at empire.''68
Accordingly, he believes that [this strategy would be
''perceived]{.underline} correctly [as an attempt at continuing U.S.
hegemony]{.underline},''69 **[but]{.underline}** that [[other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, correctly [assessing U.S. leadership in
space]{.underline}, [[would **not** seek to **deploy** their **own
systems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Having the ability to prevent the
stationing of foreign weapons systems in space]{.underline}, he writes,
''[makes the possibility of large-scale space war and]{.underline} a
military [space race **less likely**]{.underline}, not more.''70 In
fact, he says, ''to suggest that the inevitable result is a space arms
competition is the worst kind of mirror-imaging.''71 Dolman argues that
[the **[weaponization]{.mark}** of space [by the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [would ''**decrease**]{.mark} the [**likelihood** of
an **arms race** by **shifting spending**]{.mark} away [from
**conventional**]{.mark} weapons **[systems]{.mark}**]{.underline},''
[[which would]{.mark} reduce U.S. capabilities in territorial occupation
and]{.underline} would thus [[be perceived as **less
threatening**]{.underline}]{.mark} to other countries.72

One may ask, [just because the **U**nited **S**tates **unilaterally
refrains** from developing **a**nti**sat**ellite weapons]{.underline} or
space-based lasers, [why do we assume]{.underline} that [other countries
will pause right alongside Washington?]{.underline} After all, [**[not
all innovations]{.mark}** in war [stem from
**provocation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While weapons developed and
deployed by rival states surely influence decision making, [[it is
**unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[states procure weapons]{.mark}
systems **primarily** [to achieve]{.mark} a **[balance]{.mark}** in
**arsenals**]{.underline}. Some [states]{.underline} certainly may
strive to have what we have, but they also [will strive to acquire and
master]{.underline} those [weapons that meet their **unique security

[Washington's very reliance on
**sat**]{.underline}ellite**[s]{.underline}** for security, moreover,
[would appear to be a **more plausible motivation** behind]{.underline}
any hostile state's desire to acquire [satellite
countermeasures]{.underline}. [While China might wish to integrate ASATs
into its arsenal to offset Washington's]{.underline} deployment of
[ASATs]{.underline} as part of a deterrence strategy (\"you hit one of
mine, I'll hit one of yours\"), [[Beijing is **likely** to]{.mark} be
**more inclined** to [acquire **sat**]{.mark}ellite [countermeasures

[Washington]{.mark} does in order [to **degrade** **U.S.**]{.mark}
**space [advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which may be used to
support Taiwan]{.underline}.

[[To argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[states]{.mark} **must [follow
Washington]{.mark}** [and **deploy space weapons**]{.mark} out of
self-interest [is to **ignore**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the fact that
self-interest has many faces]{.underline}. In the end, [foreign
officials must weigh **[personal]{.mark}**, **[national]{.mark}**, and
**[party]{.mark} priorities**]{.underline} [[and **strategic
requirements**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [understand **[political
tradeoffs]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [assess
whether]{.underline} the national treasury and domestic
[[resources]{.mark} could support plans to \"match\" U.S.
weapons]{.underline}. Haiti's security needs will not match those of
Serbia, Iran's will not match Canada's, and India's will not match those
of the United States. Space control weapons, one must conclude, would
not fit very well in the defense strategies of many nations. [Foreign
leaders]{.underline}, in other words, [are **not
automatons**]{.underline}. Between action and reaction always lies
choice.

This [growing **dependence** on space]{.underline}, coupled [with the
increased]{.underline} awareness of the [**vulnerability** of **space
hardware**]{.underline}, has been [heightened by the dramatic upsurge in
the number of active satellites]{.underline}, particularly in Low Earth
Orbit (LEO)6. All of this has led to an increased focus on the space
surveillance and tracking capabilities to monitor both the passage of
traffic in the Earth orbital environment and to better understand and
identify behaviour in space operations that can escalate tensions
between countries7.

This discussion will advocate not only for openness and transparency in
the handling and dissemination of this data about space, but also that
[there should be an obligation to provide such **openness** and
**transparency**]{.underline}. [Such an approach is]{.underline} both
[vital to ensure a complete picture of **busy orbital paths** and is
**strategically desirable**]{.underline}. In addition to the Space
Situational Awareness (SSA) sharing agreement programme that is already
in place8 and the provisions of space-track.org, [States need to provide
as much information about the orbital environment as
possible]{.underline}, and this will include increasing investment in
space surveillance and tracking (SST) capacity.

[Increasing]{.underline} the amount and [**availability** of data will
allow the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
its allies to demonstrate **openness** and
**collaboration**]{.underline}. It will also be [possible to
use]{.underline} this freely available [information to **shine a light**
on behaviours that cause **international tension** and **threaten** the
**stability** of]{.underline} the [space]{.underline} environment. It is
not within the purview of this discussion to advocate specific
solutions - that is a much more extensive discussion9. Nor will it seek
to engage in a technical critique of existing provision for monitoring
the Earth\'s orbit. It is the core principle and the fundamental
legality underpinning the sharing of information that will be assessed.

This article will outline some of the definitional issues that can
obfuscate discussions on tracking space objects. The inquiry will then
examine the extant legal position as to the requirements for sharing
information about space objects. Following on from this will be a
critique of the current strategic position regarding the opaque aspects
of data and information sharing. The work will conclude by advancing the
creation of an overarching regime underpinned by data sharing that
provides for transparency of activity, greater provenance in the quality
of data and ways in which such a regime can embed security and positive
behaviour at its heart.

Understanding Space Situational Awareness

Throughout this discussion, several discrete functions regarding the
monitoring of the orbit of the Earth will be examined. A fundamental
starting point is the term Space Situational Awareness (SSA) itself, the
umbrella term for the pursuit of a complete understanding of the orbital
environment. [SSA aims to **characterize** the **space environment** and
activities in space]{.underline}10. In order to conduct the monitoring
of the orbital environment and the behaviour of the various actors, a
range of dedicated SST sensors (e.g., radar, optical, laser ranging)
acquire data on objects (e.g., active and non-active satellites, debris,
fragmentations, re-entries), which are then processed as part of a
catalogue.11 [Satellites operate in **different orbits**]{.underline},
and those orbits have other observational requirements; this [means that
data collection from a **variety** of sensors is
**required**]{.underline}12.

In essence, however, [the]{.underline} first and [most fundamental
aspect of SSA is acquiring **as much data** as possible]{.underline},
from the different orbital planes, [and from **as many sources** as
possible]{.underline}. As stated above, it is not the purpose of this
discussion to critique the current technical arrangements for
surveilling the orbital environment. It would, however, be remiss not to
point out that the dramatic increase in the number of space objects
being placed in orbit needs to be accompanied by an equally dramatic
rise in SST capacity if the datasharing provisions advocated herein are
to enjoy their full potential.

The acquisition of data from space is, however, only part of the
process. For the data to be of use, the tracking and sensing information
mentioned above needs to be analysed and combined with information about
the naturally occurring space environment - such as ambient space
weather conditions to produce warnings and collision avoidance advice13.
At present, the United States is recognised as having a hegemonic
position regarding both the physical hardware and the dedicated
resources for operating SSA. While the US's notion of domain situational
awareness can be traced back to World War II airspace,14 and the "first
formalized effort to catalogue satellites" occurred in the late
1950's,15 the modern genesis of today's construct was the establishment
in 1979 of the United States Space Defense Operations Centre to "command
and control the space surveillance network."16 It was founded amidst the
recognized needs to facilitate space surveillance, protect space systems
used for battle management, communications and intelligence, and prevent
hostile uses of space by adversaries.17

While the United States' focus on space surveillance understandably
waned after the fall of the Soviet Union and spiked in the aftermath of
China's 2007 destructive anti-satellite missile test18, the notion of
external sharing of SSA data can be traced to the 2004 National Defense
Authorization Act, which authorized the Department of Defence's creation
of a "pilot program for the provision of satellite tracking support to
entities outside the United States Government.19 This was codified into
an evolving statute,20 and laid the groundwork for today's robust SSA
sharing program.

A few years later, the program received additional impetus by then
President Barack Obama's 2010 National Space Policy21. In the stated
interest of preserving the space environment and encouraging the
responsible use of space, it directed the development and maintenance of
SSA using commercial, civil, and national security sources, the pursuit
of debris mitigation and removal measures, and collaboration;

"... \[with\] industry and foreign nations to maintain and improve space
object databases; pursue common international data standards and data
integrity measures; and provide services and disseminate orbital
tracking information to commercial and international entities, including
predictions of space object conjunction."22

These objectives have been restated in later policy documents, including
2018's Space Policy Directive-323 and 2020's National Space Policy.24
Currently, the United States through its Department of Defense has more
than 100 SSA Sharing Agreements with foreign governments, universities,
and commercial satellite operators, whereby Agreement holders receive
specialized "space information such as conjunction assessment, launches,
deorbits, and re-entry assistance."25 The stated purpose of the program
is to "foster openness, predictability of space operations, and
transparency in space activities."26 The Department of Defense tracks
more than 23,000 objects on-orbit and disseminates the information
through the public facing Space-track.org website.27 Agreement holders
share and receive additional detailed information, while any member of
the public can create a free account and obtain satellite catalogue,
positional, decay, and re-entry data.28

The information on space-track.org is freely accessible. Participation
and data sharing in the program is, however, on a voluntary basis. There
are no international treaties or other agreements which mandate the
provision of information. Similarly, there is no legal duty to provide
additional information. The delivery of information through this
voluntary mechanism is rooted in pragmatism and an attempt to provide a
basic level of service. The significant increase in active satellites,
particularly smaller satellites acting under shared control in large
constellations, means that the current provisions for both gathering and
sharing SSA information may well be shown up as inadequate. This
discussion will now go on to examine whether there is any legal duty
that could be relied upon to mandate an increase in SST capacity and the
subsequent sharing of any information gained as a result.

The [current legal framework]{.underline}: **[No duty to share
data]{.underline}**?

In order to establish the extent of the duty on nations to share
information, it is first necessary to explore the legal framework that
governs international activity in outer space. The [primary instrument
of international law which regulates national activity in outer space
is]{.underline} The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of
States in the Exploration Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and
Other Celestial Bodies, known colloquially as [the **O**uter **S**pace
**T**reaty]{.underline} (OST)29. This is a universal treaty opened for
signature in 1967. As with other international treaties30, the OST does
not provide the granular detail or \'rules of the road\' for actions in
space. Instead, it contains several foundational principles which shape
how Nation-States should conduct space activity. The OST grants certain
freedoms relating to these activities, which it then regulates by
specific limitations.31 [Throughout the Treaty are woven **aspirational
notions**]{.underline} that led the countries to create such a binding
instrument. These concerns are clearly articulated in the preamble to
the Treaty and highlight the need for space activity to be for peaceful
purposes and benefit all nations.

The [OST does not have any]{.underline} specific [mention of a duty upon
States to]{.underline} track their space objects, much less to [share
information]{.underline} about this tracking. This is, perhaps, not
surprising, as the Treaty was a product of the Cold War race to the Moon
and drafted at a time when there were only two nations, the USA and
USSR, launching a few objects into space.32 The resulting Treaty that
emerged was as much a security treaty as anything else,33 with the
prohibition of placement of nuclear weapons in space under Article IV
attracting most of the headlines at the time.34 Nonetheless, to ensure
the two superpowers did not look to restrict access of other countries,
Article I of the Treaty provides that all States are granted the right
to engage in scientific investigation in space and use or explore space.

There are now [concerns that as [Russia]{.mark} becomes more isolated
following]{.underline} its [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, it could
[[take]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[more **aggressive**]{.mark}
**[posture]{.mark}** [in the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia's
eastern border is only 90 kilometers across the Bering Strait from the
coast of Alaska.

VanHerck noted that [[25 percent]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**ross
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**omestic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roduct
[[comes from]{.underline}]{.mark} oil, minerals and other [**natural
[resources]{.mark}** extracted [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. "So [they absolutely [have]{.mark} a
**[vested interest]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}, [and
they]{.underline} also [[want to]{.mark} ensure that it is
**[secure]{.mark}** for their [efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Over the past several years, Russia has revitalized a dozen or so
military installations in the Arctic that had sat dormant after the Cold
War, said VanHerck. "Not only are they placing defensive capabilities
that they state are obviously for defensive purposes, they are putting
offensive capabilities into the Arctic," he said, including missiles
that could strike North America.

Russia formed the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command in December
2014 to coordinate efforts in the Arctic. Since then, DoD said in its
strategy document, Russia has gradually strengthened its presence by
creating new Arctic units, refurbishing old airfields and
infrastructure, and establishing military bases along its Arctic
coastline.

Russia also has been working to establish a network of air defense and
coastal missile systems, early warning radars and rescue centers, the
DoD strategy said. In February 2021, Russia launched the Arktika-M
satellite to monitor the climate and environment in the region.

The United States is also watching China's moves in the Arctic. "[[China
calls itself]{.mark} a **[near-Arctic nation]{.mark}** and [wants
to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} **[influential]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline} as well," said VanHerck.

Concerning U.S. capabilities, "I would assess that we're in the game
plan development," he told the House Armed Services Committee. "We're
not able to have the persistence that I need to compete day-to-day in
the Arctic."

Another looming concern for DoD is how climate change could impact U.S.
military infrastructure in the Arctic. The issue was investigated
recently by the department's inspector general, who concluded in a
report last month that DoD will need to invest billions of dollars to
make military installations in the Arctic and sub-Arctic more resilient
to climate change.

The IG evaluated Thule Air Base in Greenland and DoD's five military
bases in Alaska.

"Officials from all six installations identified current climate and
energy challenges, such as cracked runways, sunken foundations, and
multiple power outages," said the IG report. At most of these
installations, the "day-to-day focus was on reacting to immediate
problems or reducing risk to existing hazards, rather than planning for
future hazards."

The report said some construction projects at Army, Air Force and Space
Force installations are already being funded to support increased Arctic
operations.

MORE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

[There is a **[huge need]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [Arctic for
**reliable surveillance**]{.mark} [and **communications**]{.mark}
systems because **[miscommunications]{.mark}** could [trigger]{.mark}
**[unintended conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton
Hinote, deputy chief of staff for Air Force Futures, said at a Wilson
Center panel discussion.

"[[**Awareness** about]{.mark} [what is going on in]{.mark} [the
Arctic]{.mark} [is a **key part** of **preserving
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

For example, in military wargames, the "avenues of approaches over the
Arctic" for enemy missiles or bombers are a major concern. "The [Arctic
is the **shortest route** between our competitors and us]{.underline}."

The U.S. Air Force has operated in the Arctic for decades, Hinote said.
"But our [use of the Arctic as a strategic buffer is
**eroding**]{.underline} for all the reasons that have been talked
about, especially climate change, [and especially with]{.underline} some
of [the activities that we see Russia and China engaging
in]{.underline}."

[[As]{.mark} [the Arctic melts]{.mark}]{.underline},
"[[competition]{.mark} for **resources** and **influence** [in the
region]{.mark} [will **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

Hinote said the U.S. Air Force in recent years has intercepted and
warned away a growing number of Russian military planes flying near the
edge of Alaska's restricted airspace. These security concerns "drove our
focus on the Arctic and the release of a strategy."

Wargames organized by the U.S. military and allies typically have
focused on "countering great powers specifically in Europe and in the
Asia Pacific," Hinote said. "And one of the things that we felt like we
did not understand as well was how that competition would spill over
into the Arctic."

Live military exercises like NATO's Cold Response, NORAD's Operation
Noble Defender, and Northern Command's Arctic Edge are helping the U.S.
and allies "understand the nature of the competition," he said. The
submarine-focused Ice Exercise (ICEX) has been held since the 1960s,
making it the longest-running Arctic exercise.

To bolster the U.S. posture in the Arctic, the Air Force is stationing
54 F-35 advanced fighter aircraft at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.

"Alaska is an incredibly well-positioned base of operations for
defending the northern approaches to the United States, and this is why
so many of the intercepts that happen when an adversary's aircraft is
coming from the north are done with assets that are stationed in
Alaska," Hinote said.

The Department of the Air Force's [Arctic strategy]{.underline} also
[recommends greater use of space assets to support military]{.underline}
and homeland [defense efforts]{.underline}.

"[[Space capabilities]{.mark} are [**tailor-made** to support]{.mark} a
[region where]{.mark} [there is **sparse ground
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lt. Gen. William Liquori, deputy
chief of space operations for strategy, plans and programs for the U.S.
Space Force, said at the Wilson Center panel.

"The satellite command-and-control capabilities that we have at Thule,
those are there because military operations are going to happen in the
Arctic," said Liquori. "And that means we're going to need to have
satellite coverage in the Arctic."

To fill gaps in satellite communications coverage over the Arctic, the
Air Force worked out a deal with the Norwegian Space Agency subsidiary
Space Norway to launch two U.S. military communications payloads on
Norwegian satellites. The payloads, developed by Northrop Grumman, will
be integrated into the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission satellites,
projected to launch on a SpaceX rocket in 2023.

[[Any **Arctic strategy**]{.mark} [has to]{.mark} [consider]{.mark} the
**[importance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[space]{.mark}
domain**]{.underline}, said Mir Sadat, a nonresident fellow at the
Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not doing enough
to]{.underline} "[prepare for the **new frontier**]{.underline}." In
contrast, Russia and China, by increasing their activities in the
region, are positioning to one day take advantage of shorter sea lanes,
Sadat said. A key goal for China and Russia is to "reach global markets
or military targets faster and much more cheaply," he said.

[[Satellites to]{.mark} [watch what]{.mark} Russia and [others are
doing]{.mark} on the ground [is]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}nother
[**[critical capability]{.mark}** that [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates might [[need
to **expand**]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Scott Herman, CEO of Cognitive
Space.

The company participated in the recent Arctic Edge 2022 exercise as a
military contractor, orchestrating collection opportunities across
commercial satellite operators.

Today, many commercial remote-sensing constellations can't support
Arctic activities because they can't reach those high latitudes, said
Herman. But if the Arctic becomes a geopolitical flashpoint, "you may
see some adjustments to some of the satellite constellation plans to
make sure they've got sufficient northern exposure."

In its strategy, the Department of the Air Force said [there is a need
for]{.underline} "[domain awareness]{.underline} through new
technologies [ranging from over the horizon radar to space
assets]{.underline}."

FEARS OF 'MISCOMMUNICATION'

Michael Sfraga, chair and distinguished fellow of the Wilson Center's
Polar Institute, said an imminent war in the Arctic is unlikely.

"I think that's a low probability," said Sfraga, who is based in Alaska.
But he believes the risk will increase as countries step up activities.

"[The **[higher probability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, unfortunately, [is a
**[miscommunication]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [An exercise gone
wrong]{.underline}, a [missile fired by mistake]{.underline}, [Russian
bombers]{.underline} are [escorted]{.underline} out of our airspace [and
there's a miscommunication between pilots]{.underline}," he said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine now casts things in a different light, he
added. "No one thought something like Ukraine would actually happen. If
anybody would have told you 20 years ago that China would have built
islands in the South China Sea and claimed that territory, I would have
said that seems pretty far-fetched." The lesson for the United States is
to remain "vigilant and diligent."

It's well known that Russia derives a significant portion of its GDP
from natural resource development in the Arctic, Sfraga said. It's also
continuing to expand its military presence and capabilities in the
region. "China, which sometimes forgets that it's not actually an Arctic
state, is doing everything it can to establish its own influence in
Arctic governance and economic development."

"While there's no imminent threat of conflict in the Arctic, the
[**[increasing activity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[proximity]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} these [aggressive powers [requires]{.mark} the [U.S. to
maintain]{.mark} [situational awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} and
operational capacity," he said.

[The]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has to be
better prepared to operate in the Arctic]{.underline}, Sfraga said, [and
noted that [satellite]{.mark}-based service[s]{.mark} are **[sorely
needed]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the area.

"[[Satellite]{.mark} communications]{.underline}, imagery, all of those
things [are very [important to]{.mark} our]{.underline} national and
civil [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, search and rescue," he said.
"**[[There's just]{.mark} [limited]{.mark}
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

"**[[Presence]{.mark} [equals influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he
said. "[[Showing]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [adversaries that [you
can]{.mark}]{.underline} actually conduct operations and [protect
[your]{.mark} **own [interests]{.mark}** in]{.underline} a landscape
like [the Arctic [serves as a **deterrent**]{.mark}]{.underline} and is
incredibly important."

THE STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE GREAT POWERS

[**Optimists** would see]{.underline} the [opportunities for
**cooperation**]{.underline}. [History]{.underline}, however, [tells us
how **great powers**]{.underline} [have]{.underline} always [been
**protective of vital trade**]{.underline} [routes and in]{.underline}
[competition]{.underline} for natural resources, the sinews and
lifeblood of societies. Why would this be any different in the Arctic?
[Since all]{.underline} great [powers]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
certain **[strategic interests]{.underline}** in the Arctic, now that it
has become more accessible, [the **risk of tensions
increases**]{.underline}.

Russia is by nature an Arctic power: the Northern part of the country is
located within the Arctic circle. Their presence signals continuity
rather than change. However, in recent years, [there has been an
**increase**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} their **[military
presence]{.underline}** within the region. [The **revival**
of]{.underline} military [bases]{.underline}, [the expansion and
**modernization**]{.underline} [of Russia's]{.underline} Northern
[fleet]{.underline}, [the introduction of the]{.underline}
[first]{.underline} combat-ready [icebreaker]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the **[adaptation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
military [technology]{.underline} [and personnel]{.underline} to Arctic
conditions [are]{.underline} [only the]{.underline} [**most
significant** actions]{.underline} of the Kremlin. This military
presence serves several purposes, such as protecting economic
infrastructure, conducting search-and-rescue missions, etc. In terms of
security, the melting of Arctic ice is improving accessibility, but for
Russia this also means that their natural buffer is diminishing. Not
only that, but the increase of other states' interests sets off alarm
bells in Moscow. Large parts of the Arctic, together with the Northern
Sea Route and natural resources, are theirs, in their eyes, and they
would like to keep it that way.3

[China]{.underline}, through a scientific narrative, [has been **able to
establish**]{.underline} [itself]{.underline} in the region, [where they
have]{.underline} **[significant]{.underline}** economic and strategic
[interests]{.underline}, [even though]{.underline} [they are
located]{.underline} more than [1,500 km away]{.underline} from the
Arctic. [This distance]{.underline} also [means that their **security
interests**]{.underline} [are less **pronounced**]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, there are some. Other than more general interests, such as
scientific research, economic possibilities, and increased reach they
would have, Beijing has its own military interests, such as intelligence
and improved capabilities. [There are]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline}
[and US]{.underline} nuclear [strategic]{.underline}
**[submarines]{.underline}** [and **missile launch
facilities**]{.underline} [present in the]{.underline}
[region]{.underline}, [providing **first- and
second-strike**]{.underline} [capability]{.underline}. China knows this,
but because of their military absence they are mostly blindsided in
their Arctic intelligence. An increased presence would rectify this and
increase security, or at least the feeling of it, on the mainland.4
[Intelligence does not]{.underline} **[extinguish]{.underline}** [the
threat]{.underline} or risk, [but **diminishes the
uncertainty**]{.underline} surrounding it. Concerning improved
capabilities, the dual use of scientific expeditions needs to be taken
into consideration. Data collection provides the possibility for the
Chinese military to adapt to Arctic conditions. All this collection of
information slowly removes the Chinese veil of ignorance concerning the
Arctic.

Lastly, the US, although having territory in the Arctic, only recently
revived its policies toward the region, under Biden. This resurrection,
considering the US aspiration to stay the primus inter pares, is
necessary in the face of rising Russian and Chinese presence, because
that in itself is a problem.5 An added security risk is that US Arctic
capabilities have been absent in recent years, due to the domestic
political polarization, which is unacceptable for the superpower.
Militarily however, the US still reigns, which still provides several
advantages in relation to Russia and China. Adding to this is the fact
that the US is building a new fleet of icebreakers to replace the
previous, now outdated ones.

[Regarding the **EU**]{.underline}, [its]{.underline} military
**[incapability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} foreign [policy
**indecisiveness**]{.underline} [is **negative**]{.underline} [for
its]{.underline} great power [status]{.underline}. Thus, [any future
military]{.underline} [influence]{.underline} [would]{.underline} mostly
[be **indirectly manifested**]{.underline} [through
**NATO**]{.underline}. However, not fully located within the Arctic
(which is still better than China), the EU does have significant
strategic interests within the Arctic. The new shipping routes, climate
change, and the promotion of sustainability all hit close to home.
Furthermore, the fact that some EU Member States (Denmark, Finland, and
Sweden) also have territory within the Arctic means that it is both
subject to foreign as well as domestic politics. Therefore, European
influence on Arctic politics is substantial. The EU has proven time and
time again that it is a capable global security provider, and it is also
willing to pursue this role on the Arctic stage, which it has shown in
recent years.

HOW LIKELY IS POLITICAL CONFLICT IN THE ARCTIC?

A first aspect, when answering this question, is that [both **Russia and
NATO**]{.underline} [are **conducting**]{.underline} unprecedented
**[military exercises]{.underline}** within the Arctic, [which **give
rise** to]{.underline} **[political tensions]{.underline}**.
[They]{.underline} [are]{.underline} of course [within
their]{.underline} full [right to do so.]{.underline} From Russia's
side, Umka-2021, saw three nuclear submarines popping up through Arctic
ice for the first time, carrying forty-eight ballistic missiles. In
addition, a pair of MIG-31 aircraft soared through the skies and
exercised air-to-air refuelling.6 As already stated, Russia's presence
is to be expected, which does detract from the significance of this
exercise.

On the NATO side there is the exercise Cold Response 2022. This
Norwegian-led exercise focuses on air and sea defenses, which are
essential for an Arctic military presence and is a way of improving
general Arctic competence within the alliance. The relevance of this
operation can be seen in the impressive participation.7 Furthermore,
[the US has **invested heavily**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} military
[**equipment** for Arctic operations]{.underline}. [Both
sides]{.underline} [have]{.underline} already [heavily **criticized**
their]{.underline} **[counterparts]{.underline}**, [and
Moscow]{.underline} [considers]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**NATO
exercise** a **serious threat**]{.underline} [as it seeks]{.underline}
[to remain]{.underline} [the only]{.underline} military
[power]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Second, [combined]{.underline} [with these]{.underline} military
[exercises]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} strategic [interests of the
great powers]{.underline} and the rise in economic activity [**heighten
the risks** of **small hiccups**]{.underline} or political conflict
between states. [Incidents like **accidental collisions**]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} [becoming]{.underline} more **[likely]{.underline}**.
[The Arctic]{.underline} [is **getting crowded**]{.underline}. Great
powers historically pursue their own interests on their own terms.
Cooperation can be of help, but every great power wants to outline the
goals of this cooperation, which can prove conflictual. The increased
presence of the Arctic in National Security Strategies signals that
interest in the Arctic will only rise.

Third, several senior officials have already expressed their concerns
for future political tensions in the Arctic. In recent years Russian
minister of defense Shoigu noted the rising strategic and economic
attraction of other powers to the Arctic, potentially culminating in
conflict.8 Even Javier Solana, former High Representative for the Common
Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, saw the Arctic as a
place where tensions could be exacerbated, and instability heightened.9
Lastly, Michael Rühle, Head of the Climate and Energy security section
at NATO, notices the rise of political tensions surrounding the
Arctic.10 These references show the anxiety that lives inside
policymakers' minds.

Finally, there is an aggressive rhetoric upheld by Moscow in the way
they treat the Arctic, which can also be noticed today in the Ukrainian
war. Although the circumstances differ substantially, Moscow is becoming
more and more offensive in the way it relates to other Arctic countries.
Manifestations of this are the sea and airspace incursion conducted in
the Scandinavian countries. Next to that, the planting of a Russian flag
in 2007 on the seabed of the Arctic Ocean illustrates they claim more
than what is assigned to them.11 Just as with Ukraine, they see the
increased presence of the West as a threat to "Mother Russia" itself,
leading to a self-defense rhetoric, even though every Arctic state stays
within its territory. Thus, Cold Response 2022 is perceived by Russia as
menacing. The invasion of Ukraine has proven they are ready to act on
this rhetoric.

How is Russia's invasion in Ukraine linked with political tensions in
the Arctic? A first, recurring aspect, is that Russia's actions
regarding Ukraine have undermined their standing and confidence
internationally and have once again damaged cooperative relations for
the Arctic, since the other seven members have decided to "pause" the
work of the Arctic Council.12 This is 2014 all over again for
cooperation in the Arctic, but on a significantly larger scale. Beyond
the reputational damage states suffer if they would cooperate with
Russia in these times, there is a great loss of trust. Keeping in mind
that most interests align, apart from the military-strategic, this is
disadvantageous to all stakeholders. Adding insult to injury, Russia
currently holds the presidency of the Arctic Council, putting extra
stress on further cooperation. Seeing that the Arctic becomes ever more
relevant these are unfavorable times for Arctic governance.

[If cooperation **weakens**]{.underline}, [there is **more
room**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} miscommunication and even
**[miscalculation]{.underline}**, which is far worse. [With the Arctic
**receiving more attention**]{.underline} and [the]{.underline}
[Northern]{.underline} [Sea Route **opening**]{.underline} [the way
for]{.underline} large-scale **[seaborne transport]{.underline}**, [the
**increased traffic**]{.underline} [improves the **risk of
incidents**.]{.underline} Next to that there are recurring airspace
incursions from Russia. This could potentially spark misinterpretation
since the diplomats are currently not talking to each other. After 2014
military leaders in the Arctic had already stopped talking.13 Today,
this has gone one step further by stopping the work of the Arctic
Council -- an unprecedentedly strong move by the other seven members.

Furthermore, the invasion of Ukraine is a confirmation of the worries
surrounding Russia in the Arctic. There are concerns that Russia would
push for buffer zones within the Arctic, or that they would be on high
alert for any foreign action in "their" territory, maybe even cutting
off the Northern Sea Route, which would only increase the risk of armed
conflict. If they went as far as to wage war in Ukraine, who is to say
that they will not do so at their Arctic borders? This risk has also
pushed both Finland and Sweden closer to NATO, which is
counterproductive to Moscow, and has also ramped up discussions on the
modernization of defense systems in the Arctic within the US and
Canada.14 The military future and the potential for armed conflict in
the Arctic remains uncertain, but political tensions have definitely
increased.

CONCLUSION

To end on a more positive note, it is safe to say that all states
present in the Arctic have a high interest in avoiding any form of
conflict. However, we cannot ignore the largescale military build-up,
increased interest in the region, and the possible risks this brings.
Next to that, [the **Russian invasion** of Ukraine]{.underline}
[only]{.underline} **[adds fuel]{.underline}** [to the
Arctic]{.underline} [fire]{.underline}. [This means that]{.underline}
[all]{.underline} great [powers]{.underline}, [when
deciding]{.underline} [on an Arctic]{.underline} [strategy]{.underline},
[now]{.underline} [must take **each other's position**]{.underline}
[into close **consideration**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [also the
**possibility of future conflict**,]{.underline} be it political or
military. [The EU and NATO]{.underline} [have]{.underline} only
[recently]{.underline}, officially [**accepted** the **geopolitical
nature** of the Arctic]{.underline}. It is therefore disappointing to
see that the Strategic Compass greatly undervalues the strategic
relevance of the Arctic for the EU's security. Nevertheless, both
organizations need to stand tall against the backdrop of the invasion of
Ukraine, Russia's increased military presence, and China's increased
interest. Meanwhile, the Arctic remains a very underexposed area in
public and academic debate, but with the way things are going, this is
likely to change.

Over the past five years, [[Russia]{.mark} has [**moved aggressively**
to **build its Arctic military**]{.mark} **capabilities**]{.underline},
apparently [in an effort to secure its claims]{.underline} and interests
[in the region]{.underline}.1 Increasingly, human activity is occurring
in the Arctic as the sea ice recedes and economic opportunity opens to
nations via new shipping lanes. Characteristically, in any geographical
area, with the rise in human activity [there is]{.underline} also
[the]{.underline} corresponding [possibility that friction will
occur]{.underline} as people compete to exploit the natural resources
and corresponding economic possibilities. [Such
friction---and]{.underline} potential
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}---in the Arctic [[is **highly
likely**]{.underline}]{.mark} at some point **[[unless preparations are
made]{.mark} to mitigate it]{.underline}**. [Alaska makes the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [an Arctic
nation]{.underline}, and its location places the state and country at
the center of this fast-evolving region.2 Thus, [Alaska is critical
to]{.underline} the [national security]{.underline} of the United
States; however, [we are **not**]{.underline}, as a nation, [keeping
pace with the rapidly changing security situation in the Arctic.
**[Lagging]{.mark}**]{.underline} here [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[have an **enormous impact**]{.mark} **on our economy**]{.underline}.
To change this dynamic, there are several things that the U.S. military
can do to ensure the future security of the region. Alaska's
Geostrategic Importance "Alaska is the most strategic place on earth,"
stated Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell in testimony before Congress in 1935.3
The reason for this bold statement is that [Alaska is the
closest]{.underline} U.S. [location to the center of the Northern
Hemisphere]{.underline} (see figure 1). The state is singularly closer
to many national capitals in the hemisphere than most points in the
lower forty-eight states. [This makes Alaska the perfect **[power
projection]{.mark}** platform for the United States from a military
standpoint]{.underline}. Further, [because Alaska sits astride the
Bering Strait chokepoint and the Great Circle Routes]{.underline}
between North America and Asia as can be seen in figure 2, [it [is
**critical** to]{.mark} our **economic and national
[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 The air lanes and sea lanes of the
Great Circle Routes are heavily trafficked by shipping companies because
they shorten the distance between the two continents, saving time and
money for shippers. Consequently, the city of Anchorage and Alaska are
at the center of existing commercial shipping lanes between East and
West. Anchorage, at roughly the halfway point between the major commerce
centers of North America and Asia, is an important hub for such
international corporations as Federal Express and DHL.5 Moreover, many
nations such as China and Russia are routinely making use of these
routes for their economic benefit. However, while Alaska is critical to
intercontinental shipping now, emerging routes due to shrinking ice
impediments could raise the state's economic stature to even greater
heights. The retreat of ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean has opened up
the potential for shipping along the Northern Sea Route and the fabled
Northwest Passage (see figure 3).6 The Northern Sea Route parallels
Russia's Arctic coastline, as much of it is within the country's
exclusive economic zone. In the past few years, shipping along this
route has increased, topping out with seventy-one passages in 2013.7
Moving goods along this route cuts off thousands of miles, saving money
on fuel costs and insurance (since there are no pirates along this
route).8 Moreover, Russia is facilitating passages through the use of
its large icebreaker fleet, making her an indispensable player in
shipping through the High North while profiting from such transit by
charging fees for services akin to a toll.9 Thus, the emerging Northwest
Passage has recently become a possibility for shippers. For centuries,
explorers and adventurers sought a route from Europe to Asia across
Canada's High North. Most of these individuals failed in this attempt,
but now the dream is nearing reality. In 2017, the luxury cruise liner
Crystal Serenity made a trip through the Northwest Passage starting from
Seward, Alaska, and terminating in New York City.10 While much of the
Northwest Passage remains difficult to navigate due to remaining heavy
ice pack, continued ice retreat could make this route feasible in the
future. Alaska's position on the east side of the Bering Strait places
the state in a central position on the choke point of both routes.
However, with increasing human activity, it is inevitable that
disagreements among nations making claims in the area will arise as
competition heats up. Again, Alaska's location thrusts her to the
forefront of strategic calculations that the United States must make to
deal with emerging geopolitical and geoeconomic circumstances.
Incidentally, what makes the Great Circle Route good for shipping also
makes it the preferred route for the employment of missiles aimed at
North America. As previously noted, this route shortens the distance
between the two continents. Just as shippers prefer the route because
the reduced distance saves time and money, the same principle of
distance holds true for ballistic missiles. Potential adversaries could
fire weapons along this trajectory to close the distance more quickly
while lessening the potential for early warning to their attacks. Thus,
Alaska's location makes the state a critical component of the nation's
ballistic missile defense system. Arctic Natural Resources In addition
to the great potential for shipping through the Arctic, there is
considerable capacity for economic expansion based on the abundant
natural resources in the region. There are across the entire Arctic oil,
gas, coal, rare-earth metals, and fisheries. It is estimated that 13
percent of the undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the gas worldwide is
in the region, along with a host of other resources.11 As a result,
Arctic nations are very interested in tapping into these to facilitate
economic growth and generate revenue. The retreat of sea ice and glacial
melt is making these resources more accessible to Arctic and interested
near-Arctic nations like China. The desire to obtain this mineral and
energy wealth is stimulating competition among these countries. All of
the Arctic nations have made claims beyond their exclusive economic
zones on the outer continental shelf so that they have exclusive right
to exploit these resources (see figure 4). [[Claims]{.mark} are
made]{.underline} under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), which
then adjudicates them according to the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea. The problem is [that]{.underline} many of these claims
**[[overlap]{.underline}]{.mark}**, complicating the UN's ability to
judge in a manner satisfactory to all the claimants.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn [[gives rise to]{.mark}
**friction**]{.underline} among the nations as they increasingly
confront each other. [Herein lies the potential for **[conflict]{.mark}
in the Arctic region**]{.underline}, which has heretofore been known for
regional cooperation and peace. Sources of Conflict [The obvious source
for]{.underline} possible [conflict is]{.underline} the increasing human
contact and the [claims]{.underline} put forth by the various Arctic
nations. One nation making such claims in the Arctic region has made a
concerted effort to assert or expand its sovereignty in other areas of
the globe recently; that nation is Russia. The Russian Federation
already derives 20 percent of its gross domestic product from economic
activity in the Arctic, and its claims would expand its reach to make
further economic growth possible.12 Over the past five-plus years,
Russia has systematically embarked on a program to establish new or
refurbish abandoned military bases in the Arctic (see figure 4). The
reasons for this effort include providing protection to the emerging
Northern Sea Route and securing its economic interests. As already
noted, the Northern Sea Route has the potential to provide great benefit
to Russia through direct trade or the facilitation of trade between Asia
and Europe. Further, should Russia win its claims on the outer
continental shelf, it will control vast areas and resources to its
benefit.13 Thus, refurbishment and expansion of new bases is an effort
to secure what Russians believe is theirs. However, this gives rise to
the strong possibility of conflict if other nations do not accept
Russian claims. A reason for concern that [[Russia may **press**]{.mark}
**its [claims]{.mark}** even if the UN decides against it]{.underline}
is based upon recent developments in other regions. As we have seen over
the past four years, [Russia has aggressively pressed forward with
territorial claims]{.underline} in its "near abroad" at the expense of
Russia's neighbors.14 [Russia annexed Crimea]{.underline} from Ukraine
in a brazen land grab. Later, under the pretense of protecting ethnic
Russians, it fomented a war with Ukraine to seize territory on its
western border with Ukraine. Most recently, [Russia has intervened in
Syria]{.underline} on behalf of Bashar al-Assad's government to prop
that regime up to ensure its survival as well as to enable Russia to
gain access to new locations in Syria from which to stage both Russian
air and sea power in the Mediterranean Sea and Middle East. This raises
the question, [Would Russia move in a similarly aggressive manner to
establish military hegemony and control over much of the
Arctic?]{.underline} Mitigating the Risk of Conflict [Since, the Arctic
region is]{.underline} so self-evidently [important to the United
States]{.underline} both economically and militarily, [[we **must assert
ourselves** to ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the region remains
**[peace]{.mark}**ful [and]{.mark} is of benefit to all nations as part
of the **[global commons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, what can the U.S.
military do to ensure this outcome? First, we must ensure that we
maintain and sustain a credible force in Alaska. Much recent discussion
by senior political and military leaders has centered on cutting force
structure in Alaska.15 In particular, the Army has considered drawing
down the airborne brigade combat team posted at Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson. This would send the wrong message to potential
adversaries that the United States is not committed to protecting either
its own interests and claims, or Arctic security in general. This might
encourage aggressive actions on the part of nations, most prominently
Russia, seeking to seize and exploit opportunities within the Arctic
region. Second, [[U.S. forces **must exercise**]{.underline}]{.mark}
frequently [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} visibly to
[**[demonstrate]{.mark}** our [capability]{.mark} to secure our
interests [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such exercises should
include joint forces and incorporate combined operations with Arctic
partners. By conducting joint and combined exercises, we send a message
to potential adversaries that we intend to secure our interests and
those of our partners in the austere environment of the Arctic.
Moreover, combined exercises demonstrate the interoperability of our
forces with partner nations for a deterrent effect. Third, U.S.
[[military forces have to **regain**]{.mark} **Arctic [skills]{.mark}**
[to **enhance deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. There is
much work to be done. Over a decade of war focused on counterinsurgency
in the desert environment of the Middle East and central Asia has left
forces in Alaska with atrophied Arctic survival and tactical skills and
antiquated equipment. Further, [a major winter exercise in the Arctic
targeted at the operational level of war has not occurred in several
years. To have a **credible deterrence** to any nation's design for
expansion in the Arctic, the **U**nited **S**tates has to systematically
rebuild and demonstrate its Arctic skills]{.underline} and refurbish or
field new equipment to give U.S. forces in Alaska a robust capability to
challenge aggressors. Fourth, U.S. forces in the Arctic require
technological and equipment modernization. In the same way that Arctic
skills have atrophied over the past decade-plus, so also has the
equipment available to the force become either obsolete or difficult to
maintain due to age. For example, early-warning defense radar systems
require modernization as software becomes out of date and the purpose
for which they were designed has evolved. Additionally, ground mobility
suffers from an aged system that is difficult to maintain, making it a
challenge to move ground forces in deep snow or mud. The M973 Small Unit
Support Vehicle (SUSV) is not viable since it is no longer a program of
record, and a material solution is required to enable greater mobility
for ground forces in the Arctic. These are just two examples of
equipping needs among many. The bottom line is that U.S. forces will
require investment in materiel that facilitates operating in the tough
conditions of the Arctic. This is essential to demonstrate our
commitment to security in the region. Finally, in conjunction with
rebuilding Arctic forces' equipment and effectiveness, commanders in
Alaska need the authority to conduct military-to-military consultations
with counterparts around the region. We maintain this with most Arctic
nations through Alaskan Command's security cooperation line of effort.
However, in 2013, all consultations with Russia were curtailed. Lack of
regular contact with Russia continues to be a strategic gap that, with
increased competition as well as the already tense relations that
prevail between the two nations, could lead to misunderstandings and
miscalculations between the United States and Russia and potentially
result in needless conflict. Regular consultation with Russia needs to
be restored. The ability of commanders from U.S. Army Alaska and Alaskan
Command to consult with counterparts in Russia would go far to reduce
tension and assure clear communication between the two nations. This
simple step could go a long way toward ensuring peace in the Arctic.
[Conclusion]{.underline} The U.S. position in the Arctic because of
Alaska is of enormous strategic significance. [The United States has
vital interests in the **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} region that are
unfortunately often overlooked because turbulence in other areas of the
world often draw more attention. In time, [these interests
will]{.underline} come to [be]{.underline} seen as both [critical and
[**vital** to]{.mark} our]{.underline} own long-term [**economic
interests** as well as **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consequently,
[there is a need to ensure our interests in the Arctic are sufficiently
secured]{.underline} to ensure resolutions to territorial and resource
claims remain peaceful. To effect protection of our interests, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has
to **assert leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark} using critical elements of
national power, [including the military. We must rebuild]{.underline}
long-ignored Arctic military [capabilities [to **provide a**]{.mark}
**credible [deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} to any nation that may want
to expand its territory outside of recognized international norms to
exploit the tremendous resources of the Arctic. As human activity
continues to increase in the Arctic, it will become more and more
important for the United States to demonstrate its strength in the
region. [[Failure]{.mark} to do so [could allow]{.mark} the friction of
human interaction to grow into needless regional **[confrontation with
global implications]{.mark}**. This is preventable with]{.underline} a
commitment to [leadership and]{.underline} peace in the region that
stems from sufficient investment and [preparation]{.underline}.

[[In the Arctic]{.mark}, global [warming is producing]{.mark} a wholly
different sort of peril: **[geopolitical
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark} made possible by the melting of the
polar ice cap. [Before long, the Arctic [ice cap]{.mark} is expected to
**[disappear]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in summertime]{.underline} and to
shrink noticeably in the winter, [[making]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}
more [attractive for **resource**]{.mark} extraction]{.underline}.
According to the US Geological Survey, an estimated [[30 percent
of]{.mark} the world's [remaining]{.mark} undiscovered [natural
gas]{.mark} is above the Arctic Circle; [vast]{.mark} reserves of iron
ore, uranium, and [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}inerals are
also thought to be buried there. These resources, along with the appeal
of [faster **commercial shipping**]{.mark}]{.underline} routes [linking
Europe and Asia, have [induced **all** ]{.mark}**the [major
powers]{.mark}**, including China, to establish or expand operations in
the region. Russia has rehabilitated numerous Arctic bases abandoned
after the Cold War and built others; the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has done
**likewise**]{.underline}, modernizing its radar installation at Thule
in Greenland, reoccupying an airfield at Keflavík in Iceland, and
establishing bases in northern Norway.

[[Increased]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and **[[military
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the Arctic [has]{.mark}
significant **[nuclear implications]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [numerous
**[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[are deployed there]{.mark} and
**[geography]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[lends]{.mark} it a [key role
in]{.mark} many **[nuclear scenarios]{.mark}**. Most of Russia's
missile-carrying submarines are based near Murmansk, on the Barents
Sea]{.underline} (an offshoot of the Arctic Ocean), [and many of its
nuclear-armed bombers are also at bases in the region to take advantage
of the short polar route to North America. As a counterweight, the
Pentagon has deployed additional subs and antisubmarine aircraft near
the Barents Sea]{.underline} and interceptor aircraft in Alaska,
followed by further measures by Moscow. "I do not want to stoke any
fears here," Russian President Vladimir Putin declared in June 2017,
"but experts are aware that US nuclear submarines remain on duty in
northern Norway.... We must protect \[Russia's\] shore accordingly."

On the other side of the equation, an intensifying arms race will block
progress against climate change by siphoning resources needed for a
global energy transition and by poisoning the relations among the great
powers, impeding joint efforts to slow the warming.

With the signing of the Paris Agreement, it appeared that the great
powers might unite in a global effort to slash greenhouse gas emissions
quickly enough to avoid catastrophe, but those hopes have since receded.
At the time, Obama emphasized that limiting global warming would require
nations to work together in an environment of trust and peaceful
cooperation. Instead of leading the global transition to a postcarbon
energy system, however, the major powers are spending massively to
enhance their military capabilities and engaging in conflict-provoking
behaviors.

Since fiscal year 2016, the annual budget of the US Department of
Defense has risen from \$580 billion to \$738 billion in fiscal year
2020. When the budget increases for each fiscal year since 2016 are
combined, the United States will have spent an additional \$380 billion
on military programs by the end of this fiscal year---more than enough
to jump-start the transition to a carbon-​free economy. If the Pentagon
budget rises as planned to \$747 billion in fiscal year 2024, a total of
\$989 billion in additional spending will have been devoted to military
operations and procurement over this period, leaving precious little
money for a Green New Deal or any other scheme for systemic
decarbonization.

Meanwhile, policy-makers in [Washington, Beijing, and
Moscow]{.underline} increasingly [regard one another as]{.underline}
implacable and **[[dangerous]{.mark}
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "As China and Russia seek to expand
their global influence," then--Director of National Intelligence Dan
Coats informed Congress in a January 2019 report, "they are
[[erod]{.mark}ing once well-established [security norms and
increas]{.mark}ing the risk of **[regional
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Chinese and Russian officials have
been making similar statements about the United States. Secondary powers
like India, Pakistan, and Turkey are also assuming increasingly
militaristic postures, facilitating the potential spread of nuclear
weapons and exacerbating regional tensions. In this environment, it is
almost impossible to imagine future climate negotiations at which the
great powers agree on concrete measures for a rapid transition to a
clean energy economy.

[In a [world]{.mark} **constantly [poised for nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline} while facing widespread state decay from
climate disruption, [these]{.underline} twin
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} would **[intermingle]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[[intensify]{.underline}]{.mark}** each other.
Climate-​related resource stresses and disputes would
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the level of [global
discord]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [[risk
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [**nuclear [escalation]{.mark}**; the nuclear

Problem: Disrupted Connectivity in the Arctic

In the new era of great power competition, the [Arctic [nations]{.mark}
and observer states]{.underline} are already [[competing to
assert]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[influence]{.mark} across the
region]{.underline}.

[Reliable]{.underline}, [**resilient [connectivity]{.mark}** is
**[critical]{.mark}** to any military operation [in]{.mark} a [region
known for]{.mark} its **[remote nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}, harsh
climate, and atmospheric phenomena.

As the US NORTHCOM suggests: "[[Improving]{.mark} our **[domain
awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [communications systems]{.underline},
and our ability to conduct and sustain multi-domain operations [in the
High North are all **[important priorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}".

Specifically, the Arctic's extreme topography prevents the laying of
fibre networks by terrestrial communications providers while the
region's high latitude means armed forces can often find it more
difficult to link ground user terminals with Geostationary (GEO) Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites sitting over the Equator
and Mid Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites which reach no higher than +/- 52
degrees latitude.

Armed force also suffer from high levels in latency - a significant
challenge for units seeking to maintain the tactical advantage over near
peer adversaries operating throughout the region.

Additional challenges faced by armed forces operating in the Arctic
include atmospheric interference from solar and magnetic events which
can degrade high frequency (HF) signals.

Over the course of 2020/21, armed forces from across the Arctic Nations
continue to conduct joint exercise across the region, often aimed at
overcoming such restrictions in connectivity. Examples include the US
DoD-led Arctic Edge; ICEX; and Northern Edge exercises which provided
invaluable experience in terms of the planning and execution of
multi-domain operations in the region.

High capability, near peer [[adversaries]{.mark} including the People's
Republic of China]{.underline} (PRC) [and Russian
Federation]{.underline} also [[continue to]{.mark} be **[highly
active]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.mark}n Armed Forces]{.underline}, for example, [have
[conducted]{.mark} amphibious [landings on]{.mark} the
**[Chukotka]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Chukchi)
**[[Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}**, close to Alaska, [[in addition
to]{.mark} [anti]{.mark}-[sub]{.mark}marine warfare [operations]{.mark}
and the launch of anti-ship cruise missiles]{.underline} within the US
Exclusive Economic Zone.

Similar training programmes have been conducted on Alexandra Land with
Russian airborne forces inserted by parachute to clear and hold ground
with the support of layered air assets including strategic bombers.

As an Arctic Observer state, [the [PRC]{.mark} is]{.underline} also
[[emerging as]{.mark} an **increasingly** **[important]{.mark}
[stakeholder]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}, declaring itself a
"near-Arctic state". The [PRC's strategy includes building bilateral
relationships with Arctic Nations in addition to the establishment of
space-based capabilities]{.underline} including the 'Arctic Environment
Satellite and Numerical Weather Forecasting Project' which in the future
could support the command and control of ground and maritime forces in
the area.

"The [[escalation]{.mark} of Russian activity and Chinese ambitions in
the region [demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**strategic
importance** of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Competition
will only increase as sea ice diminishes and competition for resources
expands," the US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) understands.

[[NATO]{.mark} members [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} are]{.underline}
also [**[acutely aware]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [Russian and
Chinese]{.mark} [interests]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. [In

Significance of the Arctic

[The **Arctic**]{.underline} is the cold and remote wasteland north of
the 66.3° north latitude, commonly referred to as the Arctic Circle.1
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines the Arctic
Five, the nations with an Arctic coastal area and an exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) extending into the region.2 They include Russia, Canada,
Denmark (Greenland), Norway, and the US (Alaska).3 Iceland, Sweden, and
Finland are also considered Arctic nations but do not have an Arctic
coastal area. These eight nations constitute the members of the Arctic
Council and have special interests in the Arctic.4 The region's
considerable economic value in oil and gas resources, fisheries, and
minerals make it of interest to many nations beyond the Arctic Council.5

These [resources]{.underline} [have **long been
unavailable**]{.underline} [for **exploitation**]{.underline} due to ice
coverage, [but]{.underline} their **[growing
accessibility]{.underline}** [brought on by]{.underline} [**climate
change** is making the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline} even **[more
valuable]{.underline}**. Surveys estimate that 13 percent of the world's
undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of undiscovered gas reserves
reside in the Arctic.6 Until recently, the Arctic's minerals, oil, and
natural gas liquids have been inaccessible due to harsh conditions.
However, the declining Arctic ice has opened up access to areas where
these resources are located, and more extensive sea areas for fisheries
are now reachable.7 Also, the retreating ice opens up previously closed
sea lines of communication.

The Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route are open for more
extended periods, transporting merchandise from the Pacific to the
Atlantic free from piracy activity and faster than the traditional
routes through the Suez or Panama Canal.8 At the same time, the
increasing availability of resources presents several problems.9
Although most disagreements regarding maritime boundaries have been
resolved peacefully, a more "complicated disagreement involves the North
Pole itself."10 Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Russia claim ownership
of the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater ridgeline that extends well into
the central Arctic.11 [The issue is **unsettled**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} a possible **[source of conflict]{.underline}**---but
it has been solely a diplomatic one.12 Naturally, as Arctic nations,
Russia and the US are interested in the Arctic region due to its
resources and vital strategic points. [The **increased potential** for
**economic gain**]{.underline} [and **military-strategic**]{.underline}
[advantage]{.underline} has [made the Arctic]{.underline} [an **arena
for strategic competition**]{.underline} [and has led to]{.underline}
[an **increased military**]{.underline}, civil, [and **commercial
presence**]{.underline} from both nations. In particular, Russia has
"gradually reintroduced army, navy and air force elements into the
region," expanding its military footprint in the Arctic.13

[**Russia** is the **only nation**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}
Arctic **[Council]{.underline}** [that is **not a NATO
member**]{.underline} or partner.14 Russia has the largest Arctic
population, with more than 2 million citizens living north of the Arctic
Circle.15 Russia also generates 22--30 percent of its gross national
product (GNP) from the Arctic.16 Because of the melting ice and changing
Arctic environment, Russia is "optimistic about the potential for
Siberia and the Russian Far East" to significantly boost the nation's
economy.17 Energy projects and faster shipping between Asia and Europe
because of the Northern Sea Route will increase the need for supporting
ports and infrastructure. Building and maintaining this infrastructure
will be a potentially positive economic revenue for the nation.18 [The
**economic potential** has]{.underline} [**intensified**
Russia\'s]{.underline} [interest in **protecting** its]{.underline}
Arctic [assets through]{.underline} a **[heightened military
presence]{.underline}**. [Signs of this]{.underline}
**[interest]{.underline}** [include]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline}
[**reopening** of **abandoned**]{.underline} military
[installations]{.underline} [and more "**incursions**]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} Russian **[aircraft]{.underline}** [and
**submarines**]{.underline} into or [close to other]{.underline}
\[nations'\] **[Arctic spaces]{.underline}**."19 The planting of a
Russian metal flag under the ice at the North Pole by a Russian
submarine crew in 2007 shows that a greater military presence may have a
secondary purpose.20 President Putin has demonstrated a will to use
illegal aggression and violate international law to seize territory in
Europe.21 Russia may intend to contest the economically and
strategically important region and likely make claims for ownership and
economic rights in the Arctic that extend beyond the 200-nautical-mile
EEZ. Similarly, China has shown increased interest in the Arctic region.

[An **exciting aspect**]{.underline} [of the Arctic]{.underline} and
strategic competition [is **China's claim** to be a **near-Arctic
state**]{.underline}.22 [China's]{.underline} 2018 [Arctic
**strategy**]{.underline} [outlines a "**Polar Silk Road**]{.underline}
[economic plan]{.underline}."23 [China sees the **shorter
distance**]{.underline} from China to Europe [through the **Northern
Route**]{.underline} [as a possible **"economic boom."**]{.underline}24
[It has also invested]{.underline} [**heavily** in]{.underline} energy
[projects in Russia]{.underline} [and **does not hide**]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} [desire]{.underline} to access Arctic natural
resources.25 China's investments in ports, airports, research stations,
and satellite ground stations are reasons to raise concerns about its
intentions in the "autonomous territory" of the Arctic.26 China is also
developing a "constellation of twentyfour polar observation
satellites."27 The first satellite, launched in September 2019, has
already delivered over 2,500 pictures covering the Arctic and
Antarctic.28 China's increased activity and interest in the Arctic
confirms the Arctic as a new ground for strategic competition between
Russia, China, and the US.

The Arctic has risen as a new arena for strategic competition and a
region of increased interest for other stakeholders with economic
motives. The unfortunate consequences of its environmental changes are a
potential increase in natural resource exploitation and new
transportation lines. This new paradigm affects commercial, civil, and
military operations and has increased the strategic value of all Arctic
and near Arctic countries.

The corresponding threats to the area are significant. In fragile
regions like the Arctic, an accident from oil drilling or shipping would
have dire consequences. Continued environmental change might also impact
the wildlife and fisheries in the area, and further research and
surveillance are critical. A conflict in the area leading to the use of
arms may have the same effects. [The vast amount of]{.underline}
**[international waters]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**disputed
rights** to resources]{.underline} may [**lead to conflicts**
between]{.underline} **[Arctic nations]{.underline}** [and
other]{.underline} stakeholder[s]{.underline} [claiming their
rights]{.underline} to exploit the region. Increased activity has
"fueled a demand for communication, navigation, and surveillance
infrastructures."29 In the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region,
President Barack Obama recognized the Arctic as "an amazing place" where
climate changes represent emerging opportunities and "very real
challenges."30 These challenges are multifaceted, and many of them fall
under the purview of the Department of Defense.

Artic Strategies

US Artic Strategy

Since the US bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, it has been an Arctic
nation and is currently one of the Arctic Five and a member of the
Arctic Council.31 In Alaska, permafrost dominates the northern third of
the state, making regular settlements challenging.32 Less than 68,000
Americans live in the Arctic, and Alaska produces only 0.3 percent of
the US GNP.33 Mineral production in Alaska constitutes about four
percent of US mineral production.34 Nevertheless, the Arctic is vital to
US geostrategic interests.35 As the Arctic as a "geostrategic buffer is
eroding" and strategic competition in the area is increasing, the US
needs a comprehensive US military strategy for the region.36

The DOD's 2019 Arctic strategy expands on the complex security
environment in the region. It recognizes the security threat emerging
from increasing access to resources, an uncertain strategic environment,
and the fragile but still enduring cooperation in the region.37 The DOD
established three main objectives for the Arctic: defend the homeland,
compete when necessary to maintain favorable regional balances of power,
and ensure common domains remain free and open.38 The DOD acknowledges
the Arctic as an increasingly vital region due to strategic competition
and greater access to the region and its resources. This focus gives the
Air and Space Forces a direction for an Arctic strategy.

The Department of the Air Force views the Arctic as "residing at the
intersection between the U.S. homeland and two critical theaters,
IndoPacific and Europe, \[thus making\] the Arctic . . . an increasingly
vital region for U.S. national security interests."39 The Air Force's
Arctic Strategy also recognizes the "Arctic as a region of strategic
opportunity for the Air and Space Forces, Joint Force, allies, and
partners."40 The strategy builds around four lines of effort:
maintaining vigilance through command, control, communications,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C3ISR); projecting power
through bases in Alaska and Greenland; cooperating with allies and
Arctic partners; and finally, preparing through training, research, and
development.41 Allied and partner cooperation is emphasized throughout
the strategy. The strategy recognizes space as a solution for the
challenges in the demanding Arctic operating environment. The Space
Force must overcome the region's unique orbital and electro-magnetic
obstacles that negatively affect all communication and navigational
signals.42

Norway's Arctic Strategy

As one of the eight nations in the Arctic Council and one of the five
nations with an Arctic coastline, Norway has extensive interests in the
Arctic. Approximately 10 percent of its population---a greater
proportion than any other Arctic country---or half a million Norwegians
live north of the Arctic Circle.43 Key industries in North Norway such
as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism depend on natural resources.44 It
is estimated that more than half of Norway's undiscovered oil resources
are in the Arctic region.45 The Norwegian political vision for North
Norway and the Arctic region is economic, environmental, and social
sustainability.46 Arctic policy goals focus on international cooperation
and international legal order to achieve peace, stability,
predictability, value creation, and ecosystem-based management.47 The
five priority areas in the Arctic strategy are international
cooperation, knowledge development, infrastructure, environmental
protection and emergency preparedness, and business development.48 These
priorities are essential for the development in the Arctic region and
coincide with US policy and strategy for the region. Due to the Gulf
Stream, Norway is ice-free in the summer and has no permafrost. Without
the Gulf Stream, the average temperature in Norway would be 10 to 15
degrees Celsius colder.49 Although the latitude is similar to Alaska's,
Norway's climate is friendlier to human activity.

NATO's Arctic Strategy

NATO also understands the Arctic's strategic importance, particularly in
light of environmental changes, but has failed to develop an Arctic
strategy that incorporates the Arctic's unique challenges. The rapidity
of change "suggests the Arctic is likely to be one of the twenty-first
century's most contested areas."50 The current strategic concept of NATO
is "active engagement, modern defense."51 Collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security are core tasks, and deterrence
"remains a core element" of NATO's strategy.52 In developing an Arctic
strategy (excepting the operational plan), "NATO lags significantly
behind" Russia and China.53 An increased Russian military presence and
Russia's enhanced weapons available for anti-access and area denial
(A2/AD) in the gap from Greenland to Iceland to the United Kingdom
(GIUK) and northbound represent a major strategic problem for some of
the alliance's Arctic members.54 Unfortunately, not all NATO nations,
and not even all NATO Arctic nations, have the same viewpoint.55 An
intensified focus on the Arctic from the US and Norway may shift NATO's
focus toward the north. However, currently, there is no NATO Arctic
strategy other than deterrence and cooperative security.

The Significance of Space as the Solution

[The **obvious solution**]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} unique
[**infrastructure challenges** in the Arctic is
**space**]{.underline}.56 Commercial satellite services can support the
need for increased communications, surveillance, and understanding of
events in the region while also increasing cooperation between nations
and partners. [The use of **space assets**]{.underline} and space-based
infrastructure [is **not without challenges**]{.underline}. However, [by
"**optimizing**]{.underline} existing and [future]{.underline}
space-based **[infrastructure]{.underline}**, [using **low**
Earth,]{.underline} [**geo**synchronous]{.underline}, [and **highly
elliptical** orbits]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can work
**cooperatively**]{.underline} [with other **Arctic
nations**]{.underline} [to build]{.underline} **[situational
awareness]{.underline}**, enhance operations, and strengthen a common
rule-based order."57 Continued research and information sharing in a
region formerly neglected due to the harsh environment should be the
preferred measure to solve these issues.

Space Strategies

US Space Strategy

The 2020 National Space Policy of the United States of America declares
that "the United States will continue to use space for the nation's
security and our allies," continuing the high focus on allied
cooperation, involvement, and protection from the US Arctic strategy.58
Among the many goals of the policy, "lead, encourage, and expand
international cooperation," and "preserve and expand United States
leadership . . . \[working\] with likeminded international and private
partners" also confirm this focus on allied and partner cooperation.59
The policy explicitly calls for assured access to space; enhanced
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT); and the development of space
professionals as foundational activities.60 Furthermore, the policy
defines national security guidelines. In addition to recognizing space
as a war-fighting domain, it emphasizes "robust space domain awareness
of all activities in space with the ability to characterize and
attribute potentially threatening behavior" as an essential tool.61 The
policy focuses on "advanced technologies, capabilities, and concepts
that anticipate and rapidly respond to changes in the threat environment
and improve timeliness and quality of intelligence and data to support
operations." It also tries to "integrate cybersecurity into space
operations and capabilities" and "collaborate with allies and partners
actively engaging in space security and intelligence operations . . .
for the exchange of relevant space and space-related information."62
Additionally, this policy instructs the secretary of defense (SecDef )
to defend the US and its allies, protect freedom of navigation, defend
space assets while supporting joint operations, and use space to deter
conflict and defeat aggression. Other SecDef responsibilities include
providing affordable and timely space access; developing rapid launch
options; detecting threatening space behavior; conducting strategic
space posture reviews; and developing, acquiring, and operating space
intelligence capability to support joint operations.63 Allied
cooperation and defense are vital to accomplishing these tasks.
Likewise, the 2020 Defense Space Strategy emphasizes allied cooperation.

The Defense Space Strategy defines the objectives of "maintain\[ing\]
space superiority; provid\[ing\] space support to national, joint, and
combined operations; and ensur\[ing\] space stability.64 The space
strategy defines some lines of effort: "build a comprehensive military
advantage in space; integrate military spacepower into national, joint,
and combined operations; shape the strategic environment; \[and\]
cooperate with allies, partners, industry, and other U.S. Government
departments and agencies."65 Some specific objectives are to improve
intelligence and command and control capabilities; develop capabilities
to counter the hostile use of space; integrate allies into plans; and
expand cooperative research, development, and acquisition with allies
and partners.66 As with much of US military strategy, the document
focuses on strategic competition with China. But the strategy also
recognizes Russia as a threat. As the Arctic nation with the most
citizens north of the Arctic Circle, Russia is also a threat to US
security in the Arctic region extending into space.67

The Department of the Air Force Arctic Strategy notes that satellite
communications and data links are major C3ISR improvements in the area
while recognizing that space assets "reduce the need for a physical
footprint in the demanding Arctic operation environment."68 Another
high-focus topic in the strategy is "all-domain awareness" and the
accompanying challenges of "unique orbital mechanics" and
"electromagnetic obstacles" in the region.69 The strategy also
emphasizes allied cooperation, the development of new technology to
"ensure access to and freedom to operate in space," and the need to use
space capabilities to "mitigate and predict environmental disturbances
unique to the Arctic Region."70 Norway's space strategy, like that of
the US, emphasizes international cooperation.

Norway's Space Strategy

[Although Norway]{.underline} [is **not a large** nation]{.underline} in
geographical terms or population, [it is an **essential**]{.underline}
[and **experienced**]{.underline} space [nation]{.underline}. Situated
as it is in the High North, Norway is an Arctic nation. [It is a
**technologically developed** nation]{.underline} [that
**emphasizes**]{.underline} research and development in many
[**space-related** areas]{.underline}.71 Norway's space strategy, last
updated in 2019, presents four goals for Norwegian space operations.
These are promoting profitable businesses, growth, and employment;
ensuring crucial needs for society and the population; ensuring adequate
security for an essential space infrastructure; and securing Norwegian
foreign policy, security, and defense policy activities and operations
in space.72 Prioritizing the user's end needs leads to multisector
solutions requiring cooperation between government agencies, commercial
interests, and international entities.73 International cooperation is a
key focus area for environmental surveillance, security and
preparedness, research and education, and military use of space.74
Bilateral agreements and commercial cooperation will enhance the
Norwegian military's capacities.75

[Norway's **ambition**]{.underline} [to be the "NATO in]{.underline}
[the North"]{.underline} [creates]{.underline}
**[responsibilities]{.underline}** [to develop]{.underline}
**[space-based services]{.underline}** in the Arctic, [an area of **high
strategic significance**]{.underline} for Norway.76 At the same time,
[Norway has **ambitions**]{.underline} [of being]{.underline}
[independent]{.underline} in critical security sector services.77 [Due
to its **global dependence**]{.underline} [on space]{.underline}
[infrastructure]{.underline}, [Norway's **territory**]{.underline} in
the Arctic (e.g., Svalbard and Bjoernoeya) and Antarctic (e.g., Queen
Maud's Land) [increases its **geostrategic
significance**]{.underline}.78 As the Kongsberg Satellites Services'
station SvalSat on Svalbard exemplifies, these areas are favorable for
ground stations.79 Norway will work in multilateral and bilateral
processes to ensure Norwegian and allied security and freedom to use
space.80 Traditionally, the US and Norway have cooperated on space
activities. One recent example is the Rimfax radar developed in Norway
and carried by the Perseverance rover on Mars.81

The Norwegian Armed Forces Space Department was established in 2016 to
integrate 'the space activities of Norway's armed forces in an
operational domain.82 The department will strengthen the strategic
development, coordination, and leadership of military space
operations.83 The new long-term plan for the armed forces through 2024
confirms the military focus on space operations. Maritime surveillance,
communications, command and control, space domain awareness (SDA), and
cooperation with allies and commercial actors are focus areas.84 There
is a broad understanding of space as a war-fighting domain and the need
for including space in strategy development.85 SDA is a capacity
relevant for NATO contribution and a prioritized national focus area and
therefore aligns with NATO's strategy.86

NATO's Space Strategy

NATO established space as a new operational domain in 2019 when alliance
members adopted NATO's space policy.87 In October 2020, the NATO Space
Centre at Allied Air Command in Ramstein, Germany, was established. The
center will coordinate allied space activities, support NATO missions
and operations such as communications and satellite imagery, and protect
allied space systems.88 NATO will not put weapons in space but will
procure all products from NATO allies.89 The alliance will not become an
autonomous space actor.90 Some essential military space functions to be
provided to NATO include SDA, satellite imagery, PNT, and
communications.91 NATO's demand for space support aligns with US and
Norwegian strategic focus areas regarding space assets and support in
the Arctic.

Topics of Cooperation

The US and Norway may have different goals and motivations for their
Arctic and space strategy efforts. These differences are natural since
the US is a great power while Norway is a smaller nation with political
and cultural ties to the US and Russia. Norway's neighbor brings
strategic competition to Norway's doorstep, strengthening relations
between Norway and the US. Although the two countries may have separate
reasons for their interest in the Arctic and their strategy rationales
may differ, their activities to achieve these goals often align. The
coinciding lines of effort and focus areas for the two nations establish
common grounds for cooperation.

First and foremost, cooperation is the common ground for the described
policies and strategies, and it is the foundation for all other topics
discussed in this article. [Norway and the US]{.underline} [have
already]{.underline} [established]{.underline} [a
**unique**]{.underline} cooperative **[relationship]{.underline}** [in
some of these areas]{.underline}. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, [**better
cooperation** and **awareness**]{.underline} [of the
potential]{.underline} [advantages]{.underline} of joining forces [may
lead to **even greater**]{.underline} [gains]{.underline} for both
nations. Not limited to just the Arctic region, [**SDA** is one of the
**most critical areas**]{.underline} [where both countries]{.underline}
[can **cooperate**]{.underline}. The following table summarizes lines of
effort and strategies for the US, Norway, and NATO. \*\*\*TABLE
OMITTED\*\*\*Space domain awareness is a primary strategic goal for the
two nations and NATO. Norway's GLOBUS radars, located in Vardo in
northeastern Norway, have provided space situational awareness for
Norway, the US, and NATO since 2001.92 The system will be further
improved after completion of the Globus III radar, a joint project of US
Air Force Space Command and the Norwegian Intelligence Service.93 The
system is planned to be operational in 2022.94 The radar site's primary
missions are surveilling, tracking, and categorizing objects in space;
surveilling Norwegian interest areas in the north; and collecting
research and development information.95

This cooperation and joint effort exemplify how Norway, a relatively
small military space nation, can contribute to the space domain to
benefit all NATO nations. Norway's geographic position and relatively
mild climate make the operation possible within the Arctic region. With
the Arctic becoming the new area of competition and congestion, Norway
is positioned to become a critical player in the arena.96 Like space
domain awareness, communication is an essential area of cooperation.

Communications

Secure, [**reliable** communication]{.underline} in the Arctic [is
**vital**]{.underline} for any operation--- military, civilian, or
commercial. [Communication **between units** operating in the
Arctic]{.underline} area and back to their command organizations [is
**essential** for]{.underline} **[c]{.underline}**ommand
**[and]{.underline}** **[c]{.underline}**ontrol. [US]{.underline} and
Norwegian armed [forces need **broadband**]{.underline} network and
voice capability. In a remote area like the Arctic, where "fiber optic
infrastructure is scarce or nonexistent," [communication **via
satellites** is the **only viable solution**]{.underline}.97 An
increased US presence and a sustained presence from Norwegian
forces---all with the same communication, command, and control
demands---make satellite communication a perfect example of another area
of needed cooperation between nations and between government and
civilian actors.

Communications services in the Arctic are provided mainly by satellites
in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), with a limited coverage above 75°-
80° north.98 Fixed users may have broadband service up to 80° north, but
the very small aperture terminals (VSAT) only cover up to 75° north.99
Iridium NEXT's low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation is the only
mobile satellite service provider with proper coverage in the polar
region.100 Like Kepler and Argos, a few other companies provide LEO
connectivity, but none provide near-real-time broadband service.101
Communications in the Arctic area need improving to meet the increased
requirements for the allied military presence there.

The US and Norway are already working together to upgrade
communications. They are involving government and commercial entities
and combining international, cross-sector, and dual-use cooperation. For
example, InMarsat plans to launch two satellites in a highly elliptical
orbit (HEO) in 2022.102 They will provide continuous high-speed mobile
broadband coverage above 65° north and work in conjunction with
Inmarsat's 13 GEO satellites.103 The Norwegian Defense Department will
share the cost with the US Air Force and Inmarsat.104 The satellites
will be available for merchant fleets, fishing vessels, and other
commercial actors and provide tactical and strategic communication for
government customers.105 They will improve broadband coverage for US and
Norwegian military forces in the area but may not deliver a satisfactory
amount of data transfer in the event of a conflict.

Norway's ambition of being independent in providing critical services
for security issues combined with its emphasis on international and
bilateral agreements shows the desire for government- or
allied-controlled assets. Although Inmarsat is a UK-based company,
future commercial sales or changes in the company structures might
threaten the Norwegian military forces' access to the service or render
null the possibility of secure and classified communications. China and
Russia are investing in and buying European companies. Recently, a
Russian-controlled company attempted to buy a Norwegian Rolls Royce
engine maker.106 However, the Norwegian government has temporarily
stopped the sale due to security issues.107 To depend solely on a
commercial actor reduces the service's reliability in times of crisis,
making increased governmental cooperation even more critical. A
government controlled and operated tactical and strategic initiative is
needed to cover the US's and Norway's increased demand for high-speed
communications in the Arctic. The planned ViaSat Link 16--capable LEO
satellite is an example of a system under US and Norwegian government
control.108 Bringing Link 16 from a line-of-sight to
beyond-line-of-sight system would improve the situational awareness for
all on the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of a conflict.109
As an Arctic nation, Norway should invest in this constellation to
ensure a speedy development to achieve timely and secure communications
in the Arctic for all Norwegian and allied forces. Norway is well
positioned for cooperation regarding uplink and downlink through already
established capabilities and can bring this capability into the
cooperative effort. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
is another area of cooperation that should be emphasized and increased.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

[Space is **integral** to **ISR operations**]{.underline} [because it is
the **vehicle**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the provision of [any
usable]{.underline} **[situational awareness]{.underline}** in the
Arctic region. [The Arctic's properties]{.underline}---**[large, dark,
and remote]{.underline}** with unhospitable weather--- [make conducting
ISR operations]{.underline} [from space the]{.underline}
**[preferred]{.underline}** and most likely the only viable
[solution]{.underline}. As Norway's space strategy states,
[environmental **surveillance is critical**]{.underline}.
[Understanding]{.underline} [the **Arctic environment**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[determining]{.underline}** how and [when it will
change is a]{.underline} **[precursor]{.underline}** [to **avoiding
potential conflict**]{.underline}. Dual-use assets for environmental
surveillance have a military potential as well.

Norway has a long history of maritime surveillance of the sea in the
Norwegian area of interest. Through NorSat-1 and NorSat-2, the Norwegian
Coastal Administration uses the Automatic Identification System (AIS)
that all ships above 300 gross tons have been required to have since
2010.110 The new NorSat-3 enhances AIS surveillance with an experimental
navigation radar detector (NRD).111 The NorSat satellites are in
sun-synchronous orbits and also have additional scientific purposes such
as surveillance of solar radiation and space weather.112 They thus
provide cross-sectorial (commerce and defense sector) and dual-use
(surveillance and scientific) capabilities. These satellites, combined
with the coastal radars in Norway, are a vital surveillance source for
Russian military ac- tivity in the Barents area. Satellites in polar LEO
orbit will help track ships in Norway's exclusive economic zone and
detect ships operating in the Arctic region.

Norway is also developing new, exciting technological solutions that
could improve ISR capabilities environmentally and militarily. At the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, a team of
students and professors is working on a satellite with a hyperspectral
camera, an intelligent onboard processing computer, and robotics.113 The
onboard camera can be slewed and provides images of small areas of
interest.114 [The **Norwegian**]{.underline} company Kongsberg Satellite
Service (**[KSAT]{.underline}**) [has **contracted**]{.underline} [with
the university]{.underline} [to provide]{.underline} ground
[support]{.underline} that will enable the satellite to download images.
Also, short revisit times due to its LEO orbit will allow the satellite
to detect algae that is dangerous to salmon farming companies. [The
**satellite's information** can be]{.underline} [**transferred** to
"unmanned]{.underline} [vehicles]{.underline} [that can
**investigate**]{.underline} the [areas]{.underline} of interest
further."115 This technology could be developed and proved helpful in
detecting images other than underwater algae, particularly submarines.
Norway is close to the Kola Peninsula and Kola Bay, the Russian Northern
Fleet's home base.116 An ISR satellite [combined]{.underline} with an
unmanned aerial [system]{.underline} deploying active sonar and
confirming the satellite's findings [will give the US,]{.underline}
Norway, [and NATO]{.underline} [greater]{.underline} situational
**[awareness]{.underline}**. In addition to environmental surveillance,
increased weather surveillance and forecasts are needed.

Any party with interest in the Arctic must consider the punishing
weather conditions that can affect the safety of humans and machines.
The US Space Force (USSF) is "considering future investments to improve
weather monitoring in the Arctic."117 Climate change, not only in the
Arctic, requires "more timely and more precise data."118 Norway's
interest in research on environmental changes and improved weather
forecasting aligns with the DOD and USSF's need for an updated weather
satellite program, especially in the Arctic. By working cooperatively,
the US and Norway stand to gain in everything from technology research
to the employment of new space assets. Improved sensors reduce cost and
improve capabilities. Polar weather satellites with an up-down link
every 90 minutes via SvalSat---and distributed via high-speed broadband
satellite--- would make weather data available to many users, including
commercial traffic and decision-makers in both countries.

Understanding the magnitude and speed of environmental changes in the
Arctic is essential for resource conservation and situational awareness
of potential strategic impacts. According to SpaceNews, a USSF spokes-
person confirmed that the Space Force "does not operate and is not
developing capabilities specifically to monitor climate change."119
Although continued work with NASA and the National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) should be a focus area, cooperation between the US
and Norway on environmental surveillance will benefit the intelligence
and research communities and departments of commerce (fish and oil
industry). It will also improve security for both nations and their
allies, especially NATO. Besides enhanced ISR, the Arctic region needs
enhanced PNT accuracy.

Position, Navigation, and Timing

Greater activity in the Arctic demands a heightened military presence in
areal and naval assets. Thus, fully developed and accurate navigation
systems are required to avoid accidents and ensure accurate data for
situational awareness and weapons deployment, if needed. The high angles
from a satellite in a global navigation satellite system---such as the
Global Positioning System or Galileo for the Arctic user---limit the
user's accuracy, especially in the vertical axis.120 The satellite-based
augmentation system (SBAS) is constrained by atmospheric and topography
challenges.121

One solution is to launch SBAS satellites in polar highly elliptical or
low Earth orbits.122 Another is to develop a medium Earth orbit
constellation.123 A dual-use system with future communications
satellites used as SBAS assets represents the third option. Accurate,
secure navigation and timing will be just as significant in the Arctic
region as in the more populated areas between 65° south and 65° north as
the number of cruise ships, commercial carriers, fishing vessels, oil
rigs, and other commercial users increases. Therefore, it is in the
interest of not only the US Space Force, DOD, and Norwegian Armed Forces
to enhance PNT in the area but also that of the US Department of
Commerce, Norwegian Department of Commerce and Fisheries, coast guards,
and justice departments. The development of new technologies to enhance
the accuracy of PNT in the region is, therefore, one area of future
cooperation for the US and Norway. Launch capability is another
important line of effort for both nations.

Launch Capability

Available, credible launch capability is one of Norway's national focus
areas and a focus area in the US space policy. Andøya Space will
establish a launch site for small satellites to polar orbit.124 The
first launch is planned for the first half of 2022.125 The launch
capability will be up to 1.5 metric tons to polar LEO or sun-synchronous
orbit, and the Rocket Factory and Isar Aerospace will supply the initial
launch vehicles.126 Inclination will be from 87.4 to 108 degrees, and
the remote area of Andoeya provides for significant impact and
dispersion areas in the Norwegian Sea.127 The Norwegian government owns
a large part of the company, which will be under governmental control in
case of a conflict. Norway's launch capability will potentially extend
to its allies, both bilateral and NATO, in the Arctic region. Andøya
Spaceport will supplement the US government's existing launch
capabilities. In addition to upstream space operations in launch
capabilities, Norway can also provide downstream capabilities worldwide.

With Norway's geographic placement and relatively mild climate compared
to the latitude, building and operating ground radars for SDA in the
polar region is easier and more friendly to human existence than in
Alaska, Canada, or Greenland. The world's largest ground station is
SvalSat, operated by KSAT.128 Located on Svalbard, an island to the
north of the Norwegian mainland, it is "ideally situated at a high
enough latitude to see every polar-orbiting satellite from all 14 daily
transits."129 Because the Norwegian government owns 50 percent of KSAT
through Space Norway, SvelSat represents a reliable asset in times of
conflict.130 KSAT has 25 ground stations located throughout the world,
including the Norwegian mainland.131 A global network combined with a
cybersecurity focus makes global downloading of payloads and uploading
of software for satellite management possible from the company's offices
in Tromsoe in northern Norway.132 Stronger military cooperation with the
civilian side of the operation, as described in the Norwegian
government's space strategy, will further improve data and cybersecurity
for a military-grade system.

Education, Research, and Development

Norway has a long history as a space nation. Kristian Birkeland, a
Norwegian scientist, completed his famous terrella experiment in 1896 in
which he made artificial Northern Lights, known as the aurora borealis.
This achievement marked the beginning of modern space operations in
Norway.133 The Andøya Rocket Range launched its first scientific rocket
in 1962 and has since launched over a thousand rockets. Norway has
several institutions for space-related education, from satellite
technology to space physics. In cooperation with the University of Oslo
(UiO), the Norwegian military research institute Forsvarets
forskningsinstitutt (FFI) developed the Rimfax radar for the
Perseverence rover.134 Norway is a member of the European Space Agency,
and the Norwegian space industry consists of around 40 companies.135
Several Norwegian companies have further developed technology used
offshore and in areas from medical science to space technology, and
Norwegian technology and knowledge of space and space operations are
world class.136 Space is also a highlighted interest in the Norwegian
national strategy.

Suggested Combined Arctic Space Strategy

A future US and Norwegian combined Arctic space strategy should focus on
three primary efforts. The first is closing the Arctic infrastructure
gap. T[he US and Norway]{.underline} [need]{.underline} [to
recognize]{.underline} [the **increased strategic
significance**]{.underline} of the Arctic region. [Its
**remoteness**]{.underline} [and **harsh conditions**]{.underline}
[underline]{.underline} the need for **[space operations]{.underline}**
[to provide **C3ISR**]{.underline} [to achieve security]{.underline} for
both nations' interests. Gen John Raymond, chief of space operations for
the USSF, states that the Department of the Air Force Arctic Strategy is
"a really important strategy for space" as the US wants to "[**deter
conflict** from **occurring**]{.underline} both [in space]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[through the Arctic]{.underline}**."137 As most US
and Norwegian strategy documents indicate and some space and military
experts argue, there is a need for cooperation between Arctic partners
to "increase vigilance in this increasingly vital region."138 Therefore,
an Arctic space strategy must continue on this track. US and Norwegian
armed forces should expand their cooperation to ensure cost sharing and
shared benefits from education, research, development, and geographic
position to close the gap in necessary infrastructure in the region.

Dual-use assets reduce government spending, and profitable commercial
companies increase a nation's economic power. Commercial companies like
SpaceX conduct technological developments to make space operations
cheaper, better, and more available. The drawback of the commercial
space industry is the lack of governmental control in a conflict.
Therefore, allied governments must deal exclusively with companies from
the involved nations and have transparent contracts and ownership
control. China's One Belt, One Road initiative and Russian corporations'
predatory buy-ups of European companies emphasize this point. Space
capabilities controlled by companies from an adversary nation are not
desirable in case of a conflict.

As a small nation with limited human resources available for a
considerable and credible conventional force, Norway should continue its
strategy of NATO contributions. C3ISR space assets are a sought-after
capacity for NATO, especially in the Arctic area where Russia and China
are increasing their presence. Therefore, Norway needs to continue
developing its focus on technological development within space, cyber,
and artificial intelligence. Technological development will bring new
commercial opportunities and be a backup industry for oil and gas
production, rendering Norway's economy powerless and vulnerable.
Norway's geographic position in the Arctic---with less harsh conditions
than Canada, Alaska, or Greenland---makes it an indispensable choice for
US bilateral collaboration and NATO partner cooperation. Its geographic
position also makes Norway dependent on the Arctic region and therefore
equally as interested as the US in Arctic security. With less access to
livable areas in the Arctic region, the US will benefit from such
cooperation. Continued closing of the infrastructure gap can and should
be done in conjunction with allies and partners.

The second main effort is [**improved SDA** in the **polar
area.**]{.underline} [Space as the **solution**]{.underline} [for the
**US and Norwegian**]{.underline} Arctic [challenges]{.underline} [is
not **exclusive**]{.underline} [to these nations]{.underline}. China and
Russia have shown military and commercial interest in the region and
have increased their space capability in polar orbits. [Increased SDA
is]{.underline} [therefore as **important**]{.underline} [as **increased
ISR** capabilities]{.underline}. [Since]{.underline} [**Chinese** and
**Russian**]{.underline} [intentions]{.underline} in the Arctic [are
**unknown**]{.underline}, [their objectives]{.underline} [in space in
the polar]{.underline} [region are an **area of concern**]{.underline}
for the US, Norway, and NATO allies. [A **robust** and **dependable SDA
system**]{.underline} in the polar region [must therefore]{.underline}
[be **another critical area** of **cooperation**]{.underline}--- [and
one that nations']{.underline} [strategy]{.underline} documents [should
**emphasize**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the most important field of
cooperation does not lie in technical solutions and assets but in the
exchange and increase of knowledge and usage of the capabilities.

#### That [sparks conflicts]{.underline}\-\--Russia's [second strike capabilities]{.underline} and [melting ice]{.underline} make it [increasingly difficult]{.underline} to keep conflict [low level]{.underline}.

[New [opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline} are
[[arising]{.underline}]{.mark} for various [countries [as]{.mark}
**[climate change]{.mark}** **[devastates]{.mark}** the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, [**Russia** has already begun
to stake its claim by **increasing**]{.underline} its [**military
presence** in the region]{.underline}.

The [Arctic is experiencing]{.underline} momentous [transformations as
climate change **wreaks havoc** in the region]{.underline}. It is
[warming at **twice the rate**]{.underline} than the rest of the world.
This is [creating a **positive feedback loop**]{.underline}: as the
temperatures rise in the Arctic, the sea ice that used to reflect
sunlight back into the atmosphere is melting more, which causes the
darker ocean water or land to absorb more light and thus increases the
temperatures in the region. Due to the rising temperatures, the Arctic
is predicted to be completely ice-free during the summer by 2050, even
if significant international action is taken now to reduce carbon
emissions. There is also a major concern that over time, the Arctic will
lose all ability to produce ice, leaving it ice-free year-round.

Russia & Climate Change

However, the effects of climate change in the region are not limited to
the Arctic. Russia has been warming at a rate of 2.5 times faster than
the entire planet since the mid-1970's. Large parts of Russia are- and
will continue to be- greatly impacted by climate change.

On 4 June 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a state of
emergency in northern Siberia after more than 20,000 tons of diesel
leaked into the Ambarnaya River nearby Norilsk city. The oil spill
occurred after the collapse of a fuel tank at the Norilsk Nickel site
due to melting permafrost. This oil spill is one of the largest spills
in Russian history. It is expected to take at least 10 years for the
local ecosystem to recover.

Recently, intense wildfires have been ravaging Siberia, burning through
an area larger than the size of Greece. The wildfires are expected to
exacerbate the effects of climate change in the area.

A special report released by the National Intelligence Council concluded
that although Russia has already begun feeling the effects of climate
change, by 2030, the effects will be magnified. The study outlined the
various ways that climate change will impact Russia's energy, water and
agricultural resources, as well as the consequences for migration and
the intensification of existing socioeconomic and sociopolitical issues.

The responses to the ever-increasing consequences of climate change by
Russian leaders have been mixed. The Russian government released a low
carbon development plan in March that made promises to cut some
emissions, but not enough under the Paris Agreement.

Yet top Russian leaders, including President Putin, have expressed that
these effects brought about by climate change can actually be good for
Russia. Already, the Russian government is planning to "use the
advantages of climate change" to take advantage of polar hydrocarbon
reserves that have been made available due to melting sea ice.

An extensive report published by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies detailed how [[Russia plans to]{.mark}
[utilize]{.mark} the melting of the Arctic [to]{.mark}
**[further]{.mark}** its own **national security
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the report, there [are
three overarching goals of Russia's military presence]{.underline} in
the Arctic: to [boost **defense** along its **northern
border**]{.underline}, especially as interest in the Arctic begins to
rise due to ice melt and potential new passageways; to [protect its
**economic future**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}, to [establish a
**stage** upon which it can **project power**]{.underline}.

Arctic Territory & Russia's Nuclear Posture

The [[main issue]{.mark} [lies with]{.mark} the [fact that]{.mark}
[Russia views]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute]{.underline} (NSR), its maritime passage,
[[as]{.mark} a [domestic]{.mark} [passageway]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
other countries see it as an international passageway. [As Russia
increases its control over the area]{.underline}, [[tensions]{.mark}
will [surely rise]{.mark} as other [countries seek to]{.mark}
[use]{.mark} the [passageway]{.mark} as well]{.underline}.
[China]{.underline} has [already expressed interest]{.underline},
[creating plans for a]{.underline} "**[Polar Silk Road]{.underline}**"
[once the Arctic becomes ice free]{.underline}.

[[Tensions]{.mark} may]{.underline} also [[escalate due to]{.mark} the
**[NSR's proximity]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [Russia's]{.mark}
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Parts]{.mark} of
Russia's nuclear arsenal [and]{.mark} **[second]{.mark}-[strike]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}** are [stationed in]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These are under control of the
Northern Fleet, which provides protection for Russia's nuclear and
non-nuclear military assets in the Arctic.

Russia is already increasing its presence in the region in accordance
with the assertion that the NSR is Russian territory. It has conducted
tests for new Arctic-based hypersonic cruise missiles and
nuclear-powered underwater drones. This has been a cause for concern,
especially for the United States, which worries about the presence of
these new technologies in the region given the cold relationship between
the United States and Russia.

Russia also possesses almost 40 icebreakers with more on the way, making
it the largest fleet of icebreakers in the world. These fleets not only
protect Russia's coastline but also serve as a scientific platform and
monitor commerce throughout the NSR.

Additionally, Russia has given its nuclear agency Rosatom partial
control over the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in the Arctic, and limited
traffic from foreign warships without proper notification protocols.

[[As Russia increases]{.underline}]{.mark} its [**[military]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}lear [presence]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [it will become **[increasingly difficult]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} other [countries to utilize]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}
**[without conflict arising]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is important to
watch this region as climate change persists, to see how Russian actions
in the name of national security will influence broader international
security.

#### Arctic [warming]{.underline} has made the [risk]{.underline} of [conflict]{.underline} [increase]{.underline}.

Although [climate change]{.underline} is a [primary issue in the
Arctic]{.underline} Circle, the [changes it has wrought in the region
have **simultaneously** created new **benefits** and new areas of
**conflict**]{.underline} for the countries surrounding the North Pole.
The [Arctic is warming **twice as fast** as the rest of the

scrambling to take advantage of the new space. The [U.S. and Russia are
taking advantage of the new sea routes]{.underline}, while Canada is
preparing in the event of a new front against Russia across the Arctic
Ocean. Countries are going ahead with plans in the Arctic in fear of new
avenues for conflict and creating threats to international security.

One [direct concern for **NATO nations** is the possibility of
**conflict** with **Russia** over **control** of the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}. Normally, the Arctic Council, a coalition of the
eight countries that border the Arctic Ocean, meets twice a year to
cooperate on issues such as sustainable development and environmental
protection. However, seven of the eight countries announced a "pause" in
council relations due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia chairs the
council until the end of this year, a duty that rotates between
countries. While Russia promised to use its time as chair to focus on
sustainable development, most of its efforts have focused on restoring
and rebuilding Russia's military defenses in the country's northern
territories.

Geopolitics in the Arctic

Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States (US)
border the Arctic Ocean. These countries, together with Finland, Iceland
and Sweden form the so-called Arctic Council, a consultative body that
has governed, together with the United Nations (UN) Convention of the
Law of the Sea, activities in the Arctic. This Council, established in
1996, according to its own admission, cannot implement or enforce its
guidelines, assessments or recommendations. That responsibility belongs
to each individual Arctic State.1 This is also evident from [the pursuit
of raw national interests in this strategic]{.underline}, [and now more
accessible]{.underline}, [region]{.underline}. Over the past decade,
[two developments have]{.underline}, arguably, [shaped the **Arctic
geopolitics** to the **greatest degree**]{.underline}: [the **increasing
assertiveness** of **Russia** and the **growing presence** of
**China**]{.underline}.

Although a non-Arctic state, China has sought to position itself as a
stakeholder in the region. China's research and scientific expeditions
in the Arctic go back to the 1990s. In the past decade its interests
there have expanded, encompassing exploration, commercial, shipping, and
space activities. Beyond its observer role on the Arctic Council, it has
established a narrative beneficial to its interests, including declaring
itself a 'near-Arctic state'.2

In its first Arctic policy of 2018, [Beijing points to the Arctic's
economic and investment potential]{.underline},
[proclaiming]{.underline} its [desire to build a]{.underline} '**[Polar
Silk Road]{.underline}**' [integrated into its larger **B**elt and
**R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline} (BRI) and to ensure its freedom to
operate in the region.3 Part of its initial foothold may be the largest
Chinese investment in the region to date -- the Yamal LNG project with
Russia

China has worked toward building bilateral relationships and provided
substantial capital investment in the Arctic Council countries. Its
approach has been to use soft power projection, such as emphasizing
sustainability, environmental protection and scientific research.
Despite this benign-sounding narrative, Norway5, Sweden, the US, and a
number of other countries believe that China's expansive interest in
this region is strategic and military. Among the concerns are undue
political influence and/or uncontrolled transfers/theft of sensitive
data and technologies.

Chinese Space Activities in the Arctic

[China's **space activities** in the region have been
**expanding**]{.underline}. In December 2018, the relatively new
[**M**inistry of **N**atural **R**esources]{.underline} (MNR), which now
oversees the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA),
[launched the]{.underline} '[Arctic Environment Satellite and Numerical
Weather Forecasting Project']{.underline}. According to MNR, [it is to
assist China's role in the governance of the Arctic and in the building
of the **Polar Silk Road**]{.underline}.6

[Expanding the global footprint of the space ground infrastructure
supports China's]{.underline} influence and **[global power
projection]{.underline}** as space systems are critically dependent upon
its ground segment to provide command and control of the satellites,
[and]{.underline} also [serve as a gateway for **mission
data**]{.underline} such as communications, intelligence, and other
data.

Below is a description of Chinese transactions in the Arctic that
demonstrate this effort, beyond the scope of their publicly declared
vision. China currently has its stations in Kiruna (Sweden)7, Karholl
(Iceland)8, Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard)9, and Longyearbyen (Svalbard)10, and
plans to establish ones in Finland (Sodankyla)11 and Greenland (Nuuk)12.

Sweden

The China Remote Sensing Satellite North Polar Ground Station (CNPGS) in
Kiruna, Sweden (some 200 km north of the Arctic Circle) is run by the
Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI) of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) and began operations in 2017. Located at the
Esrange Space Center, operated by the state-owned Swedish Space
Corporation (SSC), it is the first Chinese overseas Earth observation
satellite data receive station. CAS declared CNPGS in Kiruna13 to be an
important part of China's Gaofen project (launched in 2010) -- a global
EO satellite network to be completed in 2020.14

Concerns have been raised about its potential dual-use purpose. In
January 2019, the Swedish Ministry of Defence's Defence Research Agency
(FOI) publicly expressed a concern that the ostensibly civilian
cooperation with China could, in fact, be controlled by the PLA and used
to supplement military surveillance of the Arctic region with
implications for Sweden's national security.15 SSC also hosts China's
ground facilities in Australia16 and Chile17.

Iceland

The China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory (CIAO) in Karholl, Iceland,
is jointly operated by Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC) and the
Icelandic Centre for Research (Rannis). The project was launched in
2012, based on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between PRIC and
Rannis, land was acquired in 2014 and construction began in 2016. The
land is owned by a non-profit Aurora Observatory (AO), which would
indicate that China changed its approach after the unsuccessful bid in
2011 by Chinese businessman Huang Nubo to acquire land in Iceland and in
Svalbard in 2014. Originally it was envisioned that the station will
serve to observe auroras, but China proposed in 2017 to upgrade the
facility to also enable other types of research.18 The facility, not far
from the Icelandic port town Akureyri, has been operational since
October 2018.19

The country's willingness to engage in lop-sided cooperation
arrangements with China intensified after Iceland's three largest banks
(with assets between them 10 times larger than the country's economy)
collapsed and caused a financial crisis that lasted several years.20
They included the currency swap agreement with China of 3.5 billion RMB,
concluded in 2010, and extended in 2013, between the central banks of
Iceland and China.21 Iceland also became the first European country to
sign a free trade agreement with China in 2013.22

Svalbard/Norway

China's Ny-Ålesund Yellow River Station on Svalbard Island has been
operating since 2004.23 Since 2017, it has been managed by PRIC.
Previously, it was under the oversight of the CAA. Its building is
rented from Norway's Royal Company.24 The declared purpose of the
facility is to use it as an 'integral step for China to improve its
understanding about the impact of climate change in the Arctic to other
continents, Asia in particular'.25 It has the world's largest space
physics observatory and is able to accommodate 37 personnel in summer
and 4 in winter (the highest occupancy of any other country with
facilities there).26 In September 2018, the Polar Research Institute of
Hong Kong (PRIHK) established a station (known as the Bauhinia Station)
in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, located about 150 km away from the Yellow
River Station.27

Finland

Chinese investment in Finland was minimal until the period of Helsinki's
Chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 2017--2019, during which time
China's interest spiked. Ultimately, in January 2019, the success of
China's so-called 'check book' diplomacy was evident during President
Niinisto's visit to Beijing. At that time, a comprehensive agreement was
reached, calling for a China-Finland Joint Action Plan (2019--2023),
which laid the groundwork for additional Chinese investment in the
country going forward.28 Implementation of this action plan has included
an agreement between Chinese RADI and Finnish Meteorological Institute
to establish a joint Research Center for Arctic Space Observations and
Data Sharing to be built in Sodankyla, Lapland.29

Greenland

Although Greenland, to date, resisted Chinese demarches, it remains a
target for Chinese investment. In 2017, rather discretely, a
Chinese-funded satellite ground station and a research facility were
launched in Greenland, a collaboration between a local Greenland
Institute of Natural Resources and Global Change and Earth System
Science Research Institute of the Beijing Normal University (BNU).30

Interestingly, in 2017, Greenland's Prime Minister planned to obtain
funding from Chinese state-run banks for building three commercial
airports in Greenland (costing some \$555 million), but this arrangement
was terminated after concerns were expressed by Denmark and the US
(which has a large military base there at Thule).31 A year earlier, in
2016, the Hong Kong-based company General Nice Ground attempted to
acquire an old naval base in Greenland,32 but it was stopped by the
Danish government over security concerns.33 It is important to note that
Chinese companies hold a stake in uranium and rare-earth mineral (REE)
mines there. In fact, Greenland is said to be emerging as one of key
components of Beijing's Polar Silk Road as the country has a potential
to become another major hub (beyond China) for REE mining.

Key Findings

The examples referenced in the section above demonstrate the incremental
approach that China takes in the developed, democratic countries, often
through seemingly innocent scientific collaboration which is then
expanded beyond the original scope, including into potential military
applications. This is in contrast with the offers of
vertically-integrated space sector packages (partial or complete)
offered by China to developing countries, often including large-scale
subsidized financing.34 Accordingly, China's broader strategic gains in
the Arctic are much harder to detect and quantify (including
legitimizing of its growing involvement in the region).

China's space sector activities are closely aligned with its 'Polar Silk
Road' initiative, a subsidiary of the country's broader BRI, giving the
country access to valuable northern latitude land and infrastructure. It
is difficult to make a clear distinction between civilian and
political-military activities of China in this region, but a connection
has been identified between the establishment of the ground stations in
the Arctic and the Chinese military.

In short, [the Arctic is part of China's **global space power
projection**]{.underline} (and associated economic benefits) the
implications of which are not well understood today. [NATO would be
well-advised to **understand**]{.underline}, [and **carefully
monitor**]{.underline}, [this risk environment]{.underline}, including
its scale and underlying motives.

Goals for an Arctic Strategy

Though the Biden administration has yet to release a National Defense
Strategy and National Military Strategy, guideposts exist to begin
conceptualizing [a new Arctic security strategy]{.underline}. Blinken
expressed the U.S. desire to keep the Arctic peaceful when speaking at
the May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting. The administration's
March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance [focuses on
deterring and preventing adversaries from threatening the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} its
[allies]{.underline}, [inhibiting access to the global
commons]{.underline}, [or dominating key regions]{.underline} (i.e., the
Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere). Even though the
document does not mention the region, its priority actions are
applicable to the Arctic, such as leading a stable and open
international system underwritten by alliances, partnerships,
multilateralism, and international rules.

[[Any]{.mark} new U.S. [Arctic]{.mark} security [strategy]{.mark}
[should]{.mark} have three goals]{.underline}: [**[deter military
attacks]{.mark}** against U.S. or allied territory]{.underline}
originating [from the Arctic]{.underline}, [[prevent]{.mark} [China or
Russia]{.mark} [from]{.mark} **[weakening]{.mark}**
existing]{.underline} rules-based **[Arctic
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}** through coercion, [[and **prevent
regional**]{.mark} **[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} by either China or
Russia. To accomplish these goals, U.S. strategy should develop military
capabilities for use in the North American and European Arctic
subregions and then demonstrate the ability to use them in harsh Arctic
conditions. The U.S. government should persuade regional allies and
partners that the United States can be a trusted security partner in the
region. Finally, the strategy should contain inducements to the private
sector to build dual-use Arctic infrastructure that benefits the private
sector while giving the military platforms from which to observe and
operate in the Arctic.

The Arctic's Geopolitical Context

Any [Arctic strategy is constrained by]{.underline} the region's [harsh
terrain and weather]{.underline} conditions. High latitudes and harsh
weather make communications, global positioning, and domain awareness a
significant challenge across the Arctic. In the Alaskan Arctic,
ground-based infrastructure outside the Anchorage-Fairbanks-Prudhoe
corridor is localized rather than interconnected and is dependent on
bulk summer resupply. U.S. security infrastructure in the Arctic
comprises aging early warning radars in Alaska and Greenland, missile
defenses and significant 5th-generation fighter aircraft in Alaska,
submarines in Arctic waters, and modest rotational forces in Iceland and
Norway. U.S. relations with Arctic nations have been generally
cooperative, with the exception of relations with Russia on non-Arctic
issues since 2014. Finally, different security issues are associated
with the three Arctic subregions --- the North American, European, and
Russian Arctic --- with the European Arctic subregion being the area
with the greatest security challenges.

A new Arctic strategy should factor in climate change, protect the
Arctic Council's viability, and assume a future budget-constrained
environment. It's [safe to assume that [Arctic]{.mark} [warming]{.mark}
will [continue and]{.mark} regional [activity]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
shipping, mining, commercial fishing, tourism, etc. --- [will
**[increase]{.mark}** as a result]{.underline}. [[Transnational
cooperation]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **Arctic [science]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[soft]{.mark}-[security issues]{.mark}**]{.underline} (search and
rescue, oil spill prevention, etc.) [is a **[valued]{.mark}**
behavior]{.underline}. As a result, maintaining the Arctic Council as a
viable international forum serves the continued interests of Arctic
states both because of the substantive work done by the council's
working groups and as a venue for transarctic consultations. A new
strategy should not needlessly threaten this progress.

Finally, the next U.S. Arctic strategy will be means-constrained. The
Arctic will be a relatively low budget priority for the U.S. government
and its military services. None of the recent U.S. military strategies
for the Arctic obligate significant spending in the region for new
capabilities or permanent presence.

Below I list the main goals and new or promised capabilities of recent
U.S. defense strategies for the Arctic. With the exception of the Air
Force's strategy, none of the strategies commit the United States to
major defense investments in the Arctic, and the Air Force expenditures
are not aimed at the Arctic per se, but are instead global capabilities
that happen to be based in the Arctic or in space. Indeed, the gaps
identified below are big-ticket items. The assumption, then, is that any
new Arctic security strategy will be means-constrained going forward but
should compensate for the gaps identified in the table.

Arctic Threats and Opportunities

The [[key threats to U.S]{.mark}. [interests]{.mark} in the region are
[from]{.mark} **[Russia]{.mark}n military [forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the Arctic [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} from **[[Chinese]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark} attempts]{.underline}**. [[Russia]{.mark}n military
activity in the Barents and Greenland Seas]{.underline} (the northern
part of the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap) [[poses]{.mark} the
[most direct threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to U.S. security interests.
[Russian forces there [could attack]{.mark} the **U.S.
[homeland]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**ships** and **data links**]{.mark}
crossing the North Atlantic]{.underline}, [[and threaten **NATO
allies**]{.underline}]{.mark} in northern Europe. Russian forces in the
Bering and Chukchi Seas off the Alaskan coast are equally concerning.
Russian capabilities could also be used to flout international law
through unilateral assertions of control along the Northern Sea Route or
the undersea Lomonosov Ridge, should the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf rule against Russia's recent expansive claims to the
Arctic seabed.

[China's regional actions are troubling]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} its use of [government]{.underline}-linked
[investments]{.underline}, loans, [and trade deals to influence Arctic
states]{.underline} or populations. Threats could also arise from the
military potential in China's bathymetric mapping or its polar research
stations across Scandinavia. Any U.S. security strategy in the Arctic
should alleviate these threats.

In fact, [NATO should be]{.underline} one of [the most **important**
U.S. investment]{.underline}s [in the region]{.underline}. [Four of the
five Arctic coastal states are NATO members]{.underline}, Russia being
the fifth. Iceland, just a squidge off the littoral, is a permanent
member of the Arctic Council, and also a NATO founding member. The
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has **close**]{.underline}
bilateral and multilateral [**relationships** with these
nations]{.underline}, and with the other Arctic Council member states,
Sweden and Finland, as well. These [alliances]{.underline} and
partnerships [are an asset as **tangible** as any platform]{.underline},
[and **far more powerful**]{.underline}. [All of these Arctic
nations]{.underline}, including the United States, [have pragmatic
cooperative relationships with Russia and China]{.underline}, as well,
[but the behavior of both]{.underline} countries in recent years [has
given most Arctic nations pause and a reason for **increased
cooperation** with **each other**]{.underline}. The Trump administration
more or less squandered that opportunity, with its negative messaging
from the top, but the Biden administration gets the benefit of a fresh
start. All of these [NATO and Nordic partners place **great importance**
on dealing with climate change]{.underline} as well, and under Trump,
U.S. unwillingness to engage with them more broadly on clean energy,
climate change adaptation, or climate negotiations was a drag on those
important relationships.

The first is the need for a capability-based, portfolio approach to
Arctic investments. The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates may
[need to ensure access]{.underline}, mobility, support infrastructure,
**[domain awareness]{.underline}**, [and communications
across]{.underline} multiple [domains in the region]{.underline}. To
achieve this, the United States could invest in many other areas besides
icebreakers.

Second, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[might do well to focus more on]{.underline} U.S. [ally]{.underline} and
partner [capabilities in the region]{.underline}. The United States
relies on alliances, often espousing the benefits of partnership, and
indeed the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline}
"**[friends in high places]{.underline}**" [in the Arctic]{.underline},
[including NATO allies **Canada**]{.underline},
**[Denmark]{.underline}**, and **[Norway]{.underline}**, as well as
healthy relationships with Sweden and Finland. Other non-Arctic allies,
such as [**Britain** and the **Netherlands**]{.underline}, also have
Arctic military capabilities. It could be critical to expand joint
training and exercises with these nations, as well as to increase
emulation of some of their exquisite Arctic capabilities. Furthermore,
[being a good partner]{.underline} also [requires
investment]{.underline}. For the United States in the Arctic, [this
could include gaining **interoperability** and ability to **share
more**]{.underline} in areas [where the]{.underline}

[Russia's **invasion**]{.underline} of Ukraine [is **rippling throughout
the world**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} some of [the **strongest
waves**]{.underline} [are crashing in the far north]{.underline}.

There, [Russia's **aggression**]{.underline} [has led to]{.underline}
the **[suspension]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} Arctic
[Council]{.underline}, [the main **international forum** for
cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic, which Russia, awkwardly, was
slated to chair until 2023.

For decades, the Arctic in general --- and the council in particular ---
was something of an oasis from tense and raucous international
relations, working on trade, environmental, and scientific issues while
carefully eschewing security concerns. The council continued to operate
after Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, for instance.

But [the]{.underline} latest **[invasion]{.underline}** [was a **bridge
too far**]{.underline}, [posing]{.underline} "**[grave
impediments]{.underline}** [to international]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}**," according to a joint statement from the
other seven Arctic Council members in March.

That's left what had been a unified group of **[nations
adrift]{.underline}** [in a **critical time**]{.underline} for the
Arctic: **[Climate change]{.underline}** [is **quickly
altering**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} Arctic
[landscape]{.underline}, [creating new]{.underline} economic
**[opportunities]{.underline}**, [more **headaches**]{.underline} for
infrastructure on land, [and **new friction**]{.underline} points
[between countries. The]{.underline} [**confluence** of]{.underline}
Russia's [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} [and climate
change]{.underline} [**stand to alter balance** of trade]{.underline}
and security in the Arctic irrevocably, and a region that once avoided
the troubles of the rest of the world is now being confronted by them.

[Russia's **invasion**]{.underline} of Ukraine [**fractured** the
**delicate peace**]{.underline} in the Arctic

Despite the recent tensions, countries in the far north have long
aspired for "Arctic exceptionalism," the idea that the region would
remain immune from political wrangling and conflicts brewing in other
parts of the world.

"The Soviet Union is in favor of a radical lowering of the level of
military confrontation in the region," said Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in a speech in 1987. "Let the North of the globe, the Arctic,
become a zone of peace. Let the North Pole be a pole of peace."

Since then, Arctic exceptionalism has largely held, with countries in
the region trying to work together and overlook their differences in
other areas. In 1996, Arctic nations founded the Arctic Council. Until
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it was composed of eight states: Canada,
Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and
the United States. The council also includes six permanent groups
representing Indigenous people in the Arctic.

Over the years, the group established agreements on scientific research,
protecting fisheries, conducting search and rescue operations,
developing environmental rules, and defending the rights of Indigenous
people. The council, however, explicitly does not deal with military
issues.

Countries have also pursued their own economic interests in the Arctic
outside of the council. Russia, the country with the longest Arctic
coastline, has vastly expanded its footprint in the Arctic in recent
decades, building roads, airports, power plants, and nuclear-powered ice
breakers, leaning into fossil fuel extraction to boost its economy. Oil
and gas provide 40 percent of Russia's federal budget and account for 60
percent of its exports. Overall, it generates about 20 percent of its
gross domestic product above the Arctic Circle, mainly from oil and gas,
but also from mining minerals and metals.

"Russia is hell-bent on developing Arctic oil and gas resources because
it has no other choice," said Malte Humpert, founder and a senior fellow
at the Arctic Institute think tank. "Purely from a logistical and
technical aspect, what Russia has achieved in the Arctic is really,
really impressive."

Russia is establishing new shipping routes through the Arctic as well.
And to protect all this economic development, Russia's expanded its
military presence in the region, with new bases, hardware, and troops.
It's also conducting long-range bomber flights. "Over the next 30 years,
the Arctic will be critical for Russian economic survival," according to
a 2021 US Army strategic plan.

"The question has always been, where do legitimate security interests
end and where does militarization of the Arctic begin?" Humpert said.

That question makes some other countries uneasy, particularly given that
they have stakes in the Arctic too. China has become a major customer
for Russian fuels from the Arctic and is now the second-largest shipper
in the region. The US Army report said that Russia and China could "seek
to use military and economic power to gain and maintain access to the
region at the expense of US interests."

Russian militarization, and its invasion, have spurred other countries
to step up their military activities in the region. NATO forces are now
conducting exercises in the Arctic, which Russia has warned could lead
to "unintended incidents." The US has deployed F-35 fighter jets to
Alaska and is conducting its own drills in the area.

Russia's war in Ukraine, explained

At the moment, all that's happened are drills. But having so much
military might in a place that was supposed to be "a zone of peace," has
some experts concerned. "We're basically back to the Cold War in terms
of level of activity," said Robert Huebert, an associate professor of
political science at the University of Calgary.

The Arctic Council was never meant to delve into military matters. But
the hope was that the cooperation it fostered in other areas would
minimize the chances of aggression. However, the invasion may end up
excluding Russia from the Arctic Council for good, according to Huebert.

For one thing, Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking to build a
new polar organization with China. "If in fact he's successful in doing
this, I don't see how the Russians can be brought back," Huebert said.

Sweden and Finland are also considering joining NATO, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, as a result of Russia's invasion. That could become
a permanent wedge between Arctic nations. The prospect of NATO expanding
its membership was a big reason why Russia invaded Ukraine to begin
with. "The moment Finland and Sweden join NATO, I just don't ever see
the Russians coming back to the Arctic Council," Huebert said.

Russian officers talk to each other at a base called the "Arctic
Trefoil" on the island of Alexandra Land, Russia, on May 17, 2021. Once
a desolate home mostly to polar bears, Russia's northernmost military
outpost is bristling with missiles and radar and its extended runway can
handle all types of aircraft, including nuclear-capable strategic
bombers.

Climate change is creating new opportunities and flashpoints in the
Arctic

The Arctic itself is rapidly changing. It's warming more than twice as
fast as the global average, reshaping the icy ocean and the lands around
it. Arctic sea ice is declining at its fastest rate in 1,500 years.

But while the Arctic is warming quickly, the effects are not equal
across the region. "One of the things that climate change has really
illustrated is that there's more than one Arctic," Huebert said. Rising
temperatures play out differently depending on whether it's on Alaskan
permafrost, Finnish tundra, or Greenland's ice sheet. Even within the
Arctic, some places are heating up more than others.

Since 1900, the Arctic has warmed on average by 2 degrees Celsius, 3.6
degrees Fahrenheit, fueled by the heat-trapping gasses from burning
fossil fuels. That's playing out several key ways.

Fish stocks are moving further north as species like cod and redfish
seek cold refuge from warming oceans. Many Arctic nations count on
fishing, but right now, there is a moratorium on fishing in the Arctic
for at least 15 years. After that, the waters could become a lot more
crowded than they are now: "I think the boats will follow eventually if
that moratorium is lifted," said Mia Bennett, an assistant professor of
geography at the University of Washington.

Shipping has already become easier. Arctic sea ice is not just
retreating to record lows, but the ice that remains is also often
thinner, allowing icebreakers to more readily guide vessels through
frigid waters. In 2016, the Crystal Serenity became the first cruise
ship to transit the Northwest Passage. Warming is also facilitating
offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. The US Geological Survey
estimated the Arctic holds 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil
and 30 percent of undiscovered natural gas.

But warming is also making life more difficult in other ways. "It's
actually getting much trickier on land to build stable terrestrial
infrastructure," Bennett said. Higher temperatures means the permafrost
isn't so permanent. The softer ground is causing roads to buckle and
buildings to list. The Pentagon recently warned that US military
installations in the Arctic are being damaged by the effects of warming.
Onshore drillers have even had to chill the ground under their rigs in
order to stabilize them and continue drilling.

Shorter and warmer winters mean the ground doesn't harden back up as
much and rivers don't freeze over, making it more difficult to maintain
ice roads to bring in supplies. Wildfires have also ignited in the
Arctic Circle as climate change has fueled heat waves and extended fire
seasons.

Russia has faced some of the worst of it. Massive wildfires in Siberia
blanketed the country in smoke in recent years. The fires this year are
already spreading at an unprecedented rate. On June 20, 2020, the
Russian town of Verkhoyansk recorded a temperature of 100.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, the hottest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic
Circle.

"All this is largely connected to the climate change --- both global and
in our country," Putin said in August.

While climate change is an omnipresent factor in the Arctic, Huebert
cautioned that it's not necessarily the "cause" of many of the recent
developments in the region. Russia has faced strong economic pressure to
exploit more of its natural resources and would likely be expanding its
footprint even if the Arctic hadn't warmed. And despite the changes in
the climate seen so far, the Arctic remains a difficult place to work
and live. "It's being definitely facilitated by climate change, it's
making it easier, but it's not making it easy," Huebert said.

Still, [climate change is **acting as an accelerant**]{.underline} for
activity in the region. Those activities, particularly [fossil fuel
**extraction**]{.underline}, in turn are **[speeding up]{.underline}**
the [transformation]{.underline} of the Arctic. And all [this new
**bustle** in a once]{.underline} **[frigid]{.underline}** and
**[desolate part]{.underline}** of the [world]{.underline}, coupled with
climate change, [could then **spark more conflict**]{.underline}.

The future of the Arctic is on thin ice

**[Intelligence agencies]{.underline}** [are now trying to
**anticipate**]{.underline} future [**disruptions** in the
Arctic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} have [identified some]{.underline}
potential **[ignition points]{.underline}**.

"[We assess that]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline} and non-Arctic
[states]{.underline} almost certainly [will **increase their
competitive**]{.underline} [activities]{.underline} [as the
region]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} [more]{.underline}
**[accessible]{.underline}** [because of]{.underline} [warming
**temperatures**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} reduced
[ice]{.underline}," reads an October 2021 report from the National
Intelligence Council. "[**Competition** will be]{.underline} largely
**[economic]{.underline}** [but the risk]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**ulation [will **increase**]{.underline}
modestly by 2040 [as]{.underline} commercial and **[military activity
grows]{.underline}** and opportunities are [more
contested]{.underline}."

[One]{.underline} looming [concern]{.underline} is how countries will
**[claim territory]{.underline}** [in the newly]{.underline} [revealed
**Arctic ocean**]{.underline}. [Countries]{.underline} currently
[**control** the water stretching]{.underline} [200]{.underline}

WASHINGTON: [The **biggest focus** of]{.underline} collaboration
[between US]{.underline} Northern [Command]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} US **[Space Command]{.underline}** [will be on
**secure communication**]{.underline} [capabilities in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, according to the leader of NORTHCOM/NORAD.

Responding to a question as the annual Space and Missile Defense
conference in Huntsville, Ala., earlier this month about how his team
and SPACECOM are integrating, Gen. Glen VanHerck noted that secure comms
will be particularly vital for the Arctic area --- itself becoming a
more prominent part of the NORTHCOM/NORAD mission to defense the
homeland.

"[Limited **com**]{.underline}munication**[s]{.underline}** north of 65
latitude, [and the ability to **command**]{.underline} [and
**control**]{.underline} in our homeland --- [when **you're under
attack**]{.underline} in the electromagnetic spectrum secure, reliable
**[com]{.underline}**munication**[s]{.underline}** [will be]{.underline}
[something]{.underline} that [we have to **maintain**]{.underline},"
VanHerck said, noting he's "working with SPACECOM on that."

The general noted that **[proliferated]{.underline}**
**[L]{.underline}**ow **[E]{.underline}**arth **[O]{.underline}**rbit
(below 2,000 kilometers in altitude) **[constellations]{.underline}**
[will be "**crucial**]{.underline}" for the future mission --- something
he previewed earlier in the year, when he discussed a series of tests
being run through Air Force Research Laboratory.

The Air Force has also been running a series of wargames to flesh out
its year-old Arctic Strategy, with the far north seen as critical in any
future conflict with Russia or China. The Navy too has been doubling
down on DoD concerns that the warming environment is upping the ante in
competition for Arctic resources, including oil.

In February, during a press conference with Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau, President Joe Biden noted the importance of the Arctic
to the two NATO allies.

The two leaders "agreed to modernize the North American Aerospace
Defense Command --- NORAD --- which is still the only bi-national
military command of its kind," Biden told reporters. "And we will launch
an expanded U.S-Canadian Arctic dialogue to cover issues related to
continental security, economic and social development, and Arctic
governance."

Further, [Congress]{.underline} has [raised **red flags**]{.underline}
[about **increased**]{.underline} Russian [military]{.underline}
[activity]{.underline} in the Arctic region, [as well as **China's
attempts**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[position
itself]{.underline}** [as an Arctic]{.underline} [nation]{.underline}
despite the facts of geography.

The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act authorized \$46 million for
the Space Force to begin developing an initial satellite capability for
the region, focused on "low- and medium-earth orbit communications that
could support additional satellite capability to begin to establish more
robust communications at these northern latitudes." Congressional
appropriators bumped that sum up to \$50 million in the 2021 defense
appropriations bill.

Something else that is crucial for NORTHCOM in space? Getting rid of
stovepiped information.

"[The **biggest challenge**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} \[using\]
**[space layer data]{.underline}** [right now is
**over-classification**]{.underline} [and sharing of]{.underline}
[information]{.underline}," VanHerck said. "[The fact]{.underline} of
the matter [is]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} [**can't live** **with
that data**]{.underline} and information [in
**stovepipes**]{.underline}, [it **must be shared**]{.underline} to take
action on, [in real time]{.underline} or near real time, [for **decision
making**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} actual execution of
[deterrence]{.underline} or defense options."

On that regard, VanHerck fits into a broader push seen among top US
officers dealing with space issues in calling for greater
declassification, including Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has made a public call for cutting
classification overall.

"[In **space**]{.underline}, [we **over-classify**]{.underline}
everything," Hyten told the National Security Space Association on Jan.
22. "**[Deterrence does not happen in the classified]{.underline}**
world. Deterrence does not happen in the black; deterrence happens in
the white."

[Moscow and Washington]{.underline} [turned]{.underline} [to
**diplomacy**]{.underline} this week [amid **intensifying**]{.underline}
Russian **[military activity]{.underline}** in the vicinity of its near
abroad. The buildup of troops along the Ukrainian border and sending of
"peacekeeping" forces to support the Tokayev regime\'s violent crackdown
on protests in Kazakhstan are not comparable except in their timing.
However, they serve as a double reminder of Russia\'s political stature
and military might.

[The **Barents Sea**]{.underline} region of the Arctic, where Russia
meets Norway, [is becoming]{.underline} **[another seam of
tension]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} [NATO and]{.underline}
[Russia]{.underline}. [The region features the]{.underline}
**[headquarters]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} [Russian
Navy\'s]{.underline} Northern [Fleet]{.underline} in Severomorsk, [as
well as **valuable**]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology
[and]{.underline} **[mining hubs]{.underline}** and Indigenous and other
communities. [Russia]{.underline} [has been intensifying]{.underline}
the [frequency]{.underline} [and **scale of exercises**]{.underline} in
the area. [NATO]{.underline} [has]{.underline} also [conducted
**exercises**]{.underline} [close by]{.underline} in recent years,
**[prompting]{.underline}** Russian [responses]{.underline}. Moscow also
disputes the maritime limits of Oslo\'s jurisdiction in the Arctic
archipelago of Svalbard, based on its interpretation of a 1920 treaty.

Despite continued diplomacy to resolve NATO-Russia points of contention
within and beyond the Arctic (including the alliance\'s relationships
with Ukraine and Georgia), Russia\'s recent military activity in the
Arctic raises questions for the United States as to what types of Arctic
military capabilities it needs as part of an overarching strategy to
ensure credibility at the negotiating table and an ability to deal with
crises.

Russia\'s recent military activity in the Arctic raises questions for
the United States as to what types of Arctic military capabilities it
needs.

[Part of the challenge]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the **[Arctic\'s
uniqueness]{.underline}**. In a crisis, [**redeployment** of
forces]{.underline} from other regions to the Arctic [would be
**hampered**]{.underline} [by the region\'s]{.underline} extreme
[climate]{.underline}, [its **remoteness**]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[vast distances]{.underline}** within it, [its
**sparse infrastructure**]{.underline}, [its]{.underline} limited
[transportation]{.underline} [and medical services]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} **[scarce satellite coverage]{.underline}**. Equipment
needs to be tailored for the harsh Arctic environment; similarly,
personnel need prior training within it to be able to operate
effectively despite nights that last for months, ionospheric effects
that impede communications, the need to wear bulky clothing that hampers
movement, and manual dexterity and a host of other challenges.

The last decade has seen numerous U.S. national and service-specific
Arctic strategy documents aimed at spurring plans for new capabilities
and capacity. The most important recent investment decision has been to
recapitalize the U.S. Coast Guard\'s icebreaker fleet. However, two
important factors critical to effective U.S. preparations for countering
Russia in the Arctic (and perhaps China, which in recent years has
become increasingly involved in the region) are often overlooked.

The first is the need for a capability-based, portfolio approach to

[In]{.underline} early **[March]{.underline}**, an estimated [7,500
American]{.underline} combat [troops will travel to Norway]{.underline}
to join thousands of soldiers from other NATO countries [in a massive
mock battle]{.underline} with imagined invading forces from Russia. In
this futuristic simulated engagement \-- it goes [by the name of
Exercise **Cold Response 2020**]{.underline} \-- allied forces will
"conduct multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat
scenario in demanding winter conditions," or so claims the Norwegian
military anyway. At first glance, this may look like any other NATO
training exercise, but think again. There's nothing ordinary about Cold
Response 2020. As a start, it's being staged above the Arctic Circle,
far from any previous traditional NATO battlefield, and [it raises to a
new level the possibility of a **great-power conflict** that might end
in a **nuclear exchange** and **mutual annihilation**.
Welcome]{.underline}, in other words, [to **World War III**'s newest
battlefield]{.underline}.

For the soldiers participating in the exercise, the potentially
thermonuclear dimensions of Cold Response 2020 may not be obvious. At
its start, Marines from the United States and the United Kingdom will
practice massive amphibious landings along Norway's coastline, much as
they do in similar exercises elsewhere in the world. Once ashore,
however, the scenario becomes ever more distinctive. After collecting
tanks and other heavy weaponry "prepositioned" in caves in Norway's
interior, the Marines will proceed toward the country's far-northern
Finnmark region to help Norwegian forces stave off Russian forces
supposedly pouring across the border. From then on, the two sides will
engage in \-- to use current Pentagon terminology \-- high-intensity
combat operations under Arctic conditions (a type of warfare not seen on
such a scale since World War II).

And that's just the beginning. Unbeknownst to most Americans, the
Finnmark region of Norway and adjacent Russian territory have become one
of the most likely battlegrounds for the first use of nuclear weapons in
any future NATO-Russian conflict. [Because Moscow has concentrated a
significant part of its nuclear retaliatory capability on the Kola
Peninsula, a remote stretch]{.underline} of land [abutting]{.underline}
northern [Norway \-- any U.S.-NATO success in actual combat]{.underline}
with Russian forces near [that territory would endanger a significant
part of Russia's nuclear arsenal and so might precipitate the **early
use of such munitions**]{.underline}. Even a simulated victory \-- the
predictable result of Cold Response 2020 \-- will undoubtedly set
Russia's nuclear controllers on edge.

To appreciate just how risky any NATO-Russian clash in Norway's far
north would be, consider the region's geography and the strategic
factors that have led Russia to concentrate so much military power
there. And all of this, by the way, will be playing out in the context
of another existential danger: climate change. The melting of the Arctic
ice cap and the accelerated exploitation of Arctic resources are lending
this area ever greater strategic significance.

Energy Extraction in the Far North

Look at any map of Europe and you'll note that Scandinavia widens as it
heads southward into the most heavily populated parts of Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden. As you head north, however, it narrows and
becomes ever less populated. At its extreme northern reaches, only a
thin band of Norway juts east to touch Russia's Kola Peninsula. To the
north, the Barents Sea, an offshoot of the Arctic Ocean, bounds them
both. This remote region \-- approximately 800 miles from Oslo and 900
miles from Moscow \-- has, in recent years, become a vortex of economic
and military activity.

Once prized as a source of vital minerals, especially nickel, iron ore,
and phosphates, this remote area is now the center of extensive oil and
natural gas extraction. With temperatures rising in the Arctic twice as
fast as anywhere else on the planet and sea ice retreating ever farther
north every year, offshore fossil-fuel exploration has become
increasingly viable. As a result, large reserves of oil and natural gas
\-- the very fuels whose combustion is responsible for those rising
temperatures \-- have been discovered beneath the Barents Sea and both
countries are seeking to exploit those deposits. Norway has taken the
lead, establishing at Hammerfest in Finnmark the world's first plant
above the Arctic Circle to export liquified natural gas. In a similar
fashion, Russia has initiated efforts to exploit the mammoth Shtokman
gas field in its sector of the Barents Sea, though it has yet to bring
such plans to fruition.

For Russia, even more significant oil and gas prospects lie further east
in the Kara and Pechora Seas and on the Yamal Peninsula, a slender
extension of Siberia. Its energy companies have, in fact, already begun
producing oil at the Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea and the
Novoportovskoye field on that peninsula (and natural gas there as well).
Such fields hold great promise for Russia, which exhibits all the
characteristics of a petro-state, but there's one huge problem: the only
practical way to get that output to market is via specially-designed
icebreaker-tankers sent through the Barents Sea past northern Norway.

The exploitation of Arctic oil and gas resources and their transport to
markets in Europe and Asia has become a major economic priority for
Moscow as its hydrocarbon reserves below the Arctic Circle begin to dry
up. Despite calls at home for greater economic diversity, President
Vladimir Putin's regime continues to insist on the centrality of
hydrocarbon production to the country's economic future. In that
context, production in the Arctic has become an essential national
objective, which, in turn, requires assured access to the Atlantic Ocean
via the Barents Sea and Norway's offshore waters. Think of that waterway
as vital to Russia's energy economy in the way the Strait of Hormuz,
connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is to the Saudis and
other regional fossil-fuel producers.

The Military Dimension

No less than Russia\'s giant energy firms, its navy must be able to
enter the Atlantic via the Barents Sea and northern Norway. Aside from
its Baltic and Black Sea ports, accessible to the Atlantic only via
passageways easily obstructed by NATO, the sole Russian harbor with
unfettered access to the Atlantic Ocean is at Murmansk on the Kola
Peninsula. Not surprisingly then, that port is also the headquarters for
Russia's Northern Fleet \-- its most powerful \-- and the site of
numerous air, infantry, missile, and radar bases along with naval
shipyards and nuclear reactors. In other words, it's among the most
sensitive military regions in Russia today.

Given all this, President Putin has substantially rebuilt that very
fleet, which fell into disrepair after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
equipping it with some of the country's most advanced warships. In 2018,
according to The Military Balance, a publication of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, it already possessed the largest number
of modern cruisers and destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with
22 attack submarines and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk
area are dozens of advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of
anti-aircraft defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military
officials indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the
Arctic the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of
hypersonic velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again
presumably to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's
Finnmark, the site of the upcoming NATO exercise.

More significant yet is the way Moscow has been strengthening its
nuclear forces in the region. Like the United States, Russia maintains a
"triad" of nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range "heavy" bombers, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Under the terms of the
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), signed by the two
countries in 2010, the Russians can deploy no more than 700 delivery
systems capable of carrying no more than 1,550 warheads. (That pact
will, however, expire in February 2021 unless the two sides agree to an
extension, which appears increasingly unlikely in the age of Trump.)
According to the Arms Control Association, the Russians are currently
believed to be deploying the warheads they are allowed under New START
on 66 heavy bombers, 286 ICBMs, and 12 submarines with 160 SLBMs. Eight
of those nuclear-armed subs are, in fact, assigned to the Northern
Fleet, which means about 110 missiles with as many as 500 warheads \--
the exact numbers remain shrouded in secrecy \-- are deployed in the
Murmansk area.

For Russian nuclear strategists, such nuclear-armed submarines are
considered the most "survivable" of the country's retaliatory systems.
In the event of a nuclear exchange with the United States, the country's
heavy bombers and ICBMs could prove relatively vulnerable to pre-emptive
strikes as their locations are known and can be targeted by American
bombs and missiles with near-pinpoint accuracy. Those subs, however, can
leave Murmansk and disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean at the onset
of any crisis and so presumably remain hidden from U.S. spying eyes. To
do so, however, requires that they pass through the Barents Sea,
avoiding the NATO forces lurking nearby. For Moscow, in other words, the
very possibility of deterring a U.S. nuclear strike hinges on its
ability to defend its naval stronghold in Murmansk, while maneuvering
its submarines past Norway's Finnmark region. No wonder, then, that this
area has assumed enormous strategic importance for Russian military
planners \-- and the upcoming Cold Response 2020 is sure to prove
challenging to them.

Washington's Arctic Buildup

During the Cold War era, Washington viewed the Arctic as a significant
strategic arena and constructed a string of military bases across the
region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet bombers and missiles
crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in North America. After
the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington abandoned many of those
bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once again identifying "great
power competition" with Russia and China as the defining characteristic
of the present strategic environment, many of those bases are being
reoccupied and new ones established. Once again, the Arctic is being
viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia and, as a result,
U.S. forces are being readied for possible combat there.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "Pompeo Doctrine," he indicated that the United
States was shifting from benign neglect of the region to aggressive
involvement and militarization. "We're entering a new age of strategic
engagement in the Arctic," he insisted, "complete with new threats to
the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in that
region." To better protect those interests against Russia's military
buildup there, "we are fortifying America's security and diplomatic
presence in the area\... hosting military exercises, strengthening our
force presence, rebuilding our icebreaker fleet, expanding Coast Guard
funding, and creating a new senior military post for Arctic Affairs
inside of our own military."

The Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close
reading of the military press suggests that this activity has been
particularly focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin
with, the Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that
country, the first time foreign forces have been stationed there since
German troops occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330
Marines were initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017,
presumably to help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of U.S.
tanks and combat vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was
then dispatched to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far
closer to the Russian border.

From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is the construction
of a U.S. radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø about 40 miles
from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction with the
Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will evidently
be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines, assumedly in
order to target them and take them out in the earliest stages of any
conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is evident from the
mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018, sending 11 Su-24
supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island. (They turned
aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a surface-to-surface
missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.

In addition, in August 2018, the U.S. Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond \-- from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational.

Deciphering Cold Response 2020

Exercise Cold Response 2020 must be viewed in the context of all these
developments. Few details about the thinking behind the upcoming war
games have been made public, but it's not hard to imagine what at least
part of the scenario might be like: a U.S.-Russian clash of some sort
leading to Russian attacks aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø
and Norway's defense headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern
coast. The invading troops will be slowed but not stopped by Norwegian
forces (and those U.S. Marines stationed in the area), while thousands
of reinforcements from NATO bases elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.
Eventually, of course, the tide will turn and the Russians will be
forced back.

No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for Pentagon
planners the situation will go far beyond this. Any Russian assault on
critical Norwegian military facilities would presumably be preceded by
intense air and missile bombardment and the forward deployment of major
naval vessels. This, in turn, would prompt comparable moves by the U.S.
and NATO, probably resulting in violent encounters and the loss of major
assets on all sides. In the process, [Russia's key nuclear retaliatory
forces would be]{.underline} at risk and [quickly placed on **high
alert** with senior officers operating in **hair-trigger mode**. Any
misstep might then lead to]{.underline} what humanity has feared since
August 1945: a **[nuclear apocalypse]{.underline}** on Planet Earth.

There is no way to know to what degree such considerations are
incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the U.S. Strategic Air Command, indicating that the American
military is keenly aware of the escalatory risks of any large-scale
U.S.-Russian encounter in the Arctic.

In short, what might otherwise seem like a routine training exercise in
a distant part of the world is actually part [of an emerging U.S.
strategy to overpower Russia in a critical]{.underline} defensive
[zone]{.underline}, an approach that [could **easily** result in
**nuclear war**]{.underline}. The Russians are, of course, well aware of
this and so will undoubtedly be watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine
trepidation. Their fears are understandable \-- but we should all be
concerned about a strategy that seemingly embodies such a high risk of
future escalation.

Ever since the Soviets acquired nuclear weapons of their own in 1949,
strategists have wondered how and where an all-out
**[nuclear]{.underline}** war \-- [**World War III** \-- would break
out]{.underline}. At one time, that incendiary scenario was believed
most likely to involve a clash over the divided city of Berlin or along
the East-West border in Germany. After the Cold War, however, fears of
such a deadly encounter evaporated and few gave much thought to such
possibilities. Looking forward today, however, the prospect of a
catastrophic World War III is again becoming all too imaginable and this
time, it appears, [an incident in the **Arctic** could prove the **spark
for Armageddon**]{.underline}.

ISS = International Space Station

When you're screaming through the void faster than a speeding bullet,
any traffic you encounter might as well be made of, well, speeding
bullets. Defensive driving is recommended.

[Hazardous space [debris]{.mark}]{.underline} has twice [threatened
the]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**nternational **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[S]{.underline}**tation recently. On or around November 12, a debris
field generated by a Russian military anti-satellite missile, or ASAT
test, sent ISS crew members --- including Russian cosmonauts --- to
shelter in the station's Dragon and Soyuz spacecraft in case they needed
to evacuate, while on December 2, the station maneuvered around a chunk
of a defunct American Pegasus rocket.

No one was hurt in either case, and the risks were hardly novel --- the
ISS has maneuvered around space debris more than 30 times since 1999.
But [it's]{.underline} also [a [problem]{.mark} that's]{.underline}
almost [[**guaranteed** to **worsen**]{.mark} given worrying
trends]{.underline} in the militarization of space [and the fact that
all signs point to **ever more** objects being launched]{.underline}
into space every year.

Take into consideration mega-constellations like SpaceX's Starlink, for
which "the plan is to launch 100,000 active satellites in the next few
years," Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astrophysicist who has been
tracking satellites on the side for more than a decade, tells Inverse.
"The collision rate grows as the square of the number of satellites. If
you have 10 times as many satellites, you will have 100 times as many
collisions."

And the thing is, space debris is not simply the detritus of old space
missions. A satellite stricken by orbital debris becomes debris itself,
which can then hit another satellite, creating debris that can strike
another, and so on. It's a chain reaction known as **[[Kessler
Syndrome]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and while it doesn't take place in the
half-hour time frame as dramatized in the movie Gravity, the [[result
may]{.mark} be the same]{.underline}: **[[no more]{.mark} outer [space
for anybody]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"At least some models suggest that, yeah, it\'s already underway,"
McDowell says, "it\'s just going to take a century to play out."

SPACE JUNK BASICS

It's a good thing the sky is so big, because humans have flung a lot of
things up there. And every bit of it, from large spacecraft to tiny
pieces of cloth, are careening around at 17,500 miles-per-hour or
faster. At those speeds, even collisions between somewhat small objects
can be catastrophic.

"The unit I like to use is a megajoule, which is the kinetic energy of a
one-ton truck hitting you at 100 miles an hour," McDowell says.
Collisions between small satellites can generate tens of thousands of
megajoules of kinetic energy, while even tiny pieces of debris still
pack enough of a punch to drill bullet holes in the ISS and other space
assets. The Hubble Space Telescope carries a Whipple shield, for
instance, a sort of bulletproof vest to absorb the energy of more minor
debris impacts.

It's an imperfect solution, "smaller" being relative and "big" being
game over.

"If you get hit by a big enough piece of debris, \[a Whipple shield\] is
not gonna be enough," McDowell says. "And if something comes down the
telescope aperture and hits the Hubble mirror, that's also not good."

The good news is that organizations that track debris, such as the US
Space Command, have a pretty good handle on the big stuff in orbit ---
anything from multi-ton dead satellites to debris 10 centimeters across.

"The trackable debris we follow as individual objects, and we're
tracking about 40,000 objects, of which 5,000 or so are working
satellites and the rest is junk," McDowell says. "If you look at stuff
down to just one centimeter, there's probably a million of those. But we
don't really know because they're too small."

There are two main sources of space debris at the moment, the primary
being old rocket stages still in orbit decades after the delivery of
their payload. "The fuel and the oxidizer get together because the seals
fail," McDowell says, "And they go bang."

The secondary source is military anti-satellite tests, he says, which
generate debris clouds that can persist for decades.

But [if a Kessler Syndrome cascade]{.underline} is already
[underway]{.underline}, and continues apace unmitigated, [eventually the
most significant source of space debris will be the **pulverized
remains** of]{.underline} satellites, [spacecraft]{.underline}, and
space stations [dashed upon **rocks** of our **own
making**]{.underline}.

A HISTORY OF SPACE JUNKING AND SPACE PUNKING

Putting aside the occasional meteor shower, space debris is an entirely
human creation --- satellites don't launch themselves.

But not all space debris is created equally. Many objects are merely
byproducts of early space exploration, while the birth of others was
more intentional.

For example, while Russia has drawn international criticism for its ASAT
test in November, in the early 1960s, it was the Soviet Union who
accused the United States of purposefully polluting the spaceways.

Between 1961 and 1963, the United States launched almost half a billion
copper needles into low-Earth orbit, Caltech historian of technology
Lisa Ruth Rand tells Inverse. Called Project West Ford, it was an
attempt to create an artificial ionosphere for long-range radio
communications in case a US-USSR nuclear war disrupted other means.

The Soviets were not amused, and accused the US of "trying to destroy
all space so that no one else could use it, out of spite," Rand says.

Both the Soviet Union and the United States developed and tested
anti-satellite missile technologies in the 1970s and 80s, creating
orbital debris and leading to a lull in ASAT tests until 2007, when
China used an ASAT to destroy an old weather satellite.

The US used an ASAT missile to destroy a spy satellite that failed after
its launch in 2008, and India launched a small satellite in January of
2019 only to shoot it down with an ASAT in March 2019.

The next and most recent ASAT test to actually destroy a satellite in
space was the Russian test in November, and all four of the tests
created debris, some of which will remain in orbit for years to come.

"Most of the debris from the Russian ASAT will be down on a timescale of
like five years, and the rest of it will be down on the timescale of 10
to 20 years, which, it's still not good," McDowell says. "For the
Chinese ASAT, which was up at a higher altitude, more like 900
kilometers, some of that debris is likely going to be up there for many
decades."

Such intentional creation of space debris seems irrational and
irresponsible given how problematic incidental space debris already is.
A 2009 collision between an Iridium communications satellite and a
defunct Russian satellite over Siberia first turned Rand on to studying
space debris as a research focus while in grad school, and for every
impact, there are many more close calls.

In 2012, for instance, a defunct Soviet Kosmos satellite threatened the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and presented its operators with a tough
decision, Rand says. "Either light up thrusters that had been dormant
for years, that were cold and could blow the whole works," or hope the
debris would pass further from Fermi than projected, such predictions
always coming as probabilities rather than certainties.

She says that the operators ultimately opted to risk using the
thrusters, and the space telescope moved, and all was fine, but it was
still a risky situation.

And such situations are not always improved when all satellites involved
are still live and operational. In September 2019, Rand says, a Starlink
satellite and an ESA satellite almost collided when operators at SpaceX
failed to check their email and missed some urgent missives from their
counterparts at ESA.

And over the summer of 2021, McDowell recently tweeted, the Chinese
space station twice dodged Starlink satellites that may have passed
within 1 kilometer of the station.

"These are the kinds of close calls are happening a lot and increasingly
more as the number of objects in outer space increases," Rand says. "The
number of functioning satellites in space is just exploding. It's huge.
It's getting bigger and bigger every day."

WHAT IS KESSLER SYNDROME AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?

In some ways, [the **Kessler Syndrome** is like a ***slow-moving zombie
apocalypse***]{.underline}. (In George Romero's classic Night of the
Living Dead, Rand notes, it's theorized a contaminated satellite
returning from Venus triggers the zombie rise.) [The space debris chain
reaction converts otherwise operational space assets into **further
navigational hazards**]{.underline}. "It's an unwanted weaponizing of a
valuable object into something that becomes dangerous," Rand says. Had
the Fermi telescope thrusters failed, "th[at would have been the loss of
a **major scientific instrument**]{.underline} and cultural heritage
artifact that had become a series of projectiles."

And the threat of losing space assets means the [Kessler
Syndrome]{.underline} has a costly impact long before the [chain
reaction has progressed enough to **prevent access** to
space]{.underline}.

More satellites in space mean more potential collisions, which means
more satellites --- and space stations --- making more frequent evasive
maneuvers to avoid further collisions, all of which can interrupt
operations and cost operators money by decreasing the lifespan of their
satellites. Every Starlink satellite has a limited amount of krypton
propellant onboard for maneuvering around debris and Chinese space
stations, for instance, and when the tank is near empty, it's time for
that satellite's long fiery goodbye bow in the upper atmosphere ---
failure to do so just increases the problem by adding another dead
satellite.

"[Space is big]{.underline}," Rand says, "[but once things start to
collide]{.underline}, [it becomes **rapidly small**]{.underline}."

Rapidly, but not linearly. Unfortunately, if the Kessler cascade is
already underway, it will take years to reach a point where it's
happening in what humans perceive as "real-time." By then, it may be too
late.

"On a timescale of decades, you'll have to dodge more and more often,
and [eventually you won't be able to dodge anymore because the traffic
is so bad]{.underline}," McDowell says. Adding the caveat that it's just
his back-of-the-envelope math, he says, "we are probably exceeding the
carrying capacity of low Earth orbit right now."

The [consequence of full bore Kessler syndrome allowed to run its course
would be to negate]{.underline} the [**sci-fi ambitions**]{.underline}
of people like Elon Musk. [To **proscribe** humans from the **cosmos**
and **limit** our future to that of a **one-planet species** for many
lifetimes]{.underline} --- physically and intellectually. The space
debris could ruin ground-based astronomy, too, hemming in our minds as
well as our rockets.

"[It would]{.underline} mean to basically [close ourselves off from the
rest of the cosmos]{.underline}," Rand says. "That the endgame of the
space age is not so much humanity becoming cosmopolitan, becoming
multi-planetary, becoming part of the universe, but instead making it so
that we just can't leave anymore."

targeted strategies for specific existential risks. If we want to reduce
the existential risk posed by nuclear weapons, then we can and should
develop specific strategies for that risk.

Another approach is [to develop and pursue]{.underline} what can be
called [**[meta-strategies]{.mark}** that [target]{.mark}
**[all]{.mark}** existential [risks **at once**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
One of [**[most effective]{.mark}** meta-strategies for tackling
existential risks]{.underline} in general [[is **space
colonization**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[If we]{.mark} manage to
[establish]{.mark} permanent and self-sustainable human
[habitats]{.mark} **[beyond Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then [our
**proverbial existential [eggs]{.mark}** are **[not all in one
basket]{.mark}** anymore]{.underline}. For example, [[if
**disaster**]{.mark} **[strikes]{.mark}** on Earth]{.underline}, [but
there are **billions** of humans living on **Venus** and
**Mars**]{.underline}, [[humankind would **continue**]{.mark} **to
exist** even with Earth-humans gone]{.underline}.

[Because of existential risks]{.underline}, a [**[long-term
future]{.mark}** [in which]{.mark} [humankind]{.mark} still
[exists]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [[**certainly** has to be]{.mark} a
[future in which]{.mark} [humankind]{.mark} has [**succeeded**
in]{.mark} **[colonizing space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today, even
though we regularly venture into space, we do not yet have space
colonization capabilities. There are a number of technological
challenges that we need to overcome in order to become capable of space
colonization. One of those challenges is energy. There are several
reasons why.

### SSA ADV\-\--Kessler\-\--Space

#### The Kessler Syndrome makes space [impossible]{.underline} to navigate.

Exploring space is one of humanity's most hopeful activities. By going
out into the great unknown of the Universe, we hope to extend our reach,
find new resources and life forms, while solving many of our earthly
problems. But [going to space is **not** something to take for
**granted**]{.underline}---[it can]{.underline} actually [become
**impossible**]{.underline}. There is a scenario, called the **[Kessler
Syndrome]{.underline}**, [that can cause the **end** of **all space
exploration**]{.underline} and dramatically impact our daily lives.

In 1978, the NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler proposed that [a chain
reaction of **exploding space debris** can end up making space
activities and the use of satellites **impossible**]{.underline} for
generations. He predicted that the number of objects that we keep
launching into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can create such a dense environment
above the planet that inevitable collisions could cause a cascading
effect. The space junk and shrapnel generated by one collision could
make further collisions much more possible. And if you have enough
collisions, the amount of space debris could overwhelm the orbital space
entirely.

What makes that situation possible is the fact that there are millions
of micrometeoroids as well as man-made debris that is already orbiting
Earth. The danger posed by even a small fragment that's traveling at
high speeds is easy to see. As calculated by NASA, a 1-centimeter "paint
fleck" traveling at 10km/s (22,000 mph) can cause the same damage as a
550-pound object traveling 60 miles per hour on Earth. If the size of
the shard was increased to 10 centimeters, such a projectile would have
the force of 7 kilograms of TNT. Now imagine thousands of such objects
flying around at breakneck speeds and crashing into each other.

[If a **chain reaction** of **exploding space junk** did
occur]{.underline}, filling the orbital area with such dangerous debris,
[the space program would]{.underline} indeed [be in
**jeopardy**]{.underline}. [Travel that goes beyond the
LEO]{.underline}, like the planned mission to Mars, [would be made more
**challenging**]{.underline} but still conceivably possible.

As I write these words, [suns are illuminating]{.underline} and heating
empty rooms, [unused energy is being flushed down black holes, and our
great common endowment of negentropy is being irreversibly degraded into
entropy on a cosmic scale. These are resources that an advanced
civilization could have used]{.underline} to create value-structures,
such as sentient beings living worthwhile lives. The rate of this loss
boggles the mind. One recent paper speculates, [using]{.underline} loose
theoretical [considerations based on the rate of increase of entropy,
that [the loss of]{.mark} potential [**human lives** in]{.mark}
[our]{.mark} own galactic [supercluster is at least]{.mark} \~**[10\^46
per century of delayed colonization]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\[1\]
[This]{.underline} estimate [assumes]{.underline} that all the [lost
entropy could have been used for productive purposes]{.underline},
although no currently known technological mechanisms are even remotely
capable of doing that. Since the estimate is meant to be a lower bound,
this radically unconservative assumption is undesirable. [[We
can]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[get a lower
bound]{.underline}]{.mark} more straightforwardly [[by]{.mark} simply
[counting]{.mark} the number or [stars in our]{.mark} galactic
[supercluster]{.mark} [and multiplying]{.mark} this number [with the
amount of **computing power** that the **resources of each star** could
be used to generate]{.mark} using technologies for whose feasibility a
strong case has already been made. We can then divide this total with
the estimated amount of computing power needed to simulate one human
life.]{.underline} As a rough approximation, let us say the Virgo
Supercluster contains 10\^13 stars. One estimate of the computing power
extractable from a star and with an associated planet-sized
computational structure, using advanced molecular nanotechnology\[2\],
is 10\^42 operations per second.\[3\] A typical estimate of the human
brain's processing power is roughly 10\^17 operations per second or
less.\[4\] Not much more seems to be needed to simulate the relevant
parts of the environment in sufficient detail to enable the simulated
minds to have experiences indistinguishable from typical current human
experiences.\[5\] Given these estimates, it follows that [the potential
for [approximately 10\^38 human lives is lost every century that
colonization]{.mark} of our local supercluster [is delayed]{.mark};
[or]{.mark} equivalently, about [10\^31]{.mark} potential human [lives
per second]{.mark}.]{.underline} While this estimate is conservative in
that it assumes only computational mechanisms whose implementation has
been at least outlined in the literature, it is useful to have an even
more conservative estimate that does not assume a non-biological
instantiation of the potential persons. Suppose that about 10\^10
biological humans could be sustained around an average star. Then the
Virgo Supercluster could contain 10\^23 biological humans. This
corresponds to a loss of potential equal to about 10\^14 potential human
lives per second of delayed colonization. What matters for present
purposes is not the exact numbers but the fact that they are huge. [Even
with the most conservative estimate, assuming a biological
implementation of all persons, the [potential for **one hundred
trillion**]{.mark} potential **[human beings is lost]{.mark}** for every
second of postponement of colonization of our
supercluster.]{.underline}\[6\]

II\. THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF DELAYED COLONIZATION

From a utilitarian perspective, [this huge loss of **potential human
lives** constitutes a correspondingly huge loss of **potential
value**]{.underline}. I am assuming here that the human lives that could
have been created would have been worthwhile ones. Since it is commonly
supposed that even current human lives are typically worthwhile, this is
a weak assumption. [Any civilization advanced enough to colonize the
local supercluster would likely also have the ability to
establish]{.underline} at least the minimally [**favorable conditions**
required for **future lives** to be **worth living**]{.underline}.

[The effect on **total value**]{.underline}, then, [seems greater for
actions that **accelerate technological development** than
for]{.underline} practically [any other possible action]{.underline}.
[Advancing tech]{.underline}nology (or its enabling factors, such as
economic productivity) [even by such a tiny amount that it leads to
colonization]{.underline} of the local supercluster [just **one second
earlier** than would otherwise have happened amounts to bringing about
more than **10\^29 human lives**]{.underline} (or 10\^14 human lives if
we use the most conservative lower bound) [that would not otherwise have
existed]{.underline}. Few other philanthropic causes could hope to match
that level of utilitarian payoff.

Utilitarians are not the only ones who should strongly oppose
astronomical waste. There are many views about what has value that would
concur with the assessment that the current rate of wastage constitutes
an enormous loss of potential value. For example, [we can take a thicker
conception of human welfare than commonly supposed by
utilitarians]{.underline} (whether of a hedonistic, experientialist, or
desire-satisfactionist bent), [such as a conception that locates value
also in **human flourishing**]{.underline}, meaningful relationships,
noble character, individual expression, aesthetic appreciation, and so
forth. [So long as the **evaluation function** is
aggregative]{.underline} (does not count one person's welfare for less
just because there are many other persons in existence who also enjoy
happy lives) [and is not relativized to a particular point in
time]{.underline} (no time-discounting), [the **conclusion will
hold**]{.underline}.

[These conditions can be relaxed **further**]{.underline}. [Even if the
**welfare function** is not perfectly aggregative]{.underline} (perhaps
because one component of the good is diversity, the marginal rate of
production of which might decline with increasing population size), [it
can still yield a similar bottom line]{.underline} provided only that at
least some significant component of the good is sufficiently
aggregative. Similarly, [some degree of time-discounting future goods
could be accommodated **without changing the
conclusion**]{.underline}.\[7\]

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Good\-\--AT: Aliens

#### Aliens [don't exist]{.underline}\-\--[new studies]{.underline} disprove

**Redd, 18**---Space.com contributor, citing Anders Sandberg,
philosopher at the University of Oxford (Nolan Taylor, "Alien Life May
Be Rare in Our Galaxy Today,"
<https://www.space.com/41080-alien-life-may-be-rare-today.html>)

The hunt for E.T. may have gotten more difficult. [[New research
suggests]{.mark} that [alien]{.mark} life **may [not]{.mark}
be**]{.underline} as **[[widespread]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we had
hoped. When it comes to hunting for alien civilizations, [a key question
is how plentiful intelligent extraterrestrials are in the universe ---
but the answer to that [question depends on]{.mark} a lot of [knowledge
scientists **don\'t have**]{.mark} **yet**]{.underline}. In 1960, Frank
Drake, an astronomer and hunter of extraterrestrial intelligence,
devised an equation to calculate the probability of hearing from an
intelligent, communicating alien civilization. The Drake equation relies
on the values of several constants to determine how widespread such
civilizations might be, how likely they are to evolve and how likely
they are to have broadcast when we were able to detect. While some of
the numbers, such as how many stars have planets around them, are fairly
well-known, others, such as the fraction of those worlds with life,
remain uncertain. \[The Father of SETI: Q&A with Astronomer Frank
Drake\] [Over the years, scientists have attempted to \"solve\" the
Drake equation. But the [uncertain quantities required
**estimation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Optimists tended to put in numbers
that would reflect their thoughts --- life on other planets is
plentiful! Civilizations last for millions of years! Pessimists skew
their results the other way, assuming life is rare and civilizations
quickly burn out. Searching for a more accurate answer to the question
\'Are we alone?\' the new study\'s researchers have included the
uncertainties of the numbers --- how confident scientists are in them.
Rather than giving each component a hard-and-fast amount, they attempted
to gauge the strength of the research into these questions. \"We can
show that, given current scientific uncertainty, we get a distribution
that could make both the optimists and pessimists happy at the same
time: a fair chance of several alien civilizations, but also a fair
chance of no aliens within the visible universe,\" Anders Sandberg told
Space.com by email. Sandberg, a philosopher at the University of Oxford,
is the lead author on the new research. \"The uncertain sky should not
be surprising given our level of uncertainty,\" Sandberg said. The
study, which is available on the preprint site Arxiv, has been submitted
to the journal Royal Society of London A. Alone in the universe? In
1950, Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi looked to the skies and
asked, \"Where are they?\" If the universe is filled with alien
civilizations, why have none of them contacted Earth? The question,
referred to as the Fermi paradox, provided the fuel for the Drake
equation. The Drake equation has never sought a definite number.
Instead, it has been used to make a rough estimate of the number of
detectable civilizations in the Milky Way (N). According to the
equation, N = RfpncflfifcL That number is based on the rate of star
formation per year (R), the fraction of stars with planets (fp), the
number of habitable planets per system of planets (nc), the fraction of
those planets with life (fl), the fraction of life that is intelligent
(fi), the fraction of intelligent civilizations that are detectable
(fc), and the average lifetime of such civilizations in years (L).
Observations of distant stars, with instruments such as NASA\'s Kepler
telescope, have revealed that planets are plentiful around stars, and
habitable worlds are spread across the galaxy. All the other variables
remain up in the air. \[The Most Intriguing Alien Planet Discoveries of
2017\] [Sandberg and his colleagues decided to [**change the inputs**
for the unknown parts of the equation. Rather than estimating]{.mark} a
single number, they **[included the range]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
instance, saying that there is a 1/100 chance for life to evolve
doesn\'t make it clear whether the odds are exactly 1 out of 100,
between 1/1000 and 1/10, or between one and one in a googol (10\^100),
Sandberg said. \"One of the features that differs in \[[the **[new
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}\] from previous Fermi paradox analyses
is that the current authors [tackle the problem of order-of-magnitude
uncertainties in each component of Drake\'s equation in a
[**less-biased**, **more robust way**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Ian
Jordan, an astronomer and engineer at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, told Space.com in an email. Jordan is not part
of the new research. By factoring in the scientific uncertainty for
components like how often life evolves, [the researchers determined that
[the odds that we are the **only intelligent life** in the Milky
Way]{.mark} range between **53** and **[99.6 percent]{.mark}**. The odds
get a bit better when they include [the observable universe]{.mark} ---
the chance that humanity is alone ranges between **39** and **[85
percent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The research was published on the
journal preprint server arXiv. The new numbers mean there\'s a good
chance humanity is the only detectable intelligent civilization around.
Sandberg doesn\'t necessarily think that\'s a bad thing.

#### If they did exist, they would've [already colonized us]{.underline}\-\--finite resources on home planets

**Bostrom, '8** Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, a
Ph.D. degree in philosophy from the London School of Economics, and was
a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford, 2008,
"Where Are They?: Why I Hope The Search For Extraterrestrial Life Finds
Nothing", MIT Technology Review,
<https://nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf>, EO

I will return to this scenario shortly, but first I shall say a few
words about another [theoretical [possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}:
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[extraterrestrials are out
there]{.underline}]{.mark}, in abundance but hidden from our view. I
think [this [is]{.mark} [unlikely, because if extraterrestrials do
exist]{.mark}]{.underline} in any numbers, [it's [reasonable to think at
least one species would have already expanded]{.mark} throughout the
galaxy]{.underline}, or beyond. [Yet we have met no one]{.underline}.
Various schemes have been proposed for how an intelligent species might
colonize space. They might send out "manned" space ships, which would
establish colonies and "terraform" new planets, beginning with worlds in
their own solar system before moving on to more distant destinations.
But much more likely, in my view, would be colonization by means of
so‐called "von Neumann probes", named after the Hungarian‐ born prodigy
John von Neumann, who included among his many mathematical and
scientific achievements the development of the concept of a universal
constructor. A von Neumann probe would be an unmanned self‐replicating
spacecraft, controlled by artificial intelligence, capable of
interstellar travel. A probe would land on a planet (or a moon or
asteroid), where it would mine raw materials to create multiple replicas
of itself, perhaps using advanced forms of nanotechnology. These
replicas would then be launched in various directions, thus setting in
motion a multiplying colonization wave. 3 Our galaxy is about 100,000
light years across. If a probe were capable of travelling at one‐tenth
of the speed of light, [[every planet in the galaxy
could]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[be colonized]{.mark} within a couple
of million years]{.underline} (allowing some time for the bootstrapping
process that needs to take place between a probe's landing on a resource
site, setting up the necessary infrastructure, and producing daughter
probes). If travel speed were limited to 1% of light speed, colonization
might take twenty million years instead. [The exact numbers do not
matter much because they are [at]{.mark} any [rate]{.mark} very [short
compared to the]{.mark} astronomical [time]{.mark} scales [involved in
the evolution of intelligent life]{.mark} from scratch]{.underline}
([billions of years]{.underline}). If building a von Neumann probe seems
like a very difficult thing to do---well, surely it is, but we are not
talking about a proposal for something that NASA or the European Space
Agency should get to work on today. Rather, we are considering what
would be accomplish with some future very advanced technology. We
ourselves might build Neumann probes in decades, centuries, or
millennia---intervals that are mere blips compared to the lifespan of a
planet. Considering that space travel was science fiction a mere half
century ago, we should, I think, be extremely reluctant to proclaim
something forever technologically infeasible unless it conflicts with
some hard physical constraint. Our early space probes are already out
there: Voyager 1, for example, is now beyond our solar system. Even if
an advanced technological civilization could spread throughout the
galaxy in a relatively short period of time (and thereafter spread to
neighboring galaxies), one might still wonder whether it would opt to do
so. Perhaps it would rather choose to stay at home and live in harmony
with nature. However, there are a number of considerations that make
this a less plausible explanation of the great silence. First, we
observe that [[life]{.mark} here on Earth [manifests a]{.mark} very
[strong tendency to spread]{.mark} wherever it can]{.underline}. On our
planet, life has spread to every nook and cranny that can sustain it:
East, West, North, and South; land, water, and air; desert, tropic, and
arctic ice; underground rocks, hydrothermal vents, and radioactive waste
dumps; there are even living beings inside the bodies of other living
beings. [This empirical finding is]{.underline} of course entirely
[[consonant with]{.mark} what one would expect on the basis of
[elementary evolutionary theory]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, if we
consider our own species in particular, we also find that it has spread
to every part of the planet, and we even have even established a
presence in space, at vast expense, with the international space
station. Third, [there is an obvious reason for an advanced civilization
that has the technology to go into [space]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively cheaply to do so: namely[, that's [where]{.mark} most of [the
resources are.]{.mark} [Land, minerals, energy, negentropy, matter: all
abundant out there yet limited on any one]{.mark} home [planet]{.mark}.
These resources could be used to support a growing population and to
construct giant temples or supercomputers or whatever structures a
civilization values]{.underline}. Fourth, even if some advanced
civilization were non‐expansionary to begin with, it might change its
mind after a hundred years or fifty thousand years---a delay too short
to matter. Fifth, even if some advanced civilization chose to remain
non‐expansionist forever, it would still not make any difference [[if
there were at least one other civilization]{.mark} out there
[that]{.mark} at some point [opted to launch]{.mark} a
[colonization]{.mark} process: that expansionary civilization would then
be the one whose [probes, colonies, or descendants would fill the
galaxy]{.mark}.]{.underline} It takes but one match to start a fire;
only one expansionist civilization to launch the colonization of the
universe.

The spirit of the Apollo program inspired us to tackle a huge challenge
as one species, to test our limits, work together and sacrifice in order
to achieve great heights. [The benefits are numerous including
[**medical breakthroughs** enabled by space tech]{.mark}nology
[advances]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Discoveries in **space robotics** and **new materials** propelled the
field of **prosthetics**]{.underline}, [improving the quality of life
for many]{.underline}. In my own backyard Drs. Michael DeBakey and
George Noon worked with NASA engineers to develop the first Left
Ventricular Assist Device that saved the lives of thousands awaiting
heart transplants. [Millions of **cancer patients** depend on the
digital imaging techniques developed by the space program to enhance
**MRI** and **computerized tomography**]{.underline}
(**[CT]{.underline}**) scans so that we can detect tumors early, or
better yet, that there are not any to find at all.

Though many do not realize it, [humans have been living and working in
space continuously for the past two decades.]{.underline} [The
conditions of **[spaceflight]{.mark}** have [**accelerated** our ability
to study]{.mark}]{.underline} progressive degenerative
[[diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This **novel paradigm** of
[understanding]{.mark} **[human physiology]{.mark}** under the stresses
of [living in space]{.mark} holds **great [promise]{.mark}** for
**[new]{.mark} sources** of **[medical breakthroughs]{.mark}** for
Earth]{.underline}.

Although astronauts are carefully selected to be exceptionally healthy
and exhibit peak physical and mental performance, after only four to six
months in space, they can develop numerous medical conditions. Without
appropriate exercise, they lose bone and muscle mass. They become prone
to developing kidney stones. Their hearts become deconditioned. Their
blood vessels stiffen. A subset of astronauts develop a swelling of the
optic nerve and possibly an increase in pressure on the brain. Even
dormant viruses become activated, alongside changes to the immune
system. [There is a **sense of urgency** to solve these
problems]{.underline} if we are to send humans to Mars and return them
safely in the next decade or two.

This is why [[NASA is investing]{.mark} [in **cutting-edge
research**]{.mark} [for human health and performance]{.mark} including
**high-risk [high-reward]{.mark} approaches** funded through the
Translational Research institute for Space Health]{.underline} (TRISH).

[Supporting]{.underline} potentially [**[ground-breaking
innovations]{.mark}** [requires]{.mark} a **leap of faith** in the right
direction]{.underline}.

Keeping astronauts healthy during deep [[space
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark} missions --- where there are no
hospitals and no medical specialists --- requires a different paradigm
for healthcare. Astronauts are typically engineers and scientists, and
only occasionally physicians.

On the way to Mars, when communications with Earth will be limited, they
could be forced to act as both patients and healthcare providers. If a
medical condition is allowed to progress when they are millions of miles
away from Earth, the situation could become catastrophic.

[Therefore, [astronauts]{.mark} will need to [detect]{.mark} even the
[most subtle changes]{.mark} in their own health status [early enough to
prevent disease]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This requires a
healthcare paradigm of predicting, preventing and mitigating ailments by
intervening early.

This means enabling monitoring, diagnostic and therapeutic medical
capabilities that are simple to use, safe, robust and miniaturized.
Additionally, [what will work in a small [spacecraft]{.mark} in the
hands of an engineer is also likely to work in a community clinic with
[limited resource]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Or even in our homes. [This
different **[approach]{.mark}** to **healthcare** can help **[save
lives]{.mark}** and reduce costs]{.underline} --- [[at a **global
level**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Space **demands**]{.mark} the best in **[healthcare
innovations]{.mark}**, [focusing on **prevention** and **early**]{.mark}
**[intervention]{.mark}** using smart, creative solutions.]{.underline}
On a mission to Mars, [blood tests will be done in a matter of
**minutes**]{.underline}, by the patient, on a single drop of blood. A
[trained and adaptive computer algorithm will track health status based
on a variety of physiological parameters and alert astronauts when
important deviations from normal become evident]{.underline}.

Automated eye exams will be performed by the astronauts on themselves
and images will be analyzed by a computer for changes. Customized
medications will be tailor-made for the patient on the spot. If a minor
medical procedure is required, the caregiver will learn and practice
beforehand using augmented reality tools and software simulations
adjusted for zero-gravity.

Kidney stones will be found early and treated quickly and painlessly
using ultrasound to "push" them out of the kidney so they can be cleared
naturally with urination. [Sleep and mood will be improved using **sound
stimulation** and health will be improved by **individualized diets**
which will be **enriched** with **high-nutrient plants** grown
efficiently within a small footprint.]{.underline} Most importantly,
[[all]{.mark} these [advances have]{.mark} clear and **important
[applications]{.mark}** [on Earth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Space exploration]{.mark} has [already yielded **hundreds of
inventions**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} filled our arsenal for **fighting
diseases**]{.underline}. To land women and men on Mars and return them
healthy, [we must reinvent healthcare]{.underline}. [The **positive
consequences** of this work will **[impact all of
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The spirit of Apollo is alive and well
in space health research today. And [for science, **medicine** and
**technology pioneers**, our **most important work** is still
ahead]{.underline}.

[differences]{.mark} between humans and the rest of the animals [that

nevertheless [it is extremely valuable because it lets us predict the

require the right anterior insula, a part of the brain cortex that
evolved very rapidly in apes. The function of the right anterior insula
is to create hypothetical models of the internal state of our body in
different circumstances (Craig, 2010, 2011). For example, when we
imagine what it would feel like to stab our toe, is the right anterior
insula doing that. Likewise, the right anterior insula can make a model
of the internal state of the body of another person. Of course, theory
of mind is much more than that and involves the cognitive abilities of
many other parts of the brain. [**Research** on theory of mind has
revealed it to be **[uniquely human]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Penn and
Povinelli, 2007), although some studies claims to have found it in
rudimentary form in chimpanzees (Call and Tomasello, 2008; Yamamoto et
al., 2013). [[One negative aspect]{.mark} of theory of mind [is]{.mark}
that [it]{.mark} often [creates the **delusion** of attributing]{.mark}
[human **consciousness** to inanimate objects or animals]{.mark}. The
same way we project our thoughts and feelings to a person that we see
behaving in a way similar to us, we project human thoughts and feelings
to an animal or an object we see doing something that resembles human
behavior. [This delusional form of theory]{.mark} of mind [is
responsible for]{.mark} the anthropomorphizing of animals that is so
common in modern culture. **[Episodic memory]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There are two basic forms of memory: procedural and
declarative]{.underline} \[pp. 303-306 in (Gazzaniga, 2008)\].
[Procedural memory is present in both humans and animals and consists in
the retention of perceptual, motor and cognitive skills that are then
expressed non-consciously]{.underline}. For example, when we walk, swim,
ski, listen to music, type on a keyboard or process the visual
information we get from a television screen, we use procedural memory.
[Declarative memory stores information about facts and beliefs about the
world, and can be further divided into semantic and episodic
memory]{.underline}. [Semantic memory is about facts in the world that
stand by themselves, independently of our self, whereas **episodic
memory**]{.underline} is [remembering things that happened to
us]{.underline}. [That is, episodic memory retains events as they were
experienced by ourselves in a particular place and time. [Episodic
memory]{.mark} appears to be **uniquely human**, because it [involves
**subjective experiences**]{.mark}, a **concept of self** and
**subjective time**. This is important because it allows us to travel
mentally in time through subjective experiences, while animals are
**locked in the present** of their current motivational state. **Humans
emotions**]{.underline}. Mammals, birds and some other animals have a
set of six basic emotions listed by Ekman: anger, fear, disgust, joy,
sadness and surprise. However, we humans are able to feel many other
emotions that regulate our social behavior and the way we view the
world: guilt, shame, pride, honor, awe, interest, envy, nostalgia, hope,
despair, contempt and many others. While emotions like love and loyalty
may be present in mammals that live in hierarchical societies, [emotions
like guilt, shame and their counterparts pride and honor seem to be
uniquely human]{.underline}. [There is much controversy these days on
whether dogs feel guilt and shame, there is evidence that they do not,
but they may also have acquired this emotion as a way to interact with
humans. [What]{.mark} is clear is that many of the emotions that [we
value as human are **not present in
animals**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [**Empathy** and
**compassion**]{.underline}. [Empathy is defined as the capacity to feel
what another person is feeling from their own frame of
reference]{.underline}. [It is a well-established fact that many animals
react to distress by other animals by showing signs of distress
themselves. However, this does not seem to represent true empathy as
defined above, but a genetically encoded stress response in anticipation
of harm]{.underline}. [Since empathy requires feeling what the other
person is feeling from **their own frame of reference**, it seems to
require **theory of mind**]{.underline}. Only if we stripe the
requirement of adopting the other's frame of reference we can say that
animals have empathy. Empathy involves the newly evolved anterior insula
in humans (Preis et al., 2013), bonobos and chimpanzees (Rilling et al.,
2012). [**Compassion** is currently thought to be different from empathy
because it involves many other parts of the brain. It seems to be
associated with **complex cultural and cognitive elements**. Therefore,
it seems safe to assume that [animals are not able to feel
compassion]{.mark}. Language and culture]{.underline}. Although animals
do communicate with each other using sounds, signs and body language,
[human language is a qualitative leap from any form of animal
communication in its unique ability to convey factual information and
not just emotional states]{.underline}. In that, human language is
linked to our ability to store huge amounts of semantic and episodic
memory, as defined above. The human brain has a unique capacity to
quickly learn spoken languages during a portal that closes around 5-6
years of age. Attempts to teach sign languages to apes has produced only
limited success and can be attributed to a humanization of the brain of
those animals, raised inside human culture. [The effectiveness of spoken
and written language to store information across many generations gave
raise to human cultures]{.underline}. The working of the human brain
cannot be understood without taking culture into account. [Culture
completely shapes the way we think, feel, perceive and
behave]{.underline}. Although there are documented cases of transmission
of learned information across generations in animals, producing what we
could call an animal culture, [[**no animal** is as **shaped by
culture** as we are.]{.mark}]{.underline} Esthetic sense or the
**[appreciation of beauty]{.underline}** also [seems to be uniquely
human]{.underline}. Of course, animals can produce great beauty in the
form of colorful bodies, songs and artful behavior. [What seems to be
lacking is their ability to appreciate and value that beauty beyond
stereotypical mating and territorial behaviors. Even attempts to teach
chimps to produce art by drawing have largely failed]{.underline}.
[**[Ethics]{.mark}** is the ability to appreciate **fairness**,
**justice** and **rights**]{.underline}. It is at the very core of our
ability to form stable societies and to cooperate to achieve common
goals. [It [depends on **theory of mind**]{.mark} (which allows us to
"put ourselves in somebody else's shoes"); on **social emotions** like
guilt, shame, pride and contempt; on empathy and **compassion**, and on
**cultural heritage**]{.underline}. [Lacking all those mental abilities,
animals have **no sense of ethics**]{.underline}. Even though some
studies have shown that monkeys have a primitive sense of fairness
(particularly when it applies to their own interest), it is but a pale
anticipation of our sense of justice. It simply goes to show how that
ethics is rooted in our evolutionary history. [The fact that animals
cannot even **remotely comprehend** the concept of rights is a strong
argument for why they should not have rights. What sense does it make to
give animals something that they do not know that they
lack?]{.underline} Extended consciousness. They question of what is
consciousness has been called by scientists and philosophers "the hard
problem" due to the difficulty of answering it (Blackmore, 2004).
Therefore, the related question of whether animals have consciousness,
or what animals have it, remains similarly unanswered in the strict
sense. [However, based on their behavior, we commonly assume that
animals like cats, dogs and horses are conscious and able to make some
autonomous decisions]{.underline}. On the other hand, unless we invoke
some mystical definition of consciousness, [it is safe to assume that
animals with small nervous systems, like jellyfish, worms, starfish,
snails and clams have no consciousness whatsoever. They are like plants:
living beings able to react to the environment as
automatons]{.underline}. That leaves a lot of animals for which it is
hard to guess whether they are conscious or not: insects, fish, octopi,
lizards and small mammals like mice and rats. [What has been becoming
clear is that we [humans possess a **kind of consciousness** that no
other animal has]{.mark}: the ability to **see ourselves as selves**
extending from the **past** to the **future**]{.underline} \[pp. 309-321
(Gazzaniga, 2008)\]. [This special kind of consciousness has been called
by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio "extended consciousness" \[Chapter 7
in (Damasio, 1999)\] and allow us a sort of "mental time travel" to
relive events in the past and predict what may happen to us in the
future]{.underline} (Suddendorf and Corballis, 2007). [Extended
consciousness is based on our ability to have episodic memory and theory
of mind. Episodic memory configures remembered events around the image
of the self, whereas theory of mind allows us to create a model of our
own mind as it was during a past event or to hypothesize how it would be
in a future event. I should also point out that a few animals (apes,
dolphins and elephants) may turn out to have episodic memory, theory of
mind and hence extended consciousness. However, this is still very much
in doubt. **Suffering** and **happiness**]{.underline}. [It is a common
mistake to **confuse suffering with pain and happiness with
joy**]{.underline}. [Pain is the representation of a bodily state and
the emotion associated with it (Craig, 2003). Likewise, joy is an
emotion associated with an excited but pleasant body state in an
agreeable environment]{.underline}. [Suffering and happiness are much
deeper than that, and refer to **the totality of a mental state**,
encompassing **cognition**, **emotion** and state of
**consciousness**]{.underline}. Although suffering and happiness are
normally associated with certain emotions, there is not always a
correspondence with them. [For example, one can be happy while feeling
scared or sad]{.underline}, [or suffer even in the presence of a passing
joy]{.underline}. [The error of philosophers like Peter
**Singer**]{.underline} (Singer, 1991) [and]{.underline} Tom
**[Reagan]{.underline}** (Reagan, 1985) [is that they consider suffering
as something that occurs independently of cognition and other mental
abilities]{.underline}, **[when it does not]{.underline}**. Arguably,
[**happiness** and **suffering** require some **continuity in time**,
which would seem to require **extended consciousness**]{.underline}.
Furthermore, conceptions of happiness extending to antiquity refer to
lifelong attitudes like hedonism (the quest for personal pleasure) and
eudemonia ([working to acquire **virtue** or to **achieve goals** that
transcend oneself]{.underline}), [point]{.underline}ing [to the fact
that **human happiness depends on cultural values**]{.underline}. [In
view of all this, we need to wonder whether happiness and suffering can
exist in beings that have no episodic memory, no extended consciousness,
no sense of self, and no culture. Can happiness and suffering really be
attributed to animals lacking these mental abilities?]{.underline} [Or
is this an **illusion** , an anthropomorphizing caused by the
overreaching of our theory of mind? Without going to that extreme, it is
quite clear that we humans have a capacity to be happy and to suffer
that goes **far beyond what animals can experience**. So [human
suffering **counts more** than any suffering than an animal could
have]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are many more differences between human
and animals. However, the ones that I have listed here are important
because they give us our special feeling of humaneness. All of them are
based on scientific facts about the human mind that are slowly being
unraveled by neuroscience, not on religious beliefs or on ideology.
However, what cannot be based on science is the value we attribute to
those differences. Ultimately, this is a decision based on our ethical
intuition. Still, for most people what determines how much consideration
we should give to a being is its ability to be conscious; to feel
empathy; to feel guilt and pride and shame and all other human emotions;
to be happy as we are happy and to suffer like we suffer. [An important
corollary of the ideas proposed here is to utterly **refute the
"marginal case" argument**. Thus, even when a human brain is damaged by
disease, accident or old age, most of the properties that I have listed
here **remain** because they are deeply engrained in the way the human
brain works]{.underline}. [Theory of mind and extended consciousness
appear early in human life and are the last things to go in a
deteriorating brain]{.underline}. It takes coma to deprive us of them.
[A person may have a reduced intelligence or other cognitive
disabilities, but s/he still has theory of mind, empathy, compassion,
extended consciousness and all those human emotions. That is why when we
encounter those people we recognize them as humans and we know we should
treat them as humans]{.underline}. **[They are not animals and should
never be treated as such]{.underline}**. [Intelligence is just a tiny
part of what it means to be human.]{.underline}

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Good\-\--AT: Universe destruction

#### There's [no chance]{.underline} that [anything]{.underline} we do could [possibly]{.underline} destroy the Universe

Stephen [Hawking's recent remarks regarding the possibility that our
descendants might one day destroy the universe by disrupting the Higgs
field with a]{.underline} larger-than-Earth [supercollider has gotten
people thinking: [is there anything we could do]{.mark} now
[that]{.mark} would [destroy the universe?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The answer to that question is, by all appearances, a pretty clear
**[no]{.mark}**. Here are two good reasons why:]{.underline}

[[1. The universe is **really, really durable**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Last April, astronomers witnessed [gamma-ray burst]{.mark}]{.underline}
(GRB) 130427A and, short of being bigger than other gamma ray bursts
they'd observed, it wasn't particularly remarkable: just [[a
star]{.mark} 20 to [30 times the Sun]{.mark}'s mass collapsing and
[exploding]{.mark} in a way we can't fully understand, [creating a black
hole]{.mark} and outshining local objects from millions of light years
away. This sort of thing [happens]{.mark} fairly **[regularly]{.mark}**
all over the universe, and was presumably more common for most of the
universe's history.]{.underline}

[Although [these]{.mark} gamma-ray bursts [occur on a **scale**]{.mark}
and [with]{.mark} a [**power** that **exponentially exceeds**]{.mark}
**anything humanity can produce** (**and [anything humanity is likely to
produce for a very long time]{.mark}**), [they **don't**]{.mark}
**appear to [do any]{.mark} tangible [harm]{.mark}** to the structure of
the universe itself.]{.underline}

[[2. We don't have]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nology [to do anything
the]{.mark} natural [world isn't already doing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[If we can't endanger the universe with raw explosive power, can we can
endanger it by tinkering with the natural order of things? Maybe, if we
ever figure out how, but [everything humanity has]{.mark} ever
[done]{.mark} so far [has **fallen well within**]{.mark} **the
parameters of [the natural order]{.mark}** of things.]{.underline}

[Even nuclear [fission]{.mark}]{.underline}, the go-to example of
humanity harnessing the power of the gods, [[is nothing new]{.mark}; it
occurred naturally in 17 underground sites in West Africa two billion
years ago, no Manhattan Project needed. And the
**[L]{.mark}**]{.underline}arge **[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}**adron
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ollider, wonderful though it is, [just
[stimulates]{.mark} weak, observable versions of [processes]{.mark} that
[natural]{.mark}ly occur [in]{.mark} local [space]{.mark} on a regular
basis. There is,]{.underline} in the words of Ecclesiastes, [nothing new
under the Sun. All we're ultimately doing is rearranging our
environment, much like other nestmaking animals do; we have yet to
create anything that is, in a cosmic sense, out of the ordinary. And as
[the universe is **unlikely to be destroyed** by something]{.mark} that
[it ordinarily produces]{.mark} on its own, **[it should be
safe]{.mark}** from us [for a **long time**]{.mark} **to
come**]{.underline}.

### SSA ADV\-\--SC Good\-\--AT: War

#### No interstellar war -- required technology and incentives for war don't align

4\. Interstellar warfare: fantasy and real fantasy Even if we accept --
in spirit, if not in words -- Clarke's Third Law ("any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"; Clarke, 1999), the
inverse does not hold: there are infinitely many conceivable "magical"
effects which could not be realized with any advanced technology under
the known laws of physics. As stated above, [[it is
doubtful**,**]{.mark} **to say at least**, that [there ever will be a
"galaxy destroying weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}[",]{.mark} irrespectively
of how much time and effort is expended. The influence of science
fictional discourse, while in general beneficial for futures studies,
becomes at this point perhaps too strong (especially in a rather naïve,
Star Wars- or Starship Troopers-like manner). The discussion might be
finished here, since it seems unreasonable to engage in such extreme
speculation; so, a few comments in the rest of this section should be
taken with reservations. Although there have not been serious strategic
studies of the topic, [there are many indications that the
["interstellar warfare" is an oxymoron]{.mark}]{.underline}. Insofar as
[there are no topological shortcuts in forms of traversable
wormholes]{.underline} (and even if there are some, but with fixed
points of entrance and egress), [[there is a large delay]{.mark} and
logistic nightmare [in sending]{.mark} any [military]{.mark} expeditions
across [interstellar distances]{.mark}]{.underline}. Except in the case
of huge technological imbalance -- which is possible in contact between
(post)human and some extraterrestrial civilization, but highly unlikely
if not impossible between any two (post)human factions -- [the defense
of planetary systems would have overwhelming advantage]{.underline},
**[measured by orders of magnitude]{.underline}** [in both
reconnaissance, logistics, and capacity for tactical concentration of
forces]{.underline}. Above all, [[the defenders could]{.mark} easily
[destroy]{.mark} any [non-stellar resources]{.mark} in the defended
system]{.underline} if their situation becomes desperate enough, [so
that ["piracy and plunder" would]{.mark} simply [not be]{.mark}
[viable]{.mark} options]{.underline} in the interstellar case. And, if
the desired resources consist of uplifted stellar matter, there would
always be billions of undefended stars in the Galaxy. (This would be
valid even if the efficiency of colonization is 99%. In the unlikely
scenario that all stars in the Galaxy are colonized and defended, which
is perhaps in itself incompatible with the Torres's argument, since the
constant destructive warfare will likely impede or arrest the
colonization efforts, the required timescale is so long that it will
perhaps make more economic and strategic sense to go after undefended
resources in other Local Group galaxies.) In brief, [plunder is hardly
viable as a motivation for interstellar warfare]{.underline}. [A
reasonable conclusion that interstellar travel will always be expensive
and difficult, coupled with the defensive advantages and the total
abundance of undefended cosmic resources elsewhere**, makes this
motivation of "Machiavellian actors" largely irrelevant.**]{.underline}
"Tuckerian actors" have been dealt with in the Section 2 above. Finally,
there remains the option of warfare for the sake of spreading particular
"bad memes" (Zubrin, 1999). If this kind of motivation requires the same
expenditure of time and resources required for the interstellar travel
(not to mention intergalactic travel, which is an entirely different
order of magnitude problem, with additional difficulties, like the
impossibility of gathering any fuel or resources en route), it is
reasonable to conclude that such instances would be rare. Of course, [it
is impossible to eliminate the possibility that particularly virulent
political or religious movements will emerge in the distant
future]{.underline}, leading to an overwhelming motivation for spreading
The Word by fire and sword even in the face of unfavorable strategic
odds. [This seems improbable]{.underline}, however, [for at least two
reasons]{.underline}. (i) [The relevant "[bad memes" will]{.mark}
certainly [be easier to spread by other means]{.mark}]{.underline},
notably modulated radiation and inscribed matter packages, in forms of
self-reproducing software or other virulent forms, [which might be
violent in a generalized sense]{.underline}, [but still would not entail
any of the drastic scenarios of destruction invoked by
Torres]{.underline}. Insofar human history is any guide, while religions
are stronger in the contemporary world than they have been for the last
couple of centuries, this is manifested by televangelists rather than
crusades.7 (ii) [The immuniz[ation against such bad memes is quite
likely to improve]{.mark} by many orders of magnitude]{.underline}, just
as new computer viruses always provoke stronger and more efficient
immunization response. In this sense, the conclusions of Pinker (2011)
seem fully vindicated; and they are certainly more appropriate for the
interstellar case.

Sir Christopher Harper

Nonresident Senior Fellow, Transatlantic Security Initiative

[The new]{.underline} **[Strat]{.underline}**egic
**[Con]{.underline}**cept is considerably better than I had anticipated
or hoped. It is unambiguous and clear-sighted, which is impressive when
one considers how tricky it must have been to get thirty nations (at
head-of-state-or-government-level) on side with every word, comma, full
stop and nuance. It is a vast improvement on its predecessor which has,
for far too long, been woefully outdated and hence unable to fulfill its
objective of being the Alliance's top-level guide rail.

I would have [liked to have seen more]{.underline}
**[emphasis]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} the rapid
[development]{.underline}, **[deployment]{.underline}** [and
**utilization**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} innovative
[technology]{.underline} [for]{.underline}, inter [alia,]{.underline}
[strategic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[operational]{.underline}**
decision [support]{.underline}. [I would]{.underline} also [have
welcomed a more **decisive**]{.underline} and, if necessary, [**radical
drive** to promote]{.underline} [**standardization** and
**interoperability**]{.underline}. [It is not the **availability** of
intellectual]{.underline} horsepower, disruptive [thinking]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} world-leading [technology]{.underline} that hampers
either of these endeavors, [but rather]{.underline} Alliance
[**bureaucracy** and **risk-aversion**]{.underline}.

Distinctiveness

Is there a clear theme, concept, or label that distinguishes this
strategy from previous strategies?

This Strategic Concept is very clear and unambiguous about the threats,
risks, issues, and challenges that confront the Alliance. It is
refreshing to see adversaries clearly delineated. This is a considerable
improvement on all previous versions.

Sound strategic context

Does the strategy accurately portray the current strategic context and
security environment facing NATO? Is the strategy predicated on any
specious assumptions?

The Strategic Concept offers a realistic and unvarnished perspective of
the current strategic context and of the global security environment.

Defined goals

Does the strategy define clear goals?

Defined goals are arguably more the stuff of plans than strategies. That
said, for a document of this nature, the target setting is adequate.

Clear lines of effort

Does the strategy outline several major lines of effort for achieving
its objectives? Will following those lines of effort attain the defined
goals? Does the strategy establish a clear set of priorities, or does it
present a laundry list of NATO activities?

[The]{.underline} **[Strat]{.underline}**egic **[Con]{.underline}**cept
[does not **prioritize**]{.underline} [or **articulate** a
program]{.underline} [for the **achievement**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [goals]{.underline} or objectives. [In the face
of]{.underline} the [**ever-shifting** sands]{.underline} of the global
defense and security environment, [it is the role of]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} North Atlantic Council (**[NAC]{.underline}**)
[and]{.underline} Military Committee (**[MC]{.underline}**) [to
debate]{.underline} [and **decide these aspects**]{.underline}. The
document is more than adequate in offering the necessary guidance.

Realistic implementation guidelines

Is it feasible to implement this strategy? Are there resources available
to sustain it?

Some might say that the Strategic Concept lacks clarity here. I would
argue that it offers more than enough meat for the NAC and MC to chew
on.

Barry Pavel

Senior Vice President and Director, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security

The new Strategic Concept, which I believe should be updated more
frequently going forward (but may have to endure through the rest of
this decade as that appears to have been the recent practice), is a
relatively solid document that accounts reasonably well for the new and
ever-changing security context, while outlining an executable strategy
for NATO. However, I would have liked to have seen a bit more clarity on
prioritization of threats and on some of the core priorities for how the
strategy can be executed most effectively (e.g., moving from
deterrence-by-retaliation toward deterrence-by-denial).

Distinctiveness

Is there a clear theme, concept, or label that distinguishes this
strategy from previous strategies?

The new Strategic Concept contains a bit more continuity in many of its
elements with the 2010 version than had been expected. While accounting
for the dramatically different security environment---and, for example,
pointing to an enhanced force posture to address it---there was not
really a clear theme, concept, or label.

Sound strategic context

Does the strategy accurately portray the current strategic context and
security environment facing NATO? Is the strategy predicated on any
specious assumptions?

The strategic context section is solid, capturing the Russian threat
very well ("the Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace") and the "systemic
challenges" posed by China, for example. However, I was startled that
the China section was so low on the priority list, coming after
humanitarian and other challenges, and that the threat of terrorism was
so high (coming immediately after Russia). It also would have been good
to have seen a bit of foresight applied, with some projections of where
the security environment might be headed.

Defined goals

Does the strategy define clear goals?

The Strategic Concept did a good job on goals, as it usually does, with
great clarity around the top-level purpose, as well as the priority
objectives of the document

Clear lines of effort

Does the strategy outline several major lines of effort for achieving
its objectives? Will following those lines of effort attain the defined
goals? Does the strategy establish a clear set of priorities, or does it
present a laundry list of NATO activities?

Lines of effort are addressed well, but there does appear to be a
"laundry list" feel to those activities that covers a bit too much
ground. That certainly is to be expected for a document agreed on by 30
nations who share core values and interests but also bring distinct
perspectives to the serious questions of Alliance strategy.

Realistic implementation guidelines

Is it feasible to implement this strategy? Are there resources available
to sustain it?

Fortunately, defense budgets across most of the Alliance are increasing,
which will help NATO members to more effectively execute this broad,
ambitious strategy. However, the devil will be in the details because,
as the Strategic Concept points out, the security environment is
"contested and unpredictable."

Leah Scheunemann

Deputy Director, Transatlantic Security Initiative

Overall, the Strategic Concept keeps the Alliance on its important
trajectory to focus on the direct threat of Russia, recognizes NATO's
global role in preserving liberal democratic values, and adapts to
growing transnational challenges and opportunities like climate change
and technological innovation. Where the strategy is in danger is in
implementation beyond the Madrid Summit and specifically sustaining such
modernization and investments to focus on collective defense. Fingers
crossed that the political leaders remain unified and that the
bureaucracy prevails in implementation over the coming years.

Distinctiveness

Is there a clear theme, concept, or label that distinguishes this
strategy from previous strategies?

This Strategic Concept is definitely distinct from the 2010 version,
which is unsurprising given the many monumental shifts to the security
environment in Europe and globally in the past twelve years. The key
theme of the Strategic Concept is that Russia has shattered peace in
Europe. The Alliance is clearly articulating the threats that NATO
faces, including authoritarian actors, clearly delineating Russia as
NATO's primary threat, but also outlining the "challenges" posed by
China for the first time in a NATO strategy, as well as focusing on
climate change, technological innovation, and new agendas like human
security and women, peace, and security. However, there are several key
areas where NATO maintained continuity with the previous strategy,
including focusing on terrorism and a so-called 360-degree approach
against threats from all directions, even as the threat from NATO's east
looms larger than ever before

Sound strategic context

Does the strategy accurately portray the current strategic context and
security environment facing NATO? Is the strategy predicated on any
specious assumptions?

The Strategic Concept includes a fantastic list of challenges, including
a clear outline of the threat posed by Russia and authoritarian
aggressors in general and pitting NATO as a "a bulwark of the
rules-based international order" in this global competition. There is a
surprisingly stark list of challenges posed by the People's Republic of
China to NATO's "interests, security and values," however it comes after
the mention of terrorism, which rings a bit hollow given the strategic
reality of European NATO members being focused on the war on their
doorstep in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, which receives no mention.
I also think the assessment of the circumstances in which NATO may have
to use nuclear weapons as "extremely remote" is inaccurate given the
overt nuclear modernization, breach of international laws, and
aggressive rhetoric from Russia just this year.

Defined goals

Does the strategy define clear goals?

The Strategic Concept has to be viewed as a top-level document that sets
the stage for follow-on work at all levels of the Alliance and by member
states and one would not demand a list of defined, attainable, or
measurable goals from the document. The Strategic Concept strongly
defines NATO's goal as safeguarding its members and its values and
reaffirmed NATO's three core tasks, in order: deterrence and defense,
crisis management, and cooperative security. I appreciate that the
Strategic Concept did not confuse NATO's purpose with a fourth core task
of resilience and instead wove resilience throughout the strategy as a
core tool and competency for achieving all of NATO's goals, and that the
strategy highlight's NATO's global role, but continues to bite off a lot
to chew in the years to come.

Clear lines of effort

Does the strategy outline several major lines of effort for achieving
its objectives? Will following those lines of effort attain the defined
goals? Does the strategy establish a clear set of priorities, or does it
present a laundry list of NATO activities?

Again, one has to view the Strategic Concept as a top-level strategy
that paves the way for continued adaptation at all levels of the
Alliance. I do think the Strategic Concept will provide the top cover
needed for leaders in key areas to advance necessary adaptations,
specifically on deterrence and defense, where there is a need for NATO
to accelerate its good steps taken since the Russian invasion of Ukraine
in 2014. [The **devil** will really]{.underline} [be in the **details of
implementation**]{.underline}, [only some of which]{.underline} [we have
seen]{.underline} so far [with the **vague announcements**]{.underline}
[of the new]{.underline} **[force model]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
new regional [plans discussed]{.underline} [at the
**summit**]{.underline} [that would **require thousands**
of]{.underline} more ready [troops]{.underline} assigned to NATO
[without an **articulation** of how]{.underline} [readiness will be
**bolstered**]{.underline} [especially]{.underline} [without all
countries]{.underline} [**meeting** a defense]{.underline} [spending
minimum]{.underline}, let alone going above and beyond the notorious 2
percent metric.

Realistic implementation guidelines

Is it feasible to implement this strategy? Are there resources available
to sustain it?

NATO has agreed to a historic new strategy at a time of war on the
European continent at a scale not seen since World War II. I have great
confidence in the many leaders at NATO and throughout the Alliance's
member states to continue to advance and accelerate the changes the
Alliance has made since 2014 to address the renewed threat of a
revisionist Russia, while also tackling new challenges that exacerbate
global insecurity with greater vigor. What I am more pessimistic about
is NATO's ability to sustain upward pressure on defense budgets to
implement this very expensive vision and continue to safeguard
collective security.

Paul R.S. Gebhard

Nonresident Senior Fellow, Transatlantic Security Initiative

NATO has issued a strong, clear statement that reaffirms the core
principles and purposes of the Alliance, to deter and defend its
security and values in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
direct threat to the security of Europe. In a direct rebuke to President
Vladimir Putin, NATO reiterated the Alliance's commitment to membership
for Ukraine. The Alliance has made clear that the threats it faces are
global and directly connected to the security of Europe, and that
China's stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge NATO's
interests, security, and values. NATO heads of state reaffirmed their
commitment to provide the necessary resources to implement their
decisions and to meet their commitments under the Defense Investment
Pledge for 2 percent of GDP.

NATO strategic concept scorecard grade

Distinctiveness

Is there a clear theme, concept, or label that distinguishes this
strategy from previous strategies?

The top-line message for the Strategic Concept is, "We are united." The
Strategic Concept is the clear articulation at a policy level of the
operational unity that the Alliance has demonstrated since the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, including reaffirming the Alliance's Bucharest
decision on membership for Ukraine.

The Strategy reaffirms strongly several points that NATO in recent years
has danced around, including the essential role of nuclear weapons to
the Alliance's security, now much more prominently featured in the text
and clearly, and directly articulated, and the Alliance's global
perspective on threats to its security. On China, for the first time in
a Strategic Concept, NATO includes a new, lengthy and detailed
discussion of the challenged posed by the PRC to the Alliance. As they
say, the Alliance works well in practice, but can it work in principle?
The Strategic Concept offers a resounding "yes."

Sound strategic context

Does the strategy accurately portray the current strategic context and
security environment facing NATO? Is the strategy predicated on any
specious assumptions?

The Strategic Concept does a good job of portraying the current, present
strategic context with robust and specific language on Russia and the
threat it poses to the Alliance. However, the cursory treatment of
terrorism in two stand-alone paragraphs belies the continued threat
posed by transnational terrorism to the Alliance, and certainly seems
odd after the Alliance's 20 years of focus on terrorism as one of its
primary concerns.

Defined goals

Does the strategy define clear goals?

Unfortunately, the Strategic Concept, like its predecessor documents, is
strong on top-line statements as to purpose and principles of the
Alliance, and much less detailed as to specific goals. This is not
particularly surprising for a heads-of-state-and-government document but
where the Alliance could have been more specific, in particular, on
defense investment, the Strategic Concept remains vague. The Strategic
Concept treats defense investment, aka defense spending, in the final
three paragraphs of a forty-nine paragraph document, and only obliquely
references the specific targets for Alliance defense spending of 2
percent of GDP and 20 percent of total budget on procurement, by mention
of the Defense Investment Pledge. Again, there is not mention of defense
investment in the preface to the document.

Clear lines of effort

Does the strategy outline several major lines of effort for achieving
its objectives? Will following those lines of effort attain the defined
goals? Does the strategy establish a clear set of priorities, or does it
present a laundry list of NATO activities?

Not surprisingly for a consensus document among thirty countries at the
head-of-state level, the Strategic Concept presents a laundry list of
NATO activities ranging from nuclear readiness to climate change and
attacks on cultural property. [Without **demeaning** the
**existential**]{.underline} global [threat of **climate
change**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the [importance of protecting our
shared]{.underline} cultural [heritage]{.underline}, [it seems that
NATO]{.underline}, in taking on these objectives, [is **stretching
itself**]{.underline} [well beyond]{.underline} [its]{.underline} core
[missions]{.underline} [of deter]{.underline} [and
**defend**]{.underline}, [crisis management]{.underline}, [and
**cooperative security**]{.underline} [and is not]{.underline}
particularly **[well equipped]{.underline}** [to do so.]{.underline}

Realistic implementation guidelines

Is it feasible to implement this strategy? Are there resources available
to sustain it?

[The]{.underline} Strategic [Concept does **not include
guidelines**]{.underline} [as such given the **high level**]{.underline}
[at]{.underline} [which it is]{.underline}, appropriately,
[pitched]{.underline}. [In terms of resources]{.underline},
[NATO]{.underline} [will have the resources to
**implement**]{.underline} [the strategy]{.underline} provided that all
of its members meet, quickly, the 2 percent and 20 percent targets
agreed to in the Defense Investment Pledge. [The **track
record**]{.underline} of most NATO members, [**unfortunately**, is **not
promising**]{.underline} in this regard. [Notably the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom [Prime
Minister]{.underline} [appears to have **rejected**]{.underline} [the
appeals of his]{.underline} Minister of Defense [for a **substantial
increase**]{.underline} [in spending]{.underline}, in part [to
**offset**]{.underline} the impact of [inflation]{.underline}. The
concern is that the UK's actions will provide cover for other states
that want to lag in their investments.

How Much Does the Strategic Concept Actually Matter?

**[Politically]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[Strat]{.underline}**egic **[Con]{.underline}**cept [and the unity it
represents are **very important**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
**[militarily]{.underline}** [and **operationally**]{.underline}, [it is
**less significant**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [2010]{.underline}
Strategic [Concept]{.underline} [had been **moribund** since at
least]{.underline} [2014]{.underline}, following Russia's annexation of
Crimea, [but of course NATO has **still been operating**]{.underline}
effectively since. [While a **lot of effort** has gone]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} building [**consensus** for Madrid]{.underline}, in
many ways [the **hard work starts now**]{.underline}. [There is a
**coherence** issue]{.underline}. The Strategic Concept, as NATO's
strategy, comes after the two main plans -- SACEUR's Concept for the
Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area and the future NATO
Warfighting Capstone Concept -- have already matured.

There was tacit acknowledgement at the Madrid summit that many
underlying operational plans would have to be revised. [**However**,
with NATO's strategy **transforming**]{.underline}, [mere **tweaks to
plans**]{.underline} [do not **seem sufficient**]{.underline}, and their
core assumptions should be revisited. For NATO's Warfighting Capstone
Concept -- how it fights in the future -- it is imperative that analysis
of Russia's military performance in Ukraine now becomes the backbone for
its development. Moreover, despite the collective might of NATO, it
cannot do everything, and the commitment at the 2015 Warsaw summit to a
'360-degree approach' to security -- both thematically and
geographically -- risks overstretch. In a hardening world, the Alliance
must take the opportunity to go back to its roots and seek support from
other actors, such as the EU. It is still expected that a NATO--EU joint
declaration will materialise before the end of the year.

### Inherency\-\--AT: StratCon\-\--1AR

#### Doesn't solve cohesion\-\--alt causes

Lindsay **Maizland, 6-30**-2022, \"NATO Countries Signal Resolve at
Summit: What Does It Mean for Russia?,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/nato-countries-signal-resolve-summit-what-does-it-mean-russia//DG

[The summit was an impressive show of resolve]{.underline} to counter
Russia's aggression, including through continued diplomatic, economic,
and military support for Ukraine. [NATO pledged to further expand its
military support]{.underline} for its vulnerable allies along the
Russian frontier. In particular, the United States announced that it
will establish a permanent headquarters for its V Corps in Poland. Most
important was the eleventh-hour agreement that Turkey reached with
Finland and Sweden, by which Ankara lifted its objections to their
joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the accession process.
[However, challenges remain]{.underline}.
**[Burden-sharing]{.underline}** is a perennial issue: Even after
Russia's assault on Ukraine, the [majority of members fall short of
their commitment]{.underline} to spend at least 2 percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP) on defense. The laggards include, most
importantly, Germany, although it has taken steps recently to meet that
target as a multiyear average. Moreover, in the weeks ahead, the
[alliance's resolve will be tested, as strains over rising inflation and
concerns over energy and food supply mount across the Euro-Atlantic
region]{.underline}. In recent weeks, France, Germany, and Italy have
expressed interest in finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict,
which would likely leave some seized Ukrainian territory in Russian
hands. That position is vehemently opposed by Poland and the Baltic
states, among others. Though those **[differences were pushed into the
background during this summit, they have not gone away.]{.underline}**

#### Doesn't solve deterrence\-\--intensifies hybrid threats

When [NATO is]{.underline} no longer willing to employ military power to
"escalate to de-escalate," it might be [failing as a military alliance.
It]{.underline} is reflected in the **[new strategic
concept]{.underline}** as it [steps away from its commitment to "stop
ongoing conflicts]{.underline} where they affect Alliance security";in
its [failure to act on Russian violations of international
law]{.underline} since 2008; in its [failure to respond to the Hybrid
War]{.underline} Russia has conducted against NATO and EU members since
2014; and not least, in its failure to respond resolutely to the ongoing
attempt to subjugate Ukraine through the use of both military and
non-military force. **[NATO fails to counter the Russian "fait accompli"
strategy]{.underline}**, using the threat of nuclear escalation as a
means to secure freedom to use military force as an integrated part of
its increasingly more aggressive foreign policy. [As a result, Russia is
openly threatening Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and
Norway]{.underline}. And the [Alliance takes another step
backward.]{.underline} Today, Lithuania and Kaliningrad. Tomorrow,
Norway and Svalbard. NATO has, however, recognized that the
Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace. That's a hugely important first step
towards acknowledging the Russian strategic messaging of being at war.

"I was present at the [NATO summit adopting the]{.underline} former
[strategic concept]{.underline} --- I was foreign minister --- and then
we had the aspiration of a partnership," Støre said. But citing "the
daily destruction, the extraordinary brutal use of military force" in
Ukraine, the Norwegian leader added, "In 2022, I think, you know, nobody
doubts the seriousness of the situation." Among the most crucial
decisions taken by leaders at the summit were plans to strengthen NATO's
so-called force posture, **[including with ambitious
plans]{.underline}** to be able to mobilize as many as 300,000 troops
within 30 days. There was some [confusion and disagreement about when
such a capability might be achieved]{.underline}, but the resolve among
allies to bolster their presence on the eastern flank was not in the
slightest doubt [The new model is about "more assured
availability"]{.underline} of forces from allies, said one senior NATO
official. "More readiness, more exercising, more preparation for the
locations that these forces might have to deploy to --- particularly in
defense of the alliance --- so that is the heart of what is new.
"**[It's a work in progress]{.underline}**," the senior official added.
"We will continue to work with allies over the next year or so to
identify the forces that can be attached to this model and to populate
the model. But we know the forces exist ... So this is an [exercise of

The potential for space-based conflict has never been more apparent.
Indeed some view it as inevitable, and in preparation states are
adopting policies and doctrine to guide military space activities.
Multinational security organizations like [NATO]{.underline} are
[beginning to follow]{.underline} this trend [as their adversaries act
on intent to weaponize space]{.underline}. Last year, NATO took steps
forward by launching a new space policy and recognizing space as an
operational domain. The [[policy]{.mark} itself [remains
**classified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[blunting]{.mark}** its [ability
to support NATO]{.mark} [security]{.mark} goals]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, the [core security [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} of the

[prevent]{.mark} **open [discourse]{.mark}** [about **allied

privately share an understanding of how to apply collective defense in
space]{.underline}, [a **classified internal [policy]{.mark}** [cannot

NATO has yet to concretely affirm the allliance's commitment to
collective defense in outer space.

That\'s where things like **[having transparency about your capabilities
and your policies]{.underline}** about your programs that can
[demonstrate good intent by sharing information about responsible
behavior]{.underline} are positive ways to look at it. Then, just in
terms of ways to move forward, the [idea behind the commitment not to
test ASAT missile tests]{.underline} is gathering some momentum because
it ties into a concern about not deliberating about crate debris on
orbit, which everyone agrees is not good because debris---as I said
before---can damage anyone whether or not you have a space caterpiece
program or not. There\'s the idea of like [no non-consensual close
approaches]{.underline}---the idea you don\'t get up close to another
country\'s satellite without their approval or their understanding
because that\'s a concern---as well as the idea of acting with due
regard for others. Some of these ideas are in the 1967 Outer Space
Treaty but does not mean that it\'s still helpful and applicable, so
there are **[ways forward in terms of sharing information and having
points of contact]{.underline}** for when there\'s possible conjunctions
or close approaches for your space capabilities. These are all good and
the last thing I\'ll say that\'s really changing is that---particularly
[for arms control capabilities]{.underline} that are
strategic---oftentimes they were seen as solely the prominence of
geopolitical superpowers. Yeah, this is a U**[.S.-Russia thing. Maybe,
it\'s the U.S.-Russia-China thing]{.underline}**. Okay, we\'re bringing
India in because they had an ASAT test but no one else. It\'s not really
important. So a lot of countries---the G77---they just didn\'t see
counter space capabilities as something that was relevant to them, but
that that [attitude is changing because there\'s a growing recognition
that every person on this planet is a user of space data]{.underline}
and so every person on this planet has an incentive to make sure that
space does not interfere with or it\'s not deliberately trashed and that
it\'s a stable predictable reliable domain. [Countries around the world
are starting to recognize this]{.underline} and starting to become more
involved in these discussions, so that\'s what I hope.

Communication

Effective [**[communication]{.underline}** [is
**foundational**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to deterrence]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [[**deterrer must communicate** that they
are]{.underline}]{.mark} both **[[capable of
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if attacked]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.underline}
[this]{.underline}]{.mark} response [[is]{.mark} a **[credible]{.mark}
threat**]{.underline} [to an adversary]{.underline}. NATO has a couple
of clear foundational articles addressed to this. The most prominent, of
course, is Article 5 which underpins collective defense and outlines
that an armed attack on one NATO member state is considered an equal
attack on all NATO member states. [[At the]{.mark} June
2021]{.underline} **[NATO [Summit]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the [Alliance
**acknowledged** that they **included attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[from]{.underline}, [within]{.underline}, [or to space [in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rticle
**[[5]{.underline}]{.mark}** [declaration]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [**[without clear declaration]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[public]{.mark} **discussion**]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} [the **[thresholds]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
considerations [of]{.underline} specific [attacks]{.underline} in or
from space, [[it will allow for a **gray**]{.mark} **operating
[zone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [Russia has already **taken
advantage** of these]{.underline} **[undefined thresholds]{.underline}**
[by locally]{.underline} [jamming]{.underline} GPS [signals]{.underline}
[during a major]{.underline} NATO military [exercise]{.underline}. While
this was a reversible effect, and did not physically harm the satellites
themselves, it certainly denied the Alliance's access to space.
[**[Communicating]{.underline}** [what is]{.underline}]{.mark}
considered [[an **armed attack**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against space
systems [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[paramount]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[to establishing]{.underline} [an **effective deterrence**
strategy]{.underline}. It is also foundational to pursuing strategies
for operation and response in the case of a conflict that extends into
or involves the space domain.

[NATO **[A]{.mark}**]{.underline}rticle **[[6]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also [presents a **challenge**]{.underline} [for defining]{.underline}
and responding to [attacks on **space forces**]{.underline}. As stated,
an armed attack includes those "...on the forces, vessels, or aircraft
of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other
area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were
stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the
Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of
Cancer."37 Satellites present a unique challenge to this statement.
While they might be considered a force or vessel, satellites in GEO are
in orbit over the equator, even if the ground stations they communicate
with are in the northern hemisphere. Additionally, satellites in LEO,
depending on their orbit and inclination, will always pass over areas
not defined above. Would this then indicate that an attack on a
satellite does not violate the treaty, so long as it is not orbiting
north of the Tropic of Cancer at the moment of the attack? These
[geographic [boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly [**[do not
apply]{.underline}** [to space]{.underline}]{.mark} assets, [yet space
assets]{.underline} [are the **foundation** of many]{.underline} modern
military [capabilities]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} **discrepancy**

Space Defenses

A clear way to bolster deterrence by denial is to ensure that attacks on
Alliance members' space systems are difficult to achieve. There are
several methods of defending satellites against attack, and not all
defenses are useful against every type of attack. Therefore, a varied
strategy of passive and active defenses is necessary to ensure the
protection of satellites and continued use in a denied environment.

Passive Defenses.

Passive defenses loosely fall into three categories: architectural,
technical, and operational.38 Architectural defenses rely on the design
of the satellite constellation itself to ensure that the mission and
capability can withstand attack or degrade gracefully. A few examples of
this are:

1\. Disaggregation is the separation of capabilities from one platform
to several. For example, the US currently operates communication
satellites that have both tactical and strategic---i.e.,
nuclear---signals. Disaggregation would separate these missions to
preserve strategic communications in the event of an attack on tactical
communications.

2\. Distribution is when multiple satellites are responsible for
providing a capability to the operator. The combined data from several
satellites ensures that an adversary would have to target all of these
satellites to fully deny the capability.

3\. Proliferation indicates that a large number of the same satellites
are performing the same mission. This increases the overall capacity and
size of the constellation and acts as almost a swarm of satellites
operating in sync but not reliant on one another to provide capability
to the operator.

Technical defenses are those that change the hardware or software of a
satellite to protect it against attack. Some of these are commonplace in
many operating military satellites today. Examples include:

1\. Shielding is a key technical defense that protects vulnerable
systems from high levels of radiation. Shielding is already, to some
degree, used for some military satellites to protect against the
radiated space environment and nuclear effects in space. Increased
shielding could protect more satellites against electromagnetic pulses
or high-powered microwave weapons.

2\. Filtering and shuttering protect sensors on remote sensing
satellites from laser dazzling or blinding. Like a filter or shutter on
a camera, this technical defense allows only light of a certain
wavelength or level of intensity to reach the sensor.

3\. Jam-resistant waveforms protect against jamming by encoding the data
transmitted on a radio wave to the satellite or back to Earth. Different
tactics such as frequency hopping or interleaving may further protect
satellites from electronic counter-space weapons.

Finally, operational defenses are those that rely on the operation of
the satellite itself. Operational defenses include:

1\. Maneuvering a satellite may move it out of harm's way of an incoming
attack. However, maneuvering often takes time and would expend fuel,
which shortens a satellite's operational lifetime.

2\. Reconstitution allows nations to quickly replace existing space
capabilities by launching more satellites or bringing additional ground
stations online.

3\. Rapid deployment calls for the quick launch of space capabilities
when needed. The pace of launch would likely require extra satellites to
be on hand and in storage, and a launch vehicle to be quickly procured
and available.

Passive defenses, like those described above, present the best possible
option for NATO deterrence by denial and interoperability across
different Alliance member capabilities because of the opportunity for
technology and standards sharing, as well as the team-centric nature of
resiliency for space missions. Sharing technology and standards across
space systems, to include best practices, allows nations with disparate
space systems and architectures to ensure that a common standard of
protection or defense is assured across the mission-set. Countries that
have strong cybersecurity for military missions, to include space
systems, lead in establishing NATO strategies for strong space
cybersecurity. Likewise, Alliance members with redundant mission
capability should take the lead on developing best practices for
integration and interoperability to ensure a resilient capability in the
case of denial of space services.

Active Defenses.

Active defenses are those that target the threat itself, either after
the attack has begun or proactive efforts if an attack is deemed
imminent. For space systems, this means targeting the counter-space
weapon itself, even if it is another satellite. Active defenses against
counter-space attacks can either be space- or ground-based.39
Space-based active defenses often include capabilities onboard
satellites that will target, degrade, destroy, or distract the attacking
weapon. Space-based active defenses could also include separate
satellites that host these capabilities, which are deployed to guard a
high-value space asset. These 'bodyguard' satellites, equipped with
onboard active defense systems, have been proposed recently by France.40
Some options for onboard active defenses systems, either on the
satellite itself or on defensive bodyguard satellites include: jamming
and spoofing, dazzling or blinding lasers, kinetic shoot-back systems,
or even the capability to physically seize the counter-space weapon.
Ground-based defenses are systems based on Earth that could target
counter-space systems and supporting infrastructure. These include
cyberattacks on the command-and-control battle management system,
jamming or spoofing, a direct-ascent ASAT, or other kinetic attacks on
space or ground infrastructure.

The biggest political challenge with active space defenses is that while
the user or defender may view them as defensive measures, some of them
could also be used offensively as counter-space weapons. Therefore,
nations must seriously weigh the political ramifications of investing in
active defenses. For NATO, this means a collective conversation and
decision about how to address the growing weaponization of the space
domain, and whether the Alliance views active defense measures as
deepening weaponization or as valued defenses in an increasingly
unstable domain.

Space Situational Awareness.

Investing in better knowledge and understanding of the space domain
would make a critical impact in decision-making and allow for a better
defense of space capabilities. It is difficult to diagnose a disabled or
non-responsive satellite. On-orbit servicing satellites (or satellites
designed to repair or upgrade other satellites in space) are not yet
widely used or available, therefore SSA is critical to determining if a
satellite was impaired by an attack or an environmental phenomenon like
space weather or debris. It is incredibly difficult to accurately
characterize and track all satellites in orbit, but without such
capability, political leaders are unable to make confident decisions
regarding space systems and defenses. Investing in robust optical,
infrared, and radar SSA systems requires a network ground-based and
space-based systems. For ground systems, regionally based alliances are
less effective. For a full view of near-earth space, SSA systems need
several radars around the world in each hemisphere. The credibility and
effectiveness of deterrence in space is reliant on SSA and the
information and ability to make informed characterizations of incidents.

NATO posture to promote deterrence is incredibly regionally based to the
European continent. However, in order to track, detect, and characterize
all objects in orbit, NATO needs ground station terminals across the
globe, not solely in the European theatre. Despite Luxembourg's recent
agreement to develop a NATO SSA center, cooperating with allies and
partners outside of NATO will be critical to ensure a full view of
near-Earth orbits.

Interoperability and Partnerships

[Key to any **multinational alliance**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
especially [NATO]{.underline}, [**interoperability** of space
forces]{.underline} and data **[must be addressed]{.underline}**.
[[Space has]{.underline}]{.mark} traditionally [[been]{.underline}
[one]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of the most]{.underline} **[classified
domains]{.underline}**]{.mark}, likely due to its origins supporting
nuclear arsenals and the intelligence community during the Cold War.
[[This]{.underline} [has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greatly
[impacted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[the]{.mark} [**sharing** of]{.mark}
space]{.underline}-[based]{.underline}
**[[intel]{.underline}]{.mark}**ligence [and data amongst
nations]{.underline}, [[especially **from the US**]{.underline}]{.mark}
to other Allies and partners. [These]{.underline} [[barriers must be
**reclassified**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **lowered**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[build a]{.mark} more
**[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} and interoperable
[force]{.underline}. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [forces
from]{.underline} [all]{.underline} member [[states **must train**
with]{.underline} [access to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[space
[assets]{.mark} and data]{.underline}**, as well as train for a
space-denied environment.

Since NATO no longer operates its own satellites, interoperability among
national space assets must also be addressed. [[NATO must **clearly
delineate** what assets]{.underline} [are available]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and **usable**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} NATO
[purposes]{.underline} [[during **peacetime**]{.underline}]{.mark} or
wartime. Looking forward, NATO members must
[[consider]{.underline}]{.mark} [how to **reduce
[redundancy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [ensure
**[resiliency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and build]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**[cohesive set]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} space
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} [that will]{.underline} enable the
warfighter and **[reassure collective defense]{.underline}**. [[An
**assessment of threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline} NATO
[space missions]{.underline} and the mosaic of defenses [that [could be
**employed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to assure
**capability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [should be **thoroughly
assessed**]{.underline} [in order [to determine]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[cross]{.mark}-Alliance]{.underline} space
[[defenses]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This will require **close
collaboration**]{.underline} and communication [about Alliance space
systems]{.underline} **[capabilities]{.underline}** and defenses. Clear
expectations and honesty about vulnerabilities of certain space systems
would allow NATO members to collaborate to create complimentary or
resilient space architectures to other NATO allies.

#### Those don't solve [capability gaps]{.underline} for Russia and China to [exploit]{.underline}\-\--effectively [opening]{.underline} grey zones for China and Russia to test NATO [resolve]{.underline}. Only the plan [creates]{.underline} united NATO [capabilities]{.underline} to [deter]{.underline} adversaries.

Strategic Ambiguity: How Much is too Much?

[Overall]{.underline}, [the [Brussels]{.mark} Communiqué]{.underline}
[[send]{.mark}s a **[strong signal]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} [are
**[prepared to defend]{.mark}** their interests]{.underline} in space,
[including [through]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** [if necessary]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [the **[clarity]{.mark}** of this
message]{.underline} [[is **diluted**]{.underline}
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[surrounding]{.mark} the **exact [conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[prompt]{.mark} the [Allies]{.mark} to
**invoke**]{.underline} [**A**rticle **5**]{.underline} in response to
an armed attack. [This **[ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [may
be]{.underline} seen as [an **asset**]{.underline}:
[leaving]{.underline} hostile [powers **guessing** the exact
conditions]{.underline} [that could **trigger a forceful military
response**]{.underline} [by the Alliance]{.underline} [may
prompt]{.underline} those [powers]{.underline} [to
**proceed**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} greater
**[caution]{.underline}**.25

Strategic ambiguity thus has its benefits. [However]{.underline},
**[hostile]{.underline}** [actors]{.underline} may [also [read it as a
**lack of resolve**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the present case, at least
two factors may encourage such a reading. The first relates to the
[[uncertain **parameters**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline} the
[right of self-defense]{.underline} [itself]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**ambiguities** that surround]{.mark}
its application]{.underline} [in space]{.underline}.26 For example,
[could]{.underline} **[[non-kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[interference]{.underline}]{.mark} against space-based assets or
services, such as signal jamming, [rise to the level of an
armed]{.underline} [attack]{.underline}? If so, under what circumstances
does such interference satisfy the gravity threshold required to
constitute an armed attack?27 Is it lawful to declare a space exclusion
zone or to deploy "bodyguard" satellites to defend critical space-based
assets in anticipation of an attack in the exercise of the right of
self-defense? Having recognized the applicability of Article 5 to space
attacks, [NATO nations]{.underline} [need to develop a **shared
approach**]{.underline} [to these and]{.underline} [related
questions]{.underline} [in order to demonstrate]{.underline} **[unity
and resolve]{.underline}**.

The second factor relates to the geographical limits that Article 6 of
the NAT imposes on the operation of Article 5 of the NAT. The first
sub-paragraph of Article 6 deals with attacks on Allied territory. It is
clear from the language of this sub-paragraph that armed attacks
launched into the territory or islands of NATO members from or through
space fall squarely within the ambit of Article 5. Armed attacks
launched against their assets in space are caught by the second
sub-paragraph of Article 6, which deals with attacks against the
"forces, vessels or aircraft of any of the Parties." While neither the
notion of a vessel,28 nor that of an aircraft, 29 extends to objects
primarily designed for operation in outer space, the concept of 'forces'
is broad enough to cover spacecraft and their personnel. There is a
catch, however. [The second **sub-paragraph**]{.underline} [of Article
6]{.underline} of the NAT [refers to attacks]{.underline} [taking place
**"in or over"**]{.underline} [Allied territories]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} [means that]{.underline}, at best,
[attacks]{.underline} [against **Allied forces**]{.underline} in space
[are covered by Article 5]{.underline} [only]{.underline} [whilst in
orbit "**over**"]{.underline} such [territories]{.underline} and above
their airspace. Accordingly, the destruction of an Allied satellite may
engage Article 5 if the satellite was orbiting over the territory of a
NATO nation, but not if it was orbiting over the South China Sea, for
instance.30

[NATO [nations]{.mark}]{.underline} thus **[[face a
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} geographical
[[**limitations** imposed by]{.mark} **[A]{.mark}**rticle]{.underline}
**[[6]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the NAT [on the operation]{.underline}
[of their]{.underline} mutual **[assistance commitment]{.underline}**
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of their space
assets]{.underline} [[to **hostile maneuvers**]{.underline}
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [potential]{.underline}
[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in the Southern
Hemisphere where the Alliance has the fewest Space Surveillance Network
(SSN) assets. [To address this **vulnerability**]{.underline}, the
[Allies]{.underline} [may]{.underline} consider Article 5 to be
applicable to attacks against their space assets wherever they may
operate, that is without any geographical restrictions. However,
**[[extend]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing the [scope of **[A]{.mark}**rticle
**[5]{.mark}** to cover all]{.underline} [around Earth]{.underline} [may
**[expose]{.mark}**]{.underline} [NATO to
**[accusations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that it **seeks to
militarize**]{.underline}]{.mark} this domain. Also, [such a move would
**[lack credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[unless]{.mark} it is
**[underwritten by capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[necessary]{.underline} [to defend]{.underline} Western [space
assets]{.underline} and the services they provide.

**[[Ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** the matter [is **[not an
option]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
are [known for **[exploit]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} [legal]{.underline}
[**["grey zone"]{.underline}** [situations]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
conducting]{.underline} **[hostile]{.underline}**
[operations]{.underline} [below]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
traditional [**threshold** of physical violence]{.underline}
[amounting]{.underline} [to an armed attack]{.underline}.31 They are
**[[likely to test]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
legal **[readiness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} political
[[resolve]{.mark} in the space]{.underline} [domain]{.underline}, for
example, [[by using **blind spots**]{.mark} to undertake]{.underline}
[**nefarious** activities]{.underline} [such]{.underline} as co-orbital
**[jamming]{.underline}** or RPOs. [Strategic
[ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline} on the geographical scope of application
of Article 5 is [[likely to **invite, rather than
deter**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such [**hostile**
[probing]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In a recent speech, [Secretary]{.underline} of the Air Force Frank
Kendall [highlighted **missile warning**]{.underline} [and
tracking]{.underline} [as "a **no-fail**]{.underline} space
[mission]{.underline}." He is exactly right.

For decades, adversary nations have observed US military advantages,
specifically the unique ability to execute robust long-range strikes.
These operations hold key targets at risk --- command centers,
production facilities, logistics lines, supply depots and more. Destroy
the right combination of these and an opposing military force will have
a hard time staying in the fight.

[That is why **adversary nations**]{.underline} [have **doubled
down**]{.underline} [on developing]{.underline} [their]{.underline} own
[long range **strike options**]{.underline} [through a range of
**missile technologies**]{.underline}. [They want to hold]{.underline}
US [homeland targets]{.underline} [and]{.underline} our [forward
**operating bases**]{.underline} [at risk]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, consequently, [this threat must be
**blunted**]{.underline}.

[Key to **defeating**]{.underline} a [long-range strike]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} our [adversaries is having]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [means to **detect, track**]{.underline} [and
**counter** a range of new]{.underline} and **[virulent
delivery]{.underline}** [systems]{.underline}. This requires a
modernized warning and tracking enterprise comprised of a multi-layered
space-based architecture of sensors across all orbital regimes. As
Congress debates next year's defense budget, lawmakers must fund,
support and provide attentive oversight for this ambitious but critical
piece of national defense architecture in space.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
**not beginning from scratch**]{.underline}. [Missile
warning]{.underline} [and]{.underline} tracking [systems **existed**

are essential today]{.underline} [for detecting]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-armed [ballistic missile]{.underline}
launche[s]{.underline}. Capabilities like Space Based Infrared System
(SBIRS), paired with ground radars, are optimized for this task. [The
**satellites**]{.underline}, [which are in]{.underline}
**[h]{.underline}**igh g**[eo]{.underline}**synchronous orbits, [provide
a **broad view**]{.underline} [of the globe]{.underline} and can [detect
the **heat signature**]{.underline} [of a missile's]{.underline} rocket
**[plume]{.underline}**. The ground radars can then track the inbound
threat.

[However]{.underline}, [our adversaries]{.underline} **[understand the
limitations]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} current
[system]{.underline}, [motivating them to **invest**]{.underline} [in a
new generation]{.underline} [of **hypersonic weapons**]{.underline} [and
other **maneuvering**]{.underline}, non-ballistic [missiles]{.underline}
[that take **advantage of blind spots**]{.underline} in our current
warning and tracking enterprise. These new systems have smaller heat
signatures to detect from space, and they fly less predictable tracks.
[This requires the US to respond]{.underline} [with a **multi-orbit
sensor**]{.underline} [architecture]{.underline} [that can
detect]{.underline} and track [these new threats]{.underline} in new
ways, [while still keeping]{.underline} [an **eagle's eye out** for

Importantly, [the **next generation** of missile]{.underline}
[warning]{.underline} and tracking [capability must be
**resilient**]{.underline} and not easily targetable by an adversary.
Due to actions by China and Russia, space is no longer a peaceful
sanctuary for defensive military applications. [Both nations

Introduction

It has taken some time for the security implications of climate change
to find their way on to the NATO agenda. This can be explained by the
many security challenges that the alliance has faced in the 21st
century---a more assertive Russia in NATO's eastern neighborhood, the
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the threat of cyberattacks and hybrid
warfare campaigns, and now the implacable rise of China as a global
military and technological power. At the same time, for a security
community used to reacting to---not anticipating---crises and to dealing
with concrete and imminent challenges, climate change may well have
seemed difficult to assess. It would have a future, not present, impact
and affect areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle
East and Central Asia, where the alliance was little engaged. In the
international arena, the focus was on mitigation, trying to
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, rather than on
adaptation, making our societies more resilient to cope with the shocks
that climate-change-driven events would more frequently engender. Once
the dimensions of climate change as a security challenge became clearer,
policymakers would have time to adjust their strategies and
capabilities.

Yet the past few years have underscored that the future is now. There is
no more luxury of time to respond to this challenge. The planet is
sending repeated warnings that climate change has reached a tipping
point and poses a constant threat to the functionality of economies and
societies. This will make larger areas of the globe uninhabitable, as
living with 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) or hotter
becomes the norm rather than the exception. The past three summers have
been the hottest on record; the past five years have seen the largest
numbers of category 4 and 5 hurricanes. Devastating forest fires have
displaced people from the west coast of the United States, western
Canada, Siberia, Greece, Portugal, and Australia. Colorado recently
experienced such a fire in the middle of the winter. In January,
meteorologists recorded the most extreme temperature vortex ever, with
minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic and
plus 50 degrees Celsius (plus 122 degrees Fahrenheit) in Australia. We
have become used to heavier rainfalls and more widespread flooding.
Rising sea levels have placed entire cities and even countries in
jeopardy, as we heard in the powerful words from Bermuda's prime
minister, representing the small island states, at 2021 United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow last November. Indeed, 50
percent of Asia's population today lives in coastal cities. The
biodiversity that has regulated the smooth functioning of our natural
habitat for thousands of years is being rapidly depleted. Prolonged
droughts affect freshwater availability and put acute stresses on food
production and rural livelihoods, leading the United Nations to forecast
that by mid-century, 40 percent of the globe's land surface will be
subject to acute water stress. We will need to contend with more climate
refugees than those today on the move because of conflicts or poverty
(currently an all-time high of 26 million).

Climate change is arguably the first truly global security challenge in
that, according to UN reports, only 11 out of the current 193 UN member
states do not currently experience its impact in one form or another.

Only belatedly have we become aware of the role that droughts play in
exacerbating social and political tensions in places such as Syria,
Darfur, and Afghanistan. Of course, not every natural disaster can be
laid at the door of climate change, as earthquakes in Haiti or the
recent eruption of an undersea volcano near Tonga attest. Moreover, the
planet's climate has rarely been stable, and historians have documented
extreme cold spells in the 17th century or devastating droughts in
biblical times. It was, after all, the catastrophic Lisbon earthquake in
1757 that for Voltaire ended the 18th century's age of optimism. Yet the
mountain of scientific evidence produced by the UN's Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change points to the role of global warming as a force
multiplier for more frequent and extreme weather events, giving the
planet less time to recover from one natural disaster before the next
one strikes, thereby producing a cumulative destructive effect. Climate
change is arguably the first truly global security challenge in that,
according to UN reports, only 11 out of the current 193 UN member states
do not currently experience its impact in one form or another. Any
organization, like NATO, that tries to address climate change thus faces
the dual challenge of responding to individual flash points (such as
extreme weather events putting lives at risk or leading to social
breakdown), while simultaneously understanding how climate change is
shaping the future of global geopolitics, making future conflicts over
land, water, or resources more likely in the longer term. Getting these
predictive models right is essential if the allies are to devise the
preventive strategies to head off the worst-case scenarios while
mitigating the worst consequences. Thus, it was no surprise that US
President Joe Biden's administration ordered a National Intelligence
Estimate of the security implications of climate change as one of its
first acts upon taking office.

The first time the NATO Response Force (NRF) deployed was to Kashmir in
2006 to help Pakistan restore infrastructure and communications after a
major earthquake.

The military forces of NATO countries have played an increasing role in
responding to extreme weather events in recent years. In fact, the first
time the NATO Response Force (NRF) deployed was to Kashmir in 2006 to
help Pakistan restore infrastructure and communications after a major
earthquake. In recent years, alliance military forces have been
increasingly pulled into civil defense tasks. British, French, and Dutch
marines and engineers have gone to the Caribbean to restore order in the
wake of hurricanes that have paralyzed the normal process of government.
Military firefighters and aircraft have been mobilized to combat forest
fires in the United States, Canada, and Europe. British and German
forces have been called up to build flood defenses, evacuate flood
victims, and build pontoon bridges or reconnect power lines. Military
hospitals and medical personnel have helped local authorities cope with
extreme heatwaves affecting the elderly and other populations at risk.
The military with their rapid-response capabilities have become the
partner of choice to the civil emergency authorities within NATO
countries in responding to climate-driven events. This has also been the
case with other shocks that may well be linked indirectly to climate
change, such as the coronavirus pandemic, which result from stresses on
the natural environment and the interface between animals and humans.
The pace of military deployments within alliance member states has
reached such an extent that some NATO commanders are worried that this
could have deleterious consequences for training and the retention of
war-fighting skills.

In the process of deploying to climate-stressed zones, characterized by
extreme weather events or hotter or colder conditions, NATO's military
forces have become aware of how climate change impacts their own ability
to operate. For instance, the Pentagon has assessed that two-thirds of
US military bases, especially along coastlines, are vulnerable to rising
sea levels or extreme weather events. Hampton Roads in Virginia, which
is important to NATO as the home of Joint Forces Command Atlantic and
the US Second Fleet, has been assessed as especially vulnerable. Hotter
temperatures, greater frequency of high winds, storm surges, or
increased salinity in the oceans have led NATO military commanders to
review both the resilience of their equipment (for instance, the
performance of ship turbines) or the dependency of military operations
on fossil fuels. In Afghanistan, for instance, helicopters and vehicles
needed more than average maintenance because of dust storms and
persistent high temperatures, while the high consumption of gasoline
required lengthy and dangerous supply lines from Pakistan into
Afghanistan that jihadists targeted. At one stage, NATO planners
calculated that a \$2 gallon of gasoline cost over \$100 by the time it
reached a NATO ISAF unit in Helmand or Kunduz.11Amory Lovins, "DOD's
Energy Challenge as Strategic Opportunity," Joint Forces Quarterly,
Issue 57, second quarter, 2010. This certainly motivated the allies to
experiment with smart energy camps, powered by solar and wind
generators, which were demonstrated at NATO trials such as the annual
Capable Logistician exercise. The Pentagon, with an annual fuel bill
surpassing \$ 25 billion, has been graded as the 43rd "country" in the
world in terms of fossil fuel emissions.22Neta Crawford, Pentagon Fuel
Use; Climate Change and the Costs of War, Boston University paper, June
2019. Accordingly, NATO military forces have faced the twin task of
fine-tuning their modus operandi and added value in supporting the
humanitarian response to climate change, while adapting their own
doctrine, training, and capabilities to operate in these more demanding
conditions.

NATO planners calculated that a \$2 gallon of gasoline cost over \$100
by the time it reached a NATO ISAF unit in Helmand or Kunduz.

NATO's purpose has always been to defend its populations against
challenges that evolve into concrete security threats and that require
military forces or military organizations. The criterion has been the
added value that the alliance can bring to bear. Sometimes this means
that NATO is in the lead and generates the bulk of the response from
within its own ranks and capabilities. This is obviously the case with
territorial collective defense, particularly as it applies to Russia's
military buildup on NATO's eastern borders at the present time. In other
cases, the alliance functions in a supporting role, integrating its
capabilities with those of other institutions and actors as part of a
networked, comprehensive approach. What NATO brings to the table here
are its analytical and intelligence cells, its strategic planning and
foresight capabilities, its political consultation, joint assessment and
information-sharing structures, its web of partnerships with non-member
states and other international organizations, and its political-military
command and control and operations network from HQ to the regional
level. Few other organizations have all this machinery under one single
roof. Consequently, as the climate change community has gradually
accepted a role for the military in addressing climate change---after
initially fearing that this would put too much emphasis on adaptation at
the expense of the primary political goal of reducing carbon
emissions---pressure has built on NATO to use its spectrum of
capabilities in a more coherent, systematic way. The mounting urgency
and universality of global warming require every institution to step up
and play its part within its means and capabilities. The broad spectrum
of NATO assets means that it can contribute in multiple supporting ways
to a UN-led effort both to reduce global warning and adapt to the
climate impacts that are already locked in, even if that warming can be
limited to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. The
question now is how to optimize all these NATO assets so that the
alliance can receive and transmit expertise and make its contribution
count.

NATO Secretary General and former UN climate envoy Jens Stoltenberg has
usefully led the way. At the Brussels summit in June 2021, he declared
that climate is not just a trans-boundary ecological crisis but a
security crisis as well. Stoltenberg skillfully used his NATO 2030
reflection exercise and the review carried out by the group of experts
he appointed to generate public pressure and build the case (against
initial skepticism from some allies) for a formal NATO role in
addressing climate change. Before the summit, NATO foreign ministers
endorsed a joint analysis of the security implications of climate
change. One paper recognized climate change not only as a threat to
human security per se, but also as a force multiplier which could
accelerate and intensify preexisting tensions and conflicts, many of
which, because of their location close to NATO's borders, could impinge
directly on the security of the alliance.33Neta C. Crawford, Pentagon
Fuel Use, Climate Change, and the Costs of War, Brown University, 2019.
At the Brussels summit, the allies adopted a Climate Change and Security
Action Plan broken down into four broad implementation categories. These
are awareness, mitigation, adaptation, and partnerships.

Awareness

In the first area, awareness, NATO possesses a range of sensing and
mapping instruments that can collect data on climate trends and
correlate and fuse this data into a composite picture. NATO navies,
especially the United States', have sophisticated oceanographic and
meteorological tracking sensors that can plot changes in the jet stream
or in the melting of the Arctic polar ice. The NATO Centre for Maritime
Research and Experimentation at La Spezia, Italy, has been doing this
work in the Mediterranean and Atlantic for many years and has its own
research vessel, the Alliance. As NATO develops more capability in space
using a mix of national military and commercial satellites, it will also
be better able to track ocean warming and land phenomena such as
desertification. The EU's new generation of Copernicus satellites are
already able to do this. This data collection and fusion will not enable
NATO to predict outbreaks of popular protest or specific migration flows
from arid rural communities, but by tracking climate-stressed areas, it
can indicate likely pressure points and feed into an international watch
list or early-warning system. The question is how and where will the
alliance plug in its strategic forecasting and modeling: directly into
the UN (UN Environment Programme, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change), into the EU or the NGO climate change community, or back to
allied governments to use as they see fit? Canada has offered to host a
NATO Climate and Security Centre of Excellence to foster the exchange of
information and expertise among allies and partners. One of its first
tasks could be to set up a remote data-sensing network where forecasting
and modeling could be centralized and made immediately accessible to the
global climate community of interest (UN and agencies, international
bodies, governments, and NGOs) on a pooling basis. This could extend to
complementarity in the sharing of satellite observation data based on
common links and protocols. An exchange between NATO and EU satellite
data would be a good place to start. Another task is to see how data can
be used within NATO to support evidence-based decision-making.

Mitigation

In the area of mitigation, the alliance is targeting the reduction of
its own CO2 emissions from its military equipment and operations. Here
it is under pressure from the NGO community to set the same targets for
emissions reductions that allied countries have agreed to in their
Nationally Defined Contributions to the COP 26; that is to say, around
50 percent by 2030 and net zero by mid-century. Given the priority of
collective defense in NATO at the moment and the need for
fossil-fuel-guzzling fighter aircraft and tanks, meeting this target may
prove impossible. Collective defense also necessitates large-scale
military field exercises rather than the table-top simulations that were
used in times of lesser tension.

NATO could consider setting up a Green Fund to help finance trials and
demonstrations and to help the less advanced allies make the transition
to green energy.

Yet NATO forces can go green in many other areas, such as transporting
supplies by rail and waterways rather than road. Battery-operated
vehicles and electric-powered robots will certainly play a larger role
in logistics and rear operations. Drones will reduce the numbers of
aircraft and ships that the alliance needs to maintain and deploy. 3D
manufacturing will also allow for cheaper and more energy-efficient
production of many of the weapons systems and components that NATO
armies use, and the smart energy camps already referred to can
significantly reduce the operating costs of the large number of
headquarters and bases in the NATO command structure. NATO is a natural
venue for allies and partners to organize trials and experimentation,
exchange best practices and experience, and use NATO's system of
certification and STANAGs (standardization agreements) to set common
standards and promote interoperability for green energy equipment.
Currently the alliance is working on a common methodology for measuring
military CO2 emissions. It will be important for this to be rigorous, as
it will be scrutinized carefully by the NGO community, who no doubt will
be pushing, too, for NATO to show transparency and accountability in
publishing the results annually. The willingness and ability of the
allies to input reliable data in a common timeframe will be crucial to
the credibility of the process. Ideally these climate-related inputs
should be part of NATO's defense planning process and setting of
capability targets, which would help ensure that they receive high-level
attention in capitals. In view of Secretary General Stoltenberg's push
for more common funding, NATO could consider setting up a Green Fund to
help finance trials and demonstrations and to help the less advanced
allies make the transition to green energy.

Adaptation

The next line of effort concerns adaptation. This is helping other
countries to adapt to the challenges of climate change as well as using
NATO's military forces to respond to the extreme weather events and
natural disasters that were described earlier. This area is more
tentative and even problematic for the alliance. In the first place, it
depends on how active NATO will be "out of area," and in conducting
nation building, stabilization, and training missions beyond its borders
now that its mission in Afghanistan is over. Although Stoltenberg has
pushed the training of local forces as a future role for the alliance,
and as a cheaper alternative to risky interventions, the current primacy
of collective defense within the alliance will limit the appetite to
take on new operations. Certainly, NATO is continuing its training
mission in Iraq and is using regional training centers in Jordan,
Kuwait, and even Mauritania. It has signed a technical cooperation
agreement with the African Union and has a liaison office in Addis
Ababa---the structures are there to work on climate change resilience
issues if the will and resources are there on both sides. Yet it is the
European Union that is launching new missions at the moment, with EU
training missions in Mali, Burkina Faso, and most recently Mozambique.
The local partners are mainly interested in military assistance to fight
jihadists and anti-government militias. So it is not certain that they
will want to divert scarce resources to climate change resilience, even
if NATO has good products to offer. When it comes to emergency relief,
NATO forces, particularly the rapid reaction units, have the capacity to
provide immediate assistance, for instance in the distribution of relief
supplies or the repair of telecommunications infrastructure. Yet, at a
time of constant tension with Russia, the North Atlantic Council will be
reluctant to allow these precious spearhead forces to depart to the
other end of the globe, no matter how noble the cause.

Yet, at a time of constant tension with Russia, the North Atlantic
Council will be reluctant to allow these precious spearhead forces to
depart to the other end of the globe, no matter how noble the cause.

Allies may also be unwilling to contribute forces to NATO humanitarian
missions if there are no common funding arrangements and they have to
pick up all the costs themselves for contingencies that they could not
have foreseen. This cost-sharing debate cast a long shadow over the
deployment of the Response Forces (NRF)to Kashmir in 2006. (The fact
that Poland, Spain, and Italy happened to have been the main NRF
contributors at the time of the earthquake meant that they bore most of
the costs of what was supposed to be a joint NATO operation.) Moreover,
allies tend to use their own national forces to deal with natural
disasters at home, such as floods, storms, and bush fires. Yet there are
exceptions, such as the assistance that Turkey and Greece have sent to
each other in the aftermath of earthquakes or the water-spraying
aircraft that some allies sent to Greece to douse forest fires last
summer. Covid-19 has also brought some useful cross-border cooperation
among Europe's militaries, as in patient transfers. If we link migration
to climate change (as we will undoubtedly do more in the future), then
NATO can claim a useful supporting role to the EU in working with its
border agency, FRONTEX, in monitoring migration across the Aegean Sea
and in providing intelligence and tanker capacity to the EU's Sophia
maritime mission off the coast of Libya.

There are plenty of other institutions and options besides NATO in this
area. Hence, the alliance will need to ponder carefully on where its
niche roles and added value reside.

Yet this point only underscores that the EU has most of the same
military assets as NATO for emergency relief and far more civilian
resources as well. Its Crisis Management Centre can do the same
clearinghouse job, matching demand with supply, as the alliance's
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Relief Coordination Centre. The latter is often
activated during crises but not much used, although in all fairness it
was somewhat more active in organizing the transport of medical supplies
and protective clothing between allies during the Covid-19 pandemic. The
EU's humanitarian aid office, ECHO, is also more closely tied to the
UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) than the
NATO structures. This is not to argue that NATO has no role in
Adaptation. Individual circumstances will always matter. But there are
plenty of other institutions and options besides NATO in this area.
Hence, the alliance will need to ponder carefully on where its niche
roles and added value reside. A dialogue with the EU, UN, and regional
organizations might at least be useful to share experiences and lessons
learned.

partners known as the Five Eyes --- the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia
and New Zealand --- "with the aim of strengthening deterrence (and)
improving the resilience of space systems on which Five-Eyes militaries
rely."

Yet it also called for Canada to work with other countries to promote
"the peaceful use of space and provide leadership in shaping
international norms for responsible behaviour in space" while supporting
efforts "to ensure that space does not become an arena of conflict."

"There are members in (NATO) who are vehemently opposed to the entire
idea of waging conflict in space, among which Canada is one," said
Kuan-Wei Chen, who is overseeing development of a manual dealing with
international law and the use of military force in space.

"Canada has become quite a leader in trying to establish fundamental

The document, published last week, is the result of a year of work by
Airbus Defence and Space, the German Space Agency at the German
Aerospace Center (DLR), and BSI, among others. It is focused on defining
minimum requirements for cyber security for satellites and, a cynic
might say, is a little late to the party considering how rapidly
companies such as SpaceX are slinging spacecraft into orbit.

The \"Normal\" category correlates to damage that is limited and
manageable. \"High\" is high-consequence damage that \"can significantly
limit the operation of the satellite system.\" As for \"Very High,\" the
attack could result in shutdown and \"reach an existentially
threatening, catastrophic extent for the operator or the manufacturer.\"

A Better U.S. Space Strategy

To address a perceived first mover advantage, there [[should be]{.mark}
an [increased focus on]{.mark} **[deterrence by
denial]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or what others have called dissuasion.
Often, dissuasion is used when describing actions "that should be taken
against those identified as posing a threat to American interests prior
to such potential adversaries having the actual capability to pose a
danger." To be effective, dissuasion [activities [must occur]{.mark}
**[before]{.mark}** a [threat **manifests**]{.mark}
**[itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Dissuasion
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[shaping]{.mark}
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**," [which can be
nonmilitary]{.underline} in scope [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[conducted during **peacetime**]{.underline}. A shaping example
[includes [growing]{.mark} the [number of allies]{.mark}]{.underline}
and partners [[who]{.mark} **[demonstrate resolve]{.mark}** in
preserving]{.underline} the peaceful and unfettered [access to
space]{.underline}.

A strategy incorporating dissuasion [[seeks to convey]{.mark} the
**[futility]{.mark}** [of conducting]{.mark} a [hostile]{.mark}
[act]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [[causing]{.mark} a]{.underline}
potential [[adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}'s leadership [[**not**
to]{.mark} pursue a military **[confront]{.mark}ation**]{.underline} in
the first place. Potential [adversaries]{.underline} may be
[**dissuaded** [if they]{.mark} [conclude]{.mark} that an
[attack]{.mark} in space will be **[ineffectual]{.mark}** in
achieving]{.underline} the [desired effect]{.underline}. In the parlance
of today's U.S. space professionals, this is the realm of space mission
assurance. **[[Space]{.mark} mission [assurance]{.mark}]{.underline}**
may [[include]{.underline}]{.mark} cross-domain or alternative
governmental, commercial, or [**international [capabilities]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} [result in]{.mark} a]{.underline} potential [[adversary
**not** seeking]{.mark} a military [confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [mission assurance
measures]{.underline}---[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the [internally
focused **[resiliency]{.mark} [characteristics]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
disaggregation, distribution, diversification, deception, protection,
and proliferation---[are all **appropriate** for **promoting
dissuasion** in space]{.underline}. To be clear, deterrence by
punishment should still have a part in U.S. space strategy, but there is
a demonstrated need to focus more on dissuasion efforts.
[[Suitable]{.mark} space]{.underline} dissuasion [[efforts]{.mark}
[include]{.mark} [fielding]{.mark} **multi-mode ground** [terminals that
utilize]{.mark} a [variety of]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite communication
frequency bands]{.underline}, ensuring multiple launch vehicle options
and dispersed geographic spaceport locations, and contracting with
several commercial Earth imaging and geolocation service providers.

countermeasures can be an **effective**]{.underline}, albeit a costly,
[means of **protecting them**]{.underline} from attacks. Typical
[countermeasures from attacks include **hardening**
satellites]{.underline}, providing them with maneuver capabilities,
having redundant systems, being able to quickly repair or replace
damaged or destroyed equipment, [dispersion of satellites into **wide
areas** of space]{.underline}, and denial and deception about a
satellite's capabilities.145 Certain [countermeasures can]{.underline}
be used to [protect satellites from]{.underline} specific types of
[attacks]{.underline}. For example, equipping satellites with shuttering
equipment can provide effective countermeasure against laser attacks.146
[Countermeasures can **deter** a country from attacking a

partners [in]{.mark} the **[space]{.mark} domain**]{.underline}. This is
partly due to significant obstacles, like classification and
releasability, that have impeded more and deeper defense space
partnerships. It also reflects the legacy of the Cold War, a period when
space was dominated by a few major powers. **[A new space era is upon

[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Concurrently, [potential
**[adversaries]{.mark}** are [developing weapons]{.mark} that could

**[seriousness]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[threat]{.mark}**
[demands]{.mark} a [more]{.mark} **[concerted]{.mark}** and
**[international approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this new space era,
[U.S. leadership should treat defense space partnerships as a
**strategic priority**]{.underline}.

Introduction

The United States has defense agreements with countries that represent
nearly a quarter of humanity, many of which are spacefaring nations.1
Yet, the United States has only had limited success in converting some
of its defense relationships into space security relationships. In 2019,
the United States and Norway agreed to include U.S.-protected
communications payloads on Norwegian satellites that will be launched in
late 2022, which will mark the first time the United States has put
operational national security payloads on a foreign satellite.2 Although
NATO's nuclear deterrent posture comprises a mix of U.S. and allied
capabilities, and British submarines deploy U.S.-made submarine-launched
ballistic missiles, we are just beginning to leverage the capabilities
of our international partners for military space assets and
operations.\*3

Unlike during the Cold War, when space was dominated by a few major
powers, [space has become increasingly democratized]{.underline}. [As of
2019]{.underline}, [over **60 countries** have a national space
budget]{.underline}, [over **70 countries** own or operate satellites in
orbit]{.underline}, [and **nine countries**]{.underline}---plus the
European Space Agency---[can independently launch into
orbit.]{.underline}4 This [growing international engagement in space
presents enormous opportunities for **defense space
partnerships**]{.underline}.

[This new era also presents serious risks]{.underline}. [[Space]{.mark}
is [becoming **increasingly contested**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In April
2020, Russia tested a direct ascent anti-satellite missile.5 A few
months earlier, U.S. officials called out Russian satellites for
trailing a U.S. national security satellite.6 Also in April 2020, Chris
Ford, a senior official in the State Department, said that China was
exploring capabilities to attack U.S. satellites, including in high
orbits such as those of U.S. nuclear command, control, and
communications satellites.7 [The [seriousness]{.mark} of the threat
[underlines]{.mark} the [importance]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**[defense]{.mark} [space]{.mark}
[partnerships]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should not]{.mark} [try]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [manage]{.mark} these threats purely **[on its
own]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To enable more international defense space partnerships, U.S. leadership
will need to treat such partnerships as a strategic priority, not as an
afterthought or add on. This chapter looks at advantages, challenges,
and mitigations for broadening and deepening security space partnerships
that could prompt key decision points during the next presidential term.

Advantages of Partnerships

[Defense [space]{.mark} [partnerships]{.mark} [offer]{.mark}
**considerable [advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These
[include]{.mark} [allowing]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to **expand**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[improve]{.mark}** its **[network]{.mark}** and
**capabilities**]{.underline} with fewer resources, [**[deter
adversaries]{.mark}** from attacking its systems]{.underline}, [[and
**coalesce allied**]{.mark} and partner **[thinking]{.mark}** on space
security concepts]{.underline}.8 A look at some common space maturity
metrics suggests that many of the most mature space nations in the world
are partners of the United States. Specifically:

The United States and its close partners make up 11 out of the top 15
countries with the biggest national space budgets.9

Of the roughly 2,700 active satellites in orbit, over 500 are operated
by international partners and over 1,300 are operated by the United
States.10

Among the world's 22 active space launch centers, six are operated by
partners and five by the United States.11

Many allies are also taking steps to emphasize the seriousness of space
security. In the past year, France and Japan have established their own
military units dedicated to space.12 The United Kingdom officially
recognized space as an operational domain in 2018.13 And NATO, which
historically has said little on space, came out with a space policy in
2019.14 Given the space maturity of many of its allies and partners, and
the shared recognition of the importance of the domain, the time is
advantageous for the United States to place more priority on
establishing and deepening space partnerships for defense.

[**Expand** and **Improve Networks** and **Capabilities**]{.underline}.
[[Partners]{.mark} [have capabilities]{.mark} [that]{.mark} can
[improve]{.mark} U.S. [systems]{.mark} and networks [in]{.mark}
geographically [dispersed]{.mark} and strategic
[locations]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [particularly true [in]{.mark}
**[s]{.mark}pace [s]{.mark}ituational [a]{.mark}wareness**]{.underline},
an area in which [a [diverse set of]{.mark} **geographically-distributed
[sensors]{.mark}** can [more accurately]{.mark} and completely
[capture]{.mark} the **[operational
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 [Partners can help us collectively
[attain]{.mark} more **[persistent surveillance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[continuous]{.mark} [global]{.mark} [coverage]{.mark}** of satellites
and debris]{.underline}, which is only possible if we have more and
better sensors in a variety of locations. Radars and optical telescopes
spread around the world can also more comprehensively identify space
threats. For example, Japan is developing a deep-space radar that will
observe objects in geosynchronous orbit. Given the counterspace threats
from potential adversaries, the radar could also be invaluable to the
United States because of its capability and location. 16

Additionally, space capabilities and operations are expensive. A [clear
advantage of military space partnerships is that they generate
opportunities for **sharing** the **financial burden** of operating in
space]{.underline}. As an example, the United States putting its
security payloads on the Norwegian satellite will reportedly generate up
to \$900 million in savings.17 Hosting U.S. payloads on foreign systems,
like this example, represents an area in which the United States could
leverage allied and partner capabilities more so than it does currently.
Hosted payloads offer affordable means to expand protected
communications satellites; position, navigation, and timing satellites;
and space situational awareness capabilities, among other systems.
Rather than host payloads, partners can also simply contribute to the
cost of a satellite system. For example, through multilateral
agreements, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New
Zealand provided funding for the U.S. Wideband Global SATCOM-9 satellite
that launched in March 2017.18 Or the United States can use partners'
satellites. For example, the United States partners with Japan and
Europe to obtain weather information from space-based sensors, providing
accurate weather information to warfighters around the world and
avoiding the need to field additional U.S. systems.19 And it is not just
satellites and payloads. Partners have terrestrial infrastructure and
user equipment, including for position, navigation, and timing and
satellite communications, that can be used collectively to achieve
needed capabilities more efficiently. Leveraging allied systems can
offer technological insights, system improvements, and capability
expansions at lower costs.

**[Deter Aggression]{.underline}**. [[Partnerships can]{.mark}
[create]{.mark} [opportunities]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
**[integrating]{.mark} allied** and partner
**[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such as incorporating combined
systems in satellite networks and ground infrastructure]{.underline}.
[Such [integration]{.mark} can **[strengthen]{.mark}** the
**[cohesiveness]{.mark}** of a defense partnership]{.underline}, [which
could]{.underline} also [[help]{.mark} [deter]{.mark} an
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. A potential adversary may consider an
attack on a purely U.S. system differently than an attack on a system
that incorporates several allied and partner capabilities. [Deployment
of NATO's multinational battlegroups in the eastern part of the
Alliance]{.underline} (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) [is an
example of this concept in the ground domain]{.underline}. If Russia's
military were to invade Estonia and attack the multinational forces
there, the invasion could be seen as not just an attack on Estonia but
on all of the countries represented in those forces and perhaps all of
NATO.20 A May 2017 NATO fact sheet on its multinational forces reaffirms
this: "\[The multinational\] presence makes clear that an attack on one
Ally will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance."21 Similarly,
in the space domain, an attack on a U.S. constellation of satellites
with U.S. payloads might prompt a response from the United States; an
attack on a satellite constellation with a mix of U.S. and partner
capabilities might prompt a response from several countries acting
collectively, which may help deter a potential adversary from attacking
in the first place.

[With integrated allied]{.underline} and partner [systems]{.underline},
[U.S. satellite networks and ground infrastructure]{.underline}, as well
as other equipment [and [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [can [become
more **resilient**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **more systems** you
have]{.underline}, [the **larger an attack** would need to be to take
out a given percentage of capability]{.underline}: all else equal, two
satellites would be more resilient than one, three satellites more
resilient than two, and so on. [The resilience offered by integrating
allied and partner capabilities into a network]{.underline}, therefore,
may also [[contribute to **deterring**]{.mark} a potential
**[adversary]{.mark}** from **[attack]{.mark}ing** the
**network**]{.underline}.

Coalesce Allied and Partner Thinking on Space Security Concepts. As part
of defense space partnerships, allies can more thoroughly discuss the
threats to space systems and potential space conflict scenarios. If the
United States wants to fully leverage its allies and partners in any
future conflict in space, the United States would benefit from having
more discussions with its allies about the possibility and nature of
such a conflict: how it might emerge, how the respective allies can
contribute, the capabilities the allies should pursue in advance, and
the actions that might constitute "red lines" or cross thresholds that
are more severe than others.

In recent years, the United States has taken important steps to
collaborate with allies and partners on space threats and space
conflict. International partners participate in military space exercises
such as Space Flag, Global Sentinel, and the Schriever Wargame.22 The
Five Eyes (the United States plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom) along with France and Germany all are members of the
Combined Space Operations initiative. 23 Experts we spoke to told us
that the United States should continue and expand these efforts. Partner
preparation for space conflicts could be valuable from an operational
and geopolitical perspective. Todd Harrison, Director of the Aerospace
Security Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies,
stated the following:

Rotating allies in the \[Combined Space Operations Center as part of the
Combined Space Operations initiative\] is important because it gives
those countries experts on space security issues. Let's say Russia or
China start interfering with our nuclear command and control and early
warning satellites. Any allied country needs to have their own experts
so they understand our response---they need folks who can say, "Yes, I
understand why the Americans are escalating over this."24

In a conflict in space, even if an allied country does not have
significant defense space capabilities, it should have an understanding
why the United States or other allied countries are taking the actions
that they are. That understanding might help that country support the
United States and allies politically and militarily in other domains.

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [having]{.mark} a **[shared
understanding]{.mark}** of space threats and space conflict will [help
in **peacetime**]{.mark} too]{.underline}. General John Raymond, the
Chief of Space Operations, has prioritized developing norms for
operating in space.25 [These could [include]{.mark}]{.underline}
something like [[taking steps to not create **debris**]{.mark} and
[announcing **planned maneuvers**]{.mark} into other
orbits]{.underline}.26 With a similar understanding of the issues,
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
allies will be better equipped to develop common ideas for responsible
behavior in space]{.underline}. [This will also help with multilateral
discussions]{.underline}, such as United Nations (UN) proposals on space
security. Our partners have not always supported U.S. positions on UN
space security proposals, including our negation of proposals made by
Russia and China. For example, in the 2014 UN vote on Russia's proposed
draft resolution on No First Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, only
three countries voted with the United States against the resolution and
125 voted for it with Russia.27 [[New]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[deeper
partnerships]{.mark}** will [create]{.mark} more [**commonality**
in]{.mark} **assumptions** and **[objectives]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
[fostering]{.mark} a **[safe]{.mark}** and [**secure** **space
environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--NATO Key

HBisevac)

4\. Capability Requirements

The [NATO Defence Planning Process]{.underline} (**[NDPP]{.underline}**)
[identifies **capability needs**]{.underline}. These requirements can be
identified through following the DOTMLPF-I (doctrine, organization,
training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities and
interoperability) capability development approach, which is analysed in
detail for space capabilities (see below).

Doctrine and policy

[[NATO needs to]{.mark} **[revise]{.mark}** [NATO]{.mark}
concept]{.underline}, [[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and doctrine
[[to]{.mark} [encompass]{.mark} the use of **[space systems]{.mark}**
and assets [in **military**]{.mark} **capabilities**]{.underline}. While
doctrine provides the main principles by which military forces shape and
guide their actions, policy provides the 'prudent course of action or
conduct to be applied in the application of a principle.' 61 [NATO has
**not yet agreed on a space doctrine**]{.underline}. Currently NATO is
developing a comprehensive Space Policy, which is a positive outcome of
the 2018 Brussels Summit.62

As [**[every]{.mark}** NATO [operation]{.mark} **requires** and
**[depends]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} **[space]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it is a [**fundamental
necessity** to develop]{.mark} a **[space doctrine]{.mark}** [to **guide
operations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Below are some [[guidelines]{.mark}
for the development of such a doctrine:]{.underline}

Identify the objectives, threats and principles;

Identify the level of ambition regarding the extent to which NATO wants
(or does not want) to become an autonomous actor in space;

[[Define]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark} offensive** and **defensive
[capabilities]{.mark}** [of **allies**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} **cyber defensive capabilities** for
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline};

[[Set]{.mark} out **[minimum capability req]{.mark}uirement[s]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} **[sat]{.mark}ellite [s]{.mark}ervices**]{.underline},
[[with consideration of]{.mark} **[non-survivability]{.mark}** of assets
[and]{.mark} **significance** of **[redundancy]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[and]{.underline}

Define the interaction with other organizations, including in the
private sector and partnerships. The NATO Industry Cyber Partnership,
launched in 2014, allows NATO to develop new concepts for technological
advancement. The senior cadres should prioritize science and technology
to a higher level in their agenda. The NATO--EU partnership is also
important, particularly because the EU's Galileo navigational system
could provide resilience to NATO systems.

Some of the issues cited above could be included in the forthcoming NATO
Space Policy, rather than in a doctrine. For instance:

A NATO Space Policy could identify the considerations of potential
Article 5 incidents, which is the principle of collective defence.
[[Cyberattacks]{.mark} [that]{.mark}]{.underline} might
[**[disturb]{.mark} [comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
**[destroy]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}** are more likely to
[constitute]{.mark} part of a **[broader]{.mark} [strategic]{.mark}
[campaign]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} an [isolated]{.mark}
[incident]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not the form a cyberattack takes,
but the impact of such an attack that would lead NATO members to
consider invoking Article 5.

It is also worth acknowledging the geographical nature of Article 5. The
North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty) of 1949 states: 'The Parties
agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe and
North America shall be considered an attack against them all \[...\]'.
[There is an interpretational challenge to this]{.underline}, as
cyberattacks are not bound by borders; moreover, they can be initiated
outside Europe or North America but might have an indirect impact on
those continents. The same applies to [[attacks]{.mark} on space
assets]{.underline}, since they [[lie]{.mark} **[outside]{.mark}
[territorial]{.mark} boundarie[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[NATO]{.mark} Space [Policy]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} [to take]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}to [account]{.mark} a **[geography]{.mark}** that includes
the **ownership** of these assets and the **geographical impact** of any
cyberattack on or through them]{.underline}.

NATO's deterrence and defence policy involves ballistic missile defence
(BMD), including interceptors, radars and the Active Layered Theatre
Ballistic Missile Defence (ALTBMD) capability, which is a single battle
management network that integrates all theatre ballistic missile
systems, such as the Patriot missiles,63 the SAMP-T system,64 and the
Medium Extended Air Defense System.65 Cybersecurity considerations
should include space technology that is used within the BMD capability.

While developing capabilities through doctrine and policies, legal
considerations also play a significant role. In the Wales Summit
Declaration of September 2014, NATO leaders agreed that a cyberattack
could trigger Article 5 (to be assessed on a case-by-case basis) and
that cyber domain was a valid operational area (similar to air, sea and
land). In principle, by extension, cyberattacks on space systems may
fall within this framework. The main question is whether a cyberattack
on a space system's software without kinetic consequences might be
considered as an armed attack that could trigger Article 5, or whether
there must be direct or indirect kinetic consequences (such as the
destruction of a satellite resulting in debris).66 There is also the
question of the application of international humanitarian law (IHL).
NATO has stated repeatedly that international law and IHL apply in
cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual, a non-binding advisory document,67 also
affirms the applicability of IHL to cyberspace. However, there are
questions over differentiating cyberattacks against military objectives
versus cyberattacks on civilian infrastructure, and over the assessment
of the proportionality of a cyberattack prior to its execution.
Realizing that civil and military assets are interlinked to a large
extent, it is hard to estimate whether an attack is proportionate or
not. Discussions with experts and NATO officials indicate that any
Article 5 consideration would depend on the severity, consequences and
political circumstances of an attack.

[In future the use of emerging technologies]{.underline}, which includes
AI, quantum-based cryptography, quantum computing [and the
[development]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [space]{.mark}-based internet
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, [will **[define]{.mark}** the
**[future of warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Finding [ways to
transfer]{.mark} all **necessary civilian [capability]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **[military]{.mark} [area]{.mark}** with appropriate
security measures could **[improve]{.mark} [NATO's]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [incorporating a
**[forward-looking approach]{.mark}** to its]{.underline} doctrine and
[policies would **[benefit NATO]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [long
run]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Organization

Based on open-source analysis and on information shared among the
members of the alliance, NATO is already mapping out the space
capabilities of its allies. This will help assess both NATO's existing
resources and those that will be required. How quickly NATO can be fully
operational in times of conflict and warfare and whether space is
integrated into the planning structure are both important issues.

[At the organizational level]{.underline}, [the following considerations
apply]{.underline}:

[The **[expertise]{.mark}** [on space]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
[rests]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the **[private]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[public]{.mark}** and **[military]{.mark}**
[sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Strengthening]{.mark} the
**[relationship]{.mark}** [across]{.mark} these three [sectors]{.mark}
would [improve]{.mark} [NATO's]{.mark} [organizational]{.mark}
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Although the cyber domain and space are intrinsically interlinked with
each other, day-to-day tasks may hinder the development of common
strategies by military staff. At the organizational level, there is
compartmentalization. Increasing the coordination between the space and
cyber communities would help to break down 'silos' (or barriers), and
personnel could be trained in multifaceted skills.

NATO could consider establishing new frameworks with the European Space
Agency. One such framework that has already come under discussion
includes the possible use of GNSS in military operations.

Training

Training is essential to create awareness and prepare the alliance for
worst case scenarios. NATO could promote different types of training
that would capture space security and system vulnerabilities to
cyberattacks. Training areas could be selected through a lessons-learned
analysis where former cases could be used to highlight areas of greatest
need.

Some examples are as follows:

At the political-strategic level, crisis management exercises (CMX),
hybrid warfare exercises and similar training could incorporate cyber
resilience and bring space elements into cybersecurity training.

At the technical level, given the complexity of space systems, focused
training, modelling and simulation would be key to ensuring design
integrity.

Bringing the technical and political communities together in training
modules would be helpful. Often the political community and technical
community do not metaphorically speak the same language and their
concerns do not merge. Such training would be technology-driven and
could incorporate modelling and simulation. Thus, technical expertise
and knowledge could be transferred into political action plans.

Training may also involve the private sector or contractors. NATO
decides whether or not it should delegate parts of the training to the
private sector or to conduct it internally. There are advantages and
disadvantages in both. One of the advantages in delegating the work to
an outside party is that the latter could conduct an analysis without
any NATO restrictions and could significantly test NATO's planning and
operations. The main disadvantage is that NATO may not be able to share
classified information, which would make the training less
comprehensive.

Some of the most useful training methods involve exercises, 'war
gaming', crisis simulations and scenario planning, as well as online
training education programmes, training manuals, and certifications.
NATO should also measure the impact of the training and assess its
skill-maintenance capacity.

Material

[**[Materiel]{.mark}** [involves]{.mark} **[military equipment]{.mark}**
and tools [that]{.mark} could [support]{.mark} the [**decision-making**
and **operational planning**]{.mark} entailed in considerations of the
space-based systems sector]{.underline}. [It also involves **logistics**
and **supply chain** management]{.underline}, and the integration of
cybersecurity system design into the mainstream development and design
of space systems. [Analysing which companies are **habitually relied**
upon in the supply of **satellite systems** may help NATO allies to
**prioritize** their supply chain security efforts]{.underline}.
Software vendors have control over putting 'back-doors' in the system
that may not be visible or known during the procurement stage.
Requesting the establishment of security requirements at the design
stage of a hardware project may also increase resilience and form part
of a defence-in-depth strategy.

Additional points to be considered with regards to materiel may include
the following:

Should NATO have some sort of space capability, and, if so, what should
the minimum capability be? Historically, NATO owned SATCOM capability,
but political considerations led to the decision to rely instead upon
the capabilities of alliance member states. To date, some countries
within the alliance have not shown sufficient interest in NATO having
its own satellite capability, and there has been no appetite to return
to the old system.

It is necessary to find approaches to incorporate EU assets and
equipment into NATO capability in order to increase redundancy.

Leadership

[[Leadership]{.mark} considerations involve awareness]{.underline},
[education and training in the **vulnerabilities** of **strategic
systems** to cyberattacks]{.underline}; leadership [capabilities
[should]{.mark} also [cover]{.mark} the issue of the defence sector's
**[interdependency]{.mark}** with other sectors while conducting its
operations]{.underline}. For instance, the telecommunications and
defence sectors both use commercial space assets. The mutual dependency
between the defence sector and other critical national infrastructure is
particularly important in understanding the possible consequences of a
cyberattack across all sectors.

Possible [ways to improve leadership-level involvement]{.underline} may
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark}:

[Conducting non-technical training for the North Atlantic
Council]{.underline} (**[NAC]{.underline}**) [on space
security]{.underline}. This type of training could also be conducted
with NATO's Military Committee and Supreme Commanders.

The establishment of a high-level scientific board comprising the chief
scientific advisers to NATO senior cadres. This group could distil any
technical information to the political group.

Personnel and facilities

Member states assign personnel to operate the NATO defence and military
systems that are dependent on space assets. Allies may also choose to
deploy space support teams to the conflict zone (such as those deployed
in Afghanistan by France and the US).68

The qualifications of personnel can be improved by:

Establishing personnel requirements for teams working on space issues.

Creating incentives for career promotion and retention of skills in
order to improve resilience.

Creating memoranda of understanding with the private sector to set up
joint work environments and establish hiring programmes where personnel
with security clearances would be working at NATO through private-sector
engagement.69

Finding ways to convince the member states to send highly qualified
personnel to NATO as nations bid to fill these posts. Creating minimum
requirements for the bidding process would help to attract personnel
with the right qualifications.

As with the model followed by Estonia in the cyber domain,70 it is
critical for alliance countries to start investing in programmes of
academic study on space technology, including at masters level, through
which NATO personnel can receive training and certification. Such
programmes will equip personnel with essential skills and provide the
alliance member states with qualified assets.

Interoperability

[**[Interoperability]{.mark}** [enables]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [operate]{.mark} their space [systems]{.mark} without having
to make adaptations so that their systems can **function
[efficiently]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Interoperability has been an issue in the land, air, and maritime
domains. [Space-assets planning would benefit from the lessons learned
in those domains]{.underline} -- for instance, [by]{.underline} studying
and [understanding the complexities involved in
intelligence]{.underline}- [and information-sharing across all
domains]{.underline}. Allies could allocate funds towards a body of work
that could focus on interoperability in space. Doctrines and
[**[standardization]{.mark}** could help to [improve
interoperability]{.mark} **[among]{.mark} [allie]{.mark}d
[s]{.mark}ystems**]{.underline}. Yet, allies should also realize that
standardization would mean using the same vectors as a baseline, thus
leading to an increase in risk (in the remaining vulnerabilities) across
the alliance as a whole. Allies should realize that standardization
would mean using the same vectors as a baseline, thus leading to an
increase in risk across the alliance as a whole. In order to share
secure information through SATCOM units, France, Germany, Norway and the
US have formed the multilateral Coalition Network for Secure Information
Sharing (CoNSIS). Through secure communications systems, CoNSIS's
objective is to enable better and more accurate decision-making, within
a shorter period of time.71

In order to ease interoperability, CoNSIS uses commercial standards as
its baseline.72 For future applications, it is advisable to check
whether commercial standards meet cybersecurity demands for military
requirements.

Interoperability in technology is desirable but remains a challenging
construct. [It [could]{.mark} [become]{.mark} the [role of **NATO** to
make]{.mark} national [space]{.mark} [services]{.mark}
**[interoperable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Creating a catalogue of
national services might be a good starting point.
[[Interoperability]{.mark} could also be [established at]{.mark} the
[product]{.mark} [level]{.mark}]{.underline} ([for example]{.underline},
[[in]{.mark} the [field]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[space weather]{.mark}**
[info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation) [[where]{.mark} the [products]{.mark}
are **[standardized]{.mark}** across the alliance]{.underline}. In order
to incentivize nations to invest in this endeavour, it might be helpful
to calculate the cost of inadequate interoperability across the alliance
to demonstrate current or potential monetary losses.

NATO has experience embedding space-based tools into terrestrial,
maritime, and airpower exercises. However, [NATO has yet to build
space]{.underline}-[specific exercises to signal **allied
resolve**]{.underline}. This may be deliberate, stemming from an
assumption that future conflict in outer space would be inextricably
linked to Earth-based competition. Even if this assumption is true, it
does not absolve NATO from the need to answer questions about potential
allied resolve in bringing force to bear against those who interfere
with space operations. Clearly, NATO recognizes the benefits of space
systems and has considered how to integrate these vital capabilities
into security operations. However, without a declaratory policy, it is
impossible to gauge how far (if at all) NATO is willing to go to protect
key space systems.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg briefly outlined types of
cooperation supported by the new policy, notably that alliance members
can expect streamlined sharing arrangements for space-based services
like encrypted communications and remote sensing. By promoting
cooperation, the NATO policy leverages the collective allied portfolio
of space-based technologies to supplement lost capabilities and negate
adversarial interference with space systems. [Many [NATO]{.mark} members
are **undeniably [proficient]{.mark}** [in **space**]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}nology** and [can contribute]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
**[sharing]{.mark} [agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[NATO]{.mark}
members]{.underline} other than the United States [have nearly
**[tripled]{.mark}** the number of [satellites]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[orbit]{.mark} in the past decade]{.underline}. The [increase in
satellites [improves]{.mark} the [potential for]{.mark} [sharing]{.mark}
**unique [data]{.mark}** [and **capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} also [builds **beneficial**]{.mark} **[redundant]{.mark}
[layers]{.mark}** [within]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} space
[ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [redundancies help
[bridge]{.mark} [the]{.mark} gap [between]{.mark} growing military
[**reliance** on]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the inherent [**[fragility]{.mark}** of space
objects]{.underline}. [Reducing **barriers** to sharing space
**systems** and **data**]{.underline} might also [**encourage** allies
to discuss **strategic investments** to address any gaps]{.underline}.

The policy also establishes NATO as a forum for consultation between
allies on space issues, although it is unclear to what extent the policy
guides these consultations and what sort of newfound legitimacy the
policy affords these consultations. However, it is undeniable that
simply announcing a policy, even a classified one, sparks a conversation
not only formally within the North Atlantic Council but informally
between allies. Unfortunately, sharing and consultation do not address
the alliance's most conspicuous vulnerabilities in space.

Pursuing Protection or Encouraging Inefficiency?

Most [NATO members who have]{.underline} dramatically
[expanded]{.underline} their [reliance on satellite infrastructure have
done so **without** commensurate **increases** in space-based
**ability** to]{.underline} prevent or [**deter** hostile
interference]{.underline} with these systems. It is a state's
prerogative to improve resiliency and security, but inadequate security
baselines affect both intra-alliance agreements and NATO operations as a
whole. Even with sufficient security standards, potential sharing
arrangements do not replace sovereign capabilities, principally because
allies do not have guaranteed access to shared systems for independent
and joint missions. Notably, some NATO allies have reservations about
ceding control of space systems to foreign commanders during a crisis.
This might drive NATO members away from beneficial redundancies and
toward inefficient replication. Furthermore, [it is [unclear
that]{.mark} the current [NATO]{.mark} [space ecosystem]{.mark} is
**[adequately]{.mark} [layered]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
**[redundancies]{.mark}**]{.underline} to realize the benefits supported
by the policy. Extensive sharing might also push states toward fragile
interdependencies, and a dearth of sophisticated redundancies would make
those capabilities --- unsupported by substitute systems as they are ---
valuable targets. NATO might not be able to wholly address both of these
issues, but it can make progress on other concerns.

Despite some allies' interests in counterspace technology, NATO has not
indicated that it has a plan, at any classification level, to integrate
such capabilities into its concepts of operation. Furthermore, [NATO
does not have a]{.underline} comprehensive unclassified [strategy to
deter adversarial interference with NATO members' space-based
systems]{.underline}. NATO declaratory policy does not delineate
space-based thresholds or actions that would trigger NATO to act in
collective defense. This is especially troubling, as NATO itself
recognizes that commitments to collective defense must "be clearly and
unambiguously communicated to avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation
by any potential adversary." The resolve that underpins all alliance
security activities is severly undermined by the alliance's inability or
unwillingness to openly communicate about space security.

NATO also lacks the tools, tactics, and procedures to effectively
operate in space. NATO has neither announced an intent to implement a
space situational awareness program to identify and attribute on-orbit
interference, nor convened debate on a collective threat-assessment
process. These are two core tasks that should be accomplished to support
the alliance's relevance in space security. Shared threat-assessment
tools are key for states interested in building meaningful coalitions to
address space security. Without agreed-upon threat-assessment processes,
allies may arrive at different conclusions about threats to space
systems, based in part on their differing abilities to collect and
analyze data. This directly impacts the alliance's ability to come to a
consensus decision under the processes outlined by Article 4 of the NATO
Charter. While some actors like the United States have robust space
situational awareness capabilities, others don't. NATO members may not
have comparable capacities to observe or monitor space activities,
leaving allies unable to assess independently collected data.
Compounding this, even perfect data cannot protect NATO from
disagreements based on differing opinions about a space actor's intent.
Without common methods or an established procedure for space observation
and shared threat-assessment tools, NATO may be unable to arrive at a
conclusion and may cede initiative back to an adversary.

Extending Collective-Defense Protections to Allied Space Assets

NATO should adopt a space strategy to guide the alliance forward in
security-affirming activities. Without a declaratory policy, NATO's
public statements provide an imprecise outline of how NATO will behave
in space. The announcement to designate space as an operational domain
included a disclaimer that NATO has "no intention to put weapons into
space," but NATO leadership has not ruled out integrating terrestrial
counterspace capabilities into NATO concepts of operations. NATO may be
setting the groundwork for future space activities, but in the meantime
should take specific steps to improve allied security.

At the highest level, NATO has an opportunity to blanket allied space
assets with Article 5 protections. Article 6 of the NATO Charter
clarifies that the alliance may only invoke collective defense in
response to attacks on territory or vessels operating north of the
Tropic of Cancer. The geographic limits imposed by the NATO Charter are
incongruent with outer space. Revising this language to specifically
include satellites, independent of their location above the Earth, would
support collective defense. Attacks, harassment, or interference with
space objects anywhere in orbit could degrade NATO capabilities in a
transatlantic theater. Expanding the parameters of Article 6 would send
strong signals to adversaries that threats to space-based assets will
not be tolerated.

While this would be an unambiguous and security-reinforcing progression,
the recent history of decision-making in Brussels suggests that such an
amendment might require an immense political capital investment by those
states most interested in protecting space-based assets. There is little
reason to expect political will to be suddenly galvanized in an effort
to revisit the terms of the core alliance-forming document. Furthermore,
while space security has enjoyed the spotlight recently, it may be
overshadowed in the future evolving security environment.

Fortunately, other less-taxing activities can benefit allied space
security.

NATO should issue an overarching strategy and doctrinal guidance for
military spacepower to accompany the policy. NATO has a unique advantage
as a collective organization to convene strategists from likeminded but
diverse military backgrounds who could cooperatively develop a
warfighting strategy for space. A space-focused center of excellence
would be well-suited to address this gap, and would be able to leverage
institutional credibility. There are many allied countries with distinct
interests in space security that might be interested in leading the
effort, and a diverse cadre of experts would support the development of
a comprehensive space strategy.

At the operational level, [[NATO can]{.mark} better [integrate
space]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology [into]{.mark} **security
[missions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Current NATO doctrine and strategy
outline the way allied commanders should leverage space-based systems
during combat operations. These policies focus on using space to support
other domains, and give no guidance on how the alliance would conduct
operations in space. Although NATO will not deploy weapons in space, the
alliance can craft contingencies to fit within the bounds of this
restriction and not erode the credibility of its pledge not to weaponize
space. NATO should take advantage of the current tractability of the
normative environment in space to develop sound plans for space-based
activities and not wait until immense pressures force leadership to make
decisions under duress. This includes considering how to best leverage
terrestrial-based counterspace capabilities, including jamming tools,
directed energy technologies, and air-, land-, or sea-lauched kinetic
interceptors, or if the alliance should avoid using specific weapons
entirely.

The absence of a crisis in space is not an excuse to neglect the
importance of integrating new space activities with structural and
systematic processes. [**[Integrated]{.mark} [situational]{.mark}
[awareness]{.mark}** is [crucial as NATO]{.mark} [expands]{.mark} into
space]{.underline}. [The **[various levels]{.mark}** [of
**maturity**]{.mark} in sovereign space systems within
NATO]{.underline}, combined with the federated structure of the alliance
and the complex impacts of space technology, [[demand]{.mark} effective
**[integration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This integration process should
focus on implementing robust baseline security standards for space
systems to enable cooperation without concerns about inviting threats
through the weakest security node. Another focus should be ensuring the
alliance has the ability to arrive at political decisions about taking
collective action in space.

The [NATO [***roadmap*** to better]{.mark} space [security]{.mark}
[starts with]{.mark} [defining]{.mark} a [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}
and a concept of operations [[to]{.mark} re[establish]{.mark} an

on these developments, [[NATO]{.mark} will [be able to focus]{.mark}
**joint training** and [exercises to **enhance**]{.mark} **[allied
capacities]{.mark}** to prevent]{.underline}, [defend
against]{.underline}, [and recover from attacks on space

[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[demonstrate]{.mark} allied
[resolve]{.mark} to protect and leverage space systems]{.underline} in

[[Alliance]{.mark}s]{.underline}, [international
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the global
prolif]{.underline}eration [of space power]{.underline} also
[[play]{.mark} a **[significant role]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [deterrence
by denial]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[international]{.mark} dimension
[influences deterrence]{.mark} in several ways]{.underline}. First, the
[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[of states]{.mark}
operating]{.underline} or deriving benefits from
[[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} [creates]{.mark} [stakeholders]{.mark} who
would]{.underline} likely [[prefer]{.mark} that their
[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} were [not]{.mark} put [in
**jeopardy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. States outside of the deterrence
relationship may have their satellites affected negatively if deterrence
fails and conflict ensues, such as by orbital debris from kinetic
attacks or the indiscriminate effects of broad radio-frequency jamming.
Second, the deterring state may provide a global or multinational
space-derived service, such as the US Global Positioning System
satellites, which if attacked could potentially draw countries reliant
on this service into the conflict on the side of the non-aggressor
(Harrison et al. 2009). In these situations, an aggressor may be
hesitant to attack space systems if it will have to potentially contend
with an international response (Sheldon 2008). Third, allied or partner
states may assist the deterring state when a conflict breaks out. The
[[space systems]{.mark} of friendly countries can [complement]{.mark}
[and supplement]{.mark} the [deterrer's]{.mark} own
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as [[through data
sharing]{.mark} **agreements**]{.underline},
**[[interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
even [by [assisting]{.mark} in the **[reconstitution]{.mark}** of lost
space capabilities]{.underline}. [[Adversary leadership]{.mark} may be
[**deterred** from **targeting US sat**]{.mark}**ellite[s]{.mark}** [if
they perceive]{.mark} that the]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [could
[leverage]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark} to **nullify** any anticipated benefit]{.underline}
(Sheldon 2008).

Some security experts consider the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) as being [**[uniquely positioned]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} [bolster deterrence]{.mark} in space [through]{.mark} its
**[cooperative alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[alliance]{.mark}
is [increasingly reliant]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [space for]{.mark} its
[collective]{.mark} [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic
prosperity, [and an attack on the space assets of any one ally impacts
the security of all allies]{.underline} (Schulte 2012). Security experts
assert that [while NATO is dependent on space-enabled
capabilities]{.underline}, its [space doctrine and planning have **not
kept up**]{.underline}. Presently, NATO officials are considering how
the alliance should address the growing military capabilities of Russia
and China, to include issuing NATO's first strategy for space. The
strategy is expected to make space an official domain of operation,
giving structure to discourse on military developments in space and
NATO's response. The alliance may also decide that attacks in space
would trigger the organization's Article 5 provisions on collective
defense, although internal differences on the subject remain.

**[effectively exploit]{.mark}** [space]{.mark}-based
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schulte 2012). It is still uncertain
whether NATO's space strategy will implement these recommendations.

#### Only NATO offers the [necessary capabilities]{.underline} to deter China.

Cyber and [space is a promising arena for NATO to address China
challenges by building **member state resilience**]{.underline}. Like
the air and sea domains, as areas that belong to no one state and which
provide access to much of the globe, they form part of the global
commons. [Command of the commons has been the **key enabler** of the
**US global position** of **power**]{.underline} for many decades.26
However, [China wields a sufficient range of sea]{.underline},
[air]{.underline}, [cyber]{.underline}, [and space
capabilities]{.underline} such [that the **global commons** is now a
**contested zone**]{.underline}. In contrast to the sea and air domains,
cyber and [space]{.underline} are **[sparsely regulated]{.underline}**.
This [lack of international norms enhances the risk of conflict based on
misperception]{.underline}, [making **NATO cooperation**
**pertinent**]{.underline}. [Adversarial activities toward the US and
Europe in]{.underline} the cyber and [space]{.underline} domain
[threaten transatlantic security]{.underline}. [These come]{.underline}
not just [from **China**]{.underline}, but also from other adversaries
such as [**Russia** and **Iran**]{.underline}. Mechanisms for addressing
these challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not,
at least in their basic design, established with a particular country in
mind. Thus, cyber and [space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute
**significantly** to **deterrence** of China]{.underline} without having
to combat major internal resistance. [NATO would]{.underline} also
[benefit from long-standing **US-EU cooperation** on]{.underline} cyber
and [space]{.underline} issues.27 Cyber and space provide an avenue for
NATO to contribute without major internal resistance

NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's collective defense commitment
to encompass threats to satellites in space and coordinated
cyberattacks. NATO can design this effort to include adversarial
behavior from China. The alliance already has an array of instruments to
deal with cyber and space challenges from adversaries. These can be
extended to encompass China without pronouncing it a threat.28 This
approach allows the US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation to
take into account the fact that China poses military threats to them
both without explicitly using the language of threat at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability of shared space assets to
cyberattacks has been a concern for both the US and Europe. For example,
in 1998 a US-German satellite, used for peering into deep space, was
rendered useless after it turned suddenly toward the sun, damaging its
High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA later determined that the
accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at the Goddard Space Flight
Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat to both
the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about eighteen
minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous network
traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet traffic to
travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the world quickly
adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including government and
military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's destinations
through servers located in China.29

In the future, [the need to enhance situational awareness in space is
likely to lead to further integration of space assets between the US and
its allies]{.underline}. Civilian entry points are likely to provide a
growing opportunity for infiltration. The weak state of cybersecurity in
civilian agencies should also be considered. Chinese military doctrine
prioritizes weaponry that targets vulnerabilities in the deployment of
US and allied power, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.30 These threats are significant, since next generation systems,
including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, will not
function without access to space communication and space-derived data.

Although European and US allies have indigenous space programs outside
the NATO framework, cyber security and outer space would be a useful
field for joint explorations of how to divert and manage attacks and
identify an agency which can coordinate transatlantic responses to
attacks. Allies are embedded in a range of information networks which
may be disrupted, giving rise to alliance management concerns emerging
from attacks. [The lack of **red lines** regarding behavior
in]{.underline} cyber and [outer space between the US and its
allies]{.underline} on one hand, [and adversaries]{.underline} such as
China on the other, [adds to the risk of **misperception** and
**escalation**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} hence also [highlights
the need for **allied coordination** to avoid starting a war by
mistake]{.underline}. An improved NATO dialogue on safeguards and
alliance consultation could also assist communication with China on arms
control and conflict prevention in cyber and outer space, which is not
currently taking place.

Looking to the future, [NATO's success in establishing **transatlantic
mechanisms** for]{.underline} cyber and [outer **space safeguards** and
**consultation** will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in taking on
the China challenge in ways that help restore faith in **NATO's
credibility** as a provider of **collective defense**]{.underline} in
all domains. It will also assist NATO in straddling the chasm between
member states prioritizing threats from either China, Russia, the Middle
East, or North Africa, since cyber and space threats potentially stem
from all of them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense
mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

Cyber and space would allow NATO a key role in the China challenge
without prioritizing China

[Improved **communication** between NATO]{.underline} and the EU [will
be essential for NATO to successfully address the military aspects
of]{.underline} cyber and [space threats]{.underline}. The framework for
permanent EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was concluded in March 2003.
It allows for the exchange of classified information, the EU's use of
NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led crisis management operations,
and the establishment of consultation arrangements.31 Due to
disagreements over responsibilities and jurisdiction, however,
meaningful coordination did not take place until July 2016. On this
occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration stating their
intention to work together on security and defense responses to
unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East of the
Euro-Atlantic area.32 During Biden's visit to Brussels in June 2021,
NATO promised to strengthen cooperation with the EU on promoting peace
and stability including protecting critical infrastructure,
strengthening resilience, maintaining a technological edge, and
addressing challenges to a rules-based order.33 The EU-US summit
statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support for robust
NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the partnership.34 At the
level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO and EU
officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies and
tactics for countering China challenges.35

The EU-US summit statement's negligible mention of cooperation with NATO
indicates that the ball is in NATO's court if strengthening NATO-EU
coordination is to take place. French and German concerns about
entrapment are a major barrier to meaningful NATO-EU cooperation. The
area of cyber and space security may allow NATO to work around this
roadblock. In line with the EU's practice of supporting the efforts of
groups of member states to take the lead on issues where EU institutions
cannot trump sovereignty, in the area of cybersecurity the EU has
decentralized implementation to work around national resistance. This
has allowed the EU to respond collectively and effectively to
cyberattacks in Europe, primarily through bolstering capacities and law
enforcement cooperation.36 However, the EU is not yet a globally
influential and effective cyber-power because differences among member
states over issues such as whether to prioritize tech sovereignty or
Europe's global tech competitiveness prevent the EU from acting in
unison on the global stage.

The first US-EU TTC meeting held in September 2021 was an important step
in strengthening the EU's global position in cooperation with the United
States, and hence called into question whether NATO has a role to play
in cyber security.37 The next couple of years will demonstrate whether
the EU and the US are able to focus on becoming mutually supportive
global cyber security guardians by cooperating on strengthening
investment screening, export controls, and rebalance global supply
chains in semiconductors. The successful implementation on both sides of
the Atlantic of the recommendations of the TTC working groups will
determine if transatlantic cooperation positions the US and the EU as
global partners in guarding cyber space. In part, this will depend on
the EU's ability to forge common positions that meet the US halfway on
issues such as tech sovereignty and data privacy, points of contention
through which transatlantic relations have been marred by conflict.

The potential convergence of transatlantic views on cybersecurity leaves
room for NATO to play a significant role because the EU is a civilian
and economic, rather than military, set of institutions. The NATO summit
in Brussels in 2018 carved out a role for NATO which the EU cannot
fulfill, allowing NATO members to integrate their sovereign cyber
capabilities into NATO operations and missions.38 However, compared to
the EU's major role in cyber, NATO's role is negligible. As EU
civil-military cooperation ramps up in enhancing Europe's autonomous
defense profile while allowing US companies a role in this effort, the
union looks set to become an even more dominant actor in transatlantic
cyber defense. Because NATO is a military organization, it has the
procedures and instruments to position itself in a key role in
coordinating and implementing the military aspects of cyber defense
between the US and Europe. The multinational cybersecurity effort which
is confronting the global threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored
cyberattacks involves NATO, the EU, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan,
and sets NATO off to a good start in enhancing its profile in countering
Chinese challenges to transatlantic cybersecurity.39 However, it remains
to be seen if it manages to deliver mechanisms that succeed in
integrating allied responses in the military sector in a way that
complements US and EU cyber defense initiatives.

In outer space, the EU is also increasingly active, recognizing the need
to deepen investments in areas such as satellite navigation, earth
observation, space situational awareness, and secure communications,
which are all central to enhanced space security. The EU has established
the EU Agency for the Space Programme, which has oversight over
everything the EU does in orbit as a bloc. Moreover, the EU uses the
European Space Agency (ESA) as technical advisor and industrial
procurement agent. This setup allows the EU to become more agile,
dynamic, and innovative in space as rapid industrialization is taking
place with US entrepreneurs and well-funded Chinese space programs in
leading roles.40 In the pipeline are a next generation of Europe's
satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and an extension of the scope and
capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitors the
state of the planet. The EU focuses on ensuring that Europe has
independent space capabilities, but it does not develop instruments such
as space weapons systems.41

[In the]{.underline} outer [space realm]{.underline}, [NATO has
**tremendous potential** for playing a **key role** in developing
instruments in the military sector that involve European and US space
capabilities]{.underline}. NATO's decision to declare outer space an
operational domain at the London summit in 2019 is a first step in
allowing NATO an active role in addressing growing anti-satellite
threats from China and Russia.42 [With the **US** as the **leading
power** in outer space and with the **EU** developing its space
platforms to enhance **situational awareness** and
**security**]{.underline}, [NATO has the tools to work out a **common
transatlantic definition** of the **anti-satellite**
**challenges**]{.underline} that need to be addressed. The
[establishment of mechanisms that ensure **coordination** across
military NATO commands regarding **intelligence gathering** and the
interface]{.underline} between cyber and [space defense]{.underline}, as
well as civilian and military occurrences and initiatives,
[would]{.underline} potentially [strengthen the ability of allies to
**counter** anti-satellite threats **considerably**]{.underline}. As
with cyber, [NATO must]{.underline} first [integrate the space issue
into all its **organizational** and **operational
structures**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} secondly, [develop
mechanisms that focus on **coordination** between US and European
capacities on the basis of a **common understanding** of]{.underline}
the [challenges]{.underline} to be addressed.

6.1.2 Increase NATO Strategic Level Engagement

As stated by Moon, [**[one Ally's]{.mark}** space
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline} **[being [attacked]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[will impact]{.mark} **each [other's]{.mark}**]{.underline} MS's
[security]{.underline} (Moon, 2017, p. 8). [[Hence]{.underline}]{.mark},
the strategic **[[coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}** of space asset
cybersecurity [[is **vital**]{.mark} for all]{.underline} NATO
**[pillars of defence]{.underline}**, whilst [increased
involvement]{.underline} of CSCRM [should become a **top priority**
for]{.underline} NATO's [strategic level executives]{.underline}.
Eventually, [[this]{.mark} would [allow]{.mark}]{.underline} for [a
**[whole-of-alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[approach to
**deter**]{.underline}]{.mark} space-based
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} through showcasing the importance and
visibility of the cyber SASC (Yuval, 2019, p. 6). Following AJP-3.20,
NATO commanders are required to

> "continuously monitor their areas of interest to anticipate potential
> crises and allow them to assist the strategic level in understanding
> \[which\] includes an analysis of cyberspace as part of the overall
> understanding of the operating environment \[and\] potential risks to
> friendly or neutral usage of cyberspace \[...\] against NATO, Member
> States, or neutral nations/entities (NSO, 2020, pp. 23-24).

This implies the creation of mission-specific guidance, agreements,
arrangements, and security considerations. Aligning, NIST emphasises on
CSCRM as

> "a critical capability required for organizations to reduce the risk
> of business interruption if a cyber incident were to occur
> \[requiring\] close integration across functional and business lines,
> engage executive leadership effectively \[...\] foster close supplier
> relationships, and leverage industry standards throughout the supply
> chain lifecycle" (NIST, 2020, p. 5).

To integrate the strategic level more effectively,
[**[executive-level]{.mark}** SC [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[councils]{.underline}** [should be
**established**]{.underline}]{.mark} [throughout]{.underline}
[NATO]{.underline} (NIST, 2020, p. 5). Education on cyber SASC risk
management should be introduced to NATO CCDCOE's recurrent Executive
Cyber Seminars. Widmann considers [those seminars]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} the [most **appropriate level** [to
discuss]{.mark}]{.underline} [SC issues]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
cyber **[[incidents]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
**[consolidate]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategic [[understanding
of]{.underline}]{.mark} space [asset]{.underline}
**[[cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** and NATO's critical dependence
on it (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). The aim is to "provide the senior
leadership with a baseline of information, so that if they are faced
with a cyber issue in the SASC, they would have the information that
they need to make good decisions" (Widmann, 2020). Furthermore, as
stated by Unal, the annual NATO Information Assurance Symposium (NIAS)
could focus on space in the upcoming years. In doing so, NIAS could
support the clarification on responsibilities and protection measures,
and suggest highergrade military cyber protection as well as security
specifications for critical civilian space applications used by the
military (Unal, 2019, p. 16). Such executive-level gatherings will
showcase commitment, formalize responsibilities and therefore
effectively ensure CSCRM (NIST, 2020, pp. 8- 13). Concrete strategic
decisions to timely increase resources, which might be decided upon
during such seminars, include:

> \- The overall review and extension of space management within the
> NCIA, and SpSC's role;
>
> \- Forming an organic SpSCE at each tactical-level HQ, being
> permanently staffed by at least one SME or liaison officer (Vasen,
> 2020, pp. 21-23);
>
> \- Establishing a Direct Liaison Authority (DIRLAUTH) between the
> operational level and national space capacity providers to reduce
> requesting times (Vasen, 2020, pp. 23-25); and
>
> \- Establishing a stand-alone space operations AJP to properly
> acknowledge and consider increasingly complex space capabilities.

6.1.3 Spur Exchange of Academic Expertise

[[**NATO dependency** on]{.mark} untrusted]{.underline}
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology [should be
**[counteracted]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[strategic]{.underline} **[investment]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
space [asset]{.underline} Research and Development
(**[[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [in]{.underline} [collaboration with
its MS]{.underline}, and hence the development of more viable
alternatives (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). [This might be **done in
collaboration**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [the
existing]{.underline} NATO Science and Technology Organisation
(**[STO]{.underline}**) Information [Systems]{.underline} Technology
Panel (NATO STO, 2020). As stated by Silverstein,

> "NATO has a unique advantage as a collective organization to convene
> strategists from likeminded but diverse military backgrounds \[...\] a
> diverse cadre of experts would support the development of a
> comprehensive space strategy" (Silverstein, 2020, p. 7).

Livingstone suggests inviting outside organisations and cybersecurity
experts to provide expertise and differing perspectives on the topic and
focus more on including cybersecurity into space asset's designs. This
might include for example to further spur cooperation between NATO and
Europol, in particular between NCIA and the European Cybercrime Centre
(EC3) via Europol's Platform for Experts (EPE). EPE is a "secure,
collaborative web platform for specialists \[which\] facilitates the
sharing of: best practices; documentation; innovation; knowledge;
non-personal data on crime" (EUROPOL, 2020). Exchange and collaboration
are enabled via virtual communities, sharing a wide range of expertise,
know-how, and information, to foster an environment of trust and online
collaboration. Thus, "[**governments** should **not
compete**]{.underline} [with industry but instead]{.underline} [**take
advantage** of the]{.underline} expertise in the [industry]{.underline}
[and help]{.underline} to **[spur innovation]{.underline}** going
forward" (Bander et al., 2020). Hence, [[NATO]{.underline}
[will]{.underline}]{.mark} be allowed to **[[encourage
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[competition]{.underline}** and drive excellence on the market,
[[whilst ensuring]{.underline}]{.mark} [that the]{.underline}
[**appropriate levels** of [security]{.mark} are
[met]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This will]{.underline} prevent companies
from striving for private capital outside MS and may [help to
**[overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline} industry [competitors'
**[reluctance]{.mark} to share knowledge**]{.underline} (GSA, 2019, p.
2). Also, common R&D will help to draft a common terminology within NATO
and beyond, as technical cyber-speak should be adjusted and translated
for the political space community (Waterman, 2019).

NATO currently reviews the establishment of a NATO Space Technology
Centre (Waterman, 2020, pp. 1-6). Such a centre would

> "bring together the various space-related activities of the NCIA, from
> SATCOM and research to operational support \[...\] summarized in a
> so-called "virtual hub" for space knowhow, projects and tools" (Kanig
> & Forkert, 2020, p. 1).

[[This is **important**]{.underline} [for the]{.underline}]{.mark}
needed [acceleration of NATO **space awareness**]{.underline} [and the
fielding]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [new]{.underline} military
[capabilities]{.underline}, [facing for example the [rise
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence79
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), further shifting the cyber landscape
for space systems as space assets increasingly employ AI capabilities.
Not only will NATO need to worry about cyber doctrine and how it
interacts with space, but AI doctrine and how it intersects with cyber
and space. Furthermore, the centre should be led by or involve NCIA in
cooperation with other COEs like CCDCOE, to "give advice on relevant
cyberthreats and vulnerabilities, such as those related to the integrity
or security of supply chains" (Unal, 2019, p. 26). This involves
research and recommendations for agreement on what exactly constitutes
space as a domain, what type of similarities and divergence space shares
with cyber, and finally what kind of SC security approach should be
modelled for NATO (Unal, 2019, p. 28). In that way, technological
advancements can be more securely incorporated in future NATO
procurement of space asset services (Zarkan, 2020).

6.1.4 Conduct Mission-Specific Cyber SASC Risk Assessments

NATO needs to make sure to know the procurement and SC environment
around each specific mission, sourcing the materials and services to the
level of integrity required (Livingstone, 2020). External partners
should be analysed based on an exact understanding and agreement on each
mission's unique risk tolerance and critical assets, to better ensure
responsibilities and liabilities (Lister, 2020). [**[Risk
assessment]{.mark}** policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[between MS and NATO]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[highly
[needed]{.mark}]{.underline}** ["[so that everybody]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[agrees]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[**same [concept]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} diligence,
**[[safety]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and **risk
management**]{.underline}" (Lee, 2020). Silverstein points out that

> "[without **agreed-upon**]{.underline} threat-assessment
> [processes]{.underline}, [allies]{.underline} [may arrive at
> **different conclusions**]{.underline} about threats to space systems,
> based in part on their differing abilities to collect and analyse
> data. This directly **[impact]{.underline}**s [the]{.underline}
> [alliance's **ability** to]{.underline} [come to a
> **consensus**]{.underline} decision" (Silverstein, 2020).

NIST encourages the move "from detective to preventive capabilities in
managing third-party cybersecurity risk" (NIST, 2020, p. 10) through
establishing a proper SC cyber risk assessment framework. Doing so would
ensure cyber SC risk accountability across the organization through
manifesting policies, governance, procedures, tools and processes, as
well as integrity, visibility and control over data sent to and received
by any supplier (NIST, 2020, pp. 9-13). Furthermore, risks assessments
are essential to "identify \[,\] determine \[and\] estimate the
likelihood of the potential losses, \[and\] define the relative
likelihood and consequence of various risks" (Pandey et al., 2020, p.
16). A proper NATO SASC cyber risk assessment framework should therefore
include:

1\. Assessment of NATO-procured ICT components, such as hardware,
software, and services:

Common [**risk [assessment]{.mark}** [includes]{.mark}]{.underline}
collaboratively and **[proactively]{.underline}** [using
software]{.underline} [to **[monitor]{.mark} SC
[interruptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[implement]{.underline}]{.mark}
recall **[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [or
[allocate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} early
[in the space asset]{.underline} **[development lifecycle]{.underline}**
to determine SC risks and their feasibility for NATO. Also, [this
includes involving]{.underline} **[independent]{.underline}**
cybersecurity [**experts** for **up-to-date**]{.underline}
[analyses]{.underline} [on]{.underline} procurement
**[samples]{.underline}**; [[consider]{.mark}ing "**known
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that could be
**exploited**]{.mark} to]{.underline} **[carry out an
attack]{.underline}** or otherwise cause adverse events" (CCSDS, 2019,
p. 12); and subsequently scoring potential vulnerability impacts on NATO
(NIST, 2020a, p. 13). Unal states that "[[any]{.mark} digital
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} [that relies upon]{.underline} near
real-time [information]{.underline} [[is **vulnerable**]{.mark} to
**cyberattacks**]{.underline} \[...\] [In order to **understand the
value** of]{.underline} [each]{.underline} space-dependent
**[capability]{.underline}**, it is important to analyze the
consequences of cyberattacks on each" (Unal, 2019, p. 16). Bridging the
gaps between the diverging areas of SC, cybersecurity and space assets
present a "fascinating opportunity for different states to work
together, because they are providing completely different perspectives,
data and evidence and thus encourage out-of-the-box thinking when
anticipating different types of attacks" (Lister, 2020b). Additionally,
NCIA could further take advantage of collaborative open-source tools
such as the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to promote rapid
"cooperation and information-sharing among allies \[as being\] one of
the most effective defences in cyberspace" (Unal, 2019, p. 26).

2\. Analysis of upstream suppliers, suppliers' sources, and the larger
SC ecosystem:

It is key for NATO to identify and well manage critical space asset
suppliers, which "if disrupted, would create a negative business impact
on the organization" (NIST, 2020b, pp. 8-14). This includes implementing
preliminary review processes and rank suppliers based on their
criticality to NATO, following a supplier criticality score prioritizing
SC risks; and automate supplier risk monitoring and its mitigation.
Firstly, mission-critical systems, assets, data, and processes need to
be identified and prioritized, secondly, those suppliers having access
or providing infrastructure for such capacities. Additionally, supplier
practice assessment protocols should be established, and supplier
self-assessment questionnaires be implemented to determine whether key,
agreed-upon controls and requirements are being met and or improvements
are required. Such steps will enable NATO to "understand how NATO can
partner with developers, suppliers and vendors, maintain cybersecurity
standards and ensure that validity, integrity and availability of the
SASC are secured" (Lister, 2020).

3\. Dedication of specified NATO personnel to effectively assessing and
communicating supplier risks to NATO's executive leadership:

A centralized space asset SASC cyber risk assessment team and
cross-functional SC Risk Councils should be established to proactively
review and mitigate relevant risks (NIST, 2020, pp. 5-8). These teams
should be responsible for providing and enforcing oversight and guidance
on SASC cyber risk assessments and requirements to business units,
approving SC changes such as new suppliers or contract renewals, and
providing joint post-incident analysis and recurring seminars on the
current SASC cyberthreat landscape. Thus, this team would serve as the
central resource for SC threats (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). Such a new task
force would significantly improve SASC risk information sharing and
appropriate resource funding to aggregate all-source information by
public and private partners. It would allow to rapidly address SC
incidents and simplify supplier management below the executive
leadership level. Finally, it would set an increased focus on heightened
SCSRM support for IT service, software, and hardware SCs, pointing out
particular vulnerabilities of each MS's SC.

6.1.5 Train Space Asset CSCRM throughout NATO Exercises

[[NATO should include]{.underline}]{.mark} **[space asset
[CSCRM]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in **every**]{.mark} **NATO
[exercise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [to support NATO's]{.underline}
forward leaning, [**collective defence**]{.underline} approach (Vasen,
2020, pp. 21-23). Such a thorough joint [training would
**enhance**]{.underline}

> "[[allied capacities to **prevent**]{.underline}]{.mark}, defend
> against, [and **recover** from]{.underline}
> [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on space infrastructure. In turn,
> [these]{.underline} activities [[will **demonstrate**]{.mark} **allied
> [resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} to protect and leverage space systems
> [in broader]{.underline} **[transatlantic]{.underline}** security
> **[missions]{.underline}**" (Silverstein, 2020, p. 9).

Measures should include "training for relevant stakeholders'
organization-wide, such as in the departments of SC, \[...\] legal, as
well as key suppliers" (NIST, 2020a, p. 16). Lister pledges to include
therefore relevant private sector suppliers and warns that

> "if the incident response to a cyber SC attack is not rehearsed by
> members of the space community beforehand, it is going to be too late
> to apply lessons learned or respond most efficiently and effectively
> when facing the first major cyber incident. Also, this allows NATO to

Training the individual end user of space assets is key, as a lot of
military staff are frequently redeployed (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). Such
training will help to identify responsible NATO functions, audit
suppliers and incorporate feedback and thus enhance the mutual and clear
understanding of space assets' potential contribution to operations, as
required in AJP-3.2 (CISA, 2020, p. 1).

Furthermore, Heren and Caudill advocate for [[engaging]{.mark} **white
hat [hackers]{.mark}** [to test]{.mark}]{.underline} for possible
[**[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [throughout]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO
[[training]{.underline}]{.mark} (Caudill, 2020).81 [This may
involve]{.underline} issuing **[rewards for hackers]{.underline}** [who
hack a **satellite**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[disclose their
method]{.underline}**. Some other training steps may involve phishing
simulation exercises, mapping upcoming cyber SC threats and priorities,
or tabletop exercises to determine appropriate stakeholders and their
responsibilities throughout incident response. Subsequently, [training
and **test [reports]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[should]{.underline}
[be]{.underline}]{.mark} appropriately [**[shared]{.mark}** not only
[to]{.mark} the military]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunity, [but [as well
the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[commercial [sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Livingstone, 2020). Such collaboration will help to "closely
collaborate with \[...\] key suppliers; include key suppliers in \[...\]
resilience and improvement activities \[and\] assess and monitor
throughout the supplier relationship \[and\] plan for the full
lifecycle" (NIST, 2020b, p. 6).

6.2 Regulation

[The [significant need for]{.mark}]{.underline} [**security
[regulations]{.mark}** [on all]{.mark}]{.underline} space asset
[[segments]{.underline}]{.mark} [is [**aggravated**
by]{.mark}]{.underline} severe [difficulties]{.underline} [in
**resolving [vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} once on-orbit assets
are in space. Highest-level advocacy within NATO is needed to reach
similar sophistication of written guidance for space as it exists for
Air, Land, Sea and Cyber (Vasen, 2020, pp. 22-23). Hence, [NATO should
adopt]{.underline} [a **[comprehensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} regulatory
and **[standardization [framework]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for
its]{.underline} [SASC suppliers]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
[[should include]{.underline}]{.mark} [**mandatory [reports]{.mark}**
[of all]{.mark}]{.underline} space asset cyber
[[breaches]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and **guidance**]{.underline} on
prioritization [and **determination** of]{.underline} [critical
**components**]{.underline} and responsibilities (Akoto, 2020, p. 7).
Aim should be to substitute the principle of Security by Obscurity by a
principle of Security by Design and Default both for technology and SCs,
turning NATO into a cybersecurity-aware, constantly learning
organization, analysing but not punishing incidences and celebrating
good and best practices.

6.2.1 Streamline Data Standardization and Classification Levels

NATO MS should discuss "how national capabilities can work together with
others, how they can provide national ISR for the common good and share
that information with other MS" (Hill, 2020). Silverstein states that

> "[many]{.underline} **[NATO members]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
> [**undeniably proficient** in space]{.underline} technology [and can
> contribute]{.underline} [to]{.underline} sharing
> [agreements]{.underline} **[\[on\] unique data]{.underline}**
> [and]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also
> **[build]{.underline}** beneficial **[redundant layers]{.underline}**
> within the NATO space ecosystem. These redundancies help bridge the
> gap between growing military reliance on satellites and the inherent
> fragility of space objects" (Silverstein, 2020, p. 7).

Wells points to standardized encryption of all data throughout the NATO
SASC having to become obligatory, as "one has always to operate under
the assumption that somebody tapped in" (Wells & Sielaff, 2020).
However, as suggested by Falco (2020), not all systems and organizations
may be able to afford the processing around this, especially when
considering legacy systems. Thus, it is important to consider the
prioritization of risk mitigation techniques, encryption being included.
Furthermore, Vasen suggests introducing formatting standardization
throughout NATO's cyber SASC, such as through following specific
frequencies for SATCOM or software, or streamlining data formatting such
as for timing. This will simplify the integration of given data within
NATO's processing systems. Such formatting standardization should be
continuously undertaken by each MS before forwarding data to NATO, to
decomplicate its later use.

Additionally, **[[classification]{.mark} levels]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} key [members]{.underline} in the commercial sector
[[should be **streamlined**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to **reduce
"barriers**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to sharing]{.underline} space
[systems]{.underline} [and data]{.underline}" (Silverstein, 2020, p. 5).
Therefore, [NATO [should invest in **unified**]{.mark}]{.underline}
secure **[[platforms]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for exchanging
information]{.underline} with suppliers, [[allowing]{.underline} [them
to involve]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[military
end-user]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[in the
**[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and production supply chain [to
give **immediate feedback**]{.underline}. As an example, the US Office
of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) currently aims to
declassify information such as through one-time read-ins for permitted
SC members, influencing supplier conduct through contractual security
requirements. [Such **streamlining** may
**[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} [military **[stove-pipe
thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline} through allowing for

> "agile acquisition processes capable of absorbing innovative
> capabilities, commercial and military \[,\] more flexible, agile and
> resilient \[...\] acquisition processes and faster command and control
> constructs to maintain the advantage in any conflict" (US Space Force
> & US Air Force, 2020, p. 8).

Finally, as stated by Yingst, streamlined "vetting of staff to avoid
insider threats is critical to provide security and trust, whether it's
the service provider or those who are providing assets, hardware or
software to the space infrastructure or the operators of the space
infrastructure" (Yingst, 2020). Sielaff states that employees need to
undergo stricter clearances and have a good operational understanding of
interacting with commercial representatives and users. Thus, CCSDS
suggests developing an enterprise security plan, which is an

> "assurance that any shared resources (e.g., organizational processes,
> networks, and physical facilities) are adequate for the highest
> criticality and sensitivity handled \[... which\] should take into
> account regulatory authority, trust relationships, supply chain, and
> line management authority" (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16).

6.2.2 Enhance Procurement Contract Requirements

[A **[standardized]{.mark}** security]{.underline}
**[[framework]{.underline}]{.mark}** for SASC cybersecurity should be
[[created for]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO [**[procurement]{.mark}
processes** to enhance]{.underline} contract [requirements]{.underline}.
As stated by Falco, "[we need to move **forward**]{.underline} [and
**[increase accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of
manufacturers]{.underline} [and]{.underline} space asset [component
**developers** for software and **any other part** of the
SC]{.underline}" (Falco, 2020). [This includes]{.underline}
**[[streamlin]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** working
[[terminology]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[external and internal
assessments]{.underline}**, [incident
**[reporting]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[communications]{.underline} [across]{.underline} all
[partners]{.underline} and entities, as "there seems to be a lack of
organised structure as far as regulation within the community" (Lister,
2020). Thereby, Timm states that "when you look at the actual SC
cybersecurity itself, everything comes to play through a contract. You
have to install controls in the contracts down the SC, to increase
responsibility and knowledge about adverse effects" (Bander et al.,
2020).

Hence, [NATO should]{.underline}, at a strategic level, further focus on
**[[enhanc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [its **supplier
contracts**]{.underline} [to allow for]{.underline} [more
**security**]{.underline}, **[[integrity]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and]{.underline} quality of [data]{.underline} delivered (CISA, 2020,
p. 1). [This should be done through]{.underline} integrating or
partially **[adopting industry standards]{.underline}** and procedures,
[to provide for an]{.underline} **[understandable]{.underline}** and
[manageable]{.underline} [structure]{.underline} of the SASC. Within
NATO, Standardization Agreements (STANAG) or NATO Standardization
Recommendations (STANREC) might be used as cover agreements. This would
reduce disaggregated, smaller space asset contract series to a
centralized industry procurement framework (Waterman, 2020, pp. 1-6).
Thereby, as suggested by US Space Force and US Air Force, through
creating "a single-entry point for all SATCOM requirements, enterprise
SATCOM needs can be acquired in a deliberate and efficient manner,
avoiding the stovepipes of the past \[...\] using multi-year,
pooled-resource contracts when possible" (US Space Force & US Air Force,
2020, p. 8). Finally, such an approach will simplify senior leadership's
oversight through a common playbook, single incident-handling processes,
and will prevent duplications to the greatest possible extent.
Appropriate regulation enhancement measures include:

> 1\. Adopting a standards-oriented, streamlined supplier risk approach
> to SASC cyber risk assessment processes;
>
> 2\. Incorporating strengthened insurances, such as for data
> confidentiality, into negotiations with suppliers;
>
> 3\. Better monitoring progress, incidents and operations via customer
> and supplier assessments to determine SASC cyber risk assessment
> maturity.

However, [NATO should]{.underline} as well [**[ensure]{.mark}** "that
**commercial** [contracts]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[meet mil]{.mark}itary
[protection]{.mark}** standards]{.underline}, [in order [to
**mitigate**]{.mark} **the [risk]{.mark}** [posed
by]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[the]{.underline} [[military's]{.mark}
use of **[commercial]{.mark}**]{.underline} space
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Unal, 2019, p. 26). Commercial
[standards]{.underline} [**complying** to those
requirements]{.underline}, which [could be **partially or completely**
adopted by]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}, exist and are well-trusted
(Wells & Sielaff, 2020).

### Solvency\-\--U.S-NATO Key

#### Cooperation between [U.S]{.underline} and [NATO]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to [robust]{.underline} space policy.

of the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology in the Foreign
Policy program at Brookings Institution and served at the U.S.

HBisevac)

At the end of the day, [[NATO's]{.mark} **ultimate
[effectiveness]{.mark}** in]{.underline} outer [space will [depend
on]{.mark} its **[cooperation]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the alliance's
**most important** space power]{.underline}: [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. To
date, [[U.S.]{.mark} leadership has been the [key driver of]{.mark}
[NATO]{.mark} [decisionmaking]{.mark} [on]{.mark}]{.underline} outer
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}, and senior U.S. officials have actively
engaged the alliance leadership. For example, in October 2019, General
John Raymond, commander of U.S. Space Command and chief of space
operations, briefed the NATO Military Committee on outer space security
issues. These types of senior-level engagements between U.S. political
and military leaders should continue and be expanded. In addition to
senior-level engagements, there are a number of other actions
[[NATO]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [could take to improve **cooperation** and
**coordination**]{.underline}. Specifically, they [[should]{.mark}
[establish]{.mark} **clear [consultative mechanisms]{.mark}** between
NATO]{.underline}, [U.S. Space Command]{.underline}, [and the U.S. Space
Force]{.underline}. One relatively easy step that could be taken quickly
would be to establish a NATO liaison officer at U.S. Space Command
and/or U.S. Space Force headquarters. Indeed, a number of allied
officers are currently attached as liaisons at several U.S. combatant
commands like U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM).

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also seek to [[incorporate]{.mark}
**[NATO]{.mark} representatives** [in]{.mark}to its]{.underline} outer
[**[space]{.mark}**-related **[wargames]{.mark}**]{.underline} where
possible, especially the Schriever Wargame, the premier U.S. space
wargame. According to a U.S. Air Force press release, several allies
including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, and Japan, have participated in previous Schriever Wargames.
The United States should invite NATO political and military officials to
participate in the next Schriever Wargame.

COOPERATE WITH THE EU

[[NATO]{.mark} [should]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[explore]{.mark} ways
to [coop]{.mark}erate [with]{.mark} the **[EU]{.mark}** on outer
space]{.underline}, primarily [because the [EU]{.mark} has
[developed]{.mark} and deployed the **[Galileo]{.mark}** global
navigation **satellite [system]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} like the U.S. Global Position System (GPS),
[provides accurate **positioning** and **timing**
**info**]{.underline}rmation. In particular, [Galileo [includes]{.mark}
a capability known as the **[P]{.mark}**ublic **[R]{.mark}**egulated
**[S]{.mark}**ervice]{.underline} (PRS), [an encrypted navigation
service for governmental authorized users and sensitive applications
that require **high continuity**]{.underline}. In a crisis situation,
[[PRS]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} **[important
redundancy]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} an adversary's attempt to
**[jam]{.mark}**]{.underline} or destroy **[GPS]{.underline}**. While
many members of NATO are also members of the EU and have access to PRS,
non-EU NATO members, and NATO as an organization, currently does not.
Therefore, [NATO should begin consultations with the EU
about]{.underline} the possibility of [**gaining access** to
PRS]{.underline} for the alliance.

DON'T FORGET DIPLOMACY

Military solutions alone will not allow the United States and its allies
to address the increasing anti-satellite threat. While I have generally
supported many of the Trump administration's space security initiatives
like the re-establishment of U.S. Space Command, a key element missing
from the Trump administration's outer space security strategy has been
the complete lack of a diplomatic component. Without a more
comprehensive strategy that includes a strong diplomatic element, it
will make it difficult for NATO to maintain enough political cohesion to
pursue effective military policies. These tensions were highlighted in a
recent article that noted: "With the exception of France and the United
Kingdom, many Europeans countries are deeply uncomfortable with, or down
right opposed to, the development and use of weapons in space."

This is not a problem unique to outer space. Throughout its history,
there has been constant tension within NATO over the appropriate balance
between defense and diplomacy in its strategy. Since the late 1960s,
with the approval of the Harmel Report, named after former Belgian
foreign minister Pierre Harmel, NATO has sought to more effectively
balance some of the inherent tensions between defense and diplomacy. One
of the key findings from the Harmel Report was that "military security
and a policy of détente are not contradictory but complementary." Arms
control was considered an essential element of this strategy. The
general Harmel Report approach has shaped the key strategic decisions
that the alliance has taken over the past 50 years, most notably the
"Double-Track" decision in 1979 to deploy intermediate-range nuclear
forces in Western Europe, while simultaneously engaging the Soviet Union
in arms control negotiations.

As part of its overall strategy for outer space, NATO should develop
options and recommendations on how it can advance diplomatic solutions
to address the emerging threat to outer space systems. In particular,
NATO should task the Arms Control and Disarmament Committee to examine
what role the alliance could play in developing norms of behavior to
encourage responsible use of outer space. And even though the Trump
administration has generally been opposed to arms control, it has
expressed openness to the development of norms for outer space. In an
recent speech, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Ford stated: "We
clearly need to do more to develop non-legally--binding international
norms of responsible behavior that are complementary to the existing
legal regime."

U.S. LEADERSHIP WILL BE KEY

[[With]{.mark} the **[increasing role]{.mark}** that]{.underline} outer
[[space]{.mark} [is playing]{.mark} in **military
operations**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the **[rise]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the **[anti-sat]{.mark}ellite
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, NATO was correct in its decision to
declare space as an operational domain in December 2019. The question
now is whether the alliance will be able to translate this broad
political guidance into an effective strategy.

An [effective NATO strategy for]{.underline} outer [space will depend on
the ability of the alliance to **build consensus** on the
threat]{.underline}; **[mainstream]{.underline}** outer [space into
NATO's political and military institutions]{.underline}; [find ways to
**cooperate** with the EU]{.underline}; [and **incorporate
diplomacy**]{.underline} into that strategy. But at the end of the day,
[all of this [will]{.mark} **[require]{.mark}**
[clear]{.mark}]{.underline}, [sustained]{.underline}, and consistent
**[[U.S. leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Elevated threat risk to U.S. space systems

Over the past two decades, **[multiple threats]{.underline}** [have
**emerged**]{.underline} to U.S. space systems. [**China and Russia**
have]{.underline} [made]{.underline} **[strategic choices]{.underline}**
[to develop their **spacepower**]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline}, [to include]{.underline} conducting live
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
test**[s]{.underline}** [in space]{.underline} and building
[capabilities that can **damage**]{.underline} or destroy [U.S. space
assets]{.underline}. According to former Secretary of Defense, Mark
Esper, "[China and Russia]{.underline} [are **weaponizing**]{.underline}
[space]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the development of
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
missile**[s]{.underline}**, directed energy weapons, and more, all
**[designed to hold]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
allied]{.underline} space [systems **at risk**]{.underline}. They have
turned a once peaceful arena into a warfighting domain."14 Space access
and space denial are critical components of Chinese and Russian national
and military strategies.15 Both [China and Russia]{.underline}
**[perceive]{.underline}** space [systems as]{.underline} **[viable
targets]{.underline}** [to **nullify**]{.underline} [U.S. **asymmetric
advantages**]{.underline} in other domains [and gain a **strategic
foothold**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} future [**competition**
or]{.underline} [counter]{.underline} a [possible U.S.
**intervention**]{.underline} [during a **regional military
conflict**]{.underline}.16

**[China]{.underline}** has a robust network of space surveillance
sensors capable of searching, tracking, and characterizing satellites in
all Earth orbits. It [is]{.underline} also [developing]{.underline}
**[electronic warfare]{.underline}**, **[cyberthreat]{.underline}**
capabilitie[s]{.underline}, **[sophisticated]{.underline}** on-orbit
[capabilities]{.underline}, kinetic energy weapons (such as ground-based
anti-satellite weapons), and possibly directed energy weapons in
addition to other counterspace technologies.17 China also has an
unmanned, reusable space plane program.18

China began its ASAT tests in 2005 and in 2007 destroyed a satellite in
orbit that created significant space debris in low Earth orbit. Since
then, it has conducted more than a dozen additional tests, including
some in higher orbit, [demonstrating]{.underline} [the **possibility**
of placing]{.underline} most U.S. **[satellites at risk]{.underline}**.
It has fired lasers at satellites and has five military bases capable of
firing light to blind or destroy satellite optics. It also has
incorporated cyberattack plans.19

For the past three years, China has fired more rockets into space than
any other country and has had the most aggressive programs for other
military and scientific efforts in space.20 As it develops the
capability to destroy the U.S. Global Positioning System, it has
constructed for itself a super-secure network of satellites and
controllers for global communications, in addition to a 35-satellite
highly precise navigation system. Despite the fact that China officially
advocates for the peaceful use of space and pursues agreements on the
non-weaponization of space, Beijing continues to improve its
counterspace weapons capabilities and ability to fight wars in and
through space.21

As part of its modernization efforts, **[Russia]{.underline}** is
[**expanding** its space capability by **investing
significantly**]{.underline} [in a full range]{.underline} of
capabilities, [to include]{.underline} ASAT **[kinetic
weapons]{.underline}**, lasers, jammers, [and **cyber**
weapons]{.underline}.22 Early in 2020, the commander of U.S. Space
Command commander, General Jay Raymond, highlighted the concerning
behavior of two new Russian satellites with distinct similarities to
other Russian satellites that launched a high-speed projectile in
2017.23 Russia continued its ASAT development activities in 2019 and
2020.24

[Another aspect]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [**threat profile** is
the U.S. **reliance on cyberspace**]{.underline} and the electromagnetic
spectrum. **[China]{.underline}**, **[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, [and
**Iran**]{.underline} [are **honing** their]{.underline} [cyber assault
skills]{.underline} [and putting]{.underline} [them]{.underline} [into
**practice**]{.underline}.25 [A cyberattack]{.underline} on space
systems [can result in **data loss**]{.underline},
[widespread]{.underline} **[disruptions]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} even **[permanent loss]{.underline}** [of a
satellite]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[system
shutdown]{.underline}**. [Denial of service]{.underline} or loss of
system performance [can mean **denial**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
[loss of **capability**]{.underline}, [which means]{.underline} such
[attacks have]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[same
impact]{.underline}** [as a **kinetic assault**]{.underline} on defense
and economic assets that rely on digital systems.

Space systems, which are part of the information network that relies
entirely on digital systems and data flow and on software and
radio-frequency links, are especially vulnerable to electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) attacks. An EMP might create havoc not only on Earth, but
also within satellite systems. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has a **variety of
systems**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
**[Nuclear]{.underline}** **[C]{.underline}**ommand
**[and]{.underline}** **[C]{.underline}**ontrol [and missile
warning]{.underline} capabilities, [whose **survival**]{.underline},
[despite]{.underline} significant [technical]{.underline} [survivability
enhancements]{.underline}, [might be **challenged**]{.underline} by a
nuclear detonation in space.26 [The threat of a
**cyber-attack**]{.underline} on U.S. space assets [is **being viewed**
as the]{.underline} **[likely form of attack]{.underline}**, at least
[in the **near term**]{.underline}.27

Today, a [[variety]{.mark} of [space assets provide]{.mark}

terrestrial and]{.underline} outer-[[space]{.mark} contexts]{.underline}
in which these systems operate [are [changing]{.mark} **[more]{.mark}
rapidly today** than at any previous point]{.underline}. The
[[dynamics]{.mark} of use]{.underline}, the [[geopolitical]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
[[threat]{.mark} profile]{.underline}, [and the [innate]{.mark}

[**[surpassed]{.mark}** [what]{.mark} the current [structures]{.mark}
were **[designed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[handle]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and this has been acknowledged by senior leadership on both sides of the
Atlantic.

Perhaps the [[most]{.mark} dramatic contextual
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} from the era which produced the current
mechanisms of space cooperation [is the recent **diversification** of
space **actors** and **applications**]{.underline}. [[Space]{.mark} has
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[democratized]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
[with numerous companies]{.underline}, [governments]{.underline}, [and
others using space to a **degree** **never seen before**]{.underline}.
Investment in privately owned space assets has grown tremendously in the
last five years, with companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, Planet, Rocket
Lab, Amazon, Orbital Insight, and others planning thousands of new
satellites, launch vehicles, ground systems, and data-analytics
offerings.16 [Commercial industry]{.underline} also [has ambitions in
space exploration]{.underline} (including missions to both the Moon and
Mars) [and space mining]{.underline}, concepts that current mechanisms
failed to consider, [[raising]{.mark} new **legal** and **[sovereignty
questions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These [new actors are
[introducing]{.mark} [new]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies
[and processes]{.underline}---[such as **line
manufacturing**]{.underline}, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning---[that are
**[disrupting]{.mark} [space]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well.
**[Government]{.underline}**-[**sponsored** space activities have
grown]{.underline} just as **[rapidly]{.underline}**, with [nearly
**sixty countries** now operating in space]{.underline}. Just in the
past year, Australia and Saudi Arabia both announced the creation of new
space agencies, the latter committing \$5 billion, a sum almost equal to
the entire budget of ESA.17 A diverse set of countries, from India to
Indonesia to Nigeria to Norway, is investing in new space assets. In the
future, space will be marked not by a scarcity of users and uses, but an
abundance.

This [immense [prolif]{.mark}eration [of]{.mark} assets and
[actors]{.mark} [brings]{.mark}]{.underline} with it a [**new set** of
**[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Space is becoming **more
[crowded]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Over the next few years alone,
[**thousands** of satellites are projected to join]{.underline} the
[approximately **three thousand** currently in
[orbit]{.mark}]{.underline}.18 This [explosion in
spacecraft]{.underline}, and the introduction of hundreds of new,
inexperienced space stakeholders, [**[complicates]{.mark}** the
**management** and **[protection]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} space
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark}
[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}]{.underline} and other space objects
[[reach]{.mark} [end-of-life]{.mark}]{.underline}, [they]{.underline}
often [[become]{.mark} **uncontrolled [space]{.mark}
[debris]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [can]{.mark} destroy or
**[impede]{.mark} [critical]{.mark}
[sat]{.mark}**]{.underline}ellite**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Space
launches]{.underline}, [satellite failures]{.underline}, anti-satellite
([[ASAT]{.underline}]{.mark}) [tests]{.underline}, and other events are
[[adding]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a **growing [sea]{.mark} [of
debris]{.mark}**]{.underline}, pieces of which can stay in orbit for
thousands of years. Today, ESA and USSTRATCOM both track more than
twenty-nine thousand objects in orbit, double the number two decades
ago.19 Concerningly, this number is projected to grow to more than one
hundred thousand over the next decade (see Figure 6).20 This
[[congestion]{.mark} is **increasingly** [causing]{.mark}
**[harm]{.mark}**]{.underline}: an Iridium satellite was destroyed by a
collision with a defunct Russian satellite in 2016; Capella Space
recently reported that one of its satellites narrowly avoided a
catastrophic collision with a piece of space debris; and as noted above,
debris from a 2019 Indian ASAT test now threatens the International
Space Station. 21 Debris interference has even been suspected in the
2019 failure of Intelsat 29e.22

In addition to growing competition for physical space, more
[[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} are [competi]{.mark}ng [for
finite]{.mark}]{.underline} (and crowded) [radio-[frequency]{.mark}
[spectrum]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Space stakeholders express
[growing]{.mark} [concern]{.mark} [about]{.mark} **coordinating
[transmissions]{.mark}** from many thousands of new satellites reliant
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} similar or [[overlapping]{.mark} frequency
[bands]{.mark}]{.underline}, as to avoid jamming signals and degrading
capabilities.23 The advent of 5G is further complicating this issue.
This [coordination is **[no trivial matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the
Department of Defense, the most sophisticated and well-resourced space
actor in the world, inadvertently jams its own satellites dozens of
times a month.24

### UQ\-\--Russia\-\--Attacks

#### Russia [has]{.underline} the intent now to [attack]{.underline} the [West]{.underline}\-\--escalates to [war]{.underline}.

Brandon **Weichert, 21** (Brandon Weichert is a geopolitical analyst who
runs The Weichert Report and is a former Congressional staff member who
holds a Master of Arts in Statecraft & National Security Affairs from
the Institute of World Politics, 11-16-2021, accessed on 6-23-2022, Asia
Times, "Russia threatening space war with US",
<https://asiatimes.com/2021/11/russia-threatening-space-war-with-us/>,
HBisevac) \*\*edited for ableist language\*\*

Last week, US President Joe [Biden's]{.underline} administration
[briefed NATO members about the imminence of a Russia]{.underline}n
invasion of Ukraine. This came after months of increasing tensions
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia over Crimea,
the small peninsula that juts out into the Black Sea from Ukraine, which
Russia annexed in 2014.

Shortly after [these caustic US intelligence warnings to
Europe]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline} test-[fired an]{.underline}
anti-satellite (**[ASAT]{.underline}**) [weapon that created such a
**large debris field** in orbit that the]{.underline} astronauts on the
International Space Station (**[ISS]{.underline}**) were [forced to take
refuge in the SpaceX capsule]{.underline}, in anticipation of having to
abandon the station.

(As an aside, there were Russian cosmonauts on the ISS who were also
forced to take refuge in the Soyuz capsule docked on the Russian side of
the ISS.)

Western media reported the [US intelligence community's]{.underline}
[warning]{.underline} to NATO [about]{.underline} an imminent [Russian
**invasion** of **Ukraine** and Russia's testing of an **ASAT** that
threatened the **ISS** as separate events]{.underline}. [They are **not
separate**]{.underline}.

The US [government has been distracted by the **absurdity** of its
**domestic politics**]{.underline}. [Russian leaders have **sensed
weakness** they seek to **exploit**]{.underline}. The [US
appears]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~ \[**[disoriented]{.underline}**\] [by
**bad leadership** and **internal dissent**]{.underline}. [Now may be
the time for Russia to **strike hard** against the **West** and rewrite
the **European regional order** in its **favor**]{.underline}.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, the United States and its European
allies have consistently articulated their opposition to any further
Russian military actions in Ukraine. Throughout former president Donald
Trump's administration, for example, the United States gave Ukraine's
besieged military much-needed lethal aid to assist in the defense of its
territory from greater Russian aggression.

Various NATO countries have also helped Ukraine enhance its national
defenses while Russia has intensified its commitment to expanding its
threat to Ukraine.

Whether the West would risk direct military confrontation with Russia
over a non-NATO member like Ukraine is another matter entirely. Given
the constant declarations of support for Ukrainian sovereignty, though,
Moscow cannot be certain that the Western alliance would not intervene
if it decided to cleave away more of Ukraine.

Therefore, Moscow has likely initiated plans to neuter any potential
threat of a NATO defense of Ukraine against any Russian invasion by
going after sensitive American and NATO satellites.

The surprise Russian demonstration in orbit was probably an example of
radical deterrence: Moscow is letting Washington, Brussels and London
know just how far it is willing to go to achieve its strategic
objectives in what it views as its "near abroad" (in this case,
Ukraine).

The Kremlin is asking the West if it values the security and economic
prosperity of Ukraine over its own security and prosperity. Moscow is
likely banking on the West saying that, in fact, it does not put its own
interests behind those of Ukraine (it doesn't).

Washington is now in a strategic quandary: Failure to respond with at
least an in-kind demonstration in orbit would lead Moscow's leaders to
conclude that they can have their way with Ukraine. This conclusion
would lead to the inevitable annexation of more of Ukraine by Russia
while reinforcing the claims of both Russia and China that the United
States is a great power in terminal decline.

On the heels of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, given how much
moral and diplomatic capital the West has (~~stupidly~~) invested in
Ukraine, [the failure of **Western powers** to **respond** to this
Russian **provocation** would lead to **greater aggression** directed
against the West]{.underline}, not just in Europe but around the world
-- and [in **space**]{.underline}.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [relies on satellites more
than any other nation]{.underline} on Earth. Not only are satellites key
for modern communications and economic transactions, but they are
critical in modern military operations.

[Satellites form the backbone for]{.underline} the most basic functions
of [America's **global military**]{.underline}. [Removing those **key
satellite interlinks** would render the US military
**impotent**]{.underline}, leaving America and its allies vulnerable to
attack from a predatory power, such as Russia.

In space, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has more to lose than **any other country**]{.underline} -- and the
Kremlin knows this. [That fact explains why Russia began a **rapid**
military **modernization**]{.underline} in 2010 to reorganize its forces
[to better fight]{.underline} -- [and win]{.underline} -- [a space war
against the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

[To deter Russia]{.underline}, the [US must **immediately** test its own
**ASAT capability** while deploying **swarms** of smaller]{.underline},
"bodyguard" [satellites]{.underline} designed [to protect
America's]{.underline} sensitive [satellites]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} Earth [orbit]{.underline} from ASAT attack.

At the same time, Washington must clarify its position on Ukraine:
Either it stands with the embattled country, or it does not. Strategic
ambiguity, in this case, invites greater challenge from Moscow -- which
is most unwelcome currently.

[Failure to draw **red lines** clearly will lead to a **Russian strike**
on **US satellites** that might precipitate a **war**]{.underline}. [Or
worse]{.underline}, [a **US defeat**]{.underline}.

### UQ\-\--Solar Storms

#### Solar storms are [coming now]{.underline}.

"The [solar cycle]{.underline} 25 that [we are entering now
is]{.underline} currently [increasing **very steeply**]{.underline},"
she said. "We do not know if this means that it will be a very tough
solar cycle. It could slow down, and it could become a very weak solar
cycle. But right now, it's **[increasing fast]{.underline}**."

Clean up on low orbit

There's a silver lining to all of this. Sure, operators might lose
billions worth of satellites, but this new and strong Solar Maximum
could help address [a **much worse** problem]{.underline} we've been
having for some time and [which has only gotten **worse** with
time]{.underline}: [**[space
junk]{.underline}**](https://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/spack-junk-10112021/).

NASA is monitoring some of the biggest pieces of debris out there,
including approximately 20,000 objects as big as or bigger than a
baseball and 50,000 objects as big as a marble. Smaller pieces of
debris, however, are virtually undetectable right now, but NASA
estimates [there are **millions** of objects]{.underline} that are 50
microns to 1 millimeter in diameter.

That might not seem like such a big deal but consider that these [tiny
pieces of debris travel at **17,500** **miles per hour**]{.underline}.
[At these velocities]{.underline}, even an [object with a tiny mass can
exert a **powerful kinetic energy** capable of **significant
damage**]{.underline} upon impact. Everyone's seen the
movie Gravity, right?

### Add On\-\--AI

Bogdan explained that Booz Allen Hamilton, along with [a coalition
of]{.underline} commercial **[[AI leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [has
[pioneered a]{.mark}]{.underline} commercial [[technology]{.mark}
platform [designed to]{.mark}]{.underline} [facilitate]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[[accelerate AI adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}** at
scale [[within the federal government]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} enterprise AI [[system]{.underline}]{.mark},
[called]{.underline} **[Modzy]{.underline}**, [[has
significant]{.underline}]{.mark} commercial and **[[military
applications]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"**[[First things]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[you]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[need to know]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[what is going on up there]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[[There are a lot

trying to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[combine space
catalogues]{.underline}** [so they can [have a
single]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[unified data
library]{.underline}]{.mark}** [where everything including adversary
information gets catalogued]{.underline}," Bogdan said.

[[Modzy can]{.underline}]{.mark} [[deliver]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[AI
models]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that assist]{.mark} commanders
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[analyzing vast
datasets]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and enabling them to develop

[make better-informed decisions]{.underline}. These datasets can cover a
wide range of variables to include sensor information, targeting data,
navigational details, threat libraries of enemy weapons and capabilities
and various enemy missile launch and flight trajectory characteristics.
[[Should a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[collective [AI-empowered
system]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[be able to use]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[advanced algorithms]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} combine
and]{.underline} **[[instantly access]{.mark} all of [this]{.mark}
interwoven [information]{.mark}]{.underline}** [critical to
response-time decision making]{.underline}, [[commanders could receive
a]{.underline}]{.mark} life-saving **["fused" or [integrated combat
picture]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"[Threat information has to]{.underline} [be]{.underline} **[tied into
one system]{.underline}**. We need systems to talk to each other, which
only works if they are on a common communications hub. [If you have
multiple systems that are not coordinated]{.underline}, [defending
forces may think they have 12 missiles coming at them even though they
are all looking at the same missile]{.underline}," the MDA official
explained.

[The]{.underline} [more]{.underline} streamlined and
**[accessible]{.underline}** [information is]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [faster]{.underline} **[AI-driven
algorithms]{.underline}** [can compare new data against

to combat information to perform analytics]{.underline}, [solve
problems]{.underline}, [make determinations, draw comparisons
and]{.underline} **[synergize information]{.underline}**.

"[[You are going to need]{.underline}]{.mark} **[strong
analytics]{.underline}** [and you will need to look back at previous
data using **AI and [Machine Learning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [You have
an ability to figure things out quickly because you will have AI going
through all the different possibilities for how to protect
assets]{.underline}. [The loop gets quick and short]{.underline},"
Bogdan explained.

[It makes sense that]{.underline} **[[pooled data access would massively
improve]{.mark} computational [processing
speed]{.mark}]{.underline}**\...

"[[The]{.mark} **[models]{.mark}** and the **algorithms** [you create
for AI are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[only as good as the data you put in
there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It is a matter of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[access to the right pools of data]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[the quality of that data]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Bogdan said.

The United States needs to respond to this technological challenge in
the same way it responded to prior technology competitions, such as the
space race. [[U.S. leadership in AI is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** [not only [because]{.mark}
[technology is a key enabler]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} political, economic, and **[[military

**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[can]{.mark} [shape how AI is used around the

used for incredible good]{.underline} by societies, [it already is being
abused by authoritarian states to surveil and repress their
populations]{.underline}. And [advances in AI technology are enabling

### Add On\-\--Cables

#### Only defense of [space based assets]{.underline} protect allies and stop EMP attacks\-\--those collapse the entire undersea cable network.

[[Space]{.underline}]{.mark}-[[based defenses offer]{.mark}
**[revolutionary advantages]{.mark}** [over existing]{.mark}
**[N]{.mark}**ational **[M]{.mark}**issile
**[D]{.mark}**efenses]{.underline} (NMD), [[that cannot]{.mark}
[protect]{.mark} **U.S. [allies]{.mark}** [or **bases
overseas**]{.mark}]{.underline}, might be hard-pressed to defend the
U.S. mainland against increasingly sophisticated North Korean threats,
[[and]{.mark} [cannot defend]{.mark} the [U.S. from]{.mark} large-scale
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [missile threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} from Russia
or China.

[[Space]{.mark}-based [defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[can
do **all the above**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[SDI]{.underline}]{.mark}-[type defenses can [intercept]{.mark}
[missiles]{.mark} during all phases of flight]{.underline}: boost-phase,
mid-course, and terminal-phase. [Such a [system]{.mark} could [shield
U.S. allies]{.mark} and troops overseas]{.underline}; much better
protect Hawaii, Alaska, and distant U.S. territories; [and could [not as
easily]{.mark} be [attacked]{.mark}]{.underline},
[overwhelmed]{.underline}, [or fooled with decoys]{.underline} as NMD.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} advantageous [characteristics of
space-based defenses [are]{.mark}]{.underline} all the [more
[**important** because of the **existential threat** from
**nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} electromagnetic pulse
(**[[EMP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Even a **single warhead** successfully delivered]{.underline} against
allies overseas or against the United States [could black out an
**entire nation** and kill **millions**]{.underline}.

[Even a single weapon detonated for EMP]{.underline} at mid-course, over
the ocean, [would have catastrophic consequences for the world
economy]{.underline}. Ambassador Henry Cooper warns: "Whether deliberate
or accidental, the [[EMP from]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[high-altitude
explosions]{.mark} could [**disable**]{.mark} the [world's **entire
undersea cable network**]{.mark} that]{.underline} reportedly
[carries]{.underline} about [\$10 trillion of financial transactions in

No technology is as profoundly important to the global economy as the
[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is [[**dependent** on]{.mark} the
[security of]{.mark} a **[vast network]{.mark}**]{.underline} of some
750,000 miles [[of]{.mark} **seabed [cables]{.mark}** that criss-cross
the oceans' depths]{.underline}. The [[interdependence
of]{.underline}]{.mark} global submarine [communication [systems
means]{.mark} that a [break in one cable can have]{.mark} [**cascading
effects** on internet access]{.mark} to **distant states**]{.underline}.
While the rules to protect this critical infrastructure in peacetime
should be refurbished, the need to further develop the rules to secure
this global infrastructure during periods of armed conflict is perhaps
even more compelling. Although several peacetime treaties protect
submarine cables from disruption and criminal acts, albeit weakly, the
rules that apply during naval war are even more antiquated. Because the
law of naval warfare is principally based on custom and state practice
rather than treaties, there is considerable uncertainty over how
submarine cables would fare in conflict at sea.

In February, Gen. Jay Raymond, the new chief of space operations and the
head of U.S. Space Command, publicly stated that two Russian spacecraft
were tailing a U.S. satellite. He said that Russia's behavior was
"highly unusual and disturbing." On April 15, U.S. Space Command
announced that Russia tested an anti-satellite weapon. [[Russia]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [China]{.mark} both [recognize]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
[American]{.mark} high-precision [warfighting]{.mark} is
**[dependent]{.mark}** [on **space systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to the U.S. director of national intelligence, [[both]{.mark}
Russia and China are developing [capabilities to **destroy**]{.mark}
**[U.S.]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}** in all orbital
regimes]{.underline} --- at all altitudes. But, unlike in the past, the
United States is not on its own. It has allies and partners to turn to.

During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union were the two
dominant space powers and both worked diligently to develop space
weapons. European allies, France in particular, decried efforts to
create anti-satellite systems. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the number of spacefaring nations has markedly increased. And, as the
world has become more dependent on space systems, attitudes about space
security have changed. The United States has demonstrated its commitment
to space security through the revival of U.S. Space Command and the
establishment of the U.S. Space Force. Other countries have, too. France
and Japan, for example, have announced the creation of their own
military space commands. NATO has declared that space is an operational
domain. Now, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has allies
who are eager to create a more robust network for **monitoring adversary
activity** on orbit and to establish a **unified space doctrine** to
achieve a **resilient** space security **framework**.]{.underline}
[[Washington]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [build]{.mark} a

war]{.mark}]{.underline} that extends [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}to [outer
[space]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[should]{.mark} **[leverage]{.mark}** its [allies]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[build]{.mark} a [more]{.mark} **[robust]{.mark} [network]{.mark}** [to
**monitor**]{.mark} and track activities in [space]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While doing so, [Washington [should]{.mark} [lead]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} and the world [[to **develop
norms**]{.mark} and practices [that]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}
**[destabilizing]{.mark} [military]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}** [in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Cold War

During the Cold War, the United States included allies in its national
security space activities but only on a limited basis. America's focus
was on reconnaissance satellites, which were a closely held secret. The
U.S. government did not even acknowledge the existence of the National
Reconnaissance Office until 1992. Space reconnaissance activities were
not publicly discussed in any detail. Cooperation in this sensitive area
of U.S. space activity primarily involved the limited sharing of
space-derived intelligence with select allies. Only the heads of NATO
members were briefed on the existence of intelligence satellites. Beyond
those heads of states, only the British had privileged access to
American space capabilities. The United States shared raw images from
imagery satellites with the United Kingdom as far back as the 1960s.

The importance of space systems did not reduce allies' concerns about
the weaponization of space, even when the Soviet threat became more
pronounced. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union possessed a co-orbital
anti-satellite weapon --- a satellite designed to maneuver next to its
target on orbit and destroy it --- called Istrebitel' sputnikov or
"satellite killer." The United States promptly responded to the threat.
In 1976, then-CIA director George H.W. Bush sent a memorandum to the
national security advisor, stating that the United States needed to
re-evaluate the vulnerability of its overhead reconnaissance systems.
Beginning in 1977, the United States reinvigorated its efforts to
develop an operational anti-satellite capability.

In the late 1960s, the British had launched the Skynet-series
communication satellites that provided secure communications across the
European theater; the system is located in geosynchronous orbit ---
22,236 miles from Earth. London was primarily concerned with
discouraging the United States and Soviet Union from developing
anti-satellite weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit. The
British worried that, if the United States developed anti-satellite
weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit, the Soviet Union would
follow suit and threaten Skynet. The British did, however, support the
United States in matching the existing Soviet anti-satellite capability.

Most European allies were, however, overtly critical --- or lukewarm at
best --- about America's efforts to develop an anti-satellite weapon.
The French, in particular, were especially critical and called upon the
United States and Soviet Union to prevent an arms race in space and
implement arms control for anti-satellite weapons. Even as the allies
began building their own space capabilities, they were not supportive of
U.S. efforts to respond militarily to the Soviet space threat. Many NATO
members were not fully aware of how dependent the alliance had become on
information derived from space systems. Washington had grown accustomed
to pursuing national security activities in space under a shroud of
secrecy with minimal allied consultation. The Cold War legacy of U.S.
dominance and secrecy has left many in the space community with the
mistaken belief that the United States should again go it alone.

Ready Allies

In the post-Cold War era, [the [space]{.mark} [environment]{.mark} has
**[markedly changed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There has been a
[proliferation of]{.underline} both American and foreign **[commercial
space capabilities]{.underline}**, an [expansion of the **number** of
**spacefaring nations**]{.underline}, a [greater **reliance** on space
systems]{.underline} by not just the United States but also its allies,
[and a significant growth in]{.underline} the [**number** and
**sophistication** of **threat actors** in space]{.underline}. While the
United States, China, and Russia are certainly the most capable
spacefaring nations, [Washington's [allies]{.mark} [have much]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [offer]{.mark} [to create **greater resiliency** for
space]{.mark} systems]{.underline} and to win a war that extends into
outer space. [[As]{.mark} the [threats expand]{.mark}, U.S.
[cooperation]{.mark} with allies [ought to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} as
well]{.underline}. Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has emphasized the necessity of expanding allied
relationships in the space arena. Unlike during the Cold War, [American
allies are **willing** and **eager** to collaborate with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

For example, last year, [[NATO]{.mark} [declared]{.mark} [space]{.mark}
an [operational domain]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, this
announcement [should be **followed** up with
**doctrine**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2019, the U.K. Ministry of Defense
published a document entitled "Towards a Defense Space Strategy." The
British government is intent on creating a cadre of space experts that
can ensure the security of U.K. and allied national security space
systems. Britain's focus is on space-related training and collaboration
with capable spacefaring allies.

Moreover, the United States already cooperates with Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany at U.S. Space
Command's Combined Space Operations Center located at Vandenberg Air
Force Base. Additionally, allies participate in the Schriever Wargames
that examine "critical space and cyberspace issues in depth."

Today, unlike during the Cold War, U.S. allies are more aware of the
threats to space systems. The United Kingdom has made it very clear that
it views space as a warfighting domain. [[America's spacefaring]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [can [serve]{.mark} as an
[important resource for ensuring]{.mark} **continued [U.S. space
dominance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Leveraging Allies

Current allied involvement is a good start, but [[more can be
done]{.mark} to **prepare** for **war** extending into outer
space]{.underline} --- particularly [in two areas:]{.underline} [1)
**s**pace **s**ituational **a**wareness]{.underline}, now more commonly
called space domain awareness; [and 2) establishing **space-behavior
norms**]{.underline}.

In January of this year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced
his country's establishment of a Space Domain Mission Unit.
Additionally, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a stated goal
of providing high-quality space domain awareness and of "maintaining
four information-gathering satellite systems." While the unit will be
located at Fuchu Air Base and use a radar "capable of monitoring space
systems up to an altitude of 5,800 kilometers \[3,600 miles\]," the
Japanese Ministry of Defense "will share information collected by the
facility with U.S. forces." Japan is providing a replicable model for
other spacefaring nations.

[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} can [make a [particularly valuable]{.mark}
contribution to space security [in]{.mark} the realm of **[space domain
awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As an [increasingly [diverse]{.mark}
[set of sensors]{.mark} are [integrated]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} space [domain]{.mark} awareness resources]{.underline}, a
[[more]{.mark} [accurate picture of **adversary activity**]{.mark} in
space can be achieved]{.underline}. Fundamentally, to obtain better
space domain awareness, terrestrial real estate matters. More
ground-tracking stations allow the United States and its allies to
better track threats on orbit. By using radar and optical systems spread
out all over the Earth, it is possible to have much better coverage of
potential threats in space. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can also work with allies who do not have any
space capabilities to install **optical telescopes** and **radar
systems** that can create a more robust and **global network** for
**monitoring space threats**]{.underline}. Spacefaring allies, even in
the most nascent stage of development, can play an invaluable role in
this mission.

In early 2020, French President Emanuel Macron announced his country's
establishment of a space command that will be placed under the French
Air Force. According to reports by the French Ministry of Defense, the
French space command will develop a modified version of its Syracuse
satellites that can observe threats on orbit and use on-board weapons to
engage them if necessary. Even if France decides not to arm its
satellites in the near term, its Syracuse system will have strong
potential for expanding allied space domain awareness in space.

Though London has promised to present a formal U.K. space defense
strategy, one has not yet materialized. During the Cold War, Britain was
the only European ally that provided political support for America's
efforts to develop space weapons. Up until very recently, however,
Britain has been largely silent on space security issues. Last year,
then Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said the United Kingdom would
remain at the forefront of the space domain. London is investing more in
space intelligence capabilities, but it is not keeping pace with the
threats from more sophisticated states.

Smaller allied countries might have limited but highly specialized
services to offer a space coalition. Estonia, for example, has a
reputation for high-tech innovation, especially in cyber security and
digital services. Estonia has established its Space Office, which is
working with universities and start-ups to develop a broad spectrum of
satellites, especially micro-satellites. U.S. investment in countries
like Estonia can help create space innovation eco-systems that can
contribute to the overall resiliency of allied military space activity.

The integration of allied and international commercial space domain
awareness and satellite systems is a necessary task, but there are
substantial obstacles to overcome in the process. A RAND report stated
that "U.S.-European military space activities suffer a plight equal if
not worse than the slate of more traditional interoperability issues
that arise among NATO allies." [[As more countries contribute]{.mark} to
space domain awareness]{.underline}, [**[uniformity]{.mark}** [of
data]{.mark} types will be of even **[greater
importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many allied space programs are in a
**nascent** stage]{.underline} and their potential has not been fully
realized. [[Washington]{.mark} [should]{.mark} actively encourage and
[work]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} European [[partners]{.mark} in
their [efforts to develop more capable]{.mark} space
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} European
[[allies develop]{.mark} [more sophisticated]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark} for monitoring]{.underline} the space environment,
[[Washington]{.mark} [should push for]{.mark} interoperable systems that
enable the [**seamless sharing** of data across
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The United States should work with European partners to develop a
framework for monitoring and reacting to adversary threat activity such
as a joint architecture for processing data from the many different
allied space domain awareness sensors. [A unified doctrine would focus
on measures that enable foreign government and commercial systems to
augment any loss of U.S. capability due to an attack]{.underline}. There
are, however, potential legal obstacles and data-compatibility issues
that will likely prevent the realization of an effective unified
doctrine in the near term. Most importantly, [Washington should work
with its spacefaring allies to develop comprehensive plans for reacting
to an attack on an allied space asset]{.underline}. However, a military
response does not have to include an attack on an adversary space
system. The fundamental need is having the ability to respond quickly
and in a unified manner to any space attack. An integrated diplomatic
response should be created for space crises as well.

Establishing Norms in Space

During the Cold War, the United States refused to establish public
policies regarding threats to space systems. The State Department and
Intelligence Community consistently advised the White House not to even
publicly provide a definition of outer space. Refraining from
establishing specific and clearly articulated policies is no longer an
option in the post-Cold War era.

[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and potential allies --- [[can
assist]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[in **establishing**]{.mark} [**norms**
in space]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Paris moves ahead with deploying
on-orbit weapons, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [[and]{.mark} all other **[NATO]{.mark}**
**members** [should work]{.mark}]{.underline} with France [[to develop
**specific rules of engagement** for]{.mark} the use of **[space
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fundamentally, France is making it clear
that Washington has a potential partner in a space war that is willing
to use offensive weapons. It is essential, however, to ensure that there
is an agreed-upon framework for using French offensive capabilities to
respond to an attack against an allied system. Additionally, Washington
should strongly urge Paris not to test any weapon systems against
objects in space. Such testing could create debris that is a threat to
other satellites and could encourage Russia and China to follow up with
similar tests.

Because of greater access to space technology, the number of spacefaring
nations will continue to grow while there will be an increase in the
number of state actors that possess space weapons. The 2019 Indian
anti-satellite weapon demonstration is a case in point. Iran, for
another example, could construct a crude anti-satellite weapon in the
near term. Therefore, it is imperative for the United States to work
with Israel --- the most capable spacefaring nation in the Middle East
--- in monitoring and deterring Tehran from entering the space weapons
arena.

[[Russia's]{.mark} recent [a]{.mark}nti-[sat]{.mark}ellite
[weapon]{.mark} [test]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [tailing]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
a U.S. [satellite]{.mark}]{.underline}, and previous U.S. State
Department statements about Moscow's destabilizing behavior
[[highlight]{.mark} the [**lack** of **established norms**]{.mark} for
military space operations]{.underline}. For example, how close is too
close for a satellite? Clearly, establishing a code of conduct in space
is something that the United States cannot do on its own. [It should be
a **joint effort** with spacefaring allies around the
globe]{.underline}. Additionally, it is imperative that America and its
allies publicly confront Russia, in particular, about its dangerous
behavior in space.

Russia, China, and the United States are especially concerned about
rendezvous and proximity operations such as maneuvering close to another
space object. If a country conducts rendezvous and proximity operations
without providing any warning or explanation, the action could be
treated as a hostile military act. Just as an uncoordinated approach by
a foreign vessel to a U.S. Navy ship would be treated as an aggressive
act, so too should similar maneuvers that involve American and allied
spacecraft. Therefore, [it is [vital for Washington to work]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [to establish]{.mark} [what]{.mark}
specific **[space behaviors]{.mark}** [will be considered]{.mark}
**[unacceptable]{.mark}** [and to]{.mark} **communicate**]{.underline}
--- [and **[enforce]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[such standards]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} aggressive spacefaring nations like [Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [should]{.mark} work collectively to
[prevent]{.mark} the [testing of weapons in space]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [**[debris]{.mark}** [generated]{.mark} from these tests
[poses]{.mark} a [**threat** to]{.mark} the
**[satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline} of all spacefaring nations. [If
more nations begin testing anti-satellite weapons]{.underline},
[[military space systems]{.mark} could be [inadvertently
damaged]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This [situation]{.mark} could [lead
to]{.mark} an [overall **escalation** in **preexisting
tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies providing
a **clearly defined code of conduct** for national security space
activities is a **feasible** and **necessary step** to take in the
immediate term]{.underline}.

Stronger Together

Certainly, though no one wants a war to begin in or extend into outer
space, ignoring this possibility would be extremely negligent. The
United States possesses highly sophisticated national security space
systems that will be a prime target for capable spacefaring adversaries
if a conflict should arise. In the past, the United States has presumed
it can and will fight alone in space --- but that is no longer
necessary. [[Washington can better ensure]{.mark} its **[dominance in
space]{.mark}** [if it]{.mark} more [fully **embraces**]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Washington would be wise to build a coalition that creates a more
robust system for monitoring the space domain]{.underline}, [reacting to
space threats]{.underline}, [and prevailing in a war that extends into
outer space]{.underline}. Building a space coalition --- especially one
that includes allies from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia --- is no
simple task. But, working towards systems integration and also a common
space doctrine is positive step forward towards increased resiliency of
the space systems that are essential for precision warfighting. Of
course, technical systems cannot be the only focus of the coalition; it
should also devote attention to the development of norms for military
space activity.

Hyten has stated that "**[[trying to fight alone in space would be a
mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}**" --- [a mistake that we cannot afford to
make]{.underline}.

[We live in "a time of]{.underline} **[profound
transformations]{.underline}** [to our global context]{.underline},"
stressed Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World
Economic Forum, during the presentation of the Global Risks Report
2015,4 in Davos, Switzerland. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} him, mankind
faces the accelerated effects of climate change and the increasing
uncertainty about the global geopolitical context. Going further, the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board, in a
recent analysis, pointed out that " in 2015, [unchecked **climate
change**, global]{.underline} [**nuc**lear weapons **mod**ernization,
and out-sized]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
**[arsenals]{.underline}** [pose]{.underline} extraordinary and
**[undeniable [threats to]{.mark} the continued [existence]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline}**."5 That led its Doomsday Clock to be advanced by
two minutes. Today it marks three minutes to midnight, the moment of the
Earth\'s collapse.

There are many other reports and studies alerting to this catastrophe.
Such an immeasurable disaster on Earth may affect all space activities,
and their legal achievements. [While]{.underline}
**[focusing]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} **[outer
space]{.underline}** and space activities, [international space law can
be considered not only a probable]{.underline} **[victim]{.underline}**
[of this disaster, but also]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [**important
instrument capable of preventing it**. [The]{.mark}]{.underline}
fundamental 1967 **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty,6 as
its Preamble points out, [is inspired " by the great prospects opening
up for humanity as a result of man's entry into outer space" and
recognizes " the common interest of all mankind in the progress of
exploration and use of]{.underline} outer [space for]{.underline}
**[peaceful purposes]{.underline}**."

This obviously means that [the]{.underline} **[fate of
humanity]{.underline}** [is in the **core of its
attention**]{.underline}. This paper attempts to demonstrate the ability
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the need for international space law to face
the critical situation of the Earth in extreme danger, including the
legal examination and the use of juridical provisions presented in the
recommendations of the main scientific documents already drawn up on
this transcendental subject. In conclusion, some [viable [initiatives
in]{.mark} the **[space law]{.mark}**]{.underline} field
[are]{.underline} proposed as [**[contribut]{.mark}**ions to efforts to
provide **Earth with [new guarantees of survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I. The Preventive Function of Law

The paper's proposals raise the opportunity and the need to expand the
scope and the objectives of international space law, including in it
specific space issues of the Earth and of its life expressions.
Furthermore, it is timely to underline that " in today's world, the
preventive function of law is more vital than ever," as observed Manfred
Lachs (1914-1993) about 28 years ago. For him, it would be necessary for
men around the world to feel this reality, " in order to incite them to
abandon something of the parish spirit and give them the feeling of the
existence of a common interest, and of responsibility in application of
law in the everyday life of nations, as well as to make them understand
that, as usually is said, it is worth more act wisely together than
commit follies separately," At the same time, as a notable jurist and
thinker, Lachs foresaw the dangers that the Earth is currently
experiencing: "Today, it is required to work at a time when science and
technology have placed in man's hands weapons capable of creating a
danger to life and even cause total destruction; when modern techniques
create other dangers threatening the earth, water and air; when economic
and political relations between the states require that a new order
abolishes abyss between rich and hungry \[\...\]" .7 If the world
already was in great danger in the 1980s, what could be the magnitude of
danger today?

II, Poly-Catastrophe

"Dark times \[\...\] are not only not new, they are not a rarity in
history," as Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) observed.8 But today we are
certainly living in often darker times. According to the Global
Solidarity, Global Responsibility: An Appeal for World Governance -
launched in Geneva, Switzerland, on 6 March 2012, and endorsed by the
Collegium International members

> \"[we are facing [a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[conjunction of]{.mark}

III\. Our World Today

The new Global Sustainable Development Goals - Transforming our World:
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development10 - have been adopted by
Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, during the
meeting at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York from 25-27
September 2015 - with the UN celebrating its 70th anniversary. Paragraph
14 of this historic document presents the vision of the UN General
Assembly (UNGA) on the world global situation today, as follows: "We are
meeting at a time of immense challenges to sustainable development.
Billions of our citizens continue to live in poverty and are denied a
life of dignity. There are rising inequalities within and among
countries. There are enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and
power. Gender inequality remains a key challenge. Unemployment,
particularly youth unemployment, is a major concern. [Global health
threats, more frequent and intense **[natural disasters]{.mark}**,
spiraling]{.underline} [**[conflict]{.mark}**, violent]{.underline}
[**extremism**, **[terror]{.mark}**ism and **related humanitarian
crises**]{.underline} [and forced displacement of people threaten to
**[reverse]{.mark} much of the**]{.underline} development
[**[progress]{.mark}** **made in recent decades**. **Natural resource**
depletion and adverse impacts of]{.underline} [**environmental
degradation**, including desertification, drought, land degradation,
freshwater scarcity and loss of biodiversity, add to and exacerbate the
list of]{.underline} **[challenges]{.underline}** which [**humanity
faces**. Climate change is one of the]{.underline} **[greatest
challenges of our time]{.underline}** and its adverse impacts undermine
the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development.
Increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and
other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and
low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries
and small island developing States. [The]{.underline} **[[survival
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** many societies, and of the biological support
systems of [[**the planet**, are **at risk**]{.underline}."]{.mark}

" Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for
natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are
generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries
at all levels of development," as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) says in Climate Change 2014 - Synthesis Report - Summary
for Policymakers.11

IV\. Care for Our Common Home

Pope Francis in his 2015 Encyclical Letter Laudato Si \~ On Care for Our
Common Home - issued in 25 May - makes an " urgent appeal for a new
dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet." According
to Pope, "we require a new and universal solidarity," as " our present
situation is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity."

[" The Earth]{.underline}, our home," - he stresses - " [is beginning to
look more and more like an immense **pile of filth**]{.underline},"
because " [each year hundreds of millions of]{.underline} **[tons of
waste]{.underline}** [are generated, much of it non-biodegradable,
highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from
construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and
industrial sources]{.underline}."

Pope Francis also warns:

> "A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently
> witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system \[\...} most of
> global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of
> greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others)
> released mainly as a result of human activity \[\...\] The problem is
> aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of
> fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system.
> Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the
> soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes."
>
> "Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle
> which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability
> of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural
> production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of

> may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented
> destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us,"
> as " climate change is a global problem with grave implications:
> environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of
> goods."

Moreover, Pope Francis remarks:

> "We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of
> consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society,
> where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented
> levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable

>
> "Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking
> for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation.
> But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of concern is
> much greater than the economic benefits to be obtained," points out
> Pope Francis, And he adds that " the alliance between the economy and
> technology ends up sidelining anything unrelated to its immediate
> interests."
>
> "The failure of global summits on the environment makes it plain that
> our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many
> special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the
> common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will
> not be affected."
>
> " It is foreseeable that, once certain resources have been depleted,
> the scene will be set for new wars, albeit under the guise of noble
> claims. War always does grave harm to the environment and to the
> cultural riches of peoples, risks which are magnified when one
> considers nuclear arms and biological weapons \[\...\] Politics must
> pay greater attention to foreseeing new conflicts and addressing the
> causes which can lead to them. But powerful financial interests prove
> most resistant to this effort, and political planning tends to lack
> breadth of vision." 52

Wouldn't these observations also applicable to outer space?

V. The Tragedy f Common Goods

To explain how we arrived to it at current bad situation of the common
resources of Earth, Eduardo Felipe P. Matias recalls the article Tragedy
of Common Goods, written in 1968 by American ecologist Garrett Hardin
(1915-2003). Hardin recounts the case of a village of shepherds, whose
sheep used a pasture in common. Each shepherd was engaged in putting
more and more sheep in the pasture in order to increase his income. Over
time, the pasture was saturated, and there was no pasture left to feed
all the sheep. Most of them died. In sum, a tragedy. The shepherds
abused the common good to increase their individual gains, ignoring the
limits of nature. Although they gained more in short term, they lost out
in long run. Already in 1999, it was recognized that " a globalized
world requires a theory of global public goods to achieve crucial goals
such as financial stability, human security or the reduction of
environmental pollution." And that "many of today's international crises
have their roots in a serious under supply of global public goods." 13

As to global human security as a public good, the 1994 Human Development
Report has showed threats to world peace in transborder challenges:
unchecked population growth, disparities in economic opportunities,
environmental degradation, excessive international migration, narcotics
production and trafficking and international terrorism," It was equally
said that the society would be "willing to pay for public goods that
serve our common interest, be they shared systems of environmental
controls, the destruction of nuclear weapons, the control of
transmittable diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, the preservation of
ethnic conflicts or the reduction of refugee flows," 14

Addressing the present question of common goods in his 2015 Encyclical
Letter, Pope Francis points out:

> "Whether believers or not, we are agreed today that the Earth is
> essentially a shared inheritance, whose fruits are meant to benefit
> everyone. Hence every ecological approach needs to incorporate a
> social perspective which takes into account the fundamental rights of
> the poor and the underprivileged. The principle of the subordination
> of private property to the universal destination of goods, and thus
> the right of everyone to their use, is a golden rule of social conduct
> He also notes that " the natural environment is a collective good, the
> patrimony of all humanity and the responsibility of everyone. If we
> make something our own, it is only to administer it for the good of
> all. If we do not, we burden our consciences with the weight of having
> denied the existence of others."

Antonio Cassese (1937-2011) commented that " the concept of 'common
good' is not yet felt by the members of the international society. Only
state interests and their occasional convergence regulate international
relations." 15 The refugees tragedy in Europe today proves it.

VI\. Uncertainty

According to Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum, "
[in [the coming decade]{.mark} \[\...\] our lives will be even more
intensely shaped by transformative forces that are under way
already]{.underline}. The effects of climate change are accelerating and
the uncertainty about the global geopolitical context and the effects it
will have on international collaboration will remain. At the same time,
societies are increasingly under pressure from economic, political and
social developments including rising income inequality, but also
increasing national sentiment \[\...\] \[N\]ew technologies, such as the
Internet or emerging innovations will not bear fruit if regulatory
mechanisms at the international and national levels cannot be agreed
upon."

The Global Risks Report 2015, in turn, stresses: " 2015
[[differs]{.underline} **[markedly]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from the
past, [with]{.mark} rising]{.underline} [**[tech]{.mark}**nological
[**risks**, notably]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**cyber-attacks**]{.mark},
and]{.underline} [**new economic realities**, which remind us that
geopolitical tensions present themselves in a]{.underline} **[very
different world from]{.underline}** [**before**.
Information]{.underline} [flows instantly around the globe and emerging
technologies have boosted the influence of]{.underline} new players and
**[new types of warfare]{.underline}** \[\...\] **[Past
warnings]{.underline}** [of potential environmental catastrophes have
begun to be borne out, yet insufficient **progress**]{.underline} [has
been made]{.underline} - as reflected in the high concerns about failure
of climate-change adaptation and looming water crises in this year's
report."

The Report sees three risk constellations that bear out its findings:

> " 1) The [interconnections between geopolitics and economics are
> intensifying because States are making greater use of economic
> tools]{.underline}, from regional integration and trade treaties to
> protectionist policies and cross-border investments, [to

VII\. The Doomsday Clock

It is a symbolic clock face, marking countdown to doomsday. On 19
January 2015, it went on to score 23:57h, three minutes to midnight -
the time of global catastrophe able to extinguish the human species
inhabiting the Earth for many thousands of years. The decision to
advance the clock by two minutes was taken after consultations with more
than 20 scientists, including 17 Nobel laureates, among them famous
physicists, such as the British Stephen Hawking, the Japanese Masatoshi
Koshiba, pioneer in the study of neutrinos, and the American Leon
Lederman. The clock has been maintained since 1947 - when the Cold War
between the USA and the former USSR began - by the members of the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board. In 68
years, this sui generis indicator has been adjusted 22 times. Its worst
moment came in 1953, triggered by American and Soviet tests with
hydrogen weapons when the Clock scored 23:58h.

The Clock was conceived by the celebrated Chicago Atomic Scientists,
that had actively participated in the Manhattan Project in the creation
of the atomic bombs launched over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in
August 1945. Haunted with these bombings - that killed more than 100,000
people just on the first day, and many more in the following months -
they started to publish a mimeographed warning newsletter and then the
Bulletin. The closer they set the Clock to midnight, the closer the
scientists believe the world is to a global disaster.

The Clock hangs on a wall in a Bulletin\'s office in the University of
Chicago. Originally, it represented an analogy to the threat of global
nuclear war. But since 2007 it has also reflected climate change, and
new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict
irrevocable harm to humanity.

The analysis of the Bulletin - addressed "to the leaders and citizens of
the world" - says in sum: " In 2015, unchecked climate change, global
nuclear weapons modernizations, and out-sized nuclear weapons arsenals
pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of
humanity." The group said in a statement: " \[Wjorld leaders have failed
to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from
potential catastrophe. These failures of political leadership endanger
every person on Earth." In 2014, with the Doomsday Clock at five minutes
to midnight, the members of the Science and Security Board concluded
their assessment of the world security situation by writing: "[We
can]{.underline} **[manage]{.underline}** our
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, [or become]{.underline} **[victims of
it]{.underline}**. [The choice is ours, and]{.underline} **[the Clock is
ticking."]{.underline}**

In 2015, with the Clock hand moved forward to three minutes to midnight,
the Bulletin feels compelled to add, with a sense of great urgency:
"[The probability of]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} [**very high**, and the actions needed to reduce the
risks of disaster must be taken **very soon**]{.underline}."

In face of the dangers affecting today civilization on a global scale,
the Bulletin urges the citizens of the world to demand that their
leaders, among other measures, \"dramatically reduce proposed spending
on nuclear weapons modernization programs" , as " the USA and Russia
have hatched plans to essentially rebuild their entire nuclear triads in
coming decades, and other countries with nuclear weapons are following
suit."

At the start of 2015, nine States - the USA, Russia, the United Kingdom,
France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (North Korea) - possessed about 15,850 nuclear weapons, of
which 4,300 were deployed with operational forces. Roughly 1800 of these
weapons are kept in a state of high operational alert, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Launched on 15
June 2015, the SIPRI Yearbook 2015, which assesses the current state of
armament, disarmament and international security, notes as one of its
key findings that " all the nuclear weapon-possessing states are working
to develop new nuclear weapon systems and/or upgrade their existing
ones." 16

"There are too many nuclear weapons," said Sharon Squassoni, an expert
in nuclear weapons nonproliferation at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, USA. And she added: "The existence
of these weapons takes a lot of time, effort, and money to keep them
safe, and the bureaucracies are poised to keep these systems going
indefinitely." 17

For Hans M Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at
the Federation of American Scientists, " the projected costs of the
nuclear weapons modernization program are indefensible, and they
undermine the global disarmament regime." 18

That is why another demand from Bulletin, addressed to world leaders, is
to " re-energize the disarmament process." In practice it means that "
the USA and Russia, in particular, need to start negotiations on
shrinking their strategic and tactical nuclear arsenals."

The creation of " institutions specifically assigned to explore and
address potentially catastrophic misuses of new technologies," is also a
requirement proposed by the Bulletin.

The Bulletin's appeals are also, to some extent, applicable to outer
space, and some of its requirements can be objects of proper regulation
by international space law.

VIII\. Transparency and Confidence

[The Earth being in danger, the]{.underline} transparency and
confidence-building measures (**[[TCBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[are]{.mark} as **[vital as]{.mark}** those of **[collective
security]{.mark}**. These actions are means by which Governments [can
**share info**]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} [aiming at
[creating]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mutual
understanding]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [**trust**,
[reducing]{.mark}]{.underline} misconceptions and
[**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulations and [thereby]{.mark} helping both
to]{.underline} **[[prevent military
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and to foster]{.underline}
regional and [**global stability**. They played an important role during
the Cold War, contributing to reducing the risk of armed conflict
through mitigating misunderstandings]{.underline} on military actions,
particularly in situations where States lacked clear and timely
information.19 [The need for such measures in outer space activities has
increased significantly over the past 20 years, The world's growing
**[dependence on space]{.mark}-based systems and
tech**]{.underline}nologies [and the]{.underline}
**[info]{.underline}**rmation **[they provide]{.underline}** [[requires
**collaborative effort**]{.mark}s to address threats to the
sustainability and security of]{.underline} [outer space activities.
TCBMs " can]{.underline} reduce, or even **[eliminate]{.underline}**,
misunderstandings, mistrust and **[miscalculations]{.underline}** [with
regard to the activities and intentions of States in outer
space"]{.underline} , This is the conclusion of the Report of the Group
of Governmental Experts on TCBMs in Outer Space Activities - a study
adopted by consensus and issued on 29 July 2013.20

The Report adds that " [these measures can augment the safety,
**sustainability and security of day-to-day space
operations**]{.underline} [and can contribute both to the development of
mutual understanding and to the strengthening of friendly relations
between States and peoples."]{.underline}

It is acknowledged that " the existing treaties on outer space contain
several TCBMs of a mandatory nature. Non-legally binding measures for
outer space activities should complement the existing international
legal framework on space activities and should not undermine existing
legal obligations or ham per the lawful use of outer space, particularly
by emerging space actors." The Group also discussed other measures,
including those of a legally binding nature. The Group further agreed
that " such measures for outer space activities could contribute to, but
not act as a substitute for, measures to monitor the implementation of
arms limitation and disarmament agreements," help States to enhance
clarity of their peaceful intentions and create conditions for
establishing a predictable strategic situation in both the economic and
security arenas.

Similarly, included in the Report were \"coordination and consultative
mechanisms aimed at improving interaction between participants in outer
space activities and clarifying information and ambiguous situations."
Likewise the Report recommended a coordination between the Office for
Disarmament Affairs, the Office for Outer Space Affairs (OOSA) and other
appropriate UN entities. Moreover, the Report drafted " a series of
measures for outer space activities, including exchange of information
relating to national space policy such as major military expenditure in
outer space, notifications of outer space activities aimed at risk
reduction, and visits to space launch sites and facilities."

The Group took note of the "Guidelines for appropriate types of
confidencebuilding measures and for the implementation of such measures
on a global or regional level" , as contained in the " Study on the
application of confidence- building measures in outer space"21

TCBMs for outer space activities are integrated in a broader context.
The UN General Assembly endorsed, in its resolution 43/78 H, the
guidelines on confidence- building measures adopted by the Disarmament
Commission at its 1988 session. This resolution noted that "
confidence-building measures, while neither a substitute nor a
precondition for arms limitation and disarmament measures, can be
conducive to achieving progress in disarmament" .

The Report indicates the following categories of TCBMs for space
activities as relevant: " a) General transparency and
confidence-building measures aimed at enhancing the availability of
information on the space policy of States involved in outer space
activities; b) [**Info**rmation **exchange**]{.underline} [about
development programs for]{.underline} **[new space
systems]{.underline}**, as well as information about operational
space-based systems providing widely used services such as
meteorological observations or global positioning, navigation and
timing; c) The articulation of a State's principles and goals relating
to their exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes; d)
Specific information-exchange measures aimed at expanding the
availability of information on objects in outer space and their general
function, particularly those objects in Earth orbits; e) Measures
related to establishing norms of behavior for promoting spaceflight
safety such as launch notifications and consultations that aim at
avoiding potentially harmful interference, limiting orbital debris and
mini mizing the risk of collisions with other space objects; f)
[International cooperation measures in outer space activities, including
measures aimed at]{.underline} promoting [capacity-building]{.underline}
and disseminating data for sustainable economic and social development,
that are [consistent with existing international commitments and
obligations.]{.underline}

In fact, [[some]{.mark} TCBMs for outer space activities have
**[already]{.mark} been [enacted]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
multilateral and/or the national level. [They include pre-launch
notifications, space situational awareness data-sharing, notifications
of hazards to spaceflight safety and other significant events, and the
publication of national space policies.]{.underline} [**[But]{.mark}
they [need to be]{.mark}** further **[developed]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

IX\. Common Law of Mankind and Earth

**[More than ever, it is time to think big.]{.underline}** International
space law is usually defined as dealing with outer space, celestial
bodies - Moon and asteroids, Mars and other planets as well as with the
space activities which so far are carried out only by the human species
from the planet Earth, However, the very specific situation of Earth as
celestial body responsible for the creation and development of the
international space law is not taken into the due consideration. Earth
is not recognized as one of the main objectives of this branch of law.

Ironically, in this context, we could say that the international space
law takes care of the solar system and the universe as a whole, minus of
Earth, although it is the cradle of the exploration and use of outer
space in general, and, therefore, of international space law.

Let's take just two examples. "At its broadest, space law comprises all
the law that may govern or apply to outer space and activities in and
relating to outer space," write Francis Lyall and Paul B. Larsen.22 In
the same sense, the Education Curriculum of Space Law, adopted by United
Nations Office For Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), on March, 2014, states
that " space law can be described as the body of law applicable to and
governing space related activities."23

Nevertheless, the **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, of
1967, [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least, two [**[extremely important
norms for]{.mark}** the security of **[Earth]{.mark}** and its
inhabitants **[in Article]{.mark}**]{.underline}s IV and
**[[IX]{.underline}]{.mark}**, respectively: 1) "not to place in orbit
around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds
of weapons of mass destruction," and 2) to avoid "harmful contamination
and adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from
introduction of extraterrestrial matter." [The sky always has played a
crucial role in the evolution of mankind and all life manifestations on
Earth. However, today the **importance of outer space to our
planet**]{.underline} [and its]{.underline} **[common
life]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} [**increased as never before**.
The data coming from **[sat]{.mark}**ellite[**s** are]{.mark} absolutely
[fundamental for]{.mark} any efforts to assure the
[sustainability]{.mark} of Earth and all its life expressions. In this
global reality it is]{.underline} [**sheer recklessness**
to]{.underline} **[ignore the imperative of protecting our planet and
its population]{.underline}**, based on inclusive international space
legislation. Hence the necessity of a Common Law of Mankind24 and Earth,
specially related with international space law.

More and more, **[outer space]{.underline}** [protection]{.underline}25
[must be seen as]{.underline} an **[indispensable]{.underline}** factor
[to]{.underline} **[Earth protection]{.underline}**, and vice-verse. As
the globalization of Earth - with the interdependence of physical,
social and political events - is more than ever recognized as an
undeniable fact, the universalization of outer space {its cosmic reach),
with the interconnection of everything with everything, cannot be
bypassed, as it has been in the past. As Ervin Laszlo remarks, " the
reality we call universe is a seamless whole, evolving over eons of
cosmic time and producing conditions where life, and then mind and
consciousness can emerge."26 Or, as Edgar Morin says, "we carry inside
of us all the cosmos" and "we are all children of the sun."27

X. It Is up to International Space Law

[[If we are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[really
[determined]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[likely apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}** visible [**on the
horizon**, one of the main tasks of the international space law that we
must trigger is to]{.underline} [**help save the Earth from space**,
using]{.underline} the **[powerful]{.underline}** scientific and
technological **[resources]{.underline}** [we have installed
there]{.underline}.

[Centuries ago Earth ceased to be the center of the universe, as our
ancestors thought. But in face of unprecedented global dangers that
threaten our planet today, its place cannot be other than the center of
our universal concerns. Probably, a collapse of Earth would deprive the
universe of a specie of intelligent life.]{.underline}

In reality, as Jonathan Schell (1943-2014) pointed out, " the vision
that counts is the view from Earth, from life," as " from our strategic
position on Earth different view opens, bigger even than the one taken
from space. It is the vision of our children and grandchildren, of all
future generations of mankind, stretching ahead of us into the
future."28

The question, as posed by Antonio Cassese, is that " international
society is still grounded in the mere juxtaposition of its subjects -
not in their solidarity, let alone in their integration." 29

In any event, " from the microbes inhabiting the earth beneath our feet
to environments of the universe unknown to us now, the next 100 years of
ecological discoveries will influence our lives. We enter a time when
society is armed with the scientific knowledge and ability to make
responsible decisions," as a recent editorial of Science affirms.30 And
with " a new human consciousness " , as says Edgar Morin.31

So, [" the choice is]{.underline} our: form [a]{.underline} **[global
partnership]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[care for
Earth]{.underline}** and one another [or risk the]{.underline}
**[destruction of]{.underline}** ourselves and the diversity of
**[life]{.underline}**," according to The Earth Charter.32

The current global situation seems to be so serious that the titanic
work of saving mankind and our planet can be seen as a kind of utopia,
maybe the major utopia of all times. A dream still far from having a
general support. Coincidentally we'll commemorate in 2016 the 500 years
since the English humanist and statesman Thomas More (1478-1535)
published his Utopia„ considered " a playfully serious social critique
to a social reality deadly and tragically grave."33

of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University and previously

HBisevac)

In February, Gen. Jay Raymond, the new chief of space operations and the
head of U.S. Space Command, publicly stated that two Russian spacecraft
were tailing a U.S. satellite. He said that Russia's behavior was
"highly unusual and disturbing." On April 15, U.S. Space Command
announced that Russia tested an anti-satellite weapon. [[Russia]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [China]{.mark} both [recognize]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
[American]{.mark} high-precision [warfighting]{.mark} is
**[dependent]{.mark}** [on **space systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to the U.S. director of national intelligence, [[both]{.mark}
Russia and China are developing [capabilities to **destroy**]{.mark}
**[U.S.]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}** in all orbital
regimes]{.underline} --- at all altitudes. But, unlike in the past, the
United States is not on its own. It has allies and partners to turn to.

During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union were the two
dominant space powers and both worked diligently to develop space
weapons. European allies, France in particular, decried efforts to
create anti-satellite systems. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the number of spacefaring nations has markedly increased. And, as the
world has become more dependent on space systems, attitudes about space
security have changed. The United States has demonstrated its commitment
to space security through the revival of U.S. Space Command and the
establishment of the U.S. Space Force. Other countries have, too. France
and Japan, for example, have announced the creation of their own
military space commands. NATO has declared that space is an operational
domain. Now, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has allies
who are eager to create a more robust network for **monitoring adversary
activity** on orbit and to establish a **unified space doctrine** to
achieve a **resilient** space security **framework**.]{.underline}
[[Washington]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [build]{.mark} a

[build]{.mark} a [more]{.mark} **[robust]{.mark} [network]{.mark}** [to

norms**]{.mark} and practices [that]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}
**[destabilizing]{.mark} [military]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}** [in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Cold War

During the Cold War, the United States included allies in its national
security space activities but only on a limited basis. America's focus
was on reconnaissance satellites, which were a closely held secret. The
U.S. government did not even acknowledge the existence of the National
Reconnaissance Office until 1992. Space reconnaissance activities were
not publicly discussed in any detail. Cooperation in this sensitive area
of U.S. space activity primarily involved the limited sharing of
space-derived intelligence with select allies. Only the heads of NATO
members were briefed on the existence of intelligence satellites. Beyond
those heads of states, only the British had privileged access to
American space capabilities. The United States shared raw images from
imagery satellites with the United Kingdom as far back as the 1960s.

The importance of space systems did not reduce allies' concerns about
the weaponization of space, even when the Soviet threat became more
pronounced. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union possessed a co-orbital
anti-satellite weapon --- a satellite designed to maneuver next to its
target on orbit and destroy it --- called Istrebitel' sputnikov or
"satellite killer." The United States promptly responded to the threat.
In 1976, then-CIA director George H.W. Bush sent a memorandum to the
national security advisor, stating that the United States needed to
re-evaluate the vulnerability of its overhead reconnaissance systems.
Beginning in 1977, the United States reinvigorated its efforts to
develop an operational anti-satellite capability.

In the late 1960s, the British had launched the Skynet-series
communication satellites that provided secure communications across the
European theater; the system is located in geosynchronous orbit ---
22,236 miles from Earth. London was primarily concerned with
discouraging the United States and Soviet Union from developing
anti-satellite weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit. The
British worried that, if the United States developed anti-satellite
weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit, the Soviet Union would
follow suit and threaten Skynet. The British did, however, support the
United States in matching the existing Soviet anti-satellite capability.

Most European allies were, however, overtly critical --- or lukewarm at
best --- about America's efforts to develop an anti-satellite weapon.
The French, in particular, were especially critical and called upon the
United States and Soviet Union to prevent an arms race in space and
implement arms control for anti-satellite weapons. Even as the allies
began building their own space capabilities, they were not supportive of
U.S. efforts to respond militarily to the Soviet space threat. Many NATO
members were not fully aware of how dependent the alliance had become on
information derived from space systems. Washington had grown accustomed
to pursuing national security activities in space under a shroud of
secrecy with minimal allied consultation. The Cold War legacy of U.S.
dominance and secrecy has left many in the space community with the
mistaken belief that the United States should again go it alone.

Ready Allies

In the post-Cold War era, [the [space]{.mark} [environment]{.mark} has
**[markedly changed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There has been a
[proliferation of]{.underline} both American and foreign **[commercial
space capabilities]{.underline}**, an [expansion of the **number** of
**spacefaring nations**]{.underline}, a [greater **reliance** on space
systems]{.underline} by not just the United States but also its allies,
[and a significant growth in]{.underline} the [**number** and
**sophistication** of **threat actors** in space]{.underline}. While the
United States, China, and Russia are certainly the most capable
spacefaring nations, [Washington's [allies]{.mark} [have much]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [offer]{.mark} [to create **greater resiliency** for
space]{.mark} systems]{.underline} and to win a war that extends into
outer space. [[As]{.mark} the [threats expand]{.mark}, U.S.
[cooperation]{.mark} with allies [ought to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} as
well]{.underline}. Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has emphasized the necessity of expanding allied
relationships in the space arena. Unlike during the Cold War, [American
allies are **willing** and **eager** to collaborate with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

For example, last year, [[NATO]{.mark} [declared]{.mark} [space]{.mark}
an [operational domain]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, this
announcement [should be **followed** up with
**doctrine**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2019, the U.K. Ministry of Defense
published a document entitled "Towards a Defense Space Strategy." The
British government is intent on creating a cadre of space experts that
can ensure the security of U.K. and allied national security space
systems. Britain's focus is on space-related training and collaboration
with capable spacefaring allies.

Moreover, the United States already cooperates with Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany at U.S. Space
Command's Combined Space Operations Center located at Vandenberg Air
Force Base. Additionally, allies participate in the Schriever Wargames
that examine "critical space and cyberspace issues in depth."

Today, unlike during the Cold War, U.S. allies are more aware of the
threats to space systems. The United Kingdom has made it very clear that
it views space as a warfighting domain. [[America's spacefaring]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [can [serve]{.mark} as an
[important resource for ensuring]{.mark} **continued [U.S. space
dominance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Leveraging Allies

Current allied involvement is a good start, but [[more can be
done]{.mark} to **prepare** for **war** extending into outer
space]{.underline} --- particularly [in two areas:]{.underline} [1)
**s**pace **s**ituational **a**wareness]{.underline}, now more commonly
called space domain awareness; [and 2) establishing **space-behavior
norms**]{.underline}.

In January of this year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced
his country's establishment of a Space Domain Mission Unit.
Additionally, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a stated goal
of providing high-quality space domain awareness and of "maintaining
four information-gathering satellite systems." While the unit will be
located at Fuchu Air Base and use a radar "capable of monitoring space
systems up to an altitude of 5,800 kilometers \[3,600 miles\]," the
Japanese Ministry of Defense "will share information collected by the
facility with U.S. forces." Japan is providing a replicable model for
other spacefaring nations.

[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} can [make a [particularly valuable]{.mark}
contribution to space security [in]{.mark} the realm of **[space domain
awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As an [increasingly [diverse]{.mark}
[set of sensors]{.mark} are [integrated]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} space [domain]{.mark} awareness resources]{.underline}, a
[[more]{.mark} [accurate picture of **adversary activity**]{.mark} in
space can be achieved]{.underline}. Fundamentally, to obtain better
space domain awareness, terrestrial real estate matters. More
ground-tracking stations allow the United States and its allies to
better track threats on orbit. By using radar and optical systems spread
out all over the Earth, it is possible to have much better coverage of
potential threats in space. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can also work with allies who do not have any
space capabilities to install **optical telescopes** and **radar
systems** that can create a more robust and **global network** for
**monitoring space threats**]{.underline}. Spacefaring allies, even in
the most nascent stage of development, can play an invaluable role in
this mission.

In early 2020, French President Emanuel Macron announced his country's
establishment of a space command that will be placed under the French
Air Force. According to reports by the French Ministry of Defense, the
French space command will develop a modified version of its Syracuse
satellites that can observe threats on orbit and use on-board weapons to
engage them if necessary. Even if France decides not to arm its
satellites in the near term, its Syracuse system will have strong
potential for expanding allied space domain awareness in space.

Though London has promised to present a formal U.K. space defense
strategy, one has not yet materialized. During the Cold War, Britain was
the only European ally that provided political support for America's
efforts to develop space weapons. Up until very recently, however,
Britain has been largely silent on space security issues. Last year,
then Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said the United Kingdom would
remain at the forefront of the space domain. London is investing more in
space intelligence capabilities, but it is not keeping pace with the
threats from more sophisticated states.

Smaller allied countries might have limited but highly specialized
services to offer a space coalition. Estonia, for example, has a
reputation for high-tech innovation, especially in cyber security and
digital services. Estonia has established its Space Office, which is
working with universities and start-ups to develop a broad spectrum of
satellites, especially micro-satellites. U.S. investment in countries
like Estonia can help create space innovation eco-systems that can
contribute to the overall resiliency of allied military space activity.

The integration of allied and international commercial space domain
awareness and satellite systems is a necessary task, but there are
substantial obstacles to overcome in the process. A RAND report stated
that "U.S.-European military space activities suffer a plight equal if
not worse than the slate of more traditional interoperability issues
that arise among NATO allies." [[As more countries contribute]{.mark} to
space domain awareness]{.underline}, [**[uniformity]{.mark}** [of
data]{.mark} types will be of even **[greater
importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many allied space programs are in a
**nascent** stage]{.underline} and their potential has not been fully
realized. [[Washington]{.mark} [should]{.mark} actively encourage and
[work]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} European [[partners]{.mark} in
their [efforts to develop more capable]{.mark} space
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} European
[[allies develop]{.mark} [more sophisticated]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark} for monitoring]{.underline} the space environment,
[[Washington]{.mark} [should push for]{.mark} interoperable systems that
enable the [**seamless sharing** of data across
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The United States should work with European partners to develop a
framework for monitoring and reacting to adversary threat activity such
as a joint architecture for processing data from the many different
allied space domain awareness sensors. [A unified doctrine would focus
on measures that enable foreign government and commercial systems to
augment any loss of U.S. capability due to an attack]{.underline}. There
are, however, potential legal obstacles and data-compatibility issues
that will likely prevent the realization of an effective unified
doctrine in the near term. Most importantly, [Washington should work
with its spacefaring allies to develop comprehensive plans for reacting
to an attack on an allied space asset]{.underline}. However, a military
response does not have to include an attack on an adversary space
system. The fundamental need is having the ability to respond quickly
and in a unified manner to any space attack. An integrated diplomatic
response should be created for space crises as well.

Establishing Norms in Space

During the Cold War, the United States refused to establish public
policies regarding threats to space systems. The State Department and
Intelligence Community consistently advised the White House not to even
publicly provide a definition of outer space. Refraining from
establishing specific and clearly articulated policies is no longer an
option in the post-Cold War era.

[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and potential allies --- [[can
assist]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[in **establishing**]{.mark} [**norms**
in space]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Paris moves ahead with deploying
on-orbit weapons, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [[and]{.mark} all other **[NATO]{.mark}**
**members** [should work]{.mark}]{.underline} with France [[to develop
**specific rules of engagement** for]{.mark} the use of **[space
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fundamentally, France is making it clear
that Washington has a potential partner in a space war that is willing
to use offensive weapons. It is essential, however, to ensure that there
is an agreed-upon framework for using French offensive capabilities to
respond to an attack against an allied system. Additionally, Washington
should strongly urge Paris not to test any weapon systems against
objects in space. Such testing could create debris that is a threat to
other satellites and could encourage Russia and China to follow up with
similar tests.

Because of greater access to space technology, the number of spacefaring
nations will continue to grow while there will be an increase in the
number of state actors that possess space weapons. The 2019 Indian
anti-satellite weapon demonstration is a case in point. Iran, for
another example, could construct a crude anti-satellite weapon in the
near term. Therefore, it is imperative for the United States to work
with Israel --- the most capable spacefaring nation in the Middle East
--- in monitoring and deterring Tehran from entering the space weapons
arena.

[Russia's recent anti-satellite weapon test and tailing of a U.S.
satellite]{.underline}, and previous U.S. State Department statements
about Moscow's destabilizing behavior [highlight the **lack** of
**established norms** for military space operations]{.underline}. For
example, how close is too close for a satellite? Clearly, establishing a
code of conduct in space is something that the United States cannot do
on its own. [It should be a **joint effort** with spacefaring allies
around the globe]{.underline}. Additionally, it is imperative that
America and its allies publicly confront Russia, in particular, about
its dangerous behavior in space.

Russia, China, and the United States are especially concerned about
rendezvous and proximity operations such as maneuvering close to another
space object. If a country conducts rendezvous and proximity operations
without providing any warning or explanation, the action could be
treated as a hostile military act. Just as an uncoordinated approach by
a foreign vessel to a U.S. Navy ship would be treated as an aggressive
act, so too should similar maneuvers that involve American and allied
spacecraft. Therefore, [it is [vital for Washington to work]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [to establish]{.mark} [what]{.mark}
specific **[space behaviors]{.mark}** [will be considered]{.mark}
**[unacceptable]{.mark}** [and to]{.mark} **communicate**]{.underline}
--- [and **[enforce]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[such standards]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} aggressive spacefaring nations like [Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies should
work collectively to prevent the testing of weapons in
space]{.underline}. The [**debris** generated from these tests poses a
**threat** to the **satellites**]{.underline} of all spacefaring
nations. [If more nations begin testing anti-satellite
weapons]{.underline}, [military space systems could be inadvertently
damaged]{.underline}. [This situation could lead to an overall
**escalation** in **preexisting tension**]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies providing
a **clearly defined code of conduct** for national security space
activities is a **feasible** and **necessary step** to take in the
immediate term]{.underline}.

Stronger Together

Certainly, though no one wants a war to begin in or extend into outer
space, ignoring this possibility would be extremely negligent. The
United States possesses highly sophisticated national security space
systems that will be a prime target for capable spacefaring adversaries
if a conflict should arise. In the past, the United States has presumed
it can and will fight alone in space --- but that is no longer
necessary. [[Washington can better ensure]{.mark} its **[dominance in
space]{.mark}** [if it]{.mark} more [fully **embraces**]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Washington would be wise to build a coalition that creates a more
robust system for monitoring the space domain]{.underline}, [reacting to
space threats]{.underline}, [and prevailing in a war that extends into
outer space]{.underline}. Building a space coalition --- especially one
that includes allies from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia --- is no
simple task. But, working towards systems integration and also a common
space doctrine is positive step forward towards increased resiliency of
the space systems that are essential for precision warfighting. Of
course, technical systems cannot be the only focus of the coalition; it
should also devote attention to the development of norms for military
space activity.

Hyten has stated that "**[[trying to fight alone in space would be a
mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}**" --- [a mistake that we cannot afford to
make]{.underline}.

#### Lack of [space governance]{.underline} prevents [space colonization]{.underline}. 

Marko **Kovic, 18** (Marko Kovic, PhD from the University of Zurich and

HBisevac)

The answer is no. [There is **[no]{.mark} meaningful
[space]{.mark}**]{.underline}-colonisation **[[governance
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}** to speak of. As of now, in 2018, space
colonisation is a veritable free-for-all. And this [[absence]{.mark} of
a forward-looking space-colonisation governance framework could [have
**disastrous consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Almost any kind of modern-day human activity is embedded within one or
multiple governance frameworks, and [the greater the scale of the
activity]{.underline}, [the more comprehensive and complex the
governance framework tends to be]{.underline}. Building a private house
for yourself is relatively simpler in terms of governance rules than
building a large commercial high-rise, and building a high-rise is
relatively simpler than building a transcontinental bridge, and so
forth. Even though people tend to dislike the labyrinthine ways of
bureaucratic procedure and the frustrating reality of red tape,
[[governance]{.mark} is]{.underline} both
[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} and a blessing. [[Rules]{.mark} that
govern **human activity** [reduce **transaction
costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[create]{.mark} **[planning
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and **[increase]{.mark}** the
[**probability** of **good**]{.mark} **[outcomes]{.mark}** in uncertain
decision-making contexts]{.underline}. The epistemic and moral [progress
of human civilisation]{.underline} seems to, at the very least,
[correlate with progress in]{.underline} collective
[governance]{.underline}. We live in a rules-based world, and we are
better off for it.

[[Space]{.mark} [col]{.mark}onisation will [create]{.mark} a new set of
[governance challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though these
challenges are not fundamentally different from existing governance
problems, they are on a scale never before seen in human history. [[That
is why]{.mark} [space]{.mark}]{.underline}-colonisation
[[governance]{.mark} [should be a **global
priority**]{.mark}]{.underline} even today, before colonisation is
technologically viable. [[If we fail to create]{.mark} an adequate
[governance framework]{.mark}]{.underline} for space colonisation, [[we
risk]{.mark} **bad outcomes**]{.underline} ([such as **slowing down
colonisation efforts**]{.underline}), **[very bad
outcomes]{.underline}** ([such as [**failing** to **colonise at
all**]{.mark}]{.underline}), [or even **catastrophic
outcomes**]{.underline} (s[uch as a galaxy populated by warring and
suffering people]{.underline}).

#### Colonization solves [inevitable extinction]{.underline}.

Existential risks are risks that might lead to the extinction of
humankind \[1\]. [Natural **[existential risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[such as **asteroids**]{.mark} that might **crash into
Earth**]{.underline}) [are]{.underline} basically
[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [**risks** of a **giant asteroid**
crashing into Earth today is the same as it was **500 years**
ago]{.underline}. **[[Anthropogenic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ~~man-made~~
**[existential [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, on the other hand, [are
[**growing** in]{.mark} [**number** and
**severity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They are a [**side-effect**
of]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}nological [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
The more we develop technologically, the greater man-made existential
risks become. [[Nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, to name
only one example, [are a **[direct consequence]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
scientific and technological **[progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[There are different approaches to existential risk
mitigation]{.underline}. [One approach is]{.underline} to develop
targeted strategies for specific existential risks. If we want to reduce
the existential risk posed by nuclear weapons, then we can and should
develop specific strategies for that risk.

Another approach is [to develop and pursue]{.underline} what can be
called [**[meta-strategies]{.mark}** that [target]{.mark}
**[all]{.mark}** existential [risks **at once**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
One of [**[most effective]{.mark}** meta-strategies for tackling
existential risks]{.underline} in general [[is **space
colonization**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[If we]{.mark} manage to
[establish]{.mark} permanent and self-sustainable human
[habitats]{.mark} **[beyond Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then [our
**proverbial existential [eggs]{.mark}** are **[not all in one
basket]{.mark}** anymore]{.underline}. For example, [[if
**disaster**]{.mark} **[strikes]{.mark}** on Earth]{.underline}, [but
there are **billions** of humans living on **Venus** and
**Mars**]{.underline}, [[humankind would **continue**]{.mark} **to
exist** even with Earth-humans gone]{.underline}.

[Because of existential risks]{.underline}, a [**[long-term
future]{.mark}** [in which]{.mark} [humankind]{.mark} still
[exists]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [[**certainly** has to be]{.mark} a
[future in which]{.mark} [humankind]{.mark} has [**succeeded**
in]{.mark} **[colonizing space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today, even
though we regularly venture into space, we do not yet have space
colonization capabilities. There are a number of technological
challenges that we need to overcome in order to become capable of space
colonization. One of those challenges is energy. There are several
reasons why.

Carla **Crandall 10**. J.D. Candidate at the J. Reuben Clark Law School
at Brigham Young University, "Why Aren\'t We Using that Intel Stuff?
Using Reconnaissance Satellite Imagery in Domestic Disaster Prevention
and Response", Brigham Young University Law Review, 2010 B.Y.U.L. Rev.
1831, Lexis

[By providing]{.underline} disaster planners and responders with [a
common operational picture]{.underline}, n4 [[satellite imagery plays an
important role in]{.underline}]{.mark} both ~~manmade~~ and [natural
[disaster prevention and response]{.mark}]{.underline}. Former Director
of Central Intelligence (DCI) John Deutch explained, for example, that
\"[within hours]{.underline} after a disaster strikes \[[analysts\] [can
assess]{.mark} and report the nature and scope of the
[damage]{.mark}]{.underline} - conditions of roads, airports, hospitals,
[[and]{.mark} the status of potential [secondary]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[\*1832\] [[threats such as]{.underline}]{.mark} dams and **[[nuclear
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" n5 Unfortunately, however, some of
the U.S. government\'s most sophisticated assets and capabilities are
being underutilized - due in large part to a lack of clarity and
understanding as to how these resources can appropriately be used within
the United States. n6 According to one study, \"the ultimate effect is
missed opportunities to collect, exploit and disseminate domestic
information critical to \... preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from\" both manmade and natural disasters. n7 Arguably, these
opportunities have been lost due to inadequate transparency - driven by
a culture of secrecy - and an unclear legal framework surrounding the
domestic use of reconnaissance satellite imagery. n8 Indeed, from the
time of its inception, the domestic imagery program has been mired in
concern and uncertainty as to its legitimacy and precise parameters.
This uneasiness stems largely from the fact that most of the legal
constructs that have been established were developed exclusively within
the executive branch, leading to doubts as to the sufficiency of
programmatic oversight. Perhaps nothing has highlighted these legal
inadequacies more than the recent debacle surrounding the National
Applications Office (NAO) - an office within the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) that was designed to facilitate wider domestic use of
\[\*1833\] reconnaissance satellite capabilities, but which closed
before it even opened because of concerns related to civil liberties and
the involvement of the Department of Defense (DoD) in civil affairs. n9
In light of this background, this Comment highlights the critical role
reconnaissance satellite imagery can play in disaster planning and
response and proposes reforms to address the concerns that currently
impede its wider use. Specifically, Part II provides background about
the utility of satellite imagery in domestic disaster prevention and
response and discusses the comparative advantages of imagery from
reconnaissance satellites over that provided by commercial sources. Part
III analyzes the development of the current legal framework surrounding
the domestic use of reconnaissance satellite assets and argues that a
lack of transparency and clear legal guidance contributes to the
underutilization of these vital capabilities within the homeland. Part
IV explores the recent proposal to create the National Applications
Office and discusses the challenges to using satellite imagery that were
exposed by that plan. Part V proposes reforms designed to facilitate
wider exploitation of reconnaissance satellite imagery for disaster
prevention and response. Finally, Part VI concludes. II. Background and
Context Imagery collection via satellites has a long pedigree and
contributes to the resolution of a wide array of challenges across the
globe. Its utility extends from monitoring the proliferation of nuclear
weapons n10 to managing refugee camps. n11 This Part focuses on the
value of satellite imagery specifically to disaster prevention and
response. Beyond explaining satellite imagery\'s general utility in the
disaster context, this Part also highlights the relative advantages of
using reconnaissance satellites over those operated by commercial
vendors. \[\*1834\] A. Satellite Imagery in the Disaster Context Though
it is perhaps most recognized for its value after disasters, [[satellite
imagery]{.mark} also plays a significant role in disaster
**prevention**]{.underline}. In fact, [it [has proven valuable in
responding to]{.mark} **virtually [every type]{.mark}** [of
disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[analysts can
examine]{.mark} imagery for signs of topographic faulting to generate
[tectonic maps]{.mark}]{.underline} n12 [that can aid planners in
**earthquake zones** with land-use decisions. Imagery is also useful in
demarcating watersheds and potential **[flood
zones]{.mark}**]{.underline}. n13 Indeed, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) uses satellite imagery to create flood maps
that determine risk premiums for the National Flood Insurance Program.
n14 [Infrared imaging satellite systems can also be used to assess
potential **[volcanic activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, n15 thereby
[allowing officials to evacuate]{.underline} vulnerable citizens [prior
to an impending eruption]{.underline}. Finally, satellite imagery has
also been used to prevent manmade disasters, such as those created by
terrorist attacks. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA),
for instance, is charged with analyzing satellite imagery in support of
national security objectives, including the prevention of terrorist
attacks. n16 NGA accomplishes this mission by, among other things,
analyzing imagery to provide officials with information about
\"vulnerabilities to \[the country\'s\] critical infrastructure and
national assets\" that \"can be the basis for planning and responding to
threats or natural disasters.\" n17 Current customers of NGA\'s domestic
products include not only federal agencies such as FEMA and the
\[\*1835\] United States Geological Survey (USGS), but also the National
Guard and local government officials. n18 As important as satellite
imagery is to disaster prevention, [its [utility during]{.mark} disaster
**[relief]{.mark}** efforts [is **immeasurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
After a catastrophic disaster, [one of the most challenging
problems]{.underline} facing responders [is that]{.underline} the damage
is often so overwhelming that [it is difficult to know where to begin
recovery operations]{.underline}. n19 [Satellite [imagery]{.mark} can
help combat this problem by [provid]{.mark}ing [**damage assessments**
that **guide first responders**]{.mark} to areas where their efforts
will be most fruitful]{.underline}. After an earthquake, for instance,
[imagery analysts can direct search and rescue teams]{.underline} not
only to areas with the highest concentration of collapsed buildings, but
also to those with the highest number of potential survivors. More
specifically, imagery interpreters can provide information to rescuers
as to which collapsed structures were previously multistory, n20 and
thus would be more likely to have voids necessary for survival after a
collapse. Moreover, [in response to wildfires, analysts can identify hot
spots]{.underline} using infrared imaging satellites s[o that
firefighters can appropriately direct their suppression
effort]{.underline}s. n21 During floods and tsunamis, satellite imagery
can be used to assess damage to infrastructure, such as bridges and
roads, to effectively direct the movement of aid into a disaster area.
n22 Finally, in response to manmade disasters such as those created by
terrorist attacks, satellite imagery can be used to determine the extent
of destruction. For instance, after the 2001 World Trade \[\*1836\]
Center attacks, NGA used satellite imagery and high-resolution elevation
data to create models of the damaged area, providing responders with
better situational awareness with which to carry out their missions. n23
B. The Comparative Advantages of Using U.S. Reconnaissance Assets Though
satellite imagery can thus clearly play a significant role in disaster
preparation and response, it does not necessarily follow that U.S.
reconnaissance assets should be used for its collection. While
historically imagery systems within the United States were
government-controlled, privatization efforts that began during the
Reagan Administration have since created a multi-billion dollar
commercial satellite industry. n24 Today, the average person needs
nothing more than an Internet connection to acquire at least some form
of satellite imagery. Even NGA - the government agency charged with
exploiting imagery from reconnaissance satellites - routinely contracts
with commercial imagery providers to acquire their products. n25 This
raises the question of why reconnaissance assets should be used at all.
While [[recon]{.mark}naissance [satellites]{.mark}]{.underline} were
developed to monitor activities in foreign areas where the U.S.
government could not procure on-ground information, their [[unique
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[offer advantages over
commercial]{.mark} satellites in the domestic disaster context.
First]{.underline}, though the [[precise resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}
of reconnaissance satellites is classified, it [[clearly
surpasses]{.underline}]{.mark} that available from [commercial
sources]{.underline}. n26 There is speculation, for example, that
[the]{.underline} \[\*1837\] [current spatial resolution of
reconnaissance satellites is **less than four inches**]{.underline}. n27
[By contrast, one of the most sophisticated commercial satellites is
only capable of capturing images at a resolution of sixteen
inches]{.underline}. n28 Further, due to concerns about security, U.S.
government regulations require that commercial vendors downgrade imagery
available to the public to a resolution of approximately twenty inches.
n29 While these differences in resolution may seem inconsequential, [the
[higher res]{.mark}olution of reconnaissance satellites [can be
**critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [in identifying
collapsed buildings or damaged infrastructure]{.underline}. n30 Beyond
the differences in resolution, [another benefit]{.underline} of using
reconnaissance imagery for disaster planning and response [is that it is
cost-free]{.underline} to the requesting organization. n31
[[Commercial]{.mark} satellite [imagery]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [[is]{.mark} very [expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Costs
vary widely depending on the vendor, the resolution and age of the
imagery, and the geographic extent of the imaged area. It is not
uncommon, however, to see prices in the range of \$ 8,000 per image for
current imagery from high-resolution sensors. n32 [Because activities
related to]{.underline} \[\*1838\] [disaster preparation and response
are often inadequately funded]{.underline}, this [[expense can be
**prohibitive**]{.underline}]{.mark} to those charged with such
missions. n33 To be sure, there are efforts underway, such as the
International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, n34 to combat this
problem. But while the Charter\'s aim is to provide free or low-cost
imagery to those affected by disasters, the reality is that its impact
is somewhat limited - at least insofar as U.S. contributions are
concerned - by the fact that the imagery donated at no-cost by U.S.
companies is archived rather than newly acquired. n35 For disaster
response, having up-to-date imagery is obviously vital to ascertaining
the extent of recent damage.

#### Causes [extinction]{.underline}.

With our intelligence we have littered the planet with massive spent
[[nuclear fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} pools, [emitting]{.underline}
**[lethal radiation]{.underline}** in over-crowded conditions, [with
circulation requirements of **electricity**]{.underline},
**[water]{.underline}**-supply, [and]{.underline} neutron [**absorbent
chemicals**. The [failure]{.mark} of]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}**
of these conditions for any calculable or incalculable reason, [will
[release]{.mark}]{.underline} all of [a pool's
**[cesium]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in[**to** the
**atmosphere**]{.mark}]{.underline}, causing 188 square miles to be
contaminated, 28,000 cancer deaths and \$59 billion in damage. As of
2003, 49,000 tons of SNF was stored at 131 sites with an additional
2,000-2,400 metric tons produced annually. The NRC has issued permits,
and the nuclear industry has amassed unfathomable waste on the premise
that a deep geological storage facility would be available to remediate
the waste. The current chances for a deep geological storage facility
look grim. The NAS has required geologic stability for 1,000,000 years.
It is impossible to calculate any certainty 1,000,000 years into the
future. Humanity could not even predict the mechanical failures at Three
Mile Island or Chernobyl, nor could it predict the size of the tsunami
that triggered three **[criticality]{.underline}** [events]{.underline}
at Fukushima Daiichi. These irremediable crises span just over 70 years
of human history.

How [can]{.underline} the continued production and maintenance of SNF in
pools [be]{.underline} anything but [a]{.underline}
**[precedent]{.underline}** [to [an **unprecedented human
cataclysm**]{.mark}]{.underline}? The Department of Energy's outreach
website explains nuclear fission for power production, providing a
timeline of the industry. The timeline ends, as does most of the world's
reactor construction projects in the 1990s, with the removal of the FCMs
from Three Mile Island. One would think the timeline would press into
the current decade, however the timeline terminates with the question,
"How can we minimize the risk? What do we do with the waste?" (The
History of Nuclear Energy 12). Nearly fifteen years into the future,
these questions are no closer to an answer. The reactors at Fukushima
Daiichi are still emitting radioisotopes into the atmosphere, and their
condition is unstable. TEPCO has estimated it could take forty years to
recover all of the fuel material, and there are doubts as to whether the
decontamination effort can withstand that much time (Schneider 72). A
detailed analysis of Chernobyl has demonstrated that [nuclear
fall-out]{.underline}, whether from thermonuclear explosions, spent fuel
pool fires, or reactor core criticality events [are [deleterious
to]{.mark} the **[food]{.mark}-chain**]{.underline}.
**[Cesium]{.underline}** and strontium [are taken into the **roots** of
**plants**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** crops,
[causing [direct]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[human]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[animal]{.underline}** [[contamination]{.mark} from
ingestion, causing cancer, teratogenicity, mutagenesis [and
death]{.mark}. Vegetation suffers mutagenesis, reproductive loss, and
death. Radioactive [fields and **forest**]{.mark} floor[**s**
**decimate** **invertebrate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[rodent variability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and number [necessary
to]{.mark} supply [nature's]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[food-chain]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[life
[cycles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The **flesh and bones**]{.underline}
[of freshwater and oceanic biota contribute significantly to the total
radiation dose in the food-chain. [Fresh **water**]{.mark}
**lakes**]{.underline}, **[rivers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[streams]{.underline}** [[become radioactive]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Potable **[aquafers]{.underline}** directly underlying SNFs and FCMs
[are penetrated by downward migration of radioisotopes]{.underline}.
**[Humans must eat to live. Humans must have water. [No human can
survive]{.mark} 5 Sv of exposure]{.underline}** to ionizing radiation,
many cannot survive exposure to 1 Sv.

Realizing the irremediable devastation caused by one thermonuclear
warhead, by one Chernobyl, by one Fukushima Daiichi, it remains to be
said that [the]{.underline} **[earth]{.underline}** [can handle as many
simultaneous loss of coolant failures as nature can create]{.underline}.
**[Humanity cannot]{.underline}**. It is not good enough to lead by
relegating probable human wide extinction phenomena to an appeal to lack
of evidence. [Policy]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}** indefinitely
**[ignore]{.underline}** responsibility by requiring further study. Nor
can leadership idle into **[cataclysm]{.underline}** by relying on the
largest known natural phenomena of the last 200 years. Permitting
construction and continued operation of malefic machinery, based on 200
years of cataclysmic experience is a protocol for calamity. Of coronal
mass ejections, Hapgood warns, that we need to prepare for a
once-in-1000-year event, not just simulate infrastructure safeties by
the measure of what we have seen in the past. The same is true for all
natural phenomena. The future of humanity is too precious to operate
with such insouciance. The engineering is not good enough. It never will
be. Nature is too unpredictable, and nuclear power is too dangerous.

### Add On\-\--Naval Readiness

#### Space assets are key to [Naval readiness]{.underline}\-\--awareness in space is [linked]{.underline} to [threat mitigation]{.underline} in international waters, else [Russian and Chinese aggression]{.underline}.

Jon **Harper, 21** (Jon Harper, 8-26-2021, accessed on 7-9-2022,
National Defense Magazine, \"SPACE SYMPOSIUM NEWS: Navy, Marines Gearing
Up for Space Warfare\",
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2021/8/26/navy-marines-gearing-up-for-space-warfare, HBisevac)

The [Navy is **highly dependent** on **space assets** for]{.underline}
everything from [situational awareness to communications to targeting
and positioning]{.underline}, [navigation and timing]{.underline}. [But
U.S. systems are **threatened** by]{.underline} potential enemies such
as [China and Russia]{.underline}, officials noted at the confab, which
was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

"Those [adversaries have **rapidly expanded**]{.underline} their
[national objectives to hold **at risk** our space
capabilities]{.underline}," said Rear Adm. Michael Bernacchi, director
of strategy, plans and policy J5 at U.S. Space Command. "[We have
observed them **test** and **deploy**]{.underline} direct ascent and
co-orbital **[anti-satellite weaponry]{.underline}**."

Orbital debris also poses dangers to spacecraft, he added.

"[Space is **absolutely** a place where the **Navy** is going to be
**fighting**]{.underline}," said Rear Adm. Gene Price, vice commander of
naval information forces.

Going forward, Bernacchi said commanding officers will have to focus
more on the space dimension of military operations.

"[They]{.underline}\'re going to [have to understand how]{.underline}
they\'re going [to]{.underline} have to [**protect** their
ships]{.underline}, their [crews]{.underline}, their
[submarines]{.underline}" [from **space**]{.underline}-**[related
threats]{.underline}**, he said. "[The enemy continues to build **very
capable systems**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} pretty [soon it will
be a matter of **self-defense from a space dimension**.]{.underline} And
that\'s just another thing that the commanding officer ... is going to
be responsible for. And so it will be our job to educate, train \[and\]
develop officers who can do that."

The service plans to leverage upgrades to its Aegis air-and-missile
defense systems to boost its space situational awareness capabilities.
The systems' sensors will help detect, characterize and counter
adversary offensive capabilities, he said.

"Over the next couple of years, both our ships and Aegis Ashore are
going to have those upgrades, which allow for independent space domain
capability, tracking of objects in the background, which doesn\'t take
away from any of its other capabilities," he said. "That is a huge
upgrade."

Over the coming years, there will be more than 30 ships equipped with
the technology, he noted.

In the future, the Navy could employ its own counter-space weapons,
Bernacchi suggested.

"If you\'re talking future systems --- jammers, reversible effects,
non-reversible effects, directed energy weapons, etc. ... \[deployed
on\] mobile platforms that move quickly and can be all over the world,
that significantly complicates an adversary's decision-making," he said.

"Imagine putting space-control capabilities ... on a submarine or
\[unmanned underwater vehicle\], and then the adversary is trying to
figure out where that\'s coming from," he added.

Price said space wasn't a high priority for the Navy during the
post-9/11 wars. But things have changed as concerns have grown about
high-tech peer competitors.

"Unfortunately, within the Navy, [space became a **backwater** for
awhile]{.underline}," Price said. But now, the service is "doubling
down" in many areas and "sprinting" to catch up.

A key focus going forward will be developing space expertise at all
levels, from combatant commands such as U.S. Space Command to the
tactical edge, officials said.

"There\'s a lot of demand signal and we don\'t have enough
\[space-focused personnel\], but we are running fast and we are catching
up quickly," Price said.

The Marine Corps also wants in on the action.

Marine Corps Forces Space Command was recently activated to support U.S.
Spacecom, the joint force and Fleet Marine Forces.

"It is currently a small footprint, but like in other domains, we hope
to punch well above our weight," said Maj. Gen. Ryan Heritage, commander
of MARFORSPACE. "It\'s a true recognition of what the fight tomorrow
will look like."

One of the biggest changes underway is the standardizing of space
billets within the Navy and the creation of the maritime space officer
designation, so that personnel are much better trained, Price noted.

In the past, "you would go to a space billet as an aviator or as a ship
driver or submariner or information warfare officer, and you would learn
space and then you would move on to another job within your community
and you might not ever touch space again," he said.

In the future, maritime space officers will be "doing space 24/7, 365"
days a year, Price added. "They\'re going to be getting some of the same
training that you\'ve been seeing Air Force space officers go through
for years and their career path has ... been defined, and they\'re going
to have lots of career opportunities that will enable them to stay for
the long haul."

[The development of new space capabilities through the requirements and
acquisition processes is another major area of focus for the sea
services.]{.underline}

\"It\'s key that \... we also have a corps of acquisition professionals
that understand system design, Navy operations and space capabilities,
so we can get the right mix of requirements into the right place at the
right time," said Rear Adm. Stephen Donald, reserve deputy commander for
10th Fleet. [**Failure** in this regard will result in the Navy **not
having capabilities** that it will **need** for **future
fights**]{.underline}, he said.

Introduction

[As a **maritime nation**, **[naval power]{.mark}** is the U.S.'s **most
useful** means of [respond]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} **distant
[crises]{.mark}**, preventing them from harming]{.underline} our
[security]{.underline} or that of our allies and partners, [[and
keep]{.mark}ing **geographically [remote]{.mark}** [threats from
**metastasizing**]{.mark} **into conflicts** that]{.underline} could
[approach our borders]{.underline}. A maritime defense demands a
maritime strategy. As national resources are increasingly strained the
need exists for a strategy that makes deliberate choices to connect ends
(security) with means (money and the fleet it builds). This paper
examines the need for a maritime strategy, discusses options, and offers
recommendations for policy makers.

[After]{.underline} several [decades of unchallenged **world
leadership**, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates once again [[faces]{.mark} **great power
[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, this time [[featuring]{.mark}
two]{.underline} other [world powers. [**China** and
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly [bristle [under]{.mark} the
[constraints of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**post-World War II systems**
of global **trade**, **finance**, and
**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} largely [created by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline},
systems that the United States has protected and sustained to the
economic and security benefit of its citizens and the citizens of other
nations. [Both China and Russia are]{.underline} demonstrably
[improving]{.underline} the [quality of their **armed forces**
while]{.underline} simultaneously [acting **aggressively** toward
neighboring countries]{.underline}, some of which are US treaty allies.
Additionally, [both]{.underline} nations [are turning their attention to
**naval operations** far from their]{.underline} own
[coasts]{.underline}, operations designed [to advance national
interests]{.underline} that are often [**in tension** with]{.underline}
those of [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.1

For the past several decades, [US]{.underline} national [security
strategy has not had to contend with **great powers**]{.underline}.
Instead, [it]{.underline} has [concerned itself]{.underline} primarily
[with **building alliances** designed to manage **regional
security**]{.underline} more efficiently [by proxy, while
devoting]{.underline} increasingly more [resources to homeland defense
and]{.underline} intelligence aimed at stemming acts of
[terror]{.underline} by Islamic radical organizations and their
followers. To the extent that the US position of leadership in the world
was not threatened, this strategy was reasonable, if imperfectly
pursued.

[Such a strategy will **no longer suffice** in a world of]{.underline}
great power [competition]{.underline}, especially one in which powers of
considerable---but unequal---strength are opposed. [**Unbalanced
[multi-polarity]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} an especially
**[[unstable]{.underline}]{.mark}** condition, [[and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
not]{.mark} **effectively [postured]{.mark}** to manage that
instability]{.underline}. Henry Kissinger divides the concept of world
order into two parts: a normative system that defines acceptable action,
and a 'balance of power' arrangement that punishes the breach of such
conventions2. [As the underlying **balance of forces** shifts,
[states]{.mark} with different ideas of **international order**
[gain]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[power to **reshape the
system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thucydides' ancient insight holds true --
[[the rise]{.mark} in power [of one]{.mark} actor **[threatens
all]{.mark} others**. Where]{.underline} such [threat exists and if the
balance of power]{.underline} between states or coalitions [approaches
equilibrium, a "**Cold War**"]{.underline} between competing ideological
camps [occurs]{.underline}.

[In an **unbalanced system**, the **stronger side** is tempted to
**strike its weaker opponent** while the balance of forces is favorable.
**Unbridled competition**]{.underline} for supremacy [defined Europe
during its bloodiest periods]{.underline}. Europe's 16th and 17th
century **[religious [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** between Catholics and
Protestants [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the global 20th century
[struggles between **[totalitarian ideologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
democracy both [[represent the]{.mark} **natural [end-state]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} unbalanced **[multipolar systems]{.mark}**. Without norms to
**restrain states** and force to **uphold**]{.underline} these
[**norms**, violence is]{.underline} very [likely]{.underline}.

[Today's international system is **moving toward**]{.underline}
unbalanced [multi-polarity]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not]{.underline} currently
[prepared to manage such an]{.underline} international [environment. If
Americans want to preserve their]{.underline} nation's secure and
prosperous [position as the **world's great power**, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must]{.underline} begin now to
[prepare]{.underline} strategically [for what it will inevitably face.
Otherwise, it will]{.underline} ultimately [be forced into]{.underline}
an **[increasingly limited]{.underline}** number of unattractive
[options to sustain]{.underline} its position of
[leadership]{.underline}.

There is little evidence that the people of the United States wish to
see our position in the world diminished. The 2016 Presidential Election
raised important questions about the degree to which globalization has
served the interests of everyday Americans (and their perceptions
thereof), while the two dominant US political parties have moved toward
more protectionist policies, at least as articulated by their nominees.
Opinion polling indicates the divided nature of the American public on
issues like free trade and sustained foreign commitments.3 However,
[[Americans]{.mark} **remain cognizant** of threats to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and [favor]{.mark}
**maintaining** America's position as a great power by **sustaining [a
strong military]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 Moreover, [[it would be
**difficult** to identify]{.underline}]{.mark} meaningful numbers of
[[Americans who]{.mark} would **[sacrifice]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}** in favor of]{.underline} increased [social
spending]{.underline}, despite the continuing rise in non-discretionary
spending in the federal budget. [Americans understand]{.underline} that
the US position of [world leadership benefits the]{.underline} nation's
[economy]{.underline}, its security, [its allies, and the international
order]{.underline} that has been the object of US foreign and defense
policy for over a century. [They know]{.underline} that [their lives
would be diminished if]{.underline} this position of [**global
leadership** were surrendered to an adversary]{.underline} or group of
them. The paradox of the American experience is that the US is not
simply a great power -- it is an exceptional power, for which ideals
count as much as strength. [The]{.underline} American [public, **despite
its aversion** to **foreign commitments**, can **rise to the occasion**
and respond to]{.underline} clear [threats]{.underline}, as it has in
both World Wars, the Cold War, and after September 11th. [The job of the
policymaker]{.underline}, therefore, [is to ensure America **remains a
great power**, so]{.underline} that when the occasion arises, [it can
act as an exceptional power]{.underline}.

[It is critical]{.underline} then, [for]{.underline} US political
[leaders to begin thinking]{.underline} more strategically
[about]{.underline} protecting and [[advancing **America\'s
position**]{.mark} in the face of]{.underline} growing [great power
competition]{.underline}. This monograph asserts that [a strategy to
support such]{.underline} a goal [[would]{.mark} **necessarily [be
maritime]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature, [[leveraging]{.mark} this
nation's]{.underline} great **[[geographic]{.mark}al
[advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the service of its national power.

[[Sharing]{.mark} **land [borders]{.mark}** with]{.underline} only [two
nations---both]{.underline} of whom are [friendly to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---[[and separated]{.mark} from
other]{.underline} great [powers [by]{.mark} **vast [oceans]{.mark}**[,
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [enjoys a
**security position**]{.underline} quite [unlike]{.underline} that of
[any other nation]{.underline}. For over a century, [it has been
the]{.underline} unspoken (but doggedly pursued) national security [aim
of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**no power** rise]{.mark} to
prominence [in **Asia** or **Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline} so as [to
occupy a position]{.underline} there [**as dominant** as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' position [in the Western
Hemisphere. Were this to occur, not only could [that]{.mark}
nation]{.underline} then **[[lock the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[out of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[resources and activity of [that region]{.mark}, but [it
could]{.mark}]{.underline} also then eventually [turn its attention to
**[challeng]{.mark}ing [our position]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
Western Hemisphere.5

Underlying this approach is the reality that [[most]{.mark} the world's
[activity does **not occur** in our]{.mark} **own [hemisphere]{.mark}**,
but in Asia and Europe. American interests in these
regions]{.underline}--- political, diplomatic, economic, and
military---[are considerable and **growing**. Protecting and
**sustaining**]{.underline} those [interests must remain a
priority]{.underline} of American policy, [and **maritime strategy** is
an effective tool]{.underline} in doing so.

[Maritime strategy is a **subset** of grand strategy]{.underline}, and
the relationship between the two is ably defined by Professor John B.
Hattendorf of the Naval War College:

> "In its broadest sense, [grand strategy is the **comprehensive
> direction** of power to achieve]{.underline} particular [national
> goals]{.underline}. Within those terms, [maritime strategy is the
> direction of **all aspects** of]{.underline} national [power that
> relate to]{.underline} a nation's [interests at sea]{.underline}. The
> navy serves this purpose, but maritime strategy is not purely a naval
> preserve. [Maritime strategy]{.underline} involves the other functions
> of state power that [include **diplomacy**]{.underline}; the safety
> and defence of merchant trade at sea; fishing; the exploitation,
> conservation, regulation and defence of the exclusive economic zone at
> sea; coastal defence; security of national borders; the protection of
> offshore islands; as well as participation in regional and world-wide
> concerns relating to the use of oceans, the skies over the oceans and
> the land under the seas.6

[[It is]{.mark} **wholly [appropriate]{.mark}** [for the world's]{.mark}
**dominant [naval power]{.mark}**---separated from its]{.underline}
widely-[**flung interests** by]{.underline} thousands of [miles
of]{.underline} open [ocean---[to develop]{.mark}]{.underline} and
execute [**coherent [maritime strategy]{.mark}**. In a time of
re-emerging]{.underline} great power [competition, it is **essential**.
[The]{.mark} nation's **[current]{.mark}** maritime
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} 7 [is]{.underline}, unfortunately, [not
up to the task. It [focuses **insufficiently** on]{.mark} great power
[competition]{.mark}; it [does **not recognize**]{.mark}
the]{.underline} rise in [importance of [**conventional** forces]{.mark}
in deterring great power war; it does not provide a **theory
of**]{.underline} conventional **[deterrence]{.underline}** appropriate
[to great powers]{.underline} and their likely objectives; [it [does not
suggest a **posture**]{.mark} for **naval forces** [that acts as
a]{.mark}n **effective [deterrent]{.mark}**[; its]{.mark}]{.underline}
derived [force [structure is]{.mark} **too [small]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and short [on]{.underline} effective [logistic support; it [does
not]{.mark} place]{.underline} sufficient [[value]{.mark} on **naval
[partnerships]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **geographically
[important]{.mark}** [nations]{.mark}]{.underline} which may not be
traditional partners; and it is silent on the need for the nation to
invest in a maritime industrial base that can enable an appropriate
strategy.

This monograph urges new thinking about [maritime strategy]{.underline},
a strategy compatible with the United States' responsibilities as the
leader of the free world, as well as the world's premier political,
military, economic, and diplomatic power. Such a strategy
[would]{.underline} seek to [protect and sustain]{.underline} those
[**leadership positions** in the face of renewed]{.underline} great
power [competition]{.underline}, [competition that]{.underline} largely
[**subsumes** other]{.underline}, lesser [security
concerns]{.underline}. There will be those who view this approach as a
return to "Cold War" strategic thinking, and we do not shy from this
comparison. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates acted for decades as a coherent strategic
actor when faced with expansionist Soviet totalitarianism, and it [[must
act with]{.mark} equal coherence and [**resolve** to **contest**]{.mark}
**China** and **Russia's**]{.underline} brands of [aggressive
**mercantilism**, **regional expansion**, and [**contempt** for]{.mark}
established **global [order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There will be those who evaluate our suggestions in this paper and
conclude that the nation cannot afford it, that the expense associated
with moving to a maritime grand strategy would imbalance the traditional
"ends, ways, means" approach to the making of strategy. And while the
ends, ways, means approach is generally relevant to military and
operational strategy, it is unsuited to the making of grand strategy for
one very important reason. Unlike subordinate levels of strategy, grand
strategy re-allocates, realigns, and re-orients a nation's "means" to
serve strategic "ends". Military strategy starts with the proposition
that there is a certain resource level available to pursue its ends.
Grand strategy starts with the sum of the nation's output capacity, and
then determines how it can most effectively be allocated to the
achievement of strategic goals.

Short of war itself, there is nothing in American history that causes
strategic realignment more reliably than a change in Administration, and
we wish to be part of that dialogue. [We argue]{.underline} here [for a
new **theory of deterrence**, one that revises the]{.underline} Cold War
[approach in which the Soviet Union was deterred from **large-scale
conventional attack** by the threat of **nuclear
escalation**]{.underline}. Under that rubric, one could justifiably say
that America's conventional deterrent was dependent on its strategic
deterrent. Today, [the decapitating "**bolt from the blue**" strike is
**even more** remote]{.underline} than it was in the Cold War,
[and]{.underline} to the extent that [nuclear exchange]{.underline}
between great powers is conceivable, it [is far more likely to flow from
conventional conflict]{.underline} that has gone awry. Therefore, [to
deter nuclear war, we must deter conventional war. [**No aspect**
of]{.mark} American military [power will be **more critical** to
deter]{.mark}ring]{.underline} either [**[nuclear]{.mark}** or
conventional **super-power [war]{.mark}** than seapower]{.underline}.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} profoundly [reliant
on]{.mark} the ability to use [space]{.mark} for its
security]{.underline}. Though little appreciated outside of professional
and expert circles, space -- or, more precisely, [U.S. [assets
in]{.mark} and using [space]{.mark}]{.underline} **[-- [are vital
to]{.mark} U.S. [defense and intelligence]{.mark}
communications]{.underline}** with and among national leaders, military
forces, and others; **[[c]{.mark}ommand [and]{.mark}
[c]{.mark}ontrol]{.underline}**; positioning, navigation, and timing
(**[[PNT]{.underline}]{.mark}**); intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (**[[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**); and a host of other
functions. While these may seem rather like "back office" functions to a
lay reader, [they are actually the stuff of which American global
military primacy is made. [The U.S. military]{.mark}]{.underline} is not
currently superior to its potential adversaries because it has stronger
soldiers, bigger guns, or more tanks. Rather, it **[[has the upper hand
because it can understand]{.mark} better [what is taking place in the
midst of conflict]{.mark}, what its own forces are doing, and what those
of an enemy are doing amidst the "fog of war."]{.underline}**2 [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can]{.mark} therefore [employ
force]{.mark} around the globe more rapidly, more precisely, and more
intelligently -- and thus [more effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}.3
Together, **[[this]{.mark} "smarter" and more agile U.S. [military
is]{.mark} therefore uniquely [capable of applying decisive power
against an adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}4 [Exploitation of
[space is]{.mark} particularly [critical to effective U.S. power
projection]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[as it provides the U.S. military
with the ability to operate effectively over global distances, beyond
the reach of what U.S. ground-based and aerial assets, limited by range
and endurance, can provide.]{.underline}** As General John Hyten,
Commander of U.S. Air Force Space Command, recently said on CBS' 60
Minutes, because of space ["we can attack any target on the planet,
anytime, anywhere, in any weather."]{.underline}5 Thus [[Washington's
ability to project credible]{.mark} and effective [military power
to]{.mark} key regions such as [the]{.mark} Western [Pacific, Europe,
and the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which is elemental to the
U.S. national security strategy of forward engagement -- **[relies on
space. And [this reliance is increasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, while [space is crucial for]{.underline} U.S. power
projection and an effective military posture in key regions, it [is also
vital for crucial homeland defense and deterrence
functions]{.underline}. **[[Space]{.mark}-based [assets provide early
warning of missile attacks]{.mark} against the United States (and
others) [and serve as a crucial component in]{.mark} the [command and
control system for]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear forces]{.mark} in the event of
war -- including a nuclear war.]{.underline}**6 As the 2011 U.S.
National Security Space Strategy, a document bearing the signatures of
the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence,
summarized, [["\[s\]pace capabilities provide]{.mark} the United States
and [our allies unprecedented advantages]{.mark} ... create a decision
advantage ... \[and are\] [vital to monitoring strategic and military
developments]{.mark} ... [Maintaining]{.mark} the benefits afforded to
the United States by [space is central]{.mark} [to]{.mark} our [national
security]{.mark}."]{.underline}7 [Space, then, is [vital for]{.mark}
America's [military preeminence]{.mark} and the national strategy it
underwrites. But this reliance is becoming increasingly
problematic]{.underline}. [This is because potential U.S. **[adversaries
have noticed the degree of U.S. reliance on its space
architecture]{.mark}** and the advantages that the United States has
accrued from it [and have been]{.mark} assiduously [working to]{.mark}
find ways to [threaten]{.mark} U.S. [space]{.mark}]{.underline} and
space-related [[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, many observers
have noted that [[these]{.mark} potential [opponents judge]{.mark} the
U.S. [space architecture to be the "Achilles' heel" of U.S. military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}, in light of the depth of American reliance
on these systems and the vulnerability of the U.S. satellite
architecture.8 As General Hyten put it, [without access to space the
U.S. military would be a greatly reduced force.]{.underline} As he put
it, **[[in such a circumstance the]{.mark} U.S. [military would return
to a model of "World War II"]{.mark} or "industrial age"
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**.9 Nor is this merely a peril for the
future. Rather, [after many years in which this problem seemed safely
ensconced over a distant horizon, it is now coming increasingly into
view that threats to U.S. space assets are real and
pressing]{.underline} -- and indeed are likely to worsen, probably
significantly.10 Countries like [[Russia, China]{.underline}]{.mark},
and even nations with more modest capabilities and resources [[are
gaining the ability to hold]{.mark} U.S. [satellites at risk]{.mark} not
only through kinetic direct-attack methods]{.underline} such as
anti-satellite (ASAT) missiles, [but also through non-kinetic and more
limitable techniques such as jamming, "dazzling," cyber and other
electronic attack]{.underline}, and other novel methods.11 Some of these
approaches can destroy or disable satellites, whereas others offer the
option of blinding or otherwise interfering with the effective
functioning of space assets.12 [[The result is that]{.mark} the U.S.
[space architecture is]{.mark} becoming [increasingly
vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}, with U.S. satellites in low Earth orbit
already targetable by a nation such as China and with U.S. satellites in
deeper space very likely to become similarly exposed soon.13 China's
2007 destruction of a satellite in low Earth orbit demonstrated its
ability to hit satellites at that range.14 And its 2013 test of an
anti-satellite weapon reportedly propelled a missile approximately
18,600 miles into space, just shy of the 22,236 miles at which U.S.
satellites in geosynchronous orbit -- including essential missile
warning and communications satellites -- are located.15 As Air Force
Lieutenant General John Raymond, then the Commander of the 14th Air
Force and the Joint Functional Component Command for Space for Strategic
Command, testified in March 2015: "We are quickly approaching the point
where every satellite in every orbit can be threatened."16 In sum,
[then, the United States is highly reliant on its space architecture for
the full range of military operations -- and that architecture is
vulnerable and becoming more so.]{.underline}

### Add On\-\--Wildfires

#### Domain awareness is key to preventing [rouge wildfires]{.underline}.

Alicia Victoria **Lozano, 21** (Alicia Victoria Lozano is a reporter for
NBC News focusing on climate change and wildfires, 7-24-2021, accessed
on 7-9-2022, NBC, \"Using satellites and AI, space-based technology is
shaping the future of firefighting\",

Using [satellites]{.underline}, drones and artificial intelligence,
emerging technology is [changing the way **firefighting**]{.underline}
agencies and governments [battle the **ever-increasing threat of
wildfires**]{.underline} as hundreds of thousands of acres burn across
the western United States.

New programs are being developed by startups and research institutions
to predict fire behavior, monitor drought and even detect fires when
they first start. As climate change continues to increase the intensity
and frequency of wildfires, these breakthroughs offer at least one tool
in the growing arsenal of prevention and suppression strategies.

"This is not to replace firefighting on the ground," said Ilkay
Altintas, a computer scientist with the University of California, San
Diego, who developed a fire map for the region. "[The more **science**
and **data** we can give firefighters]{.underline} and the public, [the
**quicker** we'll have **solutions** to combat and mitigate
**wildfires**]{.underline}."

More than 80 large fires and complexes have scorched more than 1.3
million acres across 13 states this year as of Friday, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center, and additional fires are breaking out
almost every week. The country's largest inferno, the Bootleg Fire in
southern Oregon, has forced thousands of residents to evacuate since
lightning sparked it July 6. Smoke from the Western blazes is so thick
that East Coast residents were treated this week to a spectacular, if
worrisome, fiery sunrise and hazy skies.

"[As the risk for **catastrophic wildfire** grows]{.underline}, [so
should our **ability** to **forecast wildfires** and to **mitigate fire
risk**]{.underline}," Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said last month during
a House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology hearing.

#### Extinction.

Climate change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a
result of higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. The
expectation is that [[forest fires will become more **frequent and
severe**]{.underline}]{.mark} with climate warming and drought (Scholze,
Knorr, Arnell, & Prentice, 2006), a trend for which we have already seen
evidence (Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, [the [increased severity and
risk of]{.mark} Southern [California]{.mark} [wildfires]{.mark} recently
predicted by climate scientists]{.underline} (Jin et al., 2015), was
realized in December 2017, with the largest fire in the history of
California (the "Thomas fire" that burned 282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/
thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire). [This [catastrophic fire
embodies ]{.mark}]{.underline}the sorts of [[**positive feedbacks** and
**interacting factors** that could catch humanity off-guard and produce
a **true apocalyptic event**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Record-breaking rains
produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried out
as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger
than normal winds, and ignition. Of course [[the record-fire released
CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future
warming]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A weak European military

[European **defense spending**]{.underline}, specifically [related to
**nations falling short**]{.underline} of the NATO 2% of GDP target,
[has been a **major issue**]{.underline} [in U.S.-EU
relations]{.underline}. While Barack Obama's administration exerted
diplomatic pressure, Donald Trump's engaged in open confrontation on
this issue. Neither administration obtained significant results,
however; and [as Afghanistan has shown]{.underline}, [Europe is **still
far too reliant**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [military
**protection** of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates --- [an issue]{.underline} [that
**weakens**]{.underline} [NATO's **posture**]{.underline}. Over the past
few years, the EU has strengthened both its legal and financial
mechanisms to be more competitive on the security side. In December
2017, under articles 42.6 and 46 of the Lisbon Treaty, the European
Council established a Permanent Structured Cooperation mechanism to
deepen cooperation between willing member states. These states have
agreed to binding commitments on investment, planning and management to
advance their defense capabilities in the service of both national and
multinational operations (including those of NATO and the UN). PESCO
currently has 46 projects in several domains, from training to maritime
and land exercises to cyber and military mobility.33 Through the
European Defense Fund, the EU also has allocated 7.9 billion euros
(roughly \$9 billion) for the 2021-2027 period to research innovative
defense products and technologies through collaborate development
projects.34

[But while these]{.underline} initiatives [represent a step toward
better]{.underline} European [coordination]{.underline} on defense
issues, [they are]{.underline} completely [reliant on political
will]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [inter-governmental]{.underline}
[coordination]{.underline} --- as security is not a competence of the EU
but an inalienable prerogative of its member states. In fact, many of
the PESCO projects appear to be severely delayed.35

U.S. experts interviewed for this research also point out the bad shape
of European defense and more broadly its dependence on the United States
for even more reachable defense objectives. A report from the Center for
American Progress mentions the example of France's anti-terrorism
operation in the Sahel, where the U.S. ended up supporting basic
air-refueling and surveillance flights.36 A detailed study by the
Clingendael Institute points out that if the EU wants to be a credible
actor in crisis management, primarily in its neighborhood, then it
should be able to operate crossspectrum in the air, land, sea,
cyberspace, and space domains --- which cannot be done without more
serious investments in European defense.37 The case of Afghanistan ---
where Europeans decided to leave after the U.S. withdrawal despite the
predictable consequences on migration and political instability ---
offers a concrete example of such shortcomings.38 As Brookings expert
Michael E. O'Hanlon points out, Afghanistan operations did not require
high-tech equipment or massive resources; but the fact that European
countries involved in NATO operations in Afghanistan did not step up to
preserve a military presence in a crucial theater for European security
speaks to their unpreparedness in terms of stockpiles of equipment and
inability to conduct such operations without the help of the United
States.39 Germany's defense capabilities are also emblematic: Despite
having more fiscal leeway and being at the forefront of European
technological innovation, Berlin has not invested in its military, which
still lacks critical equipment such as body armor, night vision gear,
and helicopter spare parts.40 In this regard, evidence suggests that
integrating and strengthening European defense would undoubtedly offer
more openings for specialization, boost resource allocation and more
broadly improve readiness. Yet such opportunities are highly contingent
on building trust between allies and increasing political will, which
will inevitably take time and be achieved in different ways.

Recently, some inter-governmental initiatives outside of the EU and NATO
frameworks were taken to tackle these shortcomings. In 2018, French
President Emmanuel Macron launched the European Intervention Initiative
(E2I) with the aim of deepening military cooperation between like-minded
European governments sharing a strategic culture. Through intelligence
sharing, scenario planning, joint planning and exercises, its 13
participants are working to strengthen their military cooperation so
that they can offer rapid responses in case of a crisis. The E2I is
particularly relevant because one of its members is the United Kingdom,
which is not currently part of any PESCO projects.

The U.K's involvement signals the importance of the relationship and
responsibilities that the it shares with European partners on security.
While limited, [the initiative is an example]{.underline} [of
how]{.underline} [Europe and the U.K.]{.underline} [can]{.underline}
[strengthen]{.underline} their [security cooperation]{.underline}. As
the U.K. has left the EU, stronger defense cooperation between the U.K.
and the EU would also positively impact NATO through fostering synergies
and interoperability. [However, while]{.underline} [**relevant**, these
**initiatives are insufficient**]{.underline} [for Europe to play
a]{.underline} **[credible role]{.underline}** [as a security
actor]{.underline} in its eastern and southern neighborhoods. [And
such]{.underline} [**weaknesses** endanger]{.underline} [the
**deterrence power**]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} NATO
[alliance]{.underline} [against **Russia**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} ultimately [reduce the opportunities]{.underline} [for
the **EU more broadly** to defend]{.underline} [its]{.underline}
security **[interests]{.underline}**.

**[Complicating]{.underline}** matters **[further]{.underline}**, as
described above, the two organizations' [**activities** have **started
to overlap**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}
[embracing **capacity-building**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[cyber]{.underline} **[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}** [and
the EU]{.underline} [stepping up on]{.underline} **[crisis
management]{.underline}**. More recently, during preparation of its
strategic concept, NATO has been questioning its role in the fight
against climate change and in countering China's multifaceted influence
in the trans-Atlantic space. And following the AUKUS deal, the EU has
been reflecting on developing a stronger military to be able to respond
to crises directly impacting its security. [NATO]{.underline}
[**opposes** any]{.underline} **[form of duplication]{.underline}**,
[from command to resources]{.underline}, which is quite telling in terms
of its soul-searching for the definition of its objectives and its range
of action vis-à-vis global challenges.28

Recent events in Afghanistan offer a very good opportunity to reflect on
the role of NATO and EU aspirations. After the Taliban took back Kabul,
NATO called for an assessment of the accomplishments and failures of
ISAF and Resolute Support.29 But instead the EU --- not directly
involved in Afghanistan as an organization but rather through individual
member states --- and the United Kingdom reflected on their excessive
dependence on the United States in areas of paramount importance to
European security. As evacuation operations started in Kabul, with
devastating images traveling around the world, Borrell defined
Afghanistan as a "wake-up call" for the strengthening of European
defense.30 Allies complained about the United States' lack of
coordination and communication on the withdrawal, its unwillingness to
extend the deadline for evacuations. For its part, the United Nation
Security Council rejected a French-U.K. proposal to establish of a
U.N.-controlled safe zone around the Kabul airport.31 While it is
debatable whether or not the EU would have used its hypothetical army to
secure Kabul's airport, the Afghanistan experience exposed Europeans'
vivid vulnerabilities in the security domain and their dependence on the
U.S. military's logistical and technological capabilities.

In short, while NATO is rethinking its military engagement and
reflecting more on capacity building and missed opportunities in the
diplomatic field, the EU is reflecting on its military power.
Interestingly, [this **simultaneous chasm**]{.underline} [and
**overlap**]{.underline} between the two organizations' activities and
projections [is]{.underline} [yet **another sign**]{.underline} of two
major needs: First, the West needs to strengthen both its military and
non-military tools, and second, there must be more coordination between
the U.S. and Europe and by extension between NATO and the EU. These
[improvements will be **essential**]{.underline} [to prevent **malign
actors**]{.underline} [from taking]{.underline} [**advantage of security
crises** against the West]{.underline}. [China and Russia]{.underline},
for example, [have **already seized**]{.underline} the opportunity that
[Afghanistan]{.underline} [offers to **double down**]{.underline} [on
their]{.underline} anti-Western **[propaganda]{.underline}**. Both
Moscow and Beijing immediately sought to establish contacts with the
Taliban and will likely try to exert more power through their economic
influence and other means; eventually they may gain leverage by tapping
into Afghanistan's rare earth reserves32 or potentially by meddling with
migration flows to put pressure on Europe.

Limited communication channels

[Although]{.underline} personnel [**exchanges** and **joint
exercises**]{.underline} [have helped to]{.underline} [set up a
**framework**]{.underline} and a mindset for more integrated operations,
[officials]{.underline} interviewed for this paper under the condition
of anonymity [pointed out that information]{.underline}
[sharing]{.underline} and the results achieved [have been **very
limited**]{.underline}. [The **lack** of a **secure
communication**]{.underline} [system]{.underline} [to **share
information**]{.underline} between [the two organizations]{.underline}
[**severely hinders** their ability to work]{.underline} [together on a
**daily basis**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} most
[importantly]{.underline} [to **coordinate**]{.underline} in a real
[crisis]{.underline} scenario and consequently to put in place a joint
response. As of now, there is no direct inter-institutional secure lines
of communication between the EU and NATO. All communications take place
between each member state and either within NATO or within the EU.
[This]{.underline} also [is]{.underline} particularly
**[relevant]{.underline}** [when it comes to]{.underline} **[sharing
best practices]{.underline}** [or **handing over** tasks]{.underline}
from one organization to the other.25

Political tensions and different strategic priorities

Adding to this communication difficulty, **[political
tensions]{.underline}** [have **multiplied**]{.underline} within both
NATO and the EU, **[triggering]{.underline}** a climate of [**distrust**
that prevents]{.underline} **[intel]{.underline}**ligence
**[sharing]{.underline}**. Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400
surface-to-air missiles26 and its invasion of northern Syria after U.S.
troops withdrew raised security concerns in the alliance, while the
Northern Cyprus question and Ankara's activities in the eastern
Mediterranean waters have created tensions with Greece.27 Relations
between France and the U.K. have also significantly worsened since the
AUKUS deal, which could ultimately impact the functioning of NATO.

### Counterplans\-\--AT: EU\-\--Fails

#### EU's space sector lacks the [funds]{.underline} necessary and can't [compare]{.underline} to [U.S industries]{.underline}.

Concini; Senior Advisor in Advisory Services at European Investment
Bank, Jaroslav Toth; Senior Investment Advisor at European Investment
Bank, 2019, accessed on 7-7-20222, Europe Commission, "The future of the
European space sector",

HBisevac)

4.1. The [European space sector experiences]{.underline} similar
**[funding hurdles]{.underline}** to other tech companies, [particularly
during the **scale-up phase**]{.underline}

European space start-ups, despite their unique features, are subject to
the same macroeconomic dynamics and trends as their peers in other
industries. Although the EU is fertile ground for scientific research,
technology and innovation, Europ[ean start-ups are struggling to reach
the same **maturity levels** as their **American
counterparts**]{.underline}. As of 2016, [Europe]{.underline} had
[produced only 26]{.underline} "***[unicorns]{.underline}***" (i.e.
start-up companies with a market valuation over USD 1 billion),
[compared with **109** in the **US**]{.underline} and 59 in China.90

The financial and sovereign debt crises across the globe have
contributed to a suboptimal investment climate since 2008.91 Since this
period, [SMEs and start-ups]{.underline}, the [backbone of the European
economy]{.underline}, have [become **especially topical**]{.underline}.
In a report on the public consultation that preceded the EC's Start-up
and Scale-up Initiative, 71% of the respondents identified access to
finance as the major barrier to European start-ups scaling up their
business.92 Indeed, [despite other hurdles]{.underline}, [such as
**excessive bureaucracy**]{.underline}, [**risk aversion** or **high
compliance costs**]{.underline} with regard to employment and tax
regulations, the [growth of European start-ups']{.underline} is [mainly
**constrained** by the **funding gap** between]{.underline} their [needs
and the **availability**]{.underline} and accessibility [of
**funds**]{.underline}.93 & 94

The [space sector]{.underline} companies surveyed **[reaffirmed
this]{.underline}** hypothesis; whe[n asked about their view on access
to finance for the European space sector]{.underline} in general, [their
perception remained **quite negative**]{.underline} (Figure 45, even
though they perceived their own access to finance as quite positive, see
Figure 44).

Start-ups' funding needs depend on their maturity (Figure 46).
Enterprises in the early stage are generally cash-flow negative without
any sizeable track record, and therefore require a high risk tolerance
from potential investors, typically venture capitalists. In addition,
the high issuance and compliance costs, legal fees and administrative
requirements lower the accessibility of public equity capital. As a
result, IPOs are not an ideal scenario for European early stage
companies. Between 2000 and 2008, there was an annual average of 200
small IPOs, counting for 8 % of the total number of IPOs. After 2009,
these figures dropped to an average of 120 IPOs and 5 %, respectively.95

At the same time, bank loans are difficult to obtain for early stage
start-ups. Deutsche Bank Research even observed a considerable
deterioration in bank loan and credit line availability between 2010 and
2015 for SMEs that are less than two years old.96 This is due to the
perceived lack of transparency in the evaluation of their credit risk,
but also the strengthened balance sheet requirements for banks,
accompanied by prudent risk and capital management. The EU addressed
this by implementing an SME Supporting Factor (SF), reducing banks'
capital requirements for credit risk on exposures to SMEs, but research
has shown that micro/small firms were not able to benefit from this
measure.97

As a consequence, early stage start-ups resort to alternative financing
solutions. These include internal financing (family, friends, fools),
crowdfunding, business angels or VC. In particular, VC funds, which
focus on investments in early-stage start-ups with growth potential, are
often the only option for these enterprises. The European VC market is,
however, lagging the United States, whose market is deeper and more
developed, as exemplified by Figure 47. In the 2016 public consultation
on the EC's Start-up and Scale-up Initiative, stakeholders suggested
that "the lack of scale of EU-based venture capital funds is a
significant issue for companies attempting to scale up".99 Despite the
exceptional growth rates of European VC money over the last 10 years,
supported by a significant capital inflow from the US and Asia, the
[absolute amount of **v**enture **c**apital **funding** in Europe has
remained **low**]{.underline}.100 The demand for equity risk financing
among Europe's SMEs and mid-caps considerably exceeds the available
supply, with an estimated annual gap of up to EUR 70 billion (recent
estimates suggest annual EU-based demand between EUR 50 billion and EUR
80 billion and place supply at approximately EUR 11.5 billion).101 As
the space industry accounted for approximately 2.4 % of the global
investments in 2017,102 and the EU accounted for 10.7 % of the global
investments,103 we can deduce [the annual gap in the European space
industry]{.underline} is between [EUR]{.underline} 0.9 billion and
**[1.6 billion]{.underline}**.

Promising [European start-ups]{.underline} consequently [face a
**trade-off** between **cutting growth** and **reducing
expenses**]{.underline}, an early IPO or acquisition (the average
mergers and acquisitions (M&A) valuation in Europe is significantly
lower than in the US) or moving to better VC ecosystems such as the US,
which is what many eventually do.104 The reasons for this impasse are
manifold.

First, [Europe's less developed VC-landscape]{.underline} may be [rooted
in the **risk-averse mindset** of its **investment
culture**]{.underline}. As mentioned before, early stage start-ups
require a high risk tolerance from their investors due to their
opaqueness, limited track-record and a high degree of technological,
regulatory or market risk. This is especially the case for hardware
technology start-ups or those targeting emerging but immature markets,
and is [particularly applicable to space start-ups]{.underline}, as
confirmed by the respondents in our interviews. The public consultation
under the Start-up and Scale-up Initiative supports this
view---respondents advocated a cultural change by banks and financial
institutions concerning access to finance for bankrupt entrepreneurs
looking for a second chance, who currently maintain a negative credit
score for a long time.105

#### Legal and VC fund barriers wreck EU industries.

Third, [the **regulations**]{.underline}, [**terms and conditions** for
**investment** are **not standardised** across]{.underline} the
different [Member States]{.underline}, [creating a hurdle and
**compromising** the **potential** for]{.underline} upscaled,
[EU]{.underline}-wide venture capitalists [to **develop**]{.underline}.
In the public consultation under the Start-Up and Scale-Up Initiative,
40 % of [entrepreneurs reported that scaling up their
company]{.underline} across borders [was **harder than expected** due to
**legal**]{.underline}, [**regulatory** and **administrative
barriers**]{.underline}. Some respondents stated that Member States'
national legislation and tax regimes concerning investment, stock
options, profits and company structure hinder the optimal use of
cross-border VC within the European Union.113

However, early stage start-ups are not the only beneficiaries from VC.
[Enterprises in their growth stage]{.underline}, who have generated
their first revenues and built up a certain customer base, [need to
scale up and require capital]{.underline} to do so. In Europe, such
growth capital is particularly hard to find compared with seed or
early-stage capital. 65 % of the respondents in the public consultation
for the Start-Up and Scale-Up Initiative [indicated that **financing
hurdles** were the **main barrier** to their **scale-up
process**]{.underline}.115 This perception is endorsed by a letter from
18 European CEOs, who called on the EC to support start-ups in their
growth phase, rather than supporting innovators. According to the
entrepreneurs behind the initiative, later stage growth financing,
including access to IPOs and investments from pension funds and
sovereign wealth funds, should be improved, while EU money should be
given to venture capital funds, which are better placed to select
companies to back.116 & 117 The apparent [lack of growth
capital]{.underline} is shown in Figure 48, [where the percentage of
**growth stage deals** is **considerably higher** in the **US** than in
the **EU**]{.underline}, [which is a result of the **limited scale** and
**capacity** of European VC funds]{.underline} as discussed above.118

Furthermore, the [mobility of]{.underline} individual [professionals
between entrepreneurship]{.underline}, [corporate and investment roles
is **more limited** in **Europe** than in the]{.underline} **U**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [due to its **younger VC industry** and the
**constrained exit opportunities** for entrepreneurs]{.underline}.
Facilitating this triangle between investment, corporate and start-up
could open up new funding opportunities for start-ups in their growth
stage, as entrepreneurs who exited can take the role of business angels
or develop their own VC funds. It may also allow easier interactions
between start-ups and corporates, with an increased understanding of
each other's business culture and functioning (e.g. decision-making
processes).

### Counterplans\-\--AT: Turkey PIC\-\--Deficit

#### Turkey is [key]{.underline} for space [deterrence]{.underline}.

A step forward

[[**Ankara\'s** proper]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitical
[**[positioning]{.mark}** and foreign]{.underline} and security
[policies]{.underline} [lie behind those **achievements**]{.underline}.
[Turkey]{.underline} has [**managed** to step out of the Atlantic
system]{.underline}, [**meet the U.S.** on **equal
footing**]{.underline} and [[upgrade its]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**geopolitical [position]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} regional
or global players such as Iran, [[Russia, and China]{.underline}]{.mark}
to become an important regional actor.

[[However]{.underline}, [for]{.underline}]{.mark} further and **[lasting
[success]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[Turkey]{.underline}
[must]{.underline}]{.mark} [now **grow out of itself**]{.underline},
[[strengthen]{.underline} [its]{.underline}]{.mark} **[regional
[alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**, reaffirm its economy and trade
volume, [[fully]{.mark} **[achieve]{.mark}** its]{.underline}
technological and **[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** independence and
come to [[terms]{.underline}]{.mark} with itself and its history.

For a robust foreign policy and a thriving international appearance, it
is time to settle all internal disputes and reconcile with Turkish
history. The National Space Program is here to be able to accomplish all
of this.

First, the space program is fascinating to the entire younger generation
-- regardless of their political views -- as Turkish people are
intrinsically enthusiastic about space exploration.

Secondly, new career prospects are now opening up for young Turks as the
once \"American dream\" for space is now becoming a reality.

The program builds on the findings of early Turkish astronomers and
space researchers such as Farghani in the Middle Ages, whom Erdoğan had
presented at the program\'s ceremony.

The aim is to further develop their achievements. That can maybe be
achieved with inspiring stories of Turkish space researchers such as
Arsev Eraslan (with the help of whom the Apollo 11 mission could be
completed) or the Özmen-couple, who runs a space corporation named the
Sierra Nevada.

Meanwhile, the National Space Program also fulfills the wish of founding
leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who once said \"the future is in the
skies,\" to pursue sky and space exploration. That may help bring
together conservative and Kemalist circles in the country.

The program is also expected to create new faculties and increase human
capital with incentives being a pull factor for a highly qualified
workforce. This, in turn, will go along Turkey\'s expanding technical
capability in space and military areas, which go hand in hand, as NASA
has shown us.

Regional perspectives

Furthermore, Turkey will draw on other states\' existing know-how and
install a launchpad for its rockets in an alliance state near the
equator.

Agreements are to be signed with Russia, China, the U.S. and other
countries to enable joint space missions and exploration and
space-related joint production.

Turkey will reaffirm its regional cooperation with countries vital to
it.

The mutual exchange of technology will enable Ankara to meet the same
states on an equal footing. The partnership will strengthen Turkey\'s
geopolitical position since joint and close collaboration in such an
essential and expensive research field will influence all participating
states in their political decisions.

Similarly, the production of high-tech satellites will open up new
markets for Turkey both at home and abroad as numerous procurement and
sales markets will emerge and as many developing and allied countries
will rely on Turkish products.

There will be an overall windfall profit that will increase Turkey\'s
gross domestic product (GDP) and its foreign trade volume and strengthen
its geopolitical position further.

States hostile to Turkey will be deterred by Ankara\'s foreign policy
and economic potential and its allies such as Azerbaijan which will
likely buy these products just as it had bought Turkish drones that
played an essential role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

As a consequence, the program will provide Turkey with a geopolitical
counterweight to regional alliances such as those of Greece, Israel and
Greek Cyprus, which, with the help of the West, seek to corner Ankara in
the Eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean, northern Syria, Iraq and even
western Thrace.

In addition, the bilateral relations with the European Union will also
change as a new balance will be established in the accession
negotiations and trade relations.

The core aim

Most importantly, Turkey will complete its independence movement in its
security policy and defense industry.

[By]{.underline} **[exploring space]{.underline}**,
[[Ankara]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [wants to **gain
knowledge**]{.underline} of [military]{.underline} engineering
[systems]{.underline} but also plans to build GPS satellites and send
them into the atmosphere.

Consequently, Turkey [[would be able to use these]{.underline}
**[satellites]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[intel]{.underline}]{.mark}**ligence, civil [[and
**military**]{.mark} **purposes**]{.underline} [such as]{.underline}
conducting **[[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** without being
hacked, militarily tracked or without Ankara having to rely on
information from U.S. GPS networks.

If Turkey succeeds in this, it will soon be able to compete with global
players. Likewise, it will then be able to consistently defend all the
rights to which it is internationally entitled in the region and
effectively combat terrorism in and around Turkey.

Undoubtedly, [[this will]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily affect the
region, which, in turn, will further **[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Turkey\'s **[[deterrent potential]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Can Restrain U.S. and PRC Military Activities in Outer Space," Spring

[Global action networks]{.underline}, NGOs, social
[[activists]{.underline}]{.mark}, small businesses, multinational
corporations, [and other groups and organizations who have a stake in
how outer space is governed have the ability to **[reframe]{.mark}
U.S.** and **PRC military [agendas]{.mark}** and project both hard and
soft power [that **influence how decisions are made**]{.mark} from the
local level up]{.underline}. In turn, [these [stakeholders]{.mark} can
**[crisscross]{.mark}** throughout the **regulated** and **unregulated
areas** of [**social**, **political**, and **military affairs**]{.mark}
in ways [which **interconnect** ]{.mark}**the globe** [and
**question**]{.mark} **the [traditional methods]{.mark} used [to
govern]{.mark} people's activities**. Advancements in new technologies
help these individuals and organizations to **communicate**, **travel**,
and **coordinate** in ways which were **unimaginable** just fifty years
ago and **further create new questions** about the **traditional ways of
governing**]{.underline} while reshaping the evolution of global
affairs. [Although the [**debate** over what]{.mark} forms of
[government]{.mark} are **[best suited to manage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
cyberspace, **[outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or any other kind of
space [will]{.underline} probably [continue]{.underline} for many years
to come, there is no doubt that [during the debate **[non-state
actors]{.mark}** will have a **significant role** in deciding the final
outcome. [Through **protest** and]{.mark}]{.underline} other forms of
[**[political participation]{.mark}** organizations working [outside of
the state can]{.mark} help to [**develop strategies** and
**goals**]{.mark} for governments [to **prevent**]{.mark} **the type of
[weapons prolif]{.mark}eration** that make outer space less hospitable
to human activities. It is **important** for these organizations to have
**common** and **specific [goals]{.mark}** that are **acceptable for
states** who continue to see the value in using outer space for national
security purposes. These organizations can **[push states to]{.mark}
sign on** to treaties that **[prohibit]{.mark} the placement of
[weapons]{.mark} in space**]{.underline} such as the PPWT, [[or]{.mark}
insist that governments **[establish better]{.mark} transparency** and
**confidence building measures** ([**TCBMs**) that make]{.mark} outer
[space **less militarized**]{.mark} and **more hospitable**]{.underline}
for all of humankind. Although both treaties and TCBMs are important,
neither can address the problem of militarization if there is no way to
enforce any agreements negotiated. This is why it is important for
non-state organizations to reconsider their own role in the enforcement
process for agreements that prevent or reduce the militarization of
space. [The [U.S.]{.mark} has **consistently been [reluctant]{.mark}**
to sign on to any agreement that **prohibits**]{.underline} ASAT testing
or the placement of [**weapons in outer space** [because]{.mark}, the
U.S. argues, [there is **no way to verify**]{.mark} that other countries
are abiding by the terms of the agreement. There is no doubt that
[verification]{.mark} procedures [are]{.mark} an **extremely
[tricky]{.mark} business**, [but]{.mark} it is an area where
**[non-state powers can]{.mark} help**]{.underline}.83 There are already
[organizations working outside of government]{.underline} which
[[provide **monitoring** and **live tracking data**]{.mark} for
satellites orbiting the Earth]{.underline}. This data is published on
websites like n2yo.com, which helps to increase transparency regarding
government and commercial space activities, while also providing some
security for those concerned about debris falling to Earth; however
[organizations like this can **go even further** in making governments
**more transparent** and **accountable** for their actions]{.underline}.
By teaming up with other organizations and networks like the GN,
Reporters Without Borders, or the Union of Concerned Scientists [new
strategies can be developed [to]{.mark} help **[make
verification]{.mark} more [plausible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When trying
to come up with solutions as to how to better govern the commons Elinor
Ostrom tells us in her book Governing the Commons that public-private
partnerships which encourage agreed upon normative behavior and
self-monitoring can be part of the solution.84 I agree with this
assessment, but am wary of any type of partnership that prevents
non-state powers from acting independently of the state. One reason the
news media has failed in being objective is precisely because of its
often cozy relationship with governments and corporate enterprise.
Agreements can be made through legislation that allow for partnerships
to exist where both non-state and state actors work together to enforce
verification procedures, but when [these partnerships]{.underline} grow
too close it can be assumed that objectivity and the role of the
non-state actor as a government watchdog will fall by the wayside. As
GANs, NGOs, and other organizations fill the void where governments and
corporations have failed they will realize that they [**alone** cannot
ensure the global space commons remains accessible to all, nor provide
the assurance that it will be used only for providing global goods and
maintaining international peace and stability. They can, however, help
to ensure there are **more means of ensuring** that people and
organizations in powerful positions can be **held accountable** for
their actions within the space commons]{.underline}. [In the **long
term** it may not be a treaty or TCBM that safeguards outer space, but
rather the **restoration** or **creation** of a **collective moral
imagination** that views human activity in outer space, **not** from the
**narrow perspective of national security** and **defense**, but through
a '**mental model**' which envisions each individual as part of a
**whole**, yet **diverse system** that is **much bigger than national
borders** or **regional boundaries**]{.underline}.85 [By **encouraging
the development** of a **collective moral imagination** [non-state
powers]{.mark} will **better be in a position to [provide
suggestions]{.mark}** as to [how]{.mark} the [rules of the road are
**created** and **enforced**]{.mark}. Accidents will occur and rules
will still be broken, but when **new possibilities are created** that
allow for diversity within a set of expected normative behaviors there
will be a **[greater chance]{.mark}** that countries like [China will
**accept civilian control** of]{.mark} their [space]{.mark} agency,
while also **[making]{.mark} international [coop]{.mark}eration**
between state and non-state actors **[more appealing]{.mark}**.
Instilling [morality]{.mark} in the collective imagination [is **not
enough**]{.mark} to ensure that in the future outer space is **not just
another battle space environment**. [Rules]{.mark} of the road **do
[have to be established]{.mark}** []{.mark}and international treaties
and national laws **do have to be agreed upon** [and
**enforced**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but before these rules can be set in
stone it is necessary to first re-evaluate previous rules that have been
abandoned or ignored. Before any treaty or code of conduct in outer
space is negotiated non-state actors should encourage space-faring
nations to revisit the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and question whether the
international community is indeed abiding by the principles laid out in
it. Article III says "States Parties to the Treaty shall carry on
activities in the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon
and other celestial bodies, in accordance with international law,
including the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of
maintaining international peace and security and promoting international
cooperation and understanding."86 [Is the use of space for military
purposes **really in the interest** of maintaining international peace
and security? The U.S. might argue that it is, but **for those who are
targets** of satellite guided munitions, missiles, or electronic attack
from the heavens, the answer is **no**. As other countries become **more
capable of using space for military purposes** the U.S. **may decide**
that the answer is **also no**]{.underline}, but the reality is that no
matter how just one considers the use of force to be, the use of force
is not the same as maintaining peace. Violence does not equal peace.
There should be no argument against this, but humans tend to rationalize
violence in a way that makes this argument somehow valid, and therefore
it can be expected that violence will continue to be used so long as
citizens accept the moral justification for the use of force. Article IV
of the Outer Space treaty says, "States Parties to the Treaty undertake
not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear
weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such
weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in
any other manner."87 Here the question is what constitutes a weapon of
mass destruction? Is a chemical or biological weapon in outer space any
more capable of causing mass destruction than a constellation of lasers
or an orbiting electromagnetic pulse bomb? Probably not, which is why
before states continue to agree to this article they may want to
reconsider what the definition of a weapon of mass destruction is and
how new technologies can continue to change that meaning from time to
time. Also in Article IV it states, "The Moon and other celestial bodies
shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for
peaceful purposes. The establishment of military bases, installations
and fortifications, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct
of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies shall be forbidden."88 Here
one might ask how can the Chinese National Space Agency legally operate
on the moon if the agency is militarily controlled? Also, how do
dual-use technologies fit into this? Is the mining of helium-3
exclusively for peaceful purposes, and how will anyone know if it is
not? These questions should be answered before any new treaty or
international agreement can be made. Instead of only coming up with a
new code of conduct the international community should also look at the
treaties already in place and ask how those treaties can better be
implemented, and how non-state actors can help to enforce their
implementation. Also, there are other Earth-bound arms control
agreements that may be useful for demilitarizing outer space. For
instance the ABM treaty which the U.S. abrogated from deals specifically
with missile defense which has been the cause of so much frustration and
tension between the U.S., Europe, China, and Russia. What is prohibiting
the U.S. from revisiting this treaty? How can non-state actors influence
policymakers so this treaty comes back into the limelight? What can be
done to ensure the deployment of missile defense systems does not
increase asymmetric countermeasures to these defenses, and how does
missile defense provide more security if the deployment of this defense
causes other states to build and deploy more missiles and
countermeasures to overwhelm the system? These are not easy questions to
answer, and so far no one has been able to come up with a viable
solution, but if humans truly want to make the world a safer place and
the outer space environment more accessible and more hospitable for
humans, than surely non-state actors should be welcomed by the
international community to help make it happen. Conclusion Global action
networks, NGOs, small businesses, [social activists]{.underline},
multinational corporations, [and other [stakeholders]{.mark} in space
security have a **special role** in [creat]{.mark}ing an **environment
of [coop]{.mark}eration** between governments, [as they]{.mark} are able
to **[work both]{.mark} with[in and outside]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark}
established [system]{.mark} and are capable of **bringing [together
individuals]{.mark}** from different sectors of society who can
**[make]{.mark} international [projects succeed]{.mark} where
governments fail**]{.underline}. As global power becomes diffused these
non-state actors will be more capable of investing in the types of
projects that states refuse to participate in. [[**While U.S.** and
**Chinese** ]{.mark}**officials [debate over whether]{.mark} or not the
[two]{.mark} countries should [coop]{.mark}erate in outer
space**]{.underline}, GANs, NGOs, [activists]{.underline}, and firms
[can **seep through the loopholes** and **begin cooperation** before
governments **even have the opportunity to question** whether
cooperation is in a country's best interest or not. Although it **may be
difficult** for non-state actors to **tackle the big projects that
require cooperation** both on Earth and in space, [they can]{.mark}
still **[take]{.mark} some [small steps]{.mark} that [move]{.mark} the
level of [coop]{.mark}eration [up notch by
notch]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [As non-state actors prove that
cooperation between individuals from adverse nation-states is possible
they will be **more able to convince governments** that large
projects]{.underline} like the creation of an international space agency
or a truly international space station or lunar research park [is
**attainable**. When governments begin to understand the type of mutual
benefits international space projects can bring they may begin to **work
closer together** in ways which not only **reconsider how outer space is
used by the military** and **intelligence communities**, but in ways
which **integrate space systems** so that destruction of such systems
becomes a **less viable option** for all parties involved. For instance
Russia, [China, the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}, and the European Union
[[can]{.mark} **integrate navigation satellites** in ways which **reduce
redundancy** and **[encourage]{.mark} the [sharing of data]{.mark}**
[and **assets** so that]{.mark} **all parties have a stake in one
another's systems** to the point that interfering, [disrupting]{.mark},
or destroying a system or component of the system [becomes **self
destructive**]{.mark} and **unnecessary**. Soviet-American
cooperation]{.underline} on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [in 1975
provide a good]{.underline} a [example of how **[hostile
countries]{.mark} can [work together for peace]{.mark}ful purposes in
outer space**, and the continued cooperation between Russia and the
U.S.]{.underline} after the fall of the Soviet Union [on projects like
the Mir Space and International Space Stations show that **national
rivalry** and **security concerns can be overcome** in the long
run]{.underline}.89 China, who seeks to be an ISS partner, will continue
to develop and modernize its military-run space agency whether or not
the U.S. is on board with this advancement. As China continues to carry
a successful record in its outer space activities, while leapfrogging
technologies and moving independently of the U.S., it may eventually
find itself as a leader in outer space while the U.S. falls behind.
Because the Obama administration has chosen to refocus its military
efforts on the Asia-Pacific region China has even more of an incentive
to continue pursuing military activities in outer space to counter these
efforts. This in turn creates the type of environment that encourages
the proliferation of space-based weapons systems by countries throughout
the region and has the potential to become a conflict neither China nor
the U.S. can afford. For this reason GANs, NGOs, and other [non-state
actors **must be active in finding those areas** in which **cooperation
between Chinese** and **American**]{.underline} individuals,
organizations, and corporations on [**civilian outer space projects is
possible**. [By **demanding states be**]{.mark} **more
[transparent]{.mark}** in how they conduct space security and by
**encouraging more participation in the decision making process of space
governance**, [non-state actors]{.mark} can **[pressure
governments]{.mark}** in ways that **force them [to reconsider]{.mark}
further [militarizing]{.mark} space** [or **acting in
unilat**]{.mark}**eral nationalistic ways** that have so far reduced
security on Earth and outer space, rather than enhancing
it]{.underline}. Small and large firms which encourage the
commercialization and democratization of the space industry will help to
increase access to outer space to more people who, when free from the
often narrow and imaginatively constraining military mindset, can
provide new creative and multibeneficial ways for utilizing the space
commons and the global goods it has to offer. [As more people are given
more access to space it will become **impossible** for governments to
**not work with non-state actors** to create a better system for
governing it and ensuring it remains a peaceful place to work and even
live]{.underline}. Traditional news media, [**grassroots**
and]{.underline} alternative news media, **[[academic]{.mark}
media]{.underline}**, and science fiction and entertainment media
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} all be used to [further ensure space is
**used for peaceful purposes** by helping to [**reframe the
agenda**]{.mark} of the military and intelligence communities [through
**continuous** and]{.mark} **persistent dissemination of [content which
encourages coop]{.mark}eration** and **civilian utilization of outer
space**]{.underline}. By [doing]{.underline} so these and other media
groups [can **help in the process** of developing a **morally injected
[collective imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline} that envisions all of
humankind working together without regard to the borders nation-states
bind their citizens to. Throughout this thesis I argue that a more
holistic and multi-faceted approach to arms control should be taken to
not only demilitarize space, but to also create a more cooperative and
peaceful international environment on Earth. [[This]{.mark} approach
[can be]{.mark} **further [broadened]{.mark}** [to include]{.mark} many
more [aspects that]{.mark} help to **not just cure the symptom** of
weapons proliferation, but that also **[address]{.mark}es the [root
cause]{.mark}** of the problem. History has shown that powerful leaders
are **influenced by**]{.underline} media and [**non-state actors who
can** and **do impact their future actions**, which in too many cases
have led to **conflict** and **war** rather than **peace** and
**cooperation**. It is time to **take note of this history** and ensure
that the lessons learned from it are **not lost** so that humans do not
continue to **repeat the same mistakes** that have lead generation after
generation through the **continuous cycle of war** and **weapons
development**. There are **no winners** to such a cycle]{.underline},
except perhaps for the [[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves which
[are becoming **so powerful** and **dangerous** that they not only
**[threaten all of]{.mark} human [existence]{.mark}**, but also the
[**ecosystems in** and **outside**]{.mark} **of Earth's atmosphere**
which are **necessary for all of the planet's life forms**. [There **may
never be a permanent solution**]{.mark}]{.underline} that ensures the
space commons continues to be utilized for the global goods it offers,
[[but **as long as more people are educated**]{.mark} about the problems
militarization creates, [the **more access**]{.mark} **they have**
[to]{.mark} information on **[how these]{.mark} problems [can be
resolved]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the **more they are [able to use
those]{.mark} facts [to influence]{.mark} defense [policy]{.mark}**
through collaborative transnational efforts, the **better they will be
able to come up with a solution**]{.underline} for future generations
who may one day live, work, and play in outer space together as a global
community that seeks to maintain a lasting and sustainable peace for all
of humankind.

**resources**]{.underline} (Okolloh 2009; Goodchild and Glennon 2010;
Roche, Propeck-Zimmermann, and Mericskay 2011). [[A **growing number**
of]{.mark} urban [governments]{.mark} now use **online** and **mobile
geo-services** that allow residents to **[submit]{.mark} their
observations of [infrastructural problems]{.mark}** and **other local
needs**]{.underline} via a geo-tagged text message or photograph or by
adding an object to a map interface (Foth and others 2009; Elwood and
Leszczynski 2013; Johnson and Sieber 2012). [[Citizens]{.mark} have
[used]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[high-resolution
[imagery]{.mark}]{.underline}** of virtual globes like Google Earth [[to
**monitor**]{.mark} **military [buildup]{.mark}** or **reveal supposedly

2009; Perkins and Dodge 2009). These examples extend a vibrant history
of civic applications of the earliest interactive mapping tools,
including map mashups of Chicago crime data or post-hurricane evacuation
and relief needs in New Orleans (Miller 2006; Crutcher and Zook 2009).

The technologies and practices that underlie these applications of
Internet-based spatial media have become known by a dizzying array of
new terms in the past several years. Volunteered geographic information
(VGI) refers to spatial data sets compiled from the contributions of
many individuals, such as citizen reports to a disaster relief map
interface (Goodchild 2007; Elwood, Goodchild, and Sui 2012). The
geospatial Web originally referenced only the centrality of geographic
location as a means of organizing and retrieving online content (Scharl
and Tochtermann 2007). The term ''geoweb'' is now used more broadly to
identify this location-mediated Internet content and the hardware and
software that enable its production, such as GPS-enabled handheld
devices or freely available mapping APIs (Elwood and Leszczynski 2013).
[''**Neogeography''** has been used to refer to]{.underline} what some
users do with interactive online mapping tools -- namely to [the
**production of maps** and other **visual spatial artefacts** through
various geoweb resources, often by **laypersons**, **activists**,
**artists**, **grassroots groups**, and other ''**non-expert**''
actors]{.underline} (Eisnor 2006; Turner 2007; Wilson and Graham 2013).

Geographers' [interest in these phenomena is **wide-ranging**, including
**core**]{.underline} GIScience **[questions about
ontologies]{.underline}**, data quality, [and **data
integration**]{.underline} (De Longueville and others 2010; Grira,
Bedard, and Roche 2010; Haklay 2010); disciplinary concerns about the
future of cartography and related arenas (Gartner 2009; Kraak 2011;
Goodchild and Turner 2013; Kitchin and Dodge 2013); [and questions about
their **social** and **political implications**]{.underline} (Crampton
2009; Dodge and Perkins 2009; Elwood 2010). In the latter arena -- the
social and political implications of neogeography -- we see divergent
concerns and predictions. Some scholars trace trends of increasing
surveillance and state/ private-sector control over the production and
circulation of geospatial imagery, maps, and the resources needed to
produce and share them (Perkins and Dodge 2009; Gerlach 2010;
Leszczynski 2012). Others suggest that [neogeography constitutes **new
spaces of civic engagement** or **resistance** and begins to **level
access to**]{.underline} cartography, [**geovisual imagery**, and
**deliberative** or **decision-making forums** in which they are
used]{.underline} (Madden and Ross 2009; Okolloh 2009; Meier 2011). In
particular, as scholars have debated this empowerment/marginalization
dialectic (Sheppard 2005), there has been a great deal of interest in
whether and how [[neogeography]{.mark} might **[enable]{.mark} the
[participation]{.mark}**[, **influence**, and **agency**]{.mark} **of
less powerful actors**]{.underline}. The existing literature offers two
kinds of propositions for how they might do so -- [[by **offering less
powerful actors**]{.mark} **greater [access]{.mark}** to conventional
spheres/practices of deliberative decision making and
cartography]{.underline} (see Tulloch 2008; Hall and others 2010; Gryl
and Jekel 2012), [or by enabling them to **create their own alternative
spheres** of deliberation/engagement and cartographic
praxis]{.underline} (cf. Kingsbury and Jones 2009; Okolloh 2009; Lin
2013).

[These]{.underline} different propositions [are]{.underline}, at heart,
[arguments about the **forms of politics** that are or might be
constituted through the practices associated with
neogeography]{.underline}, and it is this concern that will take centre
stage in our discussion here. [By ''politics'' we are **not** referring
to the specific realm of electoral [politics]{.mark} but rather to
[a]{.mark} **much broader [range]{.mark}** [of individual and collective
practices which]{.mark} **act on** or **[engage]{.mark} structurally
[mediated inequalities]{.mark}**, the **social** and **material
relations** of everyday life, and **negotiations over
identity**]{.underline} (Kofman and Peake 1990; Brown and Staeheli
2003). This wider definition of politics is critical for theorizing
[neogeography]{.underline}, given that it [has **from inception** tended
to be **pluralist**, **processual**, and **rooted in everyday
life**]{.underline}. For all the discussion of participation,
empowerment, democratization, or even liberation with respect to
neogeography praxis, there has been comparatively little direct
theorization of [[the **forms of politics**]{.mark} that are or might be
advanced via neogeography]{.underline}, save for two recent papers that
[[draw on]{.underline}]{.mark} Michel [de Certeau's]{.underline} (1984)
[notions of]{.underline} ''strategy'' and
[[''**tactics**'']{.underline}]{.mark} (Gryl and Jekel 2012; Lin 2013).

For de Certeau, ''strategy'' is constituted through the spaces and
practices of hegemonic actors/institutions and forms of knowledge.
Voting, presenting a map and oral testimony at a public hearing, staying
out of an area framed in local discourses as a ''bad'' neighbourhood, or
analysing local needs through community development's ubiquitous
strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) technique are all
examples of strategy. In contrast, **[tactics rework]{.underline}** (or
at least refuse to cooperate with and reproduce) [the **norms**,
**representational practices**, and **spatial meanings** of strategy.
Going]{.underline} walking [in a neighbourhood]{.underline} commonly
[said to be dangerous **challenges this spatial imaginary of danger**
through the action of **occupying the space**, and it **transgresses a
tacit prohibition** against going there]{.underline}. ''Walking'' this
neighbourhood in the virtual space of a neogeography platform such as
Google Maps is a visual spatial tactic (Lin 2013) that transgresses the
same prohibitions in a digital environment. Of course, these two
examples of spatial tactics are not identical experiences, given that
one occurs in a material space and the other in a virtual space. But the
broader point to be taken from Lin's notion of visual spatial tactics is
that such digital practices can constitute a transgression or reworking
of the spatial norms and restrictions of strategy.

As we will develop further in the next section, much of the existing
literature on the societal significance of neogeography is already
tacitly structured around this concept pair. Some work focuses upon the
potential of neogeography as a practice of strategy (or a politics
''from within''), and others emphasize neogeography as an arena for
tactics (the means and practice of a ''politics from outside'' by
disempowered and excluded actors). Yet on both sides, this work has to
date focused primarily on neogeography as a practice or site of
political action or engagement. We will argue here that
[neogeography]{.underline} practices -- specifically visual spatial
[[tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [are **significant** not only because
they **[constitute a space for]{.mark} political [action]{.mark}** or
**engagement [by less powerful actors]{.mark}**, but also because they
can function as **key sites of political formation**]{.underline}. In
what follows we show how [the]{.underline} visual spatial
[**[tactics]{.mark} of neogeography** can [foster]{.mark} the
**formation of political subjects**, the **formation of [collective
action frames]{.mark}** (which may spur these political subjects to
action), [and]{.mark} **collaborative formation of [shared
knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, visual spatial tactics in
neogeography are significant not just as practices of alternative
political engagement or action by actors ''from below'' but even more so
as practices constituting critical antecedents to such action. [Tactical
neogeography practices constitute subjects as **critical thinkers**,
**mobilized actors**, and **active agents** in collaborative
knowledge-making]{.underline}.

As we will develop further in the next section, much of the existing
literature on the societal significance of neogeography is already
tacitly structured around this concept pair. Some work focuses upon the
potential of neogeography as a practice of strategy (or a politics "from
within"), and others emphasize neogeography as an arena for tactics (the
means and practice of a "politics from outside" by disempowered and
excluded actors). Yet on both sides, this work has to date focused
primarily on neogeography as a practice or site of political action or
engagement. We will argue here that neogeography practices --
specifically visual spatial tactics -- are significant not only because
they constitute a space for political action or engagement by less
powerful actors, but also because they can function as key sites of
political formation. In what follows we show how the visual spatial
tactics of neogeography can foster the formation of political subjects,
the formation of collective action frames (which may spur these
political subjects to action), and collaborative formation of shared
knowledge. Thus, visual spatial tactics in neogeography are significant
not just as practices of alternative political engagement or action by
actors "from below" but even more so as practices constituting critical
antecedents to such action. Tactical neogeography practices constitute
subjects as critical thinkers, mobilized actors, and active agents in
collaborative knowledge-making.

We develop these arguments from research conducted with young teens ages
10--13 at two Seattle schools from 2009 to 2012. School A is a public
middle school enrolling approximately 500 students, 95% of whom are
racial or ethnic minorities and 75% of whom come from low-income
families. It is located in one of Seattle's areas of highest poverty,
with comparatively high rates of unemployment, foreclosure, crime, and
violence. School B is a private middle school of 100 students, 35% of
them racial or ethnic minorities and 40% of whom receive financial aid
for their tuition. Its surrounding neighbourhood grapples with many of
the same concerns facing School A's neighbourhood, but arguably to a
somewhat lesser degree.

Our action research with these two schools examined the potential roles
of interactive mapping platforms in fostering civic engagement,
collaboration, and place-based teaching and learning. In each of the
three years, we conducted a 7- to 15-session module of interactive
mapping activities, designed to complement the school's or teacher's
existing efforts to have students learn from and about their city. In
year 1, in a class we offered as part of the educational after-school
program at School A, sixth and seventh graders created interactive maps
of their "everyday geographies." In creating and sharing their maps,
they represented and reflected upon the opportunities, constraints, and
patterns in the places and movements of their own daily lives and those
of their classmates. In year 2, as part of our activities with a seventh
grade social studies class at School B, students created interactive
multimedia maps exploring key sites and spatial processes in the urban
histories of racial and ethnic minority groups in Seattle. In year 3, we
conducted our mapping activities in the "environmental stewardship"
curriculum of a fifth grade science class at School B. Students
researched and mapped the environmental and cultural histories of two
river systems in the Puget Sound area.

In each of these three mapping units, participating students created
their interactive maps in an open-source mapping platform developed for
this project. Offering a simpler set of tools than many existing
commercial mapping web-sites, our platform enables students to create a
map object (point, line, or polygon), position this object on a base
map, give the object a name or title, and add text, images, URLs, or
video in a textbox. When a map object is selected, this associated
content appears in the window to the right of the map view (Figure 1).
Another key feature of our platform is an interactive commenting
function that allows users to select a map object and add (or respond
to) comments, questions, or additional information. These comment
streams appear beneath the map view and are accessed by clicking the map
object (see Figure 1). The students primarily created their maps in this
platform, but many of them knew about and used Google Maps in parallel,
to access some of its additional services.2 Specifically, they used its
search engine to find particular addresses or place names and its street
view service to explore photographic street-level panoramas of specific
areas.

While our three mapping units were quite different in substantive theme,
we structured all three around a similar cycle of individual and
collaborative mapping, exploration of content, and critical reflection.
Using Kolb's (1984) "experiential learning" cycle, this process moved
from observing, sharing, or learning about concrete activities, events,
or places in the "real world" to understanding the more abstract
processes that generate them. As students mapped sites or spatial
processes they deemed important (to the theme of each of the three
units), our goal was for them to learn about and critically reflect upon
the social, political, and economic processes and relationships \[End
Page 277\] that produce these geographies. Unsurprisingly, they also
gained cartographic skills and experience with digital spatial
technologies, but this was not our primary pedagogical objective.
Further, while this research has generated contributions to scholarship
in geography education and youth geographies (Elwood and Mitchell 2012;
Mitchell and Elwood 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2013), our purpose here is to
use evidence from this project to illustrate a more theoretical
contribution to ongoing efforts to articulate the forms of politics that
are or might be advanced in neogeography practice. With their emphases
on examining and engaging social and spatial processes and
relationships, especially vis-à-vis the past histories and present
conditions of places in which they live, the youth neogeographies
generated as part of our project are a rich source of evidence through
which to consider these questions.

The pedagogic practices described above generated the empirical basis of
our research on neogeography, children's politics, and citizenship
education. Our research design follows Burawoy's (1998) extended case
method, an inductive approach for generating theory from qualitative
ethnographic research (as opposed to deductive research designs
structured around testing hypotheses). In this approach, a case is
selected on the basis of its ability to illuminate the conceptual
questions of the research -- for us, questions about the forms of
politics that are possible for neogeographers who operate from positions
of disempowerment and exclusion. Our questions about the political
potential and significance of neogeography for less powerful actors
further demand an inductive analysis of evidence that can illuminate
processes, meanings, and social relations. To this end, our evidence
included the students' multimedia maps; map comments from teachers,
parents, and peers; and field notes produced by all members of our
research team after each class session. Our inductive analysis involved
iterative interpretive review of the data to generate and refine
propositions about the nature and forms of politics advanced through the
children's neogeographies. We validated our emerging findings through
triangulation across multiple sources of evidence, aimed at identifying
tensions, contradictions, and commonalities in the data. The specific
examples presented below are illustrative demonstrations of the forms of
politics practised by our young neogeographers but are not the only
instances in which these practices occurred in the project.

Neogeography and the political

Recent scholarly work on neogeography has moved in several different
directions. Some scholars have begun to trace the conditions of its
emergence, particularly the hardware and software developments enabling
it (Goodchild 2007; Haklay, Singleton, and Parker 2008). Others examine
the shifting political-economic relationships around the production of
spatial data and maps signalled by neogeography, with particular
interest in the changing roles and relations of state and private-sector
actors in this enterprise (Goodchild 2007; Harvey 2007; Radcliffe 2009;
Boulton \[End Page 278\] 2010; Kinsley 2010; Leszczynski 2012). Others
have focused on the substantive content produced through neogeography
practices, with particular interest in how people, places, or phenomena
are represented (or not) and implications of these presences and
absences for the (re)production of social difference, inequality, and
the digital divide (Zook and Graham 2007; Crutcher and Zook 2009; Graham
2010; Graham 2011; Graham and Zook 2011).

Another key debate has been the implications of neogeography for
cartography, GIScience, and geography. Some have characterized the roles
of academic and professional cartographers and geographers as
diminished, whereas others argue they are transformed but still
essential (Gartner 2009; Goodchild 2009; Goodchild and Turner 2013). Map
quality and public cartographic and spatial literacies have also sparked
concern. For instance, the head of the British Cartographic Society
recently worried that neogeographers (or "lay cartographers") will
diminish the quality of maps (Crampton 2010), a concern mirrored in
criticisms of neogeographers' cartographic design (Das and Kraak 2011;
Kraak 2011). Perhaps prompted by these concerns, a number of recent
interventions offer pedagogies aimed at using neogeography platforms to
foster spatial literacy, principles of cartography and GIS (Patterson
2007; Allan 2008; Campbell 2008; DeMers and Vincent 2008; Papadimitriou
2010), and active citizenship and civic participation (Milson and Earle
2008; Harris, Rouse, and Bergeron 2010; Gryl and Jekel 2012).

Finally, this ever-growing literature has examined the social and
political significance of neogeography by considering the purposes for
which individuals and social groups engage these platforms. Some have
considered the potential and limits of neogeography for public
involvement in local government planning and decision-making (Rouse,
Bergeron, and Harris 2007; Tulloch 2008; Johnson and Sieber 2012; Sieber
2012) or for citizen participation in activities such as redistricting
(Crampton 2013). Several studies consider the rising use of neogeography
interfaces to elicit and circulate citizens' observations of
on-the-ground needs and conditions in natural disasters and other
crises, with particular emphasis on the extent to which these
applications may enhance the effectiveness of government and NGO relief
efforts (Liu and Palen 2010; De Longueville and others 2010; Zook and
others 2010). Some studies examine the ways that activist groups, NGOs,
and other citizen groups use neogeography to connect with diasporic
communities, disseminate counter-narratives, or mobilize diverse forms
of action by members or potential advocates (Corbett 2012; Elwood and
Leszczynski 2013; Lin 2012, 2013). Many of these counter-hegemonic
neogeographies have included forms of recreation or art, ranging from
"spot the black helicopter" games that "surveil back" on the state to
digital map art that troubles traditional cartographic rationalities
(kanarinka 2006; Cobarrubias and Pickles 2009; Crampton 2009; Kingsbury
and Jones 2009; Lauriault and Wood 2009; Perkins and Dodge 2009).

Threading throughout this work on neogeography applications is a strong
interest in their potential to foster inclusion, agency, and
empowerment, especially for disempowered/excluded social groups or the
context of deeply asymmetrical state-society relationships. Yet they
tend to seek these outcomes in two very different arenas. Some focus on
how neogeography has been or might be used in conventional spheres of
deliberative politics, such as participatory governance schemes or the
negotiations of NGOs/citizen organizations with state actors and
institutions (Elwood and Leszczynski 2013). Others examine how
neogeography may constitute an alternative site for citizens'
articulations, deliberations, and cartographies (Kingsbury and Jones
2009; Lin 2012, 2013) -- a way for citizens to advance
counter-narratives, cartographic representations, or forms of
(political) speech unlikely to be recognized or included in conventional
deliberative spheres. These two approaches are implicitly differentiated
by where and how they situate the realm of the political neogeography
practice, and they do so in ways that draw on de Certeau's (1984)
notions of "strategy" and "tactics." One emphasizes a "politics from
within" -- neogeography as a means to gain access to existing structures
of deliberative democracy -- whereas the other emphasizes a "politics
from outside," neogeography as an alternative realm for citizen voice.

As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and
Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been
termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development
and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this
critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage
in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the
cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in
ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to
use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or
challenge those put forth by others. A more inclusive public sphere will
emerge, Gryl and Jekel argue, when citizens are able to use interactive
geo-media to engage in the representational and deliberative practices
of "strategy."

Yet conceiving of the political potential of neogeography through
notions of strategic practice has inherent limits. Critical cartography
and GIS scholarship have long underscored that access to the bounded
disciplinary practices of cartographic "strategy" is by definition
partial and that many forms of spatial knowledge cannot be represented
as "geographic information" nor expressed through conventional
cartographic representation (Pickles 1995, 2004; Crampton and Krygier
2005). Feminist critiques remind us that structural inequalities and
even definitions of "the political" exclude some social groups from the
realms and practices of deliberative politics (Fraser 1990; Howell \[End
Page 279\] 1993). Indeed, de Certeau's effort to recognize the actors,
practices of politics, and forms of knowledge that remain outside the
realms of "strategic practice" are at the heart of his concept of
"tactics." Because of these inherent limits, theorizations of the
political significance and possibilities of neogeography must also
include tactics.

Though not theorized as such, [[tactics]{.mark} are in evidence
in]{.underline} many [initiatives that]{.underline} use neogeography
platforms for performance, art, and other counter-cartographic practices
(kanarinka 2006; Kingsbury and Jones 2009; Perkins and Dodge 2009).3
These performative/artistic neogeographies are characterized as
political on the basis that they parody notions of cartographic
omniscience or [[**expose the inability** of]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[representational practices to]{.mark} **fully [capture]{.mark}**
[human experience]{.mark}/perception]{.underline}, or that [[they
**challenge**]{.mark} **state [control]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} spatial
[data production]{.mark} and circulation [by
**revealing**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and making fun of) [**[what is
supposed to be]{.mark} secret** or **[concealed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Lin (2013) engages the notion of tactics directly in her study of
Chinese neogeographers fighting rapid urbanization, forced demolition,
and illegal expropriation. In this context, the sites and practices of a
politics of ''strategy'' simply do not or cannot exist -- online
activities are tightly controlled and monitored, and citizens have
little access to formal decision-making structures. Yet citizens
concerned with forced urban removal have developed [neogeography
[tactics]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**[contest]{.mark} dominant
[narratives]{.mark}** [and **institutions**]{.mark} and **restrictions
on activities** and **mobilities in particular places**]{.underline}.
For example, in one of their Googlebased map mashups, users can
''stroll'' an off-limits lakeshore or share artistic representations of
it, virtually reclaiming and reimagining a space that cannot be occupied
in real life.4

These examples show the potential of neogeography as the basis for a
politics of [tactics]{.underline} -- a site for citizens to
[**[produce]{.mark} new [spaces]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **share
[counter-narratives]{.mark}** in a context [where]{.mark} **direct
[confrontation is not possible]{.mark}** and for actors who are
**excluded** from a politics of ''strategic practice.'']{.underline} As
Lin (2013) and others suggest, [attention to tactics as an **important
part** of the political repertoire of neogeography **greatly expands the
forms of politics** (and by extension, the **range of political
actors**) we can recognize]{.underline}. Yet our research with young
teens' neogeographies suggests that the significance of visual spatial
tactics extends beyond their potential as a form of political action or
civic engagement. The visual spatial tactics profiled in much of the
literature on counter-hegemonic neogeographies are largely performed by
already existing political subjects, already mobilized by their concerns
about various inequalities, injustices, or social, political, economic,
and environmental conditions. Neogeography serves as the site or space
in which these mobilized subjects perform their resistance. Our evidence
suggests that visual spatial [[tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} in
neogeography [can have an **even more foundational significance**,
serving **not just** as a site of **political action** but as a site of
**political formation**]{.underline}. That is, we will show how visual
spatial [tactics of neogeography]{.underline} can be sites for (1) the
formation of political subjects, (2) the formation of interpretive
frames that can mobilize these subjects for action, and (3) the
formation of shared knowledge through collaborative cartographies.
Neogeography praxis has the potential to [**[constitute]{.mark}
political [subjects]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} **mobilized political
collectivities**, and **shared knowledge** -- the **critical antecedents
[to any]{.mark} form of [political engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Newly Emerging Trends Relevant for Outer Space Development

The passage of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 demonstrates a
willingness by the U.S. to fund a stepped-up phase of space activities.
During bad economic times, this Act provides \$58,400,000,000 for
various space-related programs from 2011 to 2013. In 2010/2011, media
reports constantly alerted the general public to be ready for the
retirement of the NASA Space Shuttle program. This initiative
complemented the New Vision for U.S. Space Exploration Policy (2004), as
well as various other laws and policies initiated by the United States
and discussed in previous chapters. When read together, it is fair to
assume the newly emerging space industries will be related to achieving
advanced space transportation systems, private spacecraft development,
commercial space habitats, space stations, space settlements, commercial
space mining, spacecraft trajectory optimization techniques for landing
on near-Earth asteroids, commercial spaceport construction,
interplanetary telecommunications, and space exploration missions. [[The
thing]{.mark} for **teachers**, **students**, and **members** of the
general public to do in order [to **prepare**]{.mark} **to take

and **what**]{.mark} **types of [goods]{.mark}**, **services**, [and

Education as the Solution

[Outer space development **historically** has been the **purview of

engineering, and math (STEM) fields. [The STEM-oriented
opportunities]{.underline} for those proficient in physics,
astrophysics, space medicine, engineering, calculus, etc., [**have
always been limited** to a few select students. But now]{.underline}
global society is calling for something, more since the STEM fields have
failed to attract diverse people on an equal footing.186 [A **bridge can
be created**]{.underline} by using social and behavioral sciences
curricula, thereby [to attract people from a **wider range of
backgrounds** to learn about outer space development]{.underline} and
newly emerging industries.

the international community. [[Curricula]{.underline}]{.mark} using the
new paradigm [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to
[**[motivate]{.mark}** and **inspire** a new generation of
[scholars]{.mark} who can **play a key role** in the process of outer
space development]{.underline}. In effect, an educational system that
unleashes human creativity and curiosity will empower students with the
knowledge and competencies not only for the second wave of outer space
development, but also for the global engagement necessary for the 21st
century and beyond (Weeks and Tamashiro, 2011).

[It is **never too early** to begin cultivating a person's
**intellectual** and **academic talents**]{.underline}. Most children
are naturally curious. As part of the curriculum, [students]{.underline}
of all ages [can be shown how [to]{.mark} **do [research]{.mark}**, how
to **write a research paper**, to [**compile** and **present data**,
**perform critical analytical thinking**, and]{.mark} to [**anticipate**
and **develop relevant skill-sets**]{.mark} for newly emerging industry
trends. Learning [these]{.mark} skills will [enable]{.mark} more people
to **develop**]{.underline} an **[[expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}**
aimed at supplying talent that will be in demand as future industries
emerge. [[This can **change people's lives**]{.mark}. Students can learn
how to **anticipate** and **prepare** for future emerging
industries]{.underline} while they are at the K-12 level. [Students can
also **learn**]{.underline} at young ages [**how to get recognized** by
publishers, editors, the mass media, and others.]{.underline}

In situations where the resources necessary for teaching science are
unavailable, space studies can be introduced through the social and
behavioral sciences and the arts. [For many years, [space]{.mark}
studies [has remained the]{.mark} **exclusive [purview
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} engineers, scientists, and technology
[**[experts]{.mark}**. However, [there is **room at the table**]{.mark}
for]{.underline} social and behavioral sciences [students to **join in**
and **develop a specialty**]{.underline} area of expertise. [Key actors
within the outer space development community have expressed an interest
in **advancing space studies to a broader audience**. Orchestrating such
a process carries with it the power to **improve international
relations**, **education**, **inspiration**, **dreams**, and
**creativity**]{.underline}, and to boost the global economy by creating
a myriad of new jobs and degree programs. [[We can]{.mark} **open an
additional door** to [allow a **broader range of knowledge**]{.mark}
into the minds of more people [by **introducing**]{.mark} **outer
[space]{.mark} development [studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} through the
social and behavioral sciences (Hammond and Weeks, 2011). Unlike
engineering, [an **interdisciplinary**]{.underline} social and
behavioral sciences [**lens** enables us to **interpret the meaning
behind sets** and **patterns of human behaviors**]{.underline}---this
includes the behavior of individuals, institutions, groups, presidents,
members of congress, business and other organizations, mass media,
international organizations, and lawmakers.

[Humankind can **progress beyond** the "STEMs = space studies" model by
**including**, **encouraging**, **[involving]{.mark}**, and
**preparing** a new breed of]{.underline} social and behavioral sciences
[geniuses. These would be people who are **[naturals in
i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations**, **conflict resolution**, and
**peace studies**, as well as]{.underline} versed in [**international
law**, **politics**, **social [psychology]{.mark}**[, **critical
analysis**]{.mark}, **discourse analysis**, **international
[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}, artistic architecture,
[**[race]{.mark}** and **ethnic studies**, **[gender
studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, religious studies, economics, finance,
business and entrepreneurship, [**history**, and **political economy**,
[while]{.mark} also [being concerned with **inequality**]{.mark}
**gaps**, **[oppression]{.mark}**, **subjugation**,
**[revolts]{.mark}**, **uprisings**, **revolutions**, [and]{.mark}
**various [other social]{.mark}** and **behavioral
[phenomena]{.mark}**[. People who **understand**]{.mark} **the
[issues]{.mark} concerning human beings** now [have a way of
**participating in**]{.mark} **future emerging [space]{.mark}
industries**]{.underline}. The audience of learners scheduled to receive
cutting-edge knowledge of fields relevant for outer space development
will be expanded by online learning techniques and sharing of
information through the open-source technologies of the Internet.

Shaping Ideology

Imagine [**teaching students** about the **newly emerging trends**
related to outer space development]{.underline}. This [would give
students **permission to envision** and **carve out their role** in
designing future space societies. [Students **from all disciplines**
can]{.mark} be **taught to [see what's coming next]{.mark}** [by
learning to **research**]{.mark} and **interpret**]{.underline} economic
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, laws, and international relations.
[This will enable them to **detect newly emerging industries** and to
**anticipate the elements** likely to be in demand. Students can then
**shape their skill-sets** and **prepare**]{.underline} to satisfy these
emerging needs. [Students can be **taught**]{.underline} to perform this
type of [**interdisciplinary analysis** and to **research combined
dynamics**---**government hearings** and **transcripts**, **policy
statements** and **speeches**, **laws**, **economic initiatives**, and
**international treaties**. [They can]{.mark} also]{.underline} be
taught to [**[combine]{.mark}** this type of [**primary data**
with]{.mark} **theoretical [understandings of]{.mark} historical**,
**ideological**, **institutional**, **political**, **economic**,
**psychological**, and **[structural phenomena]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Misc\-\--AT: Turkey-Russia Collab

Russian Revisionism Drives Turkey Closer to the Geopolitical West

[While discontent with the West]{.underline} and anti-Westernism have
facilitated cordial and cooperative relations between Moscow and Ankara,
[[Russian]{.mark} geopolitical [revisionism]{.mark} has]{.underline}
almost invariably [**[pushed Turkey closer]{.mark}** to the
**[West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [logic here is
**straightforward**]{.underline}. First, [Russian [revisionism
poses]{.mark} **direct [security threats]{.mark}** [to
Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, the [[centre of]{.mark}
gravity of Turkish-Russian [rivalry]{.mark} has [been]{.mark} the
**[Black Sea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From the Turkish perspective,
[Russia's actions]{.underline} -- [from]{.underline} the war in [Georgia
to annexation of Crimea and]{.underline} the [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} -- [all decisively [tilt]{.mark} the **[balance of
power]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} this region in **[Russia's
favour]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although Russia's policy in each of these
cases might have specifics and con­textual nuances, [taken together they
point to one **unmistakable outcome**]{.underline}: [[Russian
revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark} in the post-Soviet space [and an
aspiration to turn the region into a sphere of domination]{.underline}.
This [will only **[aggravate]{.mark}** the **[Turkish]{.mark} threat
[perception]{.mark}** vis-à-vis Moscow]{.underline}.

Second, the post-Soviet space is also Turkey's immediate neighbourhood.
If successful, the [[Russian]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} will [restrict
Ankara's]{.mark} geopolitical [room for manoeuvre]{.mark}]{.underline}
in this region, [and **undermine** its **standing** from the Black Sea
to the Balkans and the South Caucasus to Central Asia]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[**Turkish** and **Western** **interests**]{.mark} are
[in **broad**]{.mark} [**alignment** in]{.mark} these
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [so Moscow's]{.underline} geo­political
[revisionism is likely to bring Turkey and the West]{.underline}
relatively **[closer together]{.underline}**.
