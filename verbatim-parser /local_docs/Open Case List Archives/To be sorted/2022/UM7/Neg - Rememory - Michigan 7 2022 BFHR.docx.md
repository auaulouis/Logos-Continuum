Because [[neither **biology** nor **symbolics**]{.mark} are
**[deterministic]{.mark}**]{.underline} systems, this fantasy theme is
avoidable, even if it is powerfully attractive. Because
[[both]{.underline}]{.mark} biology and symbolics [are
**[material]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however,
[[specific]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of [[work]{.mark} are
[necessary]{.mark} in order [to avoid]{.mark} the lure of that
**[predisposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This point is crucial, because
it invalidates the twentieth century (idealist) approaches to social
change, which envisioned a single (violent) leap away from the social as
sufficient to create and maintain better worlds. Thus, when Žižek and
others urge us [to]{.underline} "**[[Act]{.underline}]{.mark}**" with
violence to destroy the current Reality, [[without]{.mark} a vision of
an **[alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on the grounds that the links
between actions and consequences are never certain, we can call his
appeal both a [[failure of **imagination** and]{.underline}]{.mark} a
failure of **[[reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As for reality, we have
dozens of revolutions as models, and the [historical [record
indicates]{.mark}]{.underline} quite clearly [that they]{.underline}
generally [lead not to **harmonious cooperation**]{.underline} (what I
call "AnarchoNiceness" to gently mock the romanticism of Hardt and
Negri) [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead to [the production of
**[totalitarian states]{.mark}** and]{.underline}/or violent
**[factional strife]{.underline}**. A materialist constructivist
epistemology accounts for this by predicting that it is not possible for
symbol-using animals to exist in a symbolic void. [All sym**bolic
[movement]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} a **[trajectory]{.mark}**, and [if you
have not imagined]{.mark}]{.underline} a potentially [**[realizable
alternative]{.mark}** for that trajectory to take]{.underline}, then
what [[people]{.mark} will [leap into]{.mark} is **biological
[predispositions]{.mark}**]{.underline}--- the first iteration of which
is the rule of the strongest primate. Indeed, [this is what experience
with revolutions has shown to be the **most probable outcome** of a
**revolution**]{.underline} that is merely [against an
**Evil**]{.underline}. The failure of imagination in such rhetorics
thereby reveals itself to be critical, so it is worth pondering sources
of that failure. The rhetoric of "the kill" in social theory in the past
half century has repeatedly reduced to the leap into a void because the
symbolized alternative that the context of the twentieth century
otherwise predispositionally offers is to the binary opposite of
capitalism, i.e., communism. That rhetorical option, however, has been
foreclosed by the historical discrediting of the readily imagined forms
of communism (e.g., Žižek9 ). [The hard work [to invent]{.mark} [better
alt]{.mark}ernative[s]{.mark} is [not as]{.mark}]{.underline}
dramatically **[[enticing]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the story of the
kill: [[such]{.mark} labor [is]{.mark} **piecemeal**, **intellectually
[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [requires **multi-disciplinary
understandings**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} perhaps requires [more
**creativity** than the typical academic theorist can
muster]{.underline}. In the absence of a viable alternative, the appeals
to Radical Revolution seem to have been sustained by the emotional zing
of the kill, in many cases amped up by the appeal of autonomy and
manliness (Žižek uses the former term and deploys the ethos of the
latter). But [if [one does not provide a]{.mark} **viable
[vision]{.mark}**]{.underline} that offers a reasonable chance of
leaving most people better off than they are now, then [[Fox News has
a]{.mark} **better [offering]{.mark}**]{.underline} (you'll be free and
you'll get rich!). [A revolution posited as a void cannot
succeed]{.underline} as a horizon of history, [other than as constant
local scale violent actions]{.underline}, perhaps [connected by shifting
networks we call]{.underline} "**[terrorists]{.underline}**."

[Rhetorical pragmatism helps us reflect on the uses of rhetoric that
come naturally to us]{.underline}. Instead of remaining oblivious to the
field\'s pervasive rhetorical dimensions, it puts them under scrutiny,
and provides the necessary epistemological qualifications as well as
elaborations without which things can go seriously wrong in a rhetorical
discipline. First, rhetorical pragmatism embraces a broad range of
rhetorical modes of reasoning. This includes, inter alia, the abstract
and comparative modes. The abstract mode revolves around Aristotle\'s
enthymeme. The comparative one involves using language that provokes our
imagination to think of parallels between phenomena that are usually
seen as entirely distinct. There are many variants of both modes. While
both allow for - and even demand - a considerable measure of creativity
on the part of the scholar, this is especially important for the
comparative one. Language, such as figures of speech, captures our
imagination. We should make use of this by employing language creatively
to defamiliarize ourselves with the taken-for-granted as well as by
introducing and discussing novel understandings.

Second, skepticism and adjudication are at the core of rhetorical
pragmatism. Scholarly skepticism against truth claims is what initiates
and sustains scholarly debates. It prevents truth claims from assuming
the status of orthodoxy. Skepticism, of course, does not mean to
demolish every truth claim. It simply means to put them under critical
scrutiny. Such a critical scrutiny may end up with the---always
provisional-agreement that a truth claim amounts to a working truth. The
mechanism for reaching such an agreement is adjudication. Yet not any
kind of adjudication does the job. In order for knowledge claims to
undergo a sufficiently demanding examination, the adjudicating peer
group has to be heterogeneous. At a minimum, it has to be recruited from
across those contending perspectives in the discipline that pertain to
the research problem addressed by the piece to be adjudicated. Ideally,
it transcends disciplinary boundaries. And even if truth is generated
through such demanding multiperspectival checks and balances, we should
remain alert that adjudication is not about settling a truth claim once
and for all. It is always---this is the whole point about the metaphor
of adjudication-provisional.

Third, there is nothing wrong with intervening into IR per se. Indeed,
given the array of global problems, such scholarly interventions, in
principle, are warranted. But not any kind of intervention will do.
Rhetorical pragmatism pushes students of world politics towards
understanding scholarly interventions into political discourses as
scholarship writ large. This means first and foremost to critically
discuss what is taken-for-granted. Out of these critical discussions,
scholars can develop interventions into a constellation of
taken-for-granted ideas. They can make innovative interventions that
propose novel understandings of the world. They can also make
reinforcing interventions that push an already established commonplace
higher up the agenda. The benchmark for such interventions, however, is
high. They have to survive an even broader discussion, involving
multiple scholarly and nonscholarly perspectives. We have to discuss
with our fellow scholars but we also have to discuss with decision
makers, bureaucrats, activists, and the public at large. We have to
stand in the midst of those who we study instead of pretending to stand
apart or even above them. After all, the knowledge we produce may have
very real repercussions for all of us (Flyvbjerg 2001). Such a broad
adjudication makes for a rigorous system of rhetorical checks and
balances that reasonably safeguards against the deeply troubling
connection between insular scholarship and political malpractice. Even
if a scholarly argument does not survive these rigorous rhetorical
checks and balances, there is still a good chance for it to make a
difference. It may contribute to raising doubts on what otherwise passes
as unquestioned orthodoxy. Or it may play its role in shaping a broad
discussion that converges on a provisional truth different but perhaps
related to the originally proposed argument.

The Added Value of Rhetorical Pragmatism

[Rhetorical pragmatism helps us channel the **rhetorical dimensions** of
IR into **fruitful directions**]{.underline}. The added value is
threefold: First, [it broadens our understanding of
**theory-building**]{.underline}, **[empirical methods]{.underline}**,
**[empirical research]{.underline}**, [and the relationships among
them]{.underline}. The often taken-for-granted story of scholarly
reasoning in our field - scholars deduce hypotheses from a set of
premises and then test them by using a variant of the controlled
experiment - is very incomplete. It tells us of a logical form of
reasoning but remains quiet about the many other forms of reasoning
without which we cannot arrive at assumptions, cannot make inferences
based on these assumptions, cannot relate theory and empirics, and
cannot relate empirics to theory - in short cannot make theoretical and
empirical inferences. The range of practices by which we make inferences
is very broad. Rhetorical pragmatism, due to its emphasis on multiple
modes of reasoning, helps us examine this range in all its breadth and
depth, and encourages us to try out new modes of reasoning to arrive at
novel understandings of the world we study.

Second, rhetorical pragmatism helps us uncover overlaps across different
perspectives (such as rhetorical forms of reasoning) and develop
dialogue out of these overlaps. If we continue to rehash the typical
textbook divisions of IR, for example Rationalism versus Constructivism,
by emphasizing again and again the same divergences, we blind ourselves
of their convergences. Yet if we take these divisions for what they are,
that is, the products of rhetorical reasoning, and if we treat them
accordingly, that is, not shy away from scrutinizing and reframing them,
we move away from an incommensurability assumption-deeply entrenched in
our discipline---that is much more absolute than even Kuhn (1977:xi-xii)
presented it. Instead, we are very likely to uncover overlaps across
clusters of research that have previously been thought of as
incommensurable. Out of these overlaps, and driven by the curiosity to
learn something new about the world we study, we can develop dialogue
(Gadamer 1972; Bakhtin 1986; Bernstein 1991). Such a dialogue across
perspectives is of paramount importance. It is the precondition for
meaningful adjudication. Uncovering overlaps and initiating dialogue can
be performed by focusing on meta-theory, theory and methodology. It can
also be carried out-and this may often be easier-by focusing on a shared
empirical research puzzle.

Third, rhetorical pragmatism provides us with important clues for how to
disseminate knowledge responsibly. The issue of knowledge dissemination
is an important one because there is no hiding in the Ivory Tower.
Scholarly discourses and political discourses do not stand apart. They
crisscross in various ways. Most importantly, many of the commonplaces
(for example, appeasement and the democratic peace), based on which
political decision makers reason, are shaped by scholarly discourses. As
there is no hiding in the Ivory Tower, we need to think hard about how
to feed ideas into political discourses in responsible fashion. The
currently widespread practice of acknowledging uncertainty in scholarly
research on the one hand and pretending that such uncertainty is
nonexistent when attempting to diffuse knowledge beyond academia on the
other is highly dubious. Understanding scholarly interventions as
scholarship writ large is a much more responsible alternative to it.

Conclusion

International Relations is a rhetorical discipline. Rhetoric constitutes
key features of our reasoning, processes by which we evaluate knowledge,
and mechanisms through which we disseminate knowledge. These rhetorical
elements come so naturally to us that we are oblivious to them. The gist
of my argument is that we should continue "to do what comes naturally"\'
(Fish 1989). But we should stop being oblivious to it. Rhetorical
pragmatism provides a very promising avenue for shaping the rhetorical
dimensions of our discipline. It postulates a rhetoric that is far
removed from the trickery and deception that the vernacular associates
with the term. For a rhetorical pragmatist, rhetoric ought to be about
seeking exposure to different arguments, approaching these arguments
with an open mind, creatively composing one\'s own arguments, and being
constantly reminded of and challenged by the shortcomings of the
arguments that we exchange with one another. Rhetoric thus understood is
an important building block of an intellectually thriving and
responsible discipline.

As Friedrich Nietzsche (\[1887\] 1994:1; cf. Wilson 2002) knew, the
knower is strangely unknown to himself. In fact, [it is much [more
hazardous to contemplate]{.mark} the way [how we gain knowledge]{.mark}
than to gain such knowledge in the ﬁrst place]{.underline}. This is not
to deny that [intellectuals]{.underline} are a narcissistic Kratochwil
lot, with a penchant for omphaloskepsis. [[The]{.mark} **typical**
[result of their]{.mark} navel-[gazing]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[is [not increased self-awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Scholars]{.mark} are more [likely to come up with ex-post-facto
rationalizations]{.mark}]{.underline} of how they would like to see
their activity [than with accurate descriptions]{.underline} [of how
they go about business]{.underline}. As a result, in science there is a
paradoxical divide between positivist pretense and pragmatic practice.
Many prominent scholars proceed pragmatically in gen-erating their
knowledge, only to vest it all in a positivist cloak when it comes top
resenting results. In the wake of Karl Popper (1963), fantasies about
ingenious conjectures and inexorable refutations continue to hold sway
despite the much more prosaic way most scholars grope around in the
formulation of their theo-ries, and the much less rigorous way they
assess the value of their hypotheses. In proposing pragmatism as a more
realistic alternative to positivist idealiza-tions, I am not concerned
with the original intentions of Charles Peirce. These are discussed and
enhanced by Ryto¨ vuori-Apunen (this forum). Instead, I present various
attempts to make pragmatism work as a methodology for IR scholarship.
This includes my own preferred methodology, the pragmatic research
strategy of abduction. As Fritz Kratochwil and I argue elsewhere,
[abduction should be at the center of our efforts]{.underline}, while
deduction and induction are important but auxiliary tools (Friedrichs
and 2009).Of course, [one does not need to be a pragmatist to proceed in
a pragmatic way.]{.underline} [Precisely because it is derived from
practice,]{.underline} [pragmatic commonsense is a sold as the
hills]{.underline}. For example, James Rosenau (1988:164) declared many
yearsago that he coveted ''a long-held conviction that one advances
knowledge most effectively by continuously moving back and forth between
very abstract and very empirical levels of inquiry, allowing the
insights of the former to exert pressurefor the latter even as the
ﬁndings of the latter, in turn, exert pressure for the for-mer, thus
sustaining an endless cycle in which theory and research feed on
eachother.'' This was shortly before Rosenau's turn to postmodernism,
while he wasstill touting the virtues of behaviorism and standard
scientiﬁc requisites, such asindependent and dependent variables and
theory testing. But if we take his state-ment at face value, it appears
that Rosenau-the-positivist was guided by a sort of pragmatism for all
but the name. While such practical commonsense is certainly valuable, in
and by itself, it does not qualify as scientiﬁc methodology. Science
requires a higher degree of methodological awareness. For this reason,
[I am not interested]{.underline} here [in]{.underline} pragma-tism as
unspoken commonsense, or as a pretext for doing empirical research
unencumbered by theoretical and methodological considerations. Nor am I
con-cerned with [pragmatism as an excuse for staging yet another
**epistemological debate**]{.underline}. Instead, I am interested in
pragmatism as an instrument to go about research with an appropriate
degree of epistemological and methodological awareness. Taking this
criterion as my yardstick, the following three varieties of pragmatist
methodology in recent IR scholarship are worth mentioning: theory
synthesis, analytic eclecticism (AE), and abduction. Theory synthesis is
proposed by Andrew Moravcsik (2003), who claims that theories can be
combined as long as they are compatible at some unspeciﬁed fundamental
level, and that data will help to identify the right combination of
theories. He does not explicitly invoke pragmatism but vests his
pleading in a positivist cloak by using the language of theory testing.
When looking closer, however, it becomes apparent that his theoretical
and methodological noncha-lance is far more pragmatic than what his
positivist rhetoric suggests. Moravcsiksees himself in good company,
dropping the following names: Robert Keohane, Stephen Walt, Jack Snyder,
Stephen Van Evera, Bary Buzan, Bruce Russett, John O'Neal, Martha
Finnemore, and Kathryn Sikkink. With the partial excep-tion of
Finnemore, however, none of these scholars explicitly links his or her
scholarship to pragmatism. They employ pragmatic commonsense in their
research, but devoutly ignore pragmatism as a philosophical and
methodological position. As a result, it is fair to say that theory
synthesis is only on a slightly higher level of intellectual awareness
than Rosenau's statement quoted above. Analytic eclecticism, as
advertized by Peter Katzenstein and Rudra Sil, links a commonsensical
approach to empirical research with a more explicit commit-ment to
pragmatism (Sil and Katzenstein 2005; Katzenstein and Sil 2008).The 7
Even the dean of critical rationalism, Karl Popper, is ''guilty'' of
lapses into pragmatism, for example when he states that scientists, like
hungry animals, classify objects according to needs and interests,
although with the impor-tant difference that they are guided in their
quest for ﬁnding regularities not so much by the stomach but rather by
empirical problems and epistemic interests (Popper 1963:61--62). 646
Pragmatism and International Relations idea is to combine existing
research traditions in a pragmatic fashion and thus to enable the
formulation and exploration of novel and more complex sets of problems.
The constituent elements of different research traditions are
trans-lated into mutually compatible vocabularies and then recombined in
novel ways. This implies that most scholars must continue the laborious
process of formulat-ing parochial research traditions so that a few
cosmopolitan colleagues will be enabled to draw upon their work and
construct syncretistic collages. 8 In addition to themselves,
Katzenstein and Sil cite a number of like-minded scholars such as
Charles Tilly, Sidney Tarrow, Paul Pierson, and Robert Jervis. 9 The
ascription is probably correct given the highly analytical and eclectic
approach of these schol-ars. Nevertheless, apart from Katzenstein and
Sil themselves none of these schol-ars has explicitly avowed himself to
AE. My preferred research strategy is abduction, which is
epistemologically asself-aware as AE but minimizes the dependence on
existing research traditions. The typical situation for abduction is
when we, both in everyday life and as social scientists, become aware of
a certain class of phenomena that interests us for some reason, but for
which we lack applicable theories. We simply trust, although we do not
know for certain, that the observed class of phenomena is not random. We
therefore start collecting pertinent observations and, at the same time,
applying concepts from existing ﬁelds of our knowledge. Instead of
trying to impose an abstract theoretical template (deduction) or
''simply'' inferring propositions from facts (induction), we start
reasoning at an intermediate level (abduction). Abduction follows the
predicament that science is, or should be, above all a more conscious
and systematic version of the way by which humans have learned to solve
problems and generate knowledge in their everyday lives. As it is
currently practiced, science is often a poor emulator of what we are
able to achieve in practice. This is unfortunate because human practice
is the ultimate miracle. [In our own practice, [most of us]{.mark}
manage to [deal with]{.mark} many challenging [situations]{.mark}. [The
way we accomplish this is]{.mark} **completely** [different
from]{.mark}]{.underline}**,** and far more efﬁcient than, [[the way
**knowledge is generated**]{.mark}]{.underline} according to standard
scientiﬁc methods. If it is true that in our own practice we proceed not
so much by induction or deduction but rather by abduction, then science
would do well to mimic this at least in some respects. 10 Abduction has
been invoked by numerous scholars, including Alexander Wendt, John
Ruggie, Jeffrey Checkel, Martin Shapiro, Alec Stone Sweet, and Martha
Finnemore. While they all use the term abduction, none has ever
thor-oughly speciﬁed its meaning. To make up for this omission, I have
developed abduction into an explicit methodology and applied it in my
own research on international police cooperation (Friedrichs 2008).
Unfortunately, it is impossi-ble to go into further detail here. Readers
interested in abduction as a way to advance international research and
methodology can also be referred to my recent article with Fritz
Kratochwil (Friedrichs and Kratochwil 2009).On a ﬁnal note, we should be
careful not to erect pragmatism as the ultimate epistemological fantasy
to caress the vanity of Nietzschean knowers unknown to themselves,
namely that they are ingeniously ''sorting out'' problematic
situa-tions. Scientiﬁc inquiry is not simply an intimate encounter
between a research problem and a problem solver. It is a social activity
taking place in communities of practice (Wenger 1998). Pragmatism must
be neither reduced to the utility of results regardless of their social
presuppositions and meaning, nor to the 8 Pace Rudra Sil (this forum),
the whole point about eclecticism is that you rely on existing

Liberalism, Capitalism, and Empire The gulf between the self-professed
liberalism of the British Empire and the illiberalism of its actual
history has been a major leitmotif in [the recent "imperial turn" in the
field of political theory.]{.underline}3 In the words of two influential
theorists, a [guiding premise of studying political thought in the
imperial fold is that "European constitutional states, as state empires,
developed within global systems of imperial and colonial law from the
beginning,"4 and consequently, "\[e\]ven when practical and
administrative issues were to the fore, the discussion of what we can
broadly call colonial government encompassed disputes over universality,
sovereignty, freedom, democracy, property, and justice]{.underline}."5
Groundbreaking works in this2 vein first appeared with the discovery
that canonical liberal thinkers like John Locke and John Stuart Mill
were personally and professionally invested in the imperial enterprise.6
Intellectual historians and political theorists expanded on those
efforts, [adopting imperial history as a critical vantage point for
revisionist appraisals of these and other eminent members of the
European political theory pantheon.]{.underline} Clustering around the
British Empire, such reappraisals evinced a palpable anti-Whiggism in
[exposing the philosophies of subordination that authorized and
justified its systematic violence against non-Europeans.]{.underline}
For a growing number of scholars, the juxtaposition of "liberalism and
empire" has since come to denote both a specific area of study and its
central problematic, that is, a contradictory assemblage that comprised,
on the one hand, principles of moral equality, subjective rights, the
rule of law, representative government, and ethical pluralism, and on
the other, practices of domination, foreign rule, naked coercion,
untrammeled power, disenfranchisement, and exclusion. This book sets out
to [challenge a notable disposition that stamps this
scholarship---namely, the penchant to frame the connection between
liberalism and empire primarily as a problem of the politics of
representation, culture, or identity]{.underline}. Notwithstanding
differences of textual interpretation, [historical studies in this field
frequently concentrate on liberal thinkers' perceptions of and normative
judgments about the colonized peoples, which these studies then construe
as an index of liberalism's relationship to imperial rule]{.underline}.
Although the exact nature of the liberalism-empire nexus remains
controversial,7 [the controversy remains noticeably unified in its
occupation with questions of universalism and difference, its heavily
intratextual approach, and its attention to the linguistic over the
material contexts of the liberal ideas under study]{.underline}.8 By
itself, this methodological preference is not problematic. As with any
other interpretive lens, it brings into focus certain features of
liberalism's interface with empire, leaving others outside the depth of
field. [The problem is that among the dimensions that are left blurry is
the socioeconomic and institutional materiality of empire, which in turn
limits the capacity of this scholarship to analyze and critique liberal
imperialism.]{.underline} As I detail in the next chapter, on the
critical front, [a culturalist focus on universalism and difference
commands little firepower against the presentist vindications of the
British Empire as the historic protagonist of economic
globalization]{.underline}.9 On the analytic side, [a blanket politics
of universalism cannot adequately elucidate how liberal thinkers parsed
and ordered the range of cultural differences between Europeans and
non-Europeans, and why they emphasized certain differences over others
as being more relevant for imperial justification or anti-imperial
critique.]{.underline} This book attempts to address these limits by
"[rematerializing" the relationship between liberalism and empire. The
task involves complementing an account of the semantic context of
liberal ideas with an analysis of the socioeconomic context, that is,
paying as much attention to the institutional structures and economic
practices that constituted the fabric of empir]{.underline}e as to the
political languages and vocabularies in which liberal intellectuals
articulated their assessment of it. There are no doubt [multiple ways of
rematerializing the imperial context]{.underline} (e.g., gender,
ecology, [technology, law, governance), each of which would highlight a
different aspect of empire's formative impact on liberal
thought.]{.underline} I propose viewing the materiality of empire
specifically through the lens of "colonial capitalism," a notion
inspired by critical social theory and colonial political economy. As an
analytic framework, colonial capitalism rests on the fundamental premise
that capitalism has historically emerged within the juridico-political
framework of the "colonial empire" rather than the "nation-state." It
grasps capitalist relations as having developed in and through colonial
networks of commodities, peoples, ideas, and practices, which formed a
planetary web of value chains connecting multiple and heterogeneous
sites of production across oceanic distances.

The final (fourth) level of sophistication in this issues-based
[approach is concerned with [students findings]{.mark} [ways of
putting]{.mark} their **[values]{.mark}** and **convictions** [into
action]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[helping them to]{.mark} **prepare** for
and [**engage** in]{.mark} **[responsible action]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[and [assisting them in]{.mark} [developing]{.mark} the
**[skills]{.mark}**]{.underline}, attitudes, and values [[that]{.mark}
will [enable]{.mark} them to]{.underline} take control of their lives,
[cooperate with others to bring about **change**]{.underline}, [and
[work]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} a [more **just** and]{.mark}
**[sustainable world]{.mark}** in which power]{.underline},
[wealth]{.underline}, [and resources are more **equitably
shared**]{.underline}. Socially and environmentally responsible behavior
will not necessarily follow from knowledge of key concepts and
possession of the "right attitudes." As Curtin (1991) reminded us, it is
important to distinguish between caring about and caring for. It is
almost always much easier to proclaim that one cares about an issue than
to do something about it. Put simply, our values are worth nothing until
we live them. Rhetoric and espoused values will not bring about social
justice and will not save the planet. We must change our actions. [A
**[politicized ethic of care]{.mark}**]{.underline} (caring for)
[[entails]{.mark} **[active involvement]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
a]{.underline} local manifestation of a [particular]{.underline} problem
or [[issue]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[exploration]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
**complex [sociopolitical contexts]{.mark}** in which the]{.underline}
problem/[issue is located]{.underline}, and attempts to resolve
conflicts of interest.

FROM STSE RHETORIC TO SOCIOPOLITICAL ACTION

Writing from the perspective of environmental education, Jensen (2002)
[categorize]{.underline}d the [knowledge that is likely to promote
**sociopolitical action**]{.underline} and encourage pro-environmental
behavior [in]{.underline}to **[four dimensions]{.underline}**: (a)
scientific and [**[technological knowledge]{.mark}** that
**[informs]{.mark}** the [issue]{.mark}]{.underline} or problem; (b)
[knowledge [about]{.mark} the **[underlying]{.mark}**
social]{.underline}, [political]{.underline}, [and economic
**[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}, conditions, [and structures [and how
they]{.mark} [contribute to]{.mark} [creating]{.mark}
**[social]{.mark}**]{.underline} and environmental
**[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (c) [[knowledge about how to
bring]{.mark} about **[change]{.mark}s** in society]{.underline} through
direct or indirect action; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (d)
[[knowledge]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the]{.underline} likely outcome or
direction of [**[possible actions]{.mark}** and the **desirability**
[of]{.mark} those [outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although formulated as
a model for environmental education, it is reasonable to suppose that
Jensen\'s arguments are applicable to all forms of SSI-oriented action.
Little needs to be said about dimensions 1 and 2 in Jensen\'s framework
beyond the discussion earlier in the article. With regard to dimension
3, [students need **knowledge** of actions that are likely to have
**positive impact**]{.underline} and knowledge of how to engage in them.
[It is [essential]{.mark} that [they gain]{.mark} robust [knowledge
of]{.mark} the **[social]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[legal]{.underline}**, [[and **political**]{.mark}
**[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}([s]{.underline}) that prevail in the
communities in which they live [and develop a clear understanding of how
decisions are made]{.underline} [within]{.underline} local, regional,
and **[national government]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} within
industry, commerce, and [the **military**]{.underline}. [[Without
knowledge]{.mark} [of]{.mark} where and with whom power of [decision
making]{.mark} is located and awareness of the mechanisms by which
decisions are reached]{.underline}, **[[intervention is not
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, the [curriculum I propose
requires]{.underline} a concurrent program designed to achieve a measure
of **[political literacy]{.underline}**, in[cluding knowledge of how to
engage in **collective action**]{.underline} with individuals who have
different competencies, backgrounds, and attitudes but share a common
interest in a particular SSI. Dimension 3 also includes knowledge of
likely sympathizers and potential allies and strategies for encouraging
cooperative action and group interventions. What Jensen did not mention
but would seem to be a part of dimension 3 knowledge is the nature of
science-oriented knowledge [that would enable students to appraise the
statements]{.underline}, reports, and [arguments of]{.underline}
scientists, [politicians]{.underline}, and journalists [and to present
their own supporting or opposing arguments]{.underline} in a coherent,
robust, and convincing way (see Hodson \[2009b\] for a lengthy
discussion of this aspect of science education). Jensen\'s fourth
category includes awareness of how (and why) others have sought to bring
about change and entails formulation of a vision of the kind of world in
which we (and our families and communities) wish to live. It is
important for students to explore and develop their ideas, dreams, and
aspirations for themselves, their neighbors and families and for the
wider communities at local, regional, national, and global levels---a
clear overlap with futures studies/education. [An essential step in
cultivating the critical]{.underline} scientific and [technological
literacy on which **sociopolitical action** depends is the
**application** of a **social** and **political** **critique** capable
of challenging the notion of **technological determinism**]{.underline}.
We can control technology and its environmental and social impact. More
significantly, [[we can]{.mark} [control]{.mark} the
[controllers]{.mark} and redirect technology in such a way
that]{.underline} adverse environmental [impact is substantially
reduced]{.underline} (if not entirely eliminated) [and [issues
of]{.mark}]{.underline} freedom, equality, and [[justice]{.mark} are
[kept in]{.mark} the [**forefront** of discussion during]{.mark} the
**[establishment]{.mark}** [of **policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

ACADEMIC INJUSTICE DISCOURSE [Just law can **coexist with unjust
practice**]{.underline} [and both are parts of "**empirical
law**"]{.underline} [or what Bendey called "the]{.underline} **[process
of government]{.underline}**." [Empirical [law is **constantly
changing**]{.mark}]{.underline} and some theorists are optimistic that
verbal discourse has the ability to make written law more just, even
though the same unjust practices recur or new ones emerge. These
[[theorists]{.underline}]{.mark}, some of whom are or may aspire to
become public intellectuals, [[hope]{.mark} that someday **public
[political discourse]{.mark} on behalf of those who are treated
unjustly**]{.underline} [[will]{.mark} have the power to
**[interrupt]{.mark} a cycle of just written law**]{.underline}
[accompanied by continued **[unjust practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[That is, the "right" discourse perennially holds the promise of
**changing the beliefs, values, and goals of everyone in the public
auditorium**]{.underline}, [so that the same kind of unjust practices do
not perpetually chase the same kinds of just laws]{.underline}.11 [[This
search for "**magic words**"]{.underline} [is
**futile**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[for academics]{.underline}** [who are
professionally confined to dry and abstract prose]{.underline}. [Our
[verbiage **does not have the power to move the multitudes**
]{.mark}**who do not read or listen to it anyway**.]{.underline} But
[even when multitudes are inspired and emotionally stirred by great
orators, [action]{.mark} that follows [is **unlikely to result in
lasting change, without**]{.mark} **the support of [powerful
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After the 1960s, academics began a
robust practice of liberatory discourse about injustice that seems to
grow more impassioned and intense each year. The quest for demographic
diversity among students and faculty in higher education has weathered
judicial defeat of explicit affirmative action policies, but only partly
for the sake of justice. There are pragmatic prizes if the academy can
justify itself by producing a racially integrated leadership and
managerial class for business, politics, and the military. Top leaders
throughout society realize that they need such racial diversity for
broad consumption, voter support, and boots on the ground, and the
expression of that need is evident in amicus curiae briefs submitted to
the US Supreme Court as it has been torturously dismantling affirmative
action, piece by piece, since Bakke in 1978.12 [Academic political
discourse]{.underline} has been deeper than polemics and debate, exactly
because of its disciplined intellectual origins in different fields of
study (i.e., discipline imposed by distinct "disciplines"). But it [has
been **swimming upstream**]{.underline} [against a more]{.underline}
**[rarefied]{.underline}** and older academic
**[tradition]{.underline}**, particularly among many philosophers and
their gate keepers outside of the profession. Even Hannah Arendt (see
chapter 2) spoke approvingly of the life of the mind as cut off from
real political activity that occurred in the realm of "opinion." In her
1970 interview with Adelbert Reif, Arendt addressed the phenomenon of
college-stu-dent protestors, noting that they had brought social change
through optimistic belief in their ability to make a better world, while
at the same time discovering joy in civic participation. Arendt credited
such protests with the success of the civil rights movement and progress
toward ending the Vietnam War.13 As discussed in chapter 4, it is
doubtful that Arendt was correct that student protests caused the
success of the civil rights movement. A historical analysis of the end
to the Vietnam War is beyond the present scope, but what we already know
about empirical Bentleyan analyses would warrant skepticism about
Arendt's causal thesis there as well. In the same interview, Arendt
warned that demonstrations by student activists could be self-defeating
in democratic Euro-American contexts, because in attacking their
universities, they were attacking the very entities that made their
protests possible, American universities, especially large state schools
that were the sites of the protests Arendt had in mind, have perforce
developed very different financial structures since 1970. These schools
have become increasingly dependent on private corporate and
philanthropic funding, with state government funds now a much reduced
part of their budget. While this structural change is not generally
viewed as an incursion on academic freedom, it has been coincident with
a very flat era of student protest and activism. Still, Arendt\'s notion
of the \"life of the mind" remains useful if we consider that the
progressive/change-seeking output of professional academics since 1970
has been professionally accepted in the institutions that employ its
participants. Also, much of today's liberatory academic discourse can be
viewed as the legacy of earlier student protest, furthering a tradition
that may have been founded when some of the 1960s student radicals
became professors. This indicates that the connection between academic
radicals and the hands that feed them is not as simple as Arendt
thought. [In the United States, everything now points to both the
existence of **real academic freedom** and its **real
ineffectiveness**]{.underline}. [Progressive academic writers ply a
craft of formal speech that deals with contemporary injustice through
complex theoretical frameworks]{.underline}, [with requisite **scholarly
apparatuses** and **without translation into more simple views of the
world**]{.underline}; [[there is often]{.mark} also [a **lack of
translation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [from one discipline]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} another or between subdisciplines in the same
field. [The audience is other **academics** and
**students**]{.underline}. Neither specialization nor the limited and
partly captive audience should be viewed as problematic because that is
the nature of academic work, given broad social divisions of labor. But
[there is a problem with the **delusional nature** of so much of this
work]{.underline}. [The delusion consists of a naive view of the power
of academic speech to **directly change [reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The **rhetorical mode of address**]{.underline} [used by academics
writing cultural criticism]{.underline}, political philosophy, social
philosophy, or what is now called social-political philosophy (which
combines the other subfield approaches), [often proceeds as though its
authors are making **grand entries in a planetary cabala**]{.underline},
[where words have the **immediate power to become their intended
referents**]{.underline}. [Those]{.underline} who do not write and speak
cabalistically may [subscribe to the **[Trickle-Down Good Ideas
Theory]{.mark}**]{.underline} that can be traced from Plato to John
Stuart Mill to John Rawls. Subscription to [that]{.underline} theory
[[is]{.mark} **immediately [self-flattering]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [it **[lacks]{.mark} reliable [empirical
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 Although, after the US civil rights
movement, there has been an uncanny coincidence of race-blind formal
racial equality with the hegemony in political philosophy of Rawls's
requirement that those who plan fundamental social institutions do so in
ignorance of their own societal environments. As we saw in chapter 1,
Rawls was quite explicit about this: I assume that the parties do not
know the particular circumstances of their own society. That is, they do
not know its economic or political situation, or the level of
civilization and culture it has been able to achieve. The persons in the
original position have no information as to which generation they
belong.17 Both race-blind racial equality and Rawlsian ideals are
compatible with race-based real inequality. There are, of course,
counter-examples, such as Katherine MacKinnon's work on sexual
harassment in the workplace as expressed in current law and
institutional policy.18 Nevertheless [[even **very good**]{.mark}
**academic political [discourse about justice]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
injustice [[cannot be relied]{.mark} up[on to attract
**implementation**]{.mark} **or application [in real
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This may be [because there has not been
sufficient]{.mark} time for the development of training programs for a
new profession of **"[bridgers]{.mark}," [who]{.mark} could
[translate]{.mark} good [ideas in the academy for those who]{.mark}
govern and [make policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An internal problem for
such translators would be to decide where to anchor their bridges in
fields---every humanistic field---where experts disagree. However, the
current tradition of progressive academic writing and speech is less
than half a century old and if and when such translators emerge, they
will develop their own professional criteria for choosing among
contending experts. [Public media, as a democratic analogue to
disagreement within academic discourse, supports the idea
that]{.underline} expressing and airing [views]{.underline} in
day-to-day practices or special "national conversations" also [have
immediate practical results]{.underline}. [It is **not evident how there
could be such results**]{.underline}, [when opposing views and opinions
are treated with the same respect and have equal access to [the]{.mark}
same mass [auditorium]{.mark} that **[lacks rules for evidence or valid
argument]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As with academic discourse, there is
no structured connection to official decision processes. [The only
reliable result]{.mark} of participation in such **unbinding
referenda**]{.underline} [[is that]{.mark} those who
[participate]{.mark} are able to **[express
themselves]{.mark}**]{.underline} and get attention that may benefit
them in the marketplace of their related endeavors. Public expression
also serves to, represent and create collective atmospheres of belief,
attitude, and opinion. These atmospheres are implicitly known by a
majority of people in the culture, even though such knowledge is
difficult to validate. Ambiguities cannot be resolved by recourse to
public opinion polls, because understanding the results of those polls
requires creative interpretive skills that draw on what is already known
about relevant atmospheres. For example, suppose that more blacks than
whites believe that white privilege is real and that O.J. Simpson was
innocent, or that more whites than blacks believe that white American
police officers are not, in general, racially biased. Are the views of
whites evidence of racial bias or racial oblivion? Are the views of
blacks evidence of racial preference or paranoia? Moreover, such polls
almost always have a large racial overlap of opinion: If 29 percent of
blacks compared to 71 percent of whites believe X, then 71 percent of
blacks and 29 percent of whites do not believe X. Does this mean that
the percentages of each group that does not contribute to the
discrepancy in belief recorded in the polls are in some degree of
agreement? Experiments in social psychology could be designed to answer
such questions and others like them, but it is important to decide
beforehand why the data is important and what it does and does not
indicate. For instance, testing the claim that white privilege is a
reality of contemporary life requires some prior definition of what is
meant by "white privilege," which can range from injustice to social
courtesies. In a widely discussed 2013 experiment conducted in
Queensland, Australia, economists Redzo Mujcic and Paul Frijters found
that the majority of free bus rides, based on conductor generosity, were
dispensed to whites, with blacks least likely to receive this courtesy,
compared to all other racial groups among commuters. Journalist Britni
Danielle, writing for a general audience on Yahoo News, touted this
study as evidence that "white privilege is real," without distinguishing
between an amenity such as a free bus ride and recognition of one's
rights by not being subject to arbitrary stops and frisks by police
officers.19 Conservatives reading Mujcic and Frijter's study might say
that the bus driver may have been acting rationally based on past
experience with unruly black passengers. From a progressive perspective,
more specifics would need to be introduced to defend the claim that this
study revealed white privilege, such as controls for the apparent social
class and gender of passengers, as well as the preexisting racial
climate among bus commuters in Queensland, as well as the broader racial
atmosphere throughout Australia in 2013. The 2015 Academy Awards What is
racial atmosphere and climate? A US example that is also global could
help clarify these vague ideas, provided that it is understood
beforehand that in this context, as in most public references to
\"race,\" 'racial" means "pertaining to racism." From beginning to end,
the 2015 Academy Awards ceremony hit racist notes that slid by
unchecked, because it was an occasion of celebration. Neil Patrick
Harris, the host, began with what might have been a critical remark
about the lack of racial diversity among audience members and award
winners: "Tonight we honor Hollywood's best and whitest, sorry, bright
est." For those who were uncomfortable with the lack of robust racial
diversity among audience members and award winners, his remark might
have validated their unease. But those who would have been uncomfortable
with more racial diversity may have been heard "best and whitest" as
support for their social values. (The discourse of white privilege as a
critique of contemporary anti-nonwhite racism is, as indicated, that
kind of double-edged sword.) Midway through the ceremony, Patricia
Arquette called for people of color and members of the lesbian,
bisexual, gay, and transgender (LBGT) community to support legislation
for equal pay for women and to commit themselves to supporting women,
thereby overlooking the women who were either or both people of color
and members of the LGВТ community. This kind of oversight may perhaps be
excused by Arquette's ignorance of what academics have been for decades
analyzing as "intersectionality." But Sean Penn's remark at the grand
finale awarding for Best Picture to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the
Mexican director of Birdman, was simply, explicitly, racist: \"Who gave
this son of a bitch a green card?" Inarritu later brushed off the insult
by saying he found it \"hilarious," because "Sean and I have that kind
of brutal relationship. I think it was very funny."20 Inarritu attempt
at a "save" for Penn does not address the impact of Penn's insult on
other Mexicans and Mexican Americans, including those without green
cards who struggle to remain employed in the face of anti-immigrant
prejudice and discrimination. (That such a moment of maximum recognition
was brought so low by a racist crack is not unusual in US culture, where
the nastiest forms of racist insult are often let loose on people of
color who have succeeded.) As a spectacle watched by almost thirty-four
million, the 2015 Oscars, despite ratings lower than recent years, was a
global public event.21 Symbolically, it has no peer for the display of
beauty, talent, and artistic creativity. Its subtext inevitably has
implications about current American race relations, which influence
their future. The racial implications of the Oscars replays in millions
of minds at countless other public celebrations and entertainment
venues, as well as in private interactions (for a year at least). Such
spectacles are forms of public discourse and what they represent or fail
to represent about US racial demographics and the attitude of the
dominant white group creates or augments a specific racial climate that
in 2015 is part of a more general racial atmosphere of ambiguity and
indeterminacy. At the 2015 Academy Awards, for many critical observers,
the issue or subject pertaining to race (insofar as it is understood
that subjects of race are subjects of racism), was recognition.22 The
beauty, talent, and artistic creativity of people of color was not fully
recognized. Some people of color did get awards and some audience
members were people of color, so recognition, along with diversity, was
not completely absent. But there appeared to be insufficient racial
diversity for audience and award winners to be considered racially
integrated. And that appearance was symbolic. However, the symbolic
meaning is ambiguous: Were there people of color who were deserving of
awards but did not get them because they were people of color? Is race a
factor in who I becomes a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences? In the future, will the racial makeup of award winners
become more or less representative of their proportions in the motion
picture industry? If the proportion of people of color in the motion
picture industry is not proportional to their presence in the population
at large, why is that? The answers to these questions are undetermined
in the symbolic spectacle of the 2015 Academy Awards. The observer does
not know if recognition of the achievements of people of color in the
movie industry will improve, stay the same, or get worse, and she does
not know how to find out. The racial (i.e., in regards to racism)
climate of the Academy Awards is cloudy, subject to many different
interpretations, some of them conflicting. It is an epistemologically
unstable racial climate, because people of color do not know what the
weather is in that climate, as a basis for prediction, and neither do
they know how to find out. [The shared judgment throughout the American
atmosphere of race in the early twenty-first century is that racism is
morally bad]{.underline}. [This judgment is a **general
principle**]{.underline} [that leaves the **nature of racism
undefined**]{.underline} throughout the atmosphere and most of the
climates and subclimates of race. [[The]{.mark} overriding shared
[judgment is a **bitter and ineffective refuge**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for nonwhites, because it does not protect them from either First
Amendment-protected racist expressions or actions that turn out to be
indirectly racist. Energetic self-aware racist whites can try to evade
the judgment that they are racist through coded language for racial
difference, and the use of intermediate activities and traits as
subjects of direct action. That is, something other than race, which
nonetheless does a good job of picking out members of a specific racial
group, can be used instead of the race of that group to maintain
prejudice and legitimize discrimination. [The]{.underline} term
**["racial climate"]{.underline}** [has a history of meaning
"micro-aggressions" based on race]{.underline}, small cuts, insults, and
slights that can have a cumulative effect of individual harm.24 [In
using the term "racial atmosphere," reference may be made to other
issues of harm to people of color, such as **ignorance**]{.underline} of
black history [and]{.underline} contemporary racism or
**[discrimination]{.underline}** in career advancement.25 [The
implication of these meanings is that the micro-aggressions add up to
what is perceived as a **general predisposition of white
people**]{.underline} [to treat people of color in unjust ways. But, at
this time, ideas of racial atmosphere and climate also work as
metaphors]{.underline} for what is unknown about race relations and
attitudes; they capture the vagueness and unpredictability of racial
prejudice and discrimination that occur in a society where nonwhites
remain disadvantaged, even though there is formal equality. This "vague
weather" aspect of atmosphere and climate is an epistemological
condition of indecision that may or may not constitute a lasting crisis,
although some syndromes of political injustice should be viewed as
crises. A crisis is a period of indecision and uncertainty that requires
a resolution before life can go on. Will blacks and other people of
color achieve more equality with whites, or is the United States---and
with it the world, because US racism is exported with business
practices, tour-ism, and entertainment products---on the brink of a new
era of explicitlу direct oppression of people of color? Are most white
Americans, whose race-neutral economic and social activities have racist
effects on nonwhites, genuinely ignorant of how the system in which they
operate works, or are they secretly but knowingly hearts-and-minds not
clear that this indeterminate aspect of present racial atmosphere and
climates must be resolved now. We do not know if life can go on if it is
not resolved or what it means for life to go on, or not. We do not even
know if the putative crisis can be resolved at this time, because there
is as yet no systematic and sustained, impassioned, liberatory dis-
course for our condition of ambiguity, a time with a black president and
police killing with impunity of unarmed black youth, a time of voting
rights for everyone but new restrictions and requirements that
disproportionately affect African Americans.26 [Except for what
academics **write and say** and **how important they think their
discourse is**]{.underline} (among themselves), [[American
discourse]{.mark} of racial liberation [is at a
**standstill**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And]{.underline}]{.mark} [insofar
as academic discourse is uttered and received [in a **closed
system**]{.mark},]{.underline} [with a **semicaptive
audience**]{.underline} [and **no reliable means for it to affect the
real world**]{.underline}, [[that standstill remains **at the disposal
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} history, where history is understood to be the
**[unpredictable]{.underline}** result of **[[contingent
events]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, if academic oppositional
political discourse can be related to a longer historical trend, a more
coherent and optimistic picture might emerge. Cornel West\'s ideas about
the American black prophetic tradition appears to be a relation to such
a trend.

### 2NC\-\--Legal Change Good

#### The interim\-\--focusing [solely]{.underline} on your relationship to a structure denies agency and is paternalist to less privileged people of color.

2\. The CLS critique of piecemeal reform [Critical scholars
reject]{.underline} the idea of [piecemeal reform. **Incremental
change**, they argue, merely postpones]{.underline} the [wholesale
reformation that]{.underline} [must occur]{.underline} to create a
decent society. [Even worse, an unfair]{.underline} social [system
survives by using]{.underline} piecemeal [reform to disguise and
legitimize oppression. Those who control the system weaken resistance by
pointing to the occasional concession]{.underline} to, or periodic court
victory of, a black plaintiff or [worker as evidence]{.underline} that
[the system is fair]{.underline} and just. In fact, Crits believe that
teaching the common law or using the case method in law school is a
disguised means of preaching incrementalism and thereby maintaining the
current power structure." To avoid this, CLS scholars urge law
professors to abandon the case method, give up the effort to ﬁnd
rationality and order in the case law, and teach in an unabashedly
political fashion. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} CLS [[critique of]{.mark}
piecemeal [reform is **familiar, imperialistic and wrong**. Minorities
know]{.mark} from bitter experience that
[occasional]{.mark}]{.underline} court [[victories do not mean the
Promised Land]{.underline}]{.mark} is at hand. [[The critique]{.mark} is
imperialistic in that it [tells]{.mark}]{.underline} minorities and
other [[oppressed peoples **how they**]{.mark} **should [interpret
events]{.mark}** affecting them. [A court]{.mark} order
[directing]{.mark}]{.underline} a [housing authority to disburse [funds
for heating]{.mark}]{.underline} in subsidized housing [[may postpone
the rev]{.mark}olution, or it may not. [In the meantime, the order
keeps]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of [poor [families warm. This may
mean more]{.mark} to them [than]{.mark}]{.underline} it does to [[a
**comfortable academic**]{.mark} working in a warm office. [It **smacks
of paternalism** to assert that]{.mark}]{.underline} the [possibility of
[revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} later [[outweighs the certainty of
heat]{.mark} now]{.underline}, unless there is evidence for that
possibility. The Crits do not offer such evidence. Indeed, some
[[incremental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} may [**[bring
revolution]{.mark}ary changes [closer]{.mark}**, not push
them]{.underline} further [away]{.underline}. Not all small
[reforms]{.underline} induce complacency; some may [whet the appetite
for further combat]{.underline}. The welfare family may hold a tenants'
union meeting in their heated living room. CLS scholars' [critique of
piecemeal reform]{.underline} often [**misses these possibilities**, and
neglects]{.underline} the question of [whether total
change]{.underline}, when it comes, [will be what we want]{.underline}.

#### The aff's shift in epistemology can't create political change -- only institutional focus secures it. 

**Kitchen '10** (Nicholas; Deputy Director of the London School of
Economics IDEAS US International Affairs Program; 2010, Review of
International Studies, "Systemic pressures and domestic ideas: a
neoclassical realist model of grand strategy formation," pg. 117-143)
\*edited for ableist language\*

Fundamentally [the state is made up of individuals. Individuals
construct systems, institutions and bureaucracies; individuals lead and
follow; individuals make decisions.]{.underline} On what basis do
individuals decide which ideas to hold? The first is the quality of the
idea itself -- its internal coherence, its congruence with known
realities. The second key to success resides in the speaker himself --
his intellectual status, his eloquence of advocacy. Thus [the power of
an idea to persuade others at any one moment in history resides both in
itself, and in the power of those who hold it. The causal effect of
ideas on policies has tended to be displaced onto the political effects
of individuals in IR theory, so that the persuasiveness of ideas is
assumed rather than examined, and treated as constant.]{.underline}77
[It is]{.underline} however, [important to recognise that [some ideas
are]{.mark} 'better' than others, and are [more likely to progress
into]{.mark} the [policymaking]{.mark} arena, where institutional
factors may then come into play.]{.underline} This is not to deny the
crucial role of forces exogenous to them that push certain ideas to
heart of policymaking. Whilst [the degree to which ideas generate
popular support may provide them with power mediated through public
opinion, [ideas can take a shortcut to policy success if they
have]{.mark} the backing of individuals and [institutions that]{.mark}
themselves [have power]{.mark}.]{.underline} The character of these
'couriers' of ideas that may be as important, if not more so, than
anything intrinsic to the idea itself.78 [At the individual
level]{.underline} then, [neoclassical realism understands that [the
ideas held by]{.mark} powerful [actors within the state matter]{.mark}.
Whilst the intrinsic power of a particular idea makes its progress into
such positions more likely, the ideas that will impact most upon foreign
policy are those held by those in decision-making positions in the state
and those who directly advise them.]{.underline} Thus as Mead notes, 'It
matters who the President is. If Theodore Roosevelt and not Woodrow
Wilson had been President when World War I broke out, American and world
history might have taken a very different turn.'79 [The second location
at which ideas may impact at the unit level occurs when individuals with
shared ideas coalesce into groups, organisations, and common practices
within the state to form institutions that operate in both formal and
informal sectors of the policymaking process. [The formation of
institutions reflects]{.mark} the fact that [ideas]{.mark} that
[are]{.mark} somehow [**embedded** in particular structures]{.mark} are
possessed [of greater power]{.mark}. Institutions]{.underline} can [act
as couriers for ideas in three ways]{.underline}.80 '[Epistemic
communities' of [experts]{.mark} have the policy-relevant knowledge to
[exert influence on]{.mark} the [positions]{.mark} adopted by a wide
range of actors.]{.underline} The extent of the influence of such groups
is dependent on their ability to occupy influential positions within
bureaucracies from where [[they]{.mark} may [consolidate]{.mark} their
[power]{.mark}, thereby [institutionalising the influence of the
community]{.mark}]{.underline}.81 However, [their ability to infiltrate
bureaucratic posts will depend]{.underline} -- at least in part -- [on
the receptiveness of the existing bureaucratic order to their
ideas.]{.underline}82 [A second means by which [institutions act]{.mark}
as couriers is [by]{.mark} the **[encasing]{.mark}** of [**ideas** in
formal rules]{.mark} and procedures at the creation of the institution
itself.]{.underline} Once they have become embedded in this way, [[those
ideas]{.mark} with which the institution was founded [**can continue to
influence policy** even though the]{.mark} interests or [ideas of their
creators may have changed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, ['when
institutions intervene, the impact of ideas can be prolonged
**[for]{.mark}** decades or even
**[generations]{.mark}**.']{.underline}83 [In both of these ways,
'[ideas acquire force when they find organizational means of
expression']{.mark}.]{.underline}84 [The third way in which ideas can
impact is through the structural arrangements institutions create. These
structures set up road-blocks and throughroutes which determine the ease
with which ideas can gain access to the policy process]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the structure of the institutional framework may determine the
political and administrative 'viability' of particular
ideas]{.underline}, that is, their ability to appeal to current
conditions. [[Institutional structure]{.mark} therefore [ensures]{.mark}
that [policymakers only have access to a limited set of ideas,]{.mark}
whether those are percolated up to them or searched for by
them.]{.underline}85 In this way, [the ideas that form what some refer
to as 'strategic culture' may provide a reliable guide to a state's
likely reaction to shifts in the structure of the international
system.]{.underline}86 [Underlying both individuals and institutions are
the ideas contained in the broader cultural context within which the
state is located. Ideas that are embedded in social norms, patterns of
discourse and collective identities become accepted, 'instinctual' parts
of the social world and are experienced as part of a natural objective
reality.]{.underline}87 In this way [cultural variables subconsciously
set the limits and terms of debate for both individuals and
institutions, and so have 'a profound effect on the strategic behaviour
of states.]{.underline}'88 [Mediated through [institutions and
individuals]{.mark} who]{.underline} are
[\[[ignore]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~blinded~~ to [potential
[alternatives]{.mark}, ideas embedded in national culture therefore have
the potential to explain 'why some states act contrary to the structural
imperatives of the international system]{.underline}.'89 [The power of
ideas]{.underline} therefore [rests on 'the ability of believers in
ideas to alter the costs and benefits facing those who are in a position
to promote or hinder the policies that the ideas demand.']{.underline}90
[[In]{.mark} the process of [foreign policy]{.mark} 'engineering',
organisations and the [ideas]{.mark} they espouse or represent [vie with
one another for dominance]{.mark} and autonomy.]{.underline}91
[Decisions taken reflect the process of formulating the choices to be
presented.]{.underline}92 [[Throughout]{.mark} the process of [making
foreign policy powerful ideas]{.mark} -- whether that power resides in
their couriers or is internal to the ideas themselves -- **[are
prevailing over weaker ideas]{.mark}**.]{.underline}93

### 1NC\-\--Narratives Fail

#### Personal narrative is not the corrective to technocrats 

David **Levasseur 01**. West Chester University communication studies
professor. 2001. "Egocentric Argument and the Public Sphere: Citizen
Deliberations on Public Policy and Policymakers", Rhetoric & Public
Affairs, 4.3, project muse

[While]{.underline} the [personal narratives from participants in the
study certainly seemed to spark enthusiasm, such engagement came at a
significant cost. As with other forms of egocentric argument,
[narratives that focus on the self are]{.mark} largely [**unable to
steer the** **conversation towards**]{.mark} more **[transcendent
communal outcomes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A group discussion in Ohio
reveals this characteristic of personal narratives. In this particular
discussion, participants actively debated the issue of whether
government should support labor unions: M1: I don\'t think the unions
are going to be wiped out, first of all. And I\'m not a proponent of
unions. I\'m basically anti-union, okay? . . . However, by the same
token, unions have got to work the same way in being fair to companies,
and I\'ve seen situations where unions, because of some of the things
they did, were a disgrace. Perry Power Plant\--I know people who were
told to go hide\--I have nothing to do\--go hide. That\'s WRONG! Okay,
I\'ve seen situations where a person, because he\'s in the union and he
has this job classification, then he can\'t do anything else and he\'s
sitting there for six and a half of his eight hours because he\'s only
needed to do these two things, but he\'s got to be there because nobody
else can do it because the unions state that you\'ve got to have a
person to do this and a person to do this and so on. M2: Well, that\'s
his trade though. What do you do? M1: I\'m an accountant but I do a lot
of other things other than just accounting things. M2: Well, what if
somebody came in and tried to take your job\--take your livelihood?
Something you\'ve trained for, you\'re second, third generation of this
particular . . . M1: Yeah, but I can\'t be allowed to sit around for six
and a half hours out of the eight hours when I could be doing something
else but I can\'t do it because . . . M2: No, that\'s not my point.
\[End Page 414\] M1: Well, that\'s my point! If I could do something
productive to help the company to help me to help the workers the other
six and a half hours, but I\'m not allowed to do that because that\'s
not my job classification. Then I\'m qualified, I can do it, but I\'m
not allowed. . . . M2: What about prevailing wage with unions? M1: What
do you mean? M2: Well, usually non-union companies are\--they gauge
their pay scale to union companies with prevailing wage. So if one day,
if the prevailing wage with union companies\--if it falls and it\'s
gone, then what do you think will happen to the rest of the wages? When
the union prevailing wage is wiped out? In this discussion, participants
actively debated the issue of whether government should support labor
unions; however, they reached no mutual conclusions on the value of
labor unions. Divergent opinions were shared, but no attempt at
consensus building regarding the role of unions in the economy occurred.
Consensus was difficult because [[when one focuses on self-experience,
**it is difficult to transcend those experiences**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
While the conversation raised a number of points on behalf of unions,
the anti-union storyteller continued to return to his story. Habermas
argues that [the public sphere should constitute a discursive space
where individuals \"transcend the provinciality of their spatiotemporal
contexts\"\--a space where citizens engage in \"context transcending
validity claims.\"]{.underline} 39 [**[When citizens ground public
policy discussions in]{.mark} personal [narratives, they]{.mark}
generally [fail to transcend the limitations of their personal lives and
move to a broader social outlook]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is also
interesting to note that in this exchange about unions the personal
narrative goes unchallenged. [Rhetorical theorists have long recognized
that [narratives are susceptible to]{.mark} the charge of
**[ungeneralizable evidence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For instance,
Richard Whatley observed that one must take care in constructing
arguments from examples, because [[examples]{.mark} are perceived as
\"exceptions to a general rule\" and \"**[will not prove the probability
of the conclusion.]{.mark}** While such a perception may prove fatal in
debates between experts in the technical sphere, they do not seem to
have much impact in the deliberative practices of ordinary
citizens.]{.underline} In the foregoing exchange, one participant
recounted his personal experiences with union workers at the Perry Power
Plant. He told the story of union workers who spent endless hours in
idleness or in hiding. While one could certainly challenge the
generalizability of such a story, the other group members did not offer
such challenges. Instead, a pro-union participant shifted the ground of
the debate to the alternative issue of \"prevailing wage,\" where the
discussion died. Perhaps [such **[personal narratives are difficult to
challenge because they establish expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Recent scholarly [outcry suggests that experts have usurped the
public]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 415\]
[[sphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. 41 [Such lamentations are grounded in the
fear that technical expertise undermines citizen deliberation by
devaluing citizens\' views.]{.underline} While this incursion by
technical expertise did find its way into the group discussions
(citizens citing outside \"expert\" sources), personally grounded
expertise, such as the credibility established in the following exchange
from a group in California, appeared far more often: M1: I think they
should really look into the military spending. That is just amazing. I
was in the military, and it\'s just a waste. People just rot in the
military. It\'s just amazing how much unnecessary money is used in the
military, and how many people that shouldn\'t have jobs are in the
military. M2: That\'s the Republican job program. M3: I think you can
say that about any government organization. In this exchange, a
participant recounted his personal experience in the military. [With the
simple statement, \"I was in the military,\" he established expertise in
this realm of public affairs. **[Just as technical expertise quells
discussion, personal expertise has similar
effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this case, the assertion that
\"people rot in the military\" went unchallenged, and [the discussion of
military spending quickly came to an end. Such personal credibility may
also be less assailable than technical expertise because of its deeply
personal nature. [Arguments grounded in technical expertise can be
challenged]{.mark} for their failure to satisfy certain argumentation
standards within a specialized argument field]{.underline}. For
instance, a social scientist\'s findings could be challenged based on a
flaw in experimental design. Such a challenge takes issue with the
findings; it does not fundamentally take issue with the individual.
[**On the other hand, [a challenge to one\'s lived experience is]{.mark}
easily [perceived as a challenge to one\'s]{.mark} life or to one\'s
[character]{.mark}.** Such challenges can only suggest that one is
disingenuous in his or her storytelling or that one\'s lived experience
falls outside the norm. Such challenges seem out of place in a culture
grounded in a liberal political tradition that suggests that one should
not judge others.]{.underline} 42

#### Focusing debates on personal narratives makes them stupid and crowds out solution-driven discussion by forcing personal confrontation and making the process of updating belief systems more precarious.

[How little these narcissistic preoccupations with [the presentation of
the self]{.mark} are able to create an **engagement with
others**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} a **[meaningful
exchange]{.underline}** [wrestling with **problems**]{.underline} [is
**amply demonstrated**]{.underline} [by the slew of sitcoms where the
"lonely" individuals "kvetch" about their unhappiness]{.underline}, the
lack of available women (or men), [or]{.underline} their [boredom, which
they try to self-analyze by a vocabulary picked up from self-help books
or sessions with a "therapist." The captive audience is treated
to]{.underline} the silliest [hurts of their childhood]{.underline},
such as when mother did not let them make mud pies, or took away a toy
from them to give it to their brother. [While this might come across in
a comedy as funny if it is well presented, [as]{.mark} a
"self-advertisement" or [an **offer for genuine communication**]{.mark}
it [is]{.mark} just [**silly** and **boring**]{.mark}. The point here is
[not]{.mark} so much [that the "**themes**"]{.mark} which are offered
[for conversations are mundane]{.mark} but that [the **form of the
communication does not lend itself to establishing**]{.mark} **a
[genuine exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As one of the first reports on
Facebook noted, taking issue with the official version of "bringing
people together": While Thefacebook.com \[the original name of the
platform created at Harvard in 2004\] isn't explicitly about bringing
people together in romantic unions, there are plenty of other primal
instincts evident at work here: an element of wanting to belong, a dash
of vanity, and more than a little voyeurism.56 In a way these
observations seem to corroborate some of the earlier criticism made by
the historian Christopher [Lash]{.underline}57 [and]{.underline} the
sociologist Richard [Sennett]{.underline}, who both [noticed a growing
narcissism in modern culture and saw in this change one of the reasons
for the decline of the public. As Sennett avers with regard to [codes
which **privilege private experiences**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[as]{.underline} **[templates for understanding social and political
life]{.underline}**]{.mark}[: We [see society]{.mark} itself [as]{.mark}
meaningful only in converting it into [a **grand psychic
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We may understand that a politician's
job is to draft or execute legislation but that work does not interest
\... us until we perceive the play of **personality**]{.underline} [in
political struggles]{.underline}. A political leader running for office
is spoken of as "credible" or "legitimate" in terms of what kind of man
he is, rather than in terms of the actions or programs he espouses. [The
obsession with **persons**]{.underline} [at the expense of more
**impersonal relations**]{.underline} [is like [a **filter which
discolors**]{.mark} **our**]{.underline} rational
[**[understanding]{.mark} of society**; \... it [leads us to believe
community is]{.mark} an act of [**mutual self-disclosure**, and to
undervalue]{.mark} the community **[relations]{.mark}** of strangers
\... Ironically, this psychological vision also inhibits the development
of]{.underline} personality [**strengths**, like respect
for]{.underline} the **[privacy]{.underline}** of others, [or the
comprehension that, because every self is in some measure a cabinet of
horrors, civilized relations between selves can only proceed to the
extent that nasty little secrets of desire, greed or envy are kept
**locked up**]{.underline} \... [As a result, confusion has arisen
between **public and intimate life**; people are working out in terms of
personal feelings public matters, which properly can be dealt with only
through codes of impersonal meaning]{.underline}.58 [This becomes
[particularly obvious when the]{.mark} **narcissistic
[display]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[answered]{.underline}]{.mark}**" by the members of the audience
[with a "**shit-storm**," victimizing the original sender, particularly
if s/he displayed some weakness or **flaws**. Here the offer and the
response seem more to be a sign of **dovetailing neuroses**]{.underline}
[rather than the **transmission of actual information**]{.underline}
[that establishes a common concern with the potential of leading to a
communicative engagement. Meaningful communication needs not only
give-and-take among different positions, it also requires the ability to
listen and reflect and thus presupposes a distancing from one's own
notions and prejudices]{.underline}. Here the notion of "interest"
becomes crucial in the two meanings of the term. [First]{.underline}, in
the sense of mihi interest, i.e. [I **communicate** that]{.underline} I
am committed to something and want to send a signal as [I find myself in
a situation that creates some [**unease** or **puzzlement**]{.mark};
this [is why I **address others**. But such a stance **also entails that
I have to be willing to**]{.mark} **be led by my own reflections and
those of others in order to "go on" by [correct]{.mark}ing [my]{.mark}
original ["hunch"]{.mark}**]{.underline} 59 or fears, and tackle a
genuine problem **[[rather than persist in my vague
mood]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is why Hume pointed out the importance
of "commerce and conversation" with others, as it opens a new space
between the interlocutors which is constituted by that which is
"in-between" them (interesse). [It not only implies the imaginative
taking of different positions in the interaction, but, above all, the
presence of **other**,]{.underline} **[different
perspectives]{.underline}**, as suggested by Aristotle. [In short [the
intimacy which]{.mark} the virtual availability of everybody "out there"
conjures up -- and which [narcissistic preoccupations reinforce --
is]{.mark} not just a **pious hope**]{.underline} [but]{.underline}
[**[counter-productive]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[developing good judgment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**[finding
viable solutions for]{.mark} one's [individual or social
projects]{.mark}**. As in the case of "confirmatory research,"
[looking]{.mark} right away [for **approval**]{.mark} **rather than
criticism** and]{.underline} **[help]{.underline}**, [[is choosing the
**wrong tools and strategies for orienting ourselves in this
world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The point here is that [[finding those who
are in sync]{.mark} with our feelings and moods [is not only **difficult
practically**]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- which explains why we are so
easily seduced by our own "projections" -- [there is also the
**conceptual impossibility of bringing everybody**]{.mark} **and
everything [under one tent]{.mark}**. After all, we cannot but notice
that every [inclusion requires exclusion]{.mark}, since concepts have
meaning only when they relate to other concepts and [that means]{.mark}
that **[boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- even if not fixed once and
for all, as the **old ontology** suggested -- **[need to be
drawn]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This realization cuts against the
rationality of trusting a solution which relies on the
**undifferentiated feeling of "togetherness,"**]{.underline} [but also
against the "privatism" (idiocy) of opting for **simple value-maximizing
strategies**]{.underline}, which are **[bound]{.underline}** [to have
**unintended consequences**. Thus a moment's reflection discloses that
e.g. not all actors can maximize e.g. their security at the same time,
as the **security dilemma** indicates. Attempts to do so will court
**disaster** in virtually all cases, so that we have to learn to **live
with certain insecurities**]{.underline} [and we must rather find a
**common, intersubjective understanding** that can **mediate** those
tensions]{.underline}.60

### 1NC\-\--Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism is the *[only]{.underline}* set of values capable of meaningfully criticizing oppression *[and]{.underline}* creating a normative theorization of justice. Democratic idealism at the expense of black folks is a perversion of liberalism's basic values. Their criticism is of *dominant varieties* of liberalism, *[not]{.underline}* its core tenets. 

**Mills 12** (Charles, PhD from the University of Toronto, Distinguished
Professor of Philosophy at The Graduate Center, City University of New
York; "Occupy Liberalism! Or Ten reasons why Liberalism Cannot Be
Retrieved for Radicalism (And Why They're All Wrong)," Radical
Philosophy Review, 15(2), 305-323, 2012)

2\. Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology---I (Macro)

The second point needs to be logically distinguished from the first,
since a theory could acknowledge the social shaping of individuals while
denying that group oppression is central to that shaping. (So #1 is
necessary, but not sufficient, for #2.) The Marxist critique, of course,
was supposed to encapsulate both points: people were shaped by society
and society (post-\"primitive communism\") was class-dominated. The
ontology was social and it was an ontology of class. [Today
[radicals]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[demand a richer ontology that can
accommodate]{.mark} the realities of gender and [racial
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline} also. But [whatever candidates are put
forward, the key claim is that a liberal frame-work cannot accommodate
an ontology of groups in relations of domination and
subordination]{.underline}. To the extent that liberalism recognizes
social groups, these are basically conceived of as voluntary
associations that one chooses to join or not join, which is obviously
very different from, say, class, race, and gender memberships. But
[[this evasive ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which obfuscates the most
central and obvious fact about all societies since humanity exited the
hunting-and-gathering stage]{.underline}---viz., [that they are
characterized by oppressions of one kind or another]{.underline}---[[is
**not a definitional constituent of liberalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} has certainly
[[recognized]{.underline}]{.mark} [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of
[[oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}: the [[absolutism]{.underline}]{.mark}
it opposed [in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries]{.underline}, the
[[Nazism]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Stalinism]{.underline}]{.mark} it
opposed in the twentieth century. [[Liberalism\'s failure to]{.mark}
systematically [address structural oppression]{.mark} in supposedly
liberal-democratic societies [is a contingent artifact]{.mark} of the
group perspectives and group interests privileged by those structures,
**[not an intrinsic feature of liberalism\'s conceptual
apparatus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the preface to her recent Analyzing
Oppression, Ann Cudd makes a striking point: that hers is the first
book-length treatment of the subject in the analytic tradition.\'
Philosophy, the discipline whose special mandate it is to illuminate
justice and injustice for us, has had very little to say about injustice
and oppression because of the social background of the majority of its
thinkers. In political theory and political philosophy, the theorists
who developed the dominant varieties of liberalism have come
overwhelmingly from the hegemonic groups of the liberal social order
(bourgeois white males). So it is really not surprising that, given this
background, their socio-political and epistemic standpoint has tended to
reproduce rather than challenge group privilege.

Consider Rawls, famously weak on gender and with next to nothing to say
about race. Rawlsian \"ideal theory,\" which has dominated mainstream
political philosophy for the last four decades, marginalizes such
concerns not contingently but structurally. If your focus from the start
is principles of distributive justice for a \"well-ordered society,\"
then social oppression cannot be part of the picture, since by
definition an oppressive society is not a well-ordered one. As Cudd
points out, A Theory of justice \"leaves injustice virtually
untheorized,\" operating on the assumption \"that injustice is merely
the negation of justice.\"9 But radically unjust societies---those
characterized by major rather than minor deviations from ideality---will
be different from just societies not merely morally but metaphysically.
What Cudd calls \"non-voluntary social groups\" will be central to their
makeup, so that a conceptualization of such groups must be central to
any adequate account of social oppression: \"without positing social
groups as causally efficacious entities, we cannot explain oppression:\'
Contra the conventional wisdom in radical circles, however, she is
insistent that the ontology of such groups can be explained \"\[using\]
current social science, in the form of cognitive psychology and modern
economic theory, and situat\[ing\] itself in the Anglo-American
tradition of liberal political philosophy.\"9 [Identifying
\"intentionalist\" and \"structuralist\" approaches as the two broad
categories of competing theorizations of social groups, she
recommends]{.underline} as the best option

> [a compatibilist position, holding that while all action is
> intentionally guided, many of the constraints within which we act are
> socially determined and beyond the control of the currently acting
> individual]{.underline}; to put a slogan on it, [intentions
> **dynamically interact within social structures**.]{.underline}\... My
> theory of nonvoluntary social groups fits the description of what
> Philip Pettit calls \"holistic individualism,\" which means that the
> social regularities associated with nonvoluntary social groups
> supervene on intentional states, and at the same time, [group
> membership]{.underline} in these and voluntary social groups [partly
> constitutes the intentional states of individuals]{.underline}.

If Cudd is right, then, [such a theorization can indeed be developed
with-in a liberal framework]{.underline}, [using the resources of
analytic social and normative theory.]{.underline} But [[such a
development]{.underline}]{.mark} of the theory is not merely
permissible, but [[should be seen as mandatory]{.underline}, [given
liberalism\'s]{.underline} ]{.mark}[nominal [commitment to]{.mark}
individualism, [egalitarianism]{.mark}, [universalism, and
meliorism]{.mark}]{.underline}. These values simply cannot be achieved
unless the obstacles to their realization are identified and theorized.
[[Social-democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} (left)
[liberalism]{.underline}, [[feminist]{.mark} liberalism]{.underline},
[[black liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, all historically represent
attempts to take these structural realities into account for the
purposes of rethinking dominant liberalism.\" [They [are attempts
to]{.mark}]{.underline} get right, to [[map]{.mark}
accurately]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} actual [ontology of the
societies]{.mark} for which liberalism is prescribing principles of
justice]{.underline}. What Cudd\'s book demonstrates is that it is the
ignoring of this ontology of group domination that is the real betrayal
of the liberal project. A well-ordered society will not have
nonvoluntary social groups as part of its ontology. So [the path to the
\"realistic utopia\" Rawls is supposedly outlining would crucially
require normative prescriptions for eliminating such
groups]{.underline}. That no such guidelines are offered is undeniably
an indictment of ideal-theory liberal-ism, which is thereby exposed as
both epistemologically and ontologically inadequate. But [that does not
rule out a reconceptualized liberalism]{.underline}, a non-Ideal-theory
**[[liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that, starting from a different
social metaphysic, **[[requires a]{.mark} different [normative strategy
for theorizing justice]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

3\. Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology-11 (Micro)

But (it will be replied) liberalism suffers from a deeper theoretical
inadequacy. Even if it may be conceded that liberal theory can recognize
oppression at the macro-level, [it will be argued that its individualism
prevents it from recognizing how profoundly]{.underline}, at the
micro-level, [individuals are shaped by structures of social
oppression]{.underline}. [Class, race, and gender belongings penetrate
deeply into the ontology of the individual in ways rendered
opaque]{.underline} (it will be claimed) [by]{.underline} [liberalism\'s
foundational individualism]{.underline}.

But what those seeking to retrieve liberalism would point out is that
**[[we need to distinguish different senses of
\"individualism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" [The individualism that is
foundational to [liberalism is a **normative
individualism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as in the Gray quote above),
[which makes individuals rather than social collectivities the locus of
value]{.underline}. But [[that does not require any denial that
individuals are shaped]{.mark} in their character]{.underline} (the
\"second nature\" famously highlighted by left theory) [[by oppressive
social forces]{.mark} and related group memberships]{.underline}. Once
the first two criticisms have been refuted---that liberal individuals
cannot be \"social;\' and that the involuntary group memberships central
to the social in oppressive societies cannot be accommodated within a
liberal frame-work---then this third criticism collapses with them also.
[One can without inconsistency affirm both the value of the individual
and the importance of recognizing how the individual is socially
molded]{.underline}, [especially when the environing social structures
are oppressive ones]{.underline}. As already noted, dominant liberalism
tends to ignore or marginalize such constraints, assuming as its
representative figures individuals not merely morally equal, but
socially recognized as morally equal, and equi-powerful rather than
group-differentiated into the privileged and the subordinated. [But
[this misleading normative]{.mark} and descriptive [picture]{.mark} [is
a function of a political agenda]{.mark} complicit with the status
quo]{.underline}, [[not]{.mark} a necessary implication of
[liberalism\'s core assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A
revisionist]{.mark}, radical [liberalism]{.mark} [would make]{.mark} the
analysis of [group oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the denial of equal
standing to the majority of the population,]{.underline} [and their
impact on the individual\'s ontology]{.underline}, **[[a theoretical
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus Cudd\'s book, after explicating
the ontology of involuntary groups, goes on to detail the various
different ways, through violence, economic constraint, discrimination,
group harassment, and the internalization of psychological oppression,
that the subordinated are shaped by group domination. But
[nothing]{.underline} in her account [is meant to imply]{.underline}
either that they thereby cease to be individuals, or [that their
involuntary group memberships **preclude a normative liberal
condemnation of the injustice of their treatment.**]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--IR Debates Good

#### Debating IR is key to challenge its excesses\-\--IR is reflexive, but will be co-opted by the right absent debate over policy details.

**Reiter 15**, PhD, Professor of Political Science at Emory University
(Dan Reiter, August 2015, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools,"
*War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>)

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign policy choices are
**not sui generis**, there are [patterns]{.mark} across space and time
that [**inform decision-making**. Policymakers]{.mark} recognize this
and routinely [draw lessons from history when making]{.mark} foreign
policy [decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline} As noted below, policymakers in
other areas such as development and public health routinely rely on
broader, more general studies to craft policy. And, [**broader
[scholarship]{.mark}** []{.mark}can **[improve]{.mark}** foreign policy
[performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced by]{.mark} the [ability]{.mark} of
IR academics [to build on]{.mark} their own [work to **predict
outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example forecasting the lengths of the
conventional and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq conflict in the
2000s]{.underline}. But, even if one were to accept the limits of
general work, there is a growing body of academic work that evaluates
foreign policy tools as applied to a specific country or region. These
studies ask questions such as whether: Development projects reduced
insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone strikes reduced insurgent
violence in Pakistan; Development programs increased civic participation
and social capital in Sudan; Building cell phone towers in Iraq reduced
insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate combatants into society in
Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in Liberia increased the
legitimacy of the government there; Road projects in India reduced
insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's failure in Congo;
Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent attacks from militants.
This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective. A third critique is that much of this academic work on
foreign policy tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too
quantitative and technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik
Voeten, [there is a [**danger** in **not appreciating**]{.mark} the
[importance of rigorous research]{.mark} design, including
**sophisticated [quantitative techniques]{.mark}**[, for
**crafting**]{.mark} **effective policy**. Sophisticated
[research]{.mark} design is not the enemy of effective policy, it is
**critically [necessary]{.mark}** for it]{.underline}. Certainly, [the
current [academic focus on]{.mark} building research designs that permit
causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about the
most: [if implementing a]{.mark} certain [policy will cause]{.mark} the
[desired outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or, put differently, [**[bad
research]{.mark}** designs [make for **bad**]{.mark} **public
[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A classic example is school busing. In
the 1960s and early 1970s, some cities adopted voluntary integration
programs for public schools, in which families could volunteer to bus
their children to schools in neighborhoods with different racial
majorities. Policymakers used the favorable results for the voluntary
programs to make the improper inference that mandatory busing policies
would also work. The result was bad public policy and violence in the
streets. [Sophisticated technical [methods]{.mark} can [improve]{.mark}
our ability to make **causal [inferences]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help [[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[**[empirical problems]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Consider that the heart
of successful counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine,
winning the support of the population. [Assessing whether certain
policies do win public support requires collecting opinion
data]{.underline}. A conventional method for measuring popular opinion
is the survey, but of course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas
may be unwilling to reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of
fear for their personal safety. [[Methodologists]{.mark} have
[crafted]{.mark} sophisticated [techniques]{.mark} for addressing this
issue, improving our ability to measure public support for the
government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques have been used
to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.
[Going forward, [we will continue to need]{.mark} advanced
[methodologies to **address**]{.mark} **pressing [policy
questions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Consider the U.S. military's
commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this commitment
will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science that
address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in which
mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective than
male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion in
combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians? [Certainly, **[other areas]{.mark}** of public policy
[understand]{.mark} the **[importance of rigorous research]{.mark}
design**. Economic and development policy communities read the work of
and employ economics Ph.D.s. Policymakers incorporate the findings of
sophisticated studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**, **gender
empowerment**, and **foreign aid**, knowing the best policy decisions
must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}. Or consider
public health policy. [**[Lives]{.mark} are literally [on the
line]{.mark}** as [decision-makers]{.mark} must [make decisions
about]{.mark} issues such as [**vaccinations**,
**nutrition**]{.mark}**al recommendations**, [and **air
quality**]{.mark}. Policymakers know they must use sophisticated
technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other public health
academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}. Critics will argue
that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from contemporary academic
IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics let go of an obsession
with technique, they will then be better able to connect with
policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree that IR
academics need to find ways to communicate their results in clear,
non-technical language. But [the **[tech]{.mark}**nical
**[components]{.mark}** of the work [**need to be there**. Stripping
them]{.mark} out **directly [undermines]{.mark}** []{.mark}the
[ability]{.mark} of the research [to give]{.mark} the **[right]{.mark}**
kinds of policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Let me
conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR [academics have]{.mark} the [potential to
**make**]{.mark} **real [contributions]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the [IR subfield]{.mark}
and its integration of political economy and security, and its ability
to think about structure as well as units, make it **especially [well
positioned to]{.mark} consider these broad questions**.]{.underline} The
ability of IR academics to [[contribute to]{.mark} contemporary [foreign
policy debates]{.mark}]{.underline} is one of many reasons why
[political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield of [IR and
resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions.]{.underline} Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers
need to know their tools. Rigorous [IR research is the **only
way**]{.mark} **to evaluate them effectively**.]{.underline}

#### Debating IR is valuable.

[**[Structured debates]{.underline}** [for
**i**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} courses [[represent a **synthesis**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [active [teaching]{.mark}
methods]{.underline} described here. [[They draw on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[role-playing]{.mark} dynamics]{.underline}** [of
**[simulations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the **narrative
[foundation]{.mark}** of the **case method**, [and]{.mark} a system for
debate]{.underline} and critical analysis [grounded in the
[argumentation]{.mark} literature]{.underline}.

[Structured [debates force students to]{.mark} **define and
[defend]{.mark} policy [positions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that are
**[assigned in advance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this way, [[debates
demand]{.mark} a level of personal engagement in the
process]{.underline}, a [measure of group collaboration]{.underline} on
debate points, [and a [willingness to participate
in]{.mark}]{.underline} a critical [[dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} with
the larger group [[about]{.mark} theoretically significant [policy
questions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Classroom debates are built on the
foundation of a common narrative or background material similar to the
case method. For example, students who are assigned to support the
establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have reviewed
similar materials and issues as have those who must oppose it.
Furthermore, they are encouraged to define the issue, interpret it
through theory frameworks, and prescribe policy options to address
specific, real-world problems.

These exercises are structured according to guidelines found in the
argumentation literature. Students are sometimes assigned roles for
debates in advance, and other times they are forced to defend a position
assigned minutes earlier. Debates run according to the systematized
format of some forensics programs, and discourse is structured in a way
to achieve educational objectives. Students may be motivated by
"winning" some of these debates, but they achieve important educational
objectives in the process (Wood and Rowland-Morin, 1989).
[[Argumentation]{.underline}]{.mark} in this form [can serve as a medium
for]{.underline} both engaged citizenship and **[critical
[think]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** [[about]{.mark} **potential
[solutions]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **contemporary
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But Cox rightly cautions that
[political argumentation should be seen as [a "**normative sphere"**
where there is **less**]{.mark} **absolute [truth than]{.mark}** issues
**subject to [interpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1981:127).

The literature on active teaching and learning stresses that [exercises
should be **designed** and implemented to **fulfill** a set of
**educational goals**]{.underline}. While objectives may vary, these
[[techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} [are]{.underline} generally [designed
to help students [**move** from **theoretical**]{.mark}
discussions]{.underline} in the classroom [[to **real-world**]{.mark}
experience]{.underline}. The incorporation of active teaching and
learning exercises into international relations courses should also take
into account the time requirement and intensity of the exercise, the
amount of student preparation needed, and related resource concerns.
Finally, most successful active teaching approaches include a period for
reflection on theory applications and lessons learned from the
experience. In Kolb's experiential learning preference model, for
example, particular attention is devoted to the importance of reflective
observation about the exercise (Kolb, 1976, 1984; Fox and Ronkowski,
1997; Brock and Cameron, 1999). On a more practical level, debriefing
can provide necessary closure and encourage students toward further
discoveries.

[The [**study** of **ethical dilemmas** in **foreign policy**]{.mark}
can achieve **important educational objectives** in courses on
international relations]{.underline}. First, [ethical dilemmas can be
used to [illustrate]{.mark} the [**complexities** of]{.mark}
contemporary **global [politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Perennial
themes like [the struggle for]{.mark} **state [sovereignty]{.mark}**[,
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and **globalization**]{.underline} [may
be viewed through]{.underline}]{.mark} [the optic of [ethical
debates]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, collaborative learning projects
with defined objectives allow students to explore many avenues in
relating theories to case studies in a highly systematic format.
[[Debates with **assigned roles**]{.mark} also [provide]{.mark} students
with **greater [understanding]{.mark}** [of **diverse
perspectives**]{.mark} on major issues]{.underline}. [They learn more
about the **background** and **orientation** of **key
players**]{.underline} [involved in political discourse]{.underline},
and [[this]{.mark} may promote a **[widen]{.mark}**ing of their
**[worldviews]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, [students can increase
their **communications skills**]{.underline} [through interactions with
their peers in the context of **structured debates**]{.underline}. These
and other objectives are described in practical application below.

#### Scenario analysis unlocks an [intellectual openness]{.underline} to overcome [cognitive biases]{.underline} and incorporate [complementary theories]{.underline} while making research policy-relevant

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point
out, in order [to [**fill the gap** between]{.mark} **IR
[theory]{.mark}** [and **real**]{.mark}**-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of [**intellectual openness**, recognizing]{.mark} both the need for
[**greater flexibility** in]{.mark} the [**theoretical formulations**
and]{.mark} the [**possibility of complementarity** by **other
theories**]{.mark} and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in its ability to **tackle future
events**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight. The underlying logic of forecasting
is to provide predictions about the future by drawing on mathematical
models and big data-sets based on known patterns. Thus, it is not
particularly suitable to accommodate discontinuities. Foresight, as
described above, aims at going beyond existing patterns by developing
alternative futures based on an innovative combination of multiple
driving forces. Its goal is to capture a set of possible futures and
learn from them by examining the causal relations between driving forces
and their different evolutions. By applying scenario approaches,
scholars can thus account for evolving dynamics and discuss such timely
issues as the consequences of Brexit for both British and EU-security,
economics and politics (Brakman, Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus,
2018; Musolff, 2017; Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet,
[scenario analysis offers more than the possibility to talk about the
future.]{.underline} We see a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis
to the range of methods applied by IR scholars. Confronting enduring
assumptions As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think** caused by
the **subconscious**]{.mark} and **simplified information processing of
humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants to **reveal** and
**question convictions** which]{.mark} have **so far [remained
unchallenged]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} to **[question]{.mark} the
[linearity of]{.mark} world
[developments]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [ability of
**reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond linear
patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.
Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both [**innovative** in]{.mark} terms
of [**scholarship**, and **policy-relevant**]{.mark} by [offering a
**reflection**]{.mark} on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline}
Thus, [it can facilitate the **intellectual capability** [to **think the
unthinkable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259). Bringing
forward new research questions [Scenario analysis starts with
**confronting one's enduring assumptions** and **developing multiple
causal possibilities**, through which scholars can potentially discover
topics that have not been examined before. One of the greatest
challenges for any scholar is to identify innovative venues for research
that might bring the discipline forward]{.underline} and advance
publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian terms, such an ability is often
considered an evidence of a progressive research program.10 [Since the
prime feature of scenario analysis is to **detect rapid and significant
shifts** in **trajectories**, or the **forces behind them**, this method
succors]{.underline} when defining new pressing topics for academia. In
particular, as mentioned in the previous section, scenario analysis
enables the detection of both weak signals and wild cards. By drawing
attention to these hitherto overlooked but potentially pressing issues,
[scenario analysis can identify research agendas for **further
investigation**]{.underline} (Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario
analysis seems to be the right tool to **advance innovative research**
since it helps scholars **drive their research into new areas**, away
from moribund topics that have been followed for many
decades.]{.underline} By "identifying questions of likely future
significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6), scenario analysis can
contribute to combatting the proliferation of researchers in fields
occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet or Japan studies in
the United States in the 1980s. At the same time, [[innovative
research]{.mark} topics **[confront]{.mark} the [uncertainties]{.mark}**
[that are **crucial for policymakers** to]{.mark} be [monitor]{.mark}ed
closely.]{.underline} Dealing with the complexity and
interdisciplinarity of real-world issues [Another added value of the
scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in its ability to provide
**comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to **tackle complex
issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the introduction, [the **world's
complexity** combined with **abrupt shifts** poses a challenge for IR
scholarship.]{.underline} The [[possibility to **accommodate multiple
driving forces**, to **take into account different values**]{.mark} they
might take [and]{.mark} finally to **[combine them]{.mark} with each
other** [and **see how they affect the**]{.mark} **dependent
[variable]{.mark}**, [makes]{.mark} the [scenario approach]{.mark} quite
[unique]{.mark}. Traditional IR methods work with a limited number of
independent variables]{.underline}, formulate and test hypotheses
usually based on the relation between a single causal variable and the
dependent variable. Investigating complex causal trajectories is
therefore not possible. Against this background, we agree with Barma et
al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that [**scenarios are highly
apt** for **dealing with complexity** and **uncertainty** and
[providing]{.mark} academia with [a tool for "**actionable clarity** in
**understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary global
[issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1). Moreover, the scenario
approach helps to tackle the challenges of interdisciplinarity that is
tied to complexity. By drawing on the active participation of people
from different disciplines, backgrounds, and with different expertise in
the scenario development process, it brings interdisciplinarity to the
table by default. The key advantage of the approach is that this
[interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior to and during the
research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline} This distinguishes
the scenario approach from other methods that bring interdisciplinary
perspectives together but do not facilitate a discussion between them,
rather letting them passively co-exist. By exploring the dynamics
between seemingly unrelated vectors of change (key drivers), [scenario
analysis can be useful for shedding light on developments that would
have been overlooked by narrower research designs. In **security
studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario analysis can **connect
the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and non-traditional
understandings of security and capture the **interplay of
economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**. Imposing
interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).
[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character. Stepping out of the ivory tower Finally,
[scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars** to
**establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool towards
**more exchange between academia and policy-making** that]{.mark} can
[contribute to a **better understanding between the two**]{.mark}
worlds. For policymakers, it provides the opportunity [to consider
**long-term trends**]{.mark}]{.underline} (an occasion not often found
in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides
insight into which trends are most concerning for policy-makers,
allowing them to check [and]{.mark} ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the
**[relevance of]{.mark} their [research
agendas]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} We acknowledge the difficulty
to engage policy-makers in foresight exercises caused by their
time-constrains and possible lack of interest. Yet, in our experience,
this problem mostly refers to high-level policy-makers. Mid-level and
former officials and policy-makers have more time and willingness to
participate in foresight exercises and contribute equally valuable
perspectives. The participatory character of foresight exercises
facilitates the exchange of views from different stakeholders on an
equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has shown, it has proven to
be stimulating for each of the engaged groups. Moreover, the [**policy
dialogue** benefits from **scenarios' accessibility** to a **broader
audience**. Scenario publications tend to be shorter and easier to read
than the average academic publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008)
rightly notes "a premium on time is a major difference between the two
cultures" of academia and policy-making. Since [scenario publications
are **more suitable** to the **time- and attention-constraints** of many
policy-makers, they improve the accessibility of research findings for
the policy world]{.underline} (Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An
illustrative example is offered by a foresight exercise conducted by the
Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A group of academics, think tank experts
and policy-makers developed scenarios on the future of the liberal world
order that served as raw material for a newspaper from the future titled
"The Aspen Insight" and dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the
presentation of the newspaper catch the attention of many Berlin-based
policy-makers but the "The Aspen Insight" was also attached as a
supplement to the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel, and reached more than
300,000 readers.11 We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added
value of [scenario analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are
interrelated and that their boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we
believe, they [highlight distinct benefits]{.underline} of this approach
[for academics that want to **tackle the challenges of today's world via
their research**.]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--Alt Fails

#### You can't just talk your way out of capitalist desires.

**Fleming and Banerjee, 16**---Professor of Business and Society and
Director of the Modular Executive MBA programme AND Professor of
Management and Director of the Executive PhD program at Cass Business
School, City University London (Peter and Subhabrata Bobby, "When
performativity fails: Implications for Critical Management Studies,"
human relations, 2016, Vol. 69(2), 257--276, dml)

In their influential analysis of Critical Management Studies (CMS),
Fournier and Grey (2000) argue that CMS [scholarship]{.underline} is
driven by three basic principles: denaturalization, reflectivity and
non-performativity. Denaturalization deconstructs the seemingly
immutable 'realities' and 'rationalities' of managerialism while
exposing the wealth of alternatives that reside in the shadows of
organizational life. Reflectivity **[challenges]{.underline}** the
dominance of [**positivism** in]{.underline} the methodologies of
[mainstream]{.underline} management [research]{.underline},
[revealing]{.underline} how all social scientific investigation is
underpinned by **[political assumptions]{.underline}**. Drawing on
Lyotard's (1984) notion of instrumental performativity, [the
principle]{.underline} of nonperformativity [**rejects** the
**means-ends rationality**]{.underline} that governs many organizational
situations, especially [under]{.underline} neoliberal capitalism
characterized by a brazen cost-minimization/ **[profit-maximization
logic]{.underline}** (Fournier and Grey, 2000).

The principle of non-performativity has recently been questioned in a
number of articles published in this journal and elsewhere. These
authors suggest that by **[critically [distancing]{.mark}]{.underline}**
themselves [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[concrete
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}** of managers, researchers [[may
**miss** opportunities to **intervene**]{.mark} and **make a
difference** [for the **better**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in
their influential article, Spicer et al. (2009: 538) argue that [the
principle]{.underline} of non-performativity needlessly isolates CMS
from organizational practitioners. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[fosters]{.underline}]{.mark} a corrosive '[**[cynicism]{.mark}** and
**negativism**]{.underline}' [[where]{.mark}by [scholars ply
**grand**]{.mark} **critical [theories]{.mark}** [that have **little
relevance**]{.mark} to everyday]{.underline} organizational
[challenges]{.underline}. Others similarly maintain that [the
principle]{.underline} of non-performativity fails to offer 'practical'
guidelines for managers (King and Learmonth, 2014); misses crucial
opportunities to 'collaborate' with middle-managers and [**stubbornly
objects** to becoming]{.underline} '**[more relevant to
practice]{.underline}**' (Wickert and Schaefer, 2014: 7); is elitist in
how it ignores practitioner management texts in favour of 'canonical
perspectives' associated with Marx, Foucault and the Frankfurt School
(Hartmann, 2014: 619, also see Clegg et al., 2006).

[These]{.underline} scholars [recommend a **renewed commitment** to
performativity so that critical knowledge can]{.underline} have an
impact on the practices of managers and [lead to **emancipatory
change**]{.underline}. Most assertive in this regard are Spicer et al.
(2009) and Wickert and Schaefer (2014) and their respective notions of
critical performativity and progressive performativity. Both articles
draw upon wider philosophical studies of performativity to discern its
potential for CMS researchers hoping to make meaningful interventions.
In particular, they apply Austin (1963) and Butler's (1990, 1993)
influential insight about the way language creates reality (rather than
just describe it). Armed with this insight, [it is **claimed**
that]{.underline} CMS [researchers can **change**]{.underline}
organizational **[practice]{.underline}** (for the better) [by
**altering**]{.underline} how **[language]{.underline}** is used by
managers. [Modified speech **may** lead to **modified** and thus
**emancipatory behaviour**]{.underline}. Such critical performativity
'involves active and subversive intervention into managerial discourses
and practices' (Spicer et al., 2009: 538). Instead of worrying about
emancipation on a grand scale, more modest microemancipatory practices
might 'stimulate the performative effects of language in order to induce
incremental, rather than radical, changes in managerial behaviour'
(Wickert and Schaefer, 2014: 1). This means getting closer to managers
rather than critiquing them from afar.

We agree that CMS [scholars should be [reflect]{.mark}ing [on
how]{.mark} their critical [findings]{.mark} might **[translate
into]{.mark} concrete [change]{.mark}**[. Otherwise **why
bother**]{.mark} **being critical in the first place**?]{.underline}
Moreover, we applaud recent efforts -- including the advocates of
critical and progressive performativity -- to rethink how CMS research
might make a difference to organizational practices. Our motivation for
entering this discussion, however, derives from a nagging doubt. We are
concerned that [the emphasis on discursive performativity as a change
mechanism risks presenting an [**overly optimistic** view
of]{.mark}]{.underline} (a) [[the power of language to **alter
institutionalized**]{.mark} **organizational [practices]{.mark}**
associated with]{.underline} neoliberal [capitalism
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} (b) [[the capability]{.mark} of]{.underline}
CMS [scholars **alone** [to **reorder**]{.mark}]{.underline} in situ how
managers make sense of [[**governing imperatives** like
**profit-maximization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[shareholder
value]{.underline}**, **[consumer responsiveness]{.underline}** and so
forth. [While there **may** be situations in which critical]{.underline}
and/ or progressive [performativity **may**]{.underline} '**[talk into
existence new]{.underline}** (counterbalancing)
**[behaviours]{.underline}** and practices' (Wickert and Schaefer, 2014:
3), we also propose that, [realistically speaking]{.underline}, [[such
attempts would]{.underline}]{.mark} just as [likely [**fail**
given]{.mark} the **preponderant [pressures of economic
rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline} in many business contexts. Missing in
the aforementioned calls for a wider appreciation of (discursive)
performativity, therefore, are the strict boundary conditions that
Austin (1963) and Butler (1990, 1993, 2010) themselves place around the
notion.

Our article contributes to the ongoing discussion about the challenge of
making CMS performative by addressing two central questions. First,
rather than automatically assume their success, [how might discursive
performative approaches]{.underline} (such as critical and progressive
performativity) [**fail** to enact **desired material changes** and for
what reasons]{.underline}? [Answering this]{.underline} question [will
provide a better understanding of the **practical contingencies** that
can **determine**]{.underline} whether these new performativities are
[the **best method**]{.underline} for endeavouring to influence
organizations. Second, in light of the constraints on the performative
potential of language, what other possible avenues are available to the
CMS community for having an impact (however modest) on organizational
practices and routines?

The article is structured in four parts. First, we provide an overview
of the founding CMS principle of non-performativity and analyse recent
calls for critical research to become more performative, giving
particular attention to the two articles that have recently appeared in
this journal. Second, we identify the circumstances under which it is
more realistic to expect discursive performativity to fail rather than
succeed. Corporate Social Responsibility (or CSR) is here highlighted as
a failed performative in managerial and mainstream discourses. Third,
the article posits alternative methods that the CMS community might use
to help make organizations less exploitative and more equitable. Fourth,
we conclude by discussing the broader role of critique in management
studies at this juncture. Our overall aim is to continue the ongoing
dialogue about performativity in the CMS community and hopefully inform
new avenues to achieve its stated objectives in business and society.

Critical Management Studies and the question of performativity

We will not provide a detailed overview of CMS as that has been done
extensively elsewhere (see e.g. Adler et al., 2007; Alvesson et al.,
2009; Banerjee, 2011a; Fournier and Grey, 2000; Spicer et al., 2009).
CMS is characterized by a diversity of theoretical and philosophical
perspectives. For instance, the 2013 Critical Management Studies
conference held in Manchester comprised of 25 streams involving a wide
range of topics such as critical perspectives on strategy,
globalization, international business, diversity, feminism, race theory,
human resource management, marketing, accounting, postcolonialism,
sexuality, gender, postmodernism and environmentalism. CMS was
established as a division in the Academy of Management in 2008. The
domain statement of the CMS division describes its mission:

CMS serves as a forum within the Academy for the expression of views
critical of established management practices and the established social
order. Our premise is that structural features of contemporary society,
such as the profit imperative, patriarchy, racial inequality, and
ecological irresponsibility often turn organizations into instruments of
domination and exploitation. Driven by a shared desire to change this
situation, we aim in our research, teaching, and practice to develop
critical interpretations of management and society and to generate
radical alternatives. Our critique seeks to connect the practical
shortcomings in management and individual managers to the demands of a
socially divisive and ecologically destructive system within which
managers work. (CMS, 2014)

Thus, CMS challenges the fundamental normative assumption that
managerial notions of efficiency are universally desirable, and that
pursuing profit motives can only lead to positive outcomes for the
workforce and society. Moreover, CMS is driven by the desire (even if it
does not always articulate the means) to transform existing power
relations in organizations with a view to encouraging less oppressive
practices that do not harm social and environmental welfare. As Fournier
and Grey (2000: 16) argue, 'to be engaged in critical management studies
means, at the most basic level, to say that something is wrong with
management, as a practice and body of knowledge, and that it should be
changed'.

Along with de-naturalization and reflexivity, Fournier and Grey (2000)
suggest that the principle of non-performativity is crucial to the CMS
project: What exactly do Fournier and Grey (2000) mean by
non-performativity? Let us imagine a CMS researcher studying changing
employment practices in the United Kingdom. S/he gains access to a
subsidiary of a multinational enterprise that has started to use
zero-hours employment contracts to maximize profits for its parent
company. These contracts have been widely condemned as exploitative and
unjust since they insist employees always be on call but guarantee
zero-hours of paid work (see Guardian, 2013). Our non-performative
orientated CMS researcher would not be interested in generating
knowledge that enables the efficiency and instrumentalization of this
new employment system. Nor would s/he be overly sympathetic to the
operational manager's 'point of view' because employees are so obviously
disadvantaged and suffering as a result. So what is our CMS scholar
seeking to achieve in undertaking this research? Generally speaking,
change hopefully. But here is the nub of the problem. How can critical
researchers make an effective intervention while tenaciously remaining
aloof (both ideologically and practically) of the concrete activities
being described? What aspects of performativity, whether critical or
progressive, can engage with this clearly exploitative practice to
create a fairer outcome? If zero-hours contracts are practices created
by the language of neoliberal capitalism, what other utterances have the
power and agency to counter these practices?

Towards a performative Critical Management Studies?

Recent commentators have addressed questions like these by suggesting
that CMS [scholars must **stop being so negative** about the idea of
working with managers to help bring about **practical
change**]{.underline}. In their strident critique of Fournier and Grey
(2000), Spicer et al. (2009) maintain that,

. . . a potential consequence of holding strong to [the
credo]{.underline} of anti-performativity is that CMS [**withdraws**
from attempts to **engage** with practitioners and mainstream management
theorists]{.underline} who are at least partially concerned with issues
of performativity . . . an anti-performative CMS satisfies itself with
attempts to shock the mainstream out of its ideological slumber through
intellectually 'pissing in the street'. (Spicer et al., 2009: 542)

[Critical scholars should [instead become]{.mark} **actively
[involved]{.mark}** with everyday practitioners and **engage** with the
**language** they use in an attempt [to **construct new
realities**]{.mark} and **opportunities**]{.underline}.

Following Spicer et al. (2009), Wickert and Schaefer (2014: 20) also
implore the CMS community to have 'greater impact on what managers
actually do'. They are concerned that [critical scholars **fail** to
provide]{.underline} '[knowledge for **dealing** with those aspects of
managerial life that have been identified as problematic]{.underline} .
. . [and **overlooks** potential points of engagement]{.underline} with
managers' (Wickert and Schaefer, 2014: 5). Middle-managers in particular
ought to be enlisted by CMS researchers because they are likely to be
less aligned with organizational elites and potentially more sympathetic
with frustrated subordinates to trigger progressive social change. For
this reason too, Hartmann (2014: 626) argues the CMS community could
also engage with managerial texts that are often dismissed in favour of
critical theory, Marxism and feminism, in an attempt to subvert
mainstream approaches and shift the discourse towards more emancipatory
objectives instead. At least managerial texts provide a non-alienating
'vocabulary to think progressively about alternatives without setting
itself against the goals of organizations (i.e. it is not directly
opposed to performative ends)'.

Critical and progressive performativity

To rectify the pitfalls of non-performativity, Spicer et al. (2009)
posit 'critical performativity' as [[a **practical
alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} for CMS scholars. This model of
impact [[can be achieved through]{.mark} an affirmative
stance]{.underline} ([getting **close** to the object of critique to
**reveal points of revision**]{.underline}), an ethic of care (providing
space for management's viewpoint and **[collaborating]{.underline}**
with them [to **achieve emancipatory ends**]{.underline}),
**[[pragmatism]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([being **realistic** about what
can be achieved given **structural constraints**]{.underline}), engaging
potentialities ([leveraging points of possibility for
changing]{.underline} managerial [practices in an [**incremental**
rather than **radical**]{.mark}]{.underline} 'revolutionary'
[manner]{.underline}) and asserting a normative orientation (ideals for
'good' organizational practice).

Three implications of this approach are noteworthy. First, Spicer et al.
(2009) move beyond Fournier and Grey's (2000) Lyotardian
conceptualization of performativity (i.e. input/output maximization) by
drawing on other philosophical traditions that highlight how
language/speech might count as social action (see Gond and Cabantous
\[2015\] for an extended overview of this literature in the social
sciences and philosophy). Austin (1963) and Butler's (1990, 1993) notion
of performative utterances (i.e. words that are also deeds) is
considered especially important in this regard. Rather than functioning
only as a secondary descriptor, language can also perform reality, as
when a judge utters 'I sentence you to . . .' CMS researchers might thus
create equitable organizational practices by intervening in management
discourse and experimenting 'with metaphors that might be floating
around in the organization' (Spicer et al., 2009: 547). Second, an ethic
of affirmation and care implies that CMS ought to listen to management's
side of the story and engage in a 'loving struggle' (p. 548) with their
language rather than simply criticize: 'CMS needs to appreciate the
contexts and constraints of management . . . from this follows some
degree of respect and care' (Spicer et al., 2009: 545). Third, CMS must
[be **less**]{.underline} '**[utopian]{.underline}**' [in]{.underline}
its **[emancipatory ambitions]{.underline}**. [**Incremental** and
[**piecemeal** change is **more doable** given]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[economic pressures]{.underline}]{.mark}** managers confront
[in]{.underline} their [daily routines and practices]{.underline}.

A similar set of reforms are outlined by Wickert and Schaefer (2014) in
their notion of 'progressive performativity'. The weakness of CMS for
them is that [it]{.underline} '[provides **only limited guidance** on
how]{.underline} (**[counterbalancing]{.underline}**) [**values** could
be **embedded**]{.underline} into organizational practices and
procedures in collaboration with, rather than in opposition to,
managers' (Wickert and Schaefer, 2014: 7, emphasis in original). They
too advance a broader understanding of performativity related to
language: 'The performative element, we suggest, requires researchers to
"activate" the language that managers use . . . In that way, CMS
scholars may support managers to "talk into existence" new
(counterbalancing) behaviours and practices' (Wickert and Schaefer,
2014: 3). Two elements of progressive performativity follow from this
proposition. First, through micro-level engagement CMS researchers can
actively ally themselves with selected managers (preferably
middlemanagers) to raise awareness and identify alternative speech acts.
Second, this may lead to reflexive conscientization, whereby scholars
help create discursive spaces 'in which managers are gently "nudged" to
reflect on their actions and the organizational processes to which their
actions relate . . . \[it seeks to\] raise the critical consciousness of
managers' (Wickert and Schaefer, 2014: 3).

This can only be credibly achieved, according to Wickert and Schaefer,
if scholars put aside the classical emancipatory ideals of CMS since
they discourage micro-collaborations with managers, introduce concepts
that alienate practitioners and ultimately make progressive change
seemingly impossible. [[Utopianism]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular,
according to Wickert and Schaefer, [[introduces]{.underline} '**[complex
problems]{.underline}**]{.mark} \[[that]{.underline}\] [fill people with
**anxiety** and **[limit]{.mark}** their [capacity to **think** and
**act creatively**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Wickert and Schaefer,
2014: 14). They [recommend **non-utopian** and]{.underline}
'**[small-win]{.underline}**' [initiatives instead]{.underline},
'[moving forward by actively working towards
**incremental**]{.underline}, [rather than **radical** transformation of
unfavourable social conditions]{.underline}' (Wickert and Schaefer,
2014: 9--10).

Limitations of the new performative turn in Critical Management Studies

Space does not permit a full elaboration of the critical and progressive
models of performativity being recommended to CMS
[researchers]{.underline}. But it is no exaggeration to suggest that the
argumentation involved presents a rather caricatured image of the CMS
community when exhorted to 'overcome its often hypocritical and
unproductive claims that its output has no performative intent
whatsoever' (Spicer et al. 2009: 554). As Alvesson et al. (2009: 10,
emphasis in original) [argue]{.underline},
[non-performativity]{.underline} 'emphatically does not mean an
antagonistic attitude to any type of performing'. CMS [only refrains
from]{.underline} instrumentally contributing to [the **mean-ends
rationality** of corporate managerialism]{.underline}. It is not against
all impact, since that would render its criticism something of a
self-serving exercise that rightly ought to be admonished. Having said
that, [advocates]{.underline} of a new performativity do [have a **good
point** when they highlight the **vagueness** and **ambiguity** around
what **mechanisms** of impact]{.underline} CMS **[actually does
favour]{.underline}**. How can the community help make a practical
difference to organizational life so that they are less exploitative and
more equitable?

Critical and progressive [performativity]{.underline} may hold promise
in this regard. However, we feel these [[models]{.underline}]{.mark} of
influence [carry **overtly optimistic** assumptions about the **power of
language** to change certain structural realities as well as the
**capabilities of**]{.underline} CMS [**scholars** to perform
emancipatory change]{.underline} through discourse and micro-level
engagement. There may certainly be some cases where getting close to
managers, empathizing with their constraints and manipulating their
language may indeed yield the (micro) fulfilment of aspects of the CMS
mission. For example, scholars have engaged with managers in developing
critical perspectives on leadership (Cunliffe, 2009; Cunliffe and
Eriksen, 2011) and promoting reflexivity in managerial practice (Barge,
2004). However, we are concerned that the
[conceptualizations]{.underline} of performativity proposed
[[lack]{.mark} a **realistic [appreciation]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark}
**accumulated social [forces]{.mark}** [guiding]{.mark} organizational
[behaviour in these]{.mark} institutionalized [contexts,
including]{.mark} the **[profit motive]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[shareholder value]{.underline}**, **[cost
[externalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[means-ends
efficiency]{.underline}**]{.mark} and so forth. [While these forces are
**no doubt social** and **linguistically constructed** too]{.underline}
(e.g. see Callon \[2010\] in relation to the economy), [they have also
been **politically** and **institutionally embedded** over time and
**[cannot simply be talked away]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is [these
conditions]{.underline}, we argue, that [**need** to be **taken into
consideration** when **assessing the impact** of]{.underline} CMS
[scholarship]{.underline}. Without a [wider]{.underline} political
[analysis]{.underline} of organizations, institutions and markets, [[the
capacity to **perform economic rationality differently** will be
**limited**, which]{.mark} in turn [**restricts the scope**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} politics, **[[political
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}** and dialogue (see Cochoy et al.,
2010). Hence, [[we]{.mark} would [expect]{.mark} the
mechanisms]{.underline} recommended by [[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}
and progressive [[performativities to]{.mark} **frequently
[fail]{.mark}** rather than succeed]{.underline}.

#### Policy entrepreneurs change structures with embedded agency --individual dissent outside or against structures can't produce new ideas or ideological fissures -- turns the alt and justifies our methodology 

Stacie **Goddard 09**, Wellesley political science professor. 2009.
"Brokering change: networks and entrepreneurs in international
politics", International Theory, 1.2.

[Using network theory, scholars can identify the conditions for both
emergence of entrepreneurs and their success]{.underline}. A [third
theoretical question concerns the mechanisms of political change: how is
it that entrepreneurs affect significant structural change?
I]{.underline}n IR, **[[most scholars look to the individual
level]{.underline}]{.mark}** of analysis to explain entrepreneurial
change. [Rational choice theorists and]{.underline} realists often
[assume]{.underline} that [entrepreneurs succeed when they introduce
ideas and information that help others pursue their
interests]{.underline}. [Many [constructivists]{.mark} [use cognitive
mechanisms to explain how entrepreneurs transform]{.mark} political
[systems]{.mark}: entrepreneurs persuade other actors to accept new
ideas; eventually, these norms are internalized, l]{.underline}eading to
structural change. [In contrast to this emphasis on individual-level
mechanisms, [network theorists argue that entrepreneurs]{.mark}, by
deploying inventive ideas, [can produce]{.mark} [autonomous and
**unanticipated structural effects**]{.mark} **in political
networks**]{.underline}. An entrepreneur\'s actions, in particular, can
have switching effects: depending on how an entrepreneur\'s ideas
resonate within a network of coalitions, they can make certain ties
stronger by resonating with particular coalitions, and sever ties by
appearing dissonant to others.38 Once this switching process occurs, it
alters political networks, and entrepreneurs produce different set of
ties, changing actors, strategies, and issues. [In particular, network
theorists have identified three switching mechanisms - mobilization,
polarization, and yoking - that alter political networks, strengthening
some ties, severing others, and even creating entirely new
identities.]{.underline} First, under some conditions, a broker\'s ideas
lead to mobilization. When a broker\'s ideas resonate within a network,
they activate and strengthen ties between actors. For example, theorists
such as Snow and McAdam show how mobilization facilitates social
movements.39 Similarly, Bismarck\'s manipulation of the \'political
equilibrium\' idea mobilized unlikely alliances, persuading Britain and
Russia that Prussian expansion was legitimate.40 Mobilization is likely
under three conditions. First, a broker\'s idea must be culturally
harmonious. As argued above, networks are not only material; they are
imbued with different understandings, symbols, and collective memories,
and ideas are far more likely to mobilize when they incorporate the
cultural content shared within a political network.41 Second,
mobilization depends on degree centrality: the more dense, or numerous
and stronger, the broker\'s ties, the more likely ideas will activate
ties.42 Increased density, as argued by network theorists, creates
social capital, trust, and generally increases an actor\'s influence
over her audience. Finally, a broker\'s between-ness centrality in the
network affects mobilization.43 If an actor has exclusive ties with a
network, it is more likely her ideas will transform the structure of the
game; in contrast, if multiple brokers compete within a network, then
countervailing appeals can undermine the ideas. In addition to
mobilization, theorists such as Tilly, McAdam, and Sydney Tarrow argue
that entrepreneurs can polarize networks as well. When a broker\'s ideas
fail to resonate with a coalition, this destroys network ties, causing
the \'gravitation of previously uncommitted or moderate actors towards
one, the other, or both extremes\' (McAdam et al., 2001: 321). They use
this approach to explain why some ethnic communities polarize and others
do not. For example, rhetorical competition between communal identities
in Switzerland so polarized ties that by 1845 conservative Catholics and
liberals were facing a civil war (2001: 322). Similarly, after 1916,
Sinn Fein\'s revolutionary rhetoric appeared illegitimate to several
audiences, and thus severed the party\'s ties with British Liberals and
moderate nationalists within Ireland (Goddard, 2006). Not surprisingly,
the conditions that produce polarization are practically the opposite of
those that cause mobilization. First, a broker\'s ideas will polarize
networks if they are culturally dissonant. If a broker use unfamiliar or
illegitimate cultural symbols the new norm will be unlikely to resonate
and be accepted. Second, network sparity makes polarization more likely.
When ties between a broker and other actors are few, sporadic, and
informal, it is likely that dissonant ideas will undercut these ties. At
first glance, these two switching mechanisms may sound similar to basic
coalition theory. Yet there are fundamental differences (Abbot, 1996:
879, 880). Whereas conventional coalition theories emphasize interests
as the motor of political outcomes, network theory provides a structural
explanation of how ideas change political interactions. Moreover,
network theorists emphasize the transformative capacity of
entrepreneurs. A [third switching mechanism is identity creation, known
in the sociological literature as yoking (1996: 879, 880). [With yoking,
a broker\'s ideas do not simply resonate]{.mark} with existing actors.
[An]{.mark} entrepreneur\'s [idea provides a focal]{.mark}
[point]{.mark} [around]{.mark} [which new identities can form]{.mark}
and coalesce]{.underline}: actors themselves can be created and
transformed during the course of strategic interaction. For example,
Tilly argues that claims can reconfigure social ties, demarcating new
fault lines of ethnic identity and collective violence. Similarly, Nexon
and Jackson propose that rhetorical performances both reproduce and
change the boundaries of modern states.44 [Through yoking, entrepreneurs
change political networks, creating new boundaries between self and
other, and at the same time \'producing, reproducing, or destroying the
representations that make groups visible for themselves and for
others\']{.underline} (Bourdieu, 1994: 126**[). [These identities are
not produced by shifts in interests or beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(although certainly structural shifts affect cognitive processes);
rather, [[yoking is possible under]{.mark} two structural
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [the broker must be an identity
bridge: [the actor **must have extremely strong**]{.mark}
**[ties]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} otherwise [disparate
elements]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and thus be able to affect the
identities of his audience]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark}
[these]{.mark} strong [ties, the broker]{.mark} [will have little
influence]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} inventive [ideas]{.mark} [are likely to
fall on deaf ears]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But position is not enough: to
achieve yoking, the content of the ideas **must also be
boundary-shifting**]{.underline}, invoking a new basis of identity that
destroys old boundaries and encapsulates multiple networks. It is this
combination of ideas and their switching effects that explains why
Bismarck succeeded and Napoleon III failed in introducing conservative
nationalism to Europe. In the 1860s, Napoleon III abandoned his
multivocal strategy, which combined dynastic and nationalist elements,
for purely nationalist rhetoric. In a speech to the Corps Législatif in
Paris, he famously proclaimed \'The Treaties of 1815 have ceased to
exist\'.45 Not surprisingly, this rhetoric proved culturally dissonant
to the conservative powers, so much so that it dramatically polarized
network ties. While Napoleon III had long been a central mediator in
Europe, his ties, relations, the Great Powers, were now all but
severed.46 In contrast, Prussian rhetoric - especially Bismarck\'s but
also the language of other Prussian elites - mobilized multiple networks
in their favor.47 Internationally, Bismarck\'s rhetoric mobilized actors
who might otherwise have opposed territorial revision. Britain and
Russia\'s failure to halt Prussia\'s expansion into Denmark in 1864, for
example, has long been noted as a classic case of \'underbalancing\':
why did these two great powers fail to intervene on Denmark\'s side, and
put a stop to the first stages of German Unification?48 Explanations
that focus on power and interests are unconvincing. Not only did Britain
and Russia believe containing Prussia was in their interest, they had
overwhelming power over Prussia, so much so that a threat to intervene
could have prevented Prussian action.49 What can explain these
coalitions are the ideas used to justify Prussian expansion: Prussian
rhetoric mobilized both Russia and Britain. Conservative Prussian
rhetoric resonated with Russia, mobilizing that state. Indeed, it
ensured Russia would not align with Denmark, even though they considered
it in their strategic interest to do so.50 Likewise, despite public
outcry against Prussian expansion, Britain aligned itself with Prussia.
With Bismarck arguing it only hoped to uphold Concert principles,
Palmerston concluded the Prussians were acting legitimately, and England
would not intervene to balance their intervention.51 Perhaps most
notably, Bismarck\'s rhetoric produced domestic switching effects,
yoking together nationalist and conservative networks into a powerful
new German identity. National-Liberals in Prussia and throughout the
Confederation had long considered the conservative Junker aristocracy,
their sworn enemy: no imaginable ties could exist between these
networks. Bismarck\'s bridging position allowed him to strategically
combine nationalist and conservative rhetoric that bridged the
identities of these two groups. As Pflanze argues, \'Bismarck\'s
synthesis became a revolutionary instrument\'.52 The boundaries of
German nationalist identity literally shifted: conservatives now
embraced a concept they once abhorred, while nationalists all but
abandoned their liberal ideology. And \'combined with the Prussian
traditions of autocracy and militarism, German cultural and racial
nationalism became the most potent threat to the stability of the
European order which Western civilization had yet produced\' (Pflanze,
1955: 565). [In sum, [network theory emphasizes structural
mechanisms]{.mark} in its theory of social construction. Such [causal
processes cannot be fully reduced]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the actions of
[the individual]{.mark}; indeed, switching effects are often
unintentional and unpredictable]{.underline}. [While Bismarck\'s
brokerage position might have allowed him to introduce ideas of
conservative nationalism, for example, the new identity this created
would eventually turn against him. Indeed**, it is by capturing these
unintended consequences that network theory can capture how the
micro-action of entrepreneurs translates into macro-outcomes.
[Construction]{.mark} [is]{.mark}, in essence, [a reconfiguration
of]{.mark} social and cultural [ties]{.mark}, [which switches the rules,
outcomes, and even the identities involved]{.mark} in the bargaining
process.**]{.underline} I have argued that network theory produces
powerful insights into entrepreneurs and international change. But
whenever a \'new approach\' is proposed, it is worth questioning the
real value added - what does network theory tell IR scholars that they
could not already discern from existing theories? This conclusion
considers the substantive, methodological, and ontological implications
of a network approach to entrepreneurial politics. Substantive
implications. [An entrepreneur\'s power to produce change comes from her
position as a broker, a bridge between structural holes in
networks]{.underline}. [This conception of entrepreneurial power is
unique, and enables network theory to produce novel hypotheses about
entrepreneurs and political chang]{.underline}e. Some [of network
theory\'s hypotheses compete with traditional accounts of entrepreneurs
in international politics. As noted above, a network approach challenges
those **who reduce Bismarck\'s entrepreneurial success to material power
and interests**]{.underline}. While Prussia\'s accomplishments are
considerable, this traditional account engages in retrospective history.
By the 1870s, Prussia was a powerful actor and Bismarck an experienced
diplomat. At the beginning of Prussia\'s adventures in the 1860s,
however, it was materially weak, both internationally and domestically,
and Bismarck\'s performance so abysmal it was assumed he would soon
become a footnote to history.53 From a network perspective, Prussia\'s
source of power was its position. Bismarck\'s brokerage position gave
the state access to multiple networks, which in turn allowed for
strategic flexibility, the ability to invent new ideas, and the capacity
to diffuse the ideas throughout political networks and induce political
change (Barnett and Duvall, 2005). Not all of network theory\'s
hypotheses about entrepreneurs compete with traditional accounts,
however. Some complement existing explanations of entrepreneurs and
international change. For example, as noted above, Moravscik argues that
in most cases of international bargaining, actors have enough
information to create effective institutions, and do not need an
entrepreneur\'s assistance. Successful policy entrepreneurship is likely
only when actors face severe information asymmetries, and thus
entrepreneurs must \'intervene to overcome bias or inefficiency in the
domestic and transnational coordination of information and ideas\'
(Moravcsik, 1999: 283). Network theory would further specify
Moravscik\'s account, positing that brokers are better positioned to
exploit these information asymmetries: brokers\' ties to several
networks give these actors more information than other actors in the
network, and thus more capacity to act as successful entrepreneurs.
Likewise, network theory augments constructivist theories of
entrepreneurship. Theorists such as Sikkink and Keck have proposed that
an entrepreneur\'s success depends on the content of the norm
introduced.54 Using network theory, constructivists could better specify
the conditions under which the content of a norm matters. As argued
here, while content is critical - an actor\'s ideas must resonate if
they are to be accepted throughout the network - whether or not a norm
is salient depends as much on who is promoting it as the content of the
norm itself. Applications of network theory, thus, cross traditional
theoretical boundaries. [Indeed, network theory might be useful
precisely because it is agnostic about several divisive issues in IR.
The theory here does not mandate that action be strategic or
norm-driven: a broker may act strategically, or her actions may follow a
\'logic of appropriateness\'. It]{.underline} may be the case that IR
theorists will find certain strands of network theory more appealing
than others. While rationalists and realists might prefer approaches
that emphasize the material ties among actors, constructivists will
identify with \'structural constructionist\' variations of network
theory, which detail how discourse and ideas remake existing network
structures (Emirbayer and Goodwin, 1994). In any case, network theory
can produce novel explanations of entrepreneurial behavior and
international politics. Methodology and methods. Because the goal of
this paper is theory development, the evidence used here is only
illustrative. While this limitation is necessary, given the essay\'s
scope, it also raises some serious methodological questions regarding
network theory. For instance, can network theory truly identify
potential entrepreneurs ex ante? Would network theory identify Bismarck
or Napoleon as entrepreneurs if they had not engaged in entrepreneurial
behavior? Likewise, is the \'fragmentation\' discussed in this paper
really a network measure, or does it simply reflect the fact that
entrepreneurs were active during the late nineteenth century? More
generally, is network theory too complex to be tested empirically? There
is much at stake in these critiques. If entrepreneurs cannot be
identified apart from entrepreneurial behavior, then it falls victim to
the same tautology that plagues other theories of entrepreneurs. If
network theory is too complex, then researchers risk a \'kitchen sink\'
approach to history, and the theory itself will prove unfalsifiable.
There is no doubt that the methodological challenges confronting network
theory are daunting - but no more so than those that confront
traditional theories. IR scholars have long attempted to measure
\'intentions\' without much certainty about what is really in people\'s
heads, and have proposed concepts of \'structure\' and \'culture\' that
fall prey to the same criticisms above. In other words, the obstacles
network theorists face are not unfamiliar; they are endemic in social
science. And like other approaches, network theorists must carefully
develop stringent data collection and testing in order to avoid
tautological and unfalsifiable theories. In particular, identifying
brokers will require moving away from conventional measures and data
collection in international politics. Network theory relies not on
traditional measures of material power, actor\'s interests, or norms,
but instead seeks to map network positions and structural holes. There
are studies in IR that have already done this, and thus provide a
template for developing rigorous research designs. Some scholars proceed
qualitatively, using documentary evidence to map networks in precise
detail. Nexon uses an extensive secondary literature to model European
dynastic networks, and in his study of imperial rule, Paul MacDonald
(2007) draws on primary documents - in particular colonial
correspondence - to map concrete relations between core and periphery.
Some quantitative studies use proxies to indicate relations. For
example, Emilie Hafner-Burton and Alexander Montgomery (2006) use
intergovernmental organization membership as a proxy for relations among
actors, using this membership data to map structural equivalence and
prestige effects in the international system. In sum, while the
challenges confronting a network approach might be daunting, the payoffs
are new measures of power and influence, and new hypotheses about how
position affects action in international politics. Ontological: the
agent-structure problem revisited (again). Finally, network theory has
implications for how IR theorists address the agent-structure problem in
IR. [[At the heart of]{.mark} entrepreneurial [action is a paradox: if
structures influence]{.mark} actors\' [interests,]{.mark} even their
identities[, how then do actors introduce new ideas]{.mark}, and get
others to adopt them]{.underline} (Garud et al., 2007: 961)? [As argued
above, [the answer]{.mark} network theory offers to this paradox [is one
of \'embedded agency\': it sees agency as \'not opposed to, but
constituent, of structure\'.55]{.mark}]{.underline} The possibility of
agency inheres within structures: network structures provide actors with
the resources to transform their own environment. [Certainly network
theory is not the only way in which to conceptualize embedded
agency]{.underline}. Anthony Giddens\' structuration theory, which Wendt
invokes in his influential 1987 article, argues that structures \'are
both the medium and the outcome of the practices which constitute social
systems\' - agency is conditioned by structure, even as agents reproduce
and transform their environment.56 Likewise, some IR theorists use
Pierre Bourdieu\'s concept of habitus to conceptualize embedded agency -
actors may improvise, even act strategically, but they are constrained
by structures instantiated in mental schema.57 Network theory embraces
this same \'non-reductionist\' approach to agent-structure issues. Yet[,
unlike Giddens, network theorists suggest mapping out abstract
structures as the concrete relations among actors. Likewise, unlike
Bourdieu, network theorists propose that actors in particular positions
can, if not escape \'habitus\', at least take advantage of the friction
inherent in contradictory networks.]{.underline} While embedded agency
might sound agreeable, there are costs to adopting this approach.
Because it takes into account agency and structure, a network approach
is less parsimonious than other theories of international politics.
Because of this, some network theorists have returned to reductionism
(Emirbayer and Goodwin, 1994). For example, some theorists do abandon
agency, treating their actors as automatons responding to structural
constraints. Similarly, there are theorists who examine only material
attributes of networks, while others analyze cultural relations (1994).
But while parsimony is tempting, reductionism would inhibit an analysis
of entrepreneurs.58 **[[It is not just that structure and agency are
both important; they are absolutely necessary to explain how
entrepreneurs operate. Without an account of structure, there can be no
understanding of how entrepreneurs emerge, and why some actors are
better entrepreneurs than others]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Without agency,
the entire meaning of \'entrepreneur\' disappears, and entrepreneurs
become mere echoes of structural constraints.

#### Globalization is [immensely beneficial]{.underline} for improving [quality of life]{.underline} in the [Global South]{.underline}\-\--it's also [widely supported]{.underline} which proves their [epistemic skepticism]{.underline} is from an [ivory tower]{.underline}.

**Horner et al. 18** (Rory, Global Development Institute, University of
Manchester, Manchester, UK, "Globalisation, uneven development and the
North--South 'big switch'," Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and
Society 2018, 11, 17--33 doi:10.1093/cjres/rsx026)

[Citizen surveys further reveal dramatic changes in attitudes to
globalisation across and within the global North and South]{.underline}.
While such surveys have methodological limitations,1 the results
indicate distinctive trends that support the thesis of the 'big switch'.
[[Among people in the global South, polls]{.mark} have **[consistently
found]{.mark}** quite [**positive attitudes** towards
globalisation]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2007, the Times of India claimed
that 'Indians believe globalisation benefits their country', citing a
poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and World Public Opinion
that 54% of Indians answered 'good' compared to 30% 'bad' to the
question of whether increasing economic connections 'with others around
the world is mostly good or bad'. More recently, Stokes (2016) reported
on Pew Research Surveys from 2016 which found that 60% of Chinese think
their country's involvement in the global economy is good (compared to
23% who think it is bad), while 52% of Indians surveyed thought it was
good compared to 25% who said it was a problem. A recent YouGov survey
of 20,000 people across 19 countries found a majority believed that
globalisation has been a force for good. That survey found the most
enthusiasm for globalisation in East and South-East Asia, where over 70%
in all countries believed it has been a force for good. The highest
approval, 91%, was in Vietnam, a relative latecomer to globalisation
(Smith, 2017).

By contrast, public support for globalisation in the global North has
plummeted. Bhagwati (2004) cited an Environics International Survey
presented at the 2002 World Economic Forum Meetings to argue that
disillusionment with globalisation was not universal;
'anti-globalisation sentiments are more prevalent in the rich countries
of the North, while pluralities of policy makers and the public in the
poor countries of the South see globalisation instead as a positive
force' (2004, 8). Although Bhagwati suggested this was an 'ironic
reversal', it proved to be in line with a 2007 BBC World Service poll
that found 57% of people in G7 countries thought the pace of
globalisation was too rapid, whereas the majority of those in
~~developing~~ countries surveyed thought it was just right or too slow
(e.g. IMF, 2008; Pieterse, 2012). A 2007 Pew Global Poll similarly found
a decline in the percentage of people in many Northern countries who
believed trade had a positive impact. In its analysis of the survey
results, Kohut and Wilke (2008, 6--7) commented that 'it is in
economically stagnant Western countries that we see the most trepidation
about globalisation'. Almost 10 years later, The Economist (2016)
reported on a YouGov survey of 19 countries, which found that fewer than
half of people in the USA, UK and France believed that globalisation is
a 'force for good' in the world. This broad change in attitude toward
globalisation is playing out in national electoral politics as well as
gatherings such as the World Economic Forum and the meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.

The 'big switch' and the geography of uneven development

The 'big switch' seemingly confounds the predictions of the most vocal
proponents and critics of globalisation alike. Uneven development is
dynamic and relates to differences both within and among countries
(Sheppard, 2016). Naïve claims that the world is flat or that economic
globalisation is 'win-win' have rightly been dismissed (Baldwin, 2016;
Christopherson et al., 2008; Turok et al., 2017), yet [[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**insufficient** to suggest]{.mark} that
[globalisation]{.mark} simply [leads to]{.mark} a [**reproduction**
of]{.mark} existing **[inequalities]{.mark}**, overlooking how that
**unevenness** may be changing as a result of new macroeconomic
geographies]{.underline} (Peck, 2016). While trade theory could predict
that there would be 'losers' in the global North from international
economic integration, proponents of economic globalisation have asserted
that they would be few in number and could be compensated. More
recently, it appears that a large group of people feel more forsaken
than compensated. Similarly, [[for those who embraced Marxian political
economy]{.mark}, and warned of its **negative consequences** in the
South, the **[apparent optimism]{.mark}** and **support [for
globalisation]{.mark}** [in the South may have been
**unexpected**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The sceptical internationalists
(e.g. Evans, 2008; Kaplinsky, 2001; Stiglitz, 2006) should be
acknowledged, however, for forecasting downsides in the global North. As
we outline below, many people in the global North have experienced
relative stagnation, whereas, albeit from a very low starting point and
amidst considerable inequality, [[many]{.mark} people]{.underline} (but
not all) [have [experienced **improved development outcomes**]{.mark} in
the global South]{.underline}. We then explore what this apparent 'big
switch' may tell us about contemporary economic globalisation.

The new geography of global uneven development

Significant portions of the population in the USA and other countries in
the global North have experienced limited, if any, income gains in an
era of globalisation. Milanovic's (2016) 'elephant graph' (Figure 1) has
quickly become a popular way to demonstrate the relative stagnation
experienced in North America and Europe in recent decades. Exploring
changes in real incomes between 1988 and 2008, he showed that those who
particularly lost out on any relative gain in income were the global
upper middle class (those between the 75th and 90th percentiles on the
global income distribution) and the poorest 5% of the world population.
Of these least successful percentiles, 86% of the population were from
mature economies in the global North (Lakner and Milanovic, 2016, 23).
Considering these contrasts more widely, [a growing body of evidence
shows that [the]{.mark} global **[North's dominance]{.mark}** in the
global economy [is **receding**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the share of
high-income countries in global GDP having fallen from 76.8% in 2000 to
65.2% in 2015 (see Figure 1).

A different picture emerges in the global South. In Figure 1, it was
[Asians]{.underline} who [comprised 90% of the population in the
percentiles which did best in terms of relative income gains from 1988
to 200]{.underline}8 (Lakner and Milanovic, 2016, 223). The UNDP has
remarked that

A striking feature of the world scene in recent years is [the
transformation of many]{.underline} ~~developing~~ [countries into
dynamic economies...doing well in economic growth and trade ... they are
**collectively bolstering** world **economic growth**, lifting
other]{.underline} ~~developing~~ [economies, reducing poverty and
increasing wealth on a grand scale]{.underline}. (UNDP, 2013, 43)

[The share of global GDP of low and middle income countries increased
from 22.5% in 2000 to 34.1% in 2015]{.underline} (Figure 2). [Much of
this increase is accounted for by China, as well as India and
Brazil]{.underline}. Their share of global GDP, only 4.6% in 1960, 6.6%
in 1990 and 9.3% in 2000, had almost doubled in the 21st century to 18%
by 2015.

[The development context of the global South has **changed
significantly** since the turn of the Millennium, across a variety of
important indicators. The total number of people in the world living on
less than \$1.90 per day (i.e. [**extreme poverty**) has more than
**halved**]{.mark} from 1.69 billion in 1999 to 766 million in
2013]{.underline}. At least by official estimates, [the share of the
population in the global South who are living in extreme poverty has
**fallen considerably** this century]{.underline}. Whereas the
percentage of the population in the global South with a daily
consumption level of less than \$1.90 was 33.4% in 1999, it was just
13.4% in 2013.2 [The percentage of the world's countries classified by
the World Bank as low-income]{.underline}, albeit a very low threshold,
[**more than halved** within the first 15 years of the 21st
century]{.underline}. Moreover, [the total number of countries which are
highly dependent on aid]{.underline} (having a net ODA \> 9% of GNI)
[has **fallen considerably**, from 42 in 2000 to 29 in 2015, or from
34.1% to 23.2%]{.underline} of all low and middle-income countries with
data available over that period.3

Considered overall, in comparison with the 1990s, [[the global
South]{.mark}, in aggregate, now [earns a **much larger share** of
**world GDP**, has]{.mark} more middle-income countries, more
middleclass people, **[less aid dependency]{.mark}**, considerably
[**greater life expectancy** and **lower child**]{.mark} and **maternal
[mortality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Table 1 provides some summary
indicators for high-income countries (HICs) and low and middle-income
countries (L&MICs), as somewhat imperfect approximations for global
North and South.

[[After two hundred years of a 'divergence]{.underline}]{.mark}, big
time' (Pritchett, 1997) between developed and ~~developing~~ countries
following the Industrial Revolution, [[recent measurements suggest a
**change**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the **pattern** of [**global inequality**
across a number of indicators]{.mark}]{.underline} (Horner and Hulme,
2017). [The Global GINI of **income distribution** across all
individuals in the world has **fallen** from 69.7 in 1988 to 66.8 in
2008 and 62.5 in 2013]{.underline} (World Bank, 2016, 81). Analysis
presented in the World Bank's Taking on Inequality (2016) suggests that,
[in 1998, 26% of global income inequality was related to differences
within countries, with the remaining 74% relating to differences among
countries. By 2013, these shares were 35 and 65%. Two hundred years of a
**great divergence** between global North and South now seems to have
had some **reversal**]{.underline}, although more than half of an
individual's income can be accounted for by the country where he/she
lives or was born (Milanovic, 2013). [Inter-country
**inequality**]{.underline}, rather than intra-country inequality, is
still dominant, but it [accounts for a **diminished share** of
income-based and other inequalities]{.underline} (World Bank, 2016).

For example, take India. Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramanian, in [a 2004
paper about India's growth
surge](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/staffp/2004/00-00/rodrik.pdf),
write the following:

Most conventional accounts of [[India's]{.mark} recent economic
[performance]{.mark}]{.underline} associate the pick-up in economic
growth with the liberalization of 1991. This paper demonstrates that the
transition to high growth occurred around 1980, a full decade before
economic liberalization. We investigate a number of hypotheses about the
causes of this growth---favorable external environment, fiscal stimulus,
trade liberalization, internal liberalization, the green revolution,
public investment---and find them wanting. We argue that growth [[was
triggered by]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[attitudinal
shift]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on the part of the national government
[towards a **pro-business**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as opposed to
pro-liberalization) [[approach]{.underline}]{.mark}. We provide some
evidence that is consistent with this argument. We also find that
registered manufacturing built up in previous decades played an
important role in influencing the pattern of growth across the Indian
states.

In other words, [India didn't just liberalize things]{.underline}; [it
implemented its **own version** of a **development state**]{.underline},
and prospered as a result. [[The same is true of]{.mark} Southeast
Asia]{.underline}, [where [Malaysia]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[Thailand]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} to a lesser degree
[[Indonesia]{.mark} have emerged [as **success

Vietnam's recent growth for another example.

In Latin America, it's true that the Washington Consensus [slowed down
structural change and productivity
growth](https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2010/06/the-most-telling-chart-i-have-seen-in-a-long-time.html).
But that doesn't mean Latin American governments had no role in reducing
poverty. Bad advice may have held back the development state in [[Latin
America]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [governments there [have engaged
in]{.mark} **extensive [redistribution]{.mark}** [and **better

A [series](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2304715)

these policies. [[Inequality]{.mark} in Latin American countries [fell
**substantially**]{.mark} during the 2000s:]{.underline}

Lustig et al. find that roughly half of this was due to government
transfers and pension policies, while the other half was due to
increasing incomes for workers at the bottom of the distribution ---
which in turn was due to better education. So [Latin American
governments]{.underline}, though they didn't pursue the kind of
manufacturing-intensive, export-led development policy used by many
Asian countries, [did manage to **cut poverty** with **government

The political lesson they draw is that '[the requirements of genuine
belief show that we must, broadly speaking, be **democratic inquirers'**
(]{.underline}Misak, 2000: 106). [A true belief is one that is
responsive to, and best fits with, all reasons, arguments and
experience.]{.underline} If we want true beliefs, [**we should test
epistemic claims against as wide a range of different experiences as
possible**, rendering beliefs **responsive to reasons and evidence**,
and anyone genuinely committed to having true beliefs is committed to
exercising the epistemic virtues this requires.]{.underline} Since [we
need access to evidence, arguments, other forms of information, and
processes of reason-exchange,]{.underline} it follows that [we need to
live in a social and political order that protects and promotes this
openness for all]{.underline}: just 'as the physicist who refuses to
take seriously the results from, say, Finnish labs is betraying that his
beliefs are not aimed at truth, [the citizen who refuses to take
seriously the experience of a minority is betraying that his beliefs are
not aimed at truth]{.underline}' (Misak, 2019: 1066). In this way, the
commitment to arriving at and sustaining true beliefs entails that we
should support a democratic ethos and institutions and is [meant to have
a critical force]{.underline}: in Talisse\'s words, 'each person has
compelling epistemological reasons -- simply in virtue of the fact that
\[they hold\] beliefs -- to [embrace social and political
norms]{.underline} best secured within a democratic order' (Talisse,
2009: 37). The alternative is to admit that we are only specious
believers.

Privacy "Why am I compelled to write? Because the world I create in the
writing compensates for what the real world does not give me. By writing
I put order in the world, give it a handle so I can grasp it. I write
because life does not appease my appetites and anger. To become more
intimate with myself and you. To discover myself, to preserve myself, to
make myself, to achieve self-autonomy. To dispel the myths that I am a
mad prophet or a poor suffering soul. To convince myself that I am
worthy, and that what I have to say is not a pile of shit. Finally, I
write because I'm scared of writing, but I'm more scared of not
writing." -- Gloria E. Anzaldúa (2015, p. 169) We begin by locating our
work within the autoethnographic tradition. We are four black, Indian,
Chicanx scholar activists with transnational histories that span India,
Jamaica, México, South Africa, North America. and the United Kingdom. We
write from these identities. Ellis and Bochner (2000, p. 733) defined
the term auto- ethnography as "an autobiographical genre of writing and
research that displays multiple layers of consciousness, connecting the
personal to the cultural." Among the multiple ways of understanding
autoethnography then, we align ourselves with Stacy Holman Jones (2005,
p. 765) who defines the concept thus: Autoethnography is a blurred genre
. . . a response to the call . . . it is setting a scene, telling a
story, weaving intricate connections between life and art . . . making a
text present . . . refusing categorization . . . believing that words
matter and writing toward the moment when the point of creating
autoethnographic texts is to change the world. (emphasis added) [Our
utopian desires demand a break from the imprisonment of categorization,
the centering of the personal in relation to the social, and the desire
to change the world]{.underline}. As minoritized and marginalized beings
in the world, [we find little resonance with]{.underline} ameliorative
change and [methodological approaches that valorize the old. Brutalized
in the past and present, our hope can only be in a radically altered
future where our full humanity can find expression and
affirmation]{.underline}. Autoethnography therefore suits our purpose
for radical dreaming in the traditions of Sylvia Wynter and Audre Lorde.
It allows us to center ourselves, not as marginal and fractured but as
whole and important. As a methodological approach for telling stories,
refusal, and creative expression, autoethnography is a viable time
machine that we can [fashion for our needs for a different
future.]{.underline} In this paper, we propose retrospective
autoethnography as [a methodology for decolonial moves, in critical
solidarity with student movements around the globe pushing for
decolonizing the university]{.underline}. While we are inspired by
autoethnography, our proposed methodology is distinct. Instead of
situating the autobiographical past into the present, [we insert
ourselves into a utopian future to create the conditions for rewriting
and hence re-experiencing the prese]{.underline}nt. We do not ask
whether there is a place for us in the neoliberal academy where
knowledge is instrumentalized in the pursuit of capital accumulation.
Instead, [we engage in a mindful and intentional exercise of militant
utopianism]{.underline} (Denzin, 2009) -- struggling [to visualize
ourselves in the New University, and writing from a place of emotional
and intellectual emancipation. We engage in a politics of militant
utopianism through the daring, defiant act of not only writing our lived
experience into ongoing conversations about the academy, but also
decolonially dreaming and reimagining the
university-as-public-good]{.underline} (Santos, 2010). We ask, what will
it mean to be part of an academy that does not demand unwavering
institutional and disciplinary allegiance, that does not invisibilize at
the same time as it surveils, audits, and disciplines us? [Together, as
people raised in the post-colony and within coloniality (the neoliberal
university as an iteration of colonialism), our decolonial intervention
begins at this negative affect but then strives to imagine a New
University characterized by radical hope.]{.underline} We recognize that
[the desire to heal from the wounds of the neoliberal university via
radical imaginings is a collective project]{.underline}. Therefore,
rather than enumerating guidelines or prescribing solutions, we exhort
readers to join us in our aspiration to dream a New University into
place. Together, we hope [to build our capacities to listen and to think
with our stories, to envision, imagine, and enact alternatives to
oppressive paradigms that reduce human life and meaning to economic
transactions.]{.underline} We endeavor [to step outside the parameters
of what and who is valued and counted.]{.underline} We refuse to be
restrained by colonial anchors of what is "practical" (for whom?) and to
be assuaged by the ameliorative politics of incremental progress. Even
as we allow ourselves to imagine the New University, [radical hope and
decolonial dreamings are difficult in the face of our fraught everyday
lives and liminal existence in neoliberal institutions and
disciplines.]{.underline} We ask, is it possible to reclaim what the
neoliberal university has wrenched away from us? What would it mean to
rewrite ourselves and the academic spaces we inhabit, however
precariously? [The productive tension between experiential "problems"
and the imagined utopian university, mirrored in the ebb and flow of
this paper, is integral to radical imagination.]{.underline} In the
section that follows, we journey back to autoethnography, to further
detail its implications for the radical dreaming that defines our
proposed methodology -- retrospective autoethnography. We then share our
stories: fleeting images of the New University and the desire it sparks;
the pain of being "the other" even as we resist and leverage our
liminality; naming "private" pain in a deliberate move towards healing
and imagining a decolonial reality. Finally, we share some fledgling
ideas on how to invent the New University. We honor our stories and
struggles and recognize the time and labor this project entails.
Therefore, we envision this article as part one -- an invitation to come
together in critical solidarity, armed with compassion, care, love, and
the desire to heal from the wounds of the neoliberal academy. Our hope
is that we will return with part two -- where [we would not only share
our utopian imaginations of the new university but also elaborate,
illustrate, and simultaneously trouble]{.underline} retrospective
autoethnographies [as a method of utopian imagining and decolonial
action.]{.underline}

### FW \-- Scenario Planning

#### Scenario planning is good -- a model of dialectical negation enables the transcendence of entrenched political ideologies and trains debaters to imagine radical alternative worlds guided by pragmatic strategy -- their author concedes we're right.

**Ossewaarde '17** \-- Associate professor in governance, society and
technology, University of Twente (Marinus Ossewaarde, 7-21-2017,
"Unmasking scenario planning: The colonization of the future in the
'Local Governments of the Future' program", Futures, Volume 93, pg.

[Scenario planning can be understood as a dialogical enterprise or
'dialectical negotiation']{.underline} (Bowman 2016: 90). It therefore
[involves the 'art of friendly dispute' or 'clash of minds', which in
turn enables the critique, negation, and transcendence of established
ideologies, imaginaries and frames that determine the present and
future. Scenario planning is a quest for alternative]{.underline}, still
to be decided, [open futures, in which different understandings of the
world are reconciled]{.underline} through compromises. Chosen courses of
actions informed by various (conflicting) possible scenarios reflect
such compromises. As Habegger (2010: 51) emphasizes, in scenario
planning 'there is no such thing as "the future".' [Clashes between
ideologies, imaginaries and frames, accordingly, are not problems a
scenario planning must get rid of; instead, they must be embraced as a
sine qua non for advancing the knowledge of futures, if only because
such contradictions or different intellectual orientations increase the
awareness of possible future worlds]{.underline} (cf. Mannheim 1954:
241). [There is no one necessary or inevitable path to one future. A
scenario planning is a dialectical process involving the creative quest
for futures]{.underline} (Barber 1998). Contemporary scholars therefore
draw a parallel between scenario planning and the writing of futuristic
stories (Korte and Chermack 2007). Science fiction, for instance, is
widely recognized as a valuable asset for envisioning undetermined or
undecided futures and stimulating utopian (or, dystopian) enquiries
(Birtchnell and Urry 2013). Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George
Orwell's 1984 are examples of literary works that provide the
imaginative component of scenario planning (cf. Schulz, 2015: 133). The
purpose of scenario planning is, of course, not to produce science
fiction-like stories as such; 'scenarios are far more than stories'
(Chermack and Coons 2015: 189). Instead, [scenario planning generates
scenarios that are not simply linear extrapolations of the present. It
involves reckoning with -- imagining -- unpredictable or possible
events. The resulting scenarios, in turn, entail and demand a wide range
of policies hitherto unheard of]{.underline} (Volkery and Ribeiro 2009;
Habegger 2010[). The imaginative part of scenario planning is therefore
intimately connected to world-making, to decisions and strategic
actions, which are directed to changing the course of
history]{.underline} (Korte and Chermack 2007; MacKay and McKiernan
2010; Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013). Along this line, [scenario planning
always involves and requires (1) new imagination of future worlds, (2)
debate about alternative futures, and (3) the creation of manoeuvring
room for strategic actions that correspond to different
scenarios]{.underline} (Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Volkery
and Ribeiro 2009). The imagination of future worlds is enabled by
literary methods that evoke distrust of fixed images and iconic
representations (Shapiro 2016). Hence, parables, the articulation of
paradoxes, allegories, symbolisms, and metaphors make it possible to
understand and reckon with ambiguous, elusive, or latent (not yet fully
manifest) phenomena in scenario planning (Levine 1985: 29; 218).
Literary methods, and writers (poets in particular) can inspire truly
new insights and strengthen the belief in different possible worlds,
past, present and future. In other words, in these works, the reader
comes to the realization that what is, or what has passed, could have
been different; or what possibilities have been missed (MacKay and
McKiernan 2010; Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015; Shapiro 2016). From such
literary angle[, futures unfold when events -- which may be the results
of strategic decisions -- rupture ongoing trends and disrupt established
patterns.]{.underline} In contrast with trends, events happen suddenly
and can evoke shocks (MacKay and McKiernan 2010; Schulz 2015). A
scenario planning has to include the possibility of such surprising
historical moments through organizing so-called 'what if' scenarios, and
must, accordingly, be organized in 'an atmosphere detached from daily
routines' (Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015: 265). In this way, the enthusiasm
for and openness to unexpected events, for ungrounding the present and
the emergence of newness and radical transformations, is not stifled.
[The imagination of futures beyond current trends require a particular
kind of radicalism from participants in the scenario planning process,
namely, the transcendence of their current assumptions regarding the
world.]{.underline} In other words, their capacity to invent new futures
depends on their willingness and capacity to critically re-examine what
they conceptualized as trends that would continue into the future
(Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016;
Bowman 2016). They must, accordingly, abandon any pretence of knowing
the 'laws' of the world, thereby leaving open the possibility that the
world might have been very different if other power constellations had
been in place. Concretely, [such attitude requires giving up biases,
dogmas, ideological distortions, and compulsive identifications with a
particular (well-known) order, stereotypes, and clichés. Indeed, it is
only through the critique, negation and transcendence of established
conceptual frameworks, practices and current policies that it is
possible to generate new ways of seeing the world, and hence to envision
alternative worlds (]{.underline}Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013).
Ideological discourses freeze (reify) established patterns (typically
described as 'progress,' 'development,' or 'transformation') and obscure
ambiguities. Scenario planning results in increased scope for strategic
action to realize undetermined possible futures. Though it tends to
limit itself to descriptions of alternative futures (Amer, Daim and
Jetter 2013; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016; O'Brien 2016), without
prescriptive claims, it is a powerful instrument that can serve or
undermine democracy and its future (Barber 1998). Its liberating
potential depends on the range of different accounts of the world and of
possible future worlds that is taken into account during the process.
The exclusion of alternative images of the future on the basis of
current assumptions and beliefs -- for instance, the salvation of the
world lies in technology -- from scenario planning makes the latter a
sham. Since the inclusion of conflicting worldviews is the hallmark of
democracy, [a pseudo-scenario planning that presumes and legitimizes one
desirable future clearly undermines the democratic ideal of debate or of
the publics]{.underline} (cf. Ravetz, 2011).

[[Every policy is a **prediction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Tax

[[Sanctions]{.mark} will [slow Iran's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Travel bans will limit]{.mark} the
**spread of [COVID]{.mark}-19**]{.underline}. These [[claims all posit a
**causal relationship**]{.mark} between **means** and
**ends**]{.underline}. Regardless of party, ideology, or motive, no
policymaker wants ~~his or her~~ \[their\] recommended course of action
to produce unanticipated consequences. This makes [[every policymaker a
**forecaster**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [But forecasting is
difficult]{.underline}, [[particularly when it comes to
**geopolitics**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a domain in which the rules of
the game are poorly understood, information is invariably incomplete,
and expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting
future events.

These challenges present practical problems for decision-makers in the
U.S. government. On the one hand, the limits of imagination create blind
spots that policymakers tend to fill in with past experience. They often
assume that tomorrow's dangers will look like yesterday's, retaining the
same mental map even as the territory around them changes dramatically.
On the other hand, if policymakers addressed all imaginable threats, the
United States would need so large and expensive a national security
establishment that the country could do little else. By many measures,
it is nearing this point already. The United States has military bases
in more than 70 countries and territories, boasts more than four million
federal employees with security clearances, and fields 1.3 million
active-duty troops, with another million in reserve. According to one
estimate, the United States spends \$1.25 trillion annually on national
security. When it comes to anticipating the future, then, the United
States is getting the worst of both worlds. It spends untold sums of
money preparing yet still finds itself the victim of surprise ---
fundamentally ill equipped for defining events, such as the emergence of
COVID-19.

There is a [[better way]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that would [allow the
United States [to make decisions based not on **simplistic
extrapolations**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the past [[but]{.mark} on
**smart [estimates]{.mark}** [of the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} reconciling two approaches often seen to
be at philosophical loggerheads: [[**scenario planning** and
**probabilistic forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each approach has a
fundamentally different assumption about the future. Scenario planners
maintain that there are so many possible futures that one can imagine
them only in terms of plausibility, not probability. By contrast,
forecasters believe it is possible to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes, thereby transforming amorphous uncertainty into quantifiable
risk. Because each method has its strengths, the [optimal
approach]{.underline} is [to **combine them**]{.underline}. This
**[[holistic method]{.underline}]{.mark}** would [[provide policymakers
with]{.underline}]{.mark} both a [[range of **conceivable futures**
and]{.mark} regular updates as to [which]{.mark}]{.underline} one [[is
likely to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. For once, they could
[make]{.underline} shrewd [bets about tomorrow]{.underline},
[today]{.underline}.

PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTY

Although widely used in business today, the first element of this duo
--- [[scenario planning]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grew out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} post--World War II national security concerns,
specifically the [**overwhelming [uncertainty]{.mark}** of the nuclear
revolution]{.underline}. Previously, martial experience was thought to
offer some guidance through the fog of war. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, however, [presented a novel problem]{.underline}.
With the newfound ability to destroy each other as functioning societies
in a matter of minutes or hours, the United States and the Soviet Union
[faced an **unprecedented situation**]{.underline}. And unprecedented
situations are, by definition, uncertain. They lack any analogy to the
past that would allow decision-makers to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes.

Still, early U.S. efforts at nuclear-war planning sought to turn that
problem into a calculable one. During World War II, the Allies had great
success with the new field of operations research, the application of
statistical methods to improve the outcome of tactical engagements.
After the war, the RAND Corporation --- a "think factory" that the U.S.
Air Force established as a repository for leading researchers --- hoped
to parlay this success into a new, more rational approach to war, based
less on the intuition of generals and more on the quantification
afforded by models and data.

Unfortunately, methods that worked at the tactical level proved nearly
farcical at the strategic level. As the historian David Jardini has
chronicled, RAND's first attempt to model a nuclear strategy ignored so
many key variables that it nonsensically called for deploying a fleet of
aging turboprop bombers that carried no bombs because the United States
did not have enough fissile material to arm them; the goal was simply to
overwhelm Soviet air defenses, with no regard for the lives of the
pilots. In the wake of such failures, it became clear that [[analysts
could not]{.mark} **entirely [banish]{.mark}**
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1960, even Charles Hitch, a man
predisposed to calculation by dint of being RAND's top economist and
president of what was then the Operations Research Society of America,
cautioned, "[No other characteristic of decision-making is as
**pervasive** as uncertainty]{.underline}."

That, of course, [[raised]{.mark} the [question of how to formulate
**sensible strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unexpectedly, it was a RAND
mathematician and physicist, Herman Kahn, who offered an answer. If the
lived past could not shape strategy, perhaps [[the **imagined
future**]{.mark} could]{.underline}. Frustrated with RAND's attempts to
scientize war, Kahn devoted himself to [[crafting
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} in the pursuit of "ersatz experience"
that would [[prepare the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [for the
future through]{.mark}]{.underline} what were essentially [[thought
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[scenarios
as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[artificial]{.underline}]{.mark} '[case
histories]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} '[historical
[anecdotes]{.mark}]{.underline},'" Kahn wrote, thus [[making up
for]{.mark} a [lack of **actual examples** or]{.mark} **meaningful
[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They would [provide analogies where there
were none]{.underline}.

Early methods of generating scenarios were often freewheeling and
discursive. But after scenario planning migrated to the business world,
it took on more structured forms. The most recognizable is a two-by-two
matrix in which planners identify two critical uncertainties and, taking
the extreme values of each, construct four possible future worlds.
Regardless of the specific shape they take, [**[rigorous
scenario-planning]{.mark}** exercises]{.underline} all involve
[[identifying key **uncertainties** and]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[imagining]{.mark} how [different combinations]{.mark}]{.underline}
could [[yield situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[vastly
different from]{.underline}]{.mark} what [**[mere
extrapolation]{.mark}** of the present]{.underline} would suggest. By
then "backcasting" --- taking one of these imagined futures as a given
and asking what conditions produced it --- [scenario planners
[derive]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[a **story** and a
**system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They come up with a plausible narrative
of how a future happened and an internal logic that describes how it
operates. [[Scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} are not supposed to be
predictive. They are meant to be provocative, [[challenging]{.mark}
**planners' [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[shaking]{.underline}]{.mark} up their [**mental [models]{.mark}** [of
how the world works]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[giving
them]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cognitive flexibility to better
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[shape]{.mark}, [and adapt to the]{.mark}
**emerging [future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The pandemic has occasioned a renaissance in the use of scenarios, as
organizations from think tanks to technology companies grapple with the
question of what a "new normal" might look like and how soon it might
arrive. But the national security community has long used scenarios to
address some of its most wicked problems --- particularly high-stakes
issues that are in flux, such as the U.S.-Chinese relationship. This
past summer, RAND released a report on Chinese grand strategy. It
concluded with four scenarios that offered brief vignettes of China's
possible place in the world 30 years from now. "Triumphant China"
dominates the world stage in most domains, with a modern military and an
innovative economy. "Ascendant China" is the preeminent power not only
in Asia but in other regions, as well. "Stagnant China" has suffered
from low growth and faces social unrest. And "Imploding China"
experiences a crisis of existential proportions, in which domestic
instability undercuts the country's international influence.

Although comprehensive, the wide range of these scenarios highlights the
chief challenge of the method: If China's potential futures encompass
rise, fall, and everything in between, how can they aid in the
formulation of strategy and policy? Although this cornucopia of
scenarios could lead policymakers to develop strategies that would
improve the United States' position no matter which future comes to
pass, in practice, having too many different versions of the future can
make it nearly impossible to act. [**Good [scenario planning]{.mark}**
[puts boundaries on the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, but those limits
are often not enough [[for **decision-makers** to work
with]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} need to [[know
which future is **most likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[TURNING **UNCERTAINTY** INTO **RISK**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the second element
of the duo --- tries to [[address]{.mark} that
**[shortcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forecasters see scenario
planning as]{.underline} maddeningly vague or, worse, [dangerously
misleading]{.underline}. They not only point to the lack of consistent
evidence to support the alleged benefits of scenario planning; they also
argue that the compelling nature of a good story can trigger a host of
biases. Such biases fuel irrationality, in part by tricking
decision-makers into making basic statistical errors. For example, even
though a detailed narrative may seem more plausible than a sparse one,
every contingent event decreases the likelihood that a given scenario
will actually transpire. Nevertheless, people frequently confuse
plausibility for probability, assigning greater likelihood to specific
stories that have the ring of truth. They might, illogically, consider a
war with China triggered by a clash in the Taiwan Strait more likely
than a war with China triggered by any possible cause.

In contrast to scenario planning's emphasis on imagination, forecasting
tends to rely on calculation. Deductive approaches use models or laws
that describe the behavior of a system to predict its future state, much
like Newtonian mechanics allows astronomers to anticipate the position
of the planets. Inductive approaches do not require such understanding,
merely enough data and the assumption that the future will in some way
reflect the past. This is how Netflix anticipates what you might like to
watch or Amazon what you might want to buy, based purely on your
previous actions. Increasingly, thanks to advances in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, analysts use hybrid approaches.
Meteorology is a good example, in which researchers combine
sophisticated models and big data collection, which feed into each other
and enable ever-better weather forecasts.

International politics poses a challenge for these methods because the
laws governing the system are elusive or highly debatable, relevant data
points are often unavailable or unprecedented, and thousands of
variables interact in countless ways. History functions as a series of
unfolding events, with highly contingent branching paths sometimes
separated by mere happenstance. Tectonic shifts can hinge on seemingly
mundane occurrences. That makes it hard to deduce future events from
theoretical principles or to induce them from past experience.

As a result, historians and foreign policy experts are often bad
forecasters. In 2005, one of us, Philip Tetlock, published a study
demonstrating that seasoned political experts had trouble outperforming
"dart-tossing chimpanzees" --- random guesses --- when it came to
predicting global events. The experts fared even worse against amateur
news junkies. Overconfidence was the norm, not the exception. When
experts expressed 100 percent certainty that events would occur, those
events materialized only 80 percent of the time. Yet there were pockets
of excellence amid this unimpressive performance. Those who were surest
that they understood the forces driving the political system
("hedgehogs," in the philosopher Isaiah Berlin's terminology) fared
significantly worse than their humbler colleagues, who did not shy from
complexity, approaching problems with greater curiosity and
open-mindedness ("foxes").

This distinction caught the eye of the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity, which set up a geopolitical "forecasting tournament,"
in which Tetlock participated. He recruited a team of volunteers to
provide probabilistic answers to sharply defined questions, such as
"Will the euro fall below \$1.20 in the next year?" or "Will the
president of Tunisia flee to exile in the next six months?" By measuring
the difference between estimates and the actual occurrence of events,
Tetlock and his colleagues could calculate a score showing how
"well-calibrated" the expectations of any given forecaster were with
reality. By analyzing these data, Tetlock discovered that the [[key to
more accurate **geopolitical forecasting** was]{.mark} to take
people]{.underline} who were [naturally **numerate** and
**open-minded**]{.underline}, [train them [to think
**probabilistically**]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid common biases, and
then group them so they could leverage the "wisdom of the crowd." The
**[[best forecasters]{.underline}]{.mark}** would
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly intractable [[questions by
decomposing them]{.underline}]{.mark} into parts, researching the past
frequency of similar (if not precisely analogous) events, adjusting the
odds based the uniqueness of the situation, and continually updating
their estimates as new information emerged. By the end of the
tournament, Tetlock's top performers had achieved scores that were 30
percent better than those of career CIA analysts with access to
classified information. Somehow, they had [[transmuted **uncertainty**
into **measurable risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The advantages of being able to put realistic odds on possible futures
are obvious. It gives you a peek into the future. But even the best
forecasters have their limits. If asked to predict events three to five
years out, their performance becomes increasingly indistinguishable from
random guessing. Still, many [[**critical policy questions** are **short
term**]{.underline}]{.mark}: perhaps the most famous recent example
concerned whether Osama bin Laden was in the Abbottabad compound in May
2011. Highly consequential short-term questions now include when a
COVID-19 vaccine will be widely available. As of this writing, the smart
money (68 percent probability) is on or before March 31, 2021.

But to the extent that leaders need to make consequential,
difficult-to-reverse decisions that will play out over the long run ---
the strategic choices that will give the United States an advantage over
time --- it becomes more difficult to link forecasts to policymaking.
Well-calibrated forecasters, for instance, can estimate the likelihood
that a skirmish with the Chinese navy in the South China Sea will result
in at least two American deaths by December 31. But what policymakers
really want to know is the extent to which China will threaten U.S.
interests in the coming years and decades.

Answers to that type of inquiry are beyond the reach of forecasters
because it is impossible to define precisely what constitutes an
interest or a threat. To provide forecasts, questions must pass the
"clairvoyance test," which is to say that were it possible to pose the
question to a genuine clairvoyant, that omniscient seer must be able to
answer it without having to ask for clarification. "Will I fall in
love?" is not a forecasting question. "Will I marry Jane Smith by this
time next year?" is.

From a policy perspective, then, the greatest challenge to forecasts is
that although they can clarify slices of the future, they do not
necessarily provide enough information to inform decision-making.
Indeed, making a decision based on one specific forecast would be a
mistake: the estimated probability of an event is a poor proxy for the
significance of that event. "Will Vladimir Putin relinquish power within
the next two years?" is a far different question from "What would
Vladimir Putin's abdication of power mean for U.S.-Russian relations?"
The problem with forecasting is thus the exact opposite of the problem
with scenarios: if the latter often provide too panoramic a view of the
future to be useful, the former provides too narrow a glimpse.

AN ANSWER FOR THE FUTURE

How should these different approaches to anticipating the future be
linked? The answer lies in developing clusters of questions that give
early, forecastable indications of which envisioned future is likely to
emerge, thus allowing policymakers to place smarter bets sooner. Instead
of evaluating the likelihood of a long-term scenario as a whole,
question clusters allow analysts to break down potential futures into a
series of clear and forecastable signposts that are observable in the
short run. Questions should be chosen not only for their individual
diagnostic value but also for their diversity as a set, so that each
cluster provides the greatest amount of information about which imagined
future is emerging --- or which elements of which envisioned futures are
emerging. As a result, the seductiveness of a particular narrative will
not tempt decision-makers into mistaking plausibility for probability.
Instead, preliminary answers to specific questions can provide a simple
metric for judging in advance how the future is most likely to unfold
--- a metric that analysts can then refine once the event in question
takes place or not.

Consider the scenarios RAND produced as part of its analysis of China's
grand strategy. The four scenarios envisioned for 2050 --- "Triumphant
China," "Ascendant China," "Stagnant China," and "Imploding China" ---
can be roughly placed on a classic two-by-two matrix, with the strength
of China's political leadership on one axis and the strength of China's
economy on the other. A cluster of questions that would give a heads-up
that history is on a "Triumphant China" trajectory might include "On
December 31, 2020, will China exercise de facto control over Itu Aba (or
Taiping Island) in the South China Sea (which is currently under the de
facto control of Taiwan)?" "Will China's GDP growth in 2023 exceed ten
percent?" and "Among African audiences, when will the China Global
Television Network have a higher weekly viewership than Voice of
America?"

These questions are useful both individually and collectively. Knowing
that top forecasters see an increased chance of China controlling the
island (from, say, a ten percent probability to a 20 percent
probability), for instance, would provide immediate tactical value to
the U.S. Navy. It should not necessarily tip the balance in the debate
over whether China will be "triumphant," but if all the forecasts
resulting from the question cluster are trending in the same direction,
the United States may want to recalibrate its strategy. As forecasts
change and individual questions are answered by the course of events,
the view of the far-off future becomes a little bit clearer. Analysts
can then update their scenarios and generate new clusters of questions.
They can thus develop a continually evolving sense of plausible futures,
as well as a probabilistic estimate of which policies will yield the
most bang for the buck today.

This method resembles the U.S. defense and intelligence community's use
of indications and warnings. In the early 1960s, for example, the
National Intelligence Council developed a list of actions --- large
troop maneuvers, for instance --- that might precede an attack by the
Sino-Soviet bloc. The idea was that tactical changes might provide an
early warning of future strategic shifts. Indications and warnings have
come to play an important role in many national security scenarios.
Unfortunately, there are potential problems with scouring today's
environment for hints of tomorrow. For one thing, as psychological
research shows, having envisioned a particular scenario, humans are not
only inclined to consider it more likely; they are also more prone to
see evidence of its emergence---a form of confirmation bias that U.S.
intelligence has battled for decades. For another, analysts are not
particularly good at discerning in real time which events matter---which
signposts are actually indicative of a particular future. Developments
initially considered to be earthshattering may turn out to be
significantly less important, whereas a story buried well beneath the
day's headlines can end up changing the course of history. In a
statistical analysis of nearly two million State Department cables sent
in the 1970s, for instance, one recent study demonstrated that U.S.
diplomats were often bad at estimating the historical importance of
contemporaneous events.

[[Linking scenarios to]{.underline}]{.mark} clusters of [forecasting
[questions mitigates]{.mark} these [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, because the questions must be precise enough to pass the
clairvoyance test, there is no wiggle room about what constitutes, say,
large troop maneuvers. Second, because questions that disprove
hypotheses often yield the greatest information, selecting questions for
their diagnostic value [[decreases]{.mark} forecasters' susceptibility
to **[confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, much as
diversified stock portfolios spread risk through multiple, uncorrelated
investments, the diversity of question clusters
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} forecasters from [[overweighting]{.mark}
a [potentially **unimportant signpost** and **mistakenly
concluding**]{.mark}]{.underline} that a [particular scenario is coming
to pass]{.underline}. Finally, and most important, because [[question
clusters yield]{.mark} forecasts]{.underline}, [one can attach
[**meaningful probabilities** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[likelihood]{.mark} that [**particular events** will occur]{.mark} in
the future]{.underline}. This [provides]{.underline} a sort of advance
[**e**arly **w**arning **s**ystem]{.underline}. An event does not need
to actually transpire for the United States to have actionable
information. That, more than anything else, gives question clusters an
advantage over traditional indications and warnings.

PLANNING IN PRACTICE

To be useful, any vision of the future must be connected to decisions in
the present. Scholars and practitioners often claim that [[scenario
planning and probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} are
incompatible given their different assumptions and goals. In fact, they
[[mesh]{.mark} well]{.underline}. A scenario planner's conviction that
the future is uncertain need not clash with a forecaster's quest to
translate uncertainty into risk. Rather, the challenge lies in
understanding the limits of each method. Question clusters [make it
possible [to leverage]{.mark} the [strength of **each
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[transforming]{.mark} the [**abstract
long term** into]{.mark} the [**concrete short term**
so]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[understand the future **quickly** and act to **stave off
danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}, seize opportunity, and strengthen
national security.

The [[greatest barrier]{.mark} to]{.underline} a [**clearer vision** of
the future [is not **philosophical** but
**organizational**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [[potential]{.mark} of
combining scenario planning with probabilistic forecasting [means
**nothing** if it is not **implemented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
occasion, the intelligence community has used forecasting tournaments to
inform its estimates, but that is only a first step.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and consumers of intelligence are
the ones who [[must]{.mark} understand]{.underline} the [importance of
forecasts and [**incorporate them** into]{.mark} their
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Too often, operational demands --- the
daily business of organizations, from weighty decisions to the mundane
--- fix attention on the current moment.

[[Overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tyranny of the present
requires]{.mark} **high-level action** and broad]{.underline},
[[sustained effort]{.underline}]{.mark}. Leaders across the U.S.
government must cultivate the cognitive habits of top forecasters
throughout their organizations, while also institutionalizing the
imaginative processes of scenario planners. The country's prosperity,
its [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, [ultimately]{.underline}, its
power all [[depend on policymakers' ability to envision **long-term
futures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[anticipate **short-term
developments**]{.underline}, [and use]{.underline}]{.mark} [both
[**projections** to inform everything]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
budget to grand strategy. Giving the future short shrift only
shortchanges the United States.

that strategy and the investments it requires]{.underline}. [The state
of American opinion]{.underline} on that subject [is]{.underline}
currently [ambiguous]{.underline}. [Polling]{.underline} data [indicates
that **public support**]{.underline} for most key aspects of American
internationalism [**has recovered** somewhat]{.underline} from where it
was in 2012--13, [and is again]{.underline} at or [near postwar
average]{.underline}s.[^[32]{.underline}^](javascript:void(0)) [But [the
**2016 election**]{.mark}]{.underline} cycle [and its]{.underline}
eventual [outcome **[revealed]{.mark}** strong [**support** for
candidates]{.mark}]{.underline} who advocated [**[rolling back]{.mark}**
key elements of post--Cold War]{.underline} (and post--World War II)
**[[grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[from]{.underline} [**free
trade** to]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S.
**[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This atmosphere [[reflects
**discontent** with the **failures**]{.mark} and **frustrations**
[of]{.mark} U.S. **grand [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
post--Cold War era, no doubt, yet it also [reflects the fact that
**American [strategy]{.mark}** seems **[at risk of]{.mark} becoming [a
victim of its]{.mark}** own
**[success]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[^[33]{.underline}^](javascript:void(0)) By
helping to foster a comparatively stable and congenial environment,
American [policies have made it more difficult for Americans to
**remember why** significant **[investments]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the global order [**[are needed]{.mark}** in the first
place]{.underline}.

Today, [[this]{.mark} ambivalence is becoming]{.underline} increasingly
[problematic]{.underline}, for the simple reason that properly
[resourcing American **strategy** [**requires** **making**]{.mark}
politically **[difficult trade-offs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[with]{.mark} respect to [**entitlements** **and** other
**ballooning**]{.mark} domestic **[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
also becoming problematic, of course, because [even if the American
public seems to support particular aspects of American grand strategy,
[the **public has shown** itself **willing to elect a president**
who]{.mark} appears to **[care little]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the
successful postwar and post--Cold War tradition, [even if he
has]{.underline}, so far, [maintained more aspects]{.underline} of that
tradition [as president than his campaign rhetoric might have led one to
expect]{.underline}. [In the future]{.underline}---and indeed, looking
beyond Trump's presidency---[**[sustaining]{.mark}** American **grand
[strategy]{.mark}** [will]{.mark}]{.underline} thus
[**[require]{.mark}** [more]{.mark} **intensive [political
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

American [[leaders]{.mark} will [need to]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[effectively [make the case for]{.mark} [**controversial** but]{.mark}
broadly **[beneficial policies]{.mark}** such as free trade,
while]{.underline} also [addressing the inevitable]{.underline}
socioeconomic [dislocations such policies
cause.[^34^](javascript:void(0))]{.underline} [They will need
to]{.underline} more [fully [**articulate** the]{.mark} **underlying
[logic]{.mark} and value** [of **alliances** and]{.mark} other
**[commitments]{.mark}** whose costs]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
often [more visible]{.underline}---not to say greater---[than their
benefits]{.underline}. They will need to remind Americans that
[[their]{.mark} country's **[leadership]{.mark}** has not been a matter
of charity]{.underline}; [it [has]{.mark} helped [**produce** an]{.mark}
**international [order]{.mark}** that is [**exceptional** in]{.mark} its
**stability, [liberalism]{.mark}, and benefits**]{.underline} for the
United States. Not least, they will need to make the case that [the
costs that the country has borne in support of that order are designed
to avoid the necessity of bearing]{.underline} vastly [higher costs if
the international scene returned to a more tumultuous
state]{.underline}. After all, [[the **success of** American
**statecraft**]{.mark} is]{.underline} often [reflected in the **bad
things that don't happen** as well as in the **good things that
do**]{.underline}. [Making this point [is essential

#### Researching and debating IR is good. 

**Ettinger, 20**---Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science,
Carleton University (Aaron, "Scattered and Unsystematic: The Taught
Discipline in the Intellectual Life of International Relations,"
International Studies Perspectives (2020) 0, 1--24, dml)

[The first benefit is]{.underline} generating [a **well-trained
[pipeline]{.mark}** [of future IR scholars]{.mark} and practitioners.
Today's students are the **scholars** and **practitioners of tomorrow**,
and sparking **curiosity** in students, [especially
**undergraduates**]{.mark}, has the potential to [**rejuvenate the
field** from within]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Hagmann and Biersteker
(2014, 292--293) argue, [IR scholars should "take a **more direct
interest** in]{.underline} how world politics is explained to [students
in everyday schooling practices]{.underline}." This is eminently
sensible. International relations' [preoccupation with]{.underline} "the
cult of research intensivity" (Nossal 2006, 737), and to a lesser extent
[political practice]{.underline}, [**[misleads]{.mark}** the
[professoriate into believing]{.mark} that the very people who sustain
universities as institutions and who are the future of the
discipline---[student]{.mark} subscribers---[can be
**ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has]{.underline} also [led the IR
professoriate [to **undervalue**]{.mark}]{.underline} the contribution
that the taught discipline makes to disciplinary renewal through [the
[**training** of]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [next generation]{.underline}.

[For future practitioners, whether in **government** or **elsewhere**,
an [IR education provides]{.mark} the [**conceptual architecture**
needed to **make decisions**]{.mark} about policy and its place in the
world]{.underline}. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger emphasizes this
point: "The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high
office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they
continue in office. There is little time for leaders to reflect" (as
quoted in Desch 2019, 153). While Kissinger is talking about the highest
level of elected office, it is equally true that [policymakers
throughout government come in equipped with the **intellectual capital**
and **technical skills** learned in the classroom]{.underline} (Biswas
and Paczynska 2015). [For future scholars, early lessons have
**downstream effects** on the very content of IR knowledge]{.underline}.
After all, [the [**classroom** is where IR theory gets reproduced "**for
the first time**" to]{.mark} future generations of IR
[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Newsom (1995, 64--65) put
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark}, "\[t\]eachers [**[plant the seeds]{.mark}**
that shape the thinking of each new generation; this is]{.underline}
probably [the academic world's **most lasting
contribution**]{.underline}." [It is also a place where the durability
and centrality of the field's major theories are reinforced as a matter
of course and **not necessarily for the better**]{.underline} (Vitalis
2015, 6). [Early undergraduates **carry** the assumptions they are
taught **throughout** their undergraduate and graduate careers, and
**beyond**. A discipline that **cannot connect** with students or is
inward-looking and esoteric risks **putting off** its next
generation]{.underline}. Thus, [the classroom needs to be treated with
**greater regard** as a site of **knowledge production** and
**dissemination** in the intellectual life of the field]{.underline}. In
this sense, [curiosity can be provoked among students that may continue
**beyond** an undergraduate career]{.underline}. Take, for example, the
observation of one student on her intellectual awakening in the
classroom:

Despite a Eurocentric and male-dominated ethos, what ultimately
convinced me to stay in IR was my exposure and inability to detach from
what was first described to me as the politics of the "postcolonial." A
lecturer holding up a roughened paperback copy of Edward Said's 1979
acclaimed work Orientalism originally introduced me to
postcolonialism...Hearing Said's words being reiterated back to me in my
predominately white and conservative-leaning lecture theater was a
defining moment in my education. Orientalism provided an experience that
I could finally connect with: one where political power was not about
who had the most weaponry or democracy, but instead about who held
political control over the reality of the racialized person (Abu-Bakare
2017).

The moment captured in this tableau is the [[intellectual
awakening]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is possible]{.mark}
when]{.underline} pedagogy is carefully considered. From [the
student]{.underline} perspective, well-taught courses
**[prepare]{.underline}** them better [for the next stage in their
education, [starting with **superior**]{.mark} **foundational
[training]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the early undergraduate levels [and
[progressing to **improved research**]{.mark} **capabilities**
[and]{.mark} **substantive [knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
higher undergraduate levels, and then to advanced skills training in
graduate school. [Well-trained cohorts]{.underline} coming up the ranks
[will be **highly proficient** in a **wider range** of IR topics,
theories, ideas, and methods and will be **well prepared** to make the
jump to fluency]{.underline}. Similarly, [future practitioners will be
equipped with **superior substantive** and **technical
training**]{.underline}. This is especially true with "experiential
learning." Done in purposeful ways, learning through experiences outside
the classroom generates employable skills for students.

Social and Institutional Context of Teaching and Disciplinary
Reproduction

Directly related to the question of the future of international
relations is the social context of teaching and the discipline's
reproduction in the classroom. IR [scholars must recognize that the [IR
classroom is the site of]{.mark} **ideational [preferences]{.mark}**,
clashes of **favored** or **disfavored paradigms**, of **personal
authority**]{.underline}, generational difference, [**social
privileges**, and **prejudices**. At **every point** in]{.underline}
professional [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [there
are implications for how knowledge is **produced**, **taught**, and
**passed on**]{.underline} (Ettinger 2016; Colgan 2017; Fattore 2018;
Knight 2019). Indeed, [the intellectual output of IR scholars does not
exist independent of the **lived context** in which it is
produced]{.underline}. Gaining insight into the social context of
international relations' taught discipline can help begin to correct the
pathologies that are affecting the way the next generation of IR
scholars are being taught right now and how future scholars and
practitioners will be taught next year and beyond.

It begins by addressing the social identity of the instructor and how it
contributes to the reproduction of IR knowledge. After all, the
instructor does not speak from a position of nowhere and an account of
IR pedagogy should address the personal features of the instructor, her
place within the discipline's division of labor, and its effect on the
delivery of course content (Biswas and Deylami 2017). For international
relations especially, it is the site of entrenched male and
Euro-Atlantic dominance with cascading implications within the classroom
and beyond. The 2014 TRIP survey shows that the global IR professorate
is two-thirds male (Maliniak et al. 2014). In the United States and
British IR "core" and in the Anglo "noncore" (Cox and Nossal 2009), the
professoriate is overwhelmingly white and male. Australia is 72.11
percent male and 76.87 percent white. Canada is 70.83 percent male and
83.4 percent white. The United Kingdom is 64.83 percent male and 85.23
percent white, while the United States is 68.33 percent male and 85.21
percent white non-Hispanic. New Zealand, a slight outlier, is 81.82
percent male but only 34.78 percent identifying as NZ European (Maliniak
et al. 2014). Given what has been shown about the American dominance of
the discipline, the insularity of national IR communities, and the
gender gap in citations, it is reasonable to conclude that the bulk of
the most influential IR scholarship is produced and disseminated by
white men in the West (Maliniak et al. 2018; Maliniak et al 2013).

Understanding this relationship can improve IR pedagogy by recognizing
how diverse student populations interact with an overwhelmingly white
Euro-Atlantic intellectual tradition and by remedying some of the
attending limitations such as geohistorical narrowness, state-centrism,
epistemological positivism, and phallocentric authorship (Fonseca 2019).
In this regard, the taught discipline of international relations should
be intellectually responsive to a diversifying discipline and to a
diversifying student population. Such circumstances call for a broader
approach to teaching courses in a field whose heavy Euro-American
centrality can alienate students when their backgrounds are not
reflected in the course material. This is not simply a matter of
curriculum design that tries to mirror or "look like" the students
(Appiah 2019, SR7). Rather, it is one that balances disciplinary
foundations with broadened ontological scope of what "matters" in IR in
order to generate betterinformed teaching. It is widely recognized that
international relations is a very traditional field of scholarship, but
this should not preclude perspectives beyond the canon or case studies
from outside the empirical mainstream. More ambitious and, especially,
diverse content helps adapt teaching to changing student audiences. This
is especially true at the undergraduate level. What is important to
avoid is the "pipeline problem" that has discouraged women and
minorities from progressing through the scholarly ranks in STEM fields
(Brown et al. 2016; Branch 2016). By the same token, bringing more and
more diverse young students into the discipline of international
relations and encouraging their growth can bear intellectual fruit down
the line. At very least, we avoid artificially restricting the
development of the next generation of scholars.

[By **no means** is this a call to **jettison** the
classics]{.underline}. To the contrary, [[the field's canon is
**irreplaceable**]{.mark} as a foundation, as the **intellectual
inheritance** of the present, [as the **prevailing ideas** of]{.mark}
foreign [policymakers, and]{.mark} as **[points of
disagreement]{.mark}** for critical traditions]{.underline}. However,
[the scope of [IR]{.mark} pedagogy can [be
**expanded**]{.mark}]{.underline} to make it relevant for a twenty-first
century classroom. Primarily, this means expanding the theoretical and
empirical scope of international relations [[**beyond** its]{.mark}
traditional **Eurocentric** and **male-dominated**
[parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Acharya 2016). This is
discussed below. Granted, there will be no singular population to which
an IR curriculum will be pitched. Variation in student population
profiles based on race, gender, class, geography, and other identity
markers complicate the decisions that an instructor has to make. The
point is that there are intellectual gains to be had when the taught
discipline takes seriously the social context of international
relations' disciplinary reproduction. With a more diverse pedagogy in
place, it is possible that, with more eyes on the subject matter and
more minds from different backgrounds at work, [the IR classroom can
generate greater interest in **fundamental theoretical questions** for
the next generation of scholars to solve]{.underline}.

Institutional context of teaching matters too. The vast majority of IR
practice takes place in university institutions. Therefore, the material
institutional setting must enter in as a condition of international
relations' intellectual life. Consider first, the matter of basic
institutional survival. In an era where public universities around the
world face funding problems, there are immediate economic imperatives
for taking the taught discipline of international relations seriously.
In the short term, survival in unforgiving economic times requires
student enrollment and retention (Conley 2019). Systematic accounts of
US undergraduate enrollment since the Great Recession of 2008 show
majors in the "traditional disciplines" declining by 21 percent
(philosophy) to 30 percent (history). Political science and
international relations fare less badly, declining "only" by 11 percent
and 15 percent over ten years (Schmidt 2018). Put differently, the
classroom is on the front line in the battle for resources. Student
recruitment and retention are essential to the economic viability of
academic departments including political science and international
relations. Turning students off the subject matter through an
unreflexive pedagogy, boring classes, or mediocre lecturers has real
economic implications for the future. Without students prepared to part
with tuition dollars, or governments prepared to unlock activity-based
funding, no department can thrive, even with a roster of productive
researchers. Concretely, this means no new hiring and reduced budgets---
a recipe for contraction. In this context, the systematic neglect of the
classroom by IR stocktakers is entirely inexplicable given the parlous
financial state of most public universities. Trends in expanded
enrollment compound or create new problems. Universities that pack
classrooms with hundreds, if not thousands, of more students---many of
whom are international and pay exorbitant tuition fees---put revenue
generation above pedagogy (Schulmann 2019).

The disciplinary division of university labor must be factored into an
understanding of the context of IR teaching and its implications for the
intellectual life of international relations. In this sense, debate
about the taught discipline must grapple with question of resources,
division of university labor, teaching assignments, pressures of the
tenure track, the precarity of contract faculty, and other aspects of
university governance as conditions that influence the classroom. One of
the most striking trends in university governance is the increasing role
of contingent instructors. In the United States, some 73 percent of
instructional positions were nontenure track in 2016 (AAUP 2018). This
is consistent with longer-term trends. The percentage of postsecondary
instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6
percent in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. In that time, the number of
full-time tenure-track positions increased by 10 percent while the
number of full- or part-time contingent positions doubled (GAO 2017,
8--9). This is not to say that contingent faculty are worse teachers,
but the contingent nature of the work creates impediments to teaching.
Fewer institutional resources, the constant need to reapply for jobs,
and the need for part-time work outside the university are all matters
that detract from time dedicated to students, improving pedagogy, or
learning new content. Downstream, the design of an IR class or the
delivery of an IR curriculum may not be nearly as effective as it could
be.

Intellectual Reflection and Renewal from the Inside Out

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **[new]{.mark}
avenues of [research]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The
classroom is a **much more permissive intellectual environment** than
academic publishing. It affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of
freedom to **explore topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of
their research expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond
one's comfort zone [permits **thinking**]{.mark} **out loud**,
[**working through ideas**, and **entanglement in**]{.mark} **analytical
[puzzles]{.mark}**. Doing so is demanding, and it is much easier to fall
back on existing]{.underline} teaching [content. But an
ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can lead to **new research
questions**, **new** and **unexpected intellectual horizons**, and
**better background context** for existing expertise]{.underline}.
Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that there is no better way to
learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [[it is up to]{.mark} the community of [scholars to
**debate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may well be that the enormous
variation in the purpose of teaching international relations and the
radical decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught
discipline. [Though [IR teaching]{.mark} may be **wildly
divergent**]{.underline} around the world, [there [is]{.mark} **always
some purpose** to it, and]{.underline}, however defined, [this is an
**intrinsic feature** of an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128)
famous admonition that "[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or [a]{.mark}n **analytical [template]{.mark}** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it helps [to **frame thematic**
and **empirical**]{.mark} **cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so
that course material is not merely a reflection the professor's
unexamined preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to
articulate. Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic
conferences, and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should [**embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit]{.mark}, and criticism]{.underline}. A great
deal has been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and
McCourt 2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far
different from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences
accrue over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope
of possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually
permissive**. Teaching international relations can be **theoretically**
and **empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon,
its inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary
alternatives (Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative
pluralism" (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity
as a means of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional
accounts** of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the
world that includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic
theater, that has dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR
thinking]{.underline} (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

Pedagogical pluralism in international relations flows from intuitions
about balancing theory and empirics, the canon and its alternatives,
being current while eschewing presentism, being "useful" without being
instrumentalist, and drawing on instructor expertise without being
constrained by the hyperspecialized knowledge attendant to the published
discipline. Of course, this is easy to say. But operationalizing these
intuitions into a pluralistic teaching program is much more difficult.
Complicating the matter is the relative absence of explicit theoretical
guidance for making IR pluralism work in the classroom. The insights of
proponents of a "Global IR" can help, including some critiqued above for
their neglect of the classroom. In particular, Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 300--308) program for developing a Global IR provides concrete
steps toward curriculum design as much as is does for research.

Regarding the IR theoretical parts of their program, Acharya and Buzan
(2019, 301) say that Global IR respects existing theories while "giving
due recognition to the places, roles, and contributions of non-Western
peoples and societies," which entails "pluralization within theories,
rather than just between them." There are issues here. First,
[[pluralization between theories requires **expanding**]{.mark} **the
remit** of [IR]{.mark} theory beyond the grand IR paradigms [to include
**non-Western contributions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to international
thought (Acharya and Buzan 2010; Acharya 2011). [But this is not
easy]{.underline}. Tickner and Wæver (2009) make it clear that
[Anglo-American IR looms impossibly large around the world. Without
jettisoning this intellectual inheritance]{.underline}, Thinking
International Relations Differently (Tickner and Blaney 2012) provides a
route to [pluralism]{.underline}. That volume [**interrogates
alternative meanings** to some of i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [central
concepts]{.underline}---security, state, sovereignty and authority,
globalization, secularism, religion, and the international. A professor
committed to [this kind of [pluralism]{.mark} can **[expand]{.mark} the
conceptual [vocabulary]{.mark}** of international relations in a way
that **encourages**]{.underline} undergraduate [**conversancy** in
multiple IR vernaculars **within** and **beyond** the Anglo-American
core]{.underline}.

[There is also the matter of what do with the **existing**,
**Western-centric canon**]{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan (2019, 301)
also say that [a global international relations would **subsume** rather
than **supplant** existing IR theories and methods. The purpose here is
**not to displace** Western-dominated IR knowledge but to **situate** it
within the global context]{.underline}. This is an entirely attainable
objective for an IR theory instructor. IR teachers should have full
command of some IR theories while being conversant in nearly all anyway.
[Integrating a fuller slate of intellectual content into teaching IR
theory permits]{.underline} a **[cognitive pluralism]{.underline}** that
is rarely available in the published discipline. The point here is that
teaching narrowly and to the expertise of professors may suit their
interests, but it puts blinders on the students. Upper-year and graduate
studies can explore specific pathways, but only after international
relations' map has been presented. This likely means instructors must
venture out of their preferred intellectual comfort zones and teach to
their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Doing so, however, requires
breaking through disciplinary walls and should not be underestimated. It
requires breadth of knowledge, disciplinary literacy beyond the
scholar's training, and language skills (usually beyond English) that
can take many years to develop, while the imperatives of the published
discipline stress specialization.

Regarding the empirical subject matter, a pluralistic IR agenda would
ground its empirics in world history rather than just Western history
(Acharya and Buzan 2019, 301) This is demanding on an instructor whose
subject-matter expertise will be narrow (by dint of academic training)
and whose time will be short given other professional and personal
commitments. Without considerable effort, this is more of an ideal than
a reality. But a good start would be to follow Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 303) admonition to integrate the study of regions, regionalism,
and area studies into the curriculum. In particular, this means offering
case studies, examples, and illustrations drawn from parts of the world
outside the Euro-Atlantic zone. To this we can add Buzan and Lawson's
(2015) case for expanding the temporal remit of international relations
to the nineteenth century. This would break free of the apocryphal
founding myths (Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson 2011) and temporal myopia of
the orthodox discipline (Buzan and Lawson 2014) in order to draw upon a
richer and more global context for the emergence of the modern world. A
worldly curriculum will likely begin rather thin, but over time become
much deeper and more inclusive. Perhaps [more attainable in the
short-term is a pluralistic [pedagogy]{.mark} that [recognizes]{.mark}
**multiple forms of [agency]{.mark}** beyond the state and material
power. Such]{.underline} an approach would entail [a
pedagogy]{.underline} addressing a diverse constellation of actors in
world politics that [offers a faithful representation of an
overwhelmingly complex environment **without reducing it** exclusively
to a handful of Western powers]{.underline}.

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **real-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of **intellectual [openness]{.mark}**, recognizing both the need for
**greater [flexibility]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **theoretical
formulations** [and]{.mark} the **possibility of complementarity** by
**[other theories]{.mark}** and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in]{.mark} its [ability to **tackle future**]{.mark}
**event[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think**]{.mark}
caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified information processing
of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants t]{.mark}o **reveal**
and [**question convictions**]{.mark} which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, [and]{.mark} to **question the [linearity]{.mark} of
world developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both **innovative** in terms of
**scholarship**, and **[policy-relevant]{.mark}** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple**]{.mark} **driving
[forces]{.mark}**, to **take into account different values** they might
take and finally to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see
how they affect the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, makes the
scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work with a
limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate and test
hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single causal
variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [provid]{.mark}ing academia with a tool for
"[**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool
towards]{.mark} **more exchange between academia and
[policy-making]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} can [contribute to]{.mark} a
**better [understanding]{.mark} between the two** worlds. For
policymakers, it provides the opportunity to consider **[long-term
trends]{.mark}**]{.underline} (an occasion not often found in the
day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides insight into
which trends are most concerning for policy-makers, allowing them to
check and ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the **[relevance of]{.mark} their
research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

Conclusion: the paucity of 'better' It seems appropriate to conclude by
commenting on why [it would be futile to attempt to provide a
justification for why postcolonial approaches offer a "better"
explanation of world politics in comparison to other IR
theories.]{.underline} The analysis has shown that traditional IR
theories, and even critical theories such as poststructuralism and
Marxism, operate within the limitations of an epistemology that is
inherently Eurocentric and attached to a vision of world politics that
is excessively temporal, with ontological categories that reflect this
point of view. Even when the European vision of modernity is criticised
from within, this criticism is prone to falling back on these same
categories in order to do so. Instead, a [decolonial epistemology can
create space for a universal that incorporates rather than excludes
difference,]{.underline} while ontological concepts derived from this
epistemology and the non-Western experience can elaborate a vision of
world politics that is more holistic and nuanced. Yet [to say that such
an explanation is "better" seems to negate the very purpose of
postcolonial approaches to IR; to draw attention to the hierarchies
embedded in the international sphere]{.underline} through the past and
ongoing practices and discourses of colonialism and imperialism[.
Describing these approaches as "better" merely engages in the same
tendency towards hierarchy, binaries, and reductionism critiqued in
other approaches.]{.underline} It is for this reason that this essay has
[argued strongly for the importance of postcolonial approaches to
explaining world politics but refuses to reduce these attributes to a
better or worse distinction]{.underline}. Suffice it to say that
postcolonial approaches encourage an understanding of world politics
that truly merits the name.

is at the heart of the nature of power in International
Relations]{.underline}. \"33 Mazrui sees [ideol- ogy, political economy,
and technology as deeply rooted in the cul- tural realm]{.underline},
and views the North-South divide as an increasingly cultural one.
Cultural identity is held to be an issue of increased sig- nificance in
the contemporary world - so much so that, according to Mazrui, we may be
witnessing the \"gradual unravelling of identities based on the state, a
declining of identities based on political ideol- ogy - and the revival
of identities based on culture.\"34 Peter Worsley\'s earlier account of
world development makes similar claims.35 [The in- ternationalization of
culture - youth cults, religious revivalism, con- sumerism, feminism -
are seen as \"powerful evidence that a sense of common identity and a
shared culture can give rise to social move- ments that quickly
transcend the boundaries of any particular soci- ety.\"]{.underline}36
Both Mazrui and Worsley thus see culture as a key determinant of
political and economic processes. [Even the generally econocentric
Immanuel Wallerstein has shifted ground to view culture as \"the key
ideological battleground\" of the opposing interests within the mod- ern
world capitalist system.37]{.underline} These attempts to engage culture
seemingly amount to [a re- spectable interest on the part of
international relations]{.underline}, and it is in- structive to
consider the intellectual background of the three writers discussed.
Wallerstein is a sociologist, and the essay cited above was published in
a collection of sociological articles on nationalism, glob- alization,
and modernity. Mazrui has always cut a distinctive path in international
relations, and his concerns have had more to do with the problems of
Third World justice and identity than with main- stream issues. Worsley,
similarly, has been steeped in the problems of development and
dependency in the Third World. We thus see that many of the perspectives
that have enlivened the discipline have come from outside it and draw on
different source material. Something similar may be said of R. B. J
Walker. Certainly he ha ried a consideration of culture with the issues
of order, power states, but his bearings have been taken from broad
modernity.38 Without belaboring the point, such an analysis is very much
the exception. Walker himself recognizes as much: \'This kind of
literature . . . has emerged largely on the margins of International
Relations as an institutionalized discipline. It remains obscure, even
alien to those whose training has been primarily within the positivis-
tic, realist, or policy-oriented mainstreams.\'139 The contrast with
postcolonialism could not be starker. Where in- ternational relations
has ignored culture, or at most grudgingly con- ceded it a minor role,
postcolonialism has elevated culture to an extraordinary degree.
Although the understanding of culture has changed as the discourse has
evolved, culture has been at the heart of postcolonialism from the
outset. In the first phase of postcolonial- ism, culture was grounded in
the literary context and understood very much in terms of the clash of
values engendered by the colonial encounter. Following
postcolonialism\'s move away from specific texts to a more generalized
account of domination and resistance between North and South, culture
has attained larger explanatory significa- tions. It has come to
encapsulate the very site of struggle and differ- ence between the
so-called margin and the center; the pivot upon which an emergent
postcolonial identity develops. On one view, how- ever, [culture has
been overdone. In its attempt to be at the cutting edge of academic
discourse, postcolonialism can be accused of hav- ing overstretched the
analytical utility of culture]{.underline}. Yet such a perspec- tive
underplays the significance of the cultural reorientation; it is
precisely through culture that postcolonialism mounts a fundamental
challenge to the epistemological bases of established regimes of
thinking such as international relations. In this respect its effect has
been overwhelmingly positive. To this point, the burden of our analysis
has been to suggest that [international relations and postcolonialism
pass like ships in the night. We have highlighted possible intersections
and potential sites of engagement, the idea being that both discourses
might be en- riched through a process of cross-fertilization. Such
enrichment would follow partly from the very fact of
difference]{.underline}. We now want to direct attention to three key
areas of difference in which [engagement might have real significance,
not only for each discourse but more generally for our broader concern
with approaches to the North- South divide. The first relates to power
and representation, the sec- ond to modernity, and the third to
emotional commitment and radicalism.]{.underline} In the process of
contestation and comparison, the hope is that [we can get a better
handle on understanding issues such as power and modernity as they bear
upon the relationship between the North and South. Both discourses have
distinct strengths and weak- nesses and bring different perspectives to
bear on the issues at hand. In seeking a dialogue and making assessments
about what we might learn from their diferences, we can begin to bridge
the discourses to their mutual benefit.]{.underline}

## K \-- Capitalism

### 1NC \-- Thesis \-- Racial Capitalism

**Racial capitalism commodifies black people -- it has sustained the
violent idea that black people are worth more dead than alive --
empirically proven after recent protests**

Crystal **Eddins**, 8-14-20**20**, (\"Racial Capitalism, Legacies of
Slavery, and Social Movements,\" AAIHS,
<https://www.aaihs.org/racial-capitalism-legacies-of-slavery-and-social-movements/>)
//pk

On Friday, June 5, 2020, the [Fox News cable news network aired a
graphic depicting stock market performance during periods of civil
unrest following high-profile killings of Black men in the United
States.]{.underline} The graphic showed increases to the S&P 500 in the
midst of racial and economic crises. It insinuated that despite social
upheaval, the death of Black men was beneficial for the stock market. As
the graphic quickly displayed across the television screen, anchor Susan
Li reported: "Market highs despite the nationwide protests this week,
historically there has been a disconnect between what investors focus on
and what happens across the rest of the country. For instance, in 1968,
the week after the tragedy of Martin Luther King, the S&P 500 rose over
two percent, also up the week after the Rodney King ruling and Wall
Street trading on the reopening instead this year in 2020." The Fox News
network is well-known for propagating conservative, right-wing ideals
and misrepresenting truths to an extent that exceeds the incredulous.
[Even with their regular pattern of untruths and racially inflammatory
broadcasts, viewers were shocked by the S&P 500 graphic. The network has
since apologized for the insensitivity of the graphic and seem to have
removed the segment video from the internet, but they did not recant the
Dow Jones market data that Li reported.]{.underline} The graphic, and
[it]{.underline}s explanation, [imply that Black death is good for the
economy.]{.underline} Are Black people worth more dead than alive? What
can we learn about this data point and the way in which the logic of
racial capitalism continues to operate? Further thought about the
meaning behind this graphic, and the motivation for composing it,
harkens back to the long history of commodifying Black bodies. [In
Saltwater Slavery, Stephanie Smallwood examined the moments captive
Africans' lives were reduced to units of exchange at coastal African
slave castles and on slave ships as enslavers aimed to maximize profit
at each stage of the Middle Passage. Daina Ramey Berry's The Price for
Their Pound of Flesh also traces the process by which enslavers,
traders, and doctors placed monetary value on enslaved African Americans
throughout the life cycle, beginning with preconception and ending with
the trade of enslaved people's cadavers.]{.underline} Amy Bride's "Dead
or Alive: Racial Finance and the Corpse-Value of the African American
Slave Body" similarly argues that the rise of finance markets signaled a
historical change in which Black bodies became more valuable dead than
alive. My own [research on colonial Haiti revealed a four-fold increase
of captive Africans' purchase prices between the West Central African
Loango coast and the prices of sale at ports like Cap-Français
(Cap-Haïtien) in the 1780s]{.underline}. While sugar and coffee prices
climbed throughout the late eighteenth century, the price values
assigned to the enslaved grew at a much slower place -- representing a
decline in slave values in absolute terms compared to values of the
popular crops.1 The ratios of slave prices and crop prices is not only a
convenient statistic[, it had real life implications -- especially
considering the reputation of colonial Haiti as one of the deadliest
slave colonies in the Americas due to excesses of labor and
violence.]{.underline} Increased crop prices incentivized working the
enslaved to death, extracting as much energy as possible before they
were discarded and replaced with another cohort of captives from Africa.
**[Enslaved people were fetishized and commodified as property that was
valued less than commodities.]{.underline}** It is frightening to
wonder: was the data presented in the S&P 500 graphic accurate, and if
so, why? What can help account for the stock market's apparent
profiteering from Black death? According to research by The Action
Center on Race & the Economy, "police brutality bonds" are one avenue by
which wealth is transferred "from communities -- especially over-policed
communities of color -- to Wall Street and wealthy investors" in the
wake of egregious police misconduct cases. Cities often face a fiscal
crisis when they are held liable for acts of police violence and are
mandated to pay out sizeable settlements and judgement costs. To borrow
funds to cover these costs, cities issue municipal bonds, or what the
Action Center calls "police brutality bonds," in exchange for large
amounts of money to meet their budget needs. Money market funds and
other institutions or individuals purchase the bonds and loan money to
the cities, and banks underwrite the bonds and gain interest and fees.
The Action Center has identified several cities and counties across the
United States that issue municipal bonds to cover the growing costs of
police brutality settlements at the expense of taxpayers, while banks
and other financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and
Bank of America benefit from interest and fees. Combined case study data
from Chicago, Cleveland, Lake County, Indiana, Los Angeles, and
Milwaukee from 2010 to 2017 showed that showed that \$837.8 million in
police brutality bonds were issued with banks profiting as much as an
additional \$891 million, costing taxpayers a total of \$1.7 billion.
The emotional toll of death in Black communities is only compounded when
municipalities compensate the victims of police violence with funds that
allow the financial sector to accumulate wealth from those very
communities. As the Action Center argues, these extractive practices
only exacerbate the economic hardships that poor Black communities and
government entities have already faced, especially since the 2008 global
financial crisis, and serve to solidify existing structures of power and
racial inequality. The [financialization of public funds and our
everyday lives results in anti-Black outcomes and is based on
historically-informed logics of global capitalism that commodifies Black
bodies and extracts wealth from Black communities through failed
policing, resource expropriation, and gentrification in the housing
sector. The violent effects of anti-Blackness combined with capital
accumulation have global implications]{.underline} but are most
immediately felt within local communities. Most recently, lawyers
representing the family of Breonna Taylor, a young Black woman killed in
her home by Louisville police on March 13, 2020, allege that the
"no-knock" warrant the Place Based Investigations crime unit and
Louisville Metro Police Department executed was only one part of a
larger gentrification project. The lawyers claim Louisville mayor Greg
Fischer has championed a project called Vision Russell that entails
clearing out residents of the west-side neighborhood where Breonna lived
to develop "modern, futuristic looking homes, a café, an amphitheater, a
state-of-the-art fitness center and more." No arrests have been made in
connection with Breonna Taylor's death, though the FBI has recently
opened an investigation into the likely civil rights violations
committed by the police who killed her. The ongoing Black Lives Matter
movement is now the largest protest movement in United States history.
But early "[Black Spring" protests also included incidents of so-called
"looting" and "rioting" in major cities across the country where Black,
white, and Latinx youth (as well as anarchists and provocateurs)
expropriated goods and destroyed property. While many see these actions
as a detriment to the credibility of peace protest movements, a more
critical analysis of the variety of actions that shape insurgency
through the lens of racial capitalism reveals deeper motivations and
critiques of societal inequalities. Property damage may be considered a
repudiation of the fundamental principle of racial capitalism that
values property over Black people.]{.underline} [These actions, in the
context of an unprecedented wealth gap, mass incarceration, and
environmental, political, and health crises, urge us to demystify the
myriad of ways global capitalism has "looted" Black people and Black
communities, and to imagine a world free from the deadly implications of
commodifying Black life and valuing property over people.]{.underline}

combine political economy and race in his analysis of transnational
pollution, although Heynen (2015) has made some important moves in this
direction. I build on Pellow's work as well as research from critical
ethnic studies to argue that **[[environmental racism is part of racial
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ethnic Studies scholars have long
grappled with the relationship between racism and capitalism (Barrera,
1979; Marable, 1983; Almaguer, 1994). Cedric Robinson coined the term
racial capitalism in Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical
Tradition. First published in 1983, he argued that racism was a
structuring logic of capitalism. His work did not initially circulate
beyond a small circle of scholars (e.g. Kelley, 1990; Gilmore, 2007),
but the rise of critical ethnic studies (Ma´rquez and Rana, 2015) has
introduced a new generation to it. While this is new to some (Bonds and
Inwood, forthcoming; Driscoll Derickson, 2014; Ruiz, 2015), there is, in
fact, older geographic scholarship that sees capitalism as deeply racial
(Wilson, 1992; Blaut, 1993; Woods, 1998; Gilmore, 2002). Thus, the ideas
are not necessarily new. What is new is the term, the intellectual
moment, and the political urgency. [[**The time is ripe for a deep
engagement with racial capitalism.** **A focus on racial capitalism
requires greater attention to the essential processes that shaped the
modern world, such as colonization, primitive accumulation, slavery, and
imperialism.**]{.underline}]{.mark} As McKittrick notes, '**[[the
geographic management of blackness, race, and racial difference (and
thus non-blackness) hinges on a longstanding but unacknowledged
plantation past']{.underline}]{.mark}** (2011: 953**[[). By insisting
that we are still living with the legacy of these processes, racial
capitalism requires that we place contemporary forms of racial
inequality in a materialist, ideological and historical
framework.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2NC \-- Root Cause \-- Colonialism

#### Capitalism is the root cause of colonialism -- profit motives and exportation of culture created incentives for colonization 

**Smiley 9** (Maurice Smiley, 12-11-2009, Accessed 7-13-2020, Abstract:
Root Cause of Colonialism, Maurice Smiley Blogspot,

Lex KK 

[There is little doubt that colonialism has changed the face of the
planet]{.underline} and continues to affect postcolonial societies in a
number of different ways.  Fusing of cultures, religion, economics, and
language are but of few of the results of postcolonialism.  Some
societies have adapted markedly well while others have fallen into
abject poverty, civil war, social unrest, and in extreme cases
extinction. Regardless of the outcomes, [this essay examines the texts
we have read throughout the semester in an effort to determine the
underlying reason ,or the \"why\", for colonialism in the first place.
The answer is undoubtedly capitalism.]{.underline}¶[ In examining
colonial Europe, the common thread found in examining the question of
why colonialism happened can be seen clearly in Joseph Conrad\'s \"Heart
of Darkness\", Chinua Achebe\'s \"Things Fall Apart\", and V.S.
Naipaul\'s \"The Mimic Men\". These novels show how
the Europeans used various pretexts for
rationalizing the colonization of other countries, in order to pave the
way for private enterprise to make money. Looking into more recent
history, Ha Jin\'s story, \"After Cowboy Chicken Came to Town\" shows
how America, a postcolonial society itself, uses capitalism as a means
of spreading culture and values to other countries]{.underline}. Future
evidence of [capitalism\'s role in colonialism can be
examined]{.underline} in the Neal Stephenson\'s \"The Diamond Age\". In
\"The Diamond Age\", we [see a future \"globalized\" world that
is controlled by tribes instead of countries.]{.underline} In [examining
the relationship between the tribes and globalization, we see evidence
that the most successful tribes are really technology
corporations who\'s citizens are members of the
corporate culture]{.underline}.¶ Pundits may argue that there were other
reasons for colonialism, such as religion, and that capitalism played a
secondary role. Jared Diamond\'s \"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of
Human Societies\", [Diamond provides evidence through historical
facts that the driving force behind colonialism was completely based
on capitalism.  Further evidence can be found in Juan Gonzalez\'s
\"Harvest Empire\" where he explores the history behind Spanish
colonialism and provides compelling evidence that colonialism is rooted
in capitalism.]{.underline} 

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Black Feminism

**Advocacies of black feminism result in the hypervisibility and
ultimately solve nothing when violence is a product of racial
capitalism**

**Lowendtheory**, 05-14-20**13** ("On Audre Lorde's Legacy and the
"Self" of Self-Care, Part 2 of 3," Lowendtheory,
https://www.lowendtheory.org/post/50428216600/on-audre-lordes-legacy-and-the-self-of)//pk

[Audre Lorde didn't die a natural death. She died an institutionally
produced one]{.underline}, a death that was generated at the level of
social infrastructure. [I want us to learn to regard Audre Lorde's death
as an effect of racial capitalism---its fundamentally unequal
provisioning of wealth and social goods, its ableist and productivist
standards as to what constitutes a healthy person, its fashioning of
health care as a private commodity rather than as a fundamental right,
and its particular commingling of sexism and racism that at one and the
same time materializes the constant demand that black women work and
renders the work they do invisible. The conditions that produced Audre
Lorde's death]{.underline}, in other words, [might also serve as a
reminder that in the aggregate, black women bear a disproportionate
share of racial capitalism's propensity to work its workers to
death]{.underline}. And a major feature of these death-making conditions
is to be found in the ways in which it is structured so as to refuse to
recognize as work what so many black women do for themselves, for each
other, and for their communities---this may include but is not limited
to the largely unwaged work of cooking, cleaning, raising, educating,
and caring for children and adults in its myriad forms. (This is the
work, to paraphrase part of the most overlooked chapter of Angela
Davis's Women, Race, and Class, that no one notices until it's not
done.) To reiterate, **[these death-making conditions serve as a motor
for racial capitalism not only through the erasure, devaluation, and
naturalization of life-making and life-sustaining]{.underline}** (also
called \"reproductive") work that women are expected to learn to do, to
do, and to love doing,\[1\] but also because through the erasure of
"women's work" as work, they serve to compel and coerce workers to
accept waged labor above and beyond the work they already perform. [This
compulsion and coercion regularly takes the form of the form of the
stigmatization and surveillance of poor people and poor women
especially, who use governmental assistance to survive. And again, here,
black women bear the brunt of the burden of capitalism's stigmatization
of the poor (of color).]{.underline} \"Welfare," as Dorothy Roberts puts
it, \"has become a code word for race." By which she means: a code word
for blackness. Think here of the sheer prominence of the "welfare queen"
stereotype (and its deployment to make common sense out of the notion
that black women who use governmental assistance are parasitic on the
social body). [Think]{.underline} here, also, [how the racializing and
gendering of that stereotype authorizes the constant surveillance to
which welfare recipients are regularly and systematically subjected,
surveillance whose purpose it is to call into doubt the ability of
welfare recipients to make fitting choices]{.underline} in deciding how
and what to feed themselves (and those that depend upon them), how and
what they should consume. It matters that [Audre Lorde, by virtue of a
class mobility that materialized in the form of advanced degrees,
international recognition and renown, and semi-stable employment with
what were clearly circumscribed "health benefits," may have been able to
escape the worst of the state-sanctioned, Reaganomics-fueled state
surveillance directed towards poor black women.\[2]{.underline}\] And
[it]{.underline} also [matters that the racializing and gendering
project of the capitalism that underwrites that surveillance also shaped
the conditions in which she lived and died in ways that are too rarely
recognized. We in the U.S. left are well trained to express outrage when
black lives are stolen in spectacular events---not only in the
assassinations of "our" Malcolms and Martins, but even in the executions
of our less famed Emmetts and Oscars and Trayvons. Yet we are
not]{.underline} always [best equipped to organize against the politics
that produce deaths not in spectacular (and regular), direct,
face-to-face expressions of violence but rather, through other, less
readily visible, rhythms and structures of everyday life.]{.underline}
[To ask that we regard Audre Lorde's death as the outcome of a politics
(and not just a disease) is both to invoke Lorde less as an exceptional
figure than as a powerfully exemplary one, and to direct our attention
to how the murderousness of capitalism expresses itself where it is most
mundane.\[3\]]{.underline} Mundane murderousness, slow death (which may
in many cases not be slow at all), has taken institutional form in part
as a consequence of the consolidation of health care as a for-profit
industry that defines health as the capacity to work. ["Health," in this
context, is measured by the health of racial capitalism. Such a
definition means that being healthy is understood as having the capacity
to optimize your ability to be exploited. No medical leave, then, for
the English prof who's battling cancer. No capacity, then, to decide for
herself what her health needs are and to act on that decision---the
social infrastructure of neoliberalism has already coded giving its
workers that much freedom, that kind of autonomy, as an unaffordable
extravagance.]{.underline} Care as extravagance. Historically speaking,
it is here, in the Reagan era, that the "self" of self-care emerged.
Donald Vickery and James Fries's bestseller Take Care of Yourself: A
Consumer's Guide to Medical Care was published in 1981, and formed part
of a larger explosion of "self-help" publications that encouraged a
readership increasingly clobbered by a neoliberal assault---against
liveable wages, workers rights, social services, and the welfare state
writ large---to take it upon themselves to manage the consequences of
that clobbering. And I would argue that the "self" of self-care came
into being precisely as an effect of that management, as well as of the
clobbering that both preceded and accompanied it. It euphemizes as a
goodwill gesture (the benevolent "take care of yourself!") an imperative
that, if elaborated, looks much more like a relation of coercion and
discipline ("take care of yourself or your job will go to someone who
does"; "take care of yourself lest you fall ill and get saddled with
medical debt"; "take care of yourself because you have no right to
expect that society will"; "take care of yourself...or else"). The self
of self-care, all of this is to say, has a history that should serve as
a caution toward attempts to make self-care an unqualified good. It is a
self that is specifically calibrated as a defensive reaction to the
combination of austerity politics with reinvigorated forms of gendered
racism that cut across the entire social formation. Especially for those
of us who were born and/or grew up in the Reagan and Bush I eras, the
self of self-care was the form of selfhood that hegemonic institutions
taught us to internalize. This is not to say that there is nothing of
value to be found in the language of practice of self-care. It is to
suggest, rather, that self-care is not simply a form of struggle but the
outcome of various struggles that have played out on a larger scale than
we tend to acknowledge when we speak of it. This struggle involved,
among other things, the disqualification of initiatives by the radical
labor movement to establish universal health care as a right rather than
a "benefit" restricted to and contingent upon employment in certain
sectors. It involved the marginalization of years of efforts by the
Black Panther Party and the National Welfare Rights Organization both to
establish community clinics and to redefine health care not as a
commodity but as both a fundamental question of justice and a condition
of community self-determination.\[4\] With all of this said, what do we
make of this Audre Lorde quote?: "Caring for myself is not
self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of
political warfare." It is both thrilling and affirming, I think, to sit
with the possibilities of redefining self-care as though it were going
on the political offensive. This may especially be the case in a context
where the dominant meaning of "care" either has become industrialized in
such a way that it consolidates (instead of contests) one's\'alienation
from her conditions of existence, or from the means necessary to inform
herself about, determine, and pursue the course of care and wellbeing
that she needs. But what I think is especially important about this now
regularly cited quotation is what comes before the first comma, what
comes before, that is, the moment when self-care finds its euphemistic,
sunny resolution as "political warfare": the disavowal of self-care as
"self indulgence." What, after all, is wrong with self-indulgence, with
stealing time to enjoy the self, to pursue ways of being and living that
are not necessarily productive, even if to do so is to steal away from
the justifiably voracious appetites of left political desire? Lorde's
rewriting of self-care as political warfare seems to me to be
symptomatic of a philosophy of movement building that has an
unacknowledged investment in surveilling the behavior of its members
(and demanding that they surveil themselves), a philosophy that is so
deeply committed to the idea that everything is political that it cannot
see the ways it enforces that definition through the implicit demand
that its members justify all their behavior on its terms. Everything is
political, in other words, can be a particularly disciplinary and
disciplining definition of the political because of the way that it
privileges a kind of ruthless scrutiny, assessment, and justification of
one's behaviors on the basis of whether or not they generate political
value. At the same time, it tends to regard the political less as a
contestation over social transformation than as the sum total of "good"
or "bad" political behaviors. At worst, everything is political can
privilege a kind of left version of austerity logic, one that calls
implicitly for the abstention from behaviors that don't serve the Higher
Purpose of generating and assessing individual behavior in the form of
political value. It can only handle self-indulgence and extravagance
when those things can be given a justifiable political form, when they
can be commended or valorized, in other words, for how radical they are.
It can only handle self-indulgence and extravagance, in other words,
when they cease to be self-indulgent or extravagant at all, and claim,
on the flip, to be productive and progressive. [Austerity logics,
whether they come from the left or the right, get articulated through
the bodies of black women by making certain kinds of demands on them. An
important thing to understand about these demands is that **they do not
simply take the form of general devaluation**.]{.underline} They do not
simply take the form of the welfare queen stereotype. [**They can also
take the form of a general overinvestment or hypervaluation**---in
feelings and performances of excessive admiration, deference, and high
regard. They can inhabit the expectation---an expectation that, again,
can have the force of a demand---that black women embody a kind of
superhuman strength, or that they inherently possess an exceedingly
resolute political consciousness. Unlike the bad faith that underwrites
the demonization of black women as unproductive, **this leftist
hypervaluation of black women often takes the form of
love.**]{.underline} Love: [**Killing love,** perhaps. It is the kind of
love **that solicits a constant performance from black women, one that
demands that they be endlessly productive**, endlessly working, for the
movement, even after death.]{.underline} It is for this reason that I
spent some time in the last post attempting to contest the deification
of Lorde: I want to make visible just how much work is implicitly called
for in the desire for black women to be adequate to what is asked of
them--which they very well may also want of themselves. The [point is
that any politics that seeks to celebrate the seemingly superhuman
accomplishments of black women can become the unwitting collaborator
with the entire field of the political that we might want to contest, a
field in which the superhuman demands placed on black women are nothing
short of murderous]{.underline}. The point is, while it may appear to
honor the Audre Lordes (1934-1992) and the Barbara Christians
(1943-2000) and the VèVè Clarks (1944-2007) and the Sherley Anne
Williamses (1944-1999) with the demand that they rest in power, there
may also be an ethics, if not also a justice, in insisting on their
right to rest in peace. And the point is that our discussions about self
care are particularly impoverished when they fail to engage broader
questions about the structure of health care, the social distribution of
wealth, and the conditions in which we live and work. This is the thread
I'll pick up in the third and final installment of this piece by
addressing last year's series of debates on self-care and community
care.

Studies from University of California Berkeley, dissertation entitled
"The Modern Capitalist State and the Black Challenge: Culturalism and
the Elision of Political Economy," pgs. 13-16)

Even though contemporary articulations of the African diaspora became
abstracted from radical enunciations of Blackness, and became a form of
cultural critical practice, of mutual recognition against the
universality of black misrepresentation and abjection, and an
articulation of the politics of identity and representation, **[the
Black radical structure of feeling]{.underline}** nonetheless [provided
the grammar and]{.underline} the [pedagogy to critique and challenge
regimes of coloniality]{.underline}79 [that sustain]{.underline} the
trans-spatial and trans-temporal conditions of [Black
abjection]{.underline}. It created an intellectual map for theories of
the African diaspora to reflect anticolonial and antiracist grievance
articulated in the conjunctural space of black radical consciousness.
[Unlike post-Cold War articulations of Blackness, the Black radical
structure of feeling inflected a heterogeneous critique imbued
with]{.underline} not only cultural, but also
**[structural]{.underline}**, **[anticapitalist]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[anti-imperialist foundations]{.underline}**. ["New
Negro Culturalism"]{.underline}---the Harlem Renaissance enunciation of
Black radicalism---[had yet to become the hegemonic mode of theorizing
and asserting Blackness]{.underline}, [so the project of constructing
Black modern subjectivity became inhered in **a robust theoretical
framework**]{.underline} [that included structural critiques of
capitalist exploitation]{.underline}, analyses of racialization, and the
politicization of cultural production.

[This dissertation seeks to comprehensively refocus the analytical
frameworks dealing with black modern subjectivity through an in-depth
examination of **"[Culturalism]{.mark},"**]{.underline} [or [the regime
of meaning-making in which Blackness is **culturally
specified**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[and abstracted from
material]{.mark}, [political economic]{.mark}, [and structural
conditions of dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline}** [through state
technologies of antiradicalism]{.underline}. As Deborah Thomas explains,
"Herein lies the root of the epistemological violence generated by the
turn to \[C\]ulturalis\[m\]\... The question of where black populations
stood in relation to states\... became secondary to the question of how
blacks in the West were connected to roots, to Africa\... [[the language
of cultural politics]{.underline}]{.mark}\... **[[abandons the impetus
within internationalism toward imagining political
community]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It derails]{.mark} a more global
political [economic analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}\..."80 Herskovitsian
cultural analysis, which asserted Black humanity and equality based on
evidence of African cultural legacy,81 inaugurated the shift from
political economy to "the language of moralism."82 The focus on cultural
continuity did not take into account historical conditions of forced
labor, racialized oppression, colonial imposition, or capitalist
exploitation;83 instead it codified the "assumption that the history and
culture of peoples of African descent in the New World have to be argued
out anthropologically in terms of an identifiable authentic past
persisting into the present."84 The latter was determined to be the key
to citizenship and equality for Blacks. Cold War Culturalism
institutionalized the hegemony of antiradical cultural politics by
foregrounding cultural analyses of African retention and syncretism,
cultural continuity, and comparative diasporic cultures. As the Cold War
instantiated the bifurcation of the world and influenced the direction
of decolonization, "diaspora became reduced to its cultural aspects\...
the question of origins became a question of culture." It essentially
framed connections among African descendants in terms of culture;
asserted Black modernity and claims to equality on cultural grounds; and
constructed culture as the domain of struggle. [[Culturalism divorced
Blackness and the]{.mark} African [diaspora from **the material realties
of governmentalized**]{.mark}**, [transnational state projects]{.mark}**
[that sustain racial and class hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline}.85

The hegemony of Culturalism in contemporary theories of the Black
condition and the African diaspora diverge significantly from those of
the Black radical structure of feeling that conceptualized the Diaspora
(thought not explicitly named at this time) through a nexus that
included political economy, cultural formations, and nationalism.
Conditions of Black abjection were seen to permeate both the base and
the superstructure such that mobilization on both fronts was necessary
to combat white supremacy. [The ascendance of New Negro Culturalism as
the progenitor of, and]{.underline} therefore the [predominate structure
in, post-Cold War theories of the African diaspora is the unfortunate
consequence of **the entanglements of anticommunism**]{.underline},
**[antiradicalism]{.underline}**, **[and antiblackness]{.underline}**.
[The result has been a turn away from the political economy/structural
critique that, in the interwar period, **provided a theoretical
framework to challenge American antiblack statist
discourse**]{.underline}. [The marginalization of Black]{.underline}
radicalism and [political economy produced **the politicization of
culture**]{.underline} [as the dominant mode of organizing for Black
equality]{.underline}, and the primary intellectual focus in African
diaspora studies. Post-Cold War theories of the African diaspora became
divorced from the Black radical structure of feeling and reduced to the
Harlem Renaissance enunciation of black radicalism in a manner that does
not sufficiently theorize the conditions of Black abjection and their
connection to the material realities of Black people.

[[Culturalism]{.mark} supports the constitution and maintenance of
Blackness as a category of]{.underline} economic exploitation and
dispossession and [racialized abjection]{.underline} in three
fundamental ways. First, [it [reinscribes the Black **on the margins of
the state**]{.mark}]{.underline} [by accommodating Blackness in a way
that maintains]{.underline} their [subordination and subjection on
cultural grounds]{.underline}. [[The foregrounding of]{.mark} **the
culture**]{.underline}, behavior, **[and [performance]{.mark} of Black
people]{.underline}** [[leaves the effects of inequality]{.mark},
increased [poverty]{.mark}, [unemployment]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
structural features of [the]{.mark} global [political economy]{.mark} on
Black people largely [undertheorized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, on the
one hand, deteriorating conditions of Black people globally are
understood as innate cultural lack or pathology. On the other hand, [[it
is assumed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Black empowerment and equality
can be achieved in]{.mark} **the struggle over [cultural
representation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both of [these positions
reproduce cultural specifications of Blackness that negate the role
of]{.underline} state and **[capitalist structures]{.underline}** [in
its production and maintenance]{.underline}.

Second, Culturalism creates the condition for the Black that is
inscribed in the modern project to "niggerize"86 radical Blacks who
present a fundamental threat to the organization of global and statist
structures on the basis of racialized capitalist exploitation.
Culturalism asserts a particular outlook, behavior, and set of goals for
Black people,87 and those who deviate from these norms that are
ostensibly shared by the entire group are cast out. In other words,
culture is asserted to rationalize the marginalization of those who
occupy the constitutive outside of the state because they have been
construed as seditious, subversive, and dangerous. The latter are
foreclosed from belonging and are therefore subjected to the violation
of their civil liberties, confinement, and deportation. By severely
curtailing the possibilities, potential, and forms of freedom of those
who are inscribed in the modern project and niggerizing those who are
not, Culturalism ultimately functions as a technology of state
repression and subjection.

Third, [[Culturalism has the dual function of **erasing political
economy**]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a means of understanding and
critiquing the Black condition, [and]{.mark} of **[specifying Black
articulations of freedom and equality in terms of
culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

\[A\]nalyses of race and class began to privilege a focus on culture
over a focus on socioeconomic inequality. This had both academic and
practical effects. Academically, it supported a liberal view of
development that naturalized capitalist competition and that positioned
the cultural\... practice of middle-class white Americans as
normative\... practically, the cultural model\... directed attention
away from the overall political economy of American capitalism and of
how it 'uses, abuses, and divides its poorly organized working
class'\...88

Anticommunism entrenched this move away from structural analysis by
criminalizing and disciplining critiques of the entanglements of the
racialized social order, the spread of empire, and capitalist
accumulation. [Instead of challenging their exclusion from the state
based on economic dispossession and maldistribution of resources, Black
people in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [began to
mobilize around **cultural specification**]{.underline}, for inclusion
based on liberal civil rights discourse, and/or to assert international
linkages based on mutually recognized cultural enunciations of
blackness. In other words, [the Cold War curtailed the possibilities of
challenging the state in terms of **the political economy of
exploitation**]{.underline}, [thus Blackness came to be understood in
**nationalist and cultural terms of exclusion**]{.underline}. At the
same time, decolonizing countries that sought equality in the
world-system asserted their willingness and ability to adopt the culture
of development, modernization, and anticommunism. This was
notwithstanding the fact that their insertion into the global political
economy as sovereign nations continued relations of unequal exchange,
declining terms of trade, and neocolonialism.89

[Culturalism is thus a function of **antiradical and antiblack statist
pedagogy**]{.underline}, [and after World War II, it became entangled
with anticommunism as an instrumentality of surveillance and
violence]{.underline}. [Culturalism institutionalized the erasure of
radical political economic critique in the theorizing of the black
global condition]{.underline}, the disciplining of Black radicalism, and
the cultural specification of African diaspora studies examined in this
dissertation. [[The cultural specification of Blackness]{.mark} and the
forms of Culturalism that it takes [are integrally related to **statist
technologies**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that facilitate the accommodation
of Black intellect]{.mark}ual and practical challenges [to the
capitalist state while]{.mark}, at the same time, **[ensuring their
cooptation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These are the bases for the
surveillance, disciplining, and punishment of black radical critique.

**Burden-Stelly 16** -- (Charisse Burden-Stelly, PhD in African-American
Studies from University of California Berkeley, dissertation entitled
"The Modern Capitalist State and the Black Challenge: Culturalism and
the Elision of Political Economy," pgs. 192-194)

[By the 1980s, there was an emergent emphasis on [cultural
affinity]{.mark}]{.underline} and connection in Africana studies [that
**[neglected the convergence of]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[material
experiences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the structural organization of
political economy among Blacks in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Great Britain, Africa, and the Caribbean in the
wake of **a neoliberal agenda that produced a rollback of the state and
its reformulation**]{.underline}. [This was instantiated through
Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and Structural Adjustment]{.underline} that
accompanied the collapse of the socialist/communist alternative.
[Despite this global restructuring, popular and scholarly understandings
of]{.underline} American and "diasporic" [Blackness **did not involve a
critique of political economy**]{.underline}. An explanation of this
elision will shed light on the conditions through and by which Africana
studies shifted from its political, activist, and community-oriented
distinctiveness to a Culturalist academic project. In other words,
[political economy became marginalized in the process of cultural
specification of Africana studies]{.underline}.

[Such overdetermination became evident in the **"[debates]{.mark}"
taking place [within the discipline]{.mark}**]{.underline} focused
around postcolonial studies/Black British Cultural Studies (BBCS),
African American studies,1 and Afrocentricity. [Each perspective
**[posed culture as the critical site of struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[for the Black **[without any fundamental critique of political
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even though the postcolonial/Black
British model ultimately became the point of reference and assumed near
hegemonic status, it became highly modified and challenged by American
scholars who felt that the antiessentialist, decentered, and ethnicized
study of Black culture distorted and marginalized the experience of
African Americans and obfuscated the peculiar dynamics of U.S.
racialization. In the final analysis, [the ubiquity of [this]{.mark}
"[debate]{.mark}" [further marginalized radical]{.mark} intellectual
thought and [political economic critique because the latter was **deemed
irrelevant to that narrow and myopic conversation based on
culture**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As a result, Africana studies
has]{.underline} largely [produced **a cadre of alienated, privatized,
culture experts**]{.underline} [who are **unable to critically engage**
with the structural and material realities out of which the Black
condition is forged]{.underline}. [The discipline has produced a
"technical intelligentsia"]{.underline} who is generally fit only to
reproduce the "bureaucratic\... apparatus" and whose "rationality\... is
only instrumental in character."2 [For this reason, the discipline has
become unable]{.underline}, in its fundamentals, [to engage
**significant issues of material abjection and political
economy**]{.underline}.

According to Martin Kilson, the maturation of Africana Studies was
accomplished by and through the process of its "disciplinizing" and the
proliferation of its most important innovation---Black cultural studies.
Constituted by the overlapping of literary studies with psychological
and societal studies, Black cultural studies provided an alternative
Black ethnocentrism (Afrocentrism), and served as the primary source of
enrichment of Africana Studies.3 His position is part of a debate that
effectively materialized into a cultural critique of the culture concept
that involved the three primary factions named above. [What was being
disputed and contested was not the assertion that culture was the
primary means of understanding Blackness and the Black
condition]{.underline}. [Rather, [the debate centered on]{.mark} **the
meaning of culture and how it should be articulated**]{.underline};
**[[what was at stake in particular narratives of Black]{.mark}/African
[culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [[and **what the effects on**]{.mark}
**Africana Studies [epistemology would be if one method of engaging
culture was chosen over another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It questioned
**how culture should be operationalized**]{.underline}, **[what methods
and analytics best served the new disciplinary
specification]{.underline}**, [and **how relations of power were
constituted by and instantiated through culture in the lives of Black
people**]{.underline}. The impetus for this debate was the growing
influence of postcolonial studies/British cultural studies in the U.S.
academy generally, and particularly of Black British Cultural Studies in
Africana Studies.

The institutionalization and professionalization of Africana studies
essentially collapsed the discipline into the study of Black culture.
This was reified by the introduction of Black British Cultural Studies
into the U.S. academy. The work and analytics of Paul Gilroy, Stuart
Hall, Hazel Carby, Kobena Mercer, and other Black Britons were central
to the epistemological transformation that resulted in African diaspora
studies. This served in many ways to secure its legitimacy. The shift to
African diaspora studies was predicated upon the appropriation and
decontextualization of the tropes, concepts, and analytics of BBCS and a
move away from historically and contextually specific Black American
critiques of the U.S. racial state. As discussed in Chapter Four, the
existent cultural specifications of Africana Studies precluded the
(neo-) Marxist critique inhered in BBCS from taking root in the U.S. As
a result, and unlike BBCS, [African diaspora studies was [unable to make
an impact on Black struggles outside of the academy]{.mark} and on the
structural issues related to these struggles]{.underline}. [Africana
studies challenged the racial epistemologies of the academy, but **[it
fell far short of]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** raised by BBCS **[[that
systematically and deeply engaged the ways in which cultural forms were
inextricably entangled with structures of domination and capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Chapter Four argued that Africana
studies became based on the grammar provided by American studies and the
framework provided by area studies---(inter)disciplines that emerged in
the context of the post-WWII proliferation of U.S. power and authority.
[BBCS satisfied the "need" for **theory, complexity, and
capaciousness**]{.underline} [in Africana studies]{.underline}, which
had come under increasing criticism for ostensibly focusing on "victim
studies" and "oppression studies." [The ready acceptance]{.underline} of
BBCS [by the American academy, though selective and partial, was due to
the ways in which its **abstracted articulations**]{.underline} [fit
neatly within multicultural academic discourse and state
pedagogy]{.underline}. **[Its [cultural focus granted the state and
capital reprieve from critical engagements with the material histories
of racial domination]{.mark}, [exploitation]{.mark}, [and
dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

BBCS will be examined with particular focus on its critiques of the
formulation of African American Studies in the U.S. academy, to
elucidate the divergences in the two projects. As a counterhegemonic
project, the origins and specifications of BBCS were forged as
challenges to the British State and Thatcherism. When transferred to the
U.S. context it proved compatible with the multicultural pedagogy of the
U.S. state and became shorn of its radical critique. The following
assertion by Laura Chrisman's is particularly relevant to Africana
Studies: ["post-modernist intellectual concerns with **language and
subjectivity**]{.underline}\... [infused both academia and 'new Left'
politics to create **a dominant paradigm of 'culturalism'**]{.underline}
[for the analysis of social relations\... \[while\] abandoning the tents
and resources of **socio-economic analysis**]{.underline}."4 Next, the
Africana Studies "culture wars" will be unpacked to explicate the ways
in which a narrow focus on African American Studies, Afrocentricity, and
an Americanized version of BBCS foreclosed the possibility of Black
radicalism and political economy critique in the discipline. Finally,
the role of Culturalism will be elucidated through a critical analysis
of The Black Atlantic---arguably the most important text in the shaping
of African diaspora studies--- written by Paul Gilroy in 1993. I argue
that Gilroy's preoccupation with the transnational routes of Black
culture decentered the nation-state while reproducing its
epistemological technology: Culturalism. Stated differently, while
Gilroy challenged "methodological nationalism,"5 he did so through the
cultural analytic of "diaspora"/Black Atlantic that reproduced the
logics of nationalism and the nation-state. This explained the wide
acceptance and acclaim received by The Black Atlantic and its acceptance
in the U.S. academy. While The Black Atlantic was subjected to various
forms of criticism, they failed to address the problematics of
Culturalism.

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Infoshop

#### The 1AC is just an infoshop---an organization where radicals meet to discuss ideals in the abstract---this disconnection from society precludes any possibility or revolutionary change. True politics must occur at a level of class consciousness and organizing, they just recreate new elitism and maintain the status quo.

**Olson 2013 (**Joel, associate professor at Northern Arizona
University, "The problem with infoshops and insurrection US anarchism,
movement building, and the racial order", 'Contemporary Anarchist
Studies', published in 2013**)**

[[An infoshop is a space where people can learn about radical
ideas]{.mark}, where radicals can meet other radicals, and where
political work]{.underline} (such as meetings, public forums,
fundraisers, etc.) [can get done]{.underline}. In the infoshop strategy,
infoshops and other "[autonomous zones" model the free
society]{.underline} (Bey 1985). [Building "free spaces" inspires others
to spontaneously create their own, spreading
"counterinstitutions]{.underline}" throughout society to the point where
they become so numerous that they overwhelm the powers that be. Th[e
very creation of anarchist free spaces has revolutionary
implications]{.underline}, then, because it can lead to the "organic"
(i.e. spontaneous, undirected, nonhierarchical) [spreading of such
spaces throughout society in a way that eventually challenges the
state]{.underline}. An insurrection, meanwhile, is the armed uprising of
the people. [According to the insurrection strategy, anarchists acting
in affinity groups or other small informal organizations engage in
actions that encourage spontaneous uprisings in various sectors of
society]{.underline}. As localized insurrections grow and spread, [they
combine into a full-scale revolution that overthrows the state and
capital and makes possible the creation of a free society]{.underline}.3
[Infoshops serve very important functions and any movement needs such
spaces]{.underline}. Likewise, insurrection is a central event in any
revolution, for it turns the patient organizing of the movement and the
boiling anger of the people into an explosive confrontation with the
state. [The [problem is when infoshops and insurrection are seen as
revolutionary strategies]{.mark} in themselves rather than as part of a
broader revolutionary movement]{.underline}. In the infoshop model,
[autonomous spaces become the movement for radical change rather than
serving it. **[The insurrection model tries to replace movement building
with spontaneous upheaval rather than seeing upheaval as an outcome of
social movements]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The [infoshops and
insurrection]{.underline} models, in other words, [both misunderstand
the process of social transformation]{.underline}. [Radical change may
be initiated by spontaneous revolts that are supported by subterranean
free spaces]{.underline}, but [**[these revolts are almost always the
product of prior political movement building]{.underline}**,]{.mark} and
[their gains must be consolidated by political organizations, not the
spaces such organizations use[. **Social movements, then, are central to
radical change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The classical anarchists
understood this well, for they were very concerned to build
working-class movements, such as Bakunin's participation in the
International Working Men's Association, Berkman and Goldman's support
for striking workers, Lucy Parson's work in the International Working
People's Association, and the Wobblies' call for "One Big Union." (To be
sure, there were also practices of building free spaces and engaging in
"propaganda by the deed" in classical anarchism, but these were not the
sole or even dominant approaches.) [Yet surprisingly much of the
contemporary anarchist milieu has abandoned movement
building.]{.underline} In fact, the [infoshops and insurrection models
both seem to be designed, at least in part, to avoid the slow,
difficult, but absolutely necessary work of building mass
movements]{.underline}. Indeed, [anarchist publications]{.underline}
like Green Anarchy [are explicit about this]{.underline}, [deriding
movement building as inherently authoritarian]{.underline} (for example
Morefus n.d.). The anarchist emphasis on hierarchy contributes to this
impatience with movement building because [the kind of political work it
encourages are occasional protests or "actions" against myriad forms of
domination rather than sustained organizing based on a coherent strategy
to win political space in a protracted struggle. **[A revolution is not
an infoshop, or an insurrection, or creating a temporary autonomous
zone, or engaging in sabotage]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [it cannot be so
easy, so evolutionary, so "organic," so absent of difficult political
struggle]{.underline}. A [revolution is an actual historical event
whereby one class overthrows another]{.underline} and -- in the
anarchist ideal -- [thereby makes it possible to abolish all forms of
oppression]{.underline}. Such [**[revolutions are the product of mass
movements]{.mark}**: a large group of people organized in struggle
against the state and/or other institutions of power to achieve their
demands.]{.underline} When movements become powerful enough, when they
sufficiently weaken elites, and when fortune is on their side, they lead
to an insurrection, and then perhaps a revolution. Yet in much of the
anarchist milieu today, [building free spaces and/or creating disorder
are regarded as the movement itself rather than components of
one]{.underline}. [[Neither the infoshops nor insurrection models build
movements that can express the organized power of the working
class]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [the necessary, difficult, slow, and
inspiring process of building movements falls through the cracks between
sabotage and the autonomous zone]{.underline}. Ironically, [this leads
many anarchists to take an elitist approach to political
work]{.underline}. [[Divorced from a social movement, the strategy of
building autonomous zones or engaging]{.mark} in direct action with
[small affinity groups assumes that radicals can start the
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. But **[[revolutionaries don't make
revolutions. Millions of ordinary and oppressed people
do]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Anarchist theory and practice today provides
little sense of how these people are going to be part of the process,
other than to create their own "free spaces" or to spontaneously join
the festivals of upheaval. [[This is an idealistic, ahistorical, and,
ironically, an elitist approach to politics]{.mark}, one that is
curiously separated from the struggles of the oppressed
themselves.]{.underline} C.L.R. James argues that t[he task of the
revolutionary is to recognize, record, and engage: recognize in the
struggles of the working class the effort to build a new society within
the shell of the old; record those struggles and show the working class
this record so they can see for themselves what they are doing and how
it fits into a bigger picture; engage in these struggles with the
working class, participating rather than dominating, earning leadership
rather than assuming it, and applying lessons learned from previous
struggles]{.underline} (James et al. 1974).4 [This is a much more modest
role for revolutionaries than germinating the revolution or
sparking]{.underline} it, and one that is clearly consistent with
anarchist politics. Yet [the [infoshops and insurrectionary models
reject this approach for a top-down one in which anarchists "show the
way" for the people to follow, never realizing that]{.mark} throughout
history, **[revolutionaries]{.mark}** (including anarchist ones) **[have
always been trying to follow and catch up to the masses, not the other
way around.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Postcolonial studies divorced from capitalist analysis reinforce the dominant interest that there is no alternative to the present -- the resulting amnesia regarding collective political action imperils revolutionary change

[Not all students of culture are blind to the Western narcissism
involved in working on the history of pubic hair while **half the
world's population lacks adequate sanitation and survives on less than

studies today]{.underline} [is]{.underline} so-called [**post-colonial
studies**, which]{.underline} [deals with just this dire
condition]{.underline}. Like the discourse of gender and sexuality, [it
has been one of the most precious achievements of cultural
theory]{.underline}. Yet [these ideas have thrived among new generations
who,]{.underline} for no fault of their own, **[can remember little of
world-shaking political importance]{.underline}**. Before the advent of
the so-called war on terrorism, it seemed as though there might be
nothing more momentous for young Europeans to recount to their
grandchildren than the advent of the euro. [Over the]{.underline} dreary
decades of post-1970s conservatism, [the historical sense had grown
**increasingly blunted**]{.underline}, [as it suited those in power that
we should be able to imagine **no alternative to the
present**]{.underline}. [The future would simply be the present
infinitely repeated]{.underline} - or, as the postmodernist remarked,
'the present plus more options'. There are now those who piously insist
on 'historicizing' and who seem to believe that anything that happened
before 1980 is ancient history. [To live in interesting times is
not,]{.underline} to be sure, [an unmixed blessing, It is no particular
consolation to be able to recall the Holocaust, or to have lived through
the Vietnam war]{.underline}. Innocence and amnesia have their
advantages. [There is no point in mourning the blissful days when you
could have your skull fractured by the police every weekend in Hyde
Park.]{.underline} To recall a world-shaking political history is also,
for the political left at least, to recall what is for the most part a
history of defeat. In any case, a new and ominous phase of global
politics has now opened[, which not even the most cloistered of
academics will be able to ignore.]{.underline} Even so, [what has proved
most damaging]{.underline}, at least before the emergence of the
anticapitalist movement, [is the absence of memories of **collective**,
and **effective**, **political action**]{.underline}. [it is this which
has warped so many contemporary cultural ideas out of
shape.]{.underline} [There is a historical vortex at the centre of our
thought which drags it out of true.]{.underline} Much of the world as we
know it, despite its solid, wellupholstered appearance, is of recent
vintage. It was thrown up by the tidal waves of revolutionary
nationalism which swept the globe in the period after the Second World
War, tearing one nation after another from the grip of Western
colonialism. The Allies' struggle in the Second World War was itself a
successful collaborative action on a scale unprecedented in human
history - one which crushed a malevolent fascism at the heart of Europe,
and in doing so laid some of the foundations of the world wc know today.
[Much of the global community we see around us was formed]{.underline},
fairly [recently]{.underline}, [by **collective revolutionary
projects**]{.underline} - projects which were [launched often enough by
the weak and hungry, but which nevertheless proved **successful** in
dislodging their **predatory foreign rulers**]{.underline}. Indeed, the
Western empires which those revolutions dismantled were themselves for
the most part the product of revolutions. [It is just that they were
those most victorious revolutions of all -]{.underline} the ones which
we have forgotten ever took place. [And that usually means the ones
which produced the likes of us. Other people's revolutions are always
more eye-catching than one's own]{.underline}. But [it is one thing to
make a revolution, and another to sustain it.]{.underline} Indeed, for
the most eminent revolutionary leader of the twentieth century, what
brought some revolutions to birth in the first place was also what was
responsible for their ultimate downfall. Vladimir Lenin believed that it
was the very backwardness of Tsarist Russia which had helped to make the
Bolshevik revolution possible. Russia was a nation poor in the kind of
civic institutions which secure the loyalty of citizens to the state,
and thus help to stave off political insurrection. Its power was
centralized rather than diffuse, coercive rather than consensual: it was
concentrated in the state machine, so that to overthrow that was to
seize sovereignty at a stroke, But this very same poverty and
backwardness helped to scupper the revolution once it had been made. You
could not build socialism in an economic backwater, encircled by
stronger, politically hostile powers, among a mass of unskilled,
illiterate workers and peasants without traditions of social
organization and democratic self-government. The attempt to do so called
for the strong-armed measures of Stalinism, which ended up subverting
the very socialism it was trying to construct. 8 THE POLITICS OF AMNESIA
[Something of the same fate afflicted many of those nations who managed
in the twentieth century to free themselves from Western colonial
rule.]{.underline} in a tragic irony, [socialism proved least possible
where it was most necessary]{.underline}. Indeed, post[-colonial theory
first emerged in the wake of the failure of Third World nations to go it
alone.]{.underline} It marked the end of the era of Third World
revolutions, and the first glimmerings of what we now know as
globalization. In the I 9 50s and 60s, a series of liberation movements,
led by the nationalist middle classes, had thrown off their colonial
masters in the name of political sovereignty and economic independence.
[By harnessing the demands of an impoverished people to these goals, the
Third World elites could install themselves in power on the back of
popular discontent. Once]{.underline} [ensconced]{.underline} there,
they would need to engage in an ungainly balancing act between radical
pressures from below and global market forces from outside. Marxism, an
internationalist current to its core, lent its support to these
movements, respecting their demand for political autonomy and seeing in
them a grievous setback to world capitalism. But [many Marxists
harboured few illusions about the aspiring middle-class elites who
spearheaded these nationalist currents. Unlike the more sentimental
brands of post-colonialism]{.underline}, [most **Marxism did not assume
that 'Third World' meant good** **and 'First World' bad.**]{.underline}
[They insisted rather on a class-analysis of colonial and post-colonial
politics themselves]{.underline}. Isolated, [poverty-stricken and poor
in civic, liberal or democratic traditions,]{.underline} [some of these
regimes found themselves taking the Stalinist path into]{.underline}
crippling [isolation]{.underline}. Others had to acknowledge that they
could not go it alone - that political sovereignty had brought with it
no authentic economic self-government, and could never do so in a
West-dominated world. As the world capitalist crisis deepened from the
early 1970s onwards, and as a number of Third World nations sank further
into stagnation and corruption, the aggressive restructurings of a
Western capitalism fallen upon hard times finally put paid to illusions
of national-revolutionary independence. 'Third Worldism' accordingly
gave way to 'post-colonialism'. Edward Said's magisterial Orientalism,
published in 1978, marked this transition in intellectual terms, despite
its author's understandable reservations about much of the post-colonial
theory which was to follow in its wake. The book appeared at the
turning-point of the fortunes of the international left. [Given the
partial failure of national revolution]{.underline} in the so-called
Third World, [post-colonial theory was wary of all talk of
nationhood]{.underline}. Theorists who were either too young or too
obtuse to recall that nationalism had born in its time an astonishingly
effective anti-colonial force could find in it nothing but a benighted
chauvinism or ethnic supremacism. Instead, [much post-colonial thought
focused on the cosmopolitan dimensions of a world in which post-colonial
states were being sucked inexorably into the orbit of global
capital.]{.underline} In doing so, it reflected a genuine reality. But
[in rejecting the idea of nationhood, it also tended to jettison the
notion of class, which had been so closely bound up with the
revolutionary nation]{.underline}. Most of the new theorists were not
only 'post' colonialism, but 'post' the revolutionary impetus which had
given birth to the new nations in the first place. [If those
nation-states had partly failed, unable to get on terms with the
affluent capitalist world, then to look beyond the nation seemed to mean
looking beyond class as well - and this at a time when capitalism was
more powerful and predatory than ever]{.underline}. [It is true that the
revolutionary nationalists had in a sense looked beyond class
themselves. By rallying the national people, they could forge a spurious
unity out of conflicting class interests]{.underline}.

Culture and Politics, as well as a Soros Senior Justice Fellow, teaches
in the Liberal Studies program at New York University, interview with
Vincent Emanuele, writer, activist and radio journalist who lives and
works in the Rust Belt, "Climate Change, Militarism, Neoliberalism and
the State," May 17, 2015, http://ouleft.sp-mesolite.tilted.net/?p=1980)

You mention mutual aid and how it was overhyped by the left in the
aftermath of Katrina. I'm thinking of the same thing in the aftermath of
Hurricane Sandy. You've been critical of the left in the US for not
approaching and using the state apparatus when dealing with climate
change and other ecological issues. Can you talk about your critique of
the US left and why you think the state can, and should, be used in a
positive manner?¶ Just to be clear, I think it is absolutely heroic and
noble what activists have done. My critique is not of peoples' actions,
or of people; it's of a lack of sophistication, and I hold myself partly
accountable, as part of the US left, for our deficiencies. [With
Hurricane Sandy, the Occupy folks did some amazing stuff. Yet, at a
certain level, their actions became charity]{.underline}. People were
talking about how many meals they distributed. That's charity. [That
is]{.underline}, in many ways, [a neoliberal solution]{.underline}.
That's exactly what [[the capitalist system]{.mark} in the US [would
like]{.mark}]{.underline}: [US [citizens not demanding their government
redistribute wealth]{.mark} from the 1% to the 99%]{.underline}. **[The
[capitalists love to see people turn to each other]{.mark} for money and
aid]{.underline}**. Unwittingly, that's what the anarcho-liberal left
fell into.¶ [[This is]{.mark} partly [due]{.mark} a very American style
[of **anti-state rhetoric**]{.mark}]{.underline} that transcends left
and right. [[The state is not just prisons or the
military]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's also Head Start, quality public
education, the library, clean water, the EPA, the City University of New
York system -- a superb, affordable set of schools that turns out
top-notch, working-class students with the lowest debt burdens in the
country. There's a reason the right is attacking these institutions.
[Why does [the right hate the EPA and public
education]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[Because they don't want to]{.mark} pay
to [educate the working class]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} they don't want the
working class educated. They don't want to pay to [clean up
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that's what the EPA forces them to
do. **[[When the left embraces anarcho-liberal notions of]{.mark}
self-help and fantasies of [being outside]{.mark} of both
[government]{.mark} and the market, [it cuts itself off from important
democratic resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[The state should
be]{.mark} seen as [an arena of class struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶
[[When the left turns its back on]{.mark} the [social democratic
features]{.mark} of government]{.underline}, stops making demands of the
state, and fails to reshape government by using the government for
progressive ends, [[it risks playing]{.mark} into [the hand]{.mark}s [of
the right]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The central message of the American
right is that government is bad and must be limited. **This message is
used to justify austerity**]{.underline}. However, in most cases,
neoliberal austerity does not actually involve a reduction of
government. Typically, restructuring in the name of austerity is really
just a transformation of government, not a reduction of it.¶ Over the
last 35 years, the state has been profoundly transformed, but it has not
been reduced. The size of the government in the economy has not gone
down. [The state has become less redistributive, more
punitive]{.underline}. Instead of a robust program of
government-subsidized and public housing, we have the prison system.
Instead of well-funded public hospitals, we have profiteering private
hospitals funded by enormous amounts of public money. Instead of large
numbers of well-paid public workers, we have large budgets for private
firms that now subcontract tasks formerly conducted by the government.¶
[We need to defend the progressive work of government]{.underline},
which, for me, means immediately defending public education. To be
clear, I do not mean merely vote or ask nicely, I mean [[movements
should attack government]{.mark} and government officials]{.underline},
target them with protests, [make their lives impossible [until they
comply]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was done very well with the FCC. And
my hat goes off to the activists who saved the internet for us. [The
left should be thinking about]{.underline} the [ways]{.underline} in
which [it can leverage government]{.underline}.¶ [The utility of
government was very apparent in Vermont during the aftermath of
Hurricane Irene. The rains from that storm destroyed or damaged over a
hundred bridges, many miles of road and rail, and swept away
houses.]{.underline} Thirteen towns were totally stranded. There was a
lot of incredible mutual aid; people just started clearing debris and
helping each other out. But within all this, town government was a
crucial connective tissue.¶ Due to the tradition of New England town
meeting, people are quite involved with their local government.
Anarchists should love town meetings. It is no coincidence that Murray
Bookchin spent much of his life in Vermont. Town meetings are a form of
participatory budgeting without the lefty rigmarole. More importantly,
the state government managed to get a huge amount of support from the
federal government. The state in turn pushed this down to the town
level. [Without that federal aid, Vermont would still be in
ruins]{.underline}. Vermont is not a big enough political entity to
shake down General Electric, a huge employer in Vermont. [The Vermont
government can't pressure GE to pay for the rebuilding of local
infrastructure]{.underline}, but the federal government can.¶ [Vermont
would still be a disaster if it didn't get a transfer of funds and
materials from the federal government.]{.underline} Similarly in New
York City, the public sector does not get enough praise for the many
things it did well after super storm Sandy. Huge parts of the subway
system were flooded, yet it was all up and running within the month.¶ As
an aside, one of the dirty little secrets about the Vermont economy is
that it's heavily tied-up with the military industrial complex. People
think Vermont is all about farming and boutique food processing. Vermont
has a pretty diverse economy, but agriculture plays a much smaller role
than you might think, about 2 percent of employment. Meanwhile, the
state's industrial sector, along with the government, is one of the top
employers, at about 13 percent of all employment. Most of this work is
in what's called precision manufacturing, making stuff like: high
performance nozzles, switches, calibrators, and stuff like the lenses
used in satellites, or handcrafting the blades that go in GE jet
engines. But I digress ... [[As we enter]{.mark} the crisis of [climate
change, it's important to be aware of]{.mark} the **actually [existing
legal]{.mark} and institutional [mechanisms]{.mark}** [with which we
can]{.mark} [contain]{.mark} and control [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶
I often joke with my anarchist and libertarian friends and ask if their
mutual-aid collectives can run Chicago's sanitation system or operate
satellites. Of course, on one level, I'm joking, but on another level,
I'm being quite serious. I [don't think activists on the left properly
understand the complexity of modern society. A simple example would be
how much sewage is produced in a single day in a country with 330
million people]{.underline}. How do people expect to manage these
day-to-day issues? In your opinion, is there a lack of sophistication on
the left in terms of what, exactly, the state does and how it functions
in our day-to-day lives?¶ It's sobering to reflect on just how complex
the physical systems of modern society are. And though it is very
unpopular to say among most American activists, [[it is important to
think about]{.mark} the hierarchies and [bureaucracies that are]{.mark}
necessarily [part of]{.mark} technologically [complex
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. A friend of mine is a water engineer in
Detroit, and he was talking to me about exactly what you're mentioning.
[The sewer system in Detroit is mind-bogglingly enormous and also very
dilapidated and very expensive. To not have infrastructure publicly
maintained, even though the capitalist class might not admit this, would
ultimately undermine capital accumulation]{.underline}.¶ You asked if
there is a lack of sophistication. Look, I'm trying to make helpful
criticisms to my comrades on the left, particularly to activists who
work so hard and valiantly. I've criticized divestment as a strategy,
yet I support it. I criticized the false claims that divesting fossil
fuels stocks would hurt fossil fuel companies. The fossil fuel
divestment movement started out making that claim. To its credit, the
movement has stopped making such claims. Now, they say that it will
remove the industries \"social license,\" which is a problematic concept
that comes from the odious world of \"corporate social responsibility.\"
However, now, [[students]{.underline}]{.mark} are becoming politicized,
and that's always great news.¶ For several years, some of us have been
trying to get climate activists, the climate left, to take the EPA and
the Clean Air Act seriously. The EPA has the power to actually
de-carbonize the economy. The divestment logic is: Schools will divest,
then fossil fuel companies will be held in greater contempt than they
are now? Honestly, they're already hated by everybody. That does what?
That creates the political pressure to stop polluting? We already have
those regulations: the Clean Air Act. There was a Supreme Court Case,
Massachusetts v. EPA, that was ruled on in 2007. It said the EPA must
regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Lots of professional activists in the
climate movement, at least up until very recently, have been totally
unaware of this.¶ Consequently, [they [are not making demands of the
EPA]{.mark}. They are not making demands of their various]{.underline}
local, state and federal [environmental agencies. These entities should
be enforcing the laws. They have the power. It's not because the people
in the climate movement are bad people or unintelligent]{.underline}.
They're dedicated and extremely smart. [**[It's because there's an
anti-state ethos]{.mark}** within the environmental movement
[and]{.mark} a [romanticization of the local]{.mark}.]{.underline} On a
side note, I don't think [all of [this]{.mark} stuff about local
economies]{.underline} is helpful. Sometimes I think this sort of
thinking [[doesn't recognize how]{.mark} the [global political economy
works]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The comrades at Jacobin magazine
have called this anarcho-liberalism. I think that is a great way to
describe [the dominant ideology of US left]{.underline}, which is both
anarchist and liberal in its sensibilities. This ideology [is
fundamentally about [ignoring government]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[instead]{.underline}, being [obsessed with]{.underline} scale, size,
and, by extension, [authenticity]{.underline}. [Big things are bad.
Small things are good. Planning is bad. Spontaneity is good. It is as
insidious as it is ridiculous. But it [is the **dominant worldview**
among the US left]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Do you really think that this
is the best way to approach the industry, through mobilizing state
resources?¶ Look, [[the fossil fuel industry is the most powerful force
the world has ever seen]{.underline}]{.mark}. Be honest, [[what]{.mark}
institution [could]{.mark} possibly ~~stand up to~~ [rebuff them? The
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. That doesn't mean it will. Right now,
government is captured by these corporate entities. But, it has, at
least in theory, an obligation to the people. And [it]{.underline} also
[has the laws that we need to wipe out the fossil fuel industrial
complex]{.underline}. This sounds fantastical and nuts, but I don't
think it is. I've been harping on this in articles and a little bit at
the end of Tropic of Chaos. According to the Center for Biological
Diversity, Nixon-era laws can be used to sue developers, polluters, etc.
You might not be able to stop them, but you can slow them down. The
[Clean Air Act basically says that if science can show that smoke-stack
pollution is harmful to human health, it has to be
regulated]{.underline}.¶ [If there was a movement really pushing the
government]{.underline}, and making the argument that the only safe
level of CO2 emissions is essentially zero ... [We have the laws in
place. We have the enabling legislation to shut down the fossil fuel
industry. [We should **use**]{.mark} **the [government to]{.mark}**
[levy astronomical fines]{.mark} on the fossil fuel companies for
pollution]{.underline}. And we should impose them at such a level that
it would undermine their ability to remain competitive and profitable.¶
Part Two:¶ Vincent Emanuele: Much of the green washing, or capitalism's
attempt to brand itself as green, focuses on localism and
anti-government, market-driven programs. Do you think this phobia of the
state among the US left is a result of previous failed political
experiments? How much of this ideology is imposed from outside forces?¶
Christian Parenti: Some state phobia comes from the American political
mythology of rugged individualism; some comes from the fundamentally
Southern, Jeffersonian tradition of states' rights. Fear of the federal
government by Southern elites goes back to the founding of the country.
The Hamiltonian versus Jeffersonian positions on government are
fundamental to understanding American politics. I wrote about this for
Jacobin magazine in a piece called \"Reading Hamilton from the Left.\"¶
Lurking just beneath the surface of states' rights is, of course,
plantation rights. Those plantations, places like Monticello, were
America's equivalent of feudal manors where, in a de facto sense,
economic, legal and military power were all bound up together and
located in the private household of the planter. Those Virginian
planters were the original localistas.¶ Nor did that project end with
the fall of slavery, or the end of de jure segregation in the 1960s.
Southern elites didn't want Yankees telling them what to do; how to
treat their slaves, how to organize their towns, how to run their
elections, how to treat the environment -- none of that! The South is a
resource colony and its regional elites, some of them now running
multinational corporations and holding important posts in the US
government, believe they have a right to do what they wish with the
people and landscape. Historically, that's a large part of what localism
and local democracy meant in the South. It meant that White local elites
were \"free\" -- free to push Black people around, free to feed racist
fantasies to the White working class. They didn't want interference from
the outside. So, some of that anti-statist ideology comes from that
plantation tradition. Another part of it comes from the real failures
and crimes of state socialism, though state socialism also had, and in
Cuba still has, many successes. The social welfare record of what we
used to call \"actually existing socialism\" was pretty impressive. But
there were also the problems of repression, surveillance and
bureaucratization, which were partly the result of capitalist
encirclement, partly the result of the ideological hubris rooted in
ideological overconfidence in the allegedly scientific power of Marxism,
partly the result of simple corruption among socialism's political
class. These real problems were central themes in the Cold War West's
educational and ideological apparatus of (generally right-wing)
messaging from the press and the political class. In this discourse,
communism was the state, while freedom was the private sector. Thus, the
United States and freedom became embodied in popular notions of the
private sector and individualism.¶ Of course, the great, unmentioned
contradiction in this self-fantasy is the fact that American capitalism
has always been heavily, heavily dependent on the state. Modern society,
despite its fantasies about itself, is intensely cooperative and
collective. Look at how complex its physical systems are; that cannot be
achieved without massive levels of coordination and collective
cooperation, much of it provided by the rules and regulations of
government. The knee-jerk [anti-statism]{.underline}, what the folks at
Jacobin call \"anarcho-liberalism,\" [is]{.underline} also [rooted in
experience. The less social power you have, the more the state is
experienced as an invasive, demeaning, oppressive and potentially, very
violent bureaucracy]{.underline}. Neoliberalism would not have gotten
this far if there wasn't an element of truth to this critique of its
bureaucracy and regulation. It has also used ideas that have old
cultural tractions, like freedom.¶ [Such are the [contradictions of
the]{.mark} modern]{.underline} democratic [[state]{.underline}]{.mark}
in capitalist society. [Government]{.underline} is rational, supportive,
humane, \[and [offers]{.underline}\] [redistribution]{.underline} in the
form of Social Security, [high-quality public schools, environmental
regulation, the Voting Rights Act and other federal civil rights laws
that have helped break hegemonic power of local and regional
bigots]{.underline}. [But government is also militarized policing, the
bloated prison system, spying on a vast scale]{.underline}; it is child
protective services taking children from loving mothers on the basis of
bureaucratic traps, corrupt corporate welfare at every level from town
government to federal military contracting. The racist, sexist,
plutocratic and techno-bureaucratic features of the state create fertile
ground for people to turn their backs on the whole idea of government.
What has been the impact of the right's ability to effectively
propagandize the White working class in the US?¶ Rightist intellectuals,
academics, journalists, media tycoons, university presidents and
loudmouth politicians work diligently to capture and form the raw
experience of everyday oppression into an ideological common sense. To
be clear, I use that term in the Gramscian sense, in which common sense
refers to ruling class ideology that is so hegemonic as to be absorbed
and naturalized by the people. The constant libertarian assault on the
radio, in newspapers, on the television, [this drumbeat of
anti-government discourse [is an old story]{.mark}]{.underline} -- but
still very important for understanding the anarcho-liberal sensibility.
Just tune in to AM radio late on a weekday evening and listen to the
anti-government vitriol. It's sort of wild.¶ Someone could do an
interesting study, Ph.D., in unpacking the cultural history of all this.
It is tempting to speculate that deindustrialization, having
disempowered and made anxious many huge sections of the working class,
opens the way for fantasies of empowerment. [The
[anti-statist]{.mark}]{.underline}, rugged individualist [[common sense
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also always simultaneously [[a fantasy of
empowerment]{.underline}]{.mark}. White men are particularly vulnerable
to these fantasies. The classic guy who calls into the batshit crazy,
late night, right-wing talk radio show is a middle-aged White man.
Listen closely to the rage and you hear fantasies of independence. In
this rhetoric, guns and gun rights become an obviously phallic symbol of
individual empowerment, agency, self worth, responsibility etc. But most
importantly, we have to think about how all of this anti-state ideology
is being stirred up with investments from elites. [[The neoliberal
project is]{.mark} to transform the state through [anti-statist
rhetoric]{.mark} and narratives. [They sell the idea that people need to
be liberated]{.mark} from the state. But then push policies that
imprison people while liberating and pampering capital. It is hard for
the left to see itself in this sketch]{.underline} -- the angry,
beaten-down, middle-aged White guy calling in from his basement or
garage. But I think these much-documented corporate efforts to build
neoliberal consent permeate the entire culture and infect us all, if
even just a little bit.¶ [This is the intellectually toxic environment
in which young activists are approaching the question of the climate
emergency. Young activists should be approaching the climate crisis the
way the left approached the economic crisis during the Great Depression.
[We need to]{.mark}]{.underline} drastically **[[restructure the
state.]{.mark} We need it mobilized]{.underline}** and able to transform
the economy. The New Deal was imperfect, of course. It left domestic
workers and farm workers out of the Fair Labor Standards Act. It was
inherently racist. It dammed rivers and was environmentally destructive.
However, the New Deal was radical in its general empowerment of labor;
its distributional outcomes were progressive and it achieved a
modernizing transformation of American capitalism. Not to overstate the
case, but [the New Deal could be a reference point for thinking about
the beginning of a green transformation that seeks to euthanize the
fossil fuel industry]{.underline}. We have to precipitously reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and build a new power sector. That much is very
clear.¶ However, let me be clear: Shutting down the fossil fuel industry
-- mitigating the climate crisis -- is not a solution for the
environmental crisis. Climate change is only one part of the
multifaceted environmental crisis. Shutting down the fossil fuel
industry would not automatically end overfishing, deforestation, soil
erosion, habitat loss, toxification of the environment etc. But carbon
mitigation is the most immediately pressing issue we face. The science
is very clear on this. Climate change is the portion of the overall
crisis that must be solved immediately so as to buy time to deal with
all the other aspects of the crisis. Because I take the political
implications of climate science very seriously, I am something of a
carbon fundamentalist.

"Sadistic Capitalism: Six Urgent Matters for Humanity in Global Crisis,"
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/35596-sadistic-capitalism-six-urgent-matters-for-humanity-in-global-crisis)

In these mean streets of globalized capitalism in crisis, it has become
profitable to turn poverty and inequality into a tourist attraction. The
South African Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa company has made a glamorized
spectacle of it. The resort recently advertised an opportunity for
tourists to stay \"in our unique Shanty Town \... and experience
traditional township living within a safe private game reserve
environment.\" A cluster of simulated shanties outside of Bloemfontein
that the company has constructed \"is ideal for team building, braais,
bachelors \[parties\], theme parties and an experience of a lifetime,\"
read the ad. The luxury accommodations, made to appear from the outside
as shacks, featured paraffin lamps, candles, a battery-operated radio,
an outside toilet, a drum and fireplace for cooking, as well as
under-floor heating, air conditioning and wireless internet access. A
well-dressed, young white couple is pictured embracing in a field with
the corrugated tin shanties in the background. The only thing missing in
this fantasy world of sanitized space and glamorized poverty was the
people themselves living in poverty. The \"luxury shanty town\" in South
Africa is a fitting metaphor for global capitalism as a whole. [Faced
with a **stagnant global economy**, [elites have managed to turn
**war**, **structural violence** and **inequality** into]{.mark}
opportunities for [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, pleasure and
entertainment. It is hard not to conclude that [unchecked capitalism has
become]{.underline} what I term \"[sadistic]{.underline} capitalism,\"
in which the suffering and deprivation generated by capitalism become a
source of aesthetic pleasure, leisure and entertainment for others. I
recently had the opportunity to travel through several countries in
Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia and throughout
North America. I was on sabbatical to research what the global crisis
looks like on the ground around the world. Everywhere I went, [social
polarization and political tensions have reached explosive
dimensions]{.underline}. Where is the crisis headed, what are the
possible outcomes and what does it tell us about global capitalism and
resistance? [[This crisis]{.mark} is **not like earlier structural
crises** of world capitalism, such as in the 1930s or 1970s. This one
[is]{.mark} fast becoming **[systemic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The crisis
of humanity shares aspects of earlier structural crises of world
capitalism, but [there are six novel, interrelated dimensions to the
current moment]{.underline} that I highlight here, in broad strokes, as
the \"big picture\" context in which countries and peoples around the
world are experiencing a descent into chaos and uncertainty. [1) The
level of **global social [polarization and inequality]{.mark}** [is
unprecedented]{.mark} in the face of out-of-control, over-accumulated
capital]{.underline}. In January 2016, the development agency Oxfam
published a follow-up to its report on global inequality that had been
released the previous year. According to the new report, now just [62
billionaires]{.underline} \-- down from 80 identified by the agency in
its January 2015 report \-- [control as much wealth as one half of the
world\'s population, and [the top 1% owns more wealth than the other 99%
combined]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beyond the transnational capitalist class
and the upper echelons of the global power bloc, [the richest 20 percent
of humanity owns some 95 percent of the world\'s wealth, while the
bottom 80 percent has to make do with just 5 percent. This]{.underline}
20-80 divide of global society into haves and the have-nots is the [[new
**global**]{.mark} **social [apartheid]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is
evident not just between rich and poor countries, but within each
country]{.underline}, North and South, [with]{.underline} the rise of
new affluent high-consumption sectors alongside the [downward mobility,
\"precariatization,\" destabilization and expulsion]{.underline} of
majorities. [[**Escalating inequalities** fuel]{.mark} capitalism\'s
chronic problem of **[over-accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The
transnational capitalist class cannot find productive outlets to unload
the enormous amounts of surplus it has accumulated, [leading to
**stagnation in the world economy**. The signs of an **impending
depression** are everywhere]{.underline}. The front page of the February
20 issue of The Economist read, \"The World Economy: Out of Ammo?\"
[Extreme levels of social polarization present a challenge to dominant
groups]{.underline}. They strive to purchase the loyalty of that 20
percent, while at the same time dividing the 80 percent, co-opting some
into a hegemonic bloc and repressing the rest. Alongside the spread of
frightening new systems of social control and repression is heightened
dissemination through the culture industries and corporate marketing
strategies that depoliticize through consumerist fantasies and the
manipulation of desire. [As \"Trumpism\"]{.underline} in the United
States so well [illustrates, a]{.underline}nother [strategy of
co-optation is the manipulation of [fear]{.mark} and insecurity among
the downwardly mobile so]{.underline} that [social anxiety [is channeled
toward **scapegoated communities**]{.mark}. This psychosocial mechanism
of displacing **mass anxieties**]{.underline} is not new, but it
[appears to be increasing around the world in the face of the structural
destabilization of capitalist globalization. Scapegoated communities are
under siege]{.underline}, such as the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Muslim
minority in India, the Kurds in Turkey, southern African immigrants in
South Africa, and Syrian and Iraqi refugees and other immigrants in
Europe. As with its 20th century predecessor, [**21st century fascism**
hinges on such manipulation of social anxiety at a time of acute
capitalist crisis. Extreme inequality requires extreme violence and
repression that lend to projects of 21st century fascism. 2) The [system
is]{.mark} fast [reaching]{.mark} the **ecological limits** to its
reproduction. We have reached several tipping points in]{.underline}
what environmental scientists refer to as [nine crucial \"[planetary
boundaries]{.mark}.\" We have already exceeded]{.underline} these
[boundaries [in]{.mark}]{.underline} three areas \-- [[**climate
change**, the **nitrogen cycle** and **diversity
loss**]{.underline}]{.mark}. There have been five previous mass
extinctions in earth\'s history. While all these were due to natural
causes, for the first time ever, human conduct is intersecting with and
fundamentally altering the earth system. We have entered what Paul
Crutzen, the Dutch environmental scientist and Nobel Prize winner,
termed the Anthropocene \-- a new age in which humans have transformed
up to half of the world\'s surface. We are altering the composition of
the atmosphere and **[[acidifying the oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}** at a
rate that **[[undermines the conditions for life]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The ecological dimensions of global crisis cannot be understated. \"We
are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will
remain open and which will forever be closed,\" observes Elizabeth
Kolbert in her best seller, The Sixth Extinction. \"No other creature
has ever managed this \... The Sixth Extinction will continue to
determine the course of life long after everything people have written
and painted and built has been ground into dust.\" Capitalism cannot be
held solely responsible. The human-nature contradiction has deep roots
in civilization itself. The ancient Sumerian empires, for example,
collapsed after the population over-salinated their crop soil. The Mayan
city-state network collapsed about AD 900 due to deforestation. And the
former Soviet Union wrecked havoc on the environment. However, [given
capital\'s implacable impulse to accumulate profit and its accelerated
commodification of nature, it is difficult to imagine that the
environmental catastrophe can be resolved within the capitalist system.
\"Green capitalism\" appears as an oxymoron]{.underline}, as sadistic
capitalism\'s attempt to turn the ecological crisis into a profit-making
opportunity, along with the conversion of poverty into a tourist
attraction. [3) The sheer magnitude of the means of violence is
unprecedented]{.underline}, as is the concentrated control over the
means of global communications and the production and circulation of
knowledge, symbols and images. We have seen the spread of frightening
[new systems of [social control]{.mark} and repression]{.underline} that
have [[brought]{.mark} us into]{.underline} the [[panoptical
**surveillance**]{.mark} society and]{.underline} the age of **[thought
control]{.underline}**. This real-life Orwellian world is in a sense
more perturbing than that described by George Orwell in his iconic novel
1984. In that fictional world, people were compelled to give their
obedience to the state (\"Big Brother\") in exchange for a quiet
existence with guarantees of employment, housing and other social
necessities. Now, however, the corporate and political powers that be
force obedience even as the means of survival are denied to the vast
majority. Global apartheid involves the creation of \"green zones\" that
are cordoned off in each locale around the world where elites are
insulated through new systems of spatial reorganization, social control
and policing. \"Green zone\" refers to the nearly impenetrable area in
central Baghdad that US occupation forces established in the wake of the
2003 invasion of Iraq. The command center of the occupation and select
Iraqi elite inside that green zone were protected from the violence and
chaos that engulfed the country. Urban areas around the world are now
green zoned through [gentrification, gated communities, surveillance
systems, and state and private violence]{.underline}. Inside the
world\'s green zones, privileged strata avail themselves of privatized
social services, consumption and entertainment. They can work and
communicate through internet and satellite sealed off under the
protection of armies of soldiers, police and private security forces.
Green zoning takes on distinct forms in each locality. In Palestine, I
witnessed such zoning in the form of Israeli military checkpoints,
Jewish settler-only roads and the apartheid wall. In Mexico City, the
most exclusive residential areas in the upscale Santa Fe District are
accessible only by helicopter and private gated roads. In Johannesburg,
a surreal drive through the exclusive Sandton City area reveals rows of
mansions that appear as military compounds, with private armed towers
and electrical and barbed-wire fences. In Cairo, I toured satellite
cities ringing the impoverished center and inner suburbs where the
country\'s elite could live out their aspirations and fantasies. They
sport gated residential complexes with spotless green lawns, private
leisure and shopping centers and English-language international schools
under the protection of military checkpoints and private security
police. In other cities, green zoning is subtler but no less effective.
In Los Angeles, where I live, the freeway system now has an express lane
reserved for those that can pay an exorbitant toll. On this lane, the
privileged speed by, while the rest remain one lane over, stuck in the
city\'s notorious bumper-to-bumper traffic \-- or even worse, in
notoriously underfunded and underdeveloped public transportation, where
it may take half a day to get to and from work. There is no barrier
separating this express lane from the others. However, a near-invisible
closed surveillance system monitors every movement. If a vehicle without
authorization shifts into the exclusive lane, it is instantly recorded
by this surveillance system and a heavy fine is imposed on the driver,
under threat of impoundment, while freeway police patrols are
ubiquitous. Outside of the global green zones, [warfare and police
containment have become normalized and sanitized]{.underline} for those
not directly at the receiving end of armed aggression. \"Militainment\"
\-- portraying and even [**glamorizing war and violence** as
entertaining spectacles]{.underline} through Hollywood films and
television police shows, computer games and corporate \"news\" channels
\-- may be the epitome of sadistic capitalism. It [desensitizes,
bringing about complacency and indifference]{.underline}. In between the
green zones and outright warfare are [prison industrial complexes,
immigrant and refugee repression and control systems, the
criminalization of outcast communities and capitalist
schooling]{.underline}. The omnipresent media and cultural apparatuses
of the corporate economy, in particular, aim to [colonize the mind \--
to undermine the ability to think critically and outside the dominant
worldview. A [neofascist culture emerges through **militarism**]{.mark},
extreme [**masculinization**, **racism**]{.mark} and **racist
mobilizations against scapegoats**]{.underline}. [4) **We are reaching
limits to the extensive expansion of capitalism**]{.underline}.
Capitalism is like riding a bicycle: When you stop pedaling the bicycle,
you fall over. [If the capitalist system stops expanding]{.underline}
outward, [it enters crisis and faces collapse. In each earlier
structural crisis, the system went through a new round of extensive
expansion \-- from]{.underline} waves of [colonial conquest]{.underline}
in earlier centuries, [to the integration]{.underline} in the late 20th
and early 21st centuries [of the]{.underline} former [socialist
countries]{.underline}, China, India and other areas that had been
marginally outside the system. [There are no longer any new territories
to integrate into world capitalism]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
privatization of education, health care, utilities, basic services and
public land are turning those spaces in global society that were outside
of capital\'s control into \"spaces of capital.\" Even poverty has been
turned into a commodity. What is there left to commodify? Where can the
system now expand? [[With the limits]{.mark} to expansion [comes]{.mark}
a turn toward **[militarized accumulation]{.mark}** \-- [making **wars
of endless destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline} and reconstruction [and
expanding the **militarization of social and political institutions** so
as to continue to generate **new opportunities for accumulation** in the
face of stagnation. 5) There is the rise of a **vast surplus
population**]{.underline} inhabiting a \"planet of slums,\" [alienated
from the productive economy]{.underline}, thrown into the margins and
subject to these sophisticated systems of social control and
destruction. [Global [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} has no direct use
for surplus humanity. But indirectly, it holds wages down everywhere and
[[makes new systems of]{.mark} **21st century [slavery]{.mark}**
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. These systems include **[[prison
labor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the forced recruitment of miners at
gunpoint by warlords contracted by global corporations to dig up
valuable minerals in the Congo, [[**sweatshops** and exploited
**immigrant communities**]{.underline}]{.mark} (including the rising
tide of immigrant female caregivers for affluent populations).
Furthermore, the global working class is experiencing [accelerated
\"precariatization.\"]{.underline} The \"new precariat\" [refers
to]{.underline} the proletariat that faces capital under today\'s
unstable and precarious labor relations \-- [informalization,
casualization, part-time, temp, immigrant and contract
labor]{.underline}. As communities are uprooted everywhere, there is [a
rising reserve army of immigrant labor]{.underline}. The global working
class is becoming divided into citizen and immigrant workers. The latter
[are]{.underline} particularly attractive to transnational capital, as
the lack of citizenship rights makes them [particularly vulnerable, and
therefore, exploitable]{.underline}. The challenge for dominant groups
is how to contain the real and potential rebellion of surplus humanity,
the immigrant workforce and the precariat. [How can they contain the
explosive contradictions of this system?]{.underline} The 21st century
megacities become the battlegrounds between mass resistance movements
and the new systems of mass repression. Some
[[populations]{.underline}]{.mark} in these cities (and also in
abandoned countryside) [[are at risk of
**genocide**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as those in Gaza, zones in
Somalia and Congo, and swaths of Iraq and Syria. 6) There is a
disjuncture between a globalizing economy and a nation-state-based
system of political authority. Transnational state apparatuses are
incipient and do not wield enough power and authority to organize and
stabilize the system, much less to impose regulations on runaway
transnational capital. In the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, for
instance, the governments of the G-8 and G-20 were unable to impose
transnational regulation on the global financial system, despite a
series of emergency summits to discuss such regulation. Elites
historically have attempted to resolve the problems of over-accumulation
by state policies that can regulate the anarchy of the market. However,
in recent decades, transnational capital has broken free from the
constraints imposed by the nation-state. The more \"enlightened\" elite
representatives of the transnational capitalist class are now clamoring
for transnational mechanisms of regulation that would allow the global
ruling class to reign in the anarchy of the system in the interests of
saving global capitalism from itself and from radical challenges from
below. At the same time, the division of the world into some 200
competing nation-states is not the most propitious of circumstances for
the global working class. Victories in popular struggles from below in
any one country or region can (and often do) become diverted and even
undone by the structural power of transnational capital and the direct
political and military domination that this structural power affords the
dominant groups. In Greece, for instance, the leftist Syriza party came
to power in 2015 on the heels of militant worker struggles and a mass
uprising. But the party abandoned its radical program as a result of the
enormous pressure exerted on it from the European Central Bank and
private international creditors. The Systemic Critique of Global
Capitalism A growing number of transnational elites themselves now
recognize that [any resolution to the global crisis must involve
redistribution]{.underline} downward of income. [However]{.underline},
in the viewpoint of those from below, a [**neo-Keynesian
redistribution** within the prevailing corporate power structure is not
enough. What is required is a]{.underline} redistribution of power
downward and [transformation toward a system in which social need trumps
private profit. **A [global rebellion]{.mark} against the transnational
capitalist class [has spread]{.mark}** since the financial collapse of
2008. Wherever one looks, there is popular, grassroots and leftist
struggle]{.underline}, and the rise of new cultures of resistance: [the
Arab Spring; the resurgence of leftist politics in Greece, Spain and
elsewhere in Europe; the tenacious resistance of Mexican social
movements following the Ayotzinapa massacre of 2014; the favela uprising
in Brazil against the government\'s World Cup and Olympic expulsion
policies; the student strikes in Chile; the remarkable surge in the
Chinese workers\' movement; the shack dwellers and other poor people\'s
campaigns in South Africa; Occupy Wall Street, the immigrant rights
movement, Black Lives Matter, fast food workers\' struggle and the
mobilization around the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in the
United States. This global revolt is spread unevenly and faces many
challenges]{.underline}. A number of these struggles, moreover, have
suffered setbacks, such as the Greek working-class movement and,
tragically, the Arab Spring. What type of a transformation is viable,
and how do we achieve it? [How we interpret the global crisis is itself
a matter of vital importance as politics polarize worldwide between a
neofascist and a popular response. [The]{.mark} systemic [critique
of]{.mark} global [capitalism must]{.mark} strive to [influence]{.mark},
from this vantage point, [the]{.mark} discourse and [practice of
movements]{.mark} for a more just distribution of wealth and power.
**[Our survival may depend on it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### 1NC \-- Alt \-- Communist Party

#### The alternative is to affirm the [model of the Communist Party]{.underline} -- only the Party can provide [effective accountability mechanisms]{.underline} to correct violent tendencies within organizing, educate and [mobilize marginalized communities]{.underline}, and connect local struggles to a movement for international liberation.

Century. September 2018.
<https://theforgenews.org/2018/09/21/party-organizing-in-the-21st-century.>

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that [the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda has been
extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this insight. By
building institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to
concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief
from the horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building
strategy recognizes that actually doing the work to serve the people
does infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular support than
electing democratic socialist candidates or holding endless political
education classes can ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that
we have something to offer the oppressed. The question, of course,
remains: once we have built a base of popular support, what do we do
next? [If it turns out that establishing socialist institutions to meet
people's needs does in fact create sympathy towards the cause of
communism, how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply:
**[[in order to mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we
need to have already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [It is not enough to simply meet peoples
needs. Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in the name
of communism.]{.underline} [We [**must refuse** **covert front
organizing and instead have** a public face as a communist
party]{.mark}.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve the
people programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it clear
that we are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and are
not content simply with establishing endless dual power organizations.
[We must be clear that our strategy is revolutionary and in order to
make this clear we must adopt party organizing. By "party organizing" I
mean an organizational strategy which adopts the party model. Such
organizing focuses on building a party whose membership is formally
unified around a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making.]{.underline} [The party model creates internal methods for
**holding party members accountable**, unifying party member action
around democratically determined goals, and for educating party members
in communist theory and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization
utilizing the party model works to build dual power institutions while
simultaneously educating the communities they hope to serve.
[Organizations which adopt the party model focus on propagandizing
around the need for revolutionary socialism. They function as the
forefront of political organizing, empowering local communities to
theorize their liberation through communist theory while organizing
communities to literally fight for their liberation.]{.underline} A
party is not simply a group of individuals doing work together, but is a
formal organization unified in its fight against capitalism. Party
organizing has much to offer the base building movement. By working in a
unified party, base builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to
and informed by a unified national and international strategy. While the
most horrific manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique
form at the local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is
against a material base which functions not only at the national but at
the international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[party organizing allows for
local organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for
their actions.]{.underline}** [It allows criticism to function not as
one independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather
as comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to
sharpen each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [**accountability is crucial**.]{.underline} [As
a movement which operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist
and colonial ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal
unity and party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas
allows us to address these consistent problems within American socialist
organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies the various
dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also allows for
base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into
the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The party model
creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in
a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with
newer organizers. It also allows community members who have been served
by dual power projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming
party members and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy. It ensures that there are formal processes for educating
communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act
and organize in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must
recognize that the current state of the base building movement precludes
the possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [[individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing]{.mark}. Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of community
members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment of armed
and militant party cadres capable of defending dual power institutions
from state terror.]{.underline} Dual power institutions must be unified
openly and transparently around these organizations in order for them to
operate as more than "red charities." Serving the people means meeting
their material needs while also educating and propagandizing. It means
radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The party model remains the
most useful method for achieving these ends.]{.underline} The use of the
party model by local organizations allows base builders to gain popular
support, and most importantly, to mobilize their base of popular support
towards revolutionary ends, not simply towards the construction of a
parallel economy which exists as an end in and of itself. [It is my hope
that we will see future unification of the various local base building
organizations into a national party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we
must push for party organizing at the local level. If local
organizations adopt party organizing, [it ought to become clear
that]{.underline} **[[a unified national party will have to be the long
term goal of the base building movement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many of
the already existing organizations within the base building movement
already operate according to these principles. I do not mean to suggest
otherwise. Rather, my hope is to suggest that we ought to be explicit
about the need for party organizing and emphasize the relationship
between dual power and the party model. Doing so will make it clear that
the base building movement is not pursuing a cooperative economy
alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a revolutionary socialist strategy
capable of fighting capitalism. The long term details of base building
and dual power organizing will arise organically in response to the
conditions the movement finds itself operating within. [I hope that I
have put forward a useful contribution to the discussion about base
building organizing, and have demonstrated the need for party organizing
in order to ensure that the base building tendency maintains a
revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer details of
revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are not a good
subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party organizing
offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will succeed. My
goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward but to open a
conversation about how the base building movement will organize as it
transitions from a loose network of individual organizations into a
unified socialist tendency. These discussions and debates will be
crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement can succeed.

#### The alternative is not simply a theoretical exercise but is informed by actual activism and community networks like ["Casa Publo's]{.underline}" in Puerto Rico or organizations [Asian Pacific Environmental Network]{.underline} in the U.S. or [Oil-Free Auckland]{.underline} lead by indigenous New Zealand communities such as [Maori]{.underline} and [Pasifika]{.underline} peoples. Only a truly [global anti-capitalist paradigm]{.underline} that is insurgent and community based can solve the modern ecocide of capitalism and genocidal violence. 

**De Onís 2018 (**"ES UNA LUCHA DOBLE" Articulating Environmental
Nationalism in Puerto Rico by Catalina Maíre De Onís Ph.D., Indiana

**[While linking environmentalism and nationalisms allows for important
recognitions about shared logics of domination that mark particular
bodies (humans, water, and land) as disposable]{.underline}**, and
**[assists in broadening the concept of self-determination beyond
political sovereignty]{.underline}**, these relationships are complex.
[For instance, in Puerto Rico, disputes over how much influence the
federal government should have in the Big Island's environmental
decision-making process have driven a wedge between pro-independence and
environmental activists]{.underline}. During [the 1970s, some movement
actors viewed US intervention as necessary for enacting and enforcing
environmental laws; others saw this as a betrayal of Puerto Rico's
potential for political sovereignty]{.underline}.46 Thus, as I have
argued elsewhere, **[coalitional politics must grapple with complex
movement histories, legacies, and tensions]{.underline}**.47
Furthermore, [**enactments of environmental nationalism with respect to
strategic eclipse may not always "delink," or divest from, oppressive
practices**.48 Thus, while environmental nationalism and strategic
eclipse can bring people together to create more livable communities,
this articulation also has the potential to alienate others and deny
vital interconnections.]{.underline}49 One of the **[ways I have tried
to record and complicate articulatory movement practices involves
engaging those on the front lines with a commitment to praxis. A
decolonial approach to reading these movement efforts requires
critically documenting the lived realities of community members,
including their reflections on mobilization campaigns and
outcomes]{.underline}**. This approach resonates with Karma Chávez's
contention that we should **[["think about the courses of action that
people have available to them,]{.mark} on the ground, [as the starting
points for theoretical analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**."50
**[[By]{.mark} accessing, [assessing,]{.mark} and amplifying [these
discourses,]{.mark} activist scholars and other researchers [can engage
in praxis that values both academic and community expertise and the
insights and imaginaries generated by these collaborations.]{.mark} A
study of the pipeline defeat would be incomplete without a discussion of
a negative outcome of Vía Verde's demise---a proposed alternative
"solution," known as the Aguirre Offshore Gasport.]{.underline}**
**[While the project is currently in limbo, the local public energy
utility, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the US
corporation Excelerate Energy are working to approve this gas port in
southern Puerto Rico]{.underline}**. According to Santiago, **[the
project will detrimentally affect fishers' livelihoods and coral reefs
and increase the territory's dependency on another fossil fuel
(liquefied gas).51 This [energy proposal demonstrates that grappling
with colliding economic, energy, and environmental crises]{.mark} also
[involves determining what counts as a "successful" campaign, and for
whom]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In response to the disproportionate effects
of energy colonialism experienced in the southern part of Puerto Rico,
local community members were organizing for solar communities before the
2017 hurricane season and continue to do so. While Casa Pueblo has
received attention for its commendable efforts to help distribute and
implement solar devices and infrastructure, other, less well-known
groups also are working hard in this area. For example, collaborators
with the Iniciativa de la Bahía de Jobos have been planning Coquí Solar,
a community solar project, for several years. Evincing the impure
politics of colonial situations, the Sierra Club likely will fund this
community project. Thus, despite the limitations of USbased
organizations in Puerto Rico noted by Rosario and González, this solar
project suggests that they can provide the financial resources necessary
to give community members control over their own energy futures.
**[Given our collective, though uneven, contribution to anthropogenic
climate disruption and environmental degradation, it is not hyperbolic
to argue that what happens in one part of the world carries global
effects. The relationship between environmental advocacy and
nationalisms is crucial for imagining and enacting more just,

### 1NC \-- Alt \-- Revolutionary Intercommunalism

**Vote neg to endorse a revolutionary intercommunalism praxis like the
BBP -- that analyzes the way in which racial capitalism has effected
communities and is rooted in materiality**

Toni **Morrison 09** (analyzes writings of Huey P. Newton),
\<\<QUALS\>\>, "To Die for the People: The Writings of Huey P. Newton,"
City Lights Books, 2009 //pk

[The vision of the Black Panther Party is expressed in the first part of
this book, and the core of the vision is Revolutionary Intercommunalism.
Revolutionary Intercommunalism is an idea which emerges out of a
fundamental contradiction: that America is not a nation but an empire
which directly or indirectly spans the globe, that its real units are
communities which are ever more visible as one goes down into the poor
Third World strata of America, and that that empire and community stand
in dialectical contradiction and confrontation with each
other.]{.underline} While peoples legitimately fight for nationhood
throughout the world, in a fundamental sense, nations cannot really
exist for long because all nations fall somewhere on a scale from
liberated to non-liberated territories. As Newton says of Cuba, The
People's Republic of China, North Korea, North Vietnam, The Provisional
Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, "they represent the people's
liberated territory." The American empire is everywhere, even in China,
a fact dramatically demonstrated by Nixon's visit. But the struggle
against that empire takes form in the growth of communities able to
produce, educate, and defend themselves. And the struggle expresses the
revolutionary process when these communities forge linkages among
themselves within nations and reach across national boundaries to
different national communities. The Third World in America can never
become a part of the American nation because there is no nation. To
become a part means joining the empire which for most Third World people
means to do so in a menial capacity. Third World people live in
communities not by choice but because they are forced to remain in
demarcated ghettos. Millions of White Americans live not in communities
but as atomized individuals and in households. Nothing is more natural
to man than xxxii to live in a community, but nothing is so abhorrent to
the doctrines of "freedom" of the empire than that man should live in a
community which escapes the manipulation of the rulers. The "villages"
of the world have much to teach its "cities." "We cannot make our stand
as nationalists," for the closer one is to the center of the empire, the
more illusory the idea of nationhood is for any people. "We cannot even
make our stand as internationalists," for an aggregate of citizens of
the world is little more than an aggregate of bourgeois individualists.
"We must place our hopes on the philosophy of intercommunalism"---only
those who are by, through, and from a community can serve the great
family of humankind. To go out, one must go deep. But to go deep, one
must also go out. "It is our belief," says Newton, "that the Black
people in America are the only people who can free the world, loosen the
yoke of colonialism, and destroy the war machine." The revolutionary
process shows that people will be liberated, that the liberation of the
outer and inner Third World is the key element in that process, and the
Black people of the empire's heartland are at the center of
revolutionary action. [The practice of the Black Panther Party is
expressed in the second part of this book. The Party is a revolutionary
vehicle made up of three elements: a small but dedicated cadre of
workers who are willing to devote their full time to the goals of the
organization; an organized structure through which the cadre can
function; and revolutionary concepts which define and interpret
phenomena, and establish the goals toward which the political vehicle
will work. This is one side of practice. Its other indispensable side is
"the building of a community structure," the development of basic
survival programs for the people amongst whom the Party lives and serves
and derives nourishment. The practice of the Black Panther Party is much
like the building of base areas which the Chinese Communists engaged
xxxiii in during the 1930s.]{.underline} Building base areas sounds
romantic with dashing guerrillas going out on forays against Japanese
and Kuomintang oppressors. In reality it involved hard work day after
day: planting crops, educating adults and children, organizing disaster
relief, tending the sick, talking with the people. But when the
oppressor came into the village, all united in defense of their
achievements. And when the time came to unite with distant villages and
party units for the attainment of larger goals, the cadres and many of
the people went forth. [They now understood that the large goals and the
small goals were inextricably bound together. But the cadres also
understood that the large goals were meaningless unless the smaller
goals could be attained. As Newton says, ". . . they have to see first
some basic accomplishments in order to realize that major successes are
possible."]{.underline} The writings of Huey Newton also make clear that
above all, the cadres and the people must know things as they are, and
not just find pleasure in celestial or revolutionary rhetoric. "[We
always emphasized a concrete analysis of conditions." Even when the
Black Panther Party was first founded, "its dreamers were armed with an
ideology which provided a systematic method of analysis of how best to
meet those needs." But concrete analysis must never be of the type done
by the sociological snooper who coldly collects and assorts his
data.]{.underline} "We are interested in everything the people are
interested in." [All great revolutions, despite what bourgeois theorists
with their elitist notions have written, have always succeeded where the
leaders and cadres were the "vehicles" of the people, where they were
able to translate into organized and effective action the things the

[This new phase of imperialism, Newton contended, would fundamentally
change the nature of the geography and of capitalist production and
consumption. The Second and Third World would increasingly become a site
of capitalist production, technology and forms of consumption, but with
an increased rate of super-exploitation]{.underline}. This centred on
Western based multinational corporations penetrating these regions in
order to create a global commodity and consumption chain. This
disarticulated form of Fordism3 would see 'advanced technologies
transplanted into these areas' but still under the control of Western
interests. The result would be a new global geography of industrial
production and the spreading of capitalist ideology that would eradicate
socialist alternatives to capitalist market societies: [The difference,
however, is everybody in America has a television, a car, and a
relatively decent place to live. Even the lowest of the low do not live
anywhere near the level of the poor of the world.]{.underline} Even the
average person, the average 'nigger,' in the United States does not live
as low as the average Chinese. Those who support the so-called socialist
states will begin to be swayed by the introduction of a U.S. consumer
market into their socialist countries.4 According to Newton, this
process would see 'growth without development' within the Second and
Third World and increased capital flows from the Second and Third World
Narayan 191 back into the First. A regime supported by self-enriching
'comprador agents' in nation states outside of the West would bow to the
power and ideology of empire and readily oppress and exploit their own
people in order to secure their own position and wealth (Newton, 2002:
302--303). [Such changes in the global capitalist production would,
Newton believed, have massive implications for First World populations
and especially US society. Newton argued that the nature of postwar
capitalism would be disrupted due to the effects of reactionary
intercommunalism's disarticulated Fordism and increased technological
advancement.]{.underline} Moreover, Newton outlined how technological
innovation (automation, robotics, cybernetics), combined with an
increasing global labour arbitrage, would eradicate the need for
expensive wageworkers in the First World. [This would see the 'increase
of the lumpen-proletariat and the decrease of the
proletariat']{.underline} and the likely dismantling of the welfare
state as ruling circles sought to maximize profits and their share of
income (Newton, 2002: 193). This 'increase of the lumpen proletariat and
the decrease of the proletariat' would [in turn disrupt the racial
settlement of US society. Whereas Black Americans had literally been
segregated from the fruits of US welfare capitalism]{.underline} (New
Deal), in [order for white society to flourish, reactionary
intercommunalism would transgress such racial privilege in order to
maintain and expand exploitative and profitable capitalist relations.
This would not end racial capitalism5 within the US, but rather see the
boomeranging of conditions and practices found in the darker nations of
the Third World]{.underline} (and ghettos of the US), such as
deindustrialization, structural unemployment, state retrenchment and
super-exploitation, back into the general (white) population of the US.
[Newton believed that this would heighten the racial divisions and
tensions in US society rather than lead to greater racial unity between
white and non-white communities]{.underline} (Newton, 2002: 193). Newton
concluded that this new phase of imperialism and the onset of a truly
global form of capitalism would result in all of the world's nation
states becoming interconnected and under siege by the ruling circle of
global capital and capitalist ideology (Newton, 2002: 170). This would,
in turn, reduce humanity to a collection of communities who, whilst
sharing different material and cultural experiences, were united by the
reality of the full spectrum dominance of capital: There is an
undeniable interconnection to everything among all the territories in
the world. That is why we say that there are no longer nations; there
are only communities under siege by the reactionaries. This is where we
get the term reactionary intercommunalism. (Newton, 2002: 259) As
Narayan (2017) has argued, [Newton's theorization of reactionary
intercommunalism is best read as a proto-theorization of what we have
come to call neo-liberal globalization.]{.underline} Newton's narration
of how the interests of corporate capital, technological advancement and
a new geography of industrial production would lead to
deindustrialization, precarious employment, welfare state retrenchment,
and an orgy of profit in the First World has essentially come to pass
(see Harvey, 2005); whilst his narrative of how socialism would be
defeated through Western neo-imperialism, elite enrichment and the
expansion of capitalist forms of production, consumption and
exploitation in the Third 192 Current Sociology Monograph 1 68(2) World
is also eerily prescient (see Prashad, 2013; Smith, 2016). What I want
to highlight in the next section is how [Newton's pivoting of the BPP
away from armed confrontation with the US state and towards the idea of
survival pending revolution was rooted in his theorization of
reactionary intercommunalism's possible negation through revolutionary
intercommunalism and the concept of creating 'liberated
territory'.]{.underline} Survival pending revolution: Saving and
organizing the people We stood at a crossroads. Would we follow our
original survival program and live -- if necessary die -- for the
people, or would we join our potential for nihilism with the State's
terrific violence and kill ourselves before the government could
exterminate us at their leisure? Rebuilding the organisation would be
the Black Panther Party's greatest challenge. (Newton, 1972c)
[Historians of the BPP have often downplayed the significance of
Newton's theory of intercommunalism on BPP praxis]{.underline}. In their
erudite history of the BPP, Bloom and Martin (2013: 354, 467--468, n11)
argue that Newton's evocation of intercommunalism did not mark a sharp
categorical shift in the Party's ideological history and its
anti-imperialist stance. They go on to suggest that the BPP's move
towards the idea of 'survival pending revolution' was driven by
pragmatic decisions in reaction to increased government repression,
falling support from white allies and middle class members of the Black
community, concessions given by the US state such as affirmative action
programs, the tapering down of the Vietnam War, and the soothing of US
diplomatic relations with the Third World. Murch (2010: 194) and Spencer
(2016: 222, n73) also question the significance of intercommunalism
through highlighting a perceived disconnect between Newton's theory and
the BPP's rank and file members. The argument here being that BPP
members were driven more by concrete ideas of community control than by
lofty and abstract ideas such as intercommunalism. On face value, these
assertions hold true. The BPP did have to react to an ever-changing
domestic and geo-political context and intercommunalism can be seen as
an evolution in BPP ideology. The praxis of the BPP rank and file was
also certainly not always consciously conducted in the name of Newton's
theory. Yet, these narratives seem to underplay how Newton's theory of
reactionary intercommunalism was actually formed in reaction to these
changing political contexts and readily accounts for developments such
as the cooling of diplomatic hostility between Third World and the US.
Above all else, these positions neglect the fact, as Elaine Brown (1992:
277) makes clear, that there was the ' "mass line", and there was the
"party line" and then there was the "bottom line", which was the vision
of Huey P. Newton'. Indeed, as Brown goes on to outline, the BPP's turn
towards the idea of 'survival pending revolution', and the expanding of
the BPP's survival programs, was inherently linked to Newton's
theorization of reactionary intercommunalism and its possible negation
through what he called 'revolutionary intercommunalism'.6 Newton's idea
of revolutionary intercommunalism was founded on the belief that
attempts to fight reactionary intercommunalism through forms of
nationalism or even internationalism were pointless. Newton asserted
that the economic, technological and political reality of reactionary
intercommunalism meant that nations could not reassert Narayan 193 their
former forms of sovereignty in order to practise nationalism or
internationalism (Newton, 2002: 187). The only solution to a situation
to such a 'distorted form of collectively', Newton contended, where the
'superstructure of Wall Street' appropriated the wealth that all global
communities of 'labour' produced, was to liberate all of the communities
of the world (Newton, 2002: 174, 236). Newton identified that the main
barriers to such revolutionary intercommunalism were the material and
ideological effects of reactionary intercommunalism. As we have seen,
reactionary intercommunalism now meant that all nation states and their
populations were becoming a 'collection of communities', with no
'superstructure of their own' other than global capitalism. Moreover,
the processes of reactionary intercommunalism, such as the spreading of
capitalist production and proletarianization in the Third World and the
lumpen-proletarianization and state retrenchment in the First World, now
led to the co-opting or destruction of the very socio-economic, cultural
and political institutions (education, workplace, unions, democracy,
nation state) that could facilitate revolutionary intercommunal
subjectivity amongst the world's peoples. However, [Newton highlighted
that there existed liberated territories in the global system of
reactionary intercommunalism, such as China, Cuba and North Vietnam,
which offered alternative ways of life to reactionary intercommunalism
and offered examples of a path towards revolutionary
intercommunalism:]{.underline} . . . [we say they represent the people's
liberated territory. They represent a community liberated. But that
community is not sufficient, it is not satisfied, just as the National
Liberation Front is not satisfied with the liberated territory in the
South. It is only the ground- work and preparation for the liberation of
the world . . . seizing the . . . wealth from the ruling circle, equal
distribution and proportional representation in an intercommunal
framework. This is what the Black Panther Party would like to achieve
with the help of the power of the people, because without the people
nothing can be achieved.]{.underline} (Newton, 2002: 171) It was within
this rationale of a 'liberated territory', which could forward the cause
of revolutionary intercommunalism, that Newton sought to expand and
accelerate the survival programs of the BPP in late 1970.7 [Newton's
theory of intercommunalism thus reconceptualized the survival programs
of the BPP as a means towards an anti-imperialist struggle for liberated
territory within the belly of US empire and found common cause with
anti-imperialist struggle for liberated territory in the Third
World]{.underline}.8 The revolutionary intercommunal vision of the BPP
survival programs post-1970 was made clear in Newton's 1971 declaration
of the BPP's common cause with the anti-imperial struggle of FRELIMO in
Mozambique: To achieve this end, we struggle here inside the United
States to get rid of our oppression. Others struggle inside their
territorial boundaries to get rid of oppression. [The more territory we
liberate in the world, the closer we will come to an end to all
oppression . . . Today the philosophy of revolutionary intercommunalism
dictates that the survival programs implemented by and with the people
here in America and those same basic People's Survival Programs being
implemented in Mozambique by the Mozambique Liberation Front are
essential to bringing about world unity]{.underline} . . . We are a
large collection of communities who can unite and fight together against
our common enemy. The United States' domination over all our territories
equals a 194 Current Sociology Monograph 1 68(2) reactionary (in
opposition to the interests of all) set of circumstances among our
communities: Reactionary Intercommunalism. We can transform these
circumstances to all our benefit: Revolutionary Intercommunalism.
(Newton, 2002: 236)9 Newton believed that BPP survival programs would
now function with a dual purpose. [Such programs would not only address
the basic needs of the Black community that had been racially excluded
from the spaces and spoils of US welfare capitalism and which would be
further marginalized by economic and political changes associated with
reactionary intercommunalism (lumpen-proletarianization, state
retrenchment, super-exploitation). But also serve as a 'necessary part
of the revolutionary process' by practically educating and politicizing
community members through their participation in alternative
institutional forms of community cooperation and collaboration. Survival
programs were therefore seen as a 'means of brining people closer to the
transformation of society' towards communist ends]{.underline} (Newton,
2009b \[1973\]: 357). [Newton dubbed the dual-purpose strategy of BPP
survival programs, which helped the community survive the material and
ideological effects of reactionary intercommunalism whilst also
educating and politicizing the community around revolutionary
intercommunalism]{.underline}, 'Survival Pending Revolution': [All these
programs satisfy the deep needs of the community but they are not
solutions to our problems. That is why we call them survival programs,
meaning survival pending revolution.]{.underline} We say that the
survival program of the Black Panther Party is like the survival kit of
a sailor stranded on a raft. It helps him to sustain himself until he
can get completely out of that situation. So the survival programs are
not answers or solutions, but [they will help us to organize the
community around a true analysis and understanding of their situation.
When consciousness and understanding is raised to a high level then the
community will seize the time and deliver themselves from the boot of
their oppressor.]{.underline} (Newton, 2002: 230) The dual purpose of
the BPP survival programs is best appreciated through examining how such
programs looked both to save and organize the Black community along
revolutionary intercommunal lines. [Survival programs such as the BPP
free breakfasts for school children and medical centres inherently dealt
with the racial disparities of US welfare capitalism. This brought the
racial contradictions of the US state's ideas of universalism into full
view and sought to organize the Black community around these
contradictions]{.underline}. However, a common misconception about the
BPP's survival programs is that they were solely for the Black community
and not truly intercommunal. [Although the Panthers embedded these
programs in poor, Black working-class communities, they often offered
their services to the whole of society on the basis of unity in class
struggle.]{.underline} As New York BPP leader Carlton Yearwood
explained, 'when we provide free breakfast for school children, we
provide them for poor whites and poor blacks'. This commitment to class
struggle across its racial modalities could also be found in the BPP
medical centres. Although the centres highlighted and focused on
problems specific to the Black community, such as sickle cell anaemia,
BPP-run medical centres offered services to all people no matter their
colour (Bloom and Martin, 2013: 187, 292; Burke and Jefferies, 2016:
111--114; Spencer, 2016). BPP survival programs thus offered real
institutional Narayan 195 glimpses of an actual true universalism that
transcended the racial divisions of US welfare capitalism. The BPP
survival programs did not only offer alternative institutional forms of
community cooperation and collaboration that transgressed the racial
division of US welfare capitalism. They also offered a critique of the
political economy of capitalism and offered glimpses of alternative,
anti-capitalist forms of community cooperation and collaboration. BPP
survival programs inherently questioned the nature of wage-labour and
profit in their organization and delivery: All our survival programs are
free. We have never charged the community a dime to receive the things
they need from any of our programs and we will not do so. (Newton, 2002:
230) While the Party, through its various chapters across the US, often
initiated programs, the day-to-day running of them often involved the
wider community, local businesses, churches and professionals such as
doctors and nurses. Survival programs depended on such people
volunteering their time and labour and organizations offering space and
resources. Panther-run medical centres, for example, often saw white and
black middle class healthcare professionals offering their labour for
free and being coordinated and managed by BPP members and community
volunteers (Burke and Jefferies, 2016: 111--114). [This questioning of
the capitalist political economy was embodied in the BPP's approach to
funding their survival programs.]{.underline} From 1971 onwards the
Panthers shifted from an earlier blanket denouncement of Black
capitalism (Black owned business) to embracing the limited merits of
Black capitalism for the Black community. This saw the BPP utilize
resources donated or cajoled from local Black businesses in order to
fund survival programs. Newton offered an explanation of such a new
approach by attempting to highlight how Black capitalism's funding of
the survival programs heightened the contradictions between Black
capitalism and a (white) corporate capitalism that dominated both the
Black community and Black capitalists: When the Black capitalist
contributes to the survival programs and makes a contribution to the
community, the community will give him their support and thus strengthen
his business. If he does not make any contribution to the survival of
the community, the people will not support him and his enterprise will
wither away because of his own negligence. By supporting the community,
however, he will be helping to build the political machine that will
eventually negate his exploitation of the community, but also negate his
being exploited and victimized by corporate capitalism . . . In this way
Black capitalism will be transformed from a relationship of exploitation
of the community to a relationship of service to the community, which
will contribute to the survival of everyone. (Newton, 2002: 233) [Black
capitalism's funding of survival programs, or rather the return of Black
capitalism's profits to its community, would therefore bring forth its
own negation through providing a context that would allow the
anti-capitalist nature of evolutionary intercommunalism to take
seed:]{.underline} 196 Current Sociology Monograph 1 68(2) [The most
important element in controlling our own institutions would be to
organise into cooperatives, which would end all forms of exploitation.
Then the profits, or surplus, from the cooperatives would be returned to
the community, expanding opportunities on all levels, and enriching
life. Beyond this, our ultimate aim is to have various ethnic
communities cooperating in a spirit of mutual aid, rather than
competing.]{.underline} In this way, all communities would be allied in
a common purpose. (Newton, 2009a \[1972\]: 178) [BPP survival programs
post-1970 functioned to provide practical measures to materially and
ideologically survive the effects of reactionary intercommunalism but
also offered examples of new ways of organizing labour and capital that
offered people glimpses of transcending reactionary intercommunalism
altogether]{.underline}. The institutional practices of the BPP's
survival programs, as Singh (2004: 205--206) has suggested, are best
seen as a 'projection of sovereignty' that rivalled the 'reality
principle' of the US state. This entailed a practical deconstruction of
the idea of state power (policing, education, welfare), which reimagined
spaces and practices along anti-capitalist and intercommunal lines of
self-determination. The [BPP survival programs offered alternative ways
of life to the racially divisive, class exploitative and gendered10
structures of capitalist society and were aimed towards eliciting a
broad spectrum of support for these alternative forms of
life.]{.underline} The BPP survival programs thus reimagined and
reorganized institutions (welfare, employment, local economy) that were
being destroyed or co-opted by the processes of reactionary
intercommunalism. This is made explicit by Elaine Brown's comments, in
1972, which articulate that resisting the material and ideological
effects of a new form of global capitalism was now the fundamental
rationale of the BPP and its approach of survival pending revolution:

**Revolutionary intercommunalism has the capacity to fight capitalist
imperialist violence**

**United Panther Movement**, 04-29-20**16** ("Revolutionary
Intercommunalism: Not Some Cool Idea," Kevin "Rashin" Johnson,
http://rashidmod.com/?p=2113)//pk

[Revolutionary Intercommunalism is not just some cool idea Huey P.
Newton had as in a utopian pipe dream. It is in fact the logical and
necessary next step]{.underline} in human social evolution/revolution.
Huey, and the central committee of the original Black Panther Party
(BPP), arrived at this theory by applying Marxism (Dialectical
Materialism) to make a fresh analysis of how the world was hooked up at
that time (1970) and the trajectory of its development. This was
necessary, because they were serious revolutionaries, and as Marx
explained: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they
please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under
circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The
tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains
of the living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing
themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before,
precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure
up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names,
battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world
history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language." ― Karl Marx,
18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) To be dialectical means to see
the duality in things, that everything exists as a unity of opposites
and that there is both unity and struggle between the opposing aspects
of a thing. This struggle determines the development of the thing, and
one aspect is always principal. When the secondary aspect of a thing
becomes the principal aspect, a revolution takes place that changes the
character of the thing. Things exist in relation to other things and are
affected by them, but the principal cause of change is internal to the
thing. Plants grow to reach for the sunlight because internally they
need the sunlight to live and to grow healthy. The struggle to survive
drives the internal contradiction within the plant. In any complex set
of contradictions, [there is always one that is principal influencing
the development of the other contradictions in a major way. In the
United Panther Movement (UPM) led by the New Afrikan Black Panther Party
Prison Chapter (NABPP-PC), we say the principal contradiction in the
world at this time is between the need of the monopoly capitalist ruling
class to consolidate their global capitalist-imperialist hegemony and
the chaos and anarchy they are unleashing by attempting to do so,
including the danger of instigating nuclear war.]{.underline} This is
manifesting itself all over the world -- and particularly in the Middle
East and the Ukraine, and increasingly in Afrika, Latin America and Asia
-- and also here in the U.S., and we can see it in how the Presidential
election is unfolding. Hillary Clinton appears to be the monopoly
capitalist oligarchy's choice to replace Obama, but as his Secretary of
State, she is closely tied to his legacy of unleashing chaos in the
Middle East, and particularly the debacle in Libya and the ongoing proxy
war in Syria. She's got a lot of blood on her hands. Bernie Sanders
appears to have been tapped to pull younger, more progressive, voters
back into the Democratic Party and then to close ranks with Hillary
after she wins the nomination to defeat the Republican Party candidate.
This seems likely to be Donald Trump, who seems to have been taped to
play the role of racist-populist demagogue to rally the party's chaotic
right-wing base and alienate the moderates to switch tickets and support
Hillary. After eight years of working to undermine the Obama
administration and fanning the flames of racism, Trump is releasing the
pent up frustration of the white middle and working class base Agnew
dubbed the "silent majority." But they are no longer the majority and if
Trump is defeated, they are unlikely to be silent. If he should win,
they would be empowered and able to give rein to their hate against
Blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, Gays, Jews, immigrants, leftists, atheists,
disabled and so on. Trump is unleashing forces he cannot control and
playing with a polarization that could unleash serious anarchy and civil
war. Bernie Sanders, a Jew and self-styled "Socialist," would seem to be
the logical target for their hate, but they seem to be too focused on
hating Hillary and the political class of insiders she represents. Many
of Trump's supporters also consider voting for Sanders if he gets the
Democrat Party nomination. Even if Sander's supporters vote for Hillary
to block Trump, they are unlikely to support her foreign and domestic
policies. In any event, the polarization of the masses into "left" and
right camps is likely to continue and intensify no matter who gets
elected. In other words, the two party system that has stabilized the
dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (bush-wah-zee), or
capitalist-imperialism, is pulling apart and will likely continue to do
so. The Weapon of Theory "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course,
replace criticism of the weapon, material force must be overthrown by
material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it
has gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon
as it demonstrates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as
it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter.
But, for man, the root is man himself." --- Karl Marx, Critique of
Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Introduction (1843) The Theory of
Revolutionary Intercommunalism recognizes that the World Proletarian
Socialist Revolution, which began in Marx's time, has entered a new
phase as Mao Tse-tung predicted. As Mao pointed out: "[At present, the
world revolution has entered a great new era. The struggle of the Black
people in the United States for emancipation is a component part of the
general struggle of all the people of the world against U.S.
imperialism, a component part of the contemporary world
revolution]{.underline}. I call on the workers, peasants, and
revolutionary intellectuals of all countries and all who are willing to
fight against U.S. imperialism to take action and extend strong support
to the struggle of the Black people in the United States! [People of the
whole world, unite still more closely and launch a sustained and
vigorous offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its
accomplices! It can be said with certainty that the complete collapse of
colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the
complete emancipation of all the oppressed peoples and nations of the
world are not far off."]{.underline} -- Mao Tse-tung, "A New Storm
Against Imperialism" (1968) The principal aspect of this "new era" is
the global hegemony of U.S.-centered capitalist-imperialism, which makes
the existence of independent national economies and political autonomy
impossible. Like it or not, the only way to escape the clutches of
empire is to end it. As Mao explained: "[Racial discrimination in the
United States is a product of the colonialist and imperialist system.
The contradiction between the Black masses in the United States and the
U.S. ruling circles is a class contradiction. Only by overthrowing the
reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class and destroying
the colonialist and imperialist system can the Black people in the
United States win complete emancipation. The Black masses and the masses
of white working people in the United States have common interests and
common objectives to struggle for. Therefore, the Afro-American struggle
is winning sympathy and support from increasing numbers of white working
people and progressives in the United States.]{.underline} The struggle
of the Black people in the United States is bound to merge with the
American workers' movement, and this will eventually end the criminal
rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class." -- Ibid. In other words,
Mao saw that the principal contradiction had shifted away from that
between the colonial and semi-colonial countries and the imperialist
countries. In summarizing Huey's theory, Comrade Kevin "Rashid" Johnson,
the Minister of Defense of NABPP-PC, pointed out: "The Party \[BPP\]
first based itself on nationalism because, he \[Huey\] said, he
believed, as did many, that a subjugated people could gain their freedom
by forming their own independent nation states. But this proved
inadequate; even for socialist nations, because Amerika had grown to
become a literal world 'empire' and so effectively integrated and
dominated the world's economy, lands and peoples, that none could truly
break away from that system to exist or develop as free and independent
states. "The condition of colonialism had evolved to such a level that
Amerika fed off the wealth and resources of the entire world, but
without need of maintaining its own administration or settler presence
inside the foreign domains, as the old colonial system had. But the
concept of neo-colonialism did not adequately define this relationship
either, he said, because all the old colonies were not merely ruled over
by local lackeys, but rather the entire societies had been integrated
into a globally interconnected system like that of so many communities,
instead of as an arrangement of separate sovereign nations. He called
this system "Reactionary Intercommunalism." "Because they could not
decolonize, (become independent and free nation states with control over
their own economic development and institutions), nationalism and
internationalism made no sense. As he noted the basis of decolonization
or national independence is that a colonized people be able to reclaim
or return to their previously existing stages of development or
otherwise develop their own productive forces. "But he saw this world
system with its interconnected technologies, cultures and communication
systems as able, if brought under collective control of the masses
rather than that of a small circle of super-rich administrators, to
provide for everyone's needs, solve all the world's problems, and create
a communal culture that could end the prevalence of perpetual war and
social chaos. This new social order he called Revolutionary
Intercommunalism, or World Socialism, and a precursor to the Communist
World (a world free of oppression and exploitation) which Marxists
aspire to." -- Kevin "Rashid" Johnson, "In Search of the Right Theory
for Today's Struggles: Revisiting Huey P. Newton's Theory of
Revolutionary Intercommunalism (2015) With some 900 U.S. military bases
in some 153 out of 257 countries in the world, not to mention military
alliances, overthrowing the U.S. empire must necessarily be a world
revolution fought on many fronts. Having achieved victory and defeated
the ruling class, and seized control of the basic means of production
and expropriated the assets of the big bourgeoisie, it would be
necessary to establish a world proletarian dictatorship to carry out
socialist reconstruction of the world economy. Global people's war must
necessarily unite the world proletariat under a common banner and
revolutionary headquarters. Speaking to a conference of non-aligned
nations and movements in Havana in 1966, the great Afrikan revolutionary
leader Amilcar Cabral stated: "It is with the intention of making a
contribution, however modest, to this debate that we present here our
opinion of the foundations and objectives of national liberation in
relation to the social structure. This opinion is the result of our own
experiences of the struggle and of a critical appreciation of the
experiences of others. To those who see in it a theoretical character,
we would recall that every practice produces a theory, and that if it is
true that a revolution can fail even though it be based on perfectly
conceived theories, nobody has yet made a successful revolution without
a revolutionary theory. "Those who affirm --- in our case correctly ---
that the motive force of history is the class struggle would certainly
agree to a revision of this affirmation to make it more precise and give
it an even wider field of application if they had a better knowledge of
the essential characteristics of certain colonized peoples, that is to
say peoples dominated by imperialism. In fact in the general evolution
of humanity and of each of the peoples of which it is composed, classes
appear neither as a generalized and simultaneous phenomenon throughout
the totality of these groups, nor as a finished, perfect, uniform and
spontaneous whole. The definition of classes within one or several human
groups is a fundamental consequence of the progressive development of
the productive forces and of the characteristics of the distribution of
the wealth produced by the group or usurped from others. That is to say
that the socio-economic phenomenon 'class' is created and develops as a
function of at least two essential and interdependent variables --- the
level of productive forces and the pattern of ownership of the means of
production. This development takes place slowly, gradually and unevenly,
by quantitative and generally imperceptible variations in the
fundamental components; once a certain degree of accumulation is
reached, this process then leads to a qualitative jump, characterized by
the appearance of classes and of conflict between them. "Factors
external to the socio-economic whole can influence, more or less
significantly, the process of development of classes, accelerating it,
slowing it down and even causing regressions. When, for whatever reason,
the influence of these factors ceases, the process reassumes its
independence and its rhythm is then determined not only be the specific
internal characteristics of the whole, but also by the resultant of the
effect produced in it by the temporary action of the external factors.
On a strictly internal level the rhythm of the process may vary, but it
remains continuous and progressive. Sudden progress is only possible as
a function of violent alterations --- mutations --- in the level of
productive forces or in the pattern of ownership. These violent
transformations carried out within the process of development of
classes, as a result of mutations in the level of productive forces or
in the pattern of ownership, are generally called, in economic and
political language, revolutions." -- Amilcar Cabral, "The Weapon of
Theory" (1966) What Comrade Cabral was getting at here is the unevenness
in development of classes and class struggle in the different countries
and communities in the colonial and neo-colonial countries, and in
contrast to the imperialist countries. He stated: "Another important
distinction between the colonial and neo-colonial situations is in the
prospects for the struggle. The colonial situation (in which the nation
class fights the repressive forces of the bourgeoisie of the colonizing
country) can lead, apparently at least, to a nationalist solution
(national revolution); the nation gains its independence and
theoretically adopts the economic structure which best suits it. The
neo-colonial situation (in which the working classes and their allies
struggle simultaneously against the imperialist bourgeoisie and the
native ruling class) is not resolved by a nationalist solution; it
demands the destruction of the capitalist structure implanted in the
national territory by imperialism, and correctly postulates a socialist
solution." -- Ibid Fifty years later, colonialism has almost everywhere
been replaced by neo-colonialism and integration into the global economy
dominated by capitalist-imperialism. "Dollar Diplomacy" and IMF
"structural readjustments" have subordinated the newly "independent"
countries of the "Third World" to neo-liberal policies and corporate
penetration of the countries' basic institutions. In many cases the U.S.
has replaced the former colonial powers in training their military
establishment as well as arming and equipping them. A national solution
becomes ever more unlikely and a socialist solution ever more necessary.
By developing struggle and the revolutionary movement inside the U.S.,
we will create more favorable conditions for anti-imperialist struggle
and revolution in the neo-colonial countries and every country under the
yoke of capitalist-imperialism. Building a global United Panther
Movement to lead the struggle of the urban poor will have a "blow-back"
effect here that will empower our struggle. Whose Lives Matter? "Black
Lives Matter" is a correct slogan but not necessarily the best one. With
the exception of the movement led by the original Black Panther Party
(BPP), the Black movement against racial discrimination and oppression
in the U.S. has historically been aimed at appealing to the rich ruling
class whites, the 1%, to make concessions, whether it be integration,
affirmative action, reparations or self-determination. Whether humbly
begging or militantly demanding, the thrust is attempting to reform the
capitalist system without altering the foundation of class exploitation
and global imperialism. When the Panthers put forward the slogan "Power
to the People," they unleashed a whirlwind that resonated well beyond
the Black movement. They were aiming at and appealing to all the
oppressed people -- in Amerika and around the world -- not begging for
reforms but uniting for fundamental and revolutionary change. As Fred
Hampton said: "Power anywhere where there's people. Power anywhere where
there's people. Let me give you an example of teaching people.
Basically, the way they learn is observation and participation. You know
a lot of us go around and joke ourselves and believe that the masses
have PhDs, but that's not true. And even if they did, it wouldn't make
any difference. Because with some things, you have to learn by seeing it
or either participating in it. And you know yourselves that there are
people walking around your community today that have all types of
degrees that should be at this meeting but are not here. Right? Because
you can have as many degrees as a thermometer, if you don't have any
practice, then you can't walk across the street and chew gum at the same
time... "We got to face some facts. That the masses are poor, that the
masses belong to what you call the lower class, and when I talk about
the masses, I'm talking about the white masses, I'm talking about the
black masses, and the brown masses, and the yellow masses, too. We've
got to face the fact that some people say you fight fire best with fire,
but we say you put fire out best with water. We say you don't fight
racism with racism. We're gonna fight racism with solidarity. We say you
don't fight capitalism with no black capitalism; you fight capitalism
with socialism. "We ain't gonna fight no reactionary pigs who run up and
down the street being reactionary; we're gonna organize and dedicate
ourselves to revolutionary political power and teach ourselves the
specific needs of resisting the power structure, arm ourselves, and
we're gonna fight reactionary pigs with INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIAN
REVOLUTION. That's what it has to be. The people have to have the power:
it belongs to the people." -- Fred Hampton, "Power Anywhere Where
There's People" (1969) Comrade Fred didn't get killed in his sleep
because he was some Black racist terrorist or gangster, but because he
was "Speaking Truth to Power!" [The greatest fear the exploiter has is
the masses of the oppressed and exploited people coming together to take
back what it rightfully ours -- power over our lives.]{.underline}
Liberation is not slavery without shackles and leg irons, it is not the
opportunity to become a Black capitalist or a Brown capitalist or
whatever, and perpetuate this rotten system of class privilege and
oppression. Liberation is getting free of all that and ending it for
future generations. Liberation is revolution to achieve ALL POWER TO THE
PEOPLE! Create Public Opinion Seize Power [Mao summed up revolution as
"create public opinion seize power." Our first and primary duty is to
create public opinion in favor of overthrowing the
capitalist-imperialist system, racism and police state repression. As
Malcolm X summed up, "You can't have capitalism without racism." In
combatting racism, we must confront the lie that there is anything
normal about racism and expose that the very idea of separate races and
racial superiority was the invention of the capitalists to excuse their
many crimes against humanity, and particularly chattel slavery in the
Americas.]{.underline} "We have to understand very clearly that there's
a man in our community called a capitalist. Sometimes he's black and
sometimes he's white. But that man has to be driven out of our
community, because anybody who comes into the community to make profit
off the people by exploiting them can be defined as a capitalist. And we
don't care how many programs they have, how long a dashiki they have.
Because political power does not flow from the sleeve of a dashiki;
political power flows from the barrel of a gun. It flows from the barrel
of a gun!" -- Ibid [We have to be conscious that the enemy sends his
agents among us and their job is to mislead the people, misdirect the
people, and play one section of the people against another. They do it
in the white community, the Black community and every other community.
These so called "community leaders'" job is to "dumb down" the masses
and feed them racist, nationalist and in general reactionary
ideology]{.underline}. They do on a small scale what Donald Trump is
doing on a big scale right now, and we have to expose that shit for what
it is. As Fred Hampton said: "So what did we do? We were out there
educating the people. How did we educate them? Basically, the way people
learn, by observation and participation. And that's what we're trying to
do. That's what we got to do here in this community. And a lot of people
don't understand, but there's three basic things that you got to do
anytime you intend to have yourself a successful revolution. "A lot of
people get the word revolution mixed up and they think revolution's a
bad word. Revolution is nothing but like having a sore on your body and
then you put something on that sore to cure that infection. And I'm
telling you that were living in an infectious society right now. I'm
telling you that were living in a sick society. And anybody that
endorses integrating into this sick society before its cleaned up is a
man who's committing a crime against the people. "If you walk past a
hospital room and see a sign that says "Contaminated" and then you try
to lead people into that room, either those people are mighty dumb, you
understand me, cause if they weren't, they'd tell you that you are an
unfair, unjust leader that does not have your followers' interests in
mind. And what we're saying is simply that leaders have got to become,
we've got to start making them accountable for what they do. They're
goin' around talking about so-and-so's an Uncle Tom so we're gonna open
up a cultural center and teach him what blackness is. And this
n\*\*\*\*r is more aware than you and me and Malcolm and Martin Luther
King and everybody else put together. That's right. They're the ones
that are most aware. They're most aware, cause they're the ones that are
gonna open up the center. They're gonna tell you where bones come from
in Africa that you can't even pronounce the names. That's right. They'll
be telling you about Chaka, the leader of the Bantu freedom fighters,
and Jomo Kenyatta, those dingo-dingas. They'll be running all of that
down to you. They know about it all. But the point is they do what
they're doing because it is beneficial and it is profitable for them.
"You see, people get involved in a lot of things that's profitable to
them, and we've got to make it less profitable. We've got to make it
less beneficial. I'm saying that any program that's brought into our
community should be analyzed by the people of that community. It should
be analyzed to see that it meets the relevant needs of that community.
We don't need no n\*\*\*\*\*s coming into our community to be having no
company to open business for the n\*\*\*\*\*s. There's too many
n\*\*\*\*\*s in our community that can't get crackers out of the
business that they're gonna open." -- Ibid [Revolutionary
intercommunalism provides a theoretical basis, based on the practice of
the original BPP, to unite all the oppressed -- both within the U.S. and
around the world -- with the common objective and strategy to overthrow
capitalist-imperialism and socialize ownership of the basic means of
production in the global economy. There are different forces out there
calling themselves "revolutionary" or claiming to be "Black Panthers"
who are promoting an ideological-political line that is opposed to
Pantherism. In this period, making revolution requires a higher level of
political consciousness. Nationalism doesn't cut it. At best it is
insufficient and at worst it is deliberate misdirection in the service
of capitalist-imperialism.]{.underline}

[Ensuring that anti-capitalism is at the core of Indigenous resurgence

tactics like traffic- and train blockading an anti-capitalist impulse,
**rooted** in the disruption of the sphere of circulation. Such actions
'seek to impede or block the flow of resources currently being
transported to international markets]{.underline} from oil and gas
fields, refineries, lumber mills, mining operations, and hydroelectric
facilities located on the dispossessed lands of Indigenous nations'. 16
[Such actions are consciously built to intensify their 'negative impact
on [the economic infrastructure]{.mark} that [is **core** to]{.mark} the
**[colonial accumulation]{.mark}** of capital in settler-political
economies]{.underline} like Canada's'. 17 Although Coulthard does not
highlight the connection, this strategic orientation resonates in many
ways with what might be labelled the turn to circulation in much of
contemporary Marxist and anarchist strategic theory, particularly in the
domain of historical-materialist geography. 18 Another urgent concern of
Coulthard's anti-capitalist thesis is again one of socio-geography: 'how
might we begin to scale up these often localized, resurgent land-based
direct actions to produce a more general transformation in the colonial
economy?' 19 He recognises that [[short of a 'massive transformation in

The second [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps more popular than
the first, [[is]{.mark} to stand up]{.underline} always against
"imperialism"---or, a shortcut inside the shortcut, [**[always]{.mark}
to oppose** American policies abroad]{.underline}.
[**[Anti-Americanism]{.mark}** is a common left politics]{.underline},
which, again, sometimes gets things right and sometimes doesn't. I
believe that it got things right in Vietnam in 1967; it mostly got
things right from the beginning to the end of the twentieth century in
Central and South America; it got Iran right in 1953, when leftists
criticized the anti-Mossadegh coup, and it got Iraq right in 2003. But
that's not enough to make the shortcut a reliable one. The [[defeat of
**Nazism** and **Stalinism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the two [**[most
brutal]{.mark} political [regimes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} world [history,
was]{.mark}]{.underline} in significant ways [[American
work]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many peopl[e on the left supported
that]{.underline} work, [as we should]{.underline} have.

In 1967, Dwight Macdonald wrote to Mary McCarthy that the American war
in Vietnam proved "that despite all the good things about our internal
political-social-cultural life, we have become an imperialist power, and
one that, partly because of these domestic virtues, is a most inept
one."37 We are still inept: in December 2005, with 100,000 American
soldiers in Iraq, we organized an election there --- and our man came in
third. This result may be without precedent in imperial history. (It
might suggest that we were less interested in imperial control than in
promoting democracy, though the Iraqi politician who came in first
wasn't much of a democrat.) Macdonald's understanding of US imperialism
reflects a political intelligence and a moral balance that are mostly
missing in contemporary anti-American writing.

Another often used shortcut is to oppose everything Israel does and to
blame it for much that it hasn't done, since it is the "lackey" of
American imperialism or, alternatively, the dominant force shaping
American foreign policy. The policies of recent Israeli governments
require strong criticism --- the occupation, the settlements, the
refusal to suppress Jewish thugs and terrorists on the West Bank. But
much of the left attack on Israel has little to do with its policies and
more to do with its existence, which is taken to be the root cause of
all evils in the Middle East. This view violates all the requirements of
realism --- by which I mean simply a readiness to see the world as it
really is.

The last [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark} is [to [support every
government that calls itself **leftist or**]{.mark}
**anti-imperialist**]{.underline} and [sets itself **[against
America]{.mark}**]{.underline}n interests. This is different from the
old Stalinist shortcut: support the Soviet Union, whatever it does,
because it is the first proletarian dictatorship and the first workers'
paradise. [[That]{.mark} kind of [politics is]{.mark}]{.underline}, I
think, definitively finished, though it had a brief afterlife focused on
China and then, with very few believers, on Albania and
[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}. The more recent
version celebrates Maximal Leaders like Gamal Nasser, Fidel Castro, or
Hugo Chávez; there are also short-lived infatuations, such as Michel
Foucault's affair with the future Ayatollah Khomeini. [[Leftist
enthusiasm for **populist dictatorships**]{.mark} is one of our **sad
stories**]{.underline}, which ends when resources run out, the failure
to build the economy suddenly becomes undeniable, and the military takes
over. [[But]{.mark} often the]{.underline} Maximal [[Leader is a
military]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~man himself~~ \[[[person
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}\], [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[repressive role]{.underline}]{.mark} of the army simply
[[becomes]{.mark} **more [obvious]{.mark}** [over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Latin America today, the better left is
represented by socialists and social-democrats in countries like Chile,
Brazil, and Costa Rica who reject demagogic populism and struggle to
produce economic growth, greater equality, and a stronger welfare state
--- and who attract less enthusiasm from American leftists than they
deserve.38

There is a lot to be said for [the **default position**. [We
should]{.mark} work]{.underline} in the place we know best [to [make
things better]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[improvement of
**humanity**]{.mark} begins]{.underline} at home. This argument has
special force for Americans, who live [[in a]{.mark}n]{.underline}
increasingly unequal society that is also a near-[[hegemonic world
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need to be wary of adventures abroad that
make our work at home more difficult.

Still, good leftists can't avoid internationalism. We will be engaged
again and again in arguments about what we should do or what we should
urge the United States to do to help people in trouble or comrades
abroad. Sometimes there is nothing that the United States can do, at
least nothing it is likely to do right. But even when we oppose American
action in other countries, we can be active ourselves --- providing
moral, political, and financial support to \[people\] ~~men and women~~
fighting in self-defense or in defense of others. There is no magic
answer to the question, What should we do? But the [[ideological
shortcuts]{.underline}]{.mark} I've just described, [**[lazily]{.mark}
adopted** and rigidly [held]{.mark}]{.underline}, have [served us badly
in the past and are]{.underline} almost [certain to [serve us
badly]{.mark} in the future. [Sticking with them
means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[get]{.mark} [things right **only by accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Political intelligence and moral sensitivity work much better than
ideology, and they are what should guide our choice of comrades and our
decisions about when and how to act abroad.
**[[Dictators]{.underline}]{.mark}** and terrorists [[are **never our
comrades**]{.mark}. We should embrace]{.underline} only those ~~men and
women~~ \[people\] who really believe in and practice [democracy and
equality. We should act abroad]{.underline} only [with those who **share
our commitments**]{.underline} and then, only in ways consistent with
those commitments. This is the politics that I want to call left
internationalism.

[[Beijing's criticism of the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, however, differs from that seen around
the globe. China's critique [[does not stem from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**genuine [concern]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} universal
[**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights and]{.underline} the [well-being
of African Americans]{.underline}. The [[Chinese
people]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[opportunity to
protest]{.underline}]{.mark} in solidarity with Americans --- or
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[abuses of black residents in
China]{.mark} itself. **Anti-black [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
remains [[rampant]{.mark} on the Chinese internet]{.underline},
untouched by [[censors]{.underline}]{.mark} who seek to [[**crush
opinions** the government dislikes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its
[[motivation is]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[to tell the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, and everybody else,
[[to stop criticizing China over its own]{.mark} **human rights
[abuses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Underneath Beijing's commentary on the
U.S. unrest is a deeply cynical voice that asks: If the U.S. authorities
can do it, why shouldn't we?

Last Friday afternoon, Trump held a press conference to denounce China's
plan to devise a national security law to crack down on Hong Kong's
dissents. He threatened to end U.S. recognition of Hong Kong's special
trading status and to sanction Chinese officials hurting Hong Kong's
freedom. It is going to bring real damage to [**[Chinese]{.mark}
companies** and **wealthy [elites]{.mark}**]{.underline} who have been
[[using Hong Kong as a back door]{.mark} to]{.underline} gain access to
foreign capital, sensitive technology, and channels to [relocate their
wealth oversea]{.underline}s.

That night, after Trump's speech, major cities across the United States
were engulfed in flames, National Guards were mobilized, and protesters
clashed with riot police near the White House. The president reportedly
hid briefly in a bunker. The [Chinese authorities]{.underline} have been
heavily criticized for their [[crackdown on]{.mark} **Hong Kong
[protests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for the Uighur [[concentration camps,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the [[arrests of]{.mark} rights [lawyers.
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} must be [[delighted to
see]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U.S.]{.mark} **global
[reputation]{.mark}** [tarnished]{.mark}]{.underline} as its problems of
racism and police brutality are brought into the spotlight. It would be
surprising if [Beijing]{.underline} did not [[seize]{.mark} the [moment
to **criticize** the]{.mark}]{.underline} double standards of the
[[White House]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [cynicism [underlines]{.mark}
Beijing's]{.underline} response to criticism of its [[bullying
behavior]{.mark} in the international arena]{.underline}. When an
international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines
against Chinese claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea in 2016,
Beijing made it clear it would not abide by the ruling. It pointed out
that the United States violated international law all the time and,
hypocritically, hadn't even acceded to the relevant U.N. convention
itself.

Such [rhetoric]{.underline} has [grown common over]{.underline} the
[last few decades]{.underline}, as the [**[C]{.mark}**hinese
**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty]{.underline} gradually
abandoned its appeal for a more just social system and world order.
Instead, the party has become [**increasingly [explicit]{.mark}** [in
referring to]{.mark}]{.underline} the global [[domination by Western
powers as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**license** for its own imperial
ambition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Jiang Shigong, an influential official
scholar who advises the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy and
global governance, even wrote recently that China should "absorb the
skills and achievements" of the British and American empires to
construct its own "world empire" for the sake of the Chinese people and
the world.

For those in the United States and elsewhere who aspire for more
equality, justice, and liberty, [it is a [mistake to see Beijing
as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**exotic [progressive]{.mark}** force with
which to ally]{.underline}. [[Beijing points to the]{.mark}
violence]{.underline} and injustice [of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [to exonerate]{.mark} itself from [its own]{.mark}
**egregious [violence]{.mark}** [and injustices]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Police brutality and racism in the United States are unimaginably
horrific. But [[U.S.]{.mark} authorities]{.underline} today are [[not
using]{.mark} these [protests as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[excuse
to]{.underline}]{.mark} arrest dissenting legislators and professors, to
wholly outlaw peaceful assembly and rights organizations, to pressure
companies and universities to fire employees sympathetic with the
protesters, to arrest people for criticizing the government on social
media, or to [[lock up]{.underline}]{.mark} 1 million
[[minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in reeducation camps. [[These]{.mark}
**abuses [are routine]{.mark}** [in China]{.mark} and]{.underline}

#### Russia's worse.

But [[African leaders should have]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[more
fundamental [concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** than these --- at least,
those who are committed to advancing peace and democracy.
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} is [attempting to undermine the global
order that]{.underline} has [guided international relations for
the]{.underline} better part of the [last century]{.underline}.
[Building on]{.underline} Russia's previous annexation of [Crimea
and]{.underline} parts of northern [Georgia]{.underline} as well as its
prior occupation of [Ukraine's]{.underline} Donbas region, [Putin is
[taking a **sledgehammer** to the]{.mark} foundation of the]{.underline}
once stable [**post-[World]{.mark} War II** [order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This attempt to normalize expansionist ambitions [will [have **profound
consequences** for Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would-be [[tsars]{.mark}
[across the continent]{.mark}]{.underline} --- who, like Putin, have
[[evade]{.mark}d [term limits]{.mark} to stay in power
indefinitely]{.underline} while [[eliminat]{.mark}ing]{.underline} their
[[political opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} --- are watching closely,
asking if Putin can [get away with]{.underline} this [**brazen
[overreach]{.mark}** and flout the rules-based order]{.underline}, then
why can't they. It is a reasonable question to ask. [At stake
are]{.underline} established notions of
[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, territorial integrity,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[independence of member
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which **suddenly
[become]{.mark}**]{.underline} more temporal, arbitrary, and [[open to
**violent contestation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Perhaps the most eloquent defense of the existing order, premised on
these foundational principles, came from Kenya's permanent
representative to the United Nations: ambassador Martin Kimani, who
warned Putin and the Russian military to respect its border with
Ukraine, using [[Africa's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [colonial
[past]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[dangers of]{.mark} stoking the]{.underline} "**[embers of [dead
empires]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

So what does a Russian-shaped international order look like for Africa?

A [primary feature is]{.underline} the [challenge to the
**inviolability** of established boundaries]{.underline}. There are
currently some 100 contested borders on the continent, most of them
stemming from arbitrarily drawn colonial boundaries. These have, for the
most part, been managed peacefully by successive [African
governments]{.underline}, [rooted in]{.underline} a [respect
for]{.underline} the principles of [[sovereignty]{.mark} and territorial
[integrity]{.mark}]{.underline} that were enshrined in the Charter of
the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and later reaffirmed in the
Constitutive Act of the African Union in 2001. Established during the
postcolonial independence period, many African states were born out of a
commitment to [[self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically,
[this is [the **central issue**]{.mark} being [contested]{.mark} today
[by **Russia**]{.mark}**'s invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}.

If the lesson from Putin's invasion of Ukraine is that might makes
right, then [Africa's political geography could be **perpetually in
dispute**]{.underline}. In other words, [if]{.underline} the
[overlapping security guarantees]{.underline} provided by both the U.N.
and AU charters [can be violated with impunity]{.underline}, [then what
is to stop African leaders who envy Putin's **[aggressive]{.mark}
brand** of [authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline} from
[[follow]{.mark}ing suit]{.underline}?

Already, we see this happening in some parts of Africa.

The volatile African Great Lakes region stands out for the fragility of
its borders. The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example,
has become a target for exploitation by authoritarian leaders in
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, officially
in power since 2000, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power
since 1986, have routinely marched their troops and proxies as well as
directed their allied rebel groups to seize Congolese territory, loot
natural resources, and kill citizens with alarming impunity. In October
2021, Congolese authorities reported clashing with Rwandan troops, who
allegedly occupied several villages before retreating. And as recently
as March, the Congolese army presented evidence that the Kagame regime
was actively backing a rebellion in eastern Congo. Disregarding borders
is particularly precarious in the Great Lakes region because it carries
with it the potential to reignite one of the most cataclysmic conflicts
in recent history.

Similarly, Moscow has played a destabilizing role in Africa. Recent
years have illuminated a "new scramble for Africa" as external actors
seek to aggressively plant their politics, governance, and economic
flags across the continent. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [at
the forefront of]{.underline} this [predatory behavior by **repeatedly
[propping]{.mark}** [up]{.mark}]{.underline} isolated and [authoritarian
leaders]{.underline} --- most notably in [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[C]{.mark}entral [A]{.mark}frican [R]{.mark}epublic]{.underline},
[[Mali]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- to
advance Moscow's patently anti-democratic influence.

[[Through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[deployment of]{.mark} **shadowy and
[unaccountable]{.mark}** mercenary [groups]{.mark}]{.underline},
[polarizing [disinformation]{.mark} campaigns]{.underline}, [[election
interference]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and arms-for-resource]{.underline}
deals, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has gained influence while
[[fostering instability and]{.mark} the increased **h**uman **r**ights
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline} that ultimately result from it.

[Russia]{.underline} has [also fomented]{.underline} --- both covertly
and overtly --- and been quick to support the many unconstitutional
[seizures of power]{.underline} recently witnessed in Africa. The
[**spate of [coups]{.mark}** and]{.underline} increasing instances of
[African leaders scrapping term limits]{.underline}, for example, better
[suit Moscow's]{.underline} vision of [remaking]{.underline} the
international order in its autocratic mold.

That a Russian-shaped order in Africa would be more oppressive is
crucial to note since most of the 16 ongoing internal conflicts on the
continent have deep roots in authoritarian forms of governance. None of
Africa's established democracies, in contrast, are in conflict. More
authoritarianism, then, can be expected to yield more conflict.

[[Tolerance for predatory]{.mark} interstate
[behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} globally, moreover, will
[[embolden]{.mark} elevated]{.underline} forms of
[[repression]{.underline}]{.mark} domestically in African states. After
all, if the enshrined principles of self-determination and popular
participation are not respected in a high-profile instance, such as
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then what international actors can be
compelled to penalize the intimidation or jailing of opposition leaders,
the shuttering of independent media outlets, and the brazen rigging of
elections in Africa? Growing autocracy [would [do]{.mark} a **grave
[injustice]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [75 percent of
[Africans]{.mark} who **regularly state**]{.underline} that [democracy
is their preferred]{.underline} form of [government]{.underline}. The
[inevitable repression]{.underline} that will result from an unfettered
international order would [also]{.underline} lead to a
[[spike]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[refugee]{.mark} flow[s and]{.mark}
**internally [displaced]{.mark}** [populations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It took the trauma of World War II to compel the international community
to unite, recognize, and sign onto the principles outlined in the U.N.
Charter. Intrinsic to this global system --- forged from hard-learned
and costly experiences --- was the importance of collective security to
deter and push back against authoritarian bullies in Europe and
elsewhere.

The Organisation of African Unity and later the AU adopted many of these
core values. Indeed, drawing on its own hard-earned lessons from
colonialism, the challenges of securing peace following the brutal wars
of the 1990s, and the aftermath of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis,
the AU rightly recognized the importance of action when faced with
violations of such universal principles.

While often underappreciated and unevenly applied, the U.N. and AU
frameworks provide a layer of international accountability against
extralegal actions as well as a critical starting point to build the
solidarity that is needed to address the challenges that the global
community faces.

As Africans grapple with the more present and disastrous aftershocks of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is important to recognize the threat
this form of authoritarian expansion will have on the continent if it is
normalized. [[History shows]{.underline}]{.mark} us that [[impunity is
**contagious**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[apathy]{.mark} in the face of
**imminent threat** [is **foolhardy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [clear
threats emanating from [Putin]{.mark}'s worldview [defy the
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [[**central** to]{.mark} an
international order]{.underline} that both [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.N. and [**[AU]{.mark}** helped foster]{.underline}.

Today's [restrainers]{.underline} similarly seek to [**capitalize**
on]{.underline} the suffering and difficulties associated with [the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}, as well as the broader fight
against terrorism, when they [argue for]{.underline} the [withdrawal
of]{.underline} the [remaining U.S. forces]{.underline} from these and
other conflicts.11 [[Restrainers]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, often
[[conflate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [initial [decision to
intervene]{.mark}]{.underline} at all [[with how]{.mark} a [conflict
is]{.mark} **subsequently [managed]{.mark}**]{.underline} or how
eventually to withdraw. [[These are **different**]{.mark} **policy
[decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[one]{.mark} can be
[critical of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [2003 **invasion of
[Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline} and how the war was managed -- [while [also
believ]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[Washington should
retain]{.underline}]{.mark} a modest [U.S. [military
presence]{.mark}]{.underline} to help prevent a return of the Islamic
State and to counter the influence of Iran.

Restrainers have also attempted to leverage the Great Recession and the
current economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to incite
populist passions.12 They do this by falsely suggesting that defense
spending is the primary source of the federal deficit and debt.13
Defense spending is near post-World War II lows in terms of percentage
of U.S. gross domestic product and percentage of federal spending.

Restrainers consistently paint existing and potential conflicts and U.S.
military deployments with the same brush, warning of another "forever
war."14 However, not every conflict leads to an interminable quagmire.
Even the so-called War on Terror, despite its headaches, so far has
helped prevent another major foreign terrorist attack on the United
States, which many had predicted to be inevitable after 9/11.

The term "forever war" is itself curious. History, unfortunately, is a
forever war --- the chronicle of states' struggles with their enemies.
To be sure, one can write a truly wondrous history of human achievement.
But sadly, as the Spanish writer George Santayana observed, "only the
dead have seen the end of war."15

[Restrainers operate under]{.underline} the [**mistaken
[assertion]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the [[world would be]{.mark} a
[**safer** or **better**]{.mark} place [if U.S.]{.mark} influence would
**simply [recede]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 The [20th [century tells
another story]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the historian Robert Kagan argued
in his 2012 book The World America Made, the [[U.S.-led]{.mark} world
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[heralded]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[global [rise in liberalism]{.mark} and **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}, better [**[education]{.mark}** and
**[health]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[greater
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} more [access
to [information]{.mark}]{.underline}.17

Equally puzzling is the notion that the world's problems and conflicts
are of little consequence to the United States.18 What happens abroad
inevitably affects Americans at home. Al-Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks
despite America's best efforts to steer clear of Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda was and is based. The Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor despite Washington's best efforts to stay out of the fray.
Isolationists initially blocked then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt
from providing greater support to an embattled Britain, and millions of
lives were lost from not confronting German leader Adolf Hitler
sooner.19

The best way to protect American interests is to engage internationally
and maintain a well-designed, forward-deployed military presence
alongside allies and partners. As Jakub J. Grygiel and A. Wess Mitchell
have noted, U.S. deployments of varying magnitude along what they call
the "unquiet frontier" that stretches from the Baltic Sea to the South
China Sea counter the rise of revisionist powers such as China, Russia,
and Iran.20 Support for U.S. allies, coupled with a U.S. military
presence in forward bases, helps deter gathering threats.21

[When Washington plays]{.underline} an [**outsized role** in shaping and
maintaining]{.underline} the [international **rules-based
order**]{.underline}, Americans and [people around the world are safer
and **more prosperous**]{.underline}. That is what the [United States
has done]{.underline}, for the most part, [since World War
II]{.underline}. And that [[leadership]{.mark} role]{.underline} has
helped [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [global
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Cold War [[did not erupt
into]{.mark} **devastating [military
confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Admittedly, the U.S.-led international order certainly has not prevented
all wars. There have been costly mistakes along the way. But
[[responding to]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[mistakes by
ignoring]{.mark} **persistent [threats]{.mark}** [and drawing down
U.S.]{.mark} military [posture]{.mark}]{.underline} for its own sake
would be [[**shortsighted** and **dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Those who welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[retreat]{.mark} of U.S.
power]{.underline} have [[yet to]{.mark} **fully [answer]{.mark}** one
**important [question]{.mark}**[: What happens
after]{.mark}]{.underline} the [United States goes]{.underline} home?
When the British Empire unraveled after World War II, the United States
stepped into the void, promoting an international system based on the
rule of law. Who will follow the United States? The
[[alternatives]{.mark} are [frightening]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is far less equipped to become a
superpower but would be a [**particularly [predatory]{.mark}**[,
**corrupt**, and **avaricious**]{.mark}]{.underline} one
[[under]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its
part, actively seeks global leadership. The [Chinese Communist

[**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights [abuses]{.mark}]{.underline};23

and massive [[theft of **i**]{.mark}ntellectual

a Chinese-led world order. And let us all dispense with the fiction that
the European Union could be an alternative to the United States in
defending democracies.

[The global scope of American military power has been described in many
ways: **[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[primacy]{.underline}**,
[and **unipolarity**]{.underline}. Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth
(2012)1 cover the nuances of the terminology well, and I agree with
their preference for the term "Deep Engagement" that Joseph Nye coined
in a 1995 article.2 [The complex patterns and nuances of engagement
[remain **poorly understood**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a [[focus on
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[ignores the **preponderance of
cases**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[where]{.mark} U.S. [forces have been
**peacefully based**]{.mark} **for decades**]{.underline}. In short,
[foreign [policy]{.mark} has **[focused on the heat instead of]{.mark}
the [light]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [countless [studies]{.mark},
essays, and books [on Vietnam,]{.mark} [Afghanistan, and Iraq]{.mark}
stand [in **contrast** to the **negligible attention** given to]{.mark}
countries where the U.S. maintained large-scale and long-term troop
basing such as **[Belgium]{.mark}**, **[Korea]{.mark}**,
**[Turkey]{.mark}**, [and **Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Is the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[an empire?]{.underline} [We may just as well debate whether an elephant
most closely resembles a]{.underline} **[T]{.underline}**yrannosaurus
**[Rex]{.underline}** [or **Triceratops**]{.underline}. [Some will point
to the imperial characteristics]{.underline} that are [reflected in
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[force posture]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[characteristics
of]{.mark} dinosaurs or [empires]{.mark}]{.underline} (size, martial
strength, breadth) really [[have **no meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in a world where that]{.mark} entire [order is
**extinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **21st century** is filled with a
**new order**]{.underline} [of **nation-states**]{.underline},
[**markedly different** from eras prior to 1945]{.underline}.

**[American power]{.underline}** [is best understood not by its
type]{.underline}: hard, soft, or smart, [but]{.underline} its
**[motivation]{.underline}**. This is not to say the "imperial"
motivation has disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and
domination are instinctive human qualities. But [[there is a **new
aspect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations that has been in place for more than a century, a
form of **[altruism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[illustrated by]{.mark} the
**[widespread support]{.mark}** that exists [in the U.S.]{.mark} and
other countries [for]{.mark} **universal [human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For many decades now,
[nations]{.underline} have routinely sought to [advance something beyond
their narrow national interests]{.underline}. I call this [a
**Promethean motivation**]{.underline}, and America a Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus --- repeatedly --- in order to help uplift the human race.

[[Critics]{.mark} of American intervention [**reflexively** use the
term]{.mark} **["imperial"]{.mark}** when discussing foreign
affairs]{.underline}. By far the dominant theme of imperialism in
American foreign policy has been voiced by Leftist thinkers such as
Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce Kolko, and Gore Vidal. But since 1990,
the end of the Cold War, **[[neo-isolationists]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on the right have [adopted the term as well]{.mark}]{.underline},
notably Pat **[Buchanan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Congressman Ron
**[Paul]{.underline}**. Thus [the tendency is for thinkers on the
**political extremes**]{.underline} --- globalists on the left,
nationalists on the right --- [to find common cause, whereas centrists
tend to view American power more favorably]{.underline}, as do many
foreign scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power." The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." [Hegemony]{.underline} refers to a coercive state, like an
empire, but one that aims to [create **mutually beneficial
relationships**]{.underline}. Trying to define the nature of state power
by the distribution of benefits (exploitative or shared) misses the
point. The point is: what are first principles that motivate foreign
action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. Consider
again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more than a
poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James Madison,
"I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as
ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of his final
letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this progress will
stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding
before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust,
disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
[Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the
advantage]{.underline} of the empire and at the cost of the foreigners.
And for the sake of clarity, recognize a bright line that distinguishes
imperial relationships as those where subjugated peoples do not want but
are forced to abide by foreign intervention. To be specific, [[the U.S.
role in]{.mark} South [Korea **fails the imperial
test**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as does the]{.mark} post-1955
[role]{.mark} of the U.S. [in **Germany** and
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Those]{.mark} three [countries
accounted for]{.mark} nearly [**three-quarters** of U.S]{.mark}. troop
[deployments]{.mark} since 1950]{.underline}. [[Not to mention
**Spain**]{.mark}, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, [**Taiwan**, and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[All]{.mark} of these [are]{.mark}
**[voluntary alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and qualitatively
distinct from forces based in Iraq.

[[For the]{.mark} **Leftist [criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of
American empire [to hold]{.mark}, **[ev]{.mark}**idence [of domination
should be **easy**]{.mark} **to see**]{.underline}. [One would expect to
see the countries of the world that are occupied by American troops
suffering economic decline as a result]{.underline}, or at a minimum a
relative decline. [Here **[the critique falls
apart]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the world [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[hosted]{.mark} the greatest
number of American [troops]{.mark} since 1950 [have **grown the
fastest**]{.mark} **economically**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [host
[countries]{.mark} have [experienced **faster declines in child
mortality**]{.mark}, **faster [increase in]{.mark} overall
[longevity]{.mark}**, **faster [growth in infrastructure]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} even [greater improvements in]{.mark} the broadly measured
human development index (**[HDI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Consider as
evidence the average economic growth rates presented in table 2,
reproduced from Jones and Kane (2012).4

The record shows that [**[America's engagement]{.mark}** with allied
nations [is **unequivocally beneficial**]{.mark} for those
countries]{.underline}. But the context is what matters for future
policy choices. **[Public [perceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** of world
affairs [[are dominated by]{.mark} negatives: [bombings in]{.mark} Iraqi
[cities]{.mark}, AIDS rampant in Africa, genocides,
earthquakes]{.underline}. Foreign policy experts focus on negatives of a
subtler nature: the dilemma over Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, the
poppy trade and corruption in Afghanistan, the strategic mystery that is
China. [**[Yet]{.mark}** despite real and looming crises, the
**underlying [theme]{.mark}** of the American century [is a]{.mark}
**patient [march of human prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [deepening
and [broadening as]{.mark} economic [growth unfolds]{.mark} in the free
world]{.underline}.

[The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S.
troops]{.underline}, even and especially when it is not self-interested,
[has **benefitted our allies and the world**]{.underline}. [America's
engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945 created a security umbrella
fostering **peace** and **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}. [If
this model were applied to the Middle East]{.underline} --- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters --- [it would reshape the region's
future for the better]{.underline}. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[[The question]{.underline}]{.mark} that haunts contemporary foreign
policy [[is **not** whether the U.S.]{.mark} military [is a force for
good]{.mark} around the globe]{.underline}. **[[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The question is: Can]{.mark} Promethean
[power be sustained?]{.mark}]{.underline} Does the United States have
the willpower to maintain a forward force posture?

#### Russia and China's "new world order" would be a nightmare for African decolonial sovereignty.

**Mhaka '22** \-- Johannesburg-based social and political commentator
(Tafi Mhaka, 4-7-2022, \"Russia's new world order is bad news for
Africa,\" Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/4/10/russias-new-world-order-is-bad-news-for-africa,
accessed 7-5-2022) \-- nikki

On March 30, just a day after a Russian missile hit an administrative
building in the port city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, killing at
least 12 people, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the case
for the establishment of new world order. In a videotaped message to his
Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Lavrov claimed the world is "living through
a very serious stage in the history of international relations". He
added, "We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move
towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order". Lavrov's sentiments
echoed [Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi
Jinping's February 4 joint statement announcing the beginning of a new
era in international relations. In that statement, the two leaders not
only called for a new, multipolar order but lamented the West's
"unilateral approaches to addressing international issues", claiming
such attitudes "incite contradictions, differences and confrontation"
and hamper "the development and progress of mankind".]{.underline}
Without a doubt, this is a credible observation, especially regarding
the United States' policies across the world. For example, Washington
has sanctioned Zimbabwe's government -- and rightfully so -- for
committing gross human rights abuses, but continues to support the
equally repressive Ugandan government with military hardware, cash and
training. Last month, the US Senate passed a resolution urging
"international criminal courts to investigate Putin, his security
council and military leaders for possible war crimes" in Ukraine.
Nevertheless, Washington still refuses to recognise the International
Criminal Court (ICC), or cooperate in any way with its investigation
into possible war crimes committed by US troops in Afghanistan. The
hypocrisy of the US is also apparent in its approach to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite Israel's countless,
well-documented human rights and international law violations,
decades-long illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and
apartheid policies against the Palestinian population, the US has
blocked 53 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical
of Israel in the last five decades. And it is not only Russia and China
that are disturbed by the West's apparent hypocrisy in the international
arena. [Africa too has grave concerns about the current global order,
and has long been calling for the UN to undergo substantial reform to
address the deep-rooted injustices in its handling of international
affairs. In]{.underline} 2005, for instance, the African Union (AU)
adopted the Ezulwini Consensus, calling for a more representative and
democratic UNSC, in which Africa, like all other world regions, is
represented. And speaking at the 35th Ordinary Session of the AU
Assembly in February, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed renewed the
call for Africa to be granted a larger role in the UN. [In this context,
it may seem understandable for Africa to support the multipolar world
order Russia claims to be building with the help of China. However,
Beijing and Moscow are not calling for any reform that would diminish
the enormous sway they readily have over world affairs. They are also
not acting in a way that demonstrates under this new order they would
hold themselves to the same standards as everyone else or that less
powerful states and peoples would have better access to justice. Indeed,
as recently as in 2021, China blocked a UN Security Council statement
condemning the military coup in Myanmar. And between 2011 and 2019,
Russia vetoed no less than 14 UNSC resolutions on Syria. These great
powers are evidently selective and casual proponents of democracy and
human rights]{.underline} -- just like their nemesis, the US. [But
African nations now appear hell-bent on ignoring the hypocrisy
demonstrated by Russia and China, and eagerly awaiting the emergence of
their new world order.]{.underline} The dangers of idolising Putin's
Russia, Xi's China [Putin's popularity is at an outstandingly irrational
and possibly dangerous high in Africa. Despite the illegality and
brutality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, Putin's name
adorns long-distance buses in Zimbabwe.]{.underline} And [African
leaders also seem reluctant to punish or even caution the Russian leader
for its destructive "special military operation" in Ukraine. At the
recent UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for Russia's
suspension from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), for example, the
majority of African states either abstained -- such as South Africa --
or outright voted no -- like Ethiopia.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [South
Africa's influential opposition leader Julius Malema has urged Putin to
"teach" Ukraine and NATO a lesson because "we need a new world
orde]{.underline}r". He has also claimed that Putin has given the
Russian army clear instructions to avoid "civilian casualties" in
Ukraine. [This is despite the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights recording 1,900 civilian casualties -- with 726 people
killed, including 52 children -- mostly caused by the use of explosive
weapons in populated areas.]{.underline} In light of the disdain for
territorial integrity, humanity and the right to life Putin's Russia is
currently showing in Ukraine, Africans should stop and think how the
Russian leader's proposed new world order would likely work out for
them. And [it is not only the carnage caused by Russia in Ukraine that
should make Africa think twice about supporting the new world order
promoted by Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline} Under Putin, [Russia has
been inundated by state-affiliated and state-sponsored political filth
and terror. Putin's political rivals and anyone daring to act against
the interests of the Kremlin, including journalists, have faced
assassination attempts both in Russia and abroad.]{.underline} Many,
including former Federal Security Service agent Alexander Litvinenko and
journalist Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed. [Human rights groups
and independent media organisations have been targeted and shut down.
Elections have been turned into a sham and private enterprise has been
all but killed. Under Putin's orders, the Russian military waged many
immoral wars across the world -- Russia's indiscriminate shelling of
residential areas in Syria and Georgia claimed thousands of
lives.]{.underline} Similarly, [China under Xi is a hotbed of
repression. His administration has arbitrarily detained, tortured and
mistreated millions of Turkic Muslims in the northwestern Xinjiang
region. It has also frequently targeted intellectuals, civil rights
activists and journalists and moved to restrict LGBTQ and women's
rights]{.underline}. Thus, [Malema and other African leaders who look
forward to Putin's new world order should stop and consider what they
are wishing for. An illiberal world order led by despots with
blood-soaked histories cannot help Africa fulfil its democratic
aspirations.]{.underline} Africa must chart its own path Africa does not
need to subscribe to Chinese, Russian or American interpretations or
manifestations of democracy and multilateralism. It simply needs to
secure equal rights and representations in a genuinely progressive
multipolar international system that safeguards its democratic and
economic interests as enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the AU. The
ill-advised and misplaced enthusiasm for Putin's strongman politics is a
sombre reflection of Africa's failures and imprecise trajectory under
the toothless AU. Almost 21 years after its establishment, the AU
carries very little weight on the continent and it has almost no voice
on the global stage. And while its pursuit of permanent representation
on the UNSC is an extremely praiseworthy and essential exercise, it has
gradually turned into an expedient and intermittently expressed
soundbite. Be that as it may, [Africa should focus on establishing a
world order that is defined by strong, independent and democratic
multilateral institutions. Undoubtedly, that is what China and Russia
are eager to avoid or destroy, because they want the licence to
intimidate, repress, silence and kill, both at home and
abroad]{.underline}.

[Consistency with influential relevant theories lends
**credence**]{.underline} [to the expectation that **US security
commitments**]{.underline} [actually can shape the strategic environment
as deep engagement presupposes]{.underline}. But it is far from
conclusive. Not all analysts endorse the theories we discussed in
chapter 5. These theories make strong assumptions that states generally
act rationally and focus primarily on security. Allowing misperceptions,
emotions, domestic politics, desire for status, or concern for honor
into the picture might alter the verdict on the strategy's net expected
effects. And [[to model]{.mark} the strategy's expected [effects
we]{.mark} had to [simplify]{.mark} things by selecting two
mechanisms]{.underline}--- [**[assurance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark}--- [and examining
their effects independently, thus missing potentially **powerful
positive interactions** between them.]{.underline}

This chapter moves beyond theory to examine patterns of evidence. If the
theoretical arguments about the security effects of deep engagement are
right, what sort of evidence should we see? Two [major bodies of
evidence are most important]{.underline}: general **[empirical
findings]{.underline}** concerning the strategy's key mechanisms
[and]{.underline} **[regionally focused research]{.underline}**.

General Patterns of Evidence Three key questions about US security
provision have received the most extensive analysis. First, do alliances
such as those sustained by the United States actually deter war and
increase security? Second, does such security provision actually hinder
nuclear proliferation? And third, does limiting proliferation actually
increase security?

Deterrence Effectiveness [The determinants of [deterrence]{.mark}
success and failure have [attracted]{.mark}]{.underline} scores of
quantitative and [case study [tests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the
case study work yields a cautionary finding: that [deterrence is much
harder in practice than in theory]{.underline}, because standard models
assume away the complexities of human psychology and domestic politics
that tend to make some states hard to deter and might cause deterrence
policies to backfire. 1 [Many quantitative
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}, mean- while, [[are]{.mark} mutually
[contradictory]{.mark} or are clearly not relevant to extended
deterrence. But **[some]{.mark} relevant [results receive broad
support]{.mark}:**]{.underline}

- **[[Alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** generally do **[[have a
  deterrent]{.mark} effect]{.underline}**. [[In a study
  spanning]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly **[[two
  centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Johnson]{.underline}**
  [and]{.underline} [**[Leeds]{.underline}** [found "support
  for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the hypothesis that defensive alliances
  deter the **initiation of disputes**]{.underline}." They conclude that
  "[[defensive alliances lower]{.mark} the **probability of
  international [conflict]{.mark}** and are thus a good policy option
  for states seeking to maintain peace]{.underline} in the world."
  Sechser and [Fuhrmann similarly find that formal defense pacts with
  nuclear states]{.underline} have significant deterrence benefits. 2 3

- [The overall balance of military forces]{.underline} (including
  nuclear) between states [does not appear to influence deterrence; the
  **local balance of [military forces ]{.mark}**[in the]{.mark}
  **specific [theater]{.mark}** in [which **deterrence** is]{.mark}
  actually **[practiced]{.mark}**, however, **[is
  key]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4

- **[[Forward- deployed troops enhance the]{.mark} deterrent
  [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** of alliances with overseas allies. 5

- [Strong mutual interests and ties enhance deterrence]{.underline}. 6

- [Case [studies]{.mark} **strongly [ratify]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
  theoretical [expectation]{.mark} that [it is easier to
  **defend**]{.mark} a given status]{.underline} [quo [than]{.mark} to
  **[challenge]{.mark} it forcefully**]{.underline}:
  [compellence]{.underline} (sometimes termed "coercion" or "coercive
  diplomacy") [is extremely hard]{.underline}.

[The most important finding]{.underline} to emerge from this voluminous
research [is that [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}--- especially
[[with]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[- armed
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** [like the United States]{.underline}---
**[actually [work]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in deterring
conflict]{.underline}. This is all the more striking in view of the fact
that what scholars call "[[selection bias]{.underline}"]{.mark} probably
[**[works against it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The **U**nited States is
more inclined to offer]{.underline}--- and protégés to seek--- [alliance
rela- tionships in settings where the **probability** of military
**conflicts** is **higher than average**]{.underline}. [The fact that
alliances work to deter conflict in precisely the situations where
**deterrence** is likely to be **especially hard** is
noteworthy.]{.underline}

More specifically, these findings buttress the key theoretical
implication that if [the United States is interested in deterring
military challenges]{.underline} to the status quo in key regions[,
[relying]{.mark} only [on]{.mark} **[latent]{.mark} military
[capabilities]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} US **[homeland]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} likely to be **far [less effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[than having an **overseas military posture**]{.underline}.
Similarly, they lend support to the general proposition that a [[forward
deterrence]{.mark} posture [is]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[strongly
[appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a status quo power, [[because
defending]{.mark} a given status quo [is]{.mark} **far [cheaper than
overturn]{.mark}ing it**, and, once a favorable status quo is
successfully overturned, **restoring** the status quo ante can be
expected to be **fearsomely costly**]{.underline}. [[Recognizing]{.mark}
the significance of [these **findings**]{.mark} **clearly [casts
doubt]{.mark}** [on the]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[wait on the sidelines
and decide]{.mark} whether [to intervene later"
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is so strongly [favored by
**retrenchment proponents**]{.underline}.

The Causes of Nuclear Proliferation Matthew Kroenig highlights a number
of reasons why US policymakers seek to limit the spread of nuclear
weapons: "[Fear that nuclear proliferation might deter \[US leaders\]
from using military **intervention** to pursue their interests, reduce
the effectiveness of their **coercive diplomacy**, trigger **regional
instability**, undermine their **alliance structures**, dissipate their
strategic attention, and set off **further nuclear proliferation**
within their sphere of influence]{.underline}." These are not the only
reasons for concern about nuclear proliferation; [also notable are the
enhanced prospects of]{.underline} **[nuclear accidents]{.underline}**
[and the greater risk of **leakage** of]{.underline} **[nuclear material
to terrorists]{.underline}**. 9 8

[[Do]{.underline}]{.mark} deep engagement's [[security
ties]{.underline}]{.mark} [serve to [contain]{.mark} t]{.underline}he
spread of **[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**? The literature on
the causes of proliferation is massive and faces challenges as great as
any in international relations. With few cases to study, severe
challenges in gathering evidence about inevitably secretive nuclear
programs, and a large number of factors in play on both the demand and
the supply sides, [**[findings are]{.mark} decidedly [mixed]{.mark}**.
Alliance relationships are just one piece of this complex
puzzle]{.underline}, one that is hard to isolate from all the other
factors in play. And [empirical studies face the same selection bias
problem just discussed]{.underline}: Nuclear powers are more likely to
offer security guarantees to states confronting a serious threat and
thus facing above- average incentives to acquire nuclear weapons.
Indeed, [alliance guarantees might be offered to states actively
considering the nuclear option precisely in order to try to forestall
that decision]{.underline}. Like a strong drug given only to very sick
patients, alliances thus may have a powerful effect even if they
sometimes fail to work as hoped. 10

Bearing these challenges in mind, [[the **most relevant**]{.mark}
findings that emerge **from this literature [are]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

- [The]{.underline} **[most recent [statistical
  analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the precise question at issue
  [[concludes]{.mark} that "[security guarantees]{.mark} **significantly
  [reduce proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [proclivity]{.underline}
  among their recipients." In addition, [[states]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
  such [guarantees are less likely to **export**]{.mark}
  sensitive]{.underline} **[nuclear [material and
  tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** to other nonnuclear states. 12 11

- **[Case study research]{.underline}** [underscores that the complexity
  of motivations for acquiring nuclear weapons cannot be reduced to
  security]{.underline}: domestic politics, economic interests, and
  prestige all matter. 13

- [[Multiple **independent**]{.mark}**ly conceived** and]{.underline}
  **[executed]{.underline}** [recent case [studies]{.mark} nonetheless
  [reveal]{.mark} that **[security alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}
  [help [explain]{.mark} numerous allied [decisions not to
  proliferate]{.mark} even when security is not always the main driver
  of leaders' interest]{.underline} in a nuclear program. As Nuno
  Monteiro and Alexandre Debs stress, "[States whose security goals are
  subsumed by their sponsors' own aims have **never acquired the
  bomb**]{.underline}. ... [This finding highlights the role of U.S.
  security commitments in **stymieing nuclear
  proliferation**]{.underline}: U[.S. [protégés]{.mark} will [only
  **seek the bomb** if they **doubt U.S.
  protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} of their core security goals." 15 14

- **[Multiple independently]{.underline}** conceived and executed recent
  **[case [research]{.mark}]{.underline}** [projects further unpack the
  conditions that decrease the likelihood of allied proliferation,
  [center]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark} the [**credibility** of the **alliance
  commitment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In addition, [in]{.underline}
  some [cases of prevention failure, the alliances allow the patron to
  influence the ally's nuclear program subsequently, decreasing further
  proliferation risks]{.underline}. 17

- [Security [alliances lower]{.mark} the likelihood of **[proliferation
  cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, [many predicted cascades
  did not occur.]{.underline} But [security **[provision]{.mark}**,
  mainly [by the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**[, is a **key**
  reason]{.mark} why]{.underline}. [[The **most comprehensive**]{.mark}
  **statistical [analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[finds]{.mark} that
  [states]{.mark} are more likely to [proliferate]{.mark} in response to
  neighbors [when]{.mark} **three conditions are met**]{.underline}: (1)
  [[there is an **intense**]{.mark} **security [rivalry]{.mark}**
  between the two countries]{.underline}; (2) [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
  prospective [proliferating [state **does not have a security
  guarantee**]{.mark} from a **nuclear**- armed **patron**]{.underline};
  [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (3) [the potential proliferator has the
  industrial and technical [capacity]{.mark} to launch an
  indigenous]{.underline} nuclear [program]{.underline}. 18 19 16

In sum, as Monteiro and Debs note, "Despite grave concerns that more
states would seek a nuclear deterrent to counter U.S. power
preponderance," in fact "[the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
[**decelerated** with the **end of the Cold War**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in 1989." [Their research, as well as that of **[scores of
scholars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[using]{.underline} **[multiple
methods]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and [representing]{.mark} many
**[contrasting]{.mark} theoretical
[perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [shows]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[US]{.mark} **security [guarantees]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the counter-
proliferation policy **[deep engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} [allows
[are]{.mark} a **big part** of the **reason [why]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
20

The Costs of Nuclear Proliferation General empirical findings thus lend
support to the proposition that security alliances impede nuclear
proliferation. But is this a net contributor to global security? Most
practitioners and policy analysts would probably not even bring this up
as a question and would automatically answer yes if it were raised. Yet
a small but very prominent group of theorists within the academy reach a
different answer: [some of the same realist precepts that generate the
theoretical prediction that retrenchment would increase demand for
nuclear weapons also suggest that proliferation might **increase
security**]{.underline} such that the net effect of retrenchment could
be neutral. Most notably, "**[nuclear optimists]{.underline}**"
[like]{.underline} Kenneth **[Waltz]{.underline}** [contend that
**deterrence** essentially solves the security problem for all
**nuclear- armed states**]{.underline}, [largely eliminating the direct
use of force]{.underline} among them. It follows that [US retrenchment
might generate an initial decrease in security followed by an **increase
as insecure states acquire nuclear capabilities**]{.underline},
[ultimately leaving no net effect on international
security]{.underline}. 21

[This perspective is countered by]{.underline} "**[nuclear
[pessimists]{.mark}]{.underline}**" such as Scott Sagan. Reaching
outside realism to organization theory and other bodies of social
science research, [they [see major]{.mark} security [downsides]{.mark}
from **new nuclear states**. **Copious [research]{.mark}**]{.underline}
produced by Sagan and others [[casts doubt]{.mark} on the expectation
that [**governments** can be **relied upon**]{.mark} to create
**secure** and **controlled** **nuclear forces**. The more nuclear
states there are, the higher the probability that the organizational,
psychological, and civil- military pathologies Sagan identifies will
turn an episode like one of the numerous "**near misses" he
uncovers**]{.underline} into actual nuclear use. As Campbell Craig
warns, "[One day a **[warning system]{.mark} will
[fail]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or **[[an]{.mark} [official will
panic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [or a terrorist **[attack will be
misconstrued]{.mark}**, and **the [missiles will
fly]{.mark}**.]{.underline}" 22 23

Looking beyond these kinds of factors, it is notable that [powerful
reasons to question the assessment of proliferation optimists also
emerge even if one assumes, as they do, that states are rational and
seek only to maximize their security]{.underline}. First, [nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} can [only work by **raising the risk of
nuclear**]{.mark} **[war]{.mark}**. For deterrence to be
**credible**]{.underline}, [there has to be a]{.underline} [**nonzero
chance** of nuclear use]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} nuclear [use is
**impossible**, **deterrence cannot be credible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It follows that [every nuclear deterrence relationship depends on some
probability]{.underline} of 24 nuclear use. [[The more]{.mark} such
relationships there are]{.underline}, **[[the greater the risk]{.mark}
of nuclear war]{.underline}**. Proliferation therefore increases the
chances of nuclear war even in a perfectly rationalist world.
Proliferation optimists cannot logically deny that nuclear spread
increases the risk of nuclear war. Their argument must be that the
security gains of nuclear spread outweigh this enhanced risk.

Estimating that risk is not simply a matter of pondering the conditions
under which leaders will choose to unleash nuclear war. Rather, as
Schelling established, the question is whether states will run the risk
of using nuclear weapons. [Nuclear [crisis]{.mark} bargaining
[is]{.mark} about [a "**competition in risk
taking**]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Kroenig counts some twenty cases in
which states]{.underline}---including prominently the United
States---[ran real risks of nuclear war in order to prevail in
crises]{.underline}. As Kroenig notes[, "By asking whether states can be
deterred or not ... proliferation optimists are **asking the wrong
question**.]{.underline} [The right question to ask is: **what risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline} [is a specific state willing to run against a
**particular opponent** in a]{.underline} **[given
crisis]{.underline}**?" [[The more]{.mark} nuclear- [armed
states]{.mark} there are, the more the opportunities for such risk-
taking and [the **greater the probability**]{.mark} **of nuclear
use**]{.underline}. 27 26 25

//CHC-DS

That Africa is the first among the world's regions to feel the
devastating human effects of climate change is now widely acknowledged.
[Arguably more significant than the]{.underline} **[economic
boons]{.underline}** [Russia stands to realize]{.underline} from the
aforementioned deals [are the adverse environmental effects that
resource mining could have on the populations of these
countries]{.underline}.

Putin's promise to help bring stability to the Central African Republic
also invites a human approach to the analysis of Russia's Africa policy.
According to the UN, the protracted conflict has displaced more than
642,000 people. During the past year, [the actions of Putin's
associate]{.underline} Yevgeny Prigozhin and Prigozhin's **[private
military company]{.underline}**, [Wagner Group, in the CAR have faced
increasing scrutiny]{.underline}. Columbia University professor Kimberly
Marten, for example, has [highlighted the group's]{.underline}
**[mercenary interests]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[CAR's]{.underline}** [mineral-rich]{.underline}
**[mines]{.underline}**. [Discerning]{.underline} exactly [what Putin's
promise entails therefore has a particular]{.underline} **[humanitarian
urgency]{.underline}**.

Foreign policy and domestic policy are inextricably connected. For this
reason, it is important also to examine the impact of foreign policy on
domestic social attitudes. [Russia has a]{.underline} **[notoriously
poor record on racism]{.underline}**, [particularly when it comes
to]{.underline} **[African migrants]{.underline}**, as the Los Angeles
Times highlighted back in 2014. Since the country hosted the FIFA World
Cup in 2018, [these problems have been]{.underline}
**[exacerbated]{.underline}** [by the presence of many Africans who
outstayed their Fan Visas in hope of seeking asylum or finding
work]{.underline}. In March of this year, Interior Ministry official
Andrei Krayushkin confirmed that [5,500 of these individuals remained in
Russia]{.underline}.

[Mixed race]{.underline} **[African Russians]{.underline}** [also
continue to face]{.underline} **[discrimination and
abuse]{.underline}**, as this Calvert Journal report shows. In the case
of Russia's "pivot to the East," official foreign policy has fostered
positive attitudes among the Russian population toward China and its
people. [To what extent the Kremlin's pivot to Africa will have an
analogous effect remains to be seen, but attention should be paid to
whether Putin's overtures to African leaders have any tangible effect on
the lives of Russia's own African population.]{.underline}

[Africa is not]{.underline}, as Belgium's King Leopold contemptuously
called it, [a "magnificent cake" that exists purely to sate the
appetites of great powers---**Russia among them**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it is an umbrella term that includes a plethora of independent actors
with their own agendas distinct from those of Moscow]{.underline},
Beijing, or indeed Washington. As the South China Morning Post recently
reported, **[Russia is playing catch-up]{.underline}** to China and the
West [in terms of developing economic ties with the
continent]{.underline}. With African nations---and the continent as a
whole---in ascendance on the international stage, it is time to rethink
the way we analyze great powers' Africa policies. And Russia's policy is
a good place to start.

#### Russia will [interfere]{.underline} with African elections to support [unstable autocracies]{.underline}.

**Gathara 19**, Communications consultant, writer, and award-winning

//CHC-DS

However, as it seeks to reassert itself on the world stage, [Africa is
still seen as providing "low-cost, high-profile" opportunities to
burnish its prestige]{.underline}.

Still, the Africa of today is very different from that of the 1970s and
1980s and while maintaining some of the tactics that were successful in
yesteryears, such as the use of proxy forces in places like the Central
African Republic and the sale of light and heavy weapons to regimes with
dubious human rights records, [Russia has evolved others more in tune
with the times]{.underline}.

According to Proekt (The Project), an independent Moscow-based online
investigative news outlet, [Kremlin-linked teams have used social
media]{.underline} **["troll farms"]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[spin doctors]{.underline}** [to interfere in politics and elections
in 20 countries on the continent,]{.underline} particularly in
Francophone Africa, but with mixed success so far. In 2018 [they failed
in their attempt to]{.underline} **[engineer]{.underline}** [the
re-election of President Erie Radzaunarimampianina in Madagascar and
have been linked to **interference** in elections in
Zimbabwe.]{.underline}

According to the Financial Times "[across Africa, Moscow has deployed
teams of]{.underline} **[military instructors]{.underline}** [to train
elite presidential guards, sent arms shipments and]{.underline}
**[assisted shaky autocrats]{.underline}** [with election
strategies]{.underline}. It has also promised to build nuclear power
plants and develop oil wells and diamond mines."

The Guardian has also reported on leaked [documents show]{.underline}ing
[a]{.underline} **[wide-scale Russian effort]{.underline}** "[to bolster
its presence in at least 13 countries across Africa by]{.underline}
building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and
[grooming a new generation of 'leaders' and **undercover
'agents'**]{.underline}."

The goal of Russian efforts seems largely unchanged from the Soviet days
-- essentially to counter and limit the influence of others on the
continent. [The benefits for autocrats seeking to hang on to power on
the continent is]{.underline} similarly [easy to ascertain]{.underline}.
However, for their youthful subjects, many of whom have little
experience or recollection of the Soviet Union, the renewed Russian
interest is likely to be viewed with scepticism.

Russia's interest in Africa

It will be simplistic to frame the just-concluded Russia-Africa summit
as a copy-cat jamboree organized by Russia to latch on the bandwagon of
the increasingly fashionable trend of organizing and institutionalizing
Africa summits by countries like China, India, Japan, France, and the
United States. The truth is that, si[nce the 2000s, there has been a
noticeable **re-awakening** of Russia's interest in Africa]{.underline}.
Indeed, [between 2005 and 2015, Africa's trade with Russia grew by 185
percent,]{.underline} and [Russia has]{.underline} **[several
reasons]{.underline}** [to engage Africa more intensely]{.underline}.

Goal 1: [Projecting power on the global stage]{.underline}

In supporting African countries---who, notably, constitute the largest
voting bloc in the United Nations---[Russia is cultivating allies in its
challenge to the current United States and Euro-Atlantic-dominated
security order]{.underline}. This strategy is not going unnoticed:
Indeed, in 2018 former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton
accused Russia of [selling arms to African countries in exchange for
votes at the United Nations, among other nefarious
motivations]{.underline}.

Goal 2: [Accessing]{.underline} **[raw materials]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[natural resources]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**---just like other major world powers---also
**[covets]{.underline}** [many of Africa's raw materials and is creating
joint projects and investments in order to access them]{.underline}.
From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Central African
Republic, [Russian companies are]{.underline} **[scaling
up]{.underline}** their [activities in the mining of resources such as
coltan, cobalt, gold, and diamonds]{.underline}. In Zimbabwe, for
instance, a joint venture between Russia's JSC Afromet and Zimbabwe's
Pen East Ltd is [developing one of the **world's largest** deposits of
platinum group metal]{.underline}. In Angola, [Russian mining company
Alroser recently increased its stake in local producer Catoca to 41
percent]{.underline}, in a deal that provides the diamond giant with a
production base outside Russia. Despite joint ownership with Angola,
[Catoca operates **under Russian management**]{.underline}. Remarkably,
about one-third of Russia's African imports are agricultural, including
fruit, cocoa, coffee, and potatoes.

Goal 3: Arms exports and security

In recent years, Russia had become the largest supplier of arms to
Africa, accounting for 35 percent of arms exports to the region,
followed by China (17 percent), United States (9.6 percent), and France
(6.9 percent). Since 2015, Russia has signed over 20 bilateral military
cooperation agreements with African states. A Russian citizen, Valeriy
Zakharov, has even been appointed to be a national security advisor to
the president of the Central African Republic (CAR), Faustin-Archange
Touadéra.

[Russian arms are attractive to African leaders because]{.underline},
besides being relatively cheap, [deals with Russia are
**not**]{.underline} often **[held up by human rights
concerns]{.underline}** [cited by other countries like France and the
U.S.]{.underline} For instance, when the U.S. was dilly-dallying on
selling arms to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram in 2014 upon allegations of
human rights abuses by Nigerian soldiers, Nigeria turned to Russia and
was able to place an order for 12 attack helicopters.

Goal 4: [Supporting energy and power development in Africa through
Russian companies]{.underline}

[Lack of]{.underline} affordable, [reliable electricity in Africa makes
the region a prime and]{.underline} **[lucrative location]{.underline}**
[for Russia's energy and power industry]{.underline}. Several
state-owned Russian companies such as **[Gazprom]{.underline}**,
**[Lukoil]{.underline}**, **[Rostec and Rosatom]{.underline}** [are
active in Africa]{.underline}, with activities largely concentrated in
Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, and Uganda. So far, Rosatom has signed
memorandums and agreements to develop nuclear energy with 18 African
countries, including Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda, Nigeria, and
Ethiopia. In 2018 alone, Rosatom agreed to build four 1200 MW VVER-type
nuclear reactors in Egypt---with construction and maintenance valued at
\$60 billion---with a Russian loan of up to \$25 billion at an annual
interest rate of 3 percent.

[Russia]{.underline} also [wants to use its mostly state-owned oil and
gas companies to create]{.underline} **[new streams of energy
supply]{.underline}**. In 2018, for instance, [Nigerian oil and gas
exploration company Oranto Petroleum announced that it would be
cooperating with Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, to develop **21
oil assets** across 17 African countries]{.underline}. [Several Russian
companies have also made significant investments in Algeria's oil and
gas industries and in Libya, Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and
Egypt]{.underline}.

In [contemporary debates, this argument undercuts]{.underline},
modifies, and qualifies [characterizations]{.underline} held by so many
[of the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates as essentially
imperial]{.underline}, and the American order as an empire. In our
rendering, the [**U**nited **S**tate]{.underline} is [[not]{.mark} the
last [**Western empire**, but the first **anti-imperial**]{.mark} and
**post-imperial [great power]{.mark}** [in the **global
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our argument is thus focused on the
consequences of American foreign policy for the evolution of the
international system, and we do not in this confined treatment offer an
explanation for the origins of U.S. foreign policy. In short, we offer
an argument about impacts rather than the sources of America's
antiimperial and pro-Westphalian role.

Empires and State Systems: Historical Patterns

Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world
politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no
global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent
imperial and colonial ventures connected desperate regional systems,
doing so approximately five hundred years ago.7 Prior to this emergence
of a globalscope system, the pattern of world politics was characterized
by regional systems. These regional systems were initially very
anarchic, and marked by high levels of military competition. But almost
universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires which had
fairly limited interactions with polities outside their regions.8 Thus,
it was empires -- not anarchic state systems -- that typically dominated
the regional systems in all parts of the world.

Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order
was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.
Despite repeated efforts to consolidate Europe into one empire -- or
what the Europeans referred to as "universal monarchy" -- this region
remained a plural, multi-state political order. After the Peace of
Westphalia ending the Thirties Year War, this plural anarchic system,
the Westphalian system, and was sustained by a rough balance of power
among its autonomous states and the weakness of the claimants of
European empire. This Westphalian system was based on a roughly equal
distribution of power among its major units, sustained by various
balancing practices that thwarted a succession of regional European
empire-builders, and had an elaborate system of public international law
and ideological justification.9 While this system rested on a balance of
power, it was juridically crystallized into a system of mutually
recognized sovereigns.

Outside of Europe, however, the European states, including those that
were most active in preventing empire within Europe, were
extraordinarily successful in conquering and colonizing vast areas
across oceanic distances.10 The Europeans did not invent empire, but
they were spectacularly successful at empire building on a global scope,
largely because of the imbalance of power that stemmed from European
innovations in technology and organization.11 The Europeans conquered
and dominated empires, states, and peoples in every previously loosely
coupled or isolated regional system across the world. The Europeans also
successfully planted numerous colonies of settlers, mainly in the
temperate zones in North and South America, Oceania, and the southern
tip of Africa.12 States from the Western European core of the
Westphalian system thus brought into existence a global-scale political
system made up of vast multi-continental empires of conquered peoples
and a scattering of colonial "new Europes."13

This pattern of European empire building was different from its
predecessors, not just in its global scope, but also because the
European states were continuously warring against one another for
dominance within Europe. These struggles between states within Europe
against empire in Europe were fought on a global scale. Thus the first
"world war," defined as a war fought across multiple continents,
occurred in the later 18th century. In this struggle Britain sought to
thwart French attempts to dominate Europe and the battle lines were in
Europe, North America, South Asia, and across the global oceans. This
pattern of the globalization of intraEuropean warfare continued in the
20th century with the wars triggered by German efforts to dominate
Europe. The growing imbalance of power between the Europeans and the
rest of the world during the 18th and 19th century enabled the Europeans
to easily expand their empires at the expense of non-Europeans. But
during the same periods, the Europeans found it very difficult to
conquer each other within Europe. Thus vast armies wrought great
destruction fighting over tiny parcels of land in Europe, while
comparatively small European imperial expeditionary forces readily
mastered non-European armies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Thus a
balance of power underpinned the Westphalian system in Europe, while an
imbalance of power between Europe and the world underpinned imperial
expansion.

Anti-imperial and anti-colonial rebellions and resistance are as old as
empires, but successful rebellion against European imperial rule outside
Europe began in the 18th century with the revolt of the colonial settler
colonies in the Americas -- first in North America and then in South
America. This first wave of settler-colony rebellion marked the end of
what historians refer to as the "first British empire," as well as the
first great European empire in the Americas, that of Spain. The success
of this first wave of anti-imperial rebellion in Spanish America was
crucially facilitated by the weakening of Spain during the Napoleonic
wars for domination within Europe.

In the later-19th century, European empire building outside of Europe
entered a second wave, enabled by the new industrial technologies that
further amplified the imbalance of power between Europeans and
non-Europeans, which in turn allowed the Europeans to extend their
imperial domination into the large interior spaces of the continents,
particularly in Africa and Asia.14 In the 20th century, further wars
among the core European states weakened Britain, France, and Holland,
the leading European colonial powers, thus creating opportunities for
antiimperial independence movements in Asia and Africa. Paradoxically,
the fact that the Europeans were continuously fighting one another
fueled their imperial ambitions and successes, while at the same time,
such wars weakened them and helped enable the success of rebellions
against their empires.15 Thus as the British empire was reaching its
territorial zenith in the early years of the 20th century, Britain was
critically weakened by the world wars in Europe and Asia against the
aspiring German and Japanese empire builders.

The territorial aggression of the Axis Powers constitute a third wave of
empire building which was short lived and thwarted by the successful
mobilization of the "United Nations," a coalition led by the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. A fourth wave of
empire building, by the Soviet Union and the international communist
movement in the second half of the 20th century, was thwarted and
dismantled by the United States and its allies.

The Pattern of American Anti-Imperial, Anti-Colonial, and
Pro-Westphalian Impacts

[[Against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [backdrop of]{.underline} this
[evolution of the international system and]{.underline} the [four [waves
of **empire** building]{.mark} and dismantlement]{.underline}, it
becomes possible to [see **more [clearly]{.mark}** the many
ways]{.underline} in which [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[played]{.mark} **important [anti-imperial]{.mark}**[,
anti-colonial]{.mark}]{.underline}, and pro-Westphalian
[[roles]{.underline}]{.mark}. 16

In each of the four waves of empire building and dismantlement, the
United States had an impact. The [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} was the [first]{.underline} "**[new
nation]{.underline}**" [to emerge from]{.underline} a
[**[rebel]{.mark}**lion [against]{.mark} European [imperial
rule]{.mark}]{.underline} during the first wave of modern empire. The
[United States]{.underline} also [[supported]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[independence of]{.underline} other [European settler
colonies]{.underline} throughout the Americas [and]{.underline}, with
the [Monroe Doctrine]{.underline}, helped [**sustain their
[independence]{.mark}** [against European efforts to
**recolonize**]{.mark}]{.underline} parts of the [Americas]{.underline}.
In the second wave of late 19th century empire-building, the [United
States]{.underline}, despite its great relative power, [[did not
establish]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[empire]{.mark} of its
own]{.underline} of any significance or duration. [And]{.underline}
during the latter part of the 20th century, the United States
[[pushed]{.mark} **European [decolonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus
[facilitating]{.underline} the [breakup of second wave empires.
In]{.underline} the [great world wars]{.underline} in the 20th century,
the [United States played]{.underline} an [**important role** in
[thwarting]{.mark}]{.underline} a third [**wave of [imperial
projects]{.mark}** [of **Germany**, **Japan**, and
**Italy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the second half of the 20th century,
the United States played decisive roles, both ideological and military,
in thwarting the fourth wave of empire building, the expansion of the
communist great power, the Soviet Union, as well as communist coups and
revolutions in many weak and small independent states.

The United States [[also]{.mark} played]{.underline} a [variety of
important roles in **[building]{.mark} and strengthening**]{.underline}
Westphalian [[institutions, moderating]{.mark} **inter-state
[anarchy]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} facilitating]{.underline} the [[ability
of states to survive as **independent**]{.mark} **members** of
international society]{.underline}. From its inception, the [United
States]{.underline} was [precocious in]{.underline} its [support
for]{.underline} the [law of nations]{.underline}, the [institutions
of]{.underline} the [society of states]{.underline}, particularly the
[laws of]{.underline} war and neutrality, and public international law,
as a means of [[restraining war and aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
both the 19th and 20th centuries, the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, first regionally and then [[globally,
inspired]{.underline}]{.mark} and helped [**legitimate
[anti-colonial]{.mark}** [and anti-imperial **independence
movements**]{.mark} and]{.underline} national [liberation
struggles]{.underline} among [peoples struggling [against
empires]{.mark} all over the world]{.underline}. In the 20th century,
the [United States]{.underline} led the efforts to
[institutionalize]{.underline} Westphalian [norms of non-aggression
and]{.underline} sovereign [independence]{.underline}, first with the
League of Nations and then with the United Nations Charter. In the
second half of the 20th century, the [American]{.underline}-led [liberal
international order institutionalized **free trade** and **[multilateral
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus providing the infrastructure
for a global economic system, thus [[enabl]{.mark}ing
**[smaller]{.mark}**]{.underline} and weaker [[**states** to sustain
their sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also in the second half of the
20th century, the [American]{.underline} system of [military
[alliances]{.mark} contributed to]{.underline} the [dampening of violent
conflicts]{.underline} among allied states, particularly in Europe and
East Asia, thus [[protecting]{.mark} the]{.underline} Westphalian
[[system from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [return of [violent conflict and
empire-building]{.mark}]{.underline}.
