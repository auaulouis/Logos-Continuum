### AT: Reasonability

#### Their model of reasonability is [untenable]{.underline}---it amounts to "our interps are reasonable if we say so," which makes the topic an [unlimited free-for-all]{.underline} and solves [neither side's offense]{.underline}. Competing interpretations is the best guide to [making a fair decision]{.underline} with incomplete information.

Journalism (Ejvind, "Aporias of courage and the freedom of expression,"
Philosophy & Social Criticism, Vol 44, Issue 1, 2018, dml) \[language

In order for a practice to be courageous [there needs to be some kind of
**goal**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, furthermore, [some kind of
**connection** between the **goal** and the **practice**]{.underline}.
This is admittedly still pretty vague. [Insofar as we
**define**]{.underline} courage as [a]{.underline} challenging
[practice]{.underline} in which we risk our lives in order [to
**reasonably further** some kind of goal]{.underline}, [we have reached
a **definition** with elements]{.underline} ('risk', 'lives',
'reasonably' 'further', 'some kind of goal') [that are very open to
**differing views**]{.underline}.

On the one hand, this is certainly as it has to be. If we are to
articulate a positive supplement to the negative definitions of the
freedom of expression, it must be very open, because it should be open
to the improvisational and disruptive impulses of courage. As soon as we
start to define the goals and the ways of reaching them too strictly,
these very definitions might themselves become objects of challenge
through the aporias of courage.

On the other hand, [even though the]{.underline} positive [freedom we
are seeking to instantiate is open to differing views]{.underline},
[this **does not mean** that we might as well **do without
it**]{.underline} -- especially not [when we are talking about
communicative expressions]{.underline}. It draws on the intuition that
life at the outset is the prime value, and if you risk your life [you
are]{.underline} thus [**expected** to be able to say something about
**why** this]{.underline} sacrifice [is necessary]{.underline}. [The
agent]{.underline} who risks her or his life **[always has the burden of
proof]{.underline}**.

Certainly, what is taken to be necessary may vary almost endlessly. That
cannot be determined in advance, once and for all. But an agent who
risks her or his life [without being able to give some account of
**why**]{.underline}, is foolhardy -- and [the chances that]{.underline}
she or he \[[they]{.underline}\] in some sense [will be **taken
seriously** is **minimal**]{.underline}.

With this last move, we are, as premised above, closing in on a
deliberative approach (as articulated in Cohen, 1989, 1997; Habermas,
1981, 1992, 1996; Rawls, 1999\[1971\]), something that may seem
surprising given the French inspiration of the previous sections.
Knowing Habermas' hostility towards the anti-rational impulses in these
positions (Habermas, 1985) on the one hand, and Derrida's hesitation on
linguistic generality (cf. the previous sections) on the other hand,
this calls for some comments.

We are not going to claim that the Habermasian and Derridean approaches
could be reconciled. In previous writings we have, however, argued that
Habermas' deliberative approach and the world-disclosing approaches (in
this article: Foucault and Derrida) articulate two different (and to
some extent opposing) impulses in our social, political and
communicative practices: the impulses of systematicity (attempting to
bring together seemingly disparate phenomena) and the quest for adequacy
(attempting to understand phenomena in their entire diversity) (e.g. in
Hansen, 2005a, 2005b, 2013).

As shown above, Derrida's deconstructive approach can certainly be seen
as an attempt to reveal [the necessary **gaps** and **aporias** embodied
in]{.underline} the generalizing aspects in [argumentative
deliberation]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the findings of
his analyses [do **not** lead to a **refusal** of]{.underline} the
[generalizing approaches as such]{.underline}:

[The undecidable is not merely the]{.underline} oscillation or the
[tension between two decisions]{.underline}; [it is the
experience]{.underline} of that which, though heterogeneous, foreign to
the order of the calculable and the rule, is still obliged -- it is [of
**obligation**]{.underline} that we must speak -- [to
**give**]{.underline} itself up to **[the impossible
decision]{.underline}**, [while **taking account of law** and
**rules**]{.underline}. (Derrida, 1994: 539; emphases added)

Even though Derrida in the above quote is reflecting upon the
undecidable and the moment of freedom he still acknowledges that [the
resulting decision **needs to take account** of laws and
rules]{.underline}. Derrida is very clear that true [decisions are **not
determined** by existing rules and laws]{.underline}, [but **at the same
time**]{.underline}, however, [neither are they **entirely
independent**]{.underline} of rules and laws.

Habermas and Derrida certainly disagree in their analyses of how rules
and laws are (should be) established -- Derrida focusing on emergence
through continuous challenges, Habermas focusing on the deliberative and
argumentative trying to overcome mutual disagreements. Habermas' account
has its limits when it comes to articulating reasonable resentments
towards existing discursive structures (this is an often raised
criticism of Habermas' approach -- see, for example, in Thomassen,
2007), Derrida's approach is lacking in reflections on the forces or
mechanisms that bring back new accounts of the general: how and why do
new rules, laws and accounts of courage come about?

Both positions are (if not in their full articulations then at least in
their founding intuitions) in fact right. [In order]{.underline} for
deconstruction [not to become **merely destructive**]{.underline}, [we
need to understand how reason in communication plays the role of helping
agents to **reach reasonably** towards each other]{.underline}.
[Otherwise public discussions will tend to **dissolve** into an
**infinite ocean of unconnected conversations**]{.underline}; [**any
point of view** will appear as **equally valid**]{.underline}; [**any
decision** will be prevented by the **persistent possibility of raising
counter-voices** by minority groups]{.underline}. [Deliberation is the
responsibility of trying to **reach common understandings** in spite of
initial disagreements]{.underline}. This is where Habermas is right. On
the other hand, in order for such reasonable accounts not to freeze into
dogma, we need (courageous) [**challenges** of the very accounts of
**reasonability**]{.underline}. This is where world-disclosing
approaches as suggested by Foucault and Derrida are at their strongest.

However, having seen that every human practice is embedded in aporetic
paradoxes, it should not come as a surprise that even reason is
aporetically structured: seeking deliberative consensus is a legitimate
aim only insofar as the exchanged arguments seek to include courageous
challenges (possible disturbances of consensus) of the discursive
horizons, just as we have seen that notions of courage [make sense
**only** through]{.underline} some [**deliberative reflections** of our
**means** and **goals**]{.underline}.

VII

[The quest for a **reasonable account**]{.underline} of the necessity of
change [does **not** imply that]{.underline} (1) [an act without such
accounts is **by itself illegitimate**]{.underline} -- sometimes we do
things without any reason or clear ideas of what we try to accomplish
that turn out to be of value nevertheless. [But in public exchanges
where we want to **affect others**]{.underline}, [the others should **in
some way come to understand** why change is necessary]{.underline}.

Neither do we want to imply that (2) changes may never come about
without agents being able themselves to give an account of why this is
necessary. Quite often actions and events are conceived in ways that the
initiators did not foresee.

What we are trying to argue here is thus not that the suggested
reflections on positive freedom of expression should replace prevailing
accounts of negative freedom. It may be argued that a freedom of
expression that is only thought through negative accounts of freedom is
problematic, but that is quite another argument and it is not implied by
the above reflections. The reflections merely suggest that [in
**evaluations** of actual public spheres it is **inadequate** merely to
consider the **plurality** of voices]{.underline} (as suggested in the
negatively conceived accounts of the freedom of expression).

This is where we suggest turning our attention towards notions of
courage. [If our **bandwidth of attention** is **limited**]{.underline},
[it is **important** that we]{.underline} in our engagements in the
public spheres [are **not overwhelmed** by **insignificant utterances
that merely affirm existing states of affairs**]{.underline}. For public
deliberation to become democratically fruitful [it is important that we
are attentive to]{.underline} courageously challenging
[statements]{.underline}; challenges [that are]{.underline}, certainly,
[**made comprehensible** to us by the speakers' attempts to **convince
us** of the underlying goals and means]{.underline}.

Certainly, [if these reflections are to **gain any real relevance** they
will need to be **further articulated**]{.underline}, and in such
articulations [it will be **necessary** to **substantiate notions
of**]{.underline} 'life', '**[reasonably]{.underline}**', 'some kind of
goal', etc. And [these]{.underline} substantiations [might **narrow**
the plurality of voices heard]{.underline} in the public.

As demonstrated in the previous sections [the alternative]{.underline}
to doing this [is]{.underline}, however, [**not to make every voice
visible** in the public spheres]{.underline}. [Even though they may
exist]{.underline} in the public sphere, [it is **not certain** that the
limited bandwidth of attention leaves room for their **actually being
heard**]{.underline} by any critical mass.

Insofar as we consider the public spheres not merely as spheres in which
voices should be uttered but also as spheres in which voices should be
heard, [we need some way to **select out** those voices from the chorus
that are **significant in relation to some given context**]{.underline}.
[Unlimited plurality is **not an option**]{.underline}. [The
question]{.underline} thus [becomes **how** plurality should be
**limited**]{.underline}. [Should plurality be limited according to
**explicitly articulated rules** and **norms**]{.underline}, rules and
norms [that can]{.underline}, [due to their **explicit
articulations**]{.underline}, [themselves become **subjects of
dispute**?]{.underline} [Or should plurality be limited according to
**unconscious power structures**]{.underline}, [the rules of the
**strongest**?]{.underline}
