## How to Use this File

#### This file presents multiple different scenarios for Russian influence being good around the globe. Each DA argues that the plan's increase in NATO cohesion/strength/unity trades off with the motivations behind \[x\] country/region relations with Russia which is bad. 

#### The best way to use this file is to [pick a region]{.underline} and [use that section of the file]{.underline} for execution of the DA. There are *[7 unique]{.underline}* relations scenarios for you to choose from. The "generic link" at the top of the file can be used with all of the scenarios.

As [the West **scrambles** to maintain its united front against Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, the European Union (EU) member states
of **[Central]{.underline}** and Eastern **[Europe]{.underline}** have
[**led** the way]{.underline} as [some of the continent's loudest moral
voices, sending **arms** and **humanitarian** **aid** to Ukraine while
receiving **streams** of **refugees**.]{.underline}

But while neighboring [Poland has]{.underline} perhaps [been most
visible]{.underline}---[hosting]{.underline} both US President Joe
[Biden and]{.underline} Vice President Kamala [Harris]{.underline} in
recent weeks [while absorbing more than **two million
refugees**]{.underline}---geography isn't the only factor that
determines who is a frontline state.

Take [the **Czech Republic**]{.underline}, for example: [Though nestled
in the heart of Europe and away from the EU's eastern
border]{.underline}, its new government---[together with the three
Baltic countries, **Poland**, and the United
Kingdom]{.underline}---[**spearheaded** **weapons** **delivery** for
Ukrainians when most EU member states were still **hesitating**. It is
also now home to around **200,000 Ukrainian refugees**]{.underline}.

So when Prime Minister Petr Fiala---along with his Polish and Slovenian
counterparts, Mateusz Morawiecki and Janez Jan코a,
respectively---traveled to Kyiv earlier this month to visit Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it wasn't just a powerful symbolic
gesture[. It was also a reflection of the region's **growing clout** as
a bridge between **Brussels** and **Kyiv**.]{.underline}

I spoke to Tom치코 Pojar, Fiala's chief foreign-affairs adviser, who
accompanied the delegation to Kyiv. Below are six major takeaways I
distilled from our conversation---which can be also read as a guideline
for Europe's next steps for engagement toward Ukraine.

Europe's most important task is to continue providing Ukraine with
military support, especially anti-tank and -aircraft weapons. Quantity
and time matter here, and the coming weeks are likely to be decisive in
the war. Ukrainians are committed, but can't defeat the Russian military
without Western support. [Moscow needs to understand that **Europe**
stands firmly behind **Ukraine**, ready to provide what is needed to
wreck Russian President Vladimir **Putin's plans**]{.underline}. If
[Ukraine]{.underline} is properly equipped with more anti-aircraft
weaponry, it [can]{.underline} even [create something akin to its own
version of a no-fly zone (without]{.underline}, of course, achieving
[NATO-aided air superiority]{.underline}). Indeed, something similar is
already happening in parts of the country's airspace, where [**Russian
planes** and **helicopters** dare not enter]{.underline}. Military
support is critical to any prospects for meaningful negotiation; [if
Putin sees the West hesitating, he is likely to press his advantage on
the battlefield for quite some time]{.underline}.

Europe must also continue pushing for stronger sanctions against the
Kremlin, as [efforts]{.underline} thus far [seem]{.underline} to be
[quite effective]{.underline}. There are [many options still available
to the EU]{.underline}---not least in the field of energy---but as some
member states call for restraint, [the immediate task is to close
loopholes, such as]{.underline} those [facilitating sanctions evasion
through third-party entities]{.underline}. And if needed, [a sixth or
even seventh sanctions package should be on the table]{.underline}. The
key is to [remember that continuing to do **business** with **Russia**
enables]{.underline} the [Kremlin to **finance** its war]{.underline},
thus creating a further burden that Europe will need to carry in the
future---from accepting more refugees to paying for the stabilization
and reconstruction of a devastated Ukraine.

Ukraine needs a plan to rebuild. Beyond the immediate humanitarian needs
of the Ukrainian people, Europe must already start thinking about
postwar reconstruction. Even if we still don't have a clear picture of
the final scale of the wreckage (or even the final geographic extent of
the country), an aid package on the scale of the Marshall Plan will
likely be needed. At their summit in Brussels, European leaders
discussed an EU recovery fund for Ukraine similar to one set up in 2020
amid the pandemic. The EU should organize a donor conference with NATO
and partners from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. France, as the head of the European Council through the end
of June, should start laying the groundwork now, to be continued by the
Czech Republic when it takes over the rotating presidency later this
year. The success of the reconstruction could, in turn, showcase the
value of liberal democracy---especially if a new Iron Curtain falls
across Europe.

Kyiv must attain a meaningful framework for cooperation with the West,
even though Ukraine's entry into NATO seems unlikely. By now, it's clear
that Ukraine deserves EU candidacy; yet accession is a long process with
many political and administrative hoops to jump through. While
Ukrainians must understand that there are no shortcuts, Kyiv should
still get something soon. That's why the European Union needs to invent
a fast-track special partnership for Ukraine as part of the bloc's
overall reinvention for the post-post-Cold War period. But this new
format needs to be credible: The effects of a protracted EU accession
process are already on display in the Western Balkans, where countries
have started searching for alternative patrons while backsliding on
their reforms.

Europe should offer asylum and humanitarian protection to Russian
soldiers ready to surrender. Today, those who don't want to fight their
Ukrainian neighbors face three awful options: death, captivity in
Ukraine, or a harsh prison sentence in Russia. Europe needs to offer an
alternative, something similar to temporary humanitarian asylum. Such
proposals would be more appealing to young soldiers than to officers,
and even in the best-case scenario, the number who would avail
themselves of the opportunity won't be in the thousands. But even
hundreds matter: It represents a powerful humanitarian gesture---a hand
extended to a demoralized Russian military.

The positive impact of the three prime ministers' trip to Kyiv
underscores the importance of having a diplomatic presence on the
ground. Any EU member states that withdrew their diplomatic corps from
Ukraine should consider sending them back to Kyiv. This is not just a
gesture of solidarity: I was stationed in war-torn Syria when Damascus
was shelled daily between 2013-2015, and while diplomatic work was
difficult, it was still possible---and very much worthwhile. The picture
we got on the ground was different and far more nuanced from the
mediated images the rest of the world was getting. In Syria, the West
left for good political reasons; in Ukraine, it should return as soon as
possible.

Is the East the new West?

As Ivan Kravstev and Stephen Holmes noted in their 2019 book The Light
that Failed, Eastern Europe had been mostly imitating the West since
1989. In the post-Cold War period, the chief aim in the East was to
become---politically, economically, and socially---the new West. It was
a mostly one-way stream of influence.

But now that's partly changing. [The countries of **Central** and
Eastern **Europe** are becoming more **relevant** and **inspiring**, as
their once-hardline stance on **Russia** is becoming increasingly
**mainstream**]{.underline}.

[Consider]{.underline}---in parallel to the Czech takeaways from
Kyiv---[Morawiecki's recently published **ten**-**point** **plan** to
"save" Ukraine. He focuses mainly on **restrictive** **measures**
against Russia and proposes **concrete** **steps** that can be
implemented almost immediately. They include, among other options,
cutting off all Russian banks from SWIFT, **blocking Russian ships**
from **EU ports**, **suspending** **visas** for all Russians, and a
**total** **ban** on the export of **technologies** that can be used for
war.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine has forced Central Europe to move with caution due to Russia's aggression -- they're not moving closer to Russia.

**Wigura & Kuisz '22** \[Karolina; sociologist and historian of ideas;

illiberal turn; 3-25-2022; \"America Thinks the War Is About Ukraine.

WARSAW --- The symbolism was striking. On March 12, two weeks into
Russia's brutal bombardment of Ukraine, the leaders of France and
Germany held a joint call with President Vladimir Putin. Just days
later, [**three** prime ministers]{.underline} from post-Communist
Europe --- [Polish, Czech and Slovenian --- traveled to Kyiv by train,
despite the **danger**]{.underline}.

[This divergence exposed a **sharp divide** in how Eastern and Western
NATO member states view the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. For Western
countries, not least the United States, the conflict is a disaster for
the people of Ukraine --- but one whose biggest danger is that it might
spill over the Ukrainian border, setting off a global conflict.

[For **Central** and Eastern **European** countries]{.underline}, it's
rather different. [These neighbors of Russia tend to see the war not as
a singular event but as a process]{.underline}. To these post-Soviet
states, [the invasion of Ukraine appears as a next step in a whole
series of Russia's nightmarish assaults on other countries, dating back
to]{.underline} the ruthless attacks on [Chechnya and]{.underline} the
war with [Georgia]{.underline}. To them, [it seems foolhardy to
assume]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline} [will stop at Ukraine. The
danger is **pressing** and **immediate**]{.underline}.

While the West believes it must prevent World War III, [the East thinks
that]{.underline}, whatever the name given to the conflict, [the war
against liberal democratic values, institutions and lifestyles has
already started]{.underline}. Both positions have merit. But Mr.
[Biden's visit to Poland]{.underline} on Friday, a day after an
emergency NATO summit, [is a vital opportunity to forge a common
understanding]{.underline}. Both sides, West and East, must present a
united front against Russian aggression. The alternative is disarray and
destruction.

[At the root of the divide is **history**]{.underline}. Across
centuries, Central and Eastern Europe have experienced the chilling
effects of Russian imperialism. From czarist Russia to the Soviet Union,
[many countries through the region had their **independence stamped
out**, their societies **oppressed** and their **cultures**
**marginalized**]{.underline}. The trauma caused by the cyclical loss of
territory and statehood is one of the most important elements of
collective identity across the region.

[Many Central and Eastern Europeans share]{.underline} an anxious [sense
of themselves, a **nervous sovereignty**. Their
independence]{.underline}, restored with such great effort after 1989,
[could easily be lost again]{.underline}, as the 20th century proved all
too painfully. [In the tragic fate of Ukraine]{.underline}, and earlier
of Chechnya and Georgia, [they see not only their own traumatic past but
also their **possible future**]{.underline}. "We will be next" is the
phrase on many lips.

In this febrile atmosphere, [NATO's cautious steps look to many
**Central** and Eastern **Europeans** like an **echo** of the **phony
war**]{.underline} of 1939, when France and Britain undertook only
limited military actions and did not save their eastern ally, Poland. At
that time, too, [horrible stories from bombed Warsaw and other cities
filled the media.]{.underline} Yet the allies were determined not to be
drawn in too deeply. Their military inaction temporarily delayed the
spread of the war across the globe, but did not stop it.

#### NATO's stationed permanent forces in Poland -- prefer the Defense Secretary's confirmation. 

**Strozewski 6-29** \[Zoe; correspondent at Newsweek, citing Defense
Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; 6-29-2022; \"U.S. establishing permanent
troops in Poland amid fears of NATO-Russia war\"; Newsweek;

Accessed 7-19-2022; RL\]

[The U.S. will **station** its first **permanent forces** on NATO\'s
Eastern flank]{.underline}, U.S. [Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III
announced Wednesday, as **fears** mount over a **potential war** between
Russia and the 30-member alliance.]{.underline}

In a Twitter thread detailing several new commitments from U.S.
President Joe Biden to bolster security in Europe, [Austin said that the
V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post, an Army garrison headquarters
and a field support **battalion** will be stationed in **Poland**, which
shares a border with **non-NATO member Russia**.]{.underline}

\"[These forces]{.underline} -- [the first permanent U.S. forces on
NATO\'s Eastern Flank]{.underline} -- [will improve our **command**
**and** **control** capabilities, **interoperability** with NATO, and
management of prepositioned equipment]{.underline},\" the Defense
Department said in an accompanying fact sheet. \"[This action builds on
the **central role** Poland has played in **supporting** NATO\'s combat
**credible** **deterrence** and **defense** **posture**]{.underline}."

Officials such as Russian President Vladimir [**Putin** and]{.underline}
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry [**Peskov** have issued warnings in recent
months against **NATO** **expansion** or perceived threats from the
alliance]{.underline} that [they say could endanger Russia\'s
security]{.underline}, even as their own country continues its
monthslong assault on Ukraine.

T[he new European security commitments from Biden that Austin announced
on Wednesday]{.underline}, as well as NATO\'s invitation for Sweden and
Finland to join its ranks, [might further fuel Russia\'s **ire** and
**feelings of vulnerability** against the alliance]{.underline}.

[Putin has cited the prospect of NATO expansion as one of his reasons
for justifying the war in Ukraine]{.underline}, though the move seemed
to backfire when Sweden and Finland announced their intention to join
the alliance after Russia\'s invasion. [Russia has also **warned**
against any **direct** **NATO** **involvement** in the war, and taken
issue with the **weapons** and **supplies** some member countries have
funneled into Ukraine]{.underline}.

Mikhail [Khodorkovsky, a self-exiled Russian oligarch and Kremlin
critic, warned]{.underline} during an interview with the
France-headquartered television network Euronews last month [that Putin
could **eventually wage war** on **NATO** if Ukraine does not
win]{.underline} the current war. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky warned in a video address to NATO\'s summit in Madrid this week
that Putin\'s aggression could spread beyond Ukraine\'s borders and into
a NATO country within a year.

[Despite]{.underline} the prospect of [Russian aggression]{.underline},
some of [NATO\'s recent actions indicate that the alliance is not shying
from bolstering its own strength and assisting Ukraine.]{.underline}

[NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that the number
of NATO troops on high readiness will increase more than
**sevenfold**]{.underline}, the [largest boost since the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. He also said that [NATO members will agree on a
\"**strengthened assistance package**\" for Ukraine that includes
**anti-drone systems** and **secure communication**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- China Thumper

#### China's refusal to condemn Ukraine has [accelerated]{.underline} Central Europe's shift away from Russia. 

**McCarthy 6-30** \[Simone; correspondent for China for CNN Digital
Worldwide; 6-30-2022; \"Europe sees China through a Russian lens, and

Accessed 7-16-2022; RL游땕\]

[China's concerns have been **clear** this week, as]{.underline} its
Foreign Ministry pushed back on the NATO designation in regular
scheduled press briefings. "China pursues an independent foreign policy
of peace. It does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs or
export ideology, still less engage in long-arm jurisdiction, economic
coercion or unilateral sanctions. How could China be labeled a 'systemic
challenge'?" ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday. "We
solemnly urge NATO to immediately stop spreading false and provocative
statements against China," he said, adding that NATO should "stop
seeking to disrupt Asia and the whole world after it has disrupted
Europe." But [that rhetoric -- blaming NATO for "disruption" in Europe
-- is part of what is driving a **shift** in **European
perspectives**]{.underline}, analysts say, [as Beijing has **refused**
to **condemn** Russia's actions in Ukraine]{.underline}, including the
killing of civilians, [while actively blaming the US and NATO for
provoking Moscow. China "very **quickly** and very clearly **lined**
itself up]{.underline} -- at least in words, not so much in deeds --
[with Russia]{.underline}," while transatlantic partners came together
against Russia and in support of Ukraine in the wake of the invasion,
said Pepijn Bergsen, a research fellow in the Europe Program at the
Chatham House think tank in London. [The contrast between the two has
helped drive an emerging "**democracies** **versus** **autocracies**"
narrative]{.underline} in Europe, he said, adding that [internal
politics also play a role]{.underline}. "[In]{.underline} Eastern and
[Central Europe, where Russia is regarded as]{.underline} by far the
number one [security threat, relations]{.underline} (with China) [had
already been starting to fray, but the fact that China so **clearly
lined up** with Russia has **accelerated** a **shift**]{.underline},"
Bergsen said. [China]{.underline}, for its part, [appears to have
underestimated the extent to which its stance would **reverberate**
through its relationship with Europe, one]{.underline} that was [already
on shaky ground following European concerns over alleged human rights
abuses in **Xinjiang**, erosion of **freedoms** in Hong Kong and China's
economic targeting of Lithuania over the **Baltic nation**'s relations
with Taiwan]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Cyber Thumper

#### NATO has [already increased]{.underline} cybersecurity defense with Ukraine -- thumps the DA. 

**Hakmeh & Naylor 3-7** \[Joyce; a senior research fellow for the
International Security Programme at Chatham House; Esther; a research
analyst at the International Security Programme; 3-7-2022; \"How the
tech community has rallied to Ukraine's cyber-defence\"; Guardian;
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/tech-community-rallied-ukraine-cyber-defence-eu-nato;
Accessed 7-19-2022; RL\]

In response to the Russian threat, [there have been **unprecedented
efforts** by private and government entities]{.underline} -- and even
individuals -- [to support Ukraine's cyber resilience.]{.underline}

[Responding to cyber]{.underline}-attacks [and building national cyber
resilience]{.underline} has never been -- and will never be -- the sole
responsibility of governments. It [require]{.underline}s [a
**whole-of-society approach** grounded in international
cooperation]{.underline} efforts. For the first time since its
inception, [the EU rapid cyber response team, with capabilities to
detect and respond to a variety of threats, and headed by Lithuania, was
**deployed** to help defend against **cyber-attacks** targeting
Ukraine]{.underline}. The [Romania]{.underline}n national cybersecurity
agency [and]{.underline} a cybersecurity company called [Bitdefender
launched a public-private partnership to provide pro bono **technical
support** and threat intelligence]{.underline} to Ukraine's government,
businesses and citizens for "as long as it is necessary". [**NATO**,
which has been working for]{.underline} a number of [years with Ukraine
to increase its **cyber** **defences**, signed an agreement a few weeks
before the **invasion** aimed at enhancing **cyber cooperation** with
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[The tech community leveraged]{.underline} its [**resources** and
**knowledge** to expose cyber-attacks and threats, and limit their
spread]{.underline}. Shortly [after WhisperGate]{.underline}, [Microsoft
shared tech]{.underline}nical [analysis on]{.underline} the [**tools**
and **techniques** used in the attack and recommendations for those
affected]{.underline}, and it continues to do so. The Slovakia-based
cybersecurity firm [ESET exposed the nefarious component of the
HermeticWiper malware attacks]{.underline} in February, a malware
designed with a component aimed at "wiping" the data out of systems.
This timely technical analysis provided vital information to security
experts and governments about the technical steps that should be put in
place to mitigate and protect against hacks.

At the same time, efforts within Ukraine started to materialise. In what
has been referred to as an unprecedented effort in the midst of an armed
conflict, a whole "IT army" of volunteers was assembled in response to a
request by the minister of digital transformation to support the
country's cyber-defence efforts, with reports of some even operating
from within bomb shelters.

[The **solidarity** shown so far is **unprecedented** and a testament to
the **benefits** and potential of **collective action** across sectors
and **communities**]{.underline}. As the war continues, this solidarity
will become even more important.

### 2AC -- Ukraine Thumper

#### Ukraine is a [turning point]{.underline} -- Central Europe is using solidarity against Russia to distance themselves. 

**Brix 2-24** \[Emil; the Director of the Diplomatische Akademie Wien --

Ambassador Brix, [February 24]{.underline}, 2022 [marked a change in
Europe\'s relations with Russia]{.underline}. Before that, [there was a
period of economic integration and a hope for **peaceful, prosperous**
neighbourly relations. This hope seems to have been
**destroyed**]{.underline}. How do you see the further development of
Europe\'s relations with Russia?

February 24 was a decisive turning point in the relations between Europe
and Russia. [The reason]{.underline} for this [was that it marked the
destruction of the hope that through **close cooperation** -- between
universities, civil society, but also economic partners -- we could
achieve a reasonable relationship between **Russia** and **Europe**. The
war of **aggression** is proof]{.underline} that [one side does not want
that]{.underline}. Therefore, we have to assume that a rather
impenetrable new wall is being created here in Europe between Russia and
the rest of Europe. And this also raises the question: [what does this
mean for **Central Europe**, for those states that are relatively recent
members of the European Union, that have had decades of experience with
**communism**, with the Soviet Union? To what extent have these
countries]{.underline} now [become a region]{.underline} in Europe [that
can]{.underline}, on the one hand, [help us to understand what\'s going
on; and]{.underline} on the other hand, actually [help us defend what
**European values** are]{.underline}?

Apart from Central and Eastern Europe, you were also stationed in Russia
as a diplomat, so can you assess what this ultimately means for Russia
too?

The war is a decisive turning point for the Russian side as well. [It is
to be expected that the result of this war will be a weak, isolated
Russia -- both politically and economically, but also in terms of
**cultural** and **scientific** links]{.underline}. It is true that
[many people are trying to maintain contacts as far as possible -- and
rightly so, as far as they are not politically driven -- but this will
only be partially successful, and we can expect to see even **stronger
nationalism** on the Russian side]{.underline}. The leadership in the
Kremlin in Moscow has decided to stake everything on this approach:
isolation, military strength and strong control of its own population.
Apparently, it accepts that this will bring disadvantages for the
Russian population as a whole.

What is driving Russia, and are official Russia and the Russian
population on the same page?

For years now, only the official depiction of what drives
[Russia]{.underline} and what its interests are has existed. Everything
that we understand by the term "civil society" has been systematically
dismantled and banned in recent years. If you ask me what arguments the
official leadership uses, they [see the West as an **ideological enemy**
that no longer upholds anything that remains in terms of traditional
values]{.underline}. And official [Russia casts itself as the preserver
of traditional values -- family, religion, gender roles -- and this is
currently supported by a **majority** of the Russian
population]{.underline}; the polls are quite clear on that. But this
strong focus on a \'different civilization\', a different worldview, is
certainly not undisputed in Russia. Too much has happened since the
Soviet Union in terms of modernization, opening up, and scientific
contacts. Many people have emigrated in the wake of February 24, but
many are still there. In order to avoid putting themselves in danger,
they have to stand back and wait a bit to see what can be done publicly.
However, we have opportunities to continue to work together on both
sides here. Science and culture in particular are predestined to do
this. In the long term, we need this contact -- for historical,
cultural, geographical and human reasons.

Does this mean that calls to break off academic relations and expel
Russian cultural workers are actually the wrong way to go, and these
channels should remain open?

We should maintain contacts on the cultural and scientific level as much
as possible. However, certainly not with those who have been in
solidarity with the Kremlin\'s policy explicitly and for a long time. I
am very much in favour of us taking a clear position here. That is
actually what everyone in Europe has done. Even we at the Diplomatic
Academy have suspended official contact with the leading Russian
academy. Nevertheless, we did not send the Russian students home.

Europe has shown itself to be quick and surprisingly united in its
support of Ukraine. However, there are fault lines too now; there is
disagreement even among the Visegr치d states. Do you see the danger of a
split due to these fault lines?

I would put it positively: it is actually a miracle that we have so far
managed to get far-reaching sanctions packages against Russia, against
this war, off the ground with relatively little discussion. It\'s a real
miracle that we\'ve managed to get arms financing through a resolution
in the European Union. So there\'s a lot of positives here. I think that
[perceptions of Poland, for example, which have been very **negative**
in recent years, are **changing** as we see how they deal with
**refugees** from **Ukraine**]{.underline}. Or think about
[Lithuania]{.underline}. They were the [first European state that not
only recognized the energy dependence on Russian oil and gas, but also
did]{.underline} something about it by [build]{.underline}ing [an LNG
terminal in 2014 to provide]{.underline} exactly [this **alternative**
to Russian gas]{.underline}, and today they are a role model with that.
And [it's a **Central European** state]{.underline} that has done this,
not one of the rich Western European states. That means there are very
many positive contributions that Central European states are making in
this dangerous situation.

At the same time, however, we also have Central European states that
tend to put on the brakes -- and in some cases only because of economic
considerations.

[In a state of emergency]{.underline}, as [this war is for]{.underline}
a region like [Central Europe, it is]{.underline} very
[understandable]{.underline} that [you look at your national situation
first. In **Austria**]{.underline}, we say that [security of supply is
the most important thing as far as energy issues are
concerned]{.underline}. The [Hungarians say that **national**
**patriotic** **unity** must not be endangered]{.underline} and that we
have to look after our minorities in Ukraine. So [each of the Central
European countries is directly affected]{.underline}, and most of them
are [more]{.underline} affected [than Portugal, Spain or
France]{.underline}. This means you have to understand that the
situation is really different. I don\'t think that the political climate
of opinion at the moment sees the Central European region as having a
destructive role. On the contrary, I believe that people are now
beginning to understand what the historical experience of these [Central
Europeans]{.underline}, who for decades were largely under the Soviet
yoke, actually means. Because this didn't just mean that they [had to
orient themselves]{.underline} symbolically towards the East, but that

#### The EU is pursuing a [military]{.underline} strategy against Russia

**EU Neighbors East 7/21** (\"War in Ukraine: EU adopts 'maintenance and
alignment' package against Russia\", 7-21-2022, EU Neighbors East,

DOA: 7-21-2022)//sposten

[In **response** to Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [today adopted **new
measures** intended to **tighten** existing **economic sanctions**
targeting Russia, improve their implementation, and strengthen their
effectiveness.]{.underline}

[This 'maintenance and alignment' package introduces a new prohibition
to]{.underline} purchase, import, or [transfer]{.underline}, directly or
indirectly, **[gold]{.underline}**, if it originates in Russia and it
has been exported from Russia into the EU or to any third country after.
This prohibition [also covers jewelry.]{.underline}

[The package also extends the list of controlled items]{.underline},
which may contribute to Russia's military and technological enhancement
or the development of its defence and security sector, thereby
[**reinforcing export controls** on dual use and advanced
technology.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [the new measures **extend** the **existing port access
ban** to locks to avoid the circumvention of sanctions and expand the
scope of the prohibition on accepting deposits to include those from
legal persons]{.underline}, entities or bodies established in third
countries and majority-owned by Russian nationals or natural persons
residing in Russia. The acceptance of deposits for non-prohibited
cross-border trade will be subject to a prior authorisation by the
national competent authorities.

[The EU is also introducing a number of **clarifications** to existing
measures]{.underline}, for instance in the field of public procurement,
aviation and justice. For instance, technical assistance to Russia for
aviation goods and technology will be allowed insofar as it is needed to
safeguard the technical industrial standard setting work of the
International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the prohibition to enter
into any transactions with Russian public entities will be slightly
amended to ensure access to justice.

The EU also decided to [extend the exemption]{.underline} from the
prohibition [to engage in **transactions**]{.underline} with certain
state-owned entities as regards transactions for agricultural products
and the transport of oil to third countries.

[**"None** of the measures adopted today or earlier in view of Russia's
actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine **target** in any way the
trade in **ag**ricultural and food products]{.underline}, including
wheat and fertilisers, between third countries and Russia," specifies
the EU. "Similarly, EU measures do not prevent third countries and their
nationals operating outside of the EU from purchasing pharmaceutical or
medical products from Russia."

According to EU High Representative Josep Borrell, the EU also "listed
another major Russian Bank, Sberbank, and added further individuals
involved in Russia's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, such as
military officials, the Night Wolves motorcycle club and disinformation
actors".

[The Council also **strengthened** reporting requirements, putting the
burden of **declaring assets** onto **sanctioned** people.]{.underline}
This measure aims to facilitate the freezing of their assets in the EU.

#### Putin [can't be trusted]{.underline} by his words

**RFE 22** (\"Putin Claims Russia Will 'Guarantee' Peaceful Export Of
Ukrainian Grain\", 6-3-2022, Radio Free Europe,
https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-war-grain/31882556.html, DOA:

Russian President Vladimir [Putin **denied accusations**]{.underline}
his armed forces are blocking Ukrainian grain exports from the Black Sea
and said his government would "guarantee\" peaceful passage to ships
leaving Ukraine\'s ports.

In an interview with Russian state television on June 3, [Putin tried to
put the blame on Ukraine for the trapped grain]{.underline}, saying Kyiv
has mined the Black Sea and sunk vessels, preventing grain ships from
leaving.

Ukraine carried out those steps after Russia launched a massive,
unprovoked invasion by land and air on February 24, sparking fears it
could seek to use its navy to storm the key Black Sea port of Odesa.

"I have already told all our colleagues many times: let them clear the
mines and let the ships loaded with grain leave the ports. We guarantee
their peaceful passage into international waters without any problems,\"
Putin said.

[The Russian president said his armed forces would **not use** the
**removal** of mines "to launch any attacks \[on Ukraine\] from the
sea."]{.underline}

Glen Howard, a military analyst and president of the Washington-based
Jamestown Foundation, said history shows [**Putin can't be trusted** to
abide by his word.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin **repeatedly** said Russia had **no intention** of invading
Ukraine in the months leading up to its attack.]{.underline}

Howard said Ukraine now has anti-ship missile systems to defend its
coast from invasion, including several delivered late last month by
Denmark.

However, [he said that grain **ships leaving Ukrainian ports** would
have **no escort** if they set sail and thus would be **"trusting the
Russians at their word."**]{.underline}

Putin's comments came after he met with Senegal\'s President Macky Sall,
who is also the current head of the African Union, to discuss surging
food prices.

Africa is heavily dependent on grain supplies from Russia and Ukraine
and any disruptions could lead to social unrest on the continent.

The surge in food prices triggered by the conflict is already putting
pressure on African governments and, in some countries, leading to
protests.

Amid isolation from the West, Putin has been seeking to build his ties
with African nations, many of whom have significant historical ties to
Moscow dating back to Soviet times.

\"President Putin has expressed to us his willingness to facilitate the
export of Ukrainian cereals,\" Sall wrote on Twitter after meeting
Putin.

The war has blocked as much as 25 million tons of Ukrainian grain at
local ports, Howard said.

[Putin sought to **downplay** the significance of the **issue**, saying
Ukrainian grain only represents about 2.5 percent of total world grain
production.]{.underline}

However, Ukrainian grain makes up a significant percentage of global
exports and thus has outsided influence on world prices.

[Putin also **blamed the U**nited **S**tates for rising food prices,
saying the **U.S.** central bank **stimulated inflation** by printing
too much money.]{.underline}

But wheat and corn prices have surged more than a quarter since Russia
began massing its troops along Ukraine's border in late October amid
fears over grain exports while the United States has taken steps to
curtail inflation by raising rates.

Russia also cut back on gas exports to Europe leading up to the war to
gain leverage in talks with the West over Ukraine, driving prices to
record highs. Natural gas is a key component in fertilizers used by
farmers.

Putin suggested Ukraine could export grain via the Baltic Sea by
shipping its products by rail through Belarus.

[The West would have to **lift sanctions** against Belarus to do
so.]{.underline}

Howard dismissed Putin's suggestion as impractical, saying [there is
**not nearly enough rail capacity** to move Ukraine's
grain.]{.underline}

[Rail is also more **expensive** and shipping from the Baltic ports to
Africa would **extend the sea route** by thousands of
miles.]{.underline}

Howard said time is running out to export [the grain]{.underline},
adding it [will]{.underline} begin to [**rot** by July.]{.underline}

#### G20 summit [failed]{.underline} and heightened [tensions]{.underline}

[Diplomats from the world's major industrialized nations **failed** on
July 8 to find **common ground** over Russia's war in
Ukraine]{.underline} and how to deal with its impact on grain shipments
and energy markets.

[Russia's foreign minister **walked out**]{.underline} of two sessions
held by diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) [amid **criticism** of the
war]{.underline} on Ukraine [and amid calls for Russia to allow Kyiv to
ship **grain** out to the world.]{.underline}

The July 8 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, was intended to lay the
groundwork for a summit of G20 leaders later this year. [The war and
**soaring** global food and energy **prices** that have resulted from it
topped the agenda.]{.underline}

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of the morning meeting
after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock criticized Moscow for
the war.

The vast majority of [representatives at the meeting had **condemned**
\"Russia\'s brutal war of aggression,\"]{.underline} Baerbock said.
\"The appeal of all 19 states was very clear to Russia: This war must
end.\"

Lavrov left the afternoon session before Ukrainian Foreign Minister
Dmytro Kuleba's scheduled virtual speech. Kuleba told ministers to
\"remember about 344 families who have lost their children when
listening to Russian lies.\"

Lavrov told reporters the discussions \"strayed almost immediately, as
soon as they took the floor, to the frenzied criticism of the Russian
Federation in connection with the situation in Ukraine.\"

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Lavrov was in
the room when the meeting began and \"about two hours later he began to
hold bilateral talks with colleagues in the same forum in the next
room.\"

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned the Russian
invasion.

\"What we\'ve heard today already is a strong chorus from around the
world\...about the need for the aggression to end,\" Blinken said.

During a closed-door session of officials, Blinken, who refused to hold
one-on-one meetings with Lavrov, demanded Moscow allow grain shipments
out of Ukraine.

\"To our Russian colleagues: Ukraine is not your country. Its grain is
not your grain. Why are you blocking the ports? You should let the grain
out,\" Blinken said, according to a Western official present.

Zakharova said [Lavrov was **not present** to hear Blinken\'s
comments.]{.underline}

Members of the G20, whose countries account for about 80 percent of the
world\'s economic output and about two-thirds of the world\'s
population, had much to address as prices for meat, cereals, vegetable
oils, dairy products, and sugar have soared in recent months, due
largely to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine is not a member of the G20 but is one of the world's largest
exporters of corn and sunflower oil, but Russia's invasion halted most
of that flow. Millions of tons of Ukrainian grain are stuck in silos,
unable to be exported due to Russia's naval presence in the Black Sea.

Those disruptions threaten food supplies for many developing countries,
especially in Africa.

But the meeting ended with no group photo taken nor a final communique
issued as has been done in previous years. It also exposed further
evidence of an East-West split driven by China and Russia on one side
and the United States and Europe on the other.

In closing remarks, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said
[\"participants expressed **deep concern** about the **humanitarian**
impacts of the war\"]{.underline} in Ukraine, and \"some members
expressed condemnation\" of the invasion.

The meeting\'s agenda was also rocked by the resignation of British
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which prompted his foreign secretary, Liz
Truss, to depart Bali, and the assassination of former Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe.

While in Bali, Blinken will also seek to reopen dialogue with Beijing in
talks on July 9 with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Lavrov met Wang on July 7 to discuss Russia\'s invasion. [The United
States has **condemned Beijing\'s support** for Russia, and Blinken is
expected to reiterate those warnings in talks with Wang.]{.underline}

ISTANBUL---[Negotiators, having reached the outlines of a deal
for]{.underline} Ukraine to export [grain]{.underline} from seaports
amid the war with Russia, [face **challenges** to getting it done, from
the **demining** of ports to **persuading shippers** they can operate
safely in a conflict zone.]{.underline}

Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and United Nations officials are expected to
resume negotiations this week on a framework that would establish a
grain export corridor in the Black Sea and potentially help alleviate a
hunger crisis in some developing countries.

U.N. Secretary-General Ant칩nio Guterres planned to fly to Istanbul on
Thursday evening, a U.N. spokesman said. The announcement of the trip
raised hopes that a deal could be signed in the coming days, although
the spokesman said the situation remained fluid.

Turkey's and Russia's presidents have sounded positive about the talks,
as has a senior Ukrainian official. Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, whose government has brokered the negotiations with the U.N.,
expressed optimism Wednesday that Russia and Ukraine would soon sign a
deal.

to Steal Ukraine Grain

While the war in Ukraine has upended the global supply of grain, a WSJ
investigation reveals [how Russia has **quietly institutionalized** the
**theft** of hundreds of thousands of metric tons of it out of newly
occupied areas of Ukraine and into Russian-allied countries in the
Middle East.]{.underline} Photo illustration: Adele Morgan

"This week, we want to put this agreement into writing. And we wish that
this plan will start to be implemented in the coming days," Turkey's
state-run news agency quoted Mr. Erdogan as saying, a day after he met
with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

An agreement could potentially free up about 18 million tons of wheat,
corn and other supplies that war has prevented Ukraine from exporting,
with the Russian invasion contributing to a rise in global food prices
that U.S. officials said has sparked protests in 17 countries.

[**Substantial differences** still need to be **bridged** among the
warring parties]{.underline}, said Western officials. [Should the
governments reach a deal, privately owned freighters, insurers and sea
crews might be **reluctant** to handle cargoes from Odessa and other
war-zone ports, given the **threat** of further **attacks**, according
to the officials, grain traders and other industry experts.]{.underline}

Ukraine faces the challenge of how to store or export its coming summer
harvest.

[Both Russia and Ukraine have laid **sea mines** in the Black Sea that
pose a hazard to the movement of any ships in the area. Military
delegations from Russia and Ukraine **disagreed** in the talks in recent
weeks over how the **demining** would take place]{.underline}, a U.S.
official said.

[Ukraine has **also increased** the number of mines]{.underline} near
its ports in recent weeks to defend against possible Russian attacks,
the official said.

[Safe passage for ships]{.underline} handling food cargoes [and
**procedures** for **searching** private vessels to ensure they aren't
carrying military equipment are among the issues to be
resolved]{.underline}, officials said. Beyond that, [**Ukraine** has
**demanded international security** guarantees to prevent a Russian
attack once mines are removed.]{.underline}

["You **still** have to get the **parties to address the demining** and
the unfettered access and movement for the vessels
themselves,"]{.underline} said the U.S. official.

talks in Istanbul earlier this month.PHOTO: TURKISH DEFENCE

[Russia is still seen as a **potential spoiler**]{.underline}, U.S. and
other officials said, with Washington and Ankara trying to pressure the
Kremlin to reach a deal and implement it.

"Turkey is pressing Russia to say this can't be a zero nothing forever.
And [Russia, you're not going to like the look if you make your own navy
guys take back their own mines. That's an **admission of
guilt,"**]{.underline} the official said.

Mr. Putin, meeting Mr. Erdogan on Tuesday, thanked him for his mediation
and said that the talks had made progress. "Not all issues, however,
have been resolved. But the fact that we have moved forward is already
good," Mr. Putin said, according to remarks shown on Russian television.

Meanwhile, skeptical U.S. officials this week pointed to recent Russian
attacks on Ukrainian ports and grain-storage facilities as part of its
war strategy.

["We are hoping for the best, but we have seen how **Putin weaponizes
food,"**]{.underline} Jose Fernandez, the U.S. undersecretary of state
for economic growth, energy and the environment, said on Wednesday.

To nudge the talks forward, the U.S. and the European Union have in
recent days clarified that financial sanctions against Russia don't
pertain to food and agricultural trade. Clearing a path for Russia's
food and fertilizer exports is part of the framework for a broader deal
on grain exports put forward by Mr. Guterres.

The stakes of a potential agreement are high for the poorer nations that
were Ukraine's biggest customers. Much of the grain formerly exported
via the Black Sea went to Asian countries and to Egypt, the world's
largest importer of wheat.

While grain prices have fallen from the highs they reached in the
aftermath of the invasion, an increase in Ukrainian supply would ease
pressure on prices.

[**Grain traders** working in the region also **expressed doubt** that
Russia would allow the grain exports while its **military campaign**
continues to **destroy Ukraine's farms**, roads, grain-storage
facilities and other **vital infrastructure** necessary to **export
grain.**]{.underline}

"To me, [their objective is **strangulation**, somehow or another, of
Ukraine. They've been stealing grain from the occupied
areas,"]{.underline} said Jonathan Grange, a partner at Sunstone
Brokers, an agricultural-commodities brokerage working in Ukraine and
the Black Sea region.

Ukraine exported about two million metric tons of grain in June overland
and via smaller ships leaving the Danube River into the Black Sea,
according to Ukrainian officials. That maritime route opened up this
month after Ukraine's military retook strategic Snake Island from
Russia, which occupied it soon after the invasion began in February.

In addition to up to 18 million tons of grain currently trapped in
Ukraine as a result of the invasion, there is also the challenge of how
to store or export the country's coming summer harvest of an estimated
65 million tons, according to Mr. Grange.

"We are desperately looking at those negotiations," said Ivan Kriuchkov,
a director at Ukrainian agribusiness IMC. "If the ports don't open,
where do we put all our grain?"

Despite modest gains in east Ukraine, [June was **not a good month** for
Russia.]{.underline} Within a single week, [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [leaders offered Kyiv candidacy for membership, NATO
reached an agreement to bring Sweden and Finland into the alliance and
Great Britain's defense secretary, Ben Wallace, called for a **20
percent hike** to his budget.]{.underline}

[These historic developments are sure to rile Kremlin officials, but the
future of Western support to Ukraine's fight remains **uncertain.** As
**public interest** in the war continues to **dwindle**, appeasing
Russia's extortionate demands could become more
**desirable.**]{.underline} Such [**concessions** would do more than
disfigure Ukraine and impose devastating **new realities** on Western
**security** institutions --- they would **declare** to the world that
**imperialism is negotiable.**]{.underline}

[The debate over policy]{.underline} toward Ukraine [has split experts
into two camps]{.underline}. One side believes this war will end only
when Russia is humiliated and exhausted militarily by a stream of
Western arms packages. Until now, the Biden administration has pursued a
strategy along these lines.

The other camp sees that option as far-fetched and too costly, and
instead seeks diplomatic solutions to Russia's war. Proposed remedies
typically include allowing Russia to expand its borders into Ukraine and
insisting that Kyiv amend its constitution by swearing never to join
NATO. These conditions echo Moscow's demands to the letter. In exchange,
Russia might stop leveling Ukrainian cities. While this bargain is
clearly an example of political extortion, it tends to moonlight under
the cover of various euphemisms.

Among them are [the terms "diplomacy," "negotiations" and "realist
international relations theory."]{.underline} Veteran diplomat Henry
Kissinger, scholars John Mearsheimer and Barry Posen and the New York
Times editorial board have all argued for solutions in line with such
euphemisms. Admittedly, as the war wears down the pocketbooks and
attention spans of Western governments, even some Russia hawks have
crept slowly into the appeasement camp. French President Emmanuel
Macron, who only months ago reminded Putin slyly that France too was a
nuclear power, has since said that Russia must not be humiliated in
Ukraine.

[These **arguments** have merit, but they **miss** the **underlying
question** that **appeasement** poses to the world: If **Ukraine** is
**not worth saving** from an **overestimated** and supposedly
**crumbling** power, **who is?**]{.underline}

Such [inquiries give shape to the type of **global power competition**
described in U.S. strategic documents of the last two presidential
administrations. The question is **essential** not only to resolving the
war in **Ukraine**, but also to enabling the Biden administration's
integrated deterrence concept aimed at competing with powers such as
**Russia**, **China**, **Iran** and **No**rth **Ko**rea --- **each** of
which **jockey** for **leverage** over the West.]{.underline}

For them, [this jockeying process involves **convincing** observers that
the U.S.-led **security** infrastructure established after the Cold War
is in a **twilight** and can no longer sustain the existing
international order. **Fear** plays a role in **driving** the point
**home.**]{.underline}

[Bringing Finland and Sweden into NATO might strengthen the alliance,
but their desire to join after seven decades of neutrality is proof that
nations external to NATO feel remarkably **vulnerable.**]{.underline}
Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's political party won a super majority
in Japan shortly after his July 8 assassination. He was perhaps most
famous for his role as architect of the informal Quad alliance, what
some consider the early phase of an Indo-Pacific NATO.

[Aside from its **paternalistic** nature, appeasement fails to see the
bigger picture. The idea of the **free world** as a **conglomerate** of
nations that share liberal democratic values has **animated** political
campaigns and national security policies for
**generations.**]{.underline} This concept is [**rooted** in the
**assumption** that a rules-based international order **prevents
tyrants** from doing exactly what Putin is doing. If the existing order
**cannot serve** this purpose, it will suffer a **severe blow** to its
credibility, especially]{.underline} in places [where
diplomats]{.underline} and military advisers such as myself [work to
assure foreign partners]{.underline} of our commitment to those
principles.

[Condoning Russia's extortion further **undermines** the diplomatic
process because it **corrodes** the legitimacy of existing **treaties**
upon which many countries rely for materiel and political
support.]{.underline} Clearly, [Moscow has thrown out the
**Russo-Ukrainian Treaty**]{.underline} of 1997. But [the]{.underline}
1994 **[Budapest Memorandum]{.underline}** -- bearing the signatures of
the United States, Russia and United Kingdom -- offered Western-backed
security guarantees in exchange for Kyiv relinquishing its nuclear
arsenal. If that parlay ultimately contributes to Ukraine's
disintegration, [the West could face a **credibility crisis** in future
diplomatic exchanges. Putin's statements amplify]{.underline} this
[**erosion of trust** and nest it]{.underline} conveniently with[in the
**twilight narrative.**]{.underline}

[Realists want the West to shake off the war in Ukraine and focus on
China]{.underline}, even as Belarusian president and Putin ally
Alexander Lukashenko uses terms like "moral cleansing" to describe his
vision of Europe's future. [But if Moscow can **leverage** its
**atrocities** in Ukraine to **bludgeon** the **free world** into
**conciliation**, it will signify a terrifying new beginning, not the
end of a war.]{.underline}

As argued by Lt. Gen. James Dubik in these pages[, forcing Ukraine to
the **negotiating table** in a position of **weakness** is a **recipe
for disaster.** Considering the]{.underline} 2014 [annexation of
Crimea]{.underline}, the ongoing use of [genocidal tactics]{.underline}
in Ukraine [and the likelihood of a protracted insurgency]{.underline}
in Russian-occupied territories, [it is folly to assume that a
sacrificial land offering will produce anything resembling
stability.]{.underline}

[Russia's incursion presents to the world a **troubling question** that
it must answer collectively: Is imperialism negotiable? Outside Ukraine,
appeasement is an easy option because it creates the **mirage of
reconciliation**]{.underline} while demanding nothing from those
conjuring the illusion. [On the other hand, **generating the political
will** to explore new frameworks of burden sharing in support of
Ukraine's fight is much **hard**]{.underline}er, [but it is the **only
solution** that clearly answers the question of how much imperialism
Europe will tolerate this century.]{.underline}

[If the answer is anything **more** than **zero**, then Moscow is at
liberty to continue **exploiting** that **ambiguity** with its
**imperial interests.** Public officials]{.underline} from Washington to
Canberra [must consider the **long-term** effects of Russia experiencing
anything less than **abject failure** in Ukraine.]{.underline}

One calls to mind [the 1805 "Plumb-pudding in danger"

Last month, French President Emmanuel [Macron suggested that Europe
**"must not humiliate Russia**]{.underline} so that the day the fighting
stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels," contesting
that diplomacy must consistently be considered to address violent
conflicts. Problematically, Macron simultaneously implied that
negotiations could only take place if Russia can escape any form of
shame or humiliation.

This gave rise to mixed reactions from other Western leaders. The United
States Ambassador to the European Union, Mark Gitenstein, declared that
Russian President Vladimir Putin had "humiliated himself" by his conduct
in the war and that the West wanted to see him defeated on the
battlefields of Ukraine. Similarly, former US ambassador to Moscow,
Michael McFaul, claimed: "Putin will only negotiate when his army can't
keep marching forward, humiliated or not. Macron should focus on
creating that condition." The strongest European reactions came from the
head of the Estonian parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission, Marko
Mihkelson, who stated that Macron was "still looking for ways to save
war criminal Putin from humiliation," and Lithuanian Foreign Minister
Gabrielius Landsbergis claimed Macron's comments risked jeopardising the
unity and security of the EU. Most notably, Ukrainian Minister of
Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said that allies should "better focus on
how to put Russia in its place" and that "calls to avoid humiliation of
Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call
for it."

By contrast, no reactions emerged from the German and Italian
governments. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Mario Draghi have
previously hinted that resolving the conflict might require Ukraine to
comply with Russian claims on certain territories. The four-point plan
Draghi put forward in late May included a bilateral agreement between
Russia and Ukraine to clarify the future of Crimea and Donbas, which
would, in this scenario, have almost complete autonomy. The Italian
plan's proximity to core Russian demands had led many to describe it as
'classic appeasement'. For his part, Scholz has avoided non-committal or
conflicting public announcements, refraining from affirming that Ukraine
should recapture all lost territory, settling instead to comment that
Putin could "not win" the war.

[Calls to avoid Russia's humiliation do not guarantee Europe's security,
but rather **strengthen Russia** and **weaken the EU** in the long
run]{.underline}

[The notion that the EU would be well advised to spare Russia prevails
within the Union]{.underline}, not least among the leaders of three
member states. [This stance is not only disrespectful to Ukraine, but
its strategic thinking is fundamentally erroneous and short-sighted, and
even **endangers Europe** in the long term.]{.underline} Recent history
reveals that [indulging a Putin-led Kremlin is not only an impractical
and reckless policy, but prone to placing many European nations in a
position of **dependency** vis--vis Russia, creating **divisions**
between EU member states]{.underline}, and thus, [making the Union
**vulnerable** to Putin's intimidations and pressures]{.underline}.
Calls to avoid Russia's humiliation do not guarantee Europe's security,
but rather strengthen Russia and weaken the EU in the long run.

[Macron's posture relies on the **precedent** set by **post-WWI
Germany**]{.underline}, a nation whose humiliation caused by the
Versailles Treaty is often cited as a driving factor for its return to
the battlefield 20 years later. The takeaway behind this is that deeply
humiliated countries make for bad partners in peace. In this case,
[Macron's phrase reflects an attempt to avoid 'making things
worse']{.underline} and antagonising Russia to an extent that would be
critical for Western democracies.

[However, Russia has undermined Western objectives **even in the
absence** of any **provocation** or **humiliation.**]{.underline} The
[Russian management of the **Syrian issue**, even before]{.underline}
its 2015 [intervention, and its **illegal annexation** of Crimea are
just two illustrations of this reality.]{.underline}

Moreover, [Moscow has repeatedly shown its tendency to use **compromise
frameworks** to leverage **permanent interference** in its neighbours'
affairs]{.underline}, rather than to seek conflict resolution. This was
displayed most recently by the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements, signed as a
means to reunite Ukraine, but distorted by the Kremlin to enshrine a
process that would see Russian-aligned administrations emerge in Luhansk
and Donetsk. Making **[concessions]{.underline}** that [could be used by
an **adversary** to **maximise** its **influence** and further
**escalate destabilisation** abroad is evidently **not** a **clever**
diplomatic strategy -- and not one that Europe should rely
on.]{.underline}

[Putin's demands **contradict** the very nature of what **cooperation
with Europe might entail**]{.underline}

[Behind this appeasement rhetoric lies a **flawed**]{.underline} and
ineffective [strategy for peace]{.underline} that is [based on the
premise that Russia still **adheres** to the post-Cold War status quo
and **seeks to integrate** the European and Western circle.]{.underline}
While this could have been true in the 1990s and the beginning of
Putin's first term as president, [the perspective for improved relations
suffered]{.underline} from the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, the pro-Western
democratic changes in Georgia, Ukraine and to a lesser extent Kyrgyzstan
between 2003 and 2005, and Russia's attack on Georgia in 2008. Any
prospects whatsoever ceased to exist after Putin's 2012 re-election.
Macron's belief in a functioning appeasement strategy for Europe is
effectively ten years outdated.

[Nowadays, Putin's demands **contradict** the very nature of what
**cooperation** with Europe might entail, as made clear by recent
**draft agreements** with the US and NATO. With demands such as **NATO
withdrawal**]{.underline} from eastern Europe [or]{.underline}
officially [**closing the door** on Ukraine]{.underline}'s membership,
[these documents **reinforce** the Russian president's obsessions with
the survival of his regime and the country's geopolitical
might.]{.underline} As seen with Ukraine, [Putin is clearly **willing**
to engage in **hostile actions** and even go to war when he believes
these objectives are threatened or that Russia risks being
humiliated.]{.underline} Here lies the core problem with trying to
appease or indulge Putin's Russia: [as the protagonist, Putin **defines
the rules** of the game.]{.underline} The practice of [**appeasement**
leaves Europe in a position of **weakness**, **vulnerability** and
**ill-preparedness**.]{.underline}

[Rather than passively react]{.underline} to Russia's demands, [the EU
must fortify its voice and **set its own terms** to Russia, even if the
Kremlin will **reject them.** The point is not to get Russia to accept
European terms, it is to **stop playing by Russian rules.**]{.underline}

[This will require European nations to **considerably bolster** their
**stance** vis--vis Russia. This is already being done through NATO,
which]{.underline} significantly [**reinforced** its military
posture]{.underline} on its eastern flank and prepares to welcome Sweden
and Finland to its ranks. But the greatest change needs to occur within
the European Union.

A sense of urgency alone cannot sustain a common sense of purpose and
unify all member states over time

A more secure Europe can emerge only with an EU that is better prepared
to deter -- or face -- Russia politically, economically and militarily.
The Union will thus need to take actions in all three of these domains.

First, it is essential that the EU abandon ambiguity and adopt more
unified rhetoric when addressing foreign policy issues. The relative
speed at which the EU27 managed to agree on sanctions against Russia
following its invasion of Ukraine constitutes grounds for hope; however,
a sense of urgency alone cannot sustain a common sense of purpose and
unify all member states over time. The EU now needs to prioritise its
unity on the international stage.

Second, the EU must be willing and able to protect its interests and
oppose any adversary seeking to undermine its objectives through the use
of economic instruments. Although limited in scope, the EU has only just
started to leverage gas imports to pressure Russia following the
invasion of Ukraine, despite medium and long-term costs for the Union.
The EU must hold its ground and further integrate economic instruments
in its foreign policy toolbox to compel opponents. The fact that the EU
needs Russian gas more than Russia needs European cash is not immutable.

Finally, the EU must endorse its willingness to militarily defend itself
against any potential aggressor. While the military aspect of defence is
and will remain in the hands of NATO, the EU and its member states
should clearly express and demonstrate the will to take up arms if
needed. Moreover, Europe must prove its determination and ability to
defend itself alone; the US cannot, and will not, fight Russia in a
full-scale war at a time when its greatest strategic threat comes from
the Pacific. In its recent 'The Case for EU Defense' report, the Center
for American Progress proposed that the EU must now "focus on developing
and acquiring new capabilities that can enable Europe to act without the
involvement of the U.S. military." Accordingly, the report called for
American leaders to stop opposing EU defence integration initiatives,
maintaining that the current approach encouraged unnecessary
redundancies among EU countries.

[Only with a long-term, coordinated, intensified and complementary
**rearmament strategy** will the EU component of NATO be able to **play
its part** within the alliance]{.underline}

While many EU member states have already increased defence spending in
reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these efforts will now need
to be elevated to the EU level to ensure close coordination between
member states -- an objective also shared by NATO. Only with a
long-term, coordinated, intensified and complementary rearmament
strategy will the EU component of NATO be able to play its part within
the alliance as an effective deterrent force against Russia.

[Instead of debating if it should or shouldn't humiliate a belligerent
nuclear power, the EU must **strengthen itself** to **keep** Russia from
ever **crossing** the **line** as it did with Ukraine not but six months
ago.]{.underline} After all, as John Chipman of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) put it: [**"Humiliation** is a
**mild punishment** for **war crimes."**]{.underline}

[The war in Ukraine has been underway for over four months.]{.underline}
What began as [a European conflict has had **global

the destroyed cities and infrastructure are as high as \$750 billion.

During 2020-21, most economies that could afford to, provided generous
financial support to its citizens in the form of direct payments and
subsidised food to tide over the economic hardships caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chains suffered disruptions, aggravated by
politics. Economic recovery has generated demand, creating inflationary
pressures. Today, [inflation rates are rising]{.underline} across the
world and in the largest economies have reached levels not seen since
the early 1980s. As these countries tighten money supply, [fears of
recession loom large. The war in Ukraine has aggravated the situation
for the poorer countries by creating food and fertilizer
shortages.]{.underline} The sharp surge in energy prices threatens the
prospects of economic recovery. Prospects of collective global action to
deal with these challenges appear remote, given growing tensions among
major powers.

Inflation rates are rising across the world and in the largest economies
have reached levels not seen since the early 1980s.

And so, the war grinds on, with no end in sight.

The inevitable conflict

It is a fact that Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022 in gross
violation of the United Nations Charter and international law; it is
equally true that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is not
an innocent bystander. In 2022, Russia is the guilty one but NATO's
folly was to forget that the cost of its expansion goes up as it gets
closer to the Russian border. Its strategic error was in concluding that
Russia was in terminal decline and adopting an 'open door' policy.

By 2005, 11 former East European and Baltic states had joined NATO.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Russian President
Vladimir Putin described NATO's decision of moving eastwards and
deploying forces closer to Russian borders, "a serious provocation". The
warning was ignored. At the NATO summit in early 2008, the United States
pushed for opening membership for Ukraine and Georgia. France and
Germany, sensitive to Russian concerns, successfully blocked a
time-frame for implementation. As a compromise, it was the worst of both
worlds. It convinced Russia of NATO's hostility and dangled prospects
for Georgia and Ukraine that NATO could not fulfil.

NATO continued to strengthen its relationship with Ukraine by providing
it training and equipment, formalising it in 2020 by making Ukraine a
NATO Enhanced Opportunity Partner.

Later that year, Russia intervened in Georgia on the grounds of
protecting the Russian minorities, taking over the neighbouring
provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2014, following the
Euromaidan protests in Kiev against President Viktor Yanukovych, who was
pro-Russian, Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russia separatists, assisted
by Russian mercenaries, created autonomous regions in eastern Ukraine.
The fuse, lit in 2008, was now smouldering.

Post-2014, NATO continued to strengthen its relationship with Ukraine by
providing it training and equipment, formalising it in 2020 by making
Ukraine a NATO Enhanced Opportunity Partner. The presence of warships
from Britain and the United States began to increase in the Black Sea.
In 2019, the United Kingdom entered into a cooperation agreement with
Ukraine to develop two new naval ports, Ochakiv on the Black Sea and
Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, a move that Russia saw as potentially
threatening. The die was cast.

Liberalism trumps realism

[**Neither side wanted war.** NATO members insist that Ukraine would not
be joining NATO]{.underline} but remains unable to walk back from its
2008 statement. [This would be **seen as 'appeasement'**. In diplomacy,
appeasement had long been accepted as an honourable route to ensuring
peace]{.underline}, practised by the British since the mid-19th century
in its dealings with European powers and especially the U.S. as it
sought to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. Neville Chamberlain too used
appeasement to negotiate "peace in our times" in 1938 but Winston
Churchill employed it to pillory him and the term never regained
respectability thereafter.

An equivalent term surfaced --- sensitivity for each other's core
interests --- practised during the Cold War to prevent the U.S. and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from getting into conflict.
With the end of the Cold War, this became history. The liberal school,
having vanquished the Marxist school of thought, was now convinced of
the righteousness of its cause. If only the rest of the world could be
made to see reason, democracy would flourish, free markets ensure
prosperity and a western-led rule-based order prevail. The triumph of
liberalism led the neo-con believers towards interventionism (Kosovo,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, the Colour Revolutions, Syria); others,
attracted by the prospects of the Chinese and Russian markets, deluded
themselves that economic growth would lead to political openings.

The realist school of thought cautioned against military interventions
backed by a one-size-fits-all democratic prescription and the risks of
excessive economic dependence on China but these voices were dismissed.
Many U.S. scholars and strategic thinkers cautioned against NATO
enlargement, warning that Russia may be weak but it would be reckless to
ignore its security interests; they were charged with 'appeasement'.
Liberalism was upholding 'moral values'; amoral realism was easy to
reject as immoral.

The realist school of thought cautioned against military interventions
backed by a one-size-fits-all democratic prescription and the risks of
excessive economic dependence on China but these voices were dismissed.

French President Emmanuel Macron talked in February of the
Finlandisation model as an option for Ukraine. Austrian neutrality
imposed by the U.S., the USSR, the U.K. and France in 1955, enshrined in
its constitution was mentioned. But these solutions had found acceptance
in a war-weary Europe when politics was frozen by the Cold War. Finland
had accepted limited sovereignty and just two Presidents guided it ---
Urho Kekkonen (1956-82) and Mauno Koivisto (1982-94) and both also
served as Prime Ministers. In 2022, such stability is impossible with
power politics in flux, rivalries sharpening and populism on the
upswing.

In early March, in an interview to Russian media, the Ukrainian
President, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared that Ukraine was not pressing
for NATO membership but wanted neutrality to be guaranteed; he even
talked of autonomy for Donbas as a compromise and a period of 10 years
for talks on Crimea. But that interview was soon forgotten.

How wars end

[Wars often develop their own momentum and the Ukraine war is no
exception. Russia possibly **anticipated** a **short**, sharp conflict,
a **collapse** of the Kiev regime]{.underline} (perhaps similar to what
happened in Kabul last August), and a lack of NATO cohesion. [It has had
to readjust its aims as it has settled down to a long and brutal
war.]{.underline} The G-7, the European Union (EU) and NATO have
displayed unusual cohesion and Ukrainians have shown exemplary grit and
motivation. Russia is in a bind. Even its limited war aims of
controlling Donbas and the Black Sea coast have been a slog. Finland and
Sweden joining NATO will squeeze it further in the Baltic Sea.
[Ukraine's ability to fight **depends on** how long **western funds**
and military hardware keep flowing.]{.underline}

In a moral world, there is a right and wrong and Russia should be held
to account. But in the real world, other factors come into play. A blame
game or establishing the root cause will not help end the crisis.
Eventually, talks will need to take place, between Ukraine and Russia
and with NATO and the U.S. playing an outsize role behind the scenes.
This means acknowledging Russia's security interests in its
neighbourhood.

The G-7, the European Union (EU) and NATO have displayed unusual
cohesion and Ukrainians have shown exemplary grit and motivation.

The problem is that the [war is now being cast in **binaries** --- a
battle between **freedom** and **tyranny**, between democracy and
autocracy, a choice between rule-based order and brute force. This makes
compromise **difficult.**]{.underline} And [Russia **cannot be
defeated** unless NATO wants to engage in a **full-scale
war.**]{.underline}

[The longer the war continues, the greater the suffering
for]{.underline} the [Ukrain]{.underline}ians. [The more territory
Ukraine loses, the **weaker** will be its **bargaining position** at the
table.]{.underline} And the longer the war continues, [the greater the
risk of an **inadvertent escalation.** History tells us that when faced
with choices, major powers have a propensity to **double
down.**]{.underline} The nuclear taboo has held since 1945; sane voices
need to ensure that it is not breached. The sooner the war ceases, the
better it is for Ukrainians, Russians and the world. [It is an
**imperfect world**, but we do not have another.]{.underline}

[Russia will **struggle** to maintain its military campaign and Ukraine
may be able to **hit back**]{.underline}, the head Britain\'s foreign
intelligence service says.

MI6 chief Richard Moore said [Russia had seen ***\"epic fails\"*** in
its initial goals; removing **Ukraine\'s president**, capturing **Kyiv**
and **sowing disunity** in the West.]{.underline}

He was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, in a rare public
appearance.

He called the invasion \"the most egregious naked act of aggression\...
in Europe since the Second World War.\"

He said recent [Russian gains were \"tiny\" and that Russia was \"about
to **run out of steam\".**]{.underline}

\"Our assessment is that [the Russians will increasingly find it
**difficult** to find **manpower** and materiel over the next few
weeks,\"]{.underline} Mr Moore told the conference in Colorado. [\"They
will have to pause in some way and that will give the Ukrainians the
**opportunity** to **strike back.\"**]{.underline}

That view may be seen as optimistic and [Ukraine\'s ability to
counter-attack may well **depend on** greater supplies of **Western
weaponry**, which its officials say has often been **too slow in
arriving.**]{.underline}

The MI6 chief said some kind of [**battlefield success** would be an
**\"important reminder** to the rest of Europe that this is a **winnable
campaign\"** - particularly ahead of a winter which was likely to see
pressure on **gas supplies.**]{.underline}

[\"We are in for a **tough time,\"**]{.underline} he said. [A further
reason to maintain **support** to help the Ukrainians win, or \"at least
**negotiate** from a **position** of **significant
strength\"**]{.underline}, he said, was [because China\'s leader **Xi**
Jinping was **\"watching** like a hawk\".]{.underline}

\"There\'s no evidence that \[President Vladimir\] Putin is suffering
from ill-health,\" he replied when asked, echoing comments from his US
counterpart CIA Director William Burns at the Forum yesterday.

Around 400 Russian intelligence officers operating under cover have been
expelled across Europe, he said, reducing Russia\'s ability to spy in
the continent by half.

\"Our door is always open,\" he said when it came to recruiting
disaffected Russian officials to spy for Britain.

MI6 puts most effort on China

On China, he said MI6 had \"never had any illusions whatsoever about
Communist China\".

He revealed MI6 now devoted more effort to China than to any other
single subject - the effort in this field having just moved past that
devoted to counter-terrorism.

He said it was \"too early to tell\" what lessons China would draw from
Putin\'s actions in Ukraine, but there were lots of signs officials in
Beijing were going into overdrive to work out what they thought. \"It is
quite difficult to read at the moment,\" he said.

He said [it was \"important\" to **remind China\'s leadership** of how
an **invasion of Taiwan** could go wrong.]{.underline} He said [China\'s
leadership **underestimated US resolve** and power and this might **lead
them to miscalculate.**]{.underline} \"I don\'t think it is
inevitable,\" he said when asked about a major conflict.

On Iran, he said a nuclear deal was \"absolutely on the table\", but he
was sceptical that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wanted
to sign a deal.

For all the limitations, he said the previous deal was still the best
means available to constrain the Iranian nuclear programme.

Asked if the Western withdrawal from Afghanistan last year made it
harder to deal with threats, he acknowledged \"this was a reverse for us
when it happened and it is now more difficult\". He said it would
require finding \"different ways\" to deal with the Islamist terrorist
threat, including working with partners who MI6 may not normally deal
with.

Asked to reflect on the state of politics and violence in the United
States, the MI6 chief sidestepped the question, but stressed his \"huge
affection\" for the US, where he had studied and taken his first paid
job as a teenager.

He corrected the interviewer to say this job had been as a beach
attendant rather than a lifeguard. \"I didn\'t have the body for that,\"
he said to laughter from the audience.

#### China-Taiwan war goes nuclear. Deterrence is key. It's fast and more probable than European war.

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

#### There is [still room]{.underline} for NATO involvement\-\--fears of escalation are [unfounded]{.underline}\-\--the US and NATO must adopt a policy of going [just-behind]{.underline} crossing the redline

**Altman 7/12** (Dan Altman; **[\"The West Worries Too Much About
Escalation in Ukraine: NATO Can Do More Without Provoking
Moscow\"]{.underline}**, 7-12-2022, Foreign Affairs,

[As the world looks on while Ukrainians fight for their lives and their
freedom, many feel a **burning desire** to do more to support them. The
problem is not a lack of forces or resources---it is **fear** of
provoking a wider, perhaps **nuclear**, war with Russia.
That]{.underline} fear [is why]{.underline} U.S. President Joe [Biden
and other NATO leaders have consistently made **clear** that they will
**not intervene** directly in the conflict]{.underline}, instead
limiting their help to weapons, money, intelligence, and sanctions. As
devastating as events in Ukraine are today, a nuclear war with Russia
could kill more people than Ukraine's entire population of roughly 44
million.

[NATO leaders understand that they must walk this **fine line** between
aiding Ukraine and risking war with Russia, but they have **no theory**
of **how** to do it.]{.underline} The German and French [governments hem
and haw about whether to provide Ukraine with tanks. When Poland
proposed a]{.underline} plan to transfer [MiG-29 fighter
aircraft]{.underline} to Ukraine, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[refused.]{.underline}** U.S. Defense Department
spokesperson John [Kirby warned that it "raises **serious concerns** for
the entire NATO alliance"]{.underline} and therefore was not "tenable."
[Yet the United States was already shipping Javelin antitank missiles
and Stinger surface-to-air missiles. Soon after, it began sending other
weapons, including M777 howitzers and now HIMARS multiple rocket
launchers. **What is the difference?** Those weapons **do more** to
strengthen Ukraine's combat power]{.underline} than MiG-29s, so the
theory cannot be that Russia reacts more strongly to policies that do
more harm to its interests. Why, then, missiles and artillery but not
planes? [The answer is that there is **no answer**. It is simply
**arbitrary.**]{.underline}

[NATO needs a **strategy** predicated on a theory of what it can do to
aid Ukraine]{.underline} without widening the war to a direct conflict
between it and Russia. [Lessons from past crises point to the
**principles** that should guide such a strategy.]{.underline} History
shows that [NATO would recklessly risk war only by crossing **two**
Russian **redlines**: openly **firing on Russian forces** or **deploying
organized combat units under NATO-member flags** into Ukraine. As long
as NATO stops short of]{.underline} unmistakably crossing [those lines,
it can do more to help Ukraine at an acceptable risk of
war.]{.underline}

[Arms transfers and sanctions are both wholly **consistent** with this
approach]{.underline}, so it is tempting to conclude that [NATO
members]{.underline} are doing all they can. They are not. They [should
**build on current policies** by dispensing with arbitrary limits on the
types of conventional weapons they are providing Ukraine and expanding
sanctions.]{.underline} Moreover, there is a third way to support
Ukraine besides arms and sanctions---one that NATO is neglecting. It is
time for NATO to encourage, organize, and equip its soldiers to
volunteer to fight for Ukraine.

WALKING THE LINE

[NATO should pursue a strategy of **going as far as possible** in
Ukraine **without plainly crossing Russia's
redlines**]{.underline}---meaning refusing to openly attack Russian
forces or send combat units into the country. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**prevailed** in the gravest crises of the Cold
War by using this approach.]{.underline}

The Cold War's first major showdown---the Berlin blockade of
1948--49---evinced this strategy. Although easily able to overwhelm
U.S., British, and French troops in what would become West Berlin---an
enclave deep inside Soviet-occupied East Germany---Soviet leader Josef
Stalin did not seize the territory. To do so would have meant attacking
those troops and thus provoking war. Instead, he imposed a blockade that
choked off food and coal for two million Berliners. When Soviet troops
blocked the roads and railways, [Western leaders declined to attack them
to reopen supply corridors. They resorted to an airlift instead, betting
that Stalin would not attack defenseless transport
aircraft.]{.underline} In the end, the vaunted Berlin airlift succeeded.

More than a decade later, American leaders decided to impose a blockade
in lieu of launching an open attack---this time, during the Cuban
missile crisis in 1962. Angered by the Soviet Union's attempt to sneak
nuclear missiles into Cuba and Moscow's lies about it, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy was initially inclined to destroy the missiles with
airstrikes. He and others around him, however, decided the risks were
too great. Director of Central Intelligence John McCone deemed
airstrikes too risky, writing in a memo that the "consequences of action
by the United States will be the inevitable 'spilling of blood' of
Soviet military personnel." He went on: "This will increase tension
everywhere and undoubtedly bring retaliation against U.S. foreign
military installations." Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev recognized
this, too. According to a transcript of his remarks at a Soviet
Presidium meeting, he feared that a U.S. attack would spark a war: "The
tragic thing---they can attack, and we will respond. This could escalate
into a large-scale war." [Kennedy chose neither to attack nor to accept
the missiles as a fait accompli. He instead **blockaded** Cuba. In
history's gravest nuclear crisis, **neither** leader ordered an
**attack.**]{.underline}

One attack did occur, however, when Soviet generals on the ground in
Cuba decided to launch surface-to-air missiles to shoot down an American
U-2 spy plane that had entered Cuban airspace. The attack killed U.S.
Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., the pilot. Khrushchev's fears of war peaked
at that moment, and Moscow chastised the generals who carried out the
attack. Before retaliating, Kennedy gave diplomacy one last chance.
Shared fears about the implications of that shootdown led both sides to
make concessions that helped resolve the crisis. In the end, the United
States prevailed by taking risks without attacking.

The United States and the Soviet Union also engaged in proxy wars to
avoid attacking each other directly and starting World War III. Both
countries used large-scale arms shipments and sometimes soldiers
fighting as volunteers to support local forces. Designed to avoid
escalation, such covert wars are a common tactic in international
politics. During the Korean War, Soviet pilots secretly fought in the
Chinese air force. Soviet arms equipped North Vietnam, and Soviet
soldiers even operated surface-to-air missile batteries against U.S.
aircraft. Despite its losses, the United States decided to tolerate this
Soviet participation rather than widen either war. The Soviets also
allowed similar behavior from the United States on other battlefields.
When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, for example, the United
States armed and financed the mujahideen resisting it. The Soviet Union
eventually withdrew. As recently as 2018, Russian Wagner Group
mercenaries in Syria unsuccessfully attacked U.S. forces operating
alongside Kurdish forces. The United States did not treat it as an
attack by the Russian government.

HOW FAR CAN NATO GO?

[These examples underscore that pushing as far as possible without
openly attacking is often the **best way** to **compete** while managing
escalation risks. **Creative policymaking** can **engineer options**
that achieve **objectives** without crossing redlines]{.underline}, thus
preventing a wider war. [Providing **intel**]{.underline}ligence [that
Ukrainian forces use]{.underline} to kill Russian [soldiers is **not the
same** as NATO openly attacking Russia, **nor is support in
cyberspace.**]{.underline} Lithuania's restrictions on Russia's use of
its territory to ship goods to Kaliningrad meet this standard. [Even
enlarging NATO]{.underline} to include Finland and Sweden and deploying
forces eastward to defend NATO members bordering Russia [entail
**acceptable risks**]{.underline}; such [actions do **not constitute**
an **attack** on Russia. In fact, there is good reason to think that
**NATO** can **do even more** in Ukraine without provoking a wider
war.]{.underline}

[Some believe that Russia's nuclear weapons]{.underline} and greater
interests in Ukraine [give it the advantage over NATO. This is
**mistaken.**]{.underline} It is true that [NATO leaders prioritize
avoiding war with Russia over aiding Ukraine, but it is just as true
that **war with NATO** would **cost Russia far more** than would abiding
most forms of aid to Ukraine.]{.underline} After all, [Russia is already
struggling mightily against Ukraine.]{.underline} It cannot
simultaneously win a conventional war with NATO. [And no one would win a
nuclear war.]{.underline}

Interests alone do not determine who has the advantage when both sides
wish to avoid war. Instead, [the **advantage** goes to the **side** that
puts the **other** in the **difficult position** of choosing whether to
**escalate** or accept a limited **defeat.** The side that must
**start** the **war** is in the more **difficult position.** Russia has
tolerated]{.underline} NATO's [sanctions]{.underline} and arming Ukraine
[for precisely **that reason.**]{.underline}

RES

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky said last week about Russia's president. "I need to talk to
Putin. [The world **needs** to talk to Putin. There is **no other way to
stop this war**]{.underline}." [The United States should heed this
plea]{.underline}. Ukraine's resistance to Russia's unprovoked and
illegal invasion has been both heroic and effective, but its situation
is precarious. [For all their flaws, Russia's armed forces may yet
prevail in a prolonged conflict, and there is still a real danger that
much of Ukraine will become a Russian vassal state under a puppet
government]{.underline}. Moreover, even if Ukraine can hold off Russian
forces indefinitely, the prospect of forcibly evicting them from its
territory---particularly in the south---is daunting. All the while,
Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's citizens ever more indiscriminately.
But as Zelensky's statement suggests, Ukraine's plan to end this war is
probably not to vanquish the invading forces. Rather, its goal appears
to be to make the prospect of continuing the war, and the occupation
that could follow it, exceptionally painful for Russia---so painful that
Putin comes to view a settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine's
independence as the lesser of two evils. Putin may already be feeling
the pain. The United States believes that Putin embarked on this war
seeking to conquer most or all of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has implicitly
recognized Zelensky's government by demanding, in return for an end to
the war, that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as
Russian territory, and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as independent
states. If Ukrainian forces continue to perform well, Putin will have to
settle for still less and may even have to pay Ukraine reparations.
(Conversely, if Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin will be able
to drive a harder bargain.) Even in the best case, [if Zelensky wants a
negotiated settlement, he will likely have to make significant
concessions to Russia---as he has acknowledged]{.underline}. Any such
concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United
States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The
democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what
price it is willing to pay for an end to the slaughter of its citizens
and the preservation of Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state. [**The
United States and its allies** should support Zelensky in any diplomatic
course he pursues. Indeed, he cannot end the war without them.
**Economic sanctions** on Russia strengthen his hand at the negotiating
table by raising the costs to Russia of continuing to
fight.]{.underline} By the same token, however, [it is **virtually
inconceivable** that Russia would agree to a settlement without
sanctions relief]{.underline}. For this reason, [the United States and
its allies must be prepared to lift sanctions---including on Russia's
central bank---if Russia and Ukraine negotiate and implement a
settlement agreement.]{.underline}

In just thirty minutes on Sunday, Chancellor Olaf **[Scholz put Germany
on a radical new path]{.underline}**. **[In an extraordinary speech made
during a special session of the German parliament on Sunday, Scholz
ended the decades-long Ostpolitik of his Social Democratic
Party]{.underline}** (SPD), [**with immense ramifications for Europe and
NATO**. Ostpolitik, or "eastern policy," was forged in the early 1970s
and intended to bring the Soviet Union politically and economically
closer to Europe]{.underline}. One major component was building a gas
pipeline, which the United States opposed, that West Germany hoped would
bring confidence, stability, and predictability with the USSR. [But
Ostpolitik also meant that Germany's ruling left wing had little
sympathy for dissident movements in communist Eastern Europe, as these
movements upset the Cold War status quo.]{.underline} **[That belief in
having a special relationship with Russia persisted even when President
Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 and annexed Crimea in
2014]{.underline}**. Germany's powerful and influential business lobbies
and pro-Russia left-wingers preferred to protect their interests with
Russia, despite the Kremlin's crackdown on human rights, press freedom,
and civil society. **[Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday was the
last straw for Scholz]{.underline}**. **[He became convinced that
Germany could no longer hedge its bets with Russia]{.underline}**. In
his speech to legislators, he laid out his vision for the country's
radical shift. [Scholz said German defense spending would increase to 2
percent of gross domestic product, meeting the target set in 2014 during
NATO's summit in Wales]{.underline}. [In addition, he announced a
special 100 billion euro]{.underline} (\$113 billion) [fund to provide
much-needed basic equipment for the German armed forces. Scholz also
said Germany would send weapons to Ukraine, ending a long-held policy
that it would not deliver weapons to a conflict
zone]{.underline}---hardly a plausible argument when Germany supplies
weapons to authoritarian regimes. [Finally, the country would move
quickly to reduce its dependence on oil and gas. This means sharply
cutting back its imports of Russian energy, which account for 55 percent
of its gas imports]{.underline}. Apart from mapping out an ambitious new
course for Germany, it was Scholz's impassioned support for Ukraine that
won him rapturous applause. "The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a
watershed in the history of our continent," he said. "With the attack on
Ukraine, Russian President Putin has started a war of aggression in cold
blood." But **[what does Scholz's speech mean in
practice?]{.underline}** First, **[Russia has lost one of its most
important supporters in Europe, and Germany no longer sees Armenia,
Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine through the prism of
Russia.]{.underline}** The time when the SPD tacitly acknowledged
Russia's sphere of influence over these sovereign, independent countries
is over. In addition, Germany's relations, particularly with Poland and
the Baltic states, will markedly improve. [These countries were highly
critical and distrustful of Berlin's commitment to Nord Stream 2, the
\$11 billion project to bring Russian gas directly to Europe that was
finished and awaiting certification when Scholz halted it last
week.]{.underline} **[They, along with Ukraine, believed the pipeline
would increase their vulnerability in terms of energy supplies and make
Germany more dependent on Russia for its energy, pushing Germany to lean
more Russia-friendly inside the EU and NATO]{.underline}**. **[Expect a
thaw in relations]{.underline}**. [Scholz's announcement to send weapons
to Ukraine will also boost Germany's standing in this part of
Europe]{.underline}. Early last month, Germany faced widespread ridicule
over its promise to supply Ukraine with 5,000 helmets, as other NATO
members sent weapons, and it blocked Estonia's move to send German-made
weapons to Kyiv. This policy change ends the long-held suspicion that
Berlin did not want to antagonize Russia. In addition, **[these
decisions are a boost for NATO, with Germany now fully committed to the
defense of Europe via the U.S.-led military alliance]{.underline}**.
[The change shows that Germany no longer wants to be seen as a "free
rider," always relying on the United States to be Europe's security
guarantor without paying much for that security umbrella]{.underline}.
Germany was repeatedly criticized for its unwillingness to spend 2
percent of its gross domestic product on defense, and this raised
questions among allies if Germany was taking America's protection for
granted. One caveat to the increase in defense spending. The 100 billion
euro "special fund" will kickstart a long overdue modernization of
Germany's armed forces. This is no joke: German soldiers were sent
recently to the Baltic states lacking thermal underwear and other basic
clothing. But spending more over the next few years will not be useful
if it leads to more duplication of equipment among allies instead of
focusing on adapting weapons systems to cyber attacks, modern aircraft
fighters, and the changing nature of warfare. **[Germany could now shape
the future direction of EU foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[The war in
Ukraine has shown how the EU, pushed by Germany, needs a revamped
"Eastern Partnership" policy that entails not only reducing Russian
interference, especially by pro-Russian and local oligarchs in politics
and the economy, but also strengthening the state institutions and
combating corruption]{.underline}**. Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine---countries in which Russia has consistently meddled---want to
join the EU, or failing that, some special relationship that will make
their trade, economy, political, and social structures more closely tied
to Europe. **[Scholz's policy change indicates that Germany will no
longer stand in the way of these changes, and could even lead
them]{.underline}**.

A protest note was handed to the German military by the Russian Defense
Ministry in response to comments about deterring Russia's nuclear
capabilities. [Germany especially had been coming out with statements
about the pressing need to focus on Russia and reducing their nuclear
capabilities, causing Russia to deliver the note.]{.underline} According
to Reuters, Russia announced it would break off existing
institutionalized contacts with NATO and the alliance agreed on a new
plan to defend against any potential Russian attack. In an interview
last Thursday, incumbent Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
stated that "[**We have to make it very clear to Russia that in the
end** --- and that is also the deterrent doctrine --- **we are ready to
use** such means \[**nuclear weapons\] so that it has a deterrent**
effect beforehand and nobody gets the idea..."]{.underline} It is
alarming that Germany is quick to state that they would put to use such
weapons against Russia. The spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign
Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that ["there are level-headed people in
the German leadership who can prevent their defence minister from
recklessly wanting to test our armed forces." It is unknown what the
note from Russia stated, but it introduces a possible strife between the
two nations over nuclear power.]{.underline} [Janis Kluge, an expert at
the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, views the
**current relationship between Berlin and Moscow as at an all-time low
in post-Soviet history**. Germany-Russia relations have always been
complicated with shifts from alliances to total warfare. The recent rise
in negative relations stemmed from Russia's seizure of Crimea from
Ukraine in 2014. Within NATO, Germany was quick to impose multiple
rounds of harsh sanctions against oil and other Russian industries. This
**leaves Germany and Russia with unstable relations today**, meaning the
note is **indicative of a possible major conflict between the two**.
**Germany** has **made** an **aggressive threat towards Russia by
stating that they would go as far as to use nuclear weapons in acts of
deterrence**]{.underline}. This puts hundreds of millions of people at
risk, as a deadly conflict would arise if Germany took such severe
action. Germany's initial comments and responses to the situation are
intended to make Russia fearful of an attack and be cautious with their
nuclear program. Weapons of mass destruction like the ones in question
are obviously catastrophic, which pushes the common reaction to often be
the use of them as it is the only way to counter such a massive threat.
It is ironic that many nations choose to fight the problem with further
use of the same weapons. However, nations may not see many alternatives
to preventing the spread of nuclear power as they have to put forth a
large enough and credible type of threat.

[The euro **zone's recovery from the pandemic is already showing signs

way**.]{.underline} The [**danger of a recession loomed into view** this
week after Russia halted gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria,]{.underline}
offering a foretaste of what the region might have in store. But [even
without the energy rationing such a move might provoke, the outlook
looks ominous, underscored by weaker-than-expected growth reported
Friday.]{.underline} European Weakness Inflation and war are weighing on
economic output across the region European Central Bank Chief Economist
Philip Lane insisted after the data that there's "still a lot of
momentum" in the recovery. Even so, [European factories are signaling
distress amid record inflation and a stubborn supply squeeze, aggravated
by strict lockdowns in China]{.underline}. Meanwhile any catch-up on
leisure and travel by Covid-liberated consumers may fade, not least as
price increases eat into incomes. The coronavirus itself could return
with a vengeance. [**European financial markets reflect the gloom**, and
economists at Morgan Stanley are among those seeing a "meaningful
slowdown" in the second half. Corporate giants including Germany's BASF
SE are bracing for "serious disruptions," and the OECD is warning that
governments underestimate the impact of the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}
What that suggests is that a year that began with the region extending
its growth beyond pre-Covid levels, and offered the prospect of further
tailwinds from European Union fiscal aid, now risks becoming another
sorry episode in the single currency's history of frustrating setbacks
to growth. "[The economy may show resilience in the coming quarters, but
the problem is, what will happen at the end of the year]{.underline}?"
said Anatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale SA in London.
"[We don't know what will happen with wage growth and fiscal stimulus in
2023, there's as much concern over China as there is over energy costs,
and it's easy to become pessimistic in light of the war."]{.underline}
Given the backdrop, [Europe's main equity benchmark has struggled to
find its footing this year and widening bond spreads are feeding
concerns that fragmentation will return to the 19-nation euro
zone.]{.underline} First-quarter gross domestic product data didn't
offer cause for hope. [The euro area grew only 0.2%, less than
economists anticipated, hurt by a contraction in Italy, stagnation in
France and weaker-than-expected growth in Spain.]{.underline} Indicators
since then aren't much better. Factory output and new orders are close
to grinding to a halt, and business confidence across major economies
has declined since the start of the year. That's left services to
shoulder the burden, undermined by waning consumer confidence.
["**Manufacturing will be very weak** in the coming months and quite
likely contract in the second quarter]{.underline}," said Veronika
Roharova, an economist at Credit Suisse International, who predicts
euro-area growth of 2.8% this year. Still, "services are strong and
household savings high, the labor market continues to look healthy and
fiscal support is ensuring we won't see a spending slump." Lane of the
ECB, interviewed by Bloomberg Television after the growth data, observed
that it was "not very high admittedly, but still positive." "We know
from the near-time indicators, from what's going on right now, that
there still seems to be reasonable activity right now here at the end of
April," he added. Even so, [**economic forecasts for this year are being
slashed**. The International Monetary Fund cut 1.1 percentage point off
its projection this month and now sees growth of 2.8%. The Institute of
International Finance anticipates just 1% expansion.]{.underline} ECB
officials acknowledged this month that growth risks have increased
"substantially," but they remain optimistic they can deliver an
accelerated exit from crisis-era stimulus to combat inflation at a
record 7.5% in data on Friday. Some policy makers are touting the first
interest-rate increase since 2011 as soon as July, and even Russia's
complete halt of gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria and the prospect
that euro-zone countries could also be shut off next doesn't seems to
deter them. While "this would definitely have a more negative, stronger
immediate effect" Governing Council member Madis Muller said on
Wednesday, he added that "the risk of an economic contraction in the
euro area on the whole is more likely to be small." [The **effect in
Germany, the region's biggest economy, might be more significant**.
First-quarter growth of 0.2% matched expectations, but the Bundesbank
sees a risk of it shrinking nearly 2% this year if the war escalates and
an embargo on Russian coal, oil and gas leads to restrictions on
industry.]{.underline} Scores of companies including BMW AG and
ThyssenKrupp AG have warned earnings could be affected, and utility
Sniper SE said Wednesday that the economic toll of any stoppages in gas
supplies would be "dramatic." German Economy Minister Robert Habeck
insisted this week that a full embargo on Russian oil would be
"manageable." Meanwhile the EU has been discussing new sanctions
targeting the commodity, and Emmanuel Macron's victory in French
presidential elections may reinforce the bloc's cohesion in addressing
challenges together. The ECB also highlighted this month that fiscal
measures to help households cope with surging inflation are helping. The
prospect of such policies being extended, particularly in the event of a
Russian energy shut-off, could provide a cushion for the economy, though
at a cost to public finances. "Fiscal measures, including at EU level,
will help shield the euro area from the impact of the Russian invasion
of Ukraine," ECB President Christine Lagarde told the IMF meetings last
week. The central bank's next policy decision is on June 9.

<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/we-see-a-big-recession-in-the-making-top-ceos-fear-worst-in-europe.html>)

[The **CEOs** of several European blue chip companies have told CNBC
that they **see a significant recession coming down** the pike **in
Europe**.]{.underline} The continent is particularly vulnerable to the
fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war, associated economic sanctions and
energy supply concerns, and economists have been downgrading growth
forecasts for the euro zone in recent weeks. [The euro zone faces
concurrent **economic shocks from the war in Ukraine and a surge in food
and energy prices exacerbated by the conflict**, along with a supply
shock arising from China's zero-Covid policy. That has **prompted
concerns about "stagflation**" --- an environment of low economic growth
and high inflation --- and eventual recession]{.underline}. ["For sure,
**we see a big recession in the mak**ing, but that's exactly what we see
--- it's in the making. There is still an overhanging demand because of
the Covid crisis we just are about to leave," said Stefan Hartung, CEO
of German engineering and technology giant Bosch.]{.underline} "It's
still there and you see it heavily hitting us in China, but you see that
in a lot of areas in the world, the demand of consumers has already even
been increased in some areas." In particular, Hartung noted lingering
consumer demand for household appliances, power tools and vehicles, but
suggested this would dissipate. ["That means for a certain amount of
time, this demand will still be there, even while we see the interest
increase and we see the pricing increase, but at some point in time, it
won't be just a supply crisis, it will also be a demand crisis, and then
for sure, **we are in a deep recession**," he added. Inflation in the
euro zone hit a record high of 7.5% in March]{.underline}. So far, the
European Central Bank has remained more dovish than its peers, such as
the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, both of which have
begun hiking interest rates in a bid to rein in inflation. However, the
ECB now expects to conclude net asset purchases under its APP (asset
purchase program) in the third quarter, after which it will have room to
begin monetary tightening, depending on the economic outlook. Berenberg
Chief Economist Holger Schmieding said in a note Friday that near-term
risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside in Europe.
["Worsening Chinese lockdowns and cautious consumer spending in reaction
to high energy and food prices could easily cause a temporary
contraction in Eurozone GDP in Q2," Schmieding said.]{.underline} "[An
immediate embargo on gas imports from Russia (highly unlikely) could
turn that into a more serious recession]{.underline}. If the Fed gets it
badly wrong and catapults the U.S. straight from boom to bust (unlikely
but not fully impossible), such a recession could last well into next
year. Yet Schmieding suggested that the euro zone is likely to enter
recession only "if worse came to worst," and that it isn't a base
expectation. Mark Branson, president of German financial regulator
BaFin, said [any military escalation in Ukraine or further energy supply
disruption could pose serious risks to growth in Europe's largest
economy, with industrial sectors particularly vulnerable.]{.underline}
["We're already seeing that growth is down to around zero in many
jurisdictions, including here, and it's vulnerable. It's also vulnerable
from the ongoing Covid-related shocks," he said. "**We've got inflation
that's going to need to be tackled**, and it's going to need to be
tackled now, so that's a cocktail which is difficult for the
economy."]{.underline}

taken similar steps in response to accusations of atrocities committed
by Russian forces against civilians in Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry
said the decision was made in line with the Vienna Convention on

Since Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, [**the EU has adopted six
packages of sanctions against Moscow** -- and we are about to finalise a
"maintenance and alignment" package to clarify a number of provisions to
strengthen legal certainty for operators and align the EU\'s sanctions
with those of our allies and partners of the G7.]{.underline} Our
measures already now target nearly 1,200 individuals and almost 100
entities in Russia as well as a significant number of sectors of the
Russian economy. [These sanctions were adopted in close coordination
with the G7 member, and the fact that over forty other countries,
including traditionally neutral countries, have also adopted them or
taken similar measures enhances their effectiveness.]{.underline}
Sanctions require strategic patience because it may take a long time for
them to have the desired effect. Now, as the war drags on and the costs
of energy rises, people in Europe and elsewhere ask whether these
sanctions are working and/or whether the side effects are too great.
Without underestimating different problems that could occur, including
attempts made to bypass them, sanctions remain an important instrument
of political action. But for sure [we need to use them in a well
targeted manner, and, above all, **they require strategic patience
because it may take a long time for them to have the desired
effect.**]{.underline} [One of the main sanctions adopted is to stop
buying 90% of EU oil supplies from Russia by the end of 2022, depriving
Moscow of corresponding revenues.]{.underline} Yes, Russia is able to
sell its oil to other markets, however this benefit is limited by the
fact that Russia is forced to give high discounts on each barrel
(Russian oil is sold at around \$ 30 less than the global average). In
addition, and this is perhaps the most important point, [this gradual
oil embargo and the scaling back of the import of gas, liberates Europe
from its energy dependence on Russia.]{.underline} We have discussed
this issue at the EU level for years, but now we are implementing it.
[Cutting our structural energy dependence on Russia matters a lot
because **this dependence has been an obstacle to developing a strong
European policy** towards Moscow's aggressive actions.]{.underline}
Cutting our structural energy dependence on Russia matters a lot because
this dependence has been an obstacle to developing a strong European
policy towards Moscow's aggressive actions. This dependence probably
played an important role in Putin\'s initial calculations in Ukraine. He
may have believed that the EU would never sanction Russia seriously
because it was too dependent on energy. This is one of his most
important blunders when launching this war. [Of course, this rapid
detoxification from Russian energy involves significant costs for a
number of countries and sectors that we will have to face. However, it
is the price to pay to defend our democracies and international law. We
have to handle these consequences by **reinforcing our internal
solidarity** and that is what we are doing.]{.underline} By breaking its
energy dependence, in line with its climate ambition, the EU is learning
that interdependence is not always a neutral instrument that is
beneficial to all or a mean to guarantee peaceful international
relations. The Ukraine war confirmed that interdependence can be used as
a weapon. This rapid detoxification from Russian energy involves
significant costs for a number of countries and sectors that we will
have to face. However, it is the price to pay to defend our democracies
and international law. Are the sanctions really hurting the Russian
economy? Some observers have argued they are not very effective because
the exchange rate of the Russian currency is very high. But this
interpretation is dubious. [**The exchange rate of the Rouble simply
reflects the fact that Russia has a massive imbalance between the high
volume of oil and gas exports and the parallel collapse of imports that
has followed the sanctions.** This trade surplus is not a sign of good
economic health, especially for an economy like Russia. While exporting
unprocessed raw materials, Russia must import many high-value products
that it does not manufacture.]{.underline} For advanced technology
products, Russia depends on Europe for more than 45%, the United States
for 21% and China for only 11%. Russia may of course try to limit the
effects of sanctions by substituting imports through domestic products.
This was done, not without success, in the agricultural sector after the
2014 sanctions. However, for high-tech products, import substitution is
much more difficult to achieve. [**Russia will try to substitute imports
through domestic products.** This was done, not without success, in the
agricultural sector after the 2014 sanctions. However, for high-tech
products, it is much more difficult to achieve.]{.underline} Sanctions
on semiconductors imports for instance have a direct impact on Russian
companies that produce consumer electronics, computers, airplanes, cars,
or military equipment. In this field, which is obviously crucial in the
war in Ukraine, sanctions limit Russia\'s capacity to produce precision
missiles. On the ground, the Russian army is not making much use of this
type of precision-guided missiles, not out of moderation, but out of
necessity, as it does not have enough of them. In addition, the Russian
air force has underperformed in Ukraine, also because it lacks
precision-guided munitions. The automotive sector is another sector that
is very much feeling the effects of the sanctions. Almost all foreign
manufacturers have decided to withdraw from Russia and production was
last May down by 97% compared with 2021. In addition, the few cars that
Russian manufacturers still produce will not have airbags or automatic
gearboxes. The Russian oil industry will suffer Russia as the world's
second largest oil producer is still earning large sums from selling its
oil worldwide, notably to Asian customers and this helps it to keep
financing the war. But over time, [the Russian oil industry will suffer
not only from the departure of foreign operators but also from its
**increasing difficulty in accessing sophisticated technologies** such
as horizontal drilling. In fact, the capacity of Russia to put new wells
in production will be limited, which will lead to a drop in
production]{.underline}. Finally, there is the airline industry, which
plays a very important role in such a vast country. Around 700 of
Russia\'s 1,100 civilian aircraft are of foreign origin. Russia will
have to sacrifice a large part of its fleet, to find spare parts, so
that the remaining aircrafts can fly. Even the Russian-produced
aircrafts are dependent on technologies and material from western
countries. As Alexander Morozov, the head of the research department of
Bank of Russia recently wrote: "[**The restrictions will lead to
decreases in technological and engineering sophistication** and in
labour productivity in the sanctioned industries. Industries that rely
on the most advanced foreign technologies and those with highly
digitalized business processes risk being hit harder than
others]{.underline}". The list could go on with other important factors:
the loss of access to financial markets; the disconnection of Russia
with the major global research networks such as CERN for example; the
massive brain drain of Russian elites with thousands of highly qualified
professionals having left the country. The effects of such moves are not
immediately visible. However, the scientific, economic and technological
isolation of Russia is a major loss for the country in the medium term.
The scientific, economic and technological isolation of Russia is a
major loss for the country in the medium term. Moscow may claim that its
relations with many countries remain intact. However, in reality,
[**sanctions against Russia are also hurting its trade** with
non-sanctioning countries like China. The alternative offered by China
to the Russian economy remains indeed limited.]{.underline} Although
Beijing seems to want to make ideological gestures by siding with
Moscow; refusing to condemn its invasion; or taking up the Russian
narrative on the threat of NATO, it is overall rather careful regarding
helping Russia circumvent the sanctions. While its imports from Russia
have risen (mainly through greater energy imports), Chinese exports to
Russia have decreased in proportions that are comparable to those of
Western countries. Even if it does not admit it publicly, China is
probably worried that this war could strengthen the position of the
United States not only in Europe but also in Asia, with the strong
involvement of countries such as Japan and South Korea in responding to
Russia's aggression. This is not exactly what China is aiming at. As a
result, [the latest Russian figures released by Bank of Russia show that
transactions through **the Russian payment system are down 7.2%** in
June compared to the first quarter of 2022. This is a real-time
indicator of the important slowdown in the Russian economy]{.underline}.
Of course the biggest question of all is this: will the sanctions and
the real effects they have, lead Putin changing his strategic
calculations and if so when? Here we need to be cautious and recognise
that his actions have always been disconnected from economic
considerations. Putin believes in the magical power of political
voluntarism. However, this cannot last forever. Hence Europe must show
strategic patience. The war will be long and the test of strength will
last. We have no other choice. [**Allowing Russia to prevail would mean
allowing it to destroy our democracies** and the very basis of the
international rules-based world order.]{.underline} Europe must show
strategic patience. The war will be long and the test of strength will
last. Allowing Russia to prevail would mean allowing it to destroy our
democracies and the very basis of the international rules-based world
order. [Even if sanctions do not change the Russian trajectory in the
short-term, that does not mean they are useless for they do affect sheer
amount of resources it has to wage its war.]{.underline} Without
sanctions, Russia would 'have its cake and eat it', as the expression
goes. With sanctions, [it **will be forced to "choose between butter and
guns"** locking Putin in a vice that is gradually
tightening.]{.underline} Finally, let me raise here as well the issue of
the alleged or real impact of our sanctions on third countries,
particularly African countries, which depend on Russian and Ukrainian
wheat and fertilisers. Here it is very clear where responsibility lies
for the food crisis. Our sanctions do not target Russian wheat or
fertiliser exports. And it is until now Russia's aggression and its
blockade of the Black Sea that is preventing Ukraine from exporting its
wheat. We hope however that the negotiations led by the Secretary
General of the United Nations will enable this issue to be resolved
quickly. I have informed my African counterparts that we are ready to
assist them with any difficulties they may encounter related with our
sanctions while urging them not to be fooled by the Russian
authorities\' lies and disinformation regarding this subject. I have
informed my African counterparts that we are ready to assist them with
any difficulties they may encounter related with our sanctions while
urging them not to be fooled by the Russian authorities\' lies and

going on internationally over who is responsible global food and energy
crisis as was clear at the last G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting. [But the
real answer is to **bring an end to the war and this can only be
achieved by Russia\'s withdrawal from Ukraine.** I keep reminding all
our international partners that respect for the territorial integrity of
states and the non-use of force are not Western or European
principles.]{.underline} They are the basis of all international law and
Russia is blithely trampling on them. To accept such a violation would
open the door to the law of the jungle on a global scale. Europe must
become a real power The war in Ukraine makes clear that, contrary to
what many thought rather naively just a few years ago, economic
interdependence does not automatically guarantee peaceful international
relations. This is why Europe must become a real power, as I have been
calling for since the beginning of my mandate. Faced with the invasion
of Ukraine, we have moved from debates to concrete actions, showing
that, when provoked, Europe can respond. [Since we do not want to go to
war with Russia**, economic sanctions and the support of Ukraine are at
the core of this response**. And our sanctions are beginning to have an
effect and will do so even more in the months to come.]{.underline}

#### Russia Iran relations decreasing now 

**Fathollah-Nejad 22** (Dr. Ali Fathollah-Nejad is an Associate Fellow
and the author of the Iran in Focus brief at the Issam Fares Institute
for Public Policy & International Affairs (IFI) at the American
University of Beirut (AUB), March 21, 2022, "Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine and the nature of Iranian-Russian relations",
https://www.mei.edu/publications/russias-invasion-ukraine-and-nature-iranian-russian-relations)

However, the Islamic Republic's pro-Kremlin narrative has not remained
unchallenged. [There have been important cracks even with some major
media outlets and especially so across Iranian society. Those seeking to
bring forth counter-narratives, however, face daunting
obstacles.]{.underline} Russian tutelage over Iranian media reporting
--- a demonstration of neo-colonialism After the Russian embassy in
Tehran condemned a report by the Tasnim News Agency --- which,
curiously, is affiliated with the pro-Moscow IRGC --- as "fake news" for
characterizing Putin's operation in Ukraine as an "invasion," the report
was taken offline and replaced with one that closely mirrors the
Kremlin's official wording. In another instance, the embassy lashed out
against an Iranian reformist daily that criticized Russia for
threatening to derail the JCPOA negotiations. Later, on March 9,
[Russia's ambassador to Tehran held a press conference urging Iranian
media not to use the terms "war" or "invasion" in their coverage, a
blatant interference in Iranian domestic affairs that has stoked anger
in the country.]{.underline} These cases bring to mind similar
interventions by China's embassy in Iran against unfavorable media
reporting and official statements, most recently about China's alleged
stationing of security forces in Iran to protect its investment
interests. Earlier, in the pandemic's first year, the Chinese embassy
had stepped in to silence skeptics of Beijing's official COVID-19
statistics. Such [interference by ambassadors from both non-Western
great powers into Iran's domestic affairs reflects the nature of
Tehran's relations with Russia and China, upon which Iran's entire "look
to the East" geopolitical strategy depends. A yawning power gap results
in chronic Iranian weakness and dependency, raising the specter of a
neo-feudal arrangement whereby Tehran's leadership follows the diktats
of their masters in Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}. However, Russia's
newfound pariah status may improve Iran's standing in bilateral ties,
but only if Tehran plays its cards carefully and doesn't degenerate into
a power that simply follows Putin's whims. At its core, Iran's "look
East" policy has as its goal not only economic development and political
support against Western pressure, but the very survival of a regime
whose domestic support has been hollowed out. Moscow and Beijing hold up
this teetering regime from the outside. Hence, the Islamic Republic
finds itself granting concessions to Russian or Chinese interests, and
sometimes even trying to anticipate their apparent desires. In this
context, fears associated with Iran's already signed 25-year
comprehensive cooperation agreement with China are mirrored by those
over the planned 20-year deal with Russia. Both long-term agreements,
which are branded as "strategic," lack transparency and have therefore
stoked wild speculation. Theories abound that the Islamic Republic's
leadership is potentially selling out the country only to cement its own
power amid unprecedented domestic and international pressures with the
help of these non-Western great powers and their U.N. Security Council
vetoes. As a core pillar of the deal with Russia, which Iran's foreign
ministry said last December was "almost finalized," Moscow will
reportedly protect Tehran's interests at the U.N. Security Council and
with the JCPOA, and finally provide it with advanced military hardware
(such as the S-400 missile defense system and Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets)
in exchange for Russia obtaining favorable deals on Iran's oil and gas
fields. Coinciding with this 20-year agreement is another reported deal
between the two countries from last fall, granting Russian companies the
largest share in the recently discovered giant Chalous gas field in
Iran's Caspian Sea territory (followed by Chinese companies and only
then Iranian ones, more concretely those affiliated with the IRGC). For
Russia, Iran has been a true trump card, enabling it to leverage the
"Iranian threat" vis--vis the West while also benefitting economically
from ties with Tehran, including re-energizing its nuclear industry
through its prominent role in Iran's nuclear program. Therefore, if Iran
normalizes relations with the West, that would likely sharply curtail
Russia's influence. In other words, a Western-oriented Iran would
constitute a larger threat to Moscow's interests than a "nuclear Iran."
Societal and geopolitical concerns [The nature and possible
ramifications of Iran's relationship with Russia are hotly debated
across Iranian society. Iranian fears emerge from the unevenness of
bilateral ties and the perceived disconnect between national and regime
interests vis--vis Russia --- or China for that matter.]{.underline}
These concerns about Russia are rooted in both history and geopolitical
realities. [The bitter memories of the 1908 bombardment of Iran's
parliament by the Russia-led Persian Cossack Brigade meant to torpedo
the Constitutional Revolution as well as the 1941 Anglo-Soviet invasion
linger in the collective consciousness as a reminder of the Kremlin's
willingness to run roughshod over Iran in pursuit of its interests.
Moreover, some elements of Iran's foreign policy community see Russia as
flip-flopping when it comes to the perennial conflict between Iran and
the West. For them, Moscow is an opportunistic actor focused solely on
achieving its own aims, even if it means contradicting official rhetoric
that lambasts the U.S. and the West, including its propensity to keep
the flame of the Iran-West conflict alive as a means to maximize
Moscow's standing in that conflictual triangular
relationship]{.underline}. Among other things, Russia is accused of
breaking arms supply contracts, sabotaging the JCPOA process, and
maintaining close ties with Iran's regional foes (Israel, the United
Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia). Furthermore, there are also broader
concerns within society over the long-term alliance the Iranian regime
hopes to forge with the like-minded autocracies of Russia and China.
Although sparsely attended, [anti-war protests in front of the Ukrainian
embassy in Tehran, complete with chants of marg bar Putin ("death to
Putin"), illustrate the anti-Moscow sentiment]{.underline}. Such
reservations about Russia also pertain to China. Yet there is no
organized opposition to the regime's deepening of ties with either. The
interests of the regime and those of Iranian society clash over Russia.
While the former sees Russia as a formidable military-security guarantor
of its stability and survival, the latter sees in such support a looming
threat to democratic aspirations. [Pro-democracy Iranians fear that
Moscow could boost their country's repressive apparatus, and potentially
even deploy its military if popular protests ever were to imperil the
regime --- as witnessed in both Syria and Kazakhstan]{.underline}. The
relationship between the Russian and Iranian regimes is also
strengthened by their parallels: Both are petro-states with mafia-style
ruling classes helmed by all-powerful autocrats unafraid of using a
heavy hand and guided by their nostalgia for the glory days of empires
past.

#### Relations are [impossible]{.underline}\-\--[centuries]{.underline} of bad blood. 

Michael **Rubin 21**, Senior Fellow at AEI, 12/2/2021, "Why the
Russia-Iran Alliance Will Backfire,"
<https://www.aei.org/articles/why-the-russia-iran-alliance-will-backfire/>,
RES

[For all its talk of leading a "resistance front," the Islamic Republic
of Iran has historically had few allies.]{.underline} When Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini led his revolutionaries, "Neither East nor West but
Islamic Republic" was a foundational slogan of the Islamic Revolution.
[Khomeini also described the United States and Russia as being "**two
blades of the same scissors**."\[1\] He meant it: While the seizure of
the U.S. embassy in Tehran symbolized the Islamic Republic's hostility
toward the United States and its European allies, Khomeini was **equally
distrustful of the Soviet Union** and its eastern bloc
satellites.]{.underline} Iran's isolation was cemented when every Arab
state with the exception of Syria sided with Iraq during their 1980-88
war. Tehran's ties with Damascus have remained tight, but Syria's
influence is limited inside the Middle East and its diplomatic weight is
nonexistent outside it. The Iranian authorities sought to cultivate
African states and were able to purchase the occasional vote on an
international body, but Tehran's declining resources limited its
success. [Today, that isolation is over. Whereas Khomeini was wary lest
Moscow take advantage of Iran's vulnerability, Ali Khamenei, who
succeeded him in 1989, took the risk to align with Russia in pursuit of
a broader, anti-U.S. agenda. In this, he found success. But, the
question for Iranians is, at what cost? Distrust **Centuries** in the
Making]{.underline} Iranian leaders were aware of Russia by the
fifteenth century as many European traders, seeking to bypass the
Ottoman Empire on their overland journeys into Asia, traveled to Persia
via Moscow.\[2\] Iranians worried little about their distant neighbors
to the north: they viewed Russians as illiterate and cultureless
peasants and worried more about Uzbeks and the independent khanates of
the Central Asian steppes, which occasionally raided into Iran. The
Russians were equally uninterested in the Persians. Russian tsar Peter
the Great (r. 1682-1725) withdrew Russian troops from the Caspian coast,
believing Iranian forces posed little threat. Such neglect would be
short-lived. In 1796, Catherine the Great (r. 1762-96) sent a
50,000-strong force into the North Caucasus, which at that time was part
of Iran. Her death gave Iran a reprieve and saved it from what might
have been a far greater conquest. As the Russians conquered more
territory in Asia, British leaders grew increasingly concerned about the
security of India and, by extension, Iran, which had become the only
power separating Russia from India. It was this fear that led London to
first dispatch an ambassador to the shah's court in 1800. Both the
Russians and the French soon followed suit. It was not long before
disputes between Moscow and Tehran resumed. [Between 1804 and 1813,
Iranian and Russian forces fought repeatedly in the
Caucasus]{.underline}. The campaigns drained the shah's treasury and, in
the end, the Russians forced him to cede much of what today is the
Republic of Azerbaijan and eastern Georgia. Resentment simmered, and [in
1826, the Iranians attacked Russia to regain what the shah had
lost]{.underline}. [The gamble failed and, in the 1828 Treaty of
Turkmenchai, the shah ceded much of Armenia. For Iranians, these were
not some peripheral territories but rather part of the heartland and the
territory over which the crown prince would serve as
governor]{.underline}. [In 1829, an Iranian mob sacked the Russian
embassy in Tehran, slaughtering its thirty-seven Russian
diplomats]{.underline}.\[3\] Russia became a favorite bogeyman for both
nationalists and clergy, [and Russians in Iran suffered occasional **mob
violence** over subsequent decades]{.underline}.\[4\] Still, the Russian
government saw commerce as a source of influence and encouraged
businessmen to move to Iran. Russian leaders, like their British
competitors, also sought to further their leverage with debt traps: Both
powers would tempt the shah with loans to fund his profligate lifestyle
but then call in their extortionate terms, the expense of which the shah
would often pass to his subjects. [This led to a pattern in which the
Russian rulers often successfully wooed the shah while Iranian public
opinion continued to harden against them.]{.underline} The
Twentieth-century Unrest The twentieth century's first decade was a time
of upheaval in both Russia and Iran. First, the Japanese defeated Russia
in war, ending Moscow's image of invincibility. Then, first in St.
Petersburg and then across Iran, revolutionaries successfully won
parliamentary constraints on monarchies. In Iran, Muzaffar ad-Din Shah
conceded to a constitution just five days before his death. His
successor, Mohammed Ali Shah, was unhappy to see what he believed to be
his birthright diluted before he could even take power. He quickly
turned to Russia where Tsar Nicholas II also sought to preserve his
traditional powers. [As the shah worked to consolidate power and roll
back reforms, the Russian government worked to cement its position in
Iran.]{.underline} Mohammed Ali Shah continued the practice of tax
farming and office selling, so Russian officials used their resources to
ensure pro-Russian candidates won advantageous positions, much to the
chagrin of more liberal Iranian nationalists in Tehran's new
parliament.\[5\] The 1907 Anglo-Russian convention divided Iran into
spheres of British and Russian influence. An editorial cartoon of the
time depicts the Russian bear sitting on Persia while the English lion
looks on. The Russians were blatant in their disrespect of Iranian
sovereignty. On August 31, 1907, they shocked Tehran when they,
alongside their British competitors, unveiled the Anglo-Russian
convention, which effectively divided Iran into spheres of influence.
While Iranians remained angry at both parties for the affront,
[Britain]{.underline}'s main strategic interest at the time was its
telegraph lines across southern Iran, and so it [ceded most major
Iranian population centers to Russian control]{.underline}. [Here, the
Russians chafed the population more, using proxies and pressure to force
closure of Iran's nascent civil society groups and secret societies and
to impose broader censorship on Iran's exploding newspaper
scene.]{.underline} Even the affront of Russia's secret agreement to
divide Iran into different spheres did not break Mohammed Ali Shah's
tilt toward Russia. His ambitions were too great and so, in December
1907, he made his move against the Iranian Constitutionalists. His
guards---and a detachment of Russian-trained Persian
Cossacks---surrounded the parliament. Parliament's supporters resisted
and [soon Iran was on the brink of **civil war**]{.underline}. As far as
most Iranians were concerned, there were two sides: nationalists and
Russian-backed Iranian autocrats. That perception largely remains
unchanged today. Fighting erupted in July 1909 and, within two weeks, it
was over. The shah and his retinue fled first to the Russian embassy and
then to Russia itself. The nationalists put Ahmad, the shah's
12-year-old son, on the throne. Still, Mohammed Ali Shah did not give
up. Two years later and, again with Russian support, he invaded Iran
from the north. He failed, but [the episode cemented Russia's reputation
inside Iran as **hostile to Iranian sovereignty**]{.underline}. [During
World War I,]{.underline} Russian forces drove south from the Caspian
Sea reaching as far south as Qom. By 1917, British and [Russian forces
had occupied most of Iran]{.underline}, leaving Mohammed Ali Shah as a
titular leader. Grievance went beyond bruised pride. [During World War
I, Iran lost more than **20 percent** of its population to disease,
famine, and violence. The Soviets refused to leave Iranian territory
following World War II]{.underline} and supported Kurdish separatism in
Iran during the Cold War. The Bolshevik Revolution did not change the
uneven power dynamic. In 1921, the Soviet authorities imposed a new
treaty on Iran in which Moscow renounced earlier agreements and forgave
Russian loans but also reserved the right to intervene should Iran host
forces intent on interfering in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities
interpreted this literally and, within weeks, Moscow demanded that
Tehran expel all Germans. [Joseph Stalin would repeatedly cite the
treaty to justify Soviet ultimatums.]{.underline} Indeed, Stalin used
the 1921 Treaty to justify invading Iran two decades later. The Soviets
were not alone in this---British and subsequently U.S. forces took
part---but the Red Army was alone in refusing to leave Iranian territory
when World War II ended. Not only did Iranian Azerbaijan become the
focal point of the first Cold War crisis, but Moscow also sought to
encourage and support Kurdish separatism in the Mahabad Republic in
northwestern Iran. This was high among the reasons why Tehran tripled
its defense budget in the next decade and joined the Baghdad Pact.\[6\]
[The direct **military threat** the Iranians felt from across their
1,100-mile border with the Soviet Union loomed large in public
consciousness through the remainder of the Cold War]{.underline}. [This
is why, even as Ayatollah Khomeini railed against "The Great Satan"
America during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, his suspicions and those of
his followers remained just as deep toward the Soviet
Union]{.underline}.\[7\] Reconsidering Russia While Khomeini did not
waiver on his connection to Russia throughout the Iran-Iraq war despite
the isolation Tehran faced, toward the end of his life, he signaled
Iran's need not to treat the Soviet Union with the same enmity as the
regime did the United States. In May 2009, Hassan Rouhani, at the time a
former secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and a member
of the Assembly of Experts, spoke at a roundtable on "Iran, Russia, and
the West."\[8\] While critical of Moscow's posture toward Iran prior to
the Islamic Revolution, he suggested then-parliamentary speaker Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's 1989 visit to Moscow had laid the foundation
for a new partnership.\[9\] Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as
supreme leader, continued Tehran's quiet outreach justified on shared
enmity with the Russians toward Washington and on economic opportunism.
Some Iranians raised questions about inherent ideological compromise,
but regime officials tried to explain this away. In 2012, for example, a
website affiliated with the supreme leader denied any parallels between
the Palestinian plight and Muslim minorities in Russia or China. The
difference, it said, was that Israel was alone in having "confiscated"
Palestinian lands.\[10\] Other outlets acknowledged the problem but
assured critics that Tehran continued to provide "emotional support" for
the Chechens.\[11\] That same year, however, Rafsanjani---by then a
senior statesman---threw cold water on the comfort some Iranian
officials felt about their anti-U.S. alliance with Russia even if he was
credited with its revival. In an interview, he noted the constraints
Russia felt from U.S. pressure and acknowledged, "Like Western
countries, Russia is also concerned about Iran becoming a power by
acquiring nuclear weapons."\[12\] As president, however, Rouhani
disagreed, arguing both that the growing U.S. military presence in
Afghanistan and the Caucasus and U.S. human rights advocacy provoked
Russia enough to cause it to put other concerns aside.\[13\] Other
officials were less sure. In 2014, Behrouz Nemati, a conservative who
represents Tehran in parliament, said that the [history of Russo-Iranian
relations demonstrates a tendency toward Russian subterfuge and warned
Iranian leaders to be careful "shaking Russia's
hand."\[]{.underline}14\] [Russian soldiers stand watch over Afghans
during the Soviet invasion]{.underline}, December 1979. Former Iranian
president Hashemi Rafsanjani claimed that the invasion "[left a **bad
memory** of Russians in Iranians' minds."]{.underline} In contrast to
Rouhani, Rafsanjani suggested that Afghanistan remained a source of
distrust between Tehran and Moscow rather than a catalyst for tighter
ties. "The Soviet Union's record on invading Afghanistan left a bad
memory of Russians in Iranians' minds," he explained. "It is too often
overlooked that the Islamic Republic's relationship with Russia was
formed in such an environment."\[15\] Sadegh Kharrazi, Iran's former
ambassador to France, also cast doubt on a Russian gamble.
"Historically, there is a national distrust in Iranians' nature against
Russia. We haven't been harmed by Americans like we have been by
Russians," he argued.\[16\] This appears to be a common attitude among
some senior Iranian diplomats. Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador
to China, wrote that Russia was not trustworthy. "The Russians are good
to Iran as long as it is in their interest," he explained, but "as soon
as Americans and Western countries \[court Russia\], \[the Russians\]
will turn their back to their commitments to the Islamic Republic of
Iran. ... History has shown whenever we have relied on them
\[Russians\], they have immediately abandoned us," he added.\[17\] One
Iranian diplomat argued, "[The Russians are good to Iran as long **as it
is in their interest**]{.underline}." While Khamenei and later Rouhani
may have been eager for ties to Moscow, Russia's historical baggage in
Iran continued to intrude. Both countries supported the same side in the
Syrian civil war, and yet, when a Russian ship launched cruise missiles
from the Caspian Sea into Syria that overflew Iranian territory, even
sympathetic Iranians such as senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) reacted with outrage.\[18\] [Other Russian actions
have antagonized ordinary Iranians]{.underline}. After Moscow provided
its Iranian counterpart with technology to jam Persian-language
broadcasts from diaspora stations, ordinary Iranians reacted with
vitriol. Internet commentary submitted to the conservative daily [Asr-e
Iran webpage on the story included comments such as, "**May God give
Russia Death," "Russia is the biggest jerk," and "the Russian embassy is
a nest of spies**]{.underline}."\[19\] Outside the constraints of the
official press, Iranian bloggers let loose, questioning the value of
alignment with a declining economic power and the stability of any
alliance with Russia.\[20\] An Iranian doctoral student in Moscow,
meanwhile, observed---correctly---that the Kremlin always acted in its
own national interest, but Iranian proponents of the alliance somehow
expected the Russians to act in Tehran's national interest
instead.\[21\] [Can Trade Overcome Distrust?]{.underline} While
Washington and its Middle Eastern allies may worry primarily about
Russia-Iran military ties, the trade relationship between the two
countries could potentially be broader. Upon the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Russia entered a deep, multi-year recession. At the time, Tehran
was already heavily sanctioned and, after a series of executive orders
issued by President Bill Clinton, soon became more so. Both Tehran and
Moscow, however, found an outlet in the other. In 1995, for example,
Russia's Atomstroyexport became the chief contractor for the Bushehr
nuclear program at a time when few countries wanted Russian nuclear
assistance given the stigma of the Chernobyl disaster, and Iranian
contracts were toxic for Western firms. Still, initial optimism in
Tehran that Russian trade might salvage Iran's economy quickly faded. In
2012, Rafsanjani explained, In the past quarter century ... [Iran and
Russia have **never** been able to set and create a visible trade
partnership. The most important commodity \[oil\] that Iran has to offer
other countries is **not attractive** to the Russians, and many Russians
commodities and technologies have always been the lowest priority for
the Iranian side]{.underline}.\[22\] Russian exports to Iran decreased
by nearly two thirds, from \$3.4 billion to \$1.2 billion, between 2010
and 2013, while Iranian exports to Russia grew only modestly and
remained under \$500 million.\[23\] Nor did either country's
non-military trade with the other increase appreciably over the next
decade.\[24\] Even the arms trade did not fully reassure those in the
Iranian government unsure about whether to trust Moscow. In 2007, Tehran
agreed to purchase the S-300 system for \$800 million. Prior to the
development of the S-400, the S-300 was still Russia's premier
anti-aircraft missile system, and so the announcement of the deal was a
high stakes affair. Soon, however, Iranians who expressed doubt about
Russia's reliability felt vindicated: Moscow suspended the sale under
international pressure. The dispute carried on for another eight years
with the Iranian government demanding a \$4 billion breach of contract
penalty against Russia's Rosoboronexport. And while Tehran dropped the
suit in 2015 when Rosoboronexport finally delivered the hardware,
cynicism and doubt remained.\[25\] Shortly after the signing of the 2015
Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), Moscow agreed to license the manufacture of
Russian tanks inside Iran. Russia and Iran also now hold joint military
exercises. Ironically, it was the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA), President Barack Obama's signature Iran nuclear deal,
that breathed new life into the Russia-Iran arms trade. In order to
reach agreement, Obama agreed not only to end prohibitions on Iran's
military trade but also to provide a windfall for Tehran in terms of
sanctions relief and enabling foreign investment. It was not long, for
example, before Moscow agreed to license the manufacture of Russian
tanks inside Iran.\[26\] The two countries likewise appear to be
cooperating in the cyber sphere with drones, and, despite Russian
president Vladimir Putin's denials, with satellites as well.\[27\] That
appears to be the tip of the iceberg.\[28\] Russia and Iran also
increasingly hold joint military exercises, sometimes with Chinese
participation.\[29\] The IRGC also frequently participates in Russia's
annual military games.\[30\] [Will the Russian-Iranian Alliance
Last?]{.underline} For Khamenei, hatred of the United States trumps
animosity toward Russia. In November 2015, he visited Moscow for the
first time in more than a decade, nominally to attend a summit for
gas-exporting countries. After a meeting with his Russian counterpart,
Khamenei declared, "America's long-term scheme for the region is
detrimental to all nations and countries, particularly Iran and Russia,
and it should be thwarted through vigilance and closer interaction." He
praised Putin for "neutralizing \[Washington's\] policy." Putin was also
affable. "We regard you as a trustworthy and reliable ally in the region
and the world," he told Khamenei.\[31\] Putin also looks to the future;
he was the first world leader to call Ebrahim Raisi upon his win in the
June 2021 presidential elections, a victory that many observers believe
confirm his frontrunner status to replace Khamenei upon the aging
supreme leader's death.\[32\] For Khamenei, hatred of the United States
trumps animosity toward Russia. Still, [centuries of Iranian **distrust
and hostility** do not easily dissipate]{.underline}. Perhaps this is
why, in June 2021, the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries agreed to
waive visas.\[33\] Few countries allow Iranians such access, and the
decline of the Iranian rial makes it increasingly expensive for those
that do. But a desire to bolster tourism may not be the only basis for
the agreement. There is likely hope at a more senior level that enabling
Iranians and Russians to meet and mix might breakdown the hostility that
overshadows Iranian public opinion of Russia and its aims. While the
JCPOA helped reinforce Khamenei's flailing attempt to build a
Russia-Iran strategic alliance, the drive by both Tehran and Moscow's
dictatorial regimes to cement an anti-U.S. alliance will backfire.
Decades of official Islamic Republic hostility to the United States have
not eroded and, indeed, likely may have encouraged a general
friendliness by the Iranian public toward America. [To try to push
Russia upon the public will likely accelerate that trend while Moscow's
close association with an increasingly unpopular Khamenei and Raisi will
reinforce Iranian **public hostility** toward Russia for decades to
come]{.underline}. The nature of dictatorship, however, means that in
the short term, such sentiments will not affect policy as both Tehran
and Moscow work to erode the post-World War II liberal order and U.S.
dominance on the regional and global stage.

#### Iran-Russia relations low -- nuclear deal 

Golnaz **Esfandiari 3/10**, a senior correspondent for RFE/RL focusing
on Iran. She has reported from Afghanistan and Haiti and is one of the
authors of The Farda Briefing newsletter. Her work has been cited by The
New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other major
publications, 3/10/2022, "Will Russia\'s Invasion Of Ukraine Derail The
Iran Nuclear Deal?,"
<https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-iran-nuclear-deal-demands-invasion/31746877.html>,
RES

[After nearly a year of painstaking negotiations, Iran and world powers
were on the brink of agreeing to restore the landmark 2015 nuclear deal.
But last-minute demands from Russia, one of the parties to the deal,
have threatened to derail efforts to revive an agreement that curbed
Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international
sanctions. Moscow has demanded guarantees from Washington that Western
sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine will not affect its trade and
military cooperation with Tehran. The United States has described
Russia\'s new demands as \"irrelevant.\"]{.underline} France, another
signatory of the original deal, warned they could dash hopes for a
revived nuclear accord. [Moscow' actions have been met with **surprise
and anger in Tehran**. Iran's foreign minister told lawmakers on March
7, without naming Russia, that Tehran would not let its interests be
undermined by "foreign elements." Experts warn that Russia's demands
could complicate and ultimately **scuttle** the already fraught
negotiations between Iran and world powers. If the talks collapse, Iran
could further advance its sensitive nuclear activities. It could also
lead to Western countries further tightening **sanctions against
Tehran**. Observers say Iran and world powers could **sideline Russia
from the negotiations**, although it is unclear whether Tehran would be
willing to risk jeopardizing its relationship with Moscow, an
ally.]{.underline} Iran and world powers have been holding negotiations
in Vienna since April 2021, with the United States taking part
indirectly. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew
Washington from the deal. Tehran responded by gradually exceeding the
limits imposed by the pact on its nuclear activities. U.S. President Joe
Biden has said he is willing to rejoin the pact if Iran return to full
compliance. \'Stabbed In The Back\' Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group, says that by inserting [the
war in Ukraine into the complicated nuclear negotiations, Russia appears
to be determined to upend the talks and take Iran down with
it.]{.underline} He suggested that [Russia appears no longer to be
interested in reviving the nuclear deal, which would allay Western
concerns over Iran's nuclear activities and allow Tehran to sell its
oil. And that could bring global oil prices down.]{.underline} "Neither
Iran\'s return to the oil market nor the peaceful resolution of a
Western security concern in the Middle East benefits the Kremlin," Vaez
told RFE/RL. "The leadership in Tehran is waking up to the reality that
you often get stabbed in the back by those you believed to have your
back." \'Tank The Talks\' Analysts say the scope of Russia's demands
will determine whether they complicate or scuttle the negotiations
entirely. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 5 said that
Moscow wanted written guarantees that sanctions ''launched by the U.S.
will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and
economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation
with Iran." Russia's new demands coincided with mounting international
pressure on Moscow over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February
24, a move that has resulted in unprecedented Western sanctions. U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed Russia's demands on March 6,
saying U.S. sanctions that are "being put in place and that have been
put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal."
"If it is simply exemptions that allow Russia to help Iran meet its
nuclear obligations in the deal, that is one thing," Eric Brewer, a
senior director at Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a Washington-based
think tank, told RFE/RL. "But Lavrov\'s comments suggest Russia is after
something much bigger. [I don\'t see the United States giving Russia
that type of sanctions relief, even if it endangers a revival of the
\[nuclear deal\],"]{.underline} he added. Brewer says the United States
and Russia have been able to cooperate on shared nonproliferation
interests in the past, even when tensions have been high. But he says it
is possible that Russia's recent demands \"tank the talks.\" \'Critical
Decision\' Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle
East studies at Johns Hopkins University, says [Russia's demands have
forced Iran to make a difficult choice: to stick by Russia and incur the
**diplomatic and economic costs** of the talks collapsing or to ditch
Moscow and endanger its ties with an ally.]{.underline} "Iran would have
to decide how important an agreement is to its national interest, and
whether it will allow talks it has invested so much in and built its
economic and foreign policies around \[to\] be taken hostage by Russia,"
Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to the Obama administration, told
RFE/RL. "[It will be a critical decision for Tehran]{.underline}." [Nasr
suggested that **sidelining Russia was possible**.]{.underline} "[The
nuclear side of things is in Iran's hand. The sanctions are in the hands
of the U.S. and Europe. Russia\'s only leverage is to prevent a
deal]{.underline}," Nasr said. Brewer says the other parties to the deal
would have to find ways to replace Russia's technical role under the
deal, including removing excess enriched uranium from Iran. "Given
enough time, you could probably come up with some workarounds for other
parties to take Russia\'s place on these technical areas," he says.
\"But it won\'t be easy, and time is in short supply. \"[At a practical
level, it would be incredibly challenging to reimplement the deal if
Russia, the United States, and Europe are not in alignment on the
\[nuclear deal\] and if Russia is actively trying to play the role of
**spoiler**]{.underline}."

### 2AC -- Ukraine Thumper

#### Russia is moving [away from]{.underline} Syria to [Ukraine]{.underline} now\-\--the impact is [inevitable]{.underline}. 

Dr. Hamdan **Al-Shehri 6/4**, a political analyst and international
relations scholar, 6/4/2022, "Russia's Syria withdrawal a boon for
Iran's regional project," <https://www.arabnews.com/node/2096641>, RES

The [echoes of the Russian-Ukrainian war]{.underline}, which is less
than four months old, have [reached our region]{.underline}. Our talk is
not about units or militias affiliated with Tehran joining the fight
there. Rather, [we are talking about geopolitics, as well as the void we
have begun to notice as a result of the **gradual military retreat** and
withdrawal of Russia from Syria, with the Iranian presence filling this
void.]{.underline} [Russia moved into the region in the shadow of the
American withdrawal as it sought to achieve its interests. This led to
Moscow improving its trade and investment balance, besides using the
port of Tartus and playing an important role in the Middle East.
Russia's military presence in Syria --- to support the Damascus regime
--- was considered a **counterbalance and check on Iran**, even though
it is an ally of the Iranians there]{.underline}. Its presence has also
become a reason for the regional acceptance of the spread of Iran's
militias in Syria. However, the theory of the foreign balance inside
Syria is on the verge of disruption. [In recent weeks, there have been
reports of Russian troops leaving, possibly to the front line in
Ukraine. We will **likely** see further Russian **withdrawals**,
creating more space for the Iranians.]{.underline} [The Russian
withdrawal from Syria could end up as a repeat of America's withdrawal
from Iraq.]{.underline} [This might mean the Iraqi scenario --- with its
**sectarian war**, demographic changes, **armed terrorist militias**,
killings and displacement --- is replicated in Syria.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine war destroys Russia and Iran relations

Emil **Avdaliani,** 5-13-20**22**, \"Iran Gives Russia Two and a Half
Cheers,\" CEPA,
https://cepa.org/iran-gives-russia-two-and-a-half-cheers/

[For Iran, the **invasion of Ukraine** is closely related to the very
essence of the present world order. Much like Russia, Iran has been
voicing its discontent at the way the international system has operated
since the end of the Cold War. More broadly, **Iran and Russia** see the
world through strikingly similar lenses. Both keenly anticipate the end
of the multipolar world and the end of the West's geopolitical
preponderance. Iran had its reasons to think this way. The **US
unipolar** moment after 1991 provoked a deep fear **of imminent
encirclement**, with American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq cited as
evidence. Like Russia, the Islamic Republic views itself as a separate
civilization that needs to be not only acknowledged by outside
players,]{.underline} but also to be given ana suitable geopolitical
space to project influence[. Both Russia and Iran are very clear about
their respective spheres of influence. For Russia, it is the territories
that once constituted the Soviet empire. For Iran, it is the contiguous
states reaching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean --- Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon --- plus Yemen.]{.underline} When the two former imperial
powers have overlapping strategic interests such as, for instance, in
the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, they apply the concept of
regionalism. This implies the blocking out of non-regional powers from
exercising outsize economic and military influence, and mostly revolves
around an order dominated by the powers which border on a region. [This
largely explains why Iran sees the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an
opportunity that, if successful, could hasten **the end** of the
**liberal** world order. This is why it has largely toed the Russian
line and explained what it describes as legitimate motives behind the
invasion]{.underline}. Thus the expansion of NATO into eastern Europe
was cited as having provoked Russian moves[. "The root of the
crisis]{.underline} in Ukraine [is the US policies that create the
crisis, and Ukraine is one victim of these policies,"
[argued](https://english.khamenei.ir/news/8879/Iran-supports-ending-the-war-in-Ukraine-US-root-of-Ukraine-crisis)
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei슩ollowing the invasion. To a
certain degree, Iran's approach to Ukraine has been also influenced by
mishaps in b]{.underline}ilateral relations which largely began with the
accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet by Iranian
surface-to-air missiles in January 2020, [killing 176
people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51073621). The
regime first denied responsibility, and later blamed human error. Iran,
like several other of Russia's [friends and
defenders](https://www.mediaite.com/uncategorized/these-are-the-24-countries-that-voted-no-to-suspending-russia-from-the-un-human-rights-council/)[,
the ideal scenario would have been a quick war in which the Kremlin
achieved its major goals**. Protracted war, however, sends a bad
signal**. It signals that the liberal order was not in such steep
decline after all, and that Russia's [calls for a new
era](http://www.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770) in international relations
have been far from realistic. The unsuccessful war also shows Iran that
the collective West still has very significant power and --- despite
well-aired differences --- an ability to rapidly coalesce to defend the
existing rules-based order. Worse, for these countries, the sanctions
imposed on Russia go further; demonstrating the West's ability to make
significant economic sacrifices to make its anger felt. In other words,
Russia's failure in Ukraine actually strengthened the West and made it
more united than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks
on the US. A reinvigorated liberal order is the last thing that Iran
wants, given its own troubled relations with the collective
West.]{.underline} The continuing negotiations on a [revived nuclear
deal](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/eus-borrell-says-coordinator-trip-075454031.html)
will be heavily impacted by how Russia's war proceeds, and how the US
and EU continue to respond to the aggression. Iran fears that a defeated
Russia might be so angered as to use its critical position to endanger
the talks, vital to the lifting of the West's crippling sanctions. And
despite rhetorical [support for Russia, Iran has been careful not
to]{.underline} **[overestimate]{.underline}** Russia's power. It is now
far from clear that the Kremlin has achieved its long-term goal of
"safeguarding" its western frontier. Indeed, the Putin regime may have
done the opposite now that it has driven Finland and Sweden into the
NATO fold. Western sanctions on Russia are likely to remain for a long
time, threatening long-term Russian economic (and possible regime)
stability. Moreover, Russia's fostering of separatist entities
(following the recognition of the so called Luhansk and Donetsk
"people's republics" and other breakaway entities in Georgia and
Moldova) is a highly polarizing subject in Iran. True there has been a
shift toward embracing Russia's position over Ukraine, but Iran remains
deeply committed to the "Westphalian principles" of non-intervention in
the affairs of other states and territorial integrity. This is hardly
surprising given its own struggles against potential separatism in the
peripheries of the country. Many Iranians also sympathize with Ukraine's
plight, which for some evokes Iran's defeats in the early 19th century
wars when Qajars had to cede the eastern part of the South Caucasus to
Russia. This forms part of a historically deeply rooted,
anti-imperialist sentiment in Iran. Iran is therefore likely to largely
abstain from endorsing Russia's separatist ambitions in Eastern Ukraine.
It will also eschew, where possible, support for Russia in international
forums. Emblematic of this policy was the March 2 meeting in the United
Nations General Assembly when Iran, rather than siding with Russia,
abstained from the vote which condemned the invasion. Russia's poor
military performance, and the West's ability to act unanimously, serve
as a warning for the Islamic Republic that it may one day have to soak
up even more Western pressure if Europe, the US, and other democracies
act in union. In the meantime, [like
China](https://chinaobservers.eu/china-struggles-to-strike-a-balance-amid-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/),
Iran will hope to benefit from the magnetic pull of the Ukraine war.
With so much governmental, military and diplomatic attention demanded by
the conflict, it will for the time being serve as a distraction from
Iran's ambitions elsewhere.

#### Ukraine thumps

Mark N. **Katz**, 3-23-20**15**, \"Russian-Iranian Relations in the
Shadow of Ukraine,\" Wilson Center,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/russian-iranian-relations-the-shadow-ukraine

On March 23, 2015, the Middle East Program and the Kennan Institute at
the Woodrow Wilson Center hosted an event, "Russian-Iranian Relations in
the Shadow of Ukraine" with Katz, also a former scholar of the Woodrow
Wilson Center. Haleh Esfandiari, Director of the Middle East Program,
Woodrow Wilson Center, moderated the event. Katz began by stating that
the character of Russian-Iranian relations is much different since the
election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani than it was in the past. He
[noted the tension between the United States and Russia has increased
because of the escalating crisis between Russia and Ukraine. However, he
emphasized that for the first time since the 1979 Iranian Revolution
there is hope for an improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations. It is not
likely that U.S.-Russian relations **will improve** in the coming years,
however. Katz then explained how the nuclear negotiations are playing a
large role in the three countries' relations with one
another.]{.underline} He said Russia would not interfere in the nuclear
talks because it is not in a position to stop them but argued that
Russia would not benefit from improved U.S.-Iranian relations because
sanctions against Iran would be lifted with a deal, allowing for Iranian
oil imports. Furthermore, Katz stated that despite the illusion of a
stronger alliance created by the visits of Russian officials to Iran and
vice-versa, there is still a significant amount of history between the
two countries. For example, the division of the Caspian Sea is still an
unresolved conflict between Russia and Iran, and Iran remains resentful
of Russia for Soviet support of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War.
Katz emphasized that while [the media may portray U.S.-Iranian relations
**as straine**d, Russian-Iranian relations **are much more
hostile.**]{.underline} Katz argued that despite the differences Russia
and Iran may have, they share the same view on multiple issues. He
stated that both countries are fearful of the Taliban regaining control
and influence in Afghanistan. In addition, both countries support Bashar
al-Assad's regime in Syria and provide military assistance to Assad.
Russia and Iran also both have a common interest in joining the fight
against ISIS, which poses a threat to both countries' national security.
Regarding a potential nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1, Katz
stated that Russia is very conflicted---Russia does not see Iran
acquiring nuclear power as the worst case scenario but is concerned
about an improvement in U.S.-Iran relations. Although Russia is not in a
position to block the nuclear deal, it hopes it will benefit from the
failure to secure a deal. On the topic of Russia-Iran relations with
regard to the Ukrainian conflict, Katz argued that Iran is not concerned
with the issue and has kept its distance from the matter. [Katz stated
that Iran would benefit from the crisis because it gives the country
**more leverage with the** West, considering that the West will want to
reduce their dependence on Russian]{.underline} gas and would be more
likely to turn to Iran for support. In response to a question from Jane
Harman, President of the Wilson Center, on whether Russia will benefit
from taking Iran's reprocessed fuel if the negotiations succeed, Katz
said that Russia would benefit greatly from this because it would
produce a profit, but whether or not this will put Russia in the good
graces of the West is questionable because of the escalation and
severity of the Ukraine crisis. Esfandiari asked what effect Russia's
rush to sign agreements on additional nuclear power plants with Iran
will have on the talks. Katz answered that Russia views the negotiations
as an opportunity for the United States to gain commercial profit rather
than a national security issue. Therefore, Russia is attempting to sign
as many agreements as possible with Iran before the United States has an
opportunity to lift the sanctions.

<https://www.newsweek.com/nato-grows-china-russia-seek-bring-iran-saudi-arabia-fold-1720780>)

[Finland and Sweden\'s green light to join NATO is set to bring about
the U.S.-led Western military alliance\'s largest expansion in
decades.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the G7, consisting of NATO states and
fellow U.S. ally Japan, has adopted a tougher line against Russia and
China. [In the East, however, security and economy-focused blocs led by
Beijing and Moscow are looking to take on new members of their own,
including Iran and Saudi Arabia, two influential Middle Eastern rivals
whose interest in shoring up cooperation on this new front could have a
significant impact on global geopolitical balance.]{.underline} The two
bodies in question are the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and
BRICS. The former was established in 2001 as a six-member political,
economic and military coalition including China, Russia and the Central
Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before recruiting
South Asian nemeses India and Pakistan in 2017, while the latter is a
grouping of emerging economic powers originally consisting of Brazil,
Russia, India and China (BRIC) upon its inception 2006, and including
South Africa in 2010. \"[The BRICS and the SCO share one important
ideological quality: they are both focused on multipolarity, and their
summits have even been held back to back with one another at
times]{.underline},\" Matthew Neapole, an international affairs expert
and contributor to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Canada, told
Newsweek. \"Both are angling to act as force multipliers for this drive
for multipolarity, to help along with alternatives \[i.e, in currency or
banking\],\" he added. \"It could, in theory, facilitate economic
linkages and step into gaps that U.S. institutions are not filling due
to sanctions, such as those laid on Russia.\" Iran, already an SCO
observer, began its formal membership ascension process amid the latest
leaders\' summit in September. On Monday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry
announced the Islamic Republic would also seek to join BRICS. [Across
the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia has also reportedly considered applying
for BRICS membership, as revealed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov during his visit to the kingdom in late May]{.underline}. The
announcement followed Saudi Arabia joining Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Senegal, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates at
China\'s invitation for a \"BRICS+\" discussion, after which Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced members had
\"reached consensus on the BRICS expansion process.\" Of these
candidates, Argentina has already applied for membership, potentially
advancing the group\'s status toward being a major player in
international economic relations. And with the SCO seeking to grow as
well, Beijing and Moscow might be poised to advance their effort to sway
the international influence equilibrium toward a broader group of
countries that do not necessarily sign on to an explicitly U.S.-led
international order. And while Neapole argued that there would be \"big
hurdles to get over\" in trying to transform this vision from ambitious
talk to substantive action, he said a cohesive SCO-BRICS bloc could have
a huge impact on reshaping the world order. [\"If it can be successful
in positioning itself as the standard-bearer of the Global South or G20,
develop strong organizational mechanisms and integrate more
thoroughly,\" he said, \"it could be quite influential.\"]{.underline}
BRICS\' multipolar approach to international affairs has proven
attractive to both Iran and Saudi Arabia alike. The two nations,
however, have their own unique reasons for seeking membership. For
Riyadh, the move would likely be less about choosing sides against the
close ties it has fostered for decades with Washington and more about
the kingdom\'s own growing status as an independent player. \"China\'s
invitation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to join the \'BRICS\' confirms
that the Kingdom has a major role in building the new world and became
an important and essential player in global trade and economics,\"
Mohammed al-Hamed, president of the Saudi Elite group in Riyadh, told
Newsweek. \"Saudi Arabia\'s Vision 2030 is moving forward at a confident
and global pace in all fields and sectors.\" This vision, unveiled by
Prince Mohammed bin Salman a year before being appointed as heir to the
throne and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia in 2017, outlined a plan to
diversify his country\'s oil-dependent economy and present a new image
of the kingdom to the international community. [And while Crown Prince
Mohammed has sought to enhance cooperation with the U.S., especially as
President Joe Biden prepared this month for his first visit to the
monarchy he once branded a \"pariah\" over alleged human rights abuses,
the Saudi royal has also expanded ties with Russia and China in recent
years.]{.underline} Joining BRICS would demonstrate a commitment to
Riyadh\'s resolve in dealing with other major powers and mark a
significant win for the effort to boost economic frameworks established
outside of the auspices of the U.S. and its immediate allies. \"This
accession, if Saudi joins it, will balance the world economic system,
especially since the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of
oil in the world, and it\'s in the G20,\" Hamed said. \"If it happens,
this will support any economic movement and development in the world
trade and economy, and record remarkable progress in social and economic
aspects as Saudi Arabia should have partnerships with every country in
the world.\" [This approach came in stark contrast to that of
Washington, which has regularly shut out countries it disagreed with
through a growing list of sanctions. The U.S.\' dominant position in the
global financial system has traditionally left few options for these
nations, but that situation has gradually changed as frameworks like
BRICS offer potential ways to dodge these restrictions]{.underline}.
[Among those countries looking to counter U.S. economic pressure is
Iran. International sanctions against the Islamic Republic in response
to its nuclear activities were lifted in 2015 after a multilateral
nuclear deal was reached with the U.S. and other major powers, including
China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom, but
then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, severely
impacting Tehran\'s ability to trade with the international
community]{.underline}. Biden has set out to negotiate a potential
return to the accord that was reached during his vice presidency under
former President Barack Obama. However, a series of negotiations held
since April of last year has left the U.S. and Iran at an impasse and
another set of talks held in Qatar this week appeared to end early with
no sign of a breakthrough. Frustration over shifting politics in
Washington has led Tehran to increasingly look to its own region for
strategic partnerships, which it has increasingly forged with Beijing
and Moscow. [\"Iranian officials have come to the conclusion that the
U.S. and its Western allies will never allow the Islamic Republic of
Iran to play its well-deserved regional role as a middle power,\"
Zakiyeh Yazdanshenas, a research fellow at the Center for Middle East
Strategic Studies in Tehran, told Newsweek.]{.underline} \"Therefore,
they have decided to neutralize U.S. attempts to isolate Iran by further
closing to non-western bodies like SCO and BRICS,\" she added. \"In
addition, [Iranians consider the future world order to be Eastern and
they are trying to get closer to organizations in which Eastern powers
such as Russia and China play a significant role.\"]{.underline} This
doesn\'t mean that the two blocs are necessary anti-Western in nature.
Though a concerted effort has emerged to empower countries outside of
the traditional G7 grouping from which Russia was suspended in 2014 as
conflict first erupted over Ukraine and other major economies such as
China and India have not been invited, the SCO and BRICS, which are not
formal military alliances like NATO, saw themselves as inherently
inclusive. \"The SCO and the BRICS have not been established as an
alternative to Western organizations,\" Yazdanshenas said, \"and their
specific function has not been defined on the basis of confrontation
with the West or the existing world order.\" Still, she argued that
growing international competition has only intensified \"the balancing
function of non-Western organizations\" such as the SCO and BRICS. And
here, she said Iran could serve as an important asset for both
coalitions. [\"Joining a moderate power with an anti-Western approach
such as Iran to these bodies can strengthen this aspect of SCO and
BRICS,\" Yazdanshenas said. \"Iran has been under the most severe
sanctions in the last decade, yet it has been able to significantly
expand its power in the region.\"]{.underline} And, like Saudi Arabia,
[Iran\'s oil and gas reserves make it an important strategic partner,
especially given the worsening frictions over global energy that have
been exacerbated by Western sanctions on Russia, and heated rivalry
between Beijing and Washington.]{.underline} \"[Iran is the only
producer of energy resources in the Persian Gulf that is not an ally of
the United States and will not refuse to supply energy to China in the
event of an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and
Washington]{.underline},\" Yazdanshenas said. \"In addition, [Iran\'s
geopolitical position has been strengthened in the wake of
Russia-Ukraine war and that is of great importance for great powers in
these bodies i.e. Russia and China.\"]{.underline} The energy problem
plays into two key reasons having both Iran and Saudi Arabia on board
for BRICS would be a \"major gain\" for the organization, according to
Akhil Ramesh, a fellow at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum. \"For
countries like China and to an extent India, import dependency for oil
has been a major headache, both from an economic standpoint of trade
deficits and from a geopolitical standpoint of having to make security
and strategic sacrifices for the sake of oil imports,\" Ramesh said.
\"Having three large oil producers in the grouping \[Russia, Iran and
Saudi Arabia\] could possibly give these countries the option of
securing oil at discounted rates or through alternative arrangements
\[barter\].\" Tehran and Riyadh\'s oil reserves would also lend BRICS a
stronger hand in taking on the U.S. dollar\'s hegemony over the world
financial system as Ramesh argued that, \"in order to replace the USD as
the global reserve currency you would need to have more
commodity-exporting countries, especially oil exporting ones buying into
the idea.\" \"Moreover,\" he added, \"[China and Russia are expanding
the grouping to create a coalition of countries that have pending
disputes with the West or have been humiliated by the West in the past
\[thinking Argentina and Falklands\].\"]{.underline} And in this
respect, Ramesh expressed that the U.S. and its allies had committed \"a
grave error\" in overlooking the importance of BRICS, as well as the
SCO, emerging financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the National Development Bank and China\'s broader
Belt and Road Initiative, which counts some 148 countries and 32
international organizations as partners. \"The U.S. and its allies are
grossly underestimating China, in particular,\" Ramesh said. \"BRICS,
SCO, development banks such as AIIB, NDB, and infrastructure initiatives
such as China\'s BRI are all different platforms for engaging mostly
poor countries that do not get a say in world affairs or have a seat at
the high table.\" As internal divisions have threatened to derail
NATO\'s agenda, feuds among members also serve as a complicating factor
for organizations led by China and Russia. And even if Iran and Saudi
Arabia were to both join BRICS, it would not necessarily prove a
breakthrough in their bitter rivalry. The two nations have pursued quiet
diplomacy over the past year, but their regional bout for influence has
continued to rage across the Middle East, most violently so in Yemen,
which has been devastated by a years-long war between a Saudi-led
coalition in support of an exiled government on one side and the
Iran-aligned Ansar Allah, or Houthi, rebels on the other. The conflict
has only quieted in recent months as a result of a fragile three-month
truce and not necessarily because of any lasting solution. [But China
and Russia have demonstrated a capacity to bring enemies together under
a common banner as seen with the SCO\'s simultaneous admission of India
and Pakistan five years ago.]{.underline} Yaroslav Lissovolik, a
Moscow-based Russian International Affairs Council expert and Valdai
Discussion Club program director, said BRICS too has the capacity to
host countries with clashing worldviews, mentioning the specific case of
China and India, whose rivalry has turned occasionally turned violent,
and even deadly, along their disputed Himalayan border. And while he
said that the \"expansion of the BRICS core membership may indeed result
in greater challenges in attaining consensus on key decisions going
forward,\" he felt there was ample room to work together on broader
questions. \"In this respect, the addition of Iran and Saudi Arabia
would not change matters fundamentally within BRICS as there is scope
for a divergence in views,\" Lissovolik told Newsweek, \"and while there
may be disagreement on particular local/regional problems, there may be
greater unity on global issues.\" He argued that disputes among members
have not stopped BRICS from managing \"to advance with an increasingly
ambitious development agenda, including with respect to launching the
BRICS+ initiative and the pragmatic cooperation within the BRICS
development institutions.\" \"What this means is that the BRICS offer
the possibility of development on the basis of divergence in economic
models and approaches to economic modernization rather than convergence
towards one particular universal model,\" Lissovolik said. \"While
allowing for the differences in views and approaches among their
members,\" he added, \"BRICS economies can move decisively forward in
tackling those global challenges where they manage to forge a
consensus.\"

#### Russia and Iran are only brought together because of NATO and the US' expansion

**Tasnim News Agency**, 5-17-20**22**, \"Iranian Spokesman Blames
Ukraine Crisis on NATO's Expansion,\"
https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2022/05/17/2712467/iranian-spokesman-blames-ukraine-crisis-on-nato-s-expansion

[Iran\'s envoy to Russia has said NATO\'s expansion **is not** in the
interest **of Tehran and Moscow**, and there is a global synergy against
Western "unilateralism." The comments came as Iran has supported
Russia's invasion of Ukraine by **blaming** the United States **and
NATO** for the ensuing crisis. During a webinar about bilateral
relations and regional developments, Kazem Jalali urged closer
cooperation with Moscow under President Vladimir Putin, saying, "We are
working with Russia on regional issues, and have a successful experience
in Syria's case", Jamaran News in Tehran reported on Monday.
\"Obviously, neither we nor the Russians see NATO expanding to our
borders in our interest,\" said Tehran's ambassador in Moscow. Turkey, a
NATO member borders Iran in the northwest but has followed a neutral
policy between the Washington and Tehran. Jalali added that Russia has
stood up to American unilateralism, noting that this is the same
approach that the Islamic Republic has taken since the 1979 revolution.
Jalali noted that Iran did not have good relations with the Tsarist
Russia, the Soviet Union, and in the post-Soviet period,
adding]{.underline}, "The fourth era is the Putin era, which I think
should be paid more attention to". Judging by the history of Iran-Russia
relations, "some people ask why we should have relations with the
Russians when we have such a history with them. We should know that
during the Soviet era 25 million people were killed in the war with
Germany" but that didn't stop them to cooperate on the Nord Stream
\--the system of offshore natural gas pipelines in Europe that runs
under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. He added that "we should
look at the realities of today", underlining that Iran's new government
prioritizes relations and strengthening cooperation with neighboring
countries, and "Russia is a large economy." Jalali went on to say that
"our foreign policy should serve Iran's national interests", urging to
keep a balance between the West and the East. In fact, in the past 30
years under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Iran's foreign policy has
increasingly tilted toward Russia and China. In the 1980s, when the
founder of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was Supreme
Leader, the country followed his dictum of "Neither West Nor the East."
During the same event, former member of the parliament Elaheh Koulai
described ties between Iran and Russia as one of **[the most
importan]{.underline}**t issues in Eurasia. "There are bitter events in
the history of Iran-Russia relations that have caused pessimism and
Russophobia in Iranian society" she added. She called for a balancing
approach with Russia, Europe and the United States, saying, "we must try
to use Russia to our advantage". Referring to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, Koulai said, "Iran must condemn Russia\'s military action
against Ukraine and demand that the two sides sit down at the
negotiating table". As debate about Russia's invasion of Ukraine
continues in Iran, [divisions reflect the political
dispositions](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202202274930) of various
factions over Tehran's foreign policy. Hardliners close to the core of
the regime fiercely defend a pro-Russia policy, while their rivals
within the regime argue for more balanced relations between the West and
the East, meaning Moscow and Beijing. Many ordinary Iranians and
opponents of the Islamic Republic invariably [support
Ukraine](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202202265209) and condemn the
government pro-Russia policies on social media.

### 2AC -- AT: Syria Impact

#### Syria war wont go nuclear, Israel destroyed their ability to use them

**Farley 22** (Robert Farley, a frequent contributor to TNI, is author
of The Battleship Book, January 26, 2022, "How Israel Prevented Syria
From Developing Nuclear Weapons",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/how-israel-prevented-syria-developing-nuclear-weapons-199923>)

On September 6, 2007, [Israeli fighter-bombers destroyed a mysterious
installation near the Euphrates River in the Deir-ez-Zor region. The
strike incurred curiously little response from Damascus. A cyber-attack
reportedly pre-empted a defensive Syrian military mobilization, and even
the diplomatic outcry was muted.]{.underline} No other Arab governments
commented on the attack, and even the Israelis did not acknowledge the
operation for quite some time. Destroying the facility was not regarded
as a slam-dunk decision, either in Israel or the United States. Anxiety
over the strength of the intelligence in the wake of the Iraq debacle
stayed the hand of the latter, while concern about international
blowback, not to mention a Syrian military response, worried the former.
What if cooler heads had carried the day, and Israel had never
undertaken the strike? Nuclear Progress It's difficult to assess how far
Syria would have been from developing a nuclear weapon if its efforts
had gone unhindered. [Although we may never have the complete story
regarding Syria's interest in a nuclear program, it probably stemmed
from the growing gap in conventional capabilities between Syria and
Israel, as well as the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Although Syria has always
denied that the installation was part of a nuclear program, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later confirmed that the site
appeared to be a nuclear reactor.]{.underline} There is little question
that Syria's program was rudimentary compared to those of Iran or North
Korea. However, it is entirely possible that Syria could have relied
upon technical assistance from both countries; indeed, it is highly
likely that North Korea supplied technical assistance for the
development of the reactor on the Euphrates. But Damascus would have
needed to master a series of technical challenges, and there is little
indication that Syrian economic infrastructure was up to the challenge
of managing the very serious industrial and bottlenecks that it would
have encountered. Although the Syrian economy is larger than that of
North Korea, it is more dependent on resource extraction, making it less
capable of managing the technical challenges associated with the nuclear
pivot. [Syria also lacks the enormous oil wealth enjoyed by both Iran
and Iraq during their nuclear drives.]{.underline} It became clear after
the destruction of the box that Assad wasn't all that committed to
paying the costs necessary to develop nuclear weapons. Unlike Iraq and
Iran, Damascus made little effort to disperse and harden nuclear
facilities. Indeed, given Syria's proximity to Israel, it's difficult to
imagine how anyone in the country believed that the project could go
undetected. As Anthony Cordesman has argued, the nuclear program would
have been extraordinarily vulnerable at multiple points in its
development. This suggests that the [bureaucratic politics of the
nuclear program were complicated, and that Syria might not have gone
through with its development even in absence of the strike.
Nevertheless, Israel felt that even the remote possibility of a nuclear
Syria was worth curtailing, and that the strikes would have the added
benefit of reinforcing the Begin Doctrine.]{.underline} The Arab Spring
In any case, [it is extremely unlikely that even an unmolested Syria
could have successfully developed a nuclear weapon by the beginning of
the Arab Spring]{.underline}. The oset of the Syrian Civil War taxed the
Assad regime so dearly that it's unlikely it would have continued a
nuclear program. Would the nature of the war have changed if Syria had
still been actively pursuing [nuclear weapons? The war developed, to
some extent, out of the expectation of Western intervention. Anti-regime
forces took risks and made commitments out of the hope that the United
States and Europe would step up with active military support. The West
offered rhetorical support for toppling Assad, but only limited and
measured military assistance for anti-regime forces.]{.underline}
Clearly, the program itself would not have deterred the West; it could
not have produced a viable weapon by 2011. However, knowledge of an
existing nuclear program might have reduced Assad's standing in the West
even further, potentially making intervention more attractive. Moreover,
the [program would presumably have achieved some degree of technical
success in terms of the production of plutonium, the development of
associated nuclear technologies, and the training of a cadre of
scientists and engineers]{.underline}. This very success might have made
the West nervous---perhaps nervous enough to take a more assertive
policy against the Assad regime. The question is what impact the war
might have had on the knowledge and infrastructure developed around the
program, and how engineers and materials might have found their way into
the hands of ISIS or other rebel groups. ISIS took control of the site
in 2014, although the Syrian government likely would have defended it
more vigorously if an active reactor had remained. ISIS [would not have
been able to construct a useable weapon, and either the United States or
Syria likely would have destroyed any facilities before they fell into
the hands of the group]{.underline}---but it still would have been cause
for concern. And while ISIS could not have used the expertise or
equipment directly, it might have tried to export either, with dangerous
consequences. In any case, forces friendly to the United States captured
the area in 2017. Conclusion The strike on Syria was probably not
decisive in preventing Syria from getting a nuclear weapon; the program
was a long-shot from the beginning, and in all likelihood would have
ended at the onset of the Syrian Civil War. However, the strike helped
to confirm the regional sense of Israeli military power after the
failures of the war against Hezbollah, and undoubtedly also convinced
both Washington and Tehran that Israel would consider using military
force to prevent Iran from acquiring nukes. This, in turn, informed the
negotiating strategies of all of the parties to the JCPOA, which
continues to govern Iran's relations with the international community.
Whether that legacy will outlast 2018 remains in question.

RES

The Issue [As tensions escalate between the United States and Iran in
the Middle East, Russia is engaged in covert and overt **cooperation**
with Iran in ways that **undermine U.S. national security
interests**.]{.underline} [This analysis of commercial satellite imagery
at Tiyas Airbase in Syria indicates the scope and proximity of Russian
and Iranian military ties. If Washington wants to contain Tehran and
prevent further Iranian expansion, U.S. policymakers will need to
**increase pressure on Moscow** to curb Tehran's activities in countries
like Syria.]{.underline} Introduction Following a June 2019 meeting with
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization summit in Kyrgyzstan, Russian President Vladimir Putin
remarked that "relations between Russia and Iran are multifaceted,
multilateral." In characterizing the primary areas of cooperation, Putin
noted: "this concerns the economy, this concerns the issues of stability
in the region, our joint efforts to combat terrorism, including in
Syria."1 One example of Russian-Iranian cooperation is in Syria. This
brief analyzes satellite imagery of Tiyas Airbase (or T-4) in Syria,
which is used by Iran and Russia. It highlights what we assess to be the
Iranian movement of weapons, other material, and personnel to Syria with
the awareness and support of Moscow. This cooperation, which has allowed
Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) to
increase their capabilities and influence in Syria, should be concerning
for the United States as tensions increase between Washington and
Tehran. Yet Moscow's cooperation with Tehran is double-edged. Our
analysis also highlights Israeli attacks against Iranian or
Iranian-linked targets at T-4 Airbase in close proximity to Russian
aircraft. These developments suggest that Moscow is playing a delicate
game in Syria. It supports Iranian activity and aid in Syria, but also
explicitly or tacitly allows Israeli military actions against Iranian
targets. The rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first
provides an overview of Russian-Iranian relations. The second section
analyzes satellite imagery of T-4 Airbase, focusing on the possible
Iranian movement of arms, other material, and personnel. The third
section highlights Israeli airstrikes in Syria, including at T-4
Airbase, in close proximity to Russian aircraft. The fourth provides a
brief conclusion. Russian-Iranian Partnership in Syria Russia and Iran
have developed a complex---and sometimes contentious---historical
relationship. During World War II, for example, the Soviet Union
occupied northern Iran, creating deep suspicion and mistrust among many
Iranians.2 Yet [Moscow and Tehran have developed a working relationship
in Syria, even though they have their own interests]{.underline}.
[Moscow's decision to become directly involved in the Syrian civil
war]{.underline}---including to work with Iran---was motivated by
several concerns. First was a [growing fear that Washington was
preparing to overthrow the Assad regime and replace it with a friendly
government, much like the United States had done in Afghanistan in 2001,
Iraq in 2003, and Libya in 2011.3 The possibility of losing Syria was
particularly alarming because Moscow had just lost its ally in
Ukraine]{.underline}. The 2014 Ukrainian revolution had ushered in a
pro- Western government in Kiev, further fueling Russian fears of U.S.
activity. Second, Syria had long been an important ally of Moscow. In
1946, the Soviet Union supported Syrian independence and provided
military assistance to the Syrian Arab Army. This cooperation continued
during the Cold War and endures under Russian President Vladimir Putin
today.4 Third, Russian leaders were concerned that Assad's collapse
would allow the Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and other terrorists to use
territory in Syria and Iraq to attract more fighters, improve their
capabilities, and spread terrorism in and around Russia. After all, over
9,000 individuals from Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia traveled
to Syria and Iraq to join Salafi-jihadist groups like the Islamic State
and al-Qaeda.5 Iran has its own interests in Syria. Following the onset
of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Iranian leaders became alarmed at the
rise of Sunni extremist groups like the Islamic State and U.S.,
European, and Gulf support to rebel groups.6 In addition to providing
light and heavy weapons to the Syrian regime and militias, up to 3,000
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) helped plan and
execute campaigns such as the 2016 Battle of Aleppo (or Operation Dawn
of Victory).7 The IRGC-QF worked closely with the Assad regime and the
Russian military, which conducted strikes from Russian combat aircraft
and naval vessels in the Mediterranean Sea.8 Syrian forces and militias
supported by the IRGC-QF shelled rebel positions in Aleppo as Russian
close air support and Kalibr cruise missile strikes reduced entire
neighborhoods to rubble. By December 2016, ground forces routed rebel
forces, who departed under an agreement brokered by Russia, Turkey, and
Iran.9 Iranian support continues today. In addition, [Iranian leaders
have tried to use their activity in Syria to counter
Israel]{.underline}. Perhaps the most significant example is by
[encouraging the expansion of Lebanese Hezbollah and other militia
groups in Syria]{.underline}. Lebanese Hezbollah deployed up to 8,000
fighters to Syria and increased its arsenal with greater numbers and
ranges of rockets and missiles from Syrian territory.10 Hezbollah also
trained, advised, and assisted Shia and other non-state groups in Syria.
Today, the IRGC-QF works with thousands of trained fighters in Syria
operating in local militias. Many of these groups like Lebanese
Hezbollah possess advanced stand-off weapons, improved cyber
capabilities, more recruits, and more expansive forces in Syria capable
of striking Israeli targets. [While Russian-Iranian cooperation has been
contentious at times, both countries have collaborated in Syria in ways
that serve their own interests.]{.underline} One example of this
cooperation is at T-4 Airbase, which is located in eastern Homs
Governorate and roughly 100 miles northeast of Damascus. T-4 Airbase and
Flight Tracker Data Figure 1 shows the base using satellite imagery. On
the east side of the base is an apron (ramp) where aircraft,
helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently parked.
On the west side is an apron where transport aircraft have been located
and where Israeli aircraft have struck targets. Figure 1: T-4 Airbase
Satellite imagery in Figure 2 highlights a Russian-made Ilyushin
Il-76-MD cargo aircraft on the base. This aircraft is likely the former
Russian Airforce Il-76 registered RA-76634, as indicated by the number
painted underneath the cockpit and livery of the aircraft.11 The imagery
shows the freighter being loaded or unloaded under the protection of
multiple Syrian air defense systems, including three SA-2 systems and a
Pantsir-S1--- all of which were provided by Russia.12 We assess that the
Il-76 and other commercial aircraft may have been used to transport
weapons, other material, or personnel from Iran into Syria, based on the
regular use of Il-76s for these purposes in Syria.13 Figure 2: Il-76 on
T-4 Runway Flight tracker data of the Il-76 aircraft indicates a recent
history of flights between Tehran and Damascus. As indicated on the
wing, the plane is registered as YK-ATD. The Prefix (YK) is the Syrian
country code. Other Syrian-owned Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft have similar
registry codes, such as YK-ATA, YK-ATB, and YK-ATC. Publicly available
flight tracker data indicates the YK-ATD makes regular flights between
Tehran and Damascus. As illustrated in Figure 3, on May 13, 2019, YK-ATD
departed Damascus International Airport. On May 14, 2019, the day we
observed YK-ATD at T-4 Airbase, flight records indicate the plane left
Tehran Mehrabad International Airport in the morning, arrived at what we
assess to be T-4 based on imagery analysis, and then departed for
Damascus International Airport in the afternoon. Our analysis of flight
history for other Syrian-owned Il-76 aircraft indicates similar flight
patterns between Iran and Syria for other aircraft, possibly for the
purpose of clandestinely transferring weapons, other material, and
personnel into Syria.14 Figure 3: Flight Data Tracker Map for YK-ATD As
shown in Figure 4, we identified four Russian fixed-wing Su-25 ground
attack aircraft with full weapons loads at the same site as the Il-76
aircraft, as well as an Mi-17 Hip transport helicopter and an Mi-24 Hind
attack helicopter.15 The proximity of Russian aircraft to the Il-76
suggests that Russia was highly likely aware of Iranian activity. It is
virtually inconceivable that Iran would transport and unload arms, other
material, and personnel to a base frequented by Russian aircraft and
government officials---and protected by Russian-made air defense
systems--- without Moscow's knowledge and approval. Figure 4: Russian
Su-25, Mi-24, and Mi-17 Aircraft on Runway The imagery also indicates
three active air defense sites around the perimeter of T-4 Airbase.
Figure 5 highlights one of these sites. All of the air defense sites are
equipped with Russian-made weapons systems. The first SA-2 air defense
site is situated to the north, another SA-2 air defense site is located
to the northwest, and a third SA-2 air defense site is to the south. The
SA-2 Guideline (Russian designation S-75 Dvina) is a high-altitude,
command guided, surface-to-air missile system (SAM) capable of
360-degree coverage. The SA-2 Guideline is designed for the defense of
fixed targets and field forces.16 The guidance system of an SA-2 site
can only focus on one target at a time but can direct three missiles
against a target simultaneously.17 This likely explains the need for
multiple SA-2 systems around the airbase. Figure 5: SA-2 Air Defense
System Also observable in the imagery is a Pantsir-S1 (NATO name---SA-22
Greyhound) transloader. The Panstsir-S1 is a short- to medium-range
missile and anti-aircraft artillery weapon produced by Russia. The
Pantsir-S1 provides point air defense for various installations and
provides protection to air defense units. Figure 6 illustrates the
Pantsir-S1 air defense system. Figure 6: S-1 Pantsir Air Defense System
All military assets in the imagery are Russian made. We assess that the
YK-ATD was likely either leased or sold to Syria.18 The Su-25 combat
aircraft, as well as the Mi-17 and Mi-24 rotary-wing craft, are likely
Russian operated.19 The SA-2 Guideline and Pantsir-S1 are Russian-built
SAM systems.20These air defense systems are just two of numerous air
defense systems provided by Russia to the Assad government. Others
include S-75s, S-200s, S-300s, and Strela-1/-10s.21 With Russian
support, Iran has used these types of activities to expand its presence
in Syria. Today, the IRGC-QF works with thousands of trained fighters in
Syria who are operating in local militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah.
The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War demonstrated Israel's difficulty of
rooting out Hezbollah sites in Lebanon. Iran's activity in Syria has
only expanded the nature of this problem for Israel's military. Israeli
Airstrikes in the Shadow of the Bear Despite Russia's collaboration with
Iran, Moscow has also attempted to placate Israeli concerns about
Iranian expansion. This section highlights Israeli attacks against
Iranian or Iranian-linked targets---including at T-4 Airbase in close
proximity to Russian aircraft. These developments suggest that Moscow
supports Iranian activity and aid in Syria, but also condones some
Israeli military actions against Iranian targets. Russia and Israel have
established deconfliction mechanisms, including a hotline between the
Israeli and Russian militaries. As one Israel Defense Force official
remarked, "We are very strict about informing the Russians about our
activities and that their operational picture is up to date."22 This
cooperation is particularly important to avoid incidents like the one in
September 2018. Following an Israeli strike against Iranian-linked
targets in western Syria, Syrian gunners accidentally shot down a
Russian IL-20 surveillance aircraft. Russia complained that Israel had
given Russian leaders less than a minute of advanced warning and Israeli
aircraft used "the Russian airplane as a cover."23 Despite some
improvements in cooperation, Russia has occasionally condemned Israel
for its actions in Syria. In July 2019, for example, Russia publicly
criticized a series of Israeli strikes, saying that that they "grossly
violate\[d\] Syria's sovereignty.24 Figure 7 plots the location of
Israeli airstrikes against Iranian and other targets in Syria. The
darker shades of blue in the heat map indicate a higher concentration of
Israeli strikes. Most of Israel's attacks have been in southwestern
Syria, near the Israeli border. But a few attacks have been against
major bases used by Iran and Iranian-linked groups, including T-4
Airbase, the airbase north of al-Qusayr, and Damascus International
Airport. Figure 7: Israeli Strikes in Syria On June 2, 2019, Israel
conducted an airstrike on T-4 Airbase.25 This strike, along with similar
strikes conducted in 2019, indicate that Israel is still committed to
contesting attempts by Iran to entrench itself and its non-state partner
forces in Syria. As highlighted in Figure 8, satellite imagery taken
before and after the Israeli airstrike indicates that a UAV control
vehicle, launch ramp, and ground equipment were likely targeted. This
airstrike, which was conducted in close proximity to Russian
infrastructure on the base, highlights the ongoing challenge Israel
faces when conducting strikes near Russian forces. Figure 8: Before and
After Imagery of Israeli Strike Against Iranian-Linked Target at T-4
Conclusion The Trump administration has expressed [significant **concern
about Iran's nuclear ambitions**, its missile program, and the
activities of the IRGC-QF and its partner forces in the Middle East. One
of the countries where Iran has been most active is **Syria**, where
Tehran has increased its military presence to aid the Assad regime;
supported Lebanese Hezbollah, which has been directly involved in the
**Syrian ground war**; and expanded the number of rockets and missiles
in the country to establish a second front (along with Lebanon) in a
future war with Israel. Yet Iranian actions in Syria have been possible,
in part, because of Tehran's **cooperation with Moscow**. Containing
Iran and preventing further Iranian expansion in the Middle East will be
difficult without **increasing pressure on Moscow**.]{.underline} If
Washington wants to be more effective in containing Iran, U.S.
policymakers need to put greater pressure on Moscow to curb Tehran's
movement of arms, material, and people--- as this case study of T-4
Airbase highlights.

RES

[After nearly a year of painstaking negotiations, Iran and world powers
were on the brink of agreeing to restore the landmark 2015 nuclear deal.
But last-minute demands from Russia, one of the parties to the deal,
have threatened to derail efforts to revive an agreement that curbed
Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international
sanctions. Moscow has demanded guarantees from Washington that Western
sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine will not affect its trade and
military cooperation with Tehran. The United States has described
Russia\'s new demands as \"irrelevant.\"]{.underline} France, another
signatory of the original deal, warned they could dash hopes for a
revived nuclear accord. [Moscow' actions have been met with **surprise
and anger in Tehran**. Iran's foreign minister told lawmakers on March
7, without naming Russia, that Tehran would not let its interests be
undermined by "foreign elements." Experts warn that Russia's demands
could complicate and ultimately **scuttle** the already fraught
negotiations between Iran and world powers. If the talks collapse, Iran
could further advance its sensitive nuclear activities. It could also
lead to Western countries further tightening **sanctions against
Tehran**. Observers say Iran and world powers could **sideline Russia
from the negotiations**, although it is unclear whether Tehran would be
willing to risk jeopardizing its relationship with Moscow, an
ally.]{.underline} Iran and world powers have been holding negotiations
in Vienna since April 2021, with the United States taking part
indirectly. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew
Washington from the deal. Tehran responded by gradually exceeding the
limits imposed by the pact on its nuclear activities. U.S. President Joe
Biden has said he is willing to rejoin the pact if Iran return to full
compliance. \'Stabbed In The Back\' Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group, says that by inserting [the
war in Ukraine into the complicated nuclear negotiations, Russia appears
to be determined to upend the talks and take Iran down with
it.]{.underline} He suggested that [Russia appears no longer to be
interested in reviving the nuclear deal, which would allay Western
concerns over Iran's nuclear activities and allow Tehran to sell its
oil. And that could bring global oil prices down.]{.underline} "Neither
Iran\'s return to the oil market nor the peaceful resolution of a
Western security concern in the Middle East benefits the Kremlin," Vaez
told RFE/RL. "The leadership in Tehran is waking up to the reality that
you often get stabbed in the back by those you believed to have your
back." \'Tank The Talks\' Analysts say the scope of Russia's demands
will determine whether they complicate or scuttle the negotiations
entirely. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 5 said that
Moscow wanted written guarantees that sanctions ''launched by the U.S.
will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and
economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation
with Iran." Russia's new demands coincided with mounting international
pressure on Moscow over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February
24, a move that has resulted in unprecedented Western sanctions. U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed Russia's demands on March 6,
saying U.S. sanctions that are "being put in place and that have been
put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal."
"If it is simply exemptions that allow Russia to help Iran meet its
nuclear obligations in the deal, that is one thing," Eric Brewer, a
senior director at Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a Washington-based

something much bigger. [I don\'t see the United States giving Russia
that type of sanctions relief, even if it endangers a revival of the

and Russia have been able to cooperate on shared nonproliferation
interests in the past, even when tensions have been high. But he says it
is possible that Russia's recent demands \"tank the talks.\" \'Critical
Decision\' Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle
East studies at Johns Hopkins University, says [Russia's demands have
forced Iran to make a difficult choice: to stick by Russia and incur the
**diplomatic and economic costs** of the talks collapsing or to ditch
Moscow and endanger its ties with an ally.]{.underline} "Iran would have
to decide how important an agreement is to its national interest, and
whether it will allow talks it has invested so much in and built its
economic and foreign policies around \[to\] be taken hostage by Russia,"
Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to the Obama administration, told
RFE/RL. "[It will be a critical decision for Tehran]{.underline}." [Nasr
suggested that **sidelining Russia was possible**.]{.underline} "[The

would have to find ways to replace Russia's technical role under the
deal, including removing excess enriched uranium from Iran. "Given
enough time, you could probably come up with some workarounds for other
parties to take Russia\'s place on these technical areas," he says.
\"But it won\'t be easy, and time is in short supply. \"[At a practical

### 2AC -- Ukraine Thump Libya Impact

#### **Ukraine war has caused de-escalation in Libya.**

**Abdullah 4/20** \[Bilal Abdullah; ; 4-20-2022; Russia-Ukraine War and
the De-escalation in Libya; No Publication;
https://epc.ae/en/details/featured/russia-ukraine-war-and-the-de-escalation-in-libya;

[Libya has been relatively calm since the Russian war on Ukraine started
on February 24. Although this North African nation has long been viewed
as a potential arena for settling scores between Russia and the West,
the situation in Libya is currently moving in the opposite direction.
Its political disputes have become less severe, and the flashpoints
between the political rivals have decreased.]{.underline}

This analysis touches on three main areas of conflict between Russia and
the West in Libya in the post-February 24 period -- oil, the UN
mission's future, and military deployment. The analysis also examines
the impact of these points of contention on the local dispute and any
local party's ability to seize the transitional authority or manage any
settlement.

The Oil Factor

The dispute over oil revenues has been at the heart of the larger
conflict in Libya. [Controlling oil wealth creates a balance between the
two sides of the conflict]{.underline}. The eastern camp militarily
controls the oil facilities, i.e., production and export, while the
western camp controls the revenue distribution because the central bank
is located in the capital, Tripoli.

Considering this conflict, the international community tried to protect
the independence of the National Oil Corporation and moved, for months,
toward withholding export revenues from the Libyan Foreign Bank. Also, a
conflict over the powers between the Minister of Oil in the government
of Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, Muhammad Aoun, and the head of the National Oil
Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, deepened the Corporation's impartiality,
which was usually affiliated with the western Libya camp.

[Oil is now more critical for the western part of the country. Crude oil
is a critical tool in new Western policies designed to besiege Moscow
and undermine it economically and militarily by reducing Western
countries' dependence on Russian oil and gas. The idea is to deprive
Russia of a significant financing source. Therefore, the United States,
the architect of sanctions against Russia, is actively seeking to ensure
a stable oil supply from Libya.]{.underline}

Indeed, the West has taken the following steps in this regard:

[The embassies of the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy
in Libya issued a joint statement urging all actors in Libya to respect
the unity and independence of the National Oil Corporation]{.underline}.
They were urged not to politicize it or engage in any actions that would
undermine the stability of this institution. Remarkably, this statement
was issued on February 24, the same day the Russian invasion of Ukraine
began. \[1\]

UN Adviser Stephanie Williams tweeted, stressing the need to preserve
the independence and impartiality of the National Oil Corporation, the
Central Bank, and the Libyan Investment Authority and not subject them
to arbitrary pressures to employ them for the benefit of one party over
another. The US and British embassies retweeted that tweet, emphasizing
the same position. \[2\] This became clear about a month after the
Western embassies' statement referred to this position. It also
coincides with growing uncertainty in the oil market against the
backdrop of the Western-Russian conflict.

[On March 17, the United States ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland,
announced a proposal to introduce a short-term mechanism for managing
Libyan oil revenues that build on the previous arrangement, i.e.,
depositing oil revenues in the Libyan Foreign Bank.]{.underline} The new
mechanism assumes that the various parties publish transparent data on
expenditures and revenues, and the oil revenue distribution is limited
to salaries, subsidies, fuel production, and major imported goods such
as food and medicine. \[3\]

In early March, the National Oil Corporation announced that it had
agreed with British Petroleum to carry out exploration activities in the
Ghadames and Sirte basins. The agreement came about 10 days after the
British oil giant announced that it had quit its partnership with the
Russian oil company Rosneft following the Ukraine war. \[4\] Kate
English, Deputy British Ambassador to Libya, met Mustafa Sanalla, head
of the National Oil Corporation, on March 21 and discussed expanding
cooperation between British energy companies and the Libyan Corporation.
\[5\]

[UN Mission]{.underline}

The appointment of a UN envoy to Libya is likely to turn into a
contentious issue between Russia and Western countries. The UN Security
Council's mandate is scheduled to expire at the end of April, and the
Council will have to consider renewing it. There have been some key
developments related to this issue, including the following:

[The UN mission's mandate was renewed on the last day of January 2022
for only three months without appointing a UN envoy]{.underline}. This
British proposal offered a compromise between two American and Russian
draft resolutions. The US decision called for renewing the mission's
mandate until mid-September without appointing a UN envoy. However, the
resolution stipulated that Stephanie Williams, an American, would assume
the actual tasks of the UN envoy as an adviser to the Secretary-General
on Libyan affairs, a position she assumed on December 6, 2021. The goal
is that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will not have to seek the
Security Council's approval for the appointment. However, the Russian
draft resolution called for the mission's renewal until the end of April
only, with the appointment of a UN envoy by the Security Council without
delay.

With the date of the decision on renewing the mission's mandate
approaching, i.e., the end of April, and against the backdrop of a
raging US-Russian conflict, it is expected that the dispute over the
mission's future will return to the fore again, especially concerning
the issue of appointing a UN envoy.

In a direction opposite to the expected West-Russia escalation over the
mission's future, and specifically on the UN envoy job, some African
countries with considerable clout in the African Union cling to the
demand of appointing an African diplomat to the position of UN envoy
following the resignation of former envoy Ghassan Salame in March 2020.
[Re-introducing this demand in the coming period may be the best way to
shield the mission's mandate against the repercussions of international
escalation. Even the parties to the conflict seem willing to maintain
the ceasefire and reduce escalation to preserve the gains
achieved.]{.underline}

[Military Deployment]{.underline}

[There are many indications about how the Russia-Ukraine war will affect
Russia and its allies' military deployment in Libya. A large-scale
military escalation is unlikely in Libya during the next stage for
several reasons:]{.underline}

[Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to bring in fighters from
the Middle East to participate in military operations in Ukraine. On
March 11, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that 16,000
fighters from the Middle East were ready to volunteer for the
war.]{.underline} \[6\]

On March 20, [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced that Field
Marshal Khalifa Haftar had sent fighters to fight alongside the Russian
forces, among the forces announced by the Russian Defense Minister.
Wagner would supervise the transfer of fighters.]{.underline} \[7\]
However, the General Command in Libya officially denied these
statements. \[8\]

The British Ministry of Defense announced that [the fighters of the
Russian company Wagner were deployed in eastern Ukraine, which came at
the expense of the company's operations in Africa and
Syria]{.underline}. \[9\]

The "Syrians for Truth and Justice" organization has published a report
confirming that Russia has transferred Syrian fighters fighting in Libya
alongside Haftar forces to fight in Ukraine. The report was based on
testimonies from Syrian fighters and records of flights from Benghazi
and Damascus to Russia. \[10\]

British Ambassador to Libya Caroline Harrondale met Field Marshal
Khalifa Haftar at the General Command headquarters in Benghazi on March
27. The ambassador said that the meeting focused on the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, the importance of withdrawing all mercenaries from Libya,
and the need to avoid war returning to the country. \[11\]

[These indicators suggest a plan to reduce the support provided by
Russia to Haftar's forces at the level of human resources and prioritize
the war in Ukraine, which naturally means that there will be no
large-scale military escalation in Libya. However, in light of the
escalation of the conflict between Russia and the West led by the United
States and the increase in pressures on Russia, the Russian-Western
conflict will possibly not remain confined to Ukraine but rather erupt
in other flashpoints including Libya.]{.underline}

Therefore, foreign fighters wholly loyal to Russia are expected to
remain in Libya, given that Russia controls the oil negotiating card in
Libya.

Impact on the Political Track

The Russo-Ukrainian War had impacts on Libya's political process as
follows:

1\. Fathi Bashagha as the New Prime Minister: The project to install
Fathi Bashagha as the new prime minister is no longer enjoying
significant momentum, despite the man's alliance with the Russian-backed
parties in eastern Libya. Moscow was among the few capitals that openly
called for Bashagha to be able to exercise his new position in the
capital, Tripoli. On March 13, a group of residents of the cities of the
so-called Libya Oil Crescent threatened to shut down oil facilities in
the region and stop the export of oil if the UN mission continued to
support the Dbeibeh government, demanding that Fathi Bashagha be able to
take power in the capital. \[12\] This threat was already put into
practice in mid-April. The use of the oil card in support of Bashagha
sends negative messages to Western countries regarding attempts by the
eastern Libyan camp to justify Western concerns about oil management in
Libya and Russia's support for Bashagha taking power.

Contrary to expectations, on March 2, Bashagha publicly condemned the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and met the Ukrainian ambassador to Libya on
March 26, stressing his position in support of Ukraine. \[13\] On the
other hand, Bashagha is aware of the sensitivity of using the oil card
for political influence at this stage and that the United States would
reject this. Bashagha openly announced his refusal to use the oil card
to enable him to take power in Tripoli \[14\], which reflects his
commitment to keeping a distance from Moscow to avoid the political
price he might pay in his relationship with Western powers. He is also
keen to settle for a local alliance with the eastern Libyan camp. At the
same time, the control of its headquarters in the eastern and southern
regions has mounted pressure on the Dbeibeh government.

If the situation escalates around the Oil Crescent region within a
US-Russia conflict, and if Moscow decides to make Libya an arena for
settling accounts with the West, this would become the main challenge
for Bashagha. Part of the forces loyal to him is located in the
country's center, in an area separating the forces loyal to Haftar and
those affiliated with the Dbeibeh government in the western region.
Thus, in this case, Bashagha may find himself compelled to break up the
political partnership with the eastern Libyan camp, especially if the
conflict escalates in a way that undermines his chances of becoming
prime minister.

The only case that would make Bashagha accept a military escalation is
for his forces to storm Tripoli by force. On the other hand, he is
unlikely to accept that his forces will be involved in any confrontation
between Haftar's forces and the camp in western Libya, against the
backdrop of the US-Russia conflict.

[2. The Drawing Up of a New Constitutional Rule: Due to the new military
balance, primarily temporary, owing to the decrease in the number of
foreign fighters supporting Haftar, Moscow's Ukraine preoccupation, and
the decline in the chances of Bashagha being appointed prime minister,
the UN adviser could work on a draft constitutional rule. It was
achieved through a consensus between the House of Representatives and
the State Council, based on which the elections might be held next
June.]{.underline}

UN Adviser Stephanie Williams seeks to achieve a fundamental
breakthrough to break the political deadlock, thus preventing the
eastern Libyan camp from installing Bashagha for a new transitional
period. The objective is to prevent Dbeibeh from achieving his goal of
staying in power for a more extended period, as was the case with the
Fayez al-Sarraj government. Williams is under the pressure of the time
factor, whether the vote on the mission's mandate takes place at the end
of April or the end of the roadmap term comes at the end of June.

The House of Representatives is aware of the current international
balances following Western sanctions against Russia and the latter's
failure to provide sufficient support to the eastern Libyan camp. This
explains the Parliament's attempt to play on the time factor and not
respond to Stephanie's efforts to thwart and wait for a new
international order. Until then, the Parliament will continue to adhere
to the roadmap it adopted, which calls for the appointment of Bashagha
as prime minister.

On the other hand, Dbeibeh seeks to sabotage Stephanie's plans. He
declared that he was committed to his plan "to return the trust to the
people," based on which he formed a committee to draft an election law
to hold the vote during June. However, the chances of this plan becoming
a reality are almost non-existent. Dbeibeh wants to stay in power for a
more extended period, especially when Libya is no longer an urgent
priority on the international community's agenda.

Conclusions

[Although the crisis between Russia and the West is poised for further
escalation, it is unlikely to see the conflict spill over to Libya due
to differences over oil management and military deployment. Still, the
two sides might clash over the appointment of a new UN envoy. The Libyan
parties are seeking pragmatically to exploit the current international
situation to avoid any political losses regarding the conflict over the
transitional authority or the future of the settlement process. In this
context, the main actors are working, in various ways, to thwart the
efforts of the UN adviser to hold elections before the middle of this
year and to buy more time in anticipation of any new
developments.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Internal Link Turn

#### Russia only intervenes in North Africa to further its interests. Russia supports autocratic, corrupt leaders which is destabilizing and detrimental to African People

[Russia has been **aggressively pursuing** its strategic objectives in
Africa in recent years---securing a **foothold** in the eastern
Mediterranean, gaining **naval port access** in the Red Sea, expanding
**natural resource extraction** opportunities, **displacing Western
influence**, and promoting **alternatives to democracy** as a regional
norm. Africa, thus, is a "theater" for Russia's geostrategic interests
rather than a destination itself---a perspective reflected in the means
that Russia employs. Unlike most major external partners, Russia is not
investing significantly in conventional statecraft in Africa---e.g.,
economic investment, trade, and security assistance. Rather, Russia
relies on a series of asymmetric (and often extralegal) measures for
influence---mercenaries, arms-for-resource deals, opaque contracts,
election interference, and disinformation]{.underline}. PARTNERSHIP WITH
WHOM? [Russia's Africa-focused initiatives are typically concentrated on
propping up an embattled incumbent or close ally: Khalifa Haftar in
Libya]{.underline}, Faustin Archange Touad칠ra in the Central African
Republic (CAR), [and coup leaders Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in Mali and
Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in Sudan, among
others]{.underline}. To assess the future of [Russia-Africa relations,
therefore, it is necessary to be clear that the "partnerships" that
Russia seeks in Africa are not state- but elite-based. By helping these
often illegitimate and unpopular leaders to retain power, Russia is
cementing Africa's indebtedness to Moscow]{.underline}. This strategy
works for Russia and the respective leaders who gain international
diplomatic cover, resources to consolidate power domestically, a
mercenary force, arms, and revenues from resource deals. However,
[Russia's opaque engagements are inherently destabilizing for the
citizens of the targeted countries, resulting in stunted economic
development, human rights abuses, disenfranchisement of African
citizens, the perpetuation of illegitimate governments, and social
polarization]{.underline}. Through this model, Russia has been able to
advance its objectives with limited financial and political costs.
Accordingly, we can expect to see Moscow continuing to expand its
influence on the continent in 2022. FOCAL POINTS FOR AFRICA-RUSSIA
RELATIONS IN 2022 [Libya. Russia retains Wagner mercenary forces (former
Russian defense intelligence troops) and military assets on the ground
in support of its proxy, warlord Khalifa Haftar. Russia can be expected
to try and steer the outcome of the postponed presidential and
legislative elections with the aim of emerging as the principal
powerbroker]{.underline} in this [geo-strategically important
territory---with access to oil reserves]{.underline} and deep-water
ports in the eastern Mediterranean and a permanent presence on NATO's
southern flank. [Sudan. Russia has been striving to gain naval port
access in the Red Sea, especially Port Sudan. It also has longstanding
ties to the Sudanese military, elements of the ousted Bashir regime, and
gold trafficking networks in the west]{.underline}. Continuation of the
military government in Khartoum provides a ready entry point for
expanded Russian influence. [Mali. The military coup in Mali has
provided Russia an opportunity to become a pivotal actor in the Sahel.
We can expect Moscow to provide political cover to the junta of Assimi
Go칦ta as it seeks to avoid a transition back to a democratic
government]{.underline}. Indications are that Wagner mercenaries have
already been deployed in support of the junta. Guinea. Russia has long
been a patron of former president Alpha Cond칠, who had been a strong
supporter of Russia's extensive mining (bauxite) interests in Guinea.
Following Cond칠's ouster in a coup in September 2021, Moscow can be
expected to refocus its diplomatic efforts on propping up the military
junta of Colonel Mamady Doumbouya in return for Moscow's continued
political sway and unencumbered access in the mining sector. Gulf of
Guinea. Having consolidated its position in the CAR in 2021, Russia is
set to expand its influence in nearby Republic of the Congo, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon in 2022. Moscow has been
cultivating ties with leaders of all three countries with an eye on
becoming a more significant player in the lucrative oil and mineral
networks of Central Africa. Angola. President Jo칚o Louren칞o is
contending for a second term in office in 2022 amid a long recession,
criticisms for increasing authoritarianism, and divisions within his
ruling party. Russia's opportunistic strategy of coming to the aid of
isolated leaders as a means of enhancing Moscow's leverage makes
Louren칞o an attractive target. His military academy training in the
USSR, Russia's extensive Cold War era ties to Angola, and Angola's vast
diamond, oil, gold, and mineral resources will all factor into increased
Russian attention on Louren칞o in 2022. CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT AND
SCRUTINY Since [Russia's engagements in Africa are typically predicated
on co-opting leaders facing limited checks and balances, they are nearly
**always detrimental to African citizens** who must endure **deepened
institutionalized corruption, diverted public revenues, unaccountable
leaders, and instability**]{.underline}. Reform, therefore, will not
come from these leaders but from African citizens, which will entail
greater civil society engagement, enhanced transparency around
contracts, and higher levels of scrutiny of any deals struck with
Russia. Building more mutually beneficial Africa-Russia relations
depends on changes in both substance and process. Such a shift would
require Russia to establish more conventional bilateral engagements with
African institutions and not just individuals. These initiatives would
focus on strengthening trade, investment, technology transfer, and
educational exchanges. If transparently negotiated and equitably
implemented, such Russian initiatives would be welcomed by many
Africans.

#### Russia seeks to further its strategic interests in Africa, propping up authoritarian leaders, undermining democracy, and destroying African sovereignty.

taken with its forays into Africa in recent years.]{.underline} Drawing
from its Syria playbook, [Russia has **propped up proxies** in Libya,
Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan. Moscow also has its sights on
another half dozen African leaders facing varying degrees of
vulnerability. In the process, African citizen and sovereign interests
have given way to Russian priorities. This**elite cooption
strategy**effectively servesRussia's strategic objectives in
Africa.]{.underline} These include, first, to gain a foothold in the
southern Mediterranean and Red Sea, putting Russia in a position to
threaten NATO's southern flank and international shipping chokeholds.
Second, to [demonstrate Russia's Great Power status whose interests must
be considered in every region of the world.]{.underline} And third, to
[displace western influence in Africa while **undermining support for
democracy.** Russia has often used **extralegal tools**맚o pursue its
objectives on the continent. It has deployed **mercenaries**, run
**disinformation campaigns**, **interfered in elections** and **bartered

has enabled Moscow to expand its influence in Africa more rapidly,
arguably, than any other external actor since 2018 whenRussia ramped up
its Africa engagements. [Regrettably for African citizens, these
**tactics are all inherently destabilising**. Moreover, the result is
disenfranchisement and **diminished African sovereignty**. Russia's
expanding influence portends a **bleak vision for Africa**.]{.underline}
In effect, [Russia is attempting to export its governance model -- of
an**authoritarian, kleptocratic, and transactional regime**-- onto
Africa.]{.underline} This is especially problematic since there are at
least a handful of African leaders who are more than happy to go down
this path. Never mind that this [**diverges wildly from the맋emocratic
aspirations held by** the vast majority of **African**
citizen**s**.]{.underline} The United Nations' vote on Russia's invasion
in Ukraine provides a useful prism to understand relationships between
Moscow and particular African countries. It reveals a spectrum of
governance norms and visions for Africa. It is through these lenses and
interests that groups of African countries can be expected to engage
with Russia moving forward -- with far-reaching consequences for
democracy, security and sovereignty on the continent. Puppets, patrons
and pushback The [UN General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian
aggression]{.underline} garnered only one dissenting African vote --
Eritrea. This was accompanied by strong denunciations of the Russian
attack on Ukraine by the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community
of West African States. The current chair of the AU, Senegal's President
Macky Sall, and AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat also
criticised Russia's unprovoked war. In total, 28 of Africa's 54
countries voted to condemn the Russian invasion, 16 abstained and 9 did
not vote. All in all, the vote was a remarkable rebuke of Moscow from a
continent where many African leaders' worldviews are shaped by a posture
of non-alignment, raw legacies from the Cold War, African diplomatic
politesse, and a desire to remain neutral in Great Power rivalries. The
vote also revealed a[widening segmentation of governance norms in
Africa](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/Africa-Year-in-Review-2021.pdf#page=16).
And it shows that African relations with Russia from here on in will not
be uniform -- nor abruptly reversed. The [African countries]{.underline}
that [abstained]{.underline}, or did not vote, did so for a variety of
reasons. The most obvious category of country [unwilling to condemn
Russia]{.underline} was those with African leaders who have been
co-opted by Moscow. These included Faustin-Archange Touad칠ra in the
Central African Republic, Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in
[Sudan]{.underline}, and Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in [Mali]{.underline}.
These leaders lack legitimacy domestically. They depend on Moscow's
political and mercenary support to hold onto power. A second category
among the countries that abstained or did not vote is those with leaders
who have patronage ties with Russia. Those in power in
[Algeria]{.underline}, Angola, Burundi, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea,
Madagascar, Mozambique, South Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe benefit from
Russian arms, disinformation or political cover. These leaders,
moreover, have no interest in democratic processes that may threaten
their hold on power. Others who abstained or did not vote likely did so
for ideological reasons rooted in their traditions of non-alignment.
These included [Morocco]{.underline}, Namibia, Senegal and South Africa.
While they may maintain ties to Moscow, they are appalled by Russia's
imperialistic actions. By and large, they support the upholding of
international law to maintain peace and security. Those who voted to
condemn the invasion included leading African democracies and
democratisers. These comprised Botswana, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Malawi,
Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Kenya, Seychelles, Sierra Leone and Zambia.
They represent a mix of motivations. But I calculated that the median
Global Freedom score for this group of 28 countries based on Freedom
House's annual (0-100) ratings is 20 points higher than those that did
not vote to condemn. The[powerful speech by Kenya's ambassador to the

**executed, tortured, and beaten civilians** since 2019,]{.underline}
Human Rights Watch said today. National authorities, the country's
Special Criminal Court (SCC), or the International Criminal Court (ICC),
should investigate these incidents as well as other credible allegations
of abuse by Russia-linked forces with a view to criminal prosecution.
Several Western governments, and United Nations experts and special
rapporteurs have found evidence that the forces linked to Russia
operating in the Central African Republic include a significant number
of members of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military security
contractor망ith apparent links to the Russian government. On April 15,
the United Nations announced it would investigate the circumstances in
which at least 10 people were killed in the northeast, with some initial
reports alleging Russian forces may have been involved. ["There is
**compelling evidence** that Russian-identified forces supporting the
Central African Republic's government have committed **grave abuses
against civilians** with **complete impunity**,"]{.underline} said Ida
Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. "The failure
of the Central African Republic government and its partners to
forcefully denounce these abuses, and to identify and prosecute those
responsible, will most likely only [fuel further crimes in Africa and
beyond."]{.underline} Between February 2019 and November 2021, Human
Rights Watch interviewed 21 people in person and 19 others by phone,
including 10 victims and 15 witnesses, about [abuses they said were
committed by men with white skin speaking Russian, a language the

carrying military-grade weapons and wearing beige khaki clothes, scarves
to cover their faces, military boots, gloves, and sunglasses. In August

[Mr. Hifter did not want to talk peace.]{.underline}

A former Libyan Army general and onetime C.I.A. client, [Mr. Hifter
wanted a White House blessing for a surprise attack to seize Tripoli,
the capital, before the peace talks commenced]{.underline}.

Mr. Bolton did not say no.

The attack, launched last April 4, backfired badly. Mr. Hifter [failed
to capture Tripoli, overextended his forces and restarted a civil war
--- killing thousands and displacing hundreds of thousands
more]{.underline}. The fighting has cut off the flow of Libyan oil,
[injected new volatility into the region and severely diminished
Washington's influence]{.underline}.

[But one apparent winner has emerged: the Kremlin. Russia has operated
with cold-eyed cynicism, taking advantage of three years of muddled
messages from the Trump administration to become a critical kingmaker in
Libya]{.underline}, a geopolitical prize with vast energy reserves and a
strategic location on the Mediterranean.

Mr. Bolton's call with Mr. Hifter --- described by a former senior
administration official as well as three Western diplomats briefed by
both Mr. Hifter and American officials --- appears to have played into
the Russian machinations.

Days before the call, private Russian operatives in Libya reported to
Moscow that Mr. Hifter was a flawed and outmatched military leader sure
to fail if he ever tried to conquer the capital, according to secret
Russian documents seized in Tripoli and viewed by The New York Times.
[The operatives saw opportunity in his weakness and suggested that
Russia could win leverage over Mr. Hifter if it sent mercenaries to
bolster his so-called Libyan National Army.]{.underline}

["Russia will maintain a loyal and strong ally in the structure of the
LNA," the operatives argued, "which Hifter will have to contend
with."]{.underline}

Washington's inconsistent position on Libya --- officially supporting
the peace process even as the White House has signaled that President
Trump favors Mr. Hifter --- has played a major role in prolonging the
chaos. The absence of a strong American policy has opened the door to
interference from competing American partners, including Turkey, Egypt
and the United Arab Emirates.

Yet it is [Russia that is now best positioned to dominate
Libya.]{.underline}

An arm of the [Kremlin controls dozens of social media accounts
promoting Mr. Hifter and other favored clients]{.underline}, including
the eldest son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's former dictator,
according to the operatives' report. The same Kremlin operation has
acquired an ownership stake in a pro-Qaddafi Libyan satellite network
and advised a pro-Hifter network as well, the operatives wrote.

At the same time, the Russian military has worked behind the scenes to
surround Mr. Hifter with many of its old partners from the Qaddafi-era
security forces, encouraging Qaddafi henchmen to return from exile. The
Kremlin also has built ties to a potential governing party-in-waiting,
the documents show.

And the Kremlin followed the operatives' prescient advice. [When Mr.
Hifter's assault stalled, Moscow propped up his sagging advance with
thousands of trained mercenaries who continue to operate in
Libya.]{.underline}

Representatives for the White House and Mr. Bolton declined to comment.

But alarmed American lawmakers have begun asking how the White House
appears to have ended up backing the same side as Moscow.

During a recent Senate hearing on Libya, lawmakers wondered how the
United States could fault Russia for propping up a client when the White
House appeared to like him as well. The president sounded "inclined to
support Hifter" even as the State Department seemed to oppose him, said
Senator Mitt Romney, the Utah Republican.

"Is there consistency?" Mr. Romney asked.

"I can say unequivocally," David Schenker, the assistant secretary of
state for Near Eastern affairs, insisted with exasperation, "We do not
support the Hifter offensive."

Courting the President

A campaign to get the White House behind Mr. Hifter started almost as
soon as Mr. Trump was elected.

Mr. Hifter's most important patron, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of
the United Arab Emirates, pitched Mr. Hifter to members of Mr. Trump's
foreign policy team at a secret meeting in New York in December 2016,
according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Mr. Trump has jokingly
called "my favorite dictator," also took up the Hifter cause five months
later when he visited the White House.

"Hifter was a core talking point in every meeting with the Egyptians and
Emiratis," said Andrew Miller, a former member of the National Security
Council staff and now a researcher at the Project on Middle East
Democracy, a Washington-based nonprofit.

Libya had foundered in chaos since a NATO air campaign helped oust
Colonel Qaddafi during the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Extortionist
militias, militant extremists and migrant traffickers ran amok as the
country was divided into fiefs. Officially, the United States recognized
only the United Nations-sponsored provisional government in Tripoli.

But Crown Prince Mohammed and Mr. el-Sisi told Mr. Trump that the
provisional government was hopelessly weak and riddled with Islamists.
They argued that only Mr. Hifter could prevent Islamists from taking
power in Tripoli, which the Arab leaders said would create a domino
effect across the region, according to two former senior administration
officials.

Mr. Hifter had vowed since 2014 to eradicate political Islam and take
power as Libya's new military ruler. Yet he had quietly formed an
alliance with a rival faction of extremists, Saudi-style
ultraconservatives known as Salafis.

As they lobbied Mr. Trump, Crown Prince Mohammed and Mr. el-Sisi
overlooked that contradiction. They were also simultaneously working
closely with Russia. Egypt had opened a secret Russian base to supply
Mr. Hifter's forces, to the alarm of Western officials worried about
Moscow's expanding influence.

The two Arab leaders, though, found a sympathetic ear in Mr. Bolton, who
became national security adviser in the spring of 2018 and had
previously led a far-right think tank known for sweeping attacks on
political Islam.

The Bolton-Hifter phone call last spring came at a critical moment. Even
as the peace talks were approaching, Mr. Hifter had moved his forces
into a strategic oasis town south of Tripoli and was poised for a
surprise attack.

When Mr. Hifter asked for consent, Mr. Bolton's answer was "a yellow
light," not a green or a red one, the former senior administration
official said. Yet three Western diplomats briefed on the call by both
Mr. Hifter and senior American officials described Mr. Bolton as less
equivocal: If you are going to attack, do it quickly, he told Mr.
Hifter, according to all three diplomats.

Mr. Hifter counted that as an explicit assent, all three diplomats said.

The April 4 attack stunned the world. The United Nations secretary
general, Ant칩nio Guterres, had just landed in Tripoli for the peace
talks. He urged Mr. Hifter to pull back, a message endorsed by Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo. American military forces hurriedly left the city.

But as the fighting was underway, Mr. Hifter's powerful allies were
lobbying Mr. Trump to show his support, White House officials said. Mr.
el-Sisi pressed the president in person last year on April 9, and Crown
Prince Mohammed over the phone on April 18.

The next day, the White House said in a statement that the president had
called Mr. Hifter to commend his "significant role in fighting
terrorism." A day after the call, Mr. Hifter's forces began shelling
civilian neighborhoods of Tripoli.

"It seemed as if the Americans were switching sides in a way that didn't
make sense," said Peter Millett, the British ambassador to Libya until
2018, noting that the Tripoli government had been the main Libyan
partner to the United States military in counterterrorism.

"There was confusion and massive surprise in the international
community," he said.

Col. Ahmed Mismari, a spokesman for Mr. Hifter, declined to comment on
the call with Mr. Bolton but said the Libyan commander appreciated the
president's support.

[Russian Hedging]{.underline}

Even before the assault on Tripoli began, the Russians had concluded it
would be a disaster for Mr. Hifter.

The Russian operatives in Libya worked for an obscure research center
linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president,
Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Prigozhin is also described by American officials
as the leader of a Kremlin-linked private security company, the Wagner
Group. Their teams of mercenaries have overseen Russian efforts to
meddle in the politics of Ukraine, Syria and several African countries.

The leader of the Libyan team, Maxim Shugaley, had been identified in
news reports in 2018 trying to pay bribes and spread disinformation to
turn elections in Madagascar. Tipped off by American intelligence,
according to a person involved, a militia allied with the Tripoli
provisional government eventually detained Mr. Shugaley and his
interpreter. A third operative eluded capture, Libyan officials said.

After detaining Mr. Shugaley, the security agents found a report in his
hotel room that his team had sent to Moscow in March of last year,
shortly before the Hifter-Bolton call. Dossier, a London research center
critical of Mr. Putin, obtained a copy of the seized report and provided
portions to The New York Times. Senior Libyan officials authenticated
the text independently.

For several years, [Russia had provided military supplies to Mr. Hifter
and printed millions of dollars in newly minted Libyan currency for him
to distribute.]{.underline}

But the secret report showed that the operatives were much more
skeptical of Mr. Hifter than were the Arab rulers advising the White
House.

Mr. Hifter, now 76, had recurring health problems. He won few military
victories and had instead gained territory by "buying off local tribal
groups for the right to place the flag," so that he could "raise his
significance in the eyes of internal and external players," the report
stated.

Not only did the operatives conclude that any advance on Tripoli was
almost certain to fail, as did an offensive in 2014, they also warned
that Mr. Hifter was stubborn and had become increasingly "difficult" to
his Russian advisers.

["Hifter is using Russian help to increase his
significance,"]{.underline} the operatives wrote, but "there is a
serious basis to suggest that in the event of his military victory,
Hifter will not be loyal to Russian interests."

[The operatives recommended the Kremlin hedge its bets on Mr. Hifter by
allying with Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the eldest son of the former
dictator]{.underline}. The operatives said their "company" had acquired
a stake in a pro-Qaddafi satellite network and revitalized its
broadcasts.

A longtime partner to Russia under his father, Mr. Qaddafi, now 47, was
imprisoned in Libya in 2011 before somehow regaining his freedom. Now he
is at large and plotting a comeback, according to Libyans close to him
and Western diplomats familiar with intelligence reports on his
movements.

But the Russians also identified a new opening with Mr. Hifter: The
Kremlin should insert paid mercenaries loyal to Russia into his
faltering military. Sudanese paramilitary forces were ready to do the
job, the operatives insisted, and could give Moscow crucial leverage.

Game Changer

[The contingents of mercenaries from the Wagner Group began arriving via
Sudan last September, according to Western diplomats tracking their
movements.]{.underline}

"That was the big game changer," Ambassador Richard Norland, the
American envoy to Libya, said at a recent briefing. "It's clear the
Russians see strategic advantage now in Libya --- low risk and high
gain."

[To deepen its influence, the Kremlin has also organized secret meetings
in Moscow between Mr. Hifter's supporters and former officers in the
Qaddafi-era military and security services]{.underline}, according to
Western diplomats and other analysts who have spoken to Libyan
participants.

Musa Ibrahim, a former Qaddafi spokesman, declined to comment on
specific meetings in Moscow but acknowledged that Russia had been
"bringing together" the Hifter and Qaddafi officers, especially since
the assault on Tripoli.

This month, on the anniversary of Mr. Hifter's attack, the United
Nations urged a halt to the fighting to respond to the coronavirus
pandemic now spreading in Libya.

But Mr. Hifter has continued shelling Tripoli, even targeting a major
hospital. And the [Russian mercenaries have given Russia a de facto veto
over any end to the conflict]{.underline}.

["This has been Russia's dream since World War II,"]{.underline} said
Fathi Bashagha, the interior minister of the Tripoli government, quoting
Winston Churchill's wartime statement that Moscow saw Libya as the "soft
underbelly" of Europe.

["To get Russian feet on Libyan soil."]{.underline}

[Bachagha's Appointment Has the Potential for Stability]{.underline}

Days before the scheduled -- and already compromised elections -- on
December 24, Bachagha went to Benghazi where he met Haftar, head of the
self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) on December 21, 2021. This
meeting 춼-- at Haftar's invitation no less -- was remarkable. Its
remarkability can only be explained by noting that in April 2019, Haftar
launched the "Flood of Dignity" campaign to liberate Tripoli from the
militias and Brotherhood-dominated Government of National Accord (GNA)
--- the original internationally supported transitional Libyan
government --- arresting all members of the Muslim Brotherhood and
dissolving the political movement.

That same December, Turkey's ambassador to Tripoli met Aqila Saleh of
the House of Representatives, the Haftar-affiliated Libyan parliament in
Tobruk. Around the same time, a delegation of GNA members from Tripoli
flew to Turkey and met President Erdogan himself. This series of
unlikely meetings suggests that Turkey and Haftar have reached a
tactical agreement to soften their differences in order to stabilize
Libya.

[Evidently, Turkey has decided to change its game: it is no longer
interested in staying in -- and outright controlling -- Libya. Erdogan
calculated that Turkey's continued presence in Libya created a problem
for fellow NATO allies (Italy, France, and the US) which are eager to
increase stability in North Africa, halt the flow of migrants, and
secure important energy sources.]{.underline}

This situation parallels that of Tunisia, where Erdogan maintained ties
to Rachid Ghannouchi and the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Ennahda, and
where the political cards have also been shuffled with the dismissal of
parliament by President Kais Saied. [Therefore, a shift in relations
between Ankara and the Muslim Brotherhood has occurred in the
Mediterranean. And without Turkey's backing, the movement and its
political representatives have been weakened.]{.underline}

Was it a Coup?

Technically, Bachagha's appointment does not represent a coup. Indeed,
as in all democracies, the executive governs with the trust of the
parliament. [And the "institution" in Tobruk that appointed Bachagha is
Libya's official parliament, elected by the people in 2014]{.underline}.
That said, the militias in 2014 were affiliated with Bachagha, implying
that any objectives the new prime minister sets toward stability should
be easier to achieve.

Meanwhile, following the indefinite postponement of the elections,
Turkey and Russia -- until then rivals over Libyan matters --- moved
closer, building a common front and incubating the alliance of former
enemies Haftar and Bachagha. This is especially impressive given that
Bachagha fought against Haftar two years ago. [Despite this ideal
situation -- for what could be more conducive to peace than a mutually
beneficial alliance between two former]{.underline} enemies -- there is
an unlikely obstacle: the United Nations. Indeed, the UN has made it
known that it does not recognize Bachagha and will continue to recognize
Dbeibah.

In the current circumstances, which could lead Libya out of its
darkness, the UN's position represents a real and counterproductive
interference in Libya's internal affairs. Until recently, the government
in Tripoli had the support of the UN, but not of the parliament. Today,
the situation is that of one UN-backed prime minister and another prime
minister who enjoys the support of the Libyan parliament. If the Misrata
militia close to Bachagha has allied itself with Haftar's LNA -- the two
single most powerful armed organizations in the country -- the intensity
and amount of fighting may also decrease drastically.

As for elections? They may or may not happen this year -- or even the
next. But there's no denying the fact that [perhaps for the first time
since 2011, Libyans have more or less come together]{.underline}.
Bachagha is in an unprecedented position to build a unified Libya, and
the current scenario is one of renewed diplomacy. If the UN and the West
care about elections and democracy, they should welcome these new
arrangements as they will lead to more stability and only then,
encourage a vote.

[Bachagha has the potential to unite the country]{.underline}, even if
some suspect him to be Haftar's Trojan horse. The UN could be more
productive and save face by encouraging a scenario that supports the
Libyan parliament's decision to back Bachagha while keeping Haftar at
bay.

#### Russia and Turkey are pulling out.

**Klapper '21** \[Rebecca Klapper; ; 6-23-2021; Russia, Turkey reach
agreement to remove troops from Libya, U.S. official says; Newsweek;

[A senior U.S. official said Russia and Turkey have tentatively reached
an agreement to begin the process of withdrawing foreign troops from
Libya in agreement with Germany\'s Foreign Minister pledging to remove
foreign forces from Libya.]{.underline}

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the
Associated Press that the deal is not yet done, but each country is
prepared to discuss an incremental withdrawal of about 300 troops by
both sides.

\"[We will not let up, and we will not rest, until the last foreign
forces have left Libya \... wherever they come from,\"]{.underline}
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.

Maas said that Russia and Turkey have been heavily involved on opposite
sides, but acknowledged that a [withdrawal would have to be taken \"step
by step\" while also maintaining balance so one side doesn\'t gain an
advantage over the other]{.underline}.

Libya\'s transitional government underlined its commitment to holding
elections on Dec. 24 at a conference Wednesday with powers that have
interests in the North African country, while the German hosts vowed to
keep up pressure until all foreign forces have been withdrawn from
Libya.

[Germany and the United Nations brought together 17 countries at the
conference in Berlin. Libya\'s transitional leadership was joined by
foreign ministers from Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, France and
Italy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and senior officials from
Russia, the United Arab Emirates and others.]{.underline}

The meeting followed up on a January 2020 conference where leaders
agreed to respect an arms embargo and to push the country\'s warring
parties to reach a full cease-fire. Germany has tried to act as an
intermediary.

Maas said the [meeting \"marked a new phase\" and that \"we are no
longer only talking about Libya, but above all with
Libya.\"]{.underline}

Participants welcomed progress since the process was launched. An
October cease-fire agreement including a demand that all foreign
fighters and mercenaries leave Libya within 90 days led to a deal on the
elections in December and the transitional government that took office
in February.

Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush said the [transitional government
came \"with a vision of how best to re-establish stability in our
country]{.underline} and pave the way for free, inclusive and safe
elections on Dec. 24.\"

Wednesday\'s conference saw [powers involved in Libya recommit to
refraining from interfering in the country\'s internal affairs and
stating that foreign forces and mercenaries need to be withdrawn
\"without delay\"]{.underline} --- something on which there has been
little progress.

Asked what guarantees the countries involved are giving to withdraw
foreign fighters, Maas pointed to the fact that they had gathered for
the conference.

Mangoush said there was [\"progress\" regarding mercenaries, \"so
hopefully within the coming days mercenaries from both sides are going
to be withdrawn,\" creating more trust and leading to further
steps]{.underline}.

A further challenge will be to start bringing all armed groups in Libya
under a joint military command.

Speaking earlier Wednesday ahead of the conference, Blinken said that
[\"we share the goal of a sovereign, stable, unified, secure Libya free
from foreign interference --- it\'s what the people of Libya deserve,
it\'s critical to regional security as well.\"]{.underline}

\"For that to happen, national elections need to go forward in December
and that means urgent agreement is needed on constitutional and legal
issues that would undergird those elections,\" he said. \"And the Oct.
23 cease-fire agreement has to be fully implemented, including by
withdrawing all foreign forces from Libya.\"

[Conference participants supported efforts toward a reconciliation
process and committed to helping Libyan authorities \"in developing a
comprehensive approach to addressing migration,\" including the closure
of detention centers.]{.underline}

National Army launched an April offensive to seize Tripoli from the

with the Wagner Group, a paramilitary organization with ties to the
Kremlin, have been in Libya for some time, working on behalf of Moscow
and helping Haftar in his bid to capture Tripoli, however Schenker said
that Russia is now deploying regular uniformed personnel there as well.
["Russian regulars are being deployed in significant numbers to support
the LNA," Schenker said, describing their presence as "incredibly
destabilizing." The presence of the Russian troops "raises the specter
of **large-scale casualties among the civilian
population**,"]{.underline} Schenker said. His comments come days after
a senior US delegation met with Haftar on Sunday to "discuss steps to

[Russia has been aggressively pursuing its strategic objectives in
Africa in recent years]{.underline}---securing a foothold in the eastern
Mediterranean, gaining naval port access in the Red Sea, expanding
natural resource extraction opportunities[, displacing Western
influence, and promoting alternatives to democracy as a regional
norm.]{.underline}

[Africa, thus, is a "theater" for Russia's geostrategic
interests]{.underline} rather than a destination itself---a perspective
reflected in the means that Russia employs. Unlike most major external
partners, [Russia is not investing significantly in conventional
statecraft in Africa]{.underline}---e.g., economic investment, trade,
and security assistance. Rather, Russia [relies on a series of
asymmetric (and often extralegal) measures for influence---mercenaries,
arms-for-resource deals, opaque contracts, election interference, and
disinformation.]{.underline}

PARTNERSHIP WITH WHOM?

[Russia's Africa-focused initiatives are typically concentrated on
propping up an embattled incumbent or close ally:]{.underline} Khalifa
Haftar in Libya, Faustin Archange Touad칠ra in the Central African
Republic (CAR), and coup leaders Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in Mali and
Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in Sudan, among others.

To assess the future of Russia-Africa relations, therefore, it is
necessary to be clear that the "partnerships" that Russia seeks in
Africa are not state- but elite-based. [By helping these often
illegitimate and unpopular leaders to retain power, Russia is cementing
Africa's indebtedness to Moscow.]{.underline}

This strategy works for Russia and the respective leaders who gain
international diplomatic cover, resources to consolidate power
domestically, a mercenary force, arms, and revenues from resource deals.
However, [Russia's opaque engagements are **inherently destabilizing**
for the citizens of the targeted countries, resulting in stunted
economic development, human rights abuses, disenfranchisement of African
citizens, the perpetuation of illegitimate governments, and social
polarization.]{.underline}

Through this model, Russia has been able to advance its objectives with
limited financial and political costs. Accordingly, we can expect to see
Moscow continuing to expand its influence on the continent in 2022.

FOCAL POINTS FOR AFRICA-RUSSIA RELATIONS IN 2022

[Libya. Russia retains Wagner mercenary forces (former Russian defense
intelligence troops) and military assets on the ground in support of its
proxy, warlord Khalifa Haftar. Russia can be expected to try and steer
the outcome of the postponed presidential and legislative elections with
the aim of emerging as the principal powerbroker in this
geo-strategically important territory---with access to oil reserves and
deep-water ports in the eastern Mediterranean and a permanent presence
on NATO's southern flank.]{.underline}

[Sudan]{.underline}. Russia has been striving to gain naval port access
in the Red Sea, especially Port Sudan. It also has longstanding ties to
the Sudanese military, elements of the ousted Bashir regime, and gold
trafficking networks in the west. Continuation of the military
government in Khartoum provides a ready entry point for expanded Russian
influence.

[Mali. The military coup in Mali has provided Russia an opportunity to
become a pivotal actor in the Sahel.]{.underline} We can expect Moscow
to provide political cover to the junta of Assimi Go칦ta as it seeks to
avoid a transition back to a democratic government. Indications are that
Wagner mercenaries have already been deployed in support of the junta.

[Guinea]{.underline}. Russia has long been a patron of former president
Alpha Cond칠, who had been a strong supporter of Russia's extensive
mining (bauxite) interests in Guinea. Following Cond칠's ouster in a coup
in September 2021, Moscow can be expected to refocus its diplomatic
efforts on propping up the military junta of Colonel Mamady Doumbouya in
return for Moscow's continued political sway and unencumbered access in
the mining sector.

[Gulf of Guinea.]{.underline} Having consolidated its position in the
CAR in 2021, Russia is set to expand its influence in nearby Republic of
the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon in 2022.
Moscow has been cultivating ties with leaders of all three countries
with an eye on becoming a more significant player in the lucrative oil
and mineral networks of Central Africa.

[Angola]{.underline}. President Jo칚o Louren칞o is contending for a second
term in office in 2022 amid a long recession, criticisms for increasing
authoritarianism, and divisions within his ruling party. Russia's
opportunistic strategy of coming to the aid of isolated leaders as a
means of enhancing Moscow's leverage makes Louren칞o an attractive
target. His military academy training in the USSR, Russia's extensive
Cold War era ties to Angola, and Angola's vast diamond, oil, gold, and
mineral resources will all factor into increased Russian attention on
Louren칞o in 2022.

CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT AND SCRUTINY

[Since Russia's engagements in Africa are typically predicated on
co-opting leaders facing limited checks and balances, they are nearly
always detrimental to African citizens who must endure deepened
institutionalized corruption, diverted public revenues, unaccountable
leaders, and instability.]{.underline} Reform, therefore, will not come
from these leaders but from African citizens, which will entail greater
civil society engagement, enhanced transparency around contracts, and
higher levels of scrutiny of any deals struck with Russia.

On 24 February 2022, [Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a
full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. The decision was based on a
series of fatally flawed situational assessments, including an
overestimation of the fighting abilities of the Russian army, an
underestimation of the determination of the Ukrainian army and people,
and a faulty evaluation of the West's willingness to impose serious
economic sanctions. The massive sanctions that have since been imposed
on Russia's economy have led to a freeze on half of the central bank's
reserves, a fall in the value of the rouble of more than 40 per cent,
and an exodus of most Western companies from Russia. Increasing
political repression and a fear of border closures caused several
hundred thousand Russians -- a significant part of the country's
intellectual elite -- to flee abroad. The economic consequences of these
developments will be disastrous.]{.underline} At the moment, neither the
Russian government nor most Russian people seem to realise the extent of
the economic catastrophe that is already sure to happen. In the best
scenario, Russia's economy will shrink by 10 to 20 per cent this year, a
somewhat worse decline than during the 2008 financial crisis. But if
[the war continues, and new war crimes lead to additional sanctions, the
economic disaster might be comparable to that caused by the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. A self-inflicted catastrophe There
are few, if any, politicians in recent history who have inflicted such
massive harm on their own country in such a short time as Putin has done

middle-income country well integrated into the global economy, with a
large part of its population enjoying a standard of living comparable to
that of some European states. Russians could choose from a similar range
of consumer goods to people elsewhere in the world, occasionally travel
abroad for a holiday, and expect to lead a relatively stable and
peaceful life. Today, [Russia has become an almost completely isolated
pariah state]{.underline}. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria were
the only countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning the
Russian war in Ukraine. According to a list compiled by researchers at
Yale University, by 13 March, 350 foreign companies had ceased or
curtailed their operations in Russia, with only 34 overseas firms
continuing to operate normally. As both Airbus and Boeing are no longer
servicing Russian planes, Russia's airlines were forced to stop
international flights and might soon be forced to stop domestic flights
as well. [Travel within the country will be pushed back to where it was
in the early twentieth century. It is unlikely that any of these
companies will return to Russia if the current situation continues or
deteriorates. As a consequence, the country will be deprived of many of
the high-technology and consumer goods it has been importing until now.
As Russia produces very few hi-tech goods, this will seriously affect
the Russian economy, disrupting supply chains and making the country's
situation similar to that of Iran during the last 30 years]{.underline}.
A similarly heavy blow will be the brain drain caused by the recent wave
of repression. Most of the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled
Russia in recent weeks are highly qualified specialists and researchers
who are difficult to replace. The remaining scientists in Russia will be
cut off from international networks, as worldwide academic institutions
have cut all ties with Russian universities. The consequences for
science, research, and innovation in Russia will be devastating. Dark
prospects for the future [Even in the best possible scenario of
immediate peace, it would take several years to repair the damage
already caused]{.underline}. Such a scenario would probably require the
fall of the Putin regime, and a new government that ends the war and
takes responsibility for Russia's actions, to open up the possibility of
bringing the country back into the international community. Even in this
highly unlikely scenario, however, [Russia's population will have
suffered substantial economic harm, and the horrors already committed in
Ukraine will leave deep scars for Ukrainians and Russians
alike]{.underline}. In what is unfortunately a more likely scenario, the
war will drag on for a considerable time, potentially leading to a
complete end of Western oil and gas imports from Russia. Although China
might be willing to jump in, Russia will not be able to significantly
increase its oil and gas exports in the near future, as the existing
infrastructure in the Far East is already operating at full capacity.
Moscow will thus have to rely on Chinese loans to import Chinese
consumer goods. As a result, [Russia might turn into some large-scale
version of North Korea: economically dependent on China and with a
government that through tight control of travel and information will try
to prevent its population from finding out the true reasons for the
disaster that has befallen it.]{.underline}

[From a strategic point of view, Putin's attack on Ukraine has thrown
back Russia to its weakest position since World War II. Ukrainians have
shown they are ready to fight and die, and that they will never accept a
Russian puppet regime]{.underline}. In a best-case scenario for the
Kremlin, Russia ends up controlling swaths of eastern Ukraine, including
a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, allowing Russian forces to
continue threatening Ukraine's Black Sea coastline and the country's
center. Yet even this state of play would hardly improve the Kremlin's
hand compared to what it was before the February invasion, when Russia
already occupied Crimea and had the Ukrainians tied down in a low-level
war in the eastern part of the country. Strategically speaking, the
status quo ante was favorable to Russia, since the simmering conflict
was draining Ukraine's scarce resources and hobbling its aspirations to
join the EU and NATO. Germany and France, signatories to the stalled
Minsk peace process, were uninterested in inflaming tensions with Russia
over Ukraine---as was the United States. After taking office, President
Biden tried to patch up relations with Moscow so that he could focus on
his main foreign policy priority, China. Biden held a summit with Putin,
refused to give Ukraine any clearer guidance on NATO membership, and
ignored calls to sanction Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In the leadup
to the attack, Putin, the eternal tactician, may have been under the
impression that he was on a roll in Russia's "near abroad." In 2020,
when mass protests broke out in Belarus, wedged between Poland, the
Baltic region, and Russia, Putin offered dictator Alexander Lukashenko
financial support and riot police. After a flare-up in a bitter
territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that same year, the
Kremlin inserted itself into the fight by dispatching Russian
peacekeepers to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. In January the
Kremlin briefly deployed a Russian rapid-reaction force to Kazakhstan to
help a friendly regime shore up its authority amid antigovernment
demonstrations and violence. Though all are dependent on Russia, none of
the beneficiaries of recent Kremlin support has returned the favor by
actively backing the war against Ukraine. [Russia's Isolation To varying
degrees, Putin's attack on Ukraine sent shocks through every former
Soviet republic as Russia showed itself to be an unpredictable,
revanchist power. Russia's isolation in its own neighborhood has nothing
to do with NATO; its lack of true allies is a strategic disaster
entirely of Putin's own making. In light of their history as Soviet
vassals, the desire of former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO was
understandable and, in view of what's happening in Ukraine, completely
sensible]{.underline}. On emerging from behind the Iron Curtain three
decades ago, these countries didn't have the luxury to wait and see
whether their former overlord would first develop into a peace-loving,
democratic neighbor. That the Russian establishment even before Putin
was opposed to NATO expansion is also understandable, given Russia's
past domination over Central and Eastern Europe. The irony is that NATO
membership for the region's small, insecure nations made Russia's
western border the most stable it has ever been. Although Putin
fulminated about U.S. missile defense installations in Romania and
Poland, it was unclear how they were supposed to neutralize Russia's
vast nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. In fact[, before Russia
launched its first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States was
drawing down its military presence in Europe and attempting to pivot to
Asia. The case of Ukraine is the most egregious example of how Russia's
postimperial phantom pains have clouded the Kremlin's strategic
thinking]{.underline}. Ukraine, with its close cultural, linguistic,
economic, and religious ties to Russia, should have been a natural ally.
While most Ukrainians were proud of their distinct identity, they were
generally well-disposed toward Russia and deeply ambivalent about NATO
before 2014. The Alliance itself was divided over Ukraine's membership
precisely because of the country's deep connections to Russia. Even as
Putin's attack on Ukraine eight years ago spurred the United States,
Britain, Canada, and Germany to send troops to NATO allies in Eastern
Europe, it did not solidify support for Ukrainian membership within the
Alliance. When Putin ordered a full-scale invasion in February, Ukraine
was not significantly closer to joining NATO than it had been in 2008,
when the issue was hotly debated, together with Putin, at the annual
NATO summit. What has changed since 2014 is that a majority of
Ukrainians support NATO membership and have no doubts that Russia has
become their mortal enemy. As for NATO, member states such as the United
States and Britain began arming and training the Ukrainian military.
[Putin's fears of an increased U.S. presence in Ukraine---and Eastern
Europe more broadly---became a self-fulfilling prophesy. The
reputational damage to Russia that Putin's belligerence has caused is
staggering. Finland and Sweden are considering NATO membership, and even
Switzerland has ended its traditional neutrality and adopted EU
sanctions against Russia. Germany, once Russia's most faithful partner
in Western Europe, is determined to stop relying on Siberian natural
gas, ending an energy relationship that began during the Cold War. Trust
and economic synergies that took decades to build have been sacrificed
for Putin's delusional war. The Kremlin may retort that it has friends
in other parts of the world. But even in the United Nations, Russia has
been ostracized, with a large majority of countries calling on Moscow to
end its offensive in Ukraine. Putin received explicit support only from
Belarus, Syria, Eritrea, and North Korea, with China and India
abstaining. The isolation of Putin's Russia is linked to the country's
inability to articulate an attractive message about what it stands for
beyond being the self-proclaimed antipode to the United
States.]{.underline} At least during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
the bearer of a powerful ideology that found adherents around the world.
During his two decades in power, Putin has squandered the possibilities
of Russian soft power. With a tiny fraction of Russia's oil windfall, he
could have established a global network of institutes, like Germany's
Goethe-Institut or Spain's Instituto Cervantes, to tap into widespread
interest in Russian culture. Instead he focused on Russian hard power,
turning the Soviet Union's victory in World War II into the regime's
ideological foundation. The untold human sacrifice in World War II was
the source of the Soviet Union's legitimacy as a UN Security Council
member and worthy rival to the United States. [With his unprovoked war
against Ukraine, Putin has surrendered the last piece of moral high
ground Russia, as the successor state of the Soviet Union, held as a
leading member of the coalition that defeated Hitler. Putin's savage
attack on Ukraine will taint and overshadow the memory of Russian
heroism in World War II for generations to come.]{.underline} In May
2005, leaders from more than fifty countries, including the United
States and Ukraine, attended the Victory Day celebrations marking the
sixtieth anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat. The number of foreign
guests has since decreased inversely to Putin's mounting aggression.
Last year, only the leader of Tajikistan paid Putin the honor of
attending his parade. This May 9, in a striking symbol of Russia's
isolation, no foreign guests came at all.

"[Turkey is a NATO ally and will remain one. The war between our two
partners Russia and Ukraine has created a new understanding in favor of
strengthening procurement ties with our NATO allies," a presidential
aide told Defense News, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss
Ankara's diplomatic tightrope walk]{.underline}. The war has once again
put Turkey in a pivotal broker position within NATO. Ankara has
cultivated ties with both Russia and Ukraine that officials hope will
provide dividends in future negotiations. Turkey's approval is also
needed to advance Sweden's and Finland's respective NATO membership
applications, which grew out of their fear that Russia would work to
permanently isolate them from the alliance. But there is some history to
overcome. In 2020, Turkey paid \$2.5 billion for the Russian S-400 air
defense system. But fearing further isolation and sanctions from its
allies, Turkey decided against making the system operational. In
response to the acquisition, the U.S. suspended Turkey's membership in
the multinational consortium that builds the fifth-generation F-35
fighter jet. Turkey's down payment of \$1.5 billion for a first batch of
the stealth aircraft, which Ankara never received, remains to be
reimbursed. In March of this year, a senior Turkish diplomat who deals
with NATO and security affairs told Defense News that the
Russo-Ukrainian war has practically killed all potential Turkish-Russian
deals related to strategic weapon systems. [With Russia off the table as
a military supplier, Turkish leaders are back to surveying the Western
market]{.underline}. A senior Turkish procurement official said earlier
this spring that the Eurofighter Typhoon is one option, involving the
sale of about 80 aircraft --- a purchase that would give Turkish
industry an edge as it builds the country's indigenous fighter jet in
the making, the TF-X. The Typhoon was originally designed as an air
superiority fighter. It is manufactured by a consortium made up of
Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, which conducts the majority of the
aircraft project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter
Jagdflugzeug GmbH. The NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency,
representing the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain, manages the project and
is the prime customer. Turkey also has moved to acquire 40 F-16 Block 70
aircraft and upgrade kits for its 80 older F-16s. The Turkish request
went to Congress in April. Earlier in May, the Biden administration
asked the House of Representatives to approve the upgrade of Turkey's
F-16 fighter jet fleet. A potential deal may include high-tech missiles,
radar systems and electronic warfare suites for the planes. In addition,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n expressed hope in March that the
trilateral talks between Turkey, France and Italy to co-produce the
European air and anti-missile defense system SAMP/T, built by Eurosam,
would resume after the French elections in April. In similar optimism,
Foreign Minister Mevl칲t 칂avu릂륿u said in late March that Italy and
France were thinking "more seriously" now on co-producing the SAMP/T
systems in Turkey. [Meanwhile, Britain took steps to ease Turkey's
return to the Western procurement system. Turkish Deputy Foreign
Minister Faruk Kaymakc캼 said in February that Britain had lifted a ban
on arms sales to Turkey, imposed after a unilateral Turkish offensive in
northern Syria in 2019. The ease in trade restrictions was kept secret
from the public, and some observers say Canada might follow
suit]{.underline}. But most Western restrictions remain in effect. For
instance, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain
and Sweden imposed full arms embargoes on Turkey since 2019 over its
military interventions in Syria. France has placed restrictions on an
array of defense and aviation subsystems, and Italy has barred the sale
of certain products. Germany has suspended plans to sell engines to
power the Altay, Turkey's first indigenous main battle tank in the
making. "[Turkey's careful balancing act between its NATO allies and
Russia has generally been recognized in the West, sometimes with much
praise. How Turkey will maneuver between clashing Western and Russian
interests in the near future will shape Western appetite for Turkey's
return to their procurement system]{.underline}," said Ozgur Eksi, a
defense analyst in Ankara. Some Western diplomats think Erdo르n may try
to use Turkey's veto power in NATO for a reset in procurement ties with
the West. He said May 13 that his country is "not favorable" toward
Finland and Sweden joining the alliance, indicating Turkey could use its
membership to veto moves to admit the two countries. The issue was
unresolved at press time. "The Turks appear to be preparing for a tough
bargaining process, which may include the transfer of certain weapons
system," said a U.S. diplomat in Ankara. Russia's aggression in Ukraine
prompted Finland and Sweden to reconsider their traditions of military
nonalignment. Eksi said that because of the war in Ukraine, Turkey would
unlikely consider touching major arms deal with Russia that were
previously on the table. "That includes any Turkish intention to buy the
Russian-made Su-35 or Su-57 aircraft," he said. Erdo르n has previously
said Turkey was interested in buying the Russian-made fighter jets.

process initiated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and **delayed by
Turkey**---home to the second-largest military in the Alliance, after
the United States---which argued that the Nordic countries did not
sufficiently address Turkey's national-security concerns.]{.underline}

a breakthrough trilateral declaration on Tuesday. Atlantic Council IN

and the trilateral declaration. Jump to an expert reaction Mehmet Fatih

recognizes NATO brings far more geopolitical value than
Russia**]{.underline} Rich Outzen: The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[A victory for NATO unity and
cohesion]{.underline}** The ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine since
2014 has entirely changed the security landscape, not only in the
Euro-Atlantic area, but globally. It has fundamentally altered threat
perceptions beyond the Alliance, leading Finland and Sweden to
officially apply for membership in NATO. These two countries have indeed
crossed the Rubicon and deserted their neutrality in response to
persistent Russian belligerence in the middle of Europe. Their decision
to combine their efforts and assets with the Alliance against Russian
aggression is natural and legitimate. Hence the need to incorporate
Finland and Sweden into the Alliance family. The trilateral memorandum
signed among Turkey, Finland, and Sweden on June 28 is a welcome
development designed to demonstrate NATO's solidarity and unity, and
further strengthen the Alliance. [It is commonplace in NATO to consult
on and negotiate over any dispute among allies and would-be allies to
find a common ground. That is how NATO plays its role, and at the end a
solution accommodating such concerns is found by consensus.]{.underline}
It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.
[The newly adopted **Strategic Concept (SC) clearly** **identifies
Russia** and "terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations" as the
primary sources of threats]{.underline} in a 360-degree manner and
across all three core tasks of NATO: collective deterrence and defense,
crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. Given that
terrorism is "the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our
citizens and to international peace and prosperity," as defined in the
SC, it makes sense both for Finland and Sweden to cooperate with Turkey
in combatting terrorism as one of the primary sources of threats against
Alliance interests. In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense
against actual and potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and
expanding the web of networks with partners under challenging
circumstances are the main tasks of NATO in the next decade. The main
center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and cohesion,
including all allies and those set to become allies. The summit
decisions in their entirety will help NATO to navigate the troubled
waters ahead over the long term. ---Mehmet Fatih Ceylan is the president
of Ankara Policy Center and previously served as permanent
representative of Turkey to NATO. [Erdogan recognizes NATO brings far
more geopolitical value than Russia At their summit in Madrid, NATO
leaders decided to "invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO,
and agreed to sign the accession protocols."]{.underline} This was an
important breakthrough. Until now, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan had held up the protocols on the grounds that the two Nordic
nations had embargoed his nation from defense sales and refused to
extradite alleged Kurdish terrorists. Consensus was facilitated by a
meeting between US President Joe Biden and Erdogan---a bilateral long
sought by the Turkish leader---and memorialized via a trilateral
Turkey-Sweden-Finland memorandum in which the latter two agreed to lift
the embargoes, condemn the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist
organization, "address" Turkey's pending extradition requests, and
support Turkey's involvement in European Union defense initiatives. The
breakthrough underscored the influence and leadership of the United
States in NATO. There is no way Erdogan would have lifted his veto
solely due to European pressure. [It also reflects Erdogan's recognition
that NATO brings Turkey far more geopolitical value than Russia, which
would savor seeing this Nordic bid for NATO membership fail. Consensus
on Finland and Sweden's applications also demonstrated **the Alliance's
unity in the face of Russia's aggression** and the difficulty Moscow
still has when it comes to fully peeling Erdogan away from the
transatlantic community.]{.underline} Once again, Putin's strongest
relationship in the Black Sea region has proven to be far more
transactional than strategic. With that said, Turkey, like all the other
NATO allies, still has to ratify these accession protocols. There
remains ample opportunity for Erdogan to introduce additional
negotiations with the rest of NATO. I am optimistic that Sweden and
Finland will become NATO members, but it is still too early to say this
round of NATO enlargement is a done deal. ---Ian Brzezinski is a senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security and previously served as US deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Europe and NATO policy. The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[The summit was a great success for
Ankara]{.underline}** for three distinct reasons. The first is the
content of the trilateral memorandum signed with Sweden and Finland: No
arms embargo on Turkey, an affirmed commitment to address Turkish
security concerns, no aid to the PKK or (significantly) the Kurdish
People's Defense Units (YPG), the Gulen movement mentioned as a terror
concern, collaboration on the defense industry, working groups to
follow---it's hard to see what they missed. Of course, these are
statements of principle, and execution or a final commitment will play
out over time. But that is as true for Ankara approving accession as it
is for the specified cooperation. The second reason is the ringing
endorsement from the White House not only for the trilateral memorandum,
but for the strengthening of Turkish air power and specifically a
commitment to press Congress to approve F-16 fighter jet sales and
upgrades. Notably, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has already weighed in
with a strong endorsement of the deal. The in-person meeting of
presidents Biden and Erdogan was notable, too. The third reason is more
subtle: the inclusion in the new, slimmed-down Strategic Concept of
language on countering terrorism "in all its forms and manifestations."
[This language, and the prominence given both terror concerns and the
Russian military threat, address Turkish concerns and highlight **the
value Turkey adds to the Alliance.**]{.underline}

Turkey's location near several global hotspots has made the continuing
availability of its territory for the stationing and transport of arms,
cargo, and personnel valuable for the United States and NATO. [In
addition to Incirlik Air Base near the southern Turkish city of Adana,
other key U.S./NATO sites include an early warning missile defense radar
in eastern Turkey and a NATO ground forces command in Izmir]{.underline}
(see Figure A-3). From Turkey's perspective, [**NATO's traditional
importance has been to mitigate Turkish concerns** about encroachment by
neighbors, as was the case with the Soviet Union's aggressive post-World
War II posturing.]{.underline} Some similar Turkish concerns---though
somewhat less pronounced---may stem from Russia's ongoing regional
involvement in places such as Syria and Ukraine, and may partly motivate
recent Turkish military operations to frustrate some Russian objectives
in various conflict arenas.86 As a result of growing tensions between
Turkey and Western countries, and questions about the safety and utility
of Turkish territory for U.S. and NATO assets, some observers have
advocated exploring alternative basing arrangements in the region.87
Some reports suggest that expanded or potentially expanded U.S. military
presences in places such as Greece, Cyprus, Jordan and Romania might be
connected with concerns about Turkey.88 Additionally, Turkish actions in
opposition to the interests of other U.S. allies and partners in the
Eastern Mediterranean (see "Cyprus, Greece, and Eastern Mediterranean
Natural Gas" below)--- particularly over the past two years---have led
U.S. officials to encourage cooperation among those allies and
partners.89 In 2020, the Trump Administration waived restrictions on the
U.S. sale of non-lethal defense articles and services to the Republic of
Cyprus, effectively ending a U.S. arms embargo that had dated back to
1987, and attracting criticism from Turkish officials.90 [Turkey's
influence in the Black Sea littoral region and its relationships with
European countries bordering Russia make **its actions in this sphere
important for U.S. interests**.]{.underline} Ongoing Turkish defense
cooperation with or arms sales to Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, and
Azerbaijan may present opportunities to make renewed common cause
between the United States and Turkey to counter Russia.91 Alternatively,
Turkey's interactions with these other countries could possibly check
both U.S. and Russian ambitions, or increase regional tensions
potentially leading toward conflict.92 A case in point will be how
Turkey regulates and controls other countries' maritime access to and
from the Black Sea---a limited privilege granted to Turkey in the
Montreux Convention of 1936 (with provisions to give Turkey greater
control when at war).93

Turks are rightly proud of the success of Bayraktar drones in the
conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine has also celebrated the success of
Bayraktar drones against Russian armour, particularly in turning the
tide in the first few weeks in the Battle of Kyiv -- with songs even
produced and sung by Ukrainians soldiers to acclaim the battlefield
changing nature of this high-end Turkish technology. [Turks like to view
this as a great example of the country's **new-found technological and
military prowess**, but also their willingness to show support for
Ukraine despite obvious risks to damaging valuable relations with
Russia. Ukrainians are, though, beginning to **doubt Turkey's commitment
to their cause**,]{.underline} notwithstanding the undoubted success of
Bayraktar. [Turkey's stance on peace talks]{.underline} in Antalya in
March and again over trying to broker a deal to break the grain blockade
of Ukrainian ports [has **left a distinct impression in Kyiv that Ankara
is too keen to toe the Russian line** and force a Russian friendly peace
deal down their throats.]{.underline} In Antalya [the Turkish side were
confident a deal was to be done, and even sold a deal as in the offing,
but this **seemed to be close to terms being offered by
Moscow**]{.underline}, with little effort to accept or even understand
the Ukrainian position. Predictably the Antalya peace process eventually
collapsed. The fact that Ankara seems tone deaf to Ukraine's position
was also evident on talks on-going over breaking the grain blockade,
with Ankara negotiating directly with Moscow and seemingly little effort
being made to involve the Ukrainian side -- even though any plan
involves decisions about unblocking Ukrainian ports. On the ports issue,
[Turkey seemed unable to comprehend the Ukrainian position that getting
agreement to de-mine ports was worthless unless there were also security
guarantees to ensure that Russian forces did not use this as an
opportunity]{.underline} to launch amphibious landings against Odesa,
Mikolaiv, et al. Turkey appeared na칦ve in both the Antalya talks and the
talks over ending the grain blockade. The Turkish side appeared to be
adopting a peace deal at any (to Ukraine) cost strategy, but with zero
effort to understand the Ukrainian position. But key to understanding
the Turkish position on the war in Ukraine, and its seemingly blinkered
effort to bring peace at almost any cost (to Ukraine), is that [the
Erdogan administration views all of this through **its very narrow
electoral lens**.]{.underline} And therein it faces difficult elections
within the next year, with opinion polls not looking good for either
Erdogan or his ruling AKP, while the economy is in a desperately weak
position. [A degree of desperation and wishful thinking is hence evident
in Turkey's approach to the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} On the latter,
[over the past decade, under Erdogan's failed monetary policy mantra
that "high interest rates cause inflation," the economy has been in an
almost constant state of balance of payments crisis. Erdogan continually
prioritises growth over inflation and exchange rate
stability]{.underline}, as in the past credit growth has delivered real
GDP growth, jobs and votes. But this has meant the economy has been run
too hot, the price of which has been wide current account deficits,
large external financing requirements and constant pressure on the lira
to weaken. An orthodox response would be to tighten monetary and/or
fiscal policy to slow domestic demand, lower import demand and with it
the trade and current account deficits, thereby alleviating pressure on
the lira. But Erdogan's interest rate ideology has removed this option
for the CBRT, meaning that the lira has had to take the strain, which
has in turn fuelled inflation. Turks are unhappy with inflation and a
constantly weakening lira. They feel poorer, which explains Erdogan's
lowly popularity. But [**Erdogan still thinks he can win the election**
by pulling a few more rabbits out of the hat]{.underline} -- including
the recent exchange rate protected deposit scheme, and more recently
restrictions on corporates borrowing in lira if they have large FX
deposits. Erdogan thinks that this can buy him some time, helping slow
dollarisation, anchor the lira enough for him to push the growth agenda
just one more time to win the next election. In normal times it would be
touch and go whether this strategy could hold things stable enough to
get through to elections by June 2023 and deliver Erdogan a win. But
[the war in Ukraine has just made the maths here even more difficult --
higher energy and food import costs and the threat of the loss of key
Ukrainian and Russian tourism receipts (one quarter of the total) are
pushing the current account deficit wider and putting even more pressure
on the lira.]{.underline} Erdogan needs this war to end and soon,
otherwise he risks getting rolled over in an extreme balance of payments
crisis which would scupper any remaining popularity he has. So, Erdogan
has been happy to allow Bayraktar drones to go to Ukraine -- they
advertise Turkish engineering prowess and generate important export
earnings. But beyond that Turkey has done little to help Ukraine's
cause. And, as noted, if anything the Antalya peace talks and the talks
over unblocking grain deliveries from Ukraine have undermined Kyiv's
position. Turkey has also failed to join Western sanctions on Russia --
arguing that it simply cannot afford to, given its challenging balance
of payments position. **[If relations with the West were better, it
might have hoped for financial support to offset losses from sanctions
and the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}** But this option is constrained by
broader Western concern about policy choices made by Erdogan, including
over monetary policy. Some close to the Erdogan administration have even
argued that Turkey could benefit from sanctions by acting as a
middle-man similar to its position on Iranian sanctions. Some think that
Turkey could benefit as Russian companies look to reflag to avoid
sanctions, as Russian capital and business look to exit and evade
sanctions, and also by being a conduit for Russian capital -- tourism,
the latter being the scenario where Russians seek to holiday in Turkey
but using this as an opportunity to park capital by opening Turkish bank
accounts and buying property. To some extent facilitating capital flight
from Russia is a benefit for the West in heaping the economic pressure
on Russia, but there is a fine dividing line for Turkey here from being
seen to profit from the conflict, and concern that some of the activity
might be on the edge of actual sanctions breaking. A recent visit by US
Treasury officials to Turkey likely was meant to draw clear lines as to
what is and is not acceptable. And then there is the whole furore around
Turkey's stalling on Finland and Sweden's bid to join Nato. As Nato
allies have highlighted, [Turkey does have understandable security
concerns over Scandinavian support for various Kurdish groups. It has
leverage now to force Sweden and Finland to rein these in. And playing
hardball on this issue **will play very well with the domestic
nationalist constituency** in Turkey before elections.]{.underline}
It\'s potentially a win-win for Turkey. But the risk is that Erdogan
overplays his hand and permanently damages relations with the West. He
needs to realise that for the US and the rest of its Nato allies, Russia
is the priority and is seen as a clear and present danger, and an
existential threat to Ukraine and the West. Finnish and Swedish Nato
entry is a huge win for the West, for Ukraine, and a major snub to
Putin. If Erdogan now blocks this at the Nato summit in Madrid later
this month, relations with the West will, I think, be permanently
soured. And likely the West will adopt an openly hostile, as opposed to
largely neutral, approach to Erdogan's re-election by June 2023.
Blocking Swedish and Finnish membership would also stall rising hopes of
a deal over Turkey's compensation for leaving the F35 project, through
purchase of additional F16s and upgrade kits. This would damage Turkey's
defence capability. Now [playing hardball to the end of this could turn
the next election in Erdogan's favour, and I think he will have to
balance this off against the risk of a major balance of payments crisis
if he plays hardball too long]{.underline}. And with the West angered,
he would have few tools to allay any such BOP crisis -- he does not want
to hike policy rates or go to the IMF, capital controls are
counterproductive and will damage business, the CBRT has limited
reserves and FX adjustment just leads to more inflation. If he faces a
BOP crisis after vetoing Finnish and Swedish Nato membership, I think
the West would stand on the sidelines as a full balance of payments
crisis washes over Erdogan. And likely Erdogan would lose the next
election. Logic would suggest that Erdogan would play very hardball to
the Madrid summit -- get deals over Kurdish groups in Sweden and
Finland, easing of arms sanctions, and new agreements over new arms
purchases like the F16. He can tell electors at home that he played
hardball and won concessions. He will hope the West is grateful enough
to keep capital markets open to allow him to finance his external
borrowing needs. All this feels pretty binary. But I think in all this,
[Erdogan needs to realise that for the West **the crisis in Ukraine is a
defining moment**]{.underline}, a definitive challenge they face, and
it's a time to ask if allies are with the West or against it. [Erdogan
**has tried staying on the fence**, to some extent trying to play one
side off against the other.]{.underline} I think time for such an
approach is fast running out. Madrid will likely be the moment when
Erdogan has to decide whose side he is on. An important week is in store
for Nato and Turkey.

[**The Turkish government has designated the Russian invasion as a
"war,"** giving it the right under the 1936 Montreux Convention to close
the Bosporus Strait---which leads to the Black Sea---to
warships.]{.underline} Although this action applies to any naval vessel,
it is clearly aimed at Russia's fleet in case Moscow seeks to reinforce

Russian submarine sails in the Bosporus on its way to the Black Sea.
Despite the restrictions on warships in the Bosporus, it seems clear
that Turkey---like other countries including Israel---has sought a
strategically defensible but morally questionable middle ground. Though
[Turkey voted for a UN General Assembly resolution condemning
Russia]{.underline}, it has not sanctioned Russia or closed its airspace
to Russian aircraft. Some observers have been quick to highlight the
differences between Turkish policy and the definitive pro-Ukraine
approaches of the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), implying that [Ankara is trying to have it both
ways---remaining rhetorically committed to Ukraine's independence and
offering to mediate the conflict while tilting toward Russia. There is
some logic to this, especially after the purchase of the Russian-made
air defense system known as the S-400. However, it is less a tilt than a
recognition that **Turkey's interests are intertwined with Russia in
critical areas**, most importantly Syria.]{.underline} There, Turkey
wants to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state and maintain pressure
on the People's Protection Units (YPG), a group linked to the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), which the United States and Turkey have designated
a terrorist organization. To accomplish these goals, Turkish officials
have to consider Russian sensibilities, as Moscow is the most important
external actor in Syria and can thus complicate Turkey's military
operations there and frustrate its diplomatic efforts. In recent years,
Turkey has pursued what can best be described as foreign policy
independence. As an important power in the Mediterranean, the Middle
East, and the Caucusus, Ankara has sought a multifaceted foreign policy
that has, at times, conflicted with its NATO allies. For example, in
2017, Turkey decided to purchase S-400s. This step coincided with a
growing dialogue between Ankara and Moscow that included moves to
upgrade economic ties and discussions about deepening diplomatic and
even military relations. At the same time, Turkey and Russia have found
themselves on opposite ends of major regional conflicts, including in
Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region over which Armenia and
Azerbaijan fought a recent war. Even while they were supporting
different sides in these places, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
and Russian President Vladimir Putin maintained a dialogue. What about
Ukraine? [**Turkey has generally supported Ukrainian independence and
the country's territorial integrity.** Erdogan denounced Russia's 2014
annexation of Crimea and has advocated on behalf of Crimean Tatars (a
Turkic ethnic group) who have suffered under Russian rule. Turkey sold
armed drones to Ukraine ahead of Russia's most recent invasion, though
some reports indicate that only about twelve to twenty were
delivered.]{.underline} Still, in whatever number, Turkish Bayraktar TB2
drones are lethal and have been deployed to great effect in Libya,
Syria, and Nagorno-Karabakh. How is this war likely to affect Turkey's
interests in the region? [**Turkey has sought to expand its trade and
commercial relations with**]{.underline} both Russia and
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. It is also a destination for Russian tourists
and an importer of oil and gas. To the extent that this war affects
these ties and drives up energy prices, the Turkish economy---which is
already experiencing upwards of 50 percent inflation---will feel the
repercussions.

### 2AC -- No Link--NATO Over Russia

#### Even *if* Turkey and Russia [are]{.underline} tied together, Russia will [never]{.underline} replace NATO in Turkey's eyes

Between Turkey and Russia Feasible at the Expense of Turkey's Relations

The article mainly contends that since the real and expected benefits
from the European Union (EU) and NATO were not delivered sufficiently
from Turkey's perspective, Turkey looked for alternatives and
collaborated with Russia more intensely in recent years. Turkey's
cooperation with Russia was also facilitated by several global,
political, economic, conjectural, security-related, and individual-level
factors. Another argument of the study is that [despite Turkey's
intensive collaboration with Russia**, it is not feasible for Turkey to
build a strategic partnership with it in the short- and medium-term at
the expense of its relations with NATO** and the EU.]{.underline} The
main reasons for this are, in addition to the institutional and social
shortcomings, geostrategic divergences, [Russia's inadequacy as an
economic actor, the pitfalls of an asymmetric relationship with Russia,
the security risks posed by Russia, NATO's continuing importance for
Turkey's security needs, and the incompatibility of Russia's and
Turkey's political systems.]{.underline} Keywords: EU; NATO; Russia;
strategic partnership; Turkish foreign policy Introduction The arrival
of the Russian S-400 air defence system in Turkey in July 2019 was
welcomed enthusiastically by many in Turkey. This breakthrough event was
even described by some in Turkey as the "country's liberation from the
West" (Tol and Ta릃캼nar 2019, 107). Almost a decade ago, the question
started to be asked as to whether Turkey was drifting away from the
West, especially since it had approached Iran and voted against
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme in the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) as well as clashed with Israel over the Mavi
Marmara incident in 2010. This time, however, this question is more
pronounced and the likelihood of a strategic shift became more tangible
with the arrival of a weapon system from a country that has been
confronting the West recently. Given that Turkey's relations with the
United States and the European Union (EU) have been at a nadir in recent
years, many regarded the acquisition of the Russian weapon system as a
precursor of Turkey's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Alliance (North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO) and the EU. In addition to many
other factors, Moscow's and Ankara's bitter relations with the West are
a major reason why the two countries have closed ranks in recent years.
A milestone for Moscow's relationship with the West was its annexation
of Crimea in March 2014 while the coup plot against the Justice and
Development Party (Adalet ve Kalk캼nma Partisi, AKP) government in Turkey
in July 2016 marked a watershed in Ankara's relations with the West.
Russia had to confront a series of economic sanctions from the West
after 2014 while Turkey was deeply disappointed with its Western allies
for their slow and reluctant condemnation of the coup attempt. Ankara
has even aired doubts that the West might have been behind the coup
attempt. These events have helped peak the two countries'
deeply-ingrained sense of distrust towards the West. As one observer
put, "Despite their obvious differences and even antagonisms, Russia and
Turkey are united by one thing---the fact that they are two great powers
connected historically, culturally, and geographically to a Europe that
never fully accepted them as one of their own" (Lukyanov, People with
Big Ambitions, The Moscow Times, 19 July 2016). A major objective of
this article is to unpack the puzzle of whether Russia could replace the
EU and NATO as a strategic partner for Turkey. The article contends that
in addition to some factors facilitating the Russo--Turkish
rapprochement, Turkey searched for alternatives, collaborating with
Russia owing to the decline in the real and expected benefits from the
EU and NATO from the Turkish perspective. Another major contention of
this article is that despite the close collaboration between Moscow and
Ankara, in particular after the coup attempt against the Turkish
Government in July 2016, [**it is hard for Turkey to forge a strategic
partnership with Russia** because of significant divergent geostrategic
interests, Russia's inadequacy as an economic actor, the downsides of an
asymmetric relationship with Russia, the security risks posed by Russia,
the continuing importance of NATO for Turkey's security as well as the
incompatibility of Turkey's and Russia's political systems. Moreover,
**the absence of a solid social basis and the lack of
institutionalization in their relations further make it infeasible for
Turkey to switch** from the Transatlantic Alliance to
Russia.]{.underline} The study is divided into three sections. The first
part concerns the motives that brought Moscow and Ankara together,
including, first and foremost, their strained relationship with the
West, economic interests, conjectural factors such as the Syrian
conflict, transformation of the global governance system, and similarity
of their political culture based on security and personal harmony
between the leaders. [The second part draws attention to the limitations
in the relationship]{.underline}, and the third part explains why [a
strategic partnership between Turkey and Ankara and at the expense of
Turkey's partnership with the EU and NATO **is not feasible in the
foreseeable future.**]{.underline} Finally, the conclusion wraps up the
article.

### 2AC -- No Link--Turkey Does Both

#### Turkey [can]{.underline} work with both sides

<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/turkeys-goals-russia-ukraine-war>//RM)

Of the many countries struggling to find a proper approach to the
Russia-Ukraine war, Turkey seems to have landed on the most
controversial yet comfortable one. [Ankara has managed to preserve its
relationship with both Moscow and Kyiv without endangering its own
geostrategic calculations in the region while at the same time avoiding
joining ranks with Western countries in imposing crippling sanctions on
Russia. The role of a key mediator, which President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n
was so eager to take on, has allowed Turkey to conveniently position
itself in the middle of the fight---and not just in the conflict between
Russia and Ukraine but more broadly in the struggle between Russia and
the West, and even globally between the West and the numerous
non-Western countries that have preferred to strike a more cautious and
balanced approach to the war.]{.underline} The overall political and
ideological polarization incited by the war in Ukraine has threatened
many countries that have worked for years to build a balanced,
pragmatic, multivector foreign policy. Now many of them find themselves
having to make a hard choice. Western countries under U.S. guidance are
urging them to make common cause against Russia, which often means
abandoning their balancing act between major powers. As the war has
shown, in a highly tense international environment, a posture of
neutrality and balancing on the part of countries struggling not to
choose sides is not welcome by the conflicting parties, which strive to
mobilize support for their own efforts. [Turkey in particular has had to
carve a path that does not lethally threaten relations with either
Russia or the EU.]{.underline} The war in Ukraine has presented Ankara
with both opportunities and risks. After the 2015 centralization of
political power in the hands of Recep Erdo르n, the president moved his
personal ambitions and goals to the forefront of Turkey's foreign
policy. In particular, he has sought to make Turkey a regional Muslim
superpower capable of designing and guiding a new "post-Western"
security architecture in greater Eurasia and one of the first
non-Western powers to shape the new multipolar world order. [To preserve
this course, Turkey has had to find an appropriate way to deal with the
Ukraine challenge. In essence, two global objectives became a priority
for Turkey when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24: to preserve its
global and regional positions, which Turkey has managed to consolidate
and enhance after 2016; as well as to reinforce Ankara's influence and
amplify earlier achievements to ensure further expansion.]{.underline}
Objective 1: Preserving Turkey's Global and Regional Positions The first
global objective is reflected in several developments that became
essential in Ankara's quest to hold its ground. First, the war in
Ukraine has threatened Turkey's pragmatic multipolar approach
underpinning its foreign policy. The political coalescence of NATO and
EU countries against Russia could not have escaped Turkey's attention.
Nor could Ankara remain on the sidelines and refrain from getting
involved, given its close ties with several Western countries and its
NATO commitments. On the other hand, Turkey did not want to degrade its
relations with Russia by joining the Western-led sanctions, in which
Ankara has declined to participate since 2014. For Turkey, Russia has
been an important trading partner (\$32.5 billion as of 2021), a key
source of foreign investment (more than \$10 billion), a colossal source
of tourists (Russians account for almost 5 million visits, or 1 percent
of all foreign tourist visitation), a crucial energy supplier, and an
important "frenemy" in several regional playgrounds where Turkey (though
not without Russia) has been able to actually accomplish something, such
as in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh. [Turkey has been able to
maintain relations with Russia and the West, thereby sustaining its
desired global position, by assuming the role of a key mediator between
Russia and Ukraine. This formal role gives Ankara a good reason not to
get involved in sanctioning Moscow.]{.underline} Second, the war in
Ukraine, with its subsequent social, economic, political, and
transnational repercussions, has endangered stability on a number of
regional issues that are vital for Turkey's security, reputation, and
international self-reliance. For years, Turkey's regional policy was
built on a situational partnership with Moscow. The possible weakening
of Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine could throw the regional
balance in the South Caucasus, the Black Sea region, and the Levant into
disarray, strengthening, for instance, Iran in Syria---and Iran is one
of Turkey's less preferred competitors. Regional destabilization is not
in Ankara's interests, especially in light of the substantial financial
and economic difficulties Turkey has been struggling with since last
autumn. Objective 2: Reinforcing Ankara's Influence The second global
objective has to do with furthering Turkey's political, economic, trade,
and geopolitical expansion. By shaping the dynamics of the current
crisis, Turkey is trying to "ride the tide" and use it to its advantage.
Its tactics to achieve this goal include taking the place of Western
companies on the Russian market, accruing tourist and financial flows
from Russia, thereby bypassing sanctions, and gaining political ground
in regional affairs by taking on a mediation role, forcing the
conflicting parties to consult with and through Ankara on issues of war,
peace, maritime trade, the demining of the Black Sea, and the
restoration of essential Ukrainian wheat exports. In addition, many
Russians, fearing Western sanctions, have moved to Turkey, investing
millions in the local real estate market and registering businesses
there, which is also a lucrative deal for Ankara. (Ankara offers
citizenship for a \$400,000 investment.) Finally, Turkey sees an
opportunity to achieve its long-sought goal of becoming the major gas
transit hub for Europe. With the European allies determined more than
ever to reduce their dependence on Russian gas imports, Turkey is
offering its services and lobbying for realization of a long-discussed
new subsea pipeline between Israel and Turkey, one that would allow
eastern Mediterranean gas to reach Europe through Turkey. Even more
important for Ankara in this context is exploiting the momentum to
strengthen its own standing in the world. As Western partners search for
support in containing the Russian threat and dealing with an array of
war-related consequences, Ankara sees the time is ripe to make the West
drop sanctions against the Turkish defense industry and embrace Turkey
as an equal partner. It is with this logic in mind that Turkey's
leadership unexpectedly jumped on NATO's expansion process with bold
demands as to what Sweden, Finland, and NATO member states should do to
obtain Ankara's consent. And it is this tactic of getting the most out
of concessions from all parties that drove Erdo르n to announce a new
military operation in northern Syria against the Western-backed Kurds,
thereby endangering the regional positions of both Russia and the United
States. All in all, Ankara's predominant stance on the Russia-Ukraine
war is not about Russia or Ukraine at all. It is about ensuring that any
future postwar settlement in the region and the world will necessarily
include Turkey's interests, and ideally establish Turkey as a
stakeholder in the process. Turkey's serious economic problems, however,
mean these plans may have to be adjusted. The key aspect of the
Russia-Ukraine war for Erdo르n and his government remains not so much
support for Ukraine or Russia as an opportunity for Erdo르n to
strengthen his position on the international stage at the expense of
either country's interests by proactively practicing diplomacy amid the
developing crisis.

[While discontent with the West and anti-Westernism have facilitated
cordial and cooperative relations between Moscow and Ankara, **Russian
geopolitical revisionism has almost invariably pushed Turkey closer to
the West.**]{.underline} The logic here is straightforward. First,
[Russian revisionism poses direct security threats to
Turkey.]{.underline} Historically, the centre of gravity of
Turkish-Russian rivalry has been the Black Sea. From the Turkish
perspective, [Russia's actions -- from the war in Georgia to annexation
of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine -- all decisively **tilt the
balance of power** in this region in Russia's favour.]{.underline}
Although Russia's policy in each of these cases might have specifics and
con춼textual nuances, taken together they point to one unmistakable
outcome: Russian revisionism in the post-Soviet space and an aspiration
to turn the region into a sphere of domination. This will only aggravate
the Turkish threat perception vis--vis Moscow. Second, the post-Soviet
space is also Tur춼key's immediate neighbourhood. If success춼ful, the
[Russian policy will restrict Ankara's geopolitical room for manoeuvre
in this region, and undermine its standing from the Black Sea to the
Balkans and the South Caucasus to Central Asia.]{.underline}
Additionally, [**Turk춼ish and Western interests are in broad align춼ment**
in these regions]{.underline}, so Moscow's geo춼political revisionism is
likely to bring Tur춼key and the West relatively closer together.

\[Rachel Ellehuus is deputy director and senior fellow with the Europe

Yet these foundational factors remain valid: [Turkey's geopolitical
position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa still provides
NATO with needed political and operational reach]{.underline}, and
Turkey continues to benefit from the collective military power of NATO.
With the relationship close to (if not at) its nadir, Turkey and NATO,
with the support of the EU, need to take active measures to anchor it
for the future, while avoiding steps that could destroy the relationship
entirely. Assuming that Turkey is in fact interested in rebuilding the
relationship with its NATO allies, there are several active measures
NATO and Turkey can take now to create a foothold for the future[. The
key is to focus on areas of mutual interest where NATO involvement is
critical to Turkish strategic interests and where Turkey has a unique
role to play in NATO. The first of these is the Black Sea, where Turkey,
as well as fellow NATO Black Sea littoral states Romania and Bulgaria,
are trying to balance an increasing Russian military
presence.]{.underline} While previously resistant to a greater NATO role
in the Black Sea for fear it would dilute its own influence in the
region, [Turkey now sees the dangers of leaving Russian influence and
presence in \[the\] Black Sea unchecked.]{.underline} With its illegal
annexation of Crimea in 2014 and entry into the Syrian civil war in
2015, Russia has significantly increased its presence and combat
capabilities in both the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean. [NATO now
faces an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble that restricts allies'
freedom of maneuver in the Black Sea, with Russia capable of attacking
from both land and sea. To effectively counter this, NATO should
establish a more continuous presence in the Black Sea]{.underline},
revive the idea of a permanent NATO maritime fleet in the Black Sea, and
consider basing more counter-A2/AD capabilities in Turkey and Romania.
Importantly[, Turkey holds unique power to control access to the Black
Sea]{.underline} thanks to the 1936 Montreux Convention, which governs
naval passage through the Turkish Straits, limiting the number of
foreign vessels that can enter the Black Sea via the Straits and how
long these vessels can stay. This access is important to both Russia and
NATO. Whereas Turkey has proven to be an impartial and reliable enforcer
of the treaty, Russia has pushed the boundaries of Montreux repeatedly
since the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 and, more recently, impeded the
course of NATO vessels that have entered and departed the Black Sea in
compliance with the treaty. More behavior along these lines, or a
Russian attempt to leverage its new, closer relationship with Turkey to
secure more favorable access to the Black Sea, would likely increase
Turkey's unease and lead it to rely more on NATO as a counterbalance.
For its part, the European Union should closely watch Turkey's proposed
construction of the Istanbul Canal to connect the Black Sea to the Sea
of Marmara (and, as such, the Aegean and Mediterranean seas), which is
reportedly drawing interest from Chinese as well as Russian investors.
As the canal would allow ships to sail between the Mediterranean and
Black Sea without transiting the Turkish Straits, and thus abiding by
the restrictions of Montreux, the European Union and United States
should consider investing in this infrastructure project to ensure they
are in a position to work with Turkey to ensure free and fair transit
through the canal.

#### NATO and Turkey are [key]{.underline} to mitigating Middle Eastern conflict

In comparison with almost every other geographical region, [the Middle
East suffers from a lack of both regional dispute resolution mechanisms
and diplomatic protocols that might reduce the scope for regional
conflict]{.underline}. While the Cold War was defined by the antagonism
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, both sides increasingly felt the need
for inclusive institutions and mechanisms to reduce tensions. Every U.S.
president during the Cold War, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George H. W.
Bush, met with his Soviet counterpart. During the tensest moments,
high-level U.S.-Soviet channels of communications were especially
important. Over time, a number of confidence-building institutions and
transparency-enhancing measures were created, including the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), successive arms control
agreements, and later the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows for unarmed
surveillance flights over signatory countries to promote military and
nuclear weapons openness. In the Middle East, however, [the absence of
any similar mechanisms or organizations, particularly amid proliferating
military conflicts, feeds security dilemmas across multiple vectors, so
that steps justified by one state as necessary to its
security]{.underline}---military intervention, arms procurement,
alliance formation, and so on---are perceived by its rivals as
threatening. During the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts of the 1990s,
there were attempts to build mechanisms for regional communication and
cooperation. Participants at the 1991 Madrid Conference set up five
multilateral working groups to address regional challenges, each
involving Israel and a range of Arab states. The centerpiece was the
Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS) working group, which marked
the first bid to create a formal multilateral framework for regional
security issues. Six ACRS plenary sessions, co-hosted by the United
States and Russia, were held and a series of regional
confidence-building measures were outlined before the working group
slowly broke down by 1995 under the weight of regional animosities and
implementation challenges. While all of the working groups have long
been defunct, one tangible result survives: the Middle East Desalination
Research Center in Oman, created in 1995. The center conducts
transboundary water research and development projects, and its
membership includes Israel, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, and Qatar as well
as several Western nations.

But the critics do not stop there. There is the wider accusation of
Turkish unreliability. It should not be forgotten that [Turkey has been
a reliable member of NATO for the past seven decades. It **contributed
significantly to the Alliance's collective defence** and deterrence in
the Cold War.]{.underline} By tying up a large portion of Soviet troops
in its region, it considerably reduced the pressure on Central Europe.
Ironically, the Western European countries were able to build their
Union gradually in a secure and stable environment ensured by NATO, with
Turkey shouldering a heavy military burden. With the end of the Cold
War, alone among the existing allies, Turkey's security situation
worsened. Turkey found itself increasingly exposed in a region of
turmoil engulfed by several armed conflicts. The new and emerging
security risks, including terrorism, have impacted Turkey as much, if
not more, than any other Ally. Turkey feels itself on a new front line.
But throughout this period, [Turkey has **remained an island of
stability in a volatile region.** Even though instability and disorder
are on our doorstep, Turkey has fulfilled all its NATO obligations and
provided security and stability rather than consuming them.]{.underline}
Turkey has stood solid behind every key NATO decision. NATO invoked
Article V of the Treaty for the first time following the 9/11 terrorist
attacks against the U.S. Under the Taliban, Afghanistan had become a
haven for international terrorism. As a staunch ally, [Turkey has
**played a significant role in NATO's stabilization efforts in
Afghanistan.** It has deployed troops and other military assets in
harm's way alongside other allies and partners. Turkey has never
deviated from the NATO policy "in together-adjust together-out
together".]{.underline} Moreover, Turkey's especially close and
long-standing ties with Afghanistan has enabled the Alliance as a whole
to benefit from its knowledge, expertise and political weight in that
country. [Moreover, the fight against ISIS, a serious concern for the
whole world, **would not have been so successful without Turkey**'s
participation and assistance.]{.underline} Turkey has become an
essential partner in this struggle by joining the coalition against
ISIS. It made three air bases, including Incirlik, available for the
Allies, enabling decisively effective military operations. Elsewhere, in
the Balkans and Iraq, Turkey has contributed to NATO's stabilization
efforts. In terms of NATO's priority core task, collective defence,
successive governments in Turkey have never wavered in their commitment
to the Alliance. Turkey's current contribution cannot be overstated. [It
**currently hosts a range of NATO commands and and assets**, essential
to NATO's collective defence, including Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) in
Izmir and the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps (NRDC) in
Istanbul.]{.underline} Significantly, Turkey will be the lead nationin
2021 in command of the 'Spearhead Force' of NATO (VJTF). This force can
be deployed at short notice to any allied country considered under
threat.

[A second area where **Turkey's immediate security concerns intersect
with the majority of other NATO members** is stability in the Middle
East, most immediately in Syria]{.underline}. To be sure,
[Turkey's]{.underline} anger over United States' partnership with the
YPG in the fight against the Islamic State---[appnd NATO's]{.underline}
anger at Turkey for its unilateral incursion into northern Syria---will
make progress difficult. But ultimately, the two **[sides share a mutual
interest in seeing stability and pluralistic governance in
Syria.]{.underline}** This entails constraining Syrian president Bashar
al-Assad; preventing the return of the Islamic State and Europe-based
Islamic State fighters; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian
aid, reconstruction, and refugee return. More broadly, [both sides also
share an interest in limiting Russian and Iranian influence in the
region.]{.underline} With the Russian military presence in Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Crimea now supplemented by the Russian naval base at
Tartus, airbases at Kobani and Khmeimim, and helicopter base\[s\] at
Qamishli, Turkey is effectively encircled by Russia. It is in this
context that German minister of defence Kramp-Karrenbauer's suggestion
of [an internationally-controlled security zone along the Turkey-Syria
border, possibly NATO-led]{.underline} and backed by the United Nations
in loose partnership with Russia, makes sense. It [would address a
situation that immediately and directly affects the security of Europe
and Turkey and demonstrate that]{.underline} the **[NATO is invested in
addressing Turkey's security concerns]{.underline}**. Should NATO and
Turkey move to restore some level of trust by taking these first steps,
it will be important to avoid unnecessarily escalating tensions. For
Turkey, this means abiding by the terms of the Syria ceasefire, not
pursuing additional purchases of Russian military equipment, and doing
its part to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State in the region or
return of Islamic State foreign fighters to Europe. For the United
States and Europe, the trick will be to apply the required sanctions and
arms embargoes in a discriminate way. For example, whereas imposing
sanctions in accordance with the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and withholding delivery of Turkey's
F-35s due to its purchase of the Russian S-400 makes good policy sense,
imposing additional blanket sanctions could do more harm than good,
affecting the Turkish people more than their leadership and giving
Erdogan another opportunity to blame the West for Turkey's economic
problems. A smarter approach might involve going after corrupt actors
using the Global Magnitsky Act. Similarly, a total arms embargo by the
United States and the European Union will only drive Turkey to procure
more Russian or non-NATO interoperable military equipment. Rather, the
arms embargoes should be limited along the lines of the most recent
House sanctions bill, which includes exemptions for items to be used in
NATO-approved operations. Finally, as some of Turkey's biggest export
partners, the European Union and the United States can provide needed
carrots along the way to incentivize constructive behavior by Ankara.
[Measures might include an eventual upgrade of Turkey's customs union
with the European Union or limited visa-free travel to EU countries for
Turkish citizens.]{.underline} For the United States, President Trump's
offer of a \$100 billion trade deal will also be attractive to Erdogan
in Turkey's struggling economy. To be sure, repairing the trust that has
been lost and returning Turkey to the path of Western integration will
be a struggle, requiring sustained effort, and a setting aside of egos,
on all sides. Yet on this occasion of NATO's 70th anniversary, Turkey
and its NATO allies owe it to one another to pause for a moment and
reflect not on their many disagreements but on what brought them
together in the first instance and why that still matters.

[**Turkey failed to garner Russian and Iranian backing for a fresh
military intervention against Syrian Kurdish forces** at the meeting of
the Astana platform this week.]{.underline} Senior diplomats from
Turkey, Russia and Iran, the three guarantors of the platform, as well
as representatives of Syria's government and opposition, attended the
June 15-16 meeting in Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan, known previously
as Astana. While the official agenda included topics such as the return
of Syrian refugees, the humanitarian and economic situation in Syria,
the work of the constitutional committee in Geneva and
confidence-boosting measures toward a political settlement, [the **main
issue was Turkish threats** to wrestle control of further territory held
by the Kurds.]{.underline} President Recep Tayyip has openly named Tel
Rifaat and Manbij as targets, vowing to rid them of "terrorists" as part
of a plan to create a safe zone with a depth of 30 kilometers (about 20
miles) along the Turkish border. The groups in Ankara's crosshairs are
the People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the US-backed
Syrian Democratic Forces, and its political wing, the Democratic Union
Party. Ankara equates them with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the
armed outfit designated as a terrorist group over its decades-long
separatist campaign in Turkey. Speaking to reporters ahead of the
meeting, [Alexander Lavrentiev, the Kremlin's special Syria envoy and
head of the Russian delegation, **called Turkey's intervention plan an
"illogical and irrational" prospect that threatens "an escalation of
tension and a new military confrontation in those areas,"** according to
Syrian media. He dismissed speculation that Russia could turn a blind
eye in return for Turkey blocking Sweden's and Finland's accession to
NATO. "There is no such thing. We are not bargaining. We are not giving
up on our allies in the region," he said.]{.underline} Ali Asghar Khaji,
[the head of the Iranian delegation, "underlined that Syria's
territorial integrity and sovereignty are **untouchable**" in a meeting
with the Turkish delegation]{.underline}, according to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Ayman
Sousan, who led the Syrian delegation, urged the United Nations "to rein
in \[Erdogan's\] aggressive policies" in a meeting with UN officials,
Syrian media reported. In response, the UN officials cited statements by
the UN secretary-general's spokesperson in support of Syria's
sovereignty and against fresh escalatory moves in the country. In
separate talks with the Russians, Sousan rejected Turkey's pretexts for
attacks on Syrian territory, charging that they were designed "to
achieve its expansionist ideals" and that "the Syrian people are
determined to defend their country \[and\] resist the occupation."
Lavrentiev, for his part, pledged Russia would do its best to prevent
further escalation in Syria. In the final statement, [the parties
denounced "separatist agendas" in Syria in a nod to Turkey's security
concerns and a rebuke of the Kurdish groups leading the de facto
self-rule in the north.]{.underline} They also reaffirmed commitment to
Syria's sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and a political
settlement to the conflict, as they have done in all previous statements
in the past six years. In Turkey's view, its control of significant
chunks of Syrian territory does not contradict that commitment. [The
parties also pledged to work together "to combat terrorism in all forms
and manifestations."]{.underline} The sixth point of the statement
referred to Kurdish-held areas in northeast Syria, saying that lasting
security and stability in the region can only be achieved by preserving
Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The wording matched the
arguments that Russia has put forward against Turkey's attempts to
expand its control in northern Syria. Simply put, [Moscow argues that
the best way to address Ankara's security concerns is to ensure that the
Syrian army returns all the way to the Turkish border as Ankara begins
to cooperate with Damascus and discuss joint measures under the 1998
Adana accord on security cooperation between the two countries. The
communique suggests that **Ankara has toed Moscow's line**, at least on
paper.]{.underline} In the same paragraph, the statement acknowledged
Turkey's concerns, saying that the parties reject "all attempts to
create new realities on the ground, including illegitimate self-rule
initiatives under the pretext of combating terrorism." In a reference to
the United States, the statement denounced "the illegal seizure and
transfer of oil revenues that should belong to Syria" and "the actions
of countries that support terrorist entities including illegitimate
self-rule initiatives in the northeast of Syria." Pledging continued
cooperation to eliminate the Nusra Front, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State
and other UN-designated terrorist groups, the statement expressed
"serious concern" with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which holds sway in Idlib
and with which Turkey has tacitly cooperated on the ground. It stressed
also the need to facilitate the return of refugees and support the
UN-sponsored process of drafting a new constitution for Syria. The text,
released by the Kazakh hosts of the meeting, did not explicitly mention
the YPG or the PKK, but Turkey's state-run Anatolia news agency said the
final communique emphasized Turkey's determination to "fight the PKK/YPG
terrorist organization" and enact "any measures to protect our borders
and prevent attacks on our people and security forces and innocent
Syrian civilians." Russia's denunciation of "separatist agendas" --- a
reference to the Kurds' autonomy drive and partnership with the United
States --- suggests that it is shifting to a position more pleasing to
Turkey. This trend has been tangible in other statements in recent
times. Moscow's temperate policy on the Kurds appears to be wearing out
amid rising Russian-US tensions over Ukraine, opening room for Ankara to
maneuver. According to media reports on the talks, the Turkish side
insisted that the YPG's removal from Tel Rifaat and Manbij was a
commitment that Russia failed to deliver under the 2019 Sochi deal,
while the Russians recalled Turkey's outstanding commitment to eliminate
terrorist groups in Idlib and reopen the M4 motorway. Such exchanges
between Turkey and Russia have recurred time and again as a tactic to
balance or restrain each other. The talks in Nur-Sultan were significant
in terms of clarifying Moscow's attitude on Ankara's intervention
threat, for its initial reactions were softer and more ambivalent
compared to similar tensions in the past, contrasting the firm
objections of Tehran. Some Russian statements even sought to justify
Turkey's security concerns, fueling speculation that Turkish-Russian
bargaining on issues related to NATO and Ukraine might extend to the
conflict in Syria. Nevertheless, [a marked difference was visible
between Russia's rhetoric and its actions on the ground. **Russia took a
number of steps signaling solidarity with the Syrian army**, including
joint military exercises in the south of Idlib on June 10.]{.underline}
In a series of firsts, the Russians installed a Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft
system at the Hasakah airport in the northeast; deployed tanks, armored
vehicles, anti-aircraft weapons and missiles to the Abkar base in the
same region; and dispatched eight helicopters to the Abu al-Duhur base
in eastern Idlib. Russian planes and helicopters rumbled in the skies of
northeastern cities such as Qamishli, Tel Tamir, Amuda, Darbasiyah and
Ras al-Ayn. The Iranians, meanwhile, deployed reinforcements to the
vicinity of Tel Rifaat and moved Shiite militia from Deir ez-Zor to the
al-Nayrab base to the east of Aleppo. In other words, [**Russia** and
Iran were **naysaying a Turkish intervention** with their actions on the
ground, and any expectation that they would step back in the talks in
Nur-Sultan was unrealistic.]{.underline} Though the final statement
touched prominently on Turkey's concerns, the settlement path it
outlined is dismissive of military intervention.

#### Non-unique--Turkey is mediating between Russia and Ukraine [now]{.underline}

**Kirby 22** (Jen Kirby, Foreign and National Security Reporter, April
1, 2022, "What diplomatic solution might end the war in Ukraine?",
<https://www.vox.com/2022/4/1/23002085/peace-talks-ukraine-russia-war-turkey-neutrality>//RM)

[The war in Ukraine has ground on for five weeks. For almost as long,
Russian and Ukrainian officials have been attempting to negotiate. Those
negotiations have yielded few firm results so far, especially as Russia
continues to bombard Ukrainian cities. Still, the talking matters.
Diplomacy is the only way this war will finally end, and the type of
agreement that might end the fighting looks a lot clearer than it did
even a month ago.]{.underline} In the early days of the war, the talks
made little apparent progress. Ukraine appeared to be demanding an
immediate ceasefire, and Russian withdrawal of troops. Russia, however,
had pretty different ideas. It laid out some aggressive demands. Among
them were: Ukraine's neutrality and no membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO); so-called "demilitarization and
"denazification;" the protection of Russian language within Ukraine; and
that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the
independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions in eastern Ukraine
that Vladimir Putin had declared as independent on the eve of his
full-scale invasion. [In recent days, some glimmers of optimism have
emerged. Ukraine has put forward serious proposals, which is centered
around a commitment to permanent neutrality and an agreement not to seek
NATO membership, in exchange for security guarantees. Russia has also
reportedly eased up on some of its previous demands, including
"denazification" --- a likely ruse for regime change --- and
"demilitarization," a sign that Ukraine's battlefield successes so far
have pushed the Kremlin to possibly reconsider some of its most
maximalist demands. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, who is
helping to broker the talks, described the discussions earlier in the
week as "the most meaningful progress since the start of
negotiations."]{.underline} But these really are just glimmers of
progress --- and they might not be so long lasting. Russia, this week,
promised to "drastically reduce" military activity around Kyiv and
Chernihiv, in the name of "mutual trust," though reports of shelling
continued in those areas. Some, including US and NATO officials, have
expressed skepticism that Moscow is sincere, and instead using talks to
buy time, so it can regroup and refocus its offensive, potentially on
areas in eastern and southern Ukraine. Since then, both Russia and
Ukraine have downplayed the seriousness of the talks, even as
negotiations resumed Friday. And huge gulfs remain. Perhaps the most
intractable problem may be the future of the Crimean peninsula, which
Russia annexed in 2014, and Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia and
Russia-backed militias control parts of. Ukraine is unlikely to agree to
slice up its country. It is also hard to imagine Russia settling for
less territory than it controlled the day before its invasion in
February 2022. Other issues will emerge, and concessions and proposals
may shift depending on developments in the battlefield. The prospect of
a quick peace deal between Ukraine and Russia remains unlikely. Perhaps
the best case short term is that both sides broker a ceasefire that
includes a framework for an agreement, and then work the details out
over time. But the war continues.

Lysychansk for weeks[. The military said it decided to withdraw
because]{.underline} remaining in the city would bring "[fatal
consequences," given **the Russian forces' "overwhelming advantage**" in
"artillery, aviation, ammunition and personnel."]{.underline} The
decision was "made to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders," according
to a statement posted on Facebook. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky vowed to return. "If the command of our army withdraws people
from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire
superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one
thing: We will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in
the supply of modern weapons," Zelensky said in his nightly address
Sunday. "Ukraine does not give anything up." The city is a key target in
Russia's battle to capture the Donbas region, the heavily industrialized
area bordering Russia that is partly controlled by separatists loyal to
Moscow. In 2014, they unilaterally established two independent
"republics" in the Donbas region. 'They're in hell': Hail of Russian
artillery tests Ukrainian morale Russian President Vladimir Putin cited
false claims of Ukrainian "genocide" against Russian-speaking residents
there as justification for his invasion. Russia's latest advances in
eastern Ukraine add to creeping doubts among U.S. lawmakers and
observers of the war that the Ukrainian government can stop Putin from
seizing territory. [Optimism sparked by the defeat of his forces in the
battle for Kyiv in the spring has faded as **Russian artillery hammers
Ukrainian forces** and civilian targets. As Ukraine war bogs down, U.S.
assessments face scrutiny President Biden said last week that U.S.
support for Ukraine is unshakable and will continue "as long as it
takes" to ensure a Russian defeat. "We continue to fight. Unfortunately,
the steel willpower and patriotism are not enough to achieve success ---
**we need the technical resources**,"]{.underline} the Ukrainian
military's statement added. Why is Ukraine's Donbas region a target for
Russian forces? Ukrainian troops withdrew just over a week ago from
Severodonetsk, a city across the Donets River to the east. Russia's
capture of Lysychansk, if confirmed, would be a major victory that gives
its troops clear access to Donetsk, the other region that makes up
Donbas. Biden administration officials say Putin's gains have been
uneven and have come at a significant cost, highlighting the steep death
toll among Russian troops. But Ukrainian forces also are paying a heavy
price, which U.S. military officials rarely acknowledge. Ukraine

Donbas is the primary goal of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine,
after it failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, and other areas in the
initial weeks of the war. [Russian troops and their allies have been
making steady gains in the east, as officials in Kyiv say they are
outgunned and running out of ammunition.]{.underline} Ukrainian Defense
Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sak told the BBC earlier Sunday that Ukraine
controls other cities in Donetsk and argued that "the battle for the
Donbas is not over yet." Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region,
said earlier in the day that in attacking Lysychansk, Russian fighters
used tactics even more brutal than in Severodonetsk to overcome
resistance. Photos showed bombed-out residential buildings in Lysychansk
early Sunday, amid a barrage reminiscent of the destruction of
Severodonetsk. As recently as Saturday, a Russian-backed politician said
Lysychansk was "completely surrounded," but defense officials in Ukraine
said they still had control of the city. Those counterclaims were
probably "outdated or erroneous," according to an analysis from the
Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank. It
cited unconfirmed videos showing Russian forces erecting a red "victory"
flag in Lysychansk and "casually walking around" its neighborhoods.
"Ukrainian forces likely conducted a deliberate withdrawal from
Lysychansk, resulting in the Russian seizure of the city on July 2," it
said. [As Russia issued its claim of control over Lysychansk on Sunday,
Slovyansk, a town about 50 miles west in Donetsk, came under intense
shelling]{.underline} that killed at least six people, local officials
said. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said in a video on Telegram that "the biggest
shelling of Slovyansk recently" had left "a large number of wounded and
dead." Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk region, told
Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that at least six people were
killed and 15 were injured in the shelling. She added that missiles hit
the town of Kramatorsk, to the south of Slovyansk. In its assessment
Saturday, [the ISW said Russia was likely to fully take over the Luhansk
region "in coming days" and would probably "then prioritize drives on
Ukrainian positions in Siversk before turning to Slovyansk and Bakhmut,"
in Donetsk]{.underline}. In other developments, Ukraine's ambassador to
Turkey said Sunday that Turkish authorities have detained a
Russian-flagged cargo ship loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain. Millions
of metric tons of grain await export from Ukraine, blockaded by Russia's
control of Black Sea shipping lanes. The export blockades have resulted
in global food shortages and rising prices, which have particularly
affected poorer countries. Three people were killed in Russian strikes
early Sunday in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Cities
across Kharkiv were shelled Saturday and Sunday, according to regional
governor Oleh Synyehubov. In one district, Russian forces "burned farm
buildings, garages, and shelled open areas," he added. Russian forces

#### Russia can't help Turkey's economy, they're in a recession of their own

**Carbonaro 6/30** (Giulia Carbonaro, US News Reporter, 6/30/22,
"Russia\'s Economy is Collapsing, Data Reveals",
<https://www.newsweek.com/russia-economy-collapsing-data-reveals-1720532>//RM)

[If Russia defaulting on its foreign debt for the first time since the
Bolshevik revolution wasn\'t a clear enough sign of the impact Western
sanctions are having on the Russian economy, a new report on the
country\'s socio-economic situation leaves no margin for doubt that the
Russian economy is gradually collapsing.]{.underline} New statistics on
the state of the Russian economy, produced by the country\'s Federal
State Statistics Service, show production has plunged in multiple
sectors, from vehicles to domestic appliances, as has retail confidence.
[Overall, Russia\'s industrial production index---a monthly economic
indicator measuring real output in the manufacturing, mining, electric,
and gas industries---dropped by 1.7 percent in May compared to the same
month in 2021. That\'s higher than the decline of 1.6 percent
year-on-year reported in April.]{.underline} Mining dropped by 0.8
percentage points in May 2022 compared to May 2021, and manufacturing
dropped by 3.2 percentage points. [The overall numbers seem quite
modest, but they reflect a downward trend that is more obvious in the
staggering drops affecting the production of specific
products.]{.underline} Above all, car production has suffered, and it\'s
now down by 96.7 percent compared to 2021. Production of trucks plunged
by 39.3 percent, that of diesel and gasoline engines by 57 percent, that
of diesel locomotives by 63.2 percent and that of freight wagons by 51.8
percent. French automaker Renault, which controls Russia\'s largest
carmaker AvtoVAZ, suspended operations at its Moscow plant in March,
under pressure from Ukrainian leaders to act in response to Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine. Renault later agreed to sell its Russian operations
for a nominal payment. Air cargo is down by 86 percent year on year.
Other products were also affected. The production of fridges is also
down by 58.1 percent compared with 2021 levels, that of washing machines
by 59.2 percent, that of AC electric motors by 49.9 percent. TV sets
were down by 49.7 percentage points. Production of elevators is down by
34.7 percent and that of excavators was down by 60 percent. Curiously,
cigarette production also dropped by 24.5 percent. Graphs show that
retail turnover and retail confidence have also gone down compared to
one year before and even from the beginning of 2022. Wholesale turnover
has also plunged drastically, with consumer demand dropping in what is
likely a reflection of lower wages amid high inflation in the country.
Even more significantly for the Russian population, pensions have also
fallen in real terms, decreasing by 8.2 percentage points year-on-year
in May, while salaries dropped by 7.2 percentage points in April
compared to a year prior. [These data are a clear sign that the Russian
economy is suffering, despite the fact that the rouble bounced back
after collapsing in late February following the invasion of Ukraine and
that the country has held up surprisingly better than expected after
Western sanctions were imposed.]{.underline} The drop in industrial
production is less than Western economists expected, but the economic
contraction of the country is still undeniable. Even the Russian central
bank said it expected a fall in GDP of 7.8 percent this year, almost in
line with Western predictions but not quite, as Western experts estimate
that the country\'s economy will shrink by 15 percent by the end of the
year, according to the Institute of International Finance\'s (IIF). One
piece of unexpected good news for Russia came from the jobs market, with
a record-low unemployment rate of 3.9 percent reported in May. And yet,
as high inflation continues to cripple wages in Russia, it\'s unlikely
this high employment will turn into higher consumer demand able to turn
the tide of Russia\'s likely incoming recession.

[Turkey's official inflation rate increased to almost 80% last month --
the highest in 24 years -- as President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n's
unconventional economic policies continued to drive up the cost of
living. The growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in
June, according to the Turkish statistics agency. However, opposition
parties and economists said recent hikes in oil and gas prices meant the
real rate of inflation was almost double the official
figure]{.underline}. The minister of treasury and finance, Nureddin
Nebati, has attempted to head off criticism of the government's handling
of the economy, saying last week that consumer prices would start
dropping by the end of the year. "I promise to you and to the president,
we will see a drop in inflation starting in December," Nebati said. His
comments came after the government announced its second increase in the
minimum wage in six months, raising pay by 30%. The increase lifted the
monthly salary of about 40% of the workforce from \$254 (춲209) to \$328.
Erdo르n has claimed that Turkey's problem is not inflation. "We do not
have an inflation problem. We have a cost of living problem," he said
last month. [Economists said Turkey's official data disguised a more
disturbing trend of rising prices that had shown no sign of abating. A
monthly report release by Turkey's ENAG group of independent economists
showed consumer prices had risen by 175% in June compared with a year
earlier. ENAG said prices had risen by 71.4% since the start of 2022.
The Istanbul chamber of commerce said inflation in Turkey's largest city
had reached an annual rate of 94%. "No one actually believes official
Turkish data any more," said Timothy Ash, an economist at BlueBay Asset
Management. "There is no expectation of anything like a credible policy
response]{.underline}." The growing dispute over the veracity of
Turkey's official data is expected to be a difficult political issue for
Erdo르n's government ahead of next year's general election, which is
widely viewed as the toughest of his two-decade rule. Kemal
K캼l캼칞daro륿u, the leader of the main opposition party, accused the state
statistics agency of "lying", urging it in a tweet to "stop committing
crimes for the benefit of President Erdo르n." A survey published by the
Metropol polling agency on Friday showed 69% of respondents believed the
unofficial ENAG figure and just 24% the one reported by the government.
[Turkey was hit hard by the fallout from the European debt crisis in
2012 and the threat of higher interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
in 2013. Its currency tumble ever since.]{.underline} In 2013 the lira
was worth 36p, compared with 4.9p on Monday. To arrest the decline, in
2018 Erdo르n embarked on what he called a "new economic model", which
meant setting aside rising inflation and cutting interest rates to boost
economic growth. This was done against the advice of his central bank
chief and caused the lira to plunge to a record low, pushing up costs in
a country that is dependent on imported materials, especially energy.
[Inflation, which officially stood at 15% at the beginning of 2021, has
now reached its highest level since a currency meltdown during the 1998
debt crisis that helped bring Erdo르n to power. Three central bank
bosses have been fired by the president since 2018. The Turkish lira has
plummeted 20% this year alone.]{.underline}

<https://www.abqjournal.com/1211250/will-turkeys-economic-woes-spill-over-into-other-countries.html//BVN>
SC)

WASHINGTON [-- The pertinent and unanswerable question about Turkey is
**whether the country's present economic turmoil is an isolated event**,
mostly confined to Turkey itself, **or whether it portends a larger
economic convulsion that shakes markets around the world.** Among
economists and other experts, there's no consensus. Some foresee
contagion: Turkey's problems will spread. Others envision a one-country
economic blip. **Which is it?**]{.underline} The answer obviously
matters. The global economy already faces obstacles to growth. American
interest rates are rising as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent higher
inflation. President Trump's trade wars are threatening. If we now add a
slowdown of "emerging market" economies -- China, Brazil and similar
"middle-income" nations -- the global expansion might sputter or halt.
[Turkey's experience is relevant. In recent months, its currency, the
lira, has collapsed. At the start of 2018, it was trading at roughly 4
lira to the dollar; now that's about 6 lira to the dollar.]{.underline}
This makes it harder for Turkish businesses and consumers to repay
debts, which -- more than in many other countries -- are often made in
dollars. To repay these debts, Turkish companies need to earn more lira,
which can be sold for dollars. The more lira go to repay dollar debts,
the fewer lira are left over to buy other things. Economic growth slows.
If debtors can't raise the dollars to repay their loans, they default.
Too many defaults, and growth stops. Turkey's debt problems are
undeniably daunting, notes economist Hung Tran of the Institute of
International Finance (IIF), an industry research and advocacy group.
Consider: Between now and the end of 2018, Turkey faces debt repayments
-- principal and interest -- of about \$120 billion; in 2019, the total
is about \$200 billion. By comparison, Turkey's economy -- gross
domestic product -- is about \$850 billion. Some of these loans could be
rolled over; how many is unclear. Many debts were incurred by banks or
private firms, encouraged by easy-money policies. The government pumped
up the economy in the wake of a failed military coup in 2016 and in
anticipation of a new election. The election was held in June 2018 and
won by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He was surely helped by the
economic stimulus. Last year, Turkey's GDP grew 7 percent, up from 3.2
percent in 2016. To complicate matters further, Turkey and the Trump
administration are feuding over the Turks' detention of Andrew Brunson,
an American pastor accused of anti-state activities. Now comes the
reckoning. [Many observers believe that what happened in Turkey **will
stay in Turkey.** Its economy is simply too small -- about 1.4 percent
of global GDP, according to some estimates -- to influence the rest of
the world. "**It's mainly a Turkish issue**," says economist C. Fred
Bergsten of the Peterson Institute. He doesn't expect large spillover
effects, say a slowdown of growth in Europe or capital flight from other
"emerging market" countries, such as Brazil or India.]{.underline} Not
all economists are so hopeful. Writing in The Hill, Desmond Lachman of
the American Enterprise Institute predicts that ["Turkey will **default
on its debt** and impose capital controls." Capital controls are legal
restrictions on money movements in and out of a country. He expects
contagion -- capital flight from heavily indebted countries -- **that
will weaken the global recovery and hurt the U.S.
economy**.]{.underline} Economist Tran of the IIF thinks that
emerging-market countries that have problems similar to Turkey's -- poor
policies, maturing debts, sizable current account deficits -- are the
most vulnerable to capital flight. These include South Africa, Indonesia
and Egypt. [So far, the evidence is reassuring; the IIF's most recent
survey of capital movements didn't detect any sizable money surges since
the lira's latest large drop.]{.underline} Crowd psychology could
trigger a panic. If investors expect other investors to sell, there
could be a stampede for the door. This story isn't over yet. [What's
uncontroversial, at least among many economists, is that **Turkey will
need to go to the IMF to end the present crisis**. The]{.underline} IMF
would provide a hefty loan -- it's doubtful anyone else would -- and
impose "tough austerity policies" designed to improve the economy's
performance, says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. By
their nature, these policies would be unpopular, especially with
Erdogan, because they "could weaken (his) hold on power," as Kirkegaard
puts it. It seems likely that he would resent and resist them as long as
possible. That could change everything. Stay tuned.

#### Turkish economy [resilient]{.underline}--hyperinflation is [normal]{.underline} for the economy

resilience has defied worst fears", Financial Times,

SC)

[The warnings back in 2011-2013 were ominous: "If the Turkish lira
breaks through 2 against the dollar, the economy will implode." Once the
2 was reached, the new implosion target moved to 3, then to 5, and here
we are at 13. **The economy is still standing**.]{.underline} An economy
with debt in dollars as high as Turkey's should seemingly have imploded
a long time ago under such currency volatility. The history of emerging
markets is littered with balance of payments crises under similar
foreign exchange depreciations. There might be several reasons for this
resilience. For one, up until earlier this year, [the Turkish
authorities did what they always had done in the past when confronted
with capital outflows and currency weakness: interest rate hikes, if
only belatedly and often in an obfuscated manner. **This boom-and-bust
way of managing the economy kept the system going for quite some
time**.]{.underline} That time is what gave economic actors the chance
to build buffers against an unbalanced economy. [Banks, for example,
kept balance sheets largely hedged on currency. By virtue of a build-up
of dollar deposits and a low level of foreign currency loans made
relative to them, banks also had excess dollars.]{.underline} So they
kept lending dollars to obtain cheap lira funding, creating in the
process another safety mechanism for themselves. But it hasn't been only
banks which have built resilience over time. [As dollarisation
progressed, households have continued to accumulate dollar assets but no
foreign exchange liabilities. This is because banks were forbidden to
lend foreign currency to households, **making them a lot more resilient
to currency risk**.]{.underline} This was perhaps the regulators'
greatest foresight. The creditor profile of the country has also changed
over time. Fickle portfolio flows have greatly reduced. Foreigners used
to own nearly 30 per cent of the local debt market but this number is
now less than 5 per cent (a mere \$3bn in absolute terms). Meanwhile
locals now own almost 50 per cent of the country's sovereign Eurobonds.
This has left Turkey more dependent on different types of external
creditor --- the syndicated loan market, trade finance, intra-corporate
lending, or domestic lenders. These creditors are more patient, more
long-term oriented than foreign portfolio investors. [The passing of
time has also allowed Turkish corporates, the weakest link in the
country's external balance sheet chain, to **reduce debt levels**
somewhat while building a positive net short-term foreign exchange
position.]{.underline} The problem, however, remains one of
co-ordination. While on paper each economic sector has enough liquidity
buffers of its own, they are all "joined at the hip". One sector drawing
on its foreign exchange assets has a ripple effect on the entire system,
as those assets will be residing in someone else's balance sheet.
Against that, the country is tentatively turning its persistent current
account deficit into a surplus by virtue of the very large lira
depreciation which boosts exports and contracts imports. Whether this
turn in the current account, if it materialises, is yet another
boom-and-bust episode or a structural manifestation of a policy-driven
rebalancing of the economy remains unclear. [All in all, it's been **a
surprisingly resilient journey**, though longer than many of us would
have anticipated. Turks also have suffered from high inflation and a
squeeze in purchasing power in dollars.]{.underline} And the fact that
**[Turkey hasn't "broken" yet]{.underline}** doesn't mean it still
can't.

[Risks aside, Turkey boasts a large, diversified, **resilient economy
with a solid banking sector**]{.underline}, an executive at Moody's
Investors Service, a sister company of the global ratings agency, said
Monday. ["They (Turkish banks) have had pretty good results. They are
solid,"]{.underline} Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president within
Moody's Investors Service Sovereign Risk Group, told Anadolu Agency
(AA), [citing "stabilizing factors."]{.underline} ["**Exporters are
benefiting clearly very much from the (Turkish lira's) depreciation**,"
she said, praising the country's "large diversified resilient
economy."]{.underline} She noted that [Turkey may benefit from supply
chain shifts]{.underline} in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
"Turkey can benefit massively from a nearshoring of production by
European companies and (from its) Customs Union with the EU." She said
prospects for Turkish economic growth are optimistic, adding: ["Exports
are doing well. Lira depreciation helps. There are clear incentives such
as credit stimulus for exporters and investments."]{.underline}
Muehlbronner welcomed steps by the Turkish government to shield the
poorest households from inflation. Propelled by rising energy and
commodity prices, [Turkey's annual inflation runs at a 20-year high of
nearly 70% as of April, according to official data.]{.underline}
Consumer prices have been increasing despite tax cuts on basic goods and
government subsidies for utility bills to ease the burden on household
budgets. After it took a hit from the pandemic like the rest of the
world, Muehlbronner said she expects the Turkish tourism sector to have
a good season. [She underlined that the **Turkish economy may grow
faster** than Moody's forecast of 3% this year.]{.underline} On
inflation, Muehlbronner said the upward trend stemmed from the weaker
lira, especially through end-2021 and elevated commodity prices. ["We
think inflation will drop kind of mechanically at the end of the year
because of a base effect,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner noted. Listing
risks to the Turkish economy, she said high inflation, currency pressure
and loose monetary policy create downside risks for the country. The
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is expected to hold its
key policy rate unchanged at 14% for the fifth straight month on
Thursday, according to surveys. Inflation has surged since last autumn
as the lira weakened after the central bank in September embarked on a
500-basis point-easing cycle. [The government's foreign
exchange-protected lira deposits tool]{.underline}, she said, ["was
certainly a good step to stabilize the currency. And it has **reduced
dollarization of deposits by around 10 percentage
points."**]{.underline} Muehlbronner was referring to the scheme that
the government unveiled in December to boost lira deposits by protecting
them against exchange rate volatility. Ankara has called on individuals
and companies to convert their foreign exchange savings to lira to
support the currency. ["So, we're back to the levels of share of
deposits and dollars that we had before the latest currency crisis. So
that's certainly a positive step,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner added.

### 2AC -- AT: Nuclear Ukraine

#### Putin [won't]{.underline} use nuclear weapons--NATO will [retaliate]{.underline} if he does

**Ullman 2/16** (Harlan Ullman, Harlan Ullman is an Atlantic Council
senior advisor and UPI's Arnaud deBorchgrave Distinguished Columnist,
2/16/22, "Why Putin won't invade Ukraine",
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-putin-wont-invade-ukraine/>/RM

In regard to Ukraine, [Putin also knows that an armed attack or
aggressive use of force will make any chance of his achieving both his
priorities even less likely than landing an astronaut on the sun. He
also knows that the costs to Russia and to him personally will be high
and possibly unaffordable. Sanctions and further isolation will hurt.
Going to war, no matter the scope, or using cyber and influence
operations to cripple Ukraine, will absolutely foreclose any chance for
even part of Putin's demands being considered by NATO. The Alliance's
response to a major attack will make the actions it took after Russia's
2014 Crimean annexation appear anemic. It will expand its military
capability and the number of forces stationed in Europe---exactly the
opposite of Putin's intent. NATO members will develop and deploy more
advanced weapons, including new classes of missiles with low-yield
nuclear warheads.]{.underline} NATO badly needs a new strategic
framework (here, ironically, Putin is right for the wrong reasons). If
war breaks out in Ukraine, the Alliance will certainly move to a new
framework incorporating some of the actions mentioned above and announce
it during the Madrid summit in June---another outcome Putin won't like
one bit. [In an escalation, the West will impose sanctions more strictly
and robustly than before. How much this will dent Russia's economy or
Putin's inner circle is uncertain. But the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
pipeline will almost certainly be cancelled, denting Russia's energy
sector. Whatever credibility Putin may have gained will be lost given
the "big lie" of his assurances that force would not be used in Ukraine.
Of course, Russia will have accused the West of provoking violence
requiring an "appropriate response."]{.underline} If a subsequent
occupation of Ukraine were required, even of just a portion of the
country, body bags could be flowing back to Russia. And what is Putin's
exit strategy? No such plan following a Russian attack is obvious for
Moscow other than a prolonged twenty-first century version of the Cold
War, but one in which Moscow uses substantial force resulting in even
greater isolation. And that could doom Putin's rule in a way similar to
how Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev got fired two years after the
October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. An advantageous stalemate The
billion-ruble question is: How does this crisis end? Speculation over
invasion scenarios has ranged from a massive, overwhelming air, sea, and
land assault to a mix of cyber, special-forces, and influence-based
non-kinetic operations. Should Putin not grasp the predicament he has
imposed on himself, a limited move in the Donbas or seizing a land
bridge into Crimea would seem to be the lowest-risk and lowest-cost
option. He could then judge how NATO chooses to respond and wait. But
Putin would almost certainly suffer the same consequences as if he took
Kyiv and occupied much of the country. Assuming there is no military
action, Putin has two choices. First, he can prolong the crisis and
maintain the buildup on the Ukrainian border. That would be expensive
and wear down his forces. Staying on constant alert takes a toll on
people and pocketbooks. Or Putin could terminate the exercise with
Belarus on February 20 as scheduled, draw his troops back from the
Ukrainian border, claim victory, and continue to push for
negotiations---arguing that as the West wrongly predicted an attack, it
continues to fail to recognize Russian security interests and needs.
Russia will no doubt continue political and psychological pressure on
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make concessions, either to
accept the Minsk 2 agreement (despite its grant of semi-autonomy to the
Donbas) or to suspend any request for NATO membership. And Russian
"active measures," such as disinformation campaigns, will continue to
target Ukraine with the aim of eroding Zelenskyy's standing and NATO
solidarity by claiming "hysteria" over an invasion that never occurred.
This scenario suits Putin's interests far better than an uncertain
military adventure, which is why he will choose it---and not because of
anything uttered from a White House podium, no matter how much credit
the administration will take for deterring a war.

#### Russia [won't escalate]{.underline} to nuclear weapons--he [loses]{.underline} China if they do

**Corera 4/26** (Gordon Corera, Security correspondent, BBC News, April
26, 2022, "Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?",
<https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169>//RM)

Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so using nuclear weapons on its
territory seems bizarre. Russia itself is close by and \"the fallout
could cross boundaries\", warns Patricia Lewis. The only time nuclear
weapons have been used in conflict was by the US at the end of World War
Two against Japan. [Would Putin want to become the first leader to break
the taboo and use them? Some worry he has shown a willingness to do
things others thought he would not do, whether invading Ukraine or using
nerve agent in Salisbury. Dr Williams says there is a further reason why
Russia might not use nuclear weapons - China. \"Russia is heavily
dependent on Chinese support, but China has a \'no first use\' nuclear
doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for
China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.\"
Could it lead to nuclear war? No one knows quite where the use of
tactical nuclear weapons would lead. It could escalate and Putin would
not want nuclear war. But miscalculation is always a risk. \"They would
imagine everyone would capitulate,\" says Patricia Lewis. \"What would
happen is that Nato would have to come in and respond.\"]{.underline}
The US says it is monitoring the situation closely. It has an extensive
intelligence gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for
instance whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if
there is any change in behaviour at launch sites. [So far, they say they
have not seen any significant changes. How the US and Nato would respond
to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the
situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want
to draw a line. This might mean a tough conventional rather than nuclear
response.]{.underline} But what would Russia then do? \"Once you have
crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point,\"
says James Acton. \"I don\'t think anyone can have any confidence of
what that world would look like.\"
