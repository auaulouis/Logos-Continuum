### 1NC\-\--AT: Turkey

#### Appeasement fails. 

**Aktar 22** \[Cengiz Aktar; professor of political science at the
University of Athens; 5-23-2022; \"**[Appease and enable]{.underline}**:
[The West's **disastrous**]{.underline} Russia and [Turkey
policies]{.underline}\"; POLITICO;

KL\]

Despite how odd Turkey's strategic choices as a NATO member may be, the
West continues to do business as usual with Ankara.

Western powers once again make excuses for President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan, understanding Turkey's mysterious "legitimate security
concerns," which often equates to a license to kill. But by appeasing
him for the sake of "keeping" the country within NATO, they miss the
point that the Turkish leader is not so different from Russian President
Vladimir Putin --- and that once again, a [policy of appeasement
**simply won't work**]{.underline}.

[As the war in Ukraine has unfolded, Turkey has been allowed to
**indulge** in its long-running **double game**]{.underline},
[continuing to play Russia and the West **against each
other**]{.underline}, delivering pre-ordered drones to Kyiv on the one
hand, while ignoring sanctions against Moscow and opposing Finland and
Sweden's applications to join NATO on the other.

[But as **pointless offers** to broker peace by Turkey's president have
"convinced]{.underline}" [the West of Ankara's "strategic
value]{.underline}," [Erdoğan]{.underline} --- "[the
**dictator**]{.underline} we need," to quote Italian Prime Minister
Mario Draghi --- [is back on the **global stage** once
more]{.underline}. Even United States President Joe Biden's
administration has started lobbying lawmakers to agree to the delivery
of fighter jets to Ankara.

Yet the similarities between Russia and Turkey today, as well as the
strongmen who have shaped them, draw an obvious and ominous parallel
that should be noted by Western leaders.

Topping the list of citizen complaints before the European Court of
Human Rights, the systems Erdoğan and Putin have crafted disregard the
rule of law and supersede it with one-man rule, as they both have
surrounded themselves by oligarchs and yes-men. Both countries are
undemocratic, their elections neither free nor fair, their regimes
pushing narratives and pursuing actions that are irredentist,
revisionist and bellicose.

In both Russia and Turkey, the opposition --- or what remains of it ---
is systematically hounded and repressed, its leaders attacked or jailed,
as in the cases of Alexei Navalny and Selahattin Demirtaş. And there
still exist large crowds who recklessly support "their" regimes.

In Europe, Germany has played a central role in appeasing these
dictators over the years. And while the country's elite has started some
timid soul-searching about its policy toward Russia in the wake of
Ukraine's invasion, it remains wedded to appeasement and engagement with
Turkey.

During her time in office, former Chancellor Angela Merkel developed a
Faustian pact with Erdoğan, paying 10 visits to Turkey--- three in 2016
alone, when the country was politically and morally devastated ---
setting a record among Western leaders. And as Merkel continued to visit
and welcome Erdoğan in Germany, neither his authoritarian drive at home,
nor [Turkey's aggressive moves in the **Eastern Mediterranean**,
**Iraq**, **Libya** and **Syria** or its U.N.-documented sponsorship of
jihadi terrorism]{.underline} lessened. None of this deterred Merkel's
unconditional support either, including arms sales --- just as with
Russia.

Since 2015, the EU has followed this appeasement policy initiated and
led by Merkel. And Ankara's pro-EU utterances, [its empty rhetoric on
reforms and tactical retreats from confrontation are systematically
**taken for granted** by the pro-Ankara axis]{.underline}.

[This **cynical agenda** is driven by the fear of losing "NATO partner
Turkey" to Russia]{.underline}. In addition, Europeans have been
avoiding jeopardizing their economic interests in Turkey and are fearful
of placing their refugee deal with Ankara at risk. They have also been
terrified of doing anything that might trigger a social implosion ---
despite the fact that [appeasement is not an adequate answer to any of
these of these **angsts**]{.underline}.

[The more the]{.underline} EU and the [West appease, the more **brazen**
and **entrenched** Erdoğan becomes, and the more **insolent** and
**dangerous** he is for others]{.underline}. Exactly like Putin.

There are strong similarities between Russian arrogance toward
Ukrainians and Turkish high-handedness toward the Kurds. Ankara targets
anything that sounds or looks Kurdish --- inside or outside the country.
And both Erdoğan and Putin see it as their historic missions to
"civilize" these "substandard" and finally "non-existing" nations, to
invoke their right to self-defense and preventive strikes against Nazis
and terrorists respectively, who they say threaten to attack
"peace-loving" Russia or Turkey.

When it comes to the rules of "war" --- a proscribed term in both
countries --- both armies outdo others' war crimes against civilians.
Putin targets Ukrainian grain warehouses; Erdoğan steals the olive oil
of Syrian Kurds; and both have cut water supplies. Forced relocation and
ethnic cleansing have been common practice in both countries. In
Turkish-occupied northern Syria, the Kurdish language is banned in
official institutions and schools and replaced by Turkish, much like in
occupied Ukrainian land, where Russian has ousted the Ukrainian and
Turkish Tatar languages.

Despite the disastrous consequences of its pre-invasion policy toward
Russia, the West continues to indulge their illusions about
[Turkey]{.underline}. Appeasers fail to understand that Western
standards, values and principles are obstacles to the functioning of
these regimes.

Thus, they [cannot be engaged through values and rules-based approaches
but need to be treated as what they are]{.underline} --- **[security
threats]{.underline}**.

And [speaking of **open acts** of **aggression**]{.underline}, [[I ask
you]{.underline}]{.mark}, esteemed [members of Congress, [not to
forget]{.mark} an **open wound** that has caused Hellenism]{.underline}
**[unending pain]{.underline}** [over the past 48 years. I am referring
to [the **invasion**]{.mark} and subsequent **division** of
**[Cyprus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This issue has to be resolved in
accordance with **international law**]{.underline} and in line with the
relevant decisions of the United Nations Security Council. As I told
President Biden yesterday, [nobody can and **nobody will** accept a two-
state solution in Cyprus]{.underline}.

The same is true for all other regional disputes. Greece is a peace
seeking democracy that always extends a hand of friendship to our
neighbors. We are always open to dialogue. But there is only one
framework we can use to resolve our differences: international law and
the unwritten principles of good neighborly relations.

I want to be absolutely clear. [[We **will not accept**]{.mark} open
**acts of [aggression]{.mark}** [that violate our]{.mark}
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} our **[territorial
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These include overflights over Greek
islands, [[which must **stop immediately**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Please also note: [[the **last thing**]{.mark} [that NATO
needs]{.mark}]{.underline} at a time when our focus is on helping
Ukraine defeat Russia's aggression [[is]{.mark} **[a]{.mark}nother
[source of instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on [NATO's]{.mark}

#### Greece war draws in [great powers]{.underline}.

Amid the ongoing US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine, [tensions are
**rising dangerously** between NATO member states **Turkey** and
**Greece**]{.underline} in the Aegean Sea. [The two countries are
holding **war games** aimed at each other, trading accusations of
disregarding **international treaties**, and violating **each other's
borders** with jet fighters and warships]{.underline}.

The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) Ephesus 2022 exercise, held in the Aegean
Sea and attended by more than 10,000 military personnel, ended last
week. Thirty-seven countries, including the United States and Italy,
participated in air, sea and land drills. Held in Seferihisar, only 1.5
kilometers from the nearby Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, the
exercise was based on the scenario of a "military landing on an island."
It was widely treated in Turkish capitalist media as a threat against
Greece.

Greek media reported that during Greece\'s naval exercise Storm 2022,
which ended on May 27, Turkey sent "two F-16 fighter jets that violated
Greek airspace, reaching just two 2.5 nautical miles from the northern
port city of Alexandroupoli."

During the Ephesus 2022 exercise, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
accused Greece of militarizing Aegean Sea islands in violation of
international agreements. He warned Athens \'one last time\' on this:
"We invite Greece to stop militarizing the islands that have
non-military status and to act in accordance with international
agreements. I'm not joking, I'm speaking seriously."

Threatening to militarize Turkish islands if necessary to threaten
Greece, Erdoğan said, "We again warn Greece to avoid dreams, statements
and actions that will lead to regret, just as they did a century ago," a
reference to the Turkish war of independence against the British-backed
Greek invasion in 1919-1922.

A week ago, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu accused Greece of
violating its peace treaties with Turkey: "But what is another reason
for Greece to be aggressive? Greece\'s violation of the status of the
islands given to it in the 1923 Lausanne Treaty and 1947 Paris Treaty
under the condition of not militarizing them \[Greek islands in the
Aegean Sea\], and our raising this violation within the framework of
international law."

Cavusoglu added: "The sovereignty of the islands will be questioned if
Greece does not end its violation." This threat to "question" Greece's
sovereignty over islands it controls amount to a threat to invade them
and go to war.

The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted to the Ephesus-2022 exercise and
statements by Turkish officials on Twitter, writing, "[Ankara poses a
**threat** to **regional peace** and **security**]{.underline}." On
Thursday, Greek government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou dismissed the
Turkish claims, calling them "Ahistorical claims and baseless myths that
can neither challenge nor, let alone, substitute for international law
and international treaties."

Accusing Erdoğan of provocation, Oikonomou threatened, "It is clear to
everyone that [our country has upgraded its
**geostrategic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[geopolitical
footprint]{.underline}** [as well as its **deterrent capacity** to be
able at any time to **defend**]{.underline} its national sovereignty and
sovereign rights."

A century after World War I began in the Balkans, NATO and the bourgeois
[governments in the region again risk **plunging the world** into a
**catastrophic war**]{.underline}. In 2020, tensions between Turkey and
Greece over natural gas and sea borders in the eastern Mediterranean
were defused by EU and especially German mediation. Greek-Turkish talks
resumed. However, as the World Socialist Web Site warned, "History shows
such conflicts cannot be peacefully resolved under capitalism, whether
or not a temporary Greek-Turkish peace deal is somehow reached."

The US-NATO war on Russia in Ukraine has now inflamed the Greek-Turkish
conflict, turning the Aegean into an undeclared second front in the
NATO-Russia war.

The right-wing government of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
has unabashedly aligned itself with Washington's moves against Russia.
The Greek port of Alexandroupoli in the northern Aegean Sea has been
transformed into a major US military base. Alexandroupoli is also being
used to deliver weapons to Ukraine and to NATO forces along the border
with Ukraine in Romania.

The Turkish bourgeoisie has pursued a cynical, two-faced policy on the
NATO war on Russia. On the one hand, it has backed NATO's Ukraine
policy, including the far-right coup NATO backed in Kiev in 2014, and
armed Kiev with armed Bayraktar TB2 drones. On the other, it has kept
diplomatic channels with Russia open, greeting Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov in Ankara, and posed certain obstacles to the most
aggressive NATO moves targeting Russia.

Ankara closed the straits linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea
coast of Ukraine and Russia to both NATO and Russian warships, blocking
a NATO naval attack on Russia. It also threatened to veto NATO's plans
to absorb Sweden and Finland and post NATO troops on Russia's northern
border with Scandinavia. The Turkish government was not objecting to the
war, however, but continuing its long-standing targeting of the Kurdish
people: it denounced Sweden and Finland for having ties to
Kurdish-nationalist organizations.

Washington responded to this veto threat by inviting Mitsotakis to give
a speech denouncing Turkey in the US Congress. During his
enthusiastically received speech, Mitsotakis blamed Turkey for the
division of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and demanded a halt to US
F-16 sales to Turkey. US President Joe Biden also gave Mitsotakis strong
support.

Erdoğan condemned Mitsotakis\' trip, declaring that Mitsotakis "no
longer exists" for him. Erdoğan added that he viewed the US-NATO bases
in Greece, targeting Russia and growing Chinese economic influence in
the region, as a threat to his government, saying, "And, most
importantly, there are nearly a dozen bases in Greece. Whom does Greece
threaten with those bases?"

Workers in Greece, Turkey and internationally must be warned: [the
danger that the conflicts in the Black Sea and the Balkans will
**escalate uncontrollably** into a **world war** is very
great]{.underline}. In the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, prices
are spiraling out of control as the financial aristocracy massively
increases its wealth. This has provoked strikes and protests
internationally, and capitalist governments are all terrified of the
international eruption of the class struggle.

#### Russian-Turkish relations are [inevitable]{.underline}.

[Turkish-Russian **rapprochement**]{.underline} and future of the
transatlantic alliance

Turkish-Russian relations deteriorated after Turkey's shot down of a
Russian jet over Turkish territory in November 2015. However, the failed
coup attempt marked a new beginning between the two. [Both countries
have **reached agreements** on **several issues**, including the
maintaining **territorial integrity**]{.underline} [of
**Syria**]{.underline} despite their differences of opinion about the
future of the Assad regime. Along with individual leaders' common
frustration with the Western countries, [both countries also have been
driven by **pragmatism**]{.underline} (Ibryamova and Kara 2017). In
[Turkey and Russia, the decision-making mechanism is **centralized**
around one person]{.underline}. [Both leaders, Erdoğan and Putin, have
strong **leadership characteristics**]{.underline} and have been in
power for a long time, [which evidences that]{.underline}, further to
the strategic interest, [Turkish-Russian reconciliation is also the
result of the **overlapping ideologies**]{.underline} of both political
leaders on several issues, [including being **sceptical**]{.underline}
[about the Western countries' **intentions**]{.underline}, [restricting
**media freedom**]{.underline}, **[oppressing
oppositions]{.underline}**, [and using **nationalist
narration**]{.underline} [and **religious values**]{.underline} [in
policy making]{.underline} (Nougayrède 2014). [Erdoğan's growing
**personal domination** has turned into an **authoritarian
populism**]{.underline}, especially [after the]{.underline} Gezi Park
protests and [transition from parliamentary to a **new presidential
system**, which allowed him to further **consolidate** his executive
powers]{.underline} (Özpek and Tanriverdi 2018; Castaldo 2018; Özen
2020; Cilliler 2021). The new presidential system enabled Erdoğan to
have a monopoly over the country's foreign policy and national security
matters[. His populist rhetoric has been characterized by
**nationalism** and **anti-Western** discourse]{.underline} where the
West, particularly [the **US**, is resituated as the
'**other'**]{.underline} (Kaliber and Kaliber 2019). Erdoğan seized
disproportionate power to shape the country's response to external
stimuli and the AKP's unofficial coalition partner, the far-right
Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi -- MHP) leader
Devlet Bahçeli. Both leaders' images and threat perceptions have been
based on an enemy image of Western countries.

[Russia **successfully took advantage**]{.underline} [of the increasing
tension between Turkey and the Western countries]{.underline}. During a
telephone conversation on a special occasion, both leaders, Russian
President Vladimir [Putin and]{.underline} Turkish President
[Erdoğan]{.underline}, [used the term]{.underline} '**[strategic
partnership']{.underline}** [to define Turkish-Russian bilateral
relations]{.underline} (Mercouris 2017), [which is quite
**significant**]{.underline}, [considering the term was also used to
define the **Turkish-American** relations]{.underline}. Turkish
policymakers have tried to respond to uncertainties of international
anarchy by seeking to shape regional developments in its favour by
establishing new alliances with Russia and Iran. One manifestation of
this was the result of the Astana peace talks. On 15 September 2017,
Russia, Turkey and Iran signed a deal to establish de-escalation zones
across Syria, including Syria's northwest province of Idlib.1 Turkish
authorities believed that this was another opportunity to break the
terror corridor, which was the term for YPG's three cantons in Northern
Syria established in 2014, located southern border of Turkey. The YPG
aimed to unite these cantons with Afrin canton to have geographical
unity. With the support of the US the YPG dominated SDF's capture of
Manbij in 2016 was further extended the corridor on the Turkish border
(Milliyet 2022). During the Idlib operation, Erdoğan pointed out Afrin
as the next stop. 'Operation Olive Branch' in Afrin was launched in
January 2018 as a response to the US decision to build new border
security with the SDF.

[As Turkey's security interest has been **long-ignored** by its Western
allies]{.underline}, [Turkish policymakers felt they were left with **no
option** but to cooperate with **non-NATO** countries]{.underline},
especially after the Obama administration blocked the sale of the
Patriot air missile defence system to Turkey. [These developments have
intensified **anti-Americanism**]{.underline} [in Turkey]{.underline}.
Turkish policy makers' desire to build an air defence structure pushed
them to seek other options, resulting in Turkey's deal with Russia to
purchase two Russian S--400 surface-to-air missile batteries to improve
Turkey's defence capabilities against threats from Kurdish and Islamist
militants across its borders in Syria and Iraq (BBC News 2017). Turkey's
strategic cooperation with Russia has become leverage to manage its
troubled relationship with the US. The Turkish-Russian rapprochement and
deepening defence cooperation were mainly the results of the US failure
to acknowledge Turkey's security concerns, its alliance with the YPG,
and the refusal to retrieve Gülen (Hale 2019; Kibaroğlu 2019). In
response to Turkey's S-400 purchase on 13 August 2018, the US Congress
approved a bill to limit the transfer of the F-35 aircraft to Turkey
(The US Senate 2018). Since 2002, Turkey has been a partner of the F-35
program both as a buyer and a production partner, has invested more than
\$1.4 billion in the program and planned to buy 100 of the fighter jets.
Turkey's S-400 deal was received negatively for two reasons. Firstly,
the system is not tolerable to NATO defence systems and would create a
weak spot in the defences, and secondly, it could threaten NATO secrets
by collecting information on NATO's next-generation fighter jet, the
F-35 (Asli 2019). Kathryn Wheelbarger, an acting assistant secretary of
defence, underlined that 'the S-400 is a Russian system designed to
shoot down an aircraft like the F-35' (Stewart and Pamuk 2019).
Therefore, the Western allies agreed that Turkey could not have both
S-400 and F-35. Although Erdoğan called the US officials several times
to establish a joint working group to resolve technical issues, his
calls remained unanswered.

[Turkey's **S-400** deal with Russia was also the main reason behind the
US's **economic warfare**]{.underline} [against Turkey]{.underline}.
After two-year detention, Turkey released the high-profile prisoner,
pastor Andrew Brunson, expecting Turkey's decision would decrease
tension with the US. In this sense, the US's initial decision to
withdraw from Syria in December 2018 was received positively by Ankara.
Next month, the US also offered to sell the Patriot missile systems to
Turkey with the condition that Turkey should cancel the purchase of the
S-400 systems. Turkish officials openly stated that it is a done deal
and there is no return, and Erdoğan questioned the Western attitudes and
pointed out that Greece has Russian S-300 as a NATO member, as well as
Slovakia and Bulgaria, yet complained about the Western position on
S-400s of Turkey.2 American withdrawal decision was later revised, and
1000 troops were left in Syria to avoid providing an opportunity for
ISIS to recover. [In return for Turkey's insistence on S-400s Turkish
**pilots' training**]{.underline} (for F-35 jets) [at the US have been
**suspended**]{.underline}, [their entrance to the **US bases** has been
**restricted**]{.underline}, and the US aligned with F-35 partners to
initiate Turkey's removal process from the F-35 stealth fighter program
(Ali and Stewart 2019). The US Senate introduced a bill that calls for
full implementation of sanctions under the Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and as well as to review the
NATO Treaty to consider the continued inclusion of Turkey in NATO.3
Despite the US warnings and threats of sanctions by Congress, the first
delivery of the parts of S-400s arrived in Turkey in July 2019. The
systemic pressure of security threats is the most crucial reason behind
the changing Turkish foreign policy behaviour, but only through the
mediating effect of unit-level variables. The elites' threat perception,
the strategic culture of increasing nationalism, and the strong
state-society relations increased the state's extraction capacity,
helped build domestic support for military operations in Syria, and
strengthened the country's defence capacity by acquiring the S-400
missile system from Russia.

With the surprise American pull-out decision in October 2019, the US
abandoned its primary ally, the SDF and the YPG. This enabled Turkey to
target the YPG without confronting the US, and the Turkish armed forces
launched the long-anticipated third major operation, 'Operation Peace
Spring', to target the SDF held territories and establish a safe zone,
145 kilometres in length and 30 kilometres in depth, in northern Syria
(Hurriyet Daily News 2019a). With this operation, Turkey eliminated the
establishment of a terror corridor in North-eastern Syria, pushed the
YPG back from the Turkish border, and had an opportunity to resettle
Syrian refugees in this zone. After the American withdrawal, Kurdish
militias had no choice but to make a deal with Russia and the Syrian
government to deploy the Syrian army along the border to repel the
Turkish assault (BBC News 2019a). This development has ended Syrian
Kurds' ambition to have an autonomous region and self-rule in Syria. In
Sochi, Erdoğan and Putin signed the 10-point memorandum plan to end the
Turkish offensive. Both countries agreed that Turkish forces would be
allowed to remain in the 120 km-long strip of territory (Ras al-Ain and
Tal Abyad) as a buffer zone against the YPG, Russian and Syrian troops
control the remaining border area, the retreat of the YPG from Turkey's
border, and establishing Turkish and Russian joint patrols to implement
agreed security mechanism along with Turkish-Syrian border (Aljazeera
2019). Turkey, Russia, and the Syrian regime simultaneously benefited
from Turkey's military operation and the Sochi agreement. Turkey
achieved to establish a safe zone to dismantle the YPG structure on its
border and forced the US to abandon Kurdish-led forces, Russia remained
the most pivotal player in Syria to determine the endgame in the Syrian
conflict, and the Assad regime regained control of the Kurdish
controlled areas in northeastern Syria.

By agreeing with the YPG, the Russian and Syrian regimes seized an
opportunity to implement the 1998 Adana Agreement on border security
between Turkey and Syria to re-establish the status quo. Therefore,
Turkey eventually will have no option but return to the Adana Accord.4
There are possible risks and adverse outcomes for Turkey's military
operations in Syria. Cook (2018) believes that with these operations,
Turkey could find itself in an irregular war in a foreign country with
Kurdish militias, who gained combat experience during their alliance
with the US. Based on Turkey's history of forty years of war with PKK,
it is likely that Turkey will be withdrawn to long term struggle against
guerrilla-like forces in Syria. Through military involvement, Turkey has
already signed up to govern the region, including managing various
issues ranging from security and education to health and delivering
water, which might be a problem to manage in the long run (Daragahi
2018).

Sterling and Folker (2002, 103) underline that states simultaneously
might see each other as valuable economic partners and security threats.
Therefore, 'cooperation and competition cannot be separated' (Doran
2010, 41). Turkey and Russia managed to separate economic cooperation
from geopolitical rivalries. This new flexible strategic alliance has
led to increased cooperation in various sectors while competing or
pursuing different interests in several regions/conflicts. According to
Faber, states' actions work compensatively, and 'a conflictual action in
one policy area is followed by cooperative action vis-à-vis the same
government in the same or another policy area' (1990, 309). The nature
of the current Turkish-Russian relationship has been characterized as
competitive cooperation. The two countries prefer different outcomes and
support opposing sides in the Syrian civil war while also having
divergent interests in other regions, including the Balkans, Caucasus,
MENA, and Central Asia. Yet, they were able to avoid direct
confrontation and accommodated each other's interests and expanded their
sphere of influence in these regions. However, Turkey remains on thin
ice in terms of regional competition with Russia, where things can
escalate quickly and unexpectedly in any of those regions. For instance,
in February 2020, dozens of Turkish soldiers were killed by the Russian
backed air strikes in Idlib. [After the American withdrawal, Russia
**controls the outcome** of the Syrian conflict]{.underline}. So
**[despite the risks]{.underline}**, [Turkey continues to **strengthen**
its **economic** and **defence** ties with Russia]{.underline}. [There
is also a growing **personal close relationship**]{.underline} [between
Erdoğan and Putin as Erdoğan is growing **more
authoritarian**]{.underline}. This is an opportunity for Russia to
include a NATO member in the anti-Western camp as much as possible.

[Turkish-Russian cooperation]{.underline} in Syria (facilitating Turkish
incursions in Syria) [has expanded cooperation in **other fields**,
including **economy**, **tourism**, **defence**, and **energy**
sectors]{.underline}. Besides the purchase of S-400s, [a Russian company
is building Turkey's first **nuclear plant**]{.underline} (Akkuyu
Nuclear Power Plant) [and two **pipelines** were
constructed]{.underline}, the Blue Stream and TurkStream, across the
Black Sea [to supply **natural gas** to Turkey]{.underline}. [While
Turkey is decreasing its reliance on the Western alliance due to its
**distrust**]{.underline} against the West relatively increasing its
dependence on Russia in terms of natural gas, trade, and technical
expertise in areas from defence to energy. Öniş and Yılmaz (2016)
identify Turkish-Russian relations and cooperation in Syria as
asymmetric interdependence in a turbulent region. [Turkey desires to
keep its ties with Russia as **leverage** against the US]{.underline}.
The AKP-MHP alliance plays a vital role in Turkey's military activism
and willingness to pursue more independent policies as well as to take
initiatives in the country's security and national interest in the
region. According to Military expenditures data from Stockholm

### 1NC\-\--AT: Turkey\-\--Mediation Turn

#### Turkey [mediates]{.underline} peace. However, by influencing Turkey and bolstering Ukraine, Russia says [no]{.underline}. [Nuclear]{.underline} war.

Russia's atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and its escalated
warfare in southeastern Ukraine have swept aside last month's public
discussion of peace options as the countries briefly held talks in
Turkey. Yet even in the darkest moments, all sides in this war,
including the United States and Europe, have strong interests in
maintaining channels for negotiation that can be used when opportunity
re-emerges. Protecting that interest means understanding and maintaining
Turkey's role in facilitating talks---and its potential to serve more
actively as a mediator.

By at least some norms of peace processes, Turkey is an atypical
mediator---but policymakers would do well to note strengths, not widely
recognized, that it can bring to this role. While analysts have
suggested China, Israel, India and others as possible mediators---and
while no options should be ignored---[Turkey has emerged as the **most
immediately useful**]{.underline} [go-between. It is **no accident**
that Turkey was Kyiv's and Moscow's]{.underline} **[preferred
choice]{.underline}** [for their brief attempts at
negotiations]{.underline} in March. By design, Turkey's role in those
talks was limited to facilitation, providing a secure space and
even-handed treatment of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, but without
injecting Turkish observations or proposals.

Particularly for Russia, Turkey can seem like an illogical choice as
mediator. It is not neutral between the combatants, but rather is a
member of NATO, which Russia's government has declared an enemy. Turkey
has supported Ukraine with humanitarian gestures, evacuating some 16,000
civilians from combat zones and receiving nearly 60,000 Ukrainian
refugees so far. It has even sold Turkish-built, armed, aerial drones
that Ukrainians have deployed against Russian ground offensives. Also,
Russia and Turkey have had their own conflicts, both historically and in
recent years.

Yet part of Turkey's utility as an interlocutor for Russia may be some
of these very qualities. Any eventual Russian-Ukrainian agreement will
need acceptance---and likely, reconstruction funds---from the United
States and Europe. [As a NATO member, Turkey can **offer influence**
with its U.S. and European allies in **securing that
support**]{.underline}. [Turkey has **built credibility** by developing
a **specific capacity** for mediation over recent decades, and by
showing itself to Russia and Ukraine as an **independent
actor**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, while a NATO member, [is not
**unduly influenced** by the United States or Europe]{.underline}. Even
now, with heightened battlefield violence and accusatory rhetoric from
both sides, [Turkey is continuing its **go-between role**]{.underline}.
[Its diplomats are continuing meetings with **both sides**]{.underline}
separately [and keeping **lines of communication** open]{.underline}.
[This creates an asset for]{.underline} managing, and hopefully
**[limiting]{.underline}**, [the conflict]{.underline}---one that
policymakers should not ignore.

Why Turkey Seeks the Middle

[Turkey is eager to play a mediating role in hopes of shortening a war
that threatens its vital **strategic** and **economic**
interests]{.underline}. If Russia succeeds in its offensive to seize the
southern Ukraine coastline, it will come close to restoring the
dominance over the Black Sea region that the Soviet Union wielded during
the Cold War. Such a resurgence in the power of Turkey's main historical
competitor in the Black Sea is a deeply discomfiting prospect for
Turkey's government.

President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan's government]{.underline} also [is eager
to prevent this war from vastly **multiplying** Turkey's existing
economic crisis]{.underline}, already the worst in 20 years, in
anticipation of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2023.
Erdogan's Justice and Development Party consolidated its rule beginning
in 2002 by leading Turkey out of its previous recession, but the COVID
pandemic and a stall in essential reforms have let inflation and debt
surge, and Turks' living standards decline.

A major economic burden for three decades has been Turkey's costs from
nearby wars---in Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Iraq and Syria. These costs
include disrupted trade and the flight to Turkey of an estimated 4
million refugees. The new war to Turkey's north will slash the foreign
tourism, more than a quarter of it from Russia and Ukraine, that brings
vital revenues. It could put at risk critical energy supplies, for
Turkey imports nearly half of its natural gas from Russia (and now
depends on gas more heavily with droughts that have cut hydropower
production). Also, Russia is building Turkey's first nuclear power plant
at Akkuyu, on Turkey's southern coast.

[Turkey's **Credibility** as an **Interlocutor**]{.underline}

[Turkey has consciously built a role for itself as a mediator in
conflicts over the past **two decades** and has been careful to
**sustain dialogue** with Russia]{.underline} despite the two countries'
often combative relations. [Turkey's former ambassador to
NATO]{.underline}, Tacan Ildem, [describes a \"**competitive
cooperation**]{.underline}\" [in which Turkey and Russia work, **issue
by issue**, on a **transactional basis**]{.underline}. This relationship
has let the countries manage their competing roles in conflicts from the
South Caucasus region to Libya and Syria. [They **modulated
crises**]{.underline} that arose in 2016, [after Turkish forces shot
down a Russian jet over Syria and the Russian ambassador in Ankara was
assassinated]{.underline}.

[The countries' relations **improved significantly**]{.underline} in the
past six years, [notably with Turkey\'s purchase of Russian
**S-400**]{.underline} air defense missiles [at the expense of
**strains** in its alliance with]{.underline} the United States and
[NATO]{.underline}. Presidents [Erdogan and]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin
have built a **rapport**]{.underline}, [especially following **Putin's
support** for Erdogan in the wake of the]{.underline} July 2016 **[coup
attempt]{.underline}** in Turkey. [The Turkish-Russian successes in
practicing "**controlled tension**]{.underline}" [are part of the reason
that]{.underline} Ukrainian President Volodymyr [Zelenskyy sought
Turkey\'s help with Russia]{.underline} even **[before]{.underline}**
[Moscow's]{.underline} re-[launch of its war in February]{.underline}.

[Ever since Russia's first attack on Ukraine in 2014]{.underline}---its
seizure of Crimea and its thinly veiled assault in the southern Donbas
region---[Turkey has played both **public** and **secret** roles as a
go-between]{.underline}. Since that year, [it has been **Turkish
diplomats** who headed the main **international diplomatic mission** in
the conflict]{.underline}---that of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In that role, [two successive Turkish
ambassadors led the arduous daily work of **reducing conflicts** and
**facilitating communication**]{.underline} between Ukraine's government
and the Russian-backed separatist forces in southernmost Donbas. Turkish
officials also have assisted other exchanges between Russia and Ukraine
during the eight long years of the war, keeping that role extremely
discreet to avoid having it be seen as competing with the OSCE-backed
Minsk peace process.

In its Russia-Ukraine efforts, Turkey is building on a foundation that
it consciously laid over the past two decades. Turkey became what one
senior Turkish diplomat has called a "policy entrepreneur," advocating
greater global use of mediation as a conflict resolution method, notably
by the United Nations and OSCE. Within its own region, Turkey has
mediated since 2000 between Israel and Palestinians, Israel and Syria,
fighting factions in Lebanon and in Iraq, and between Bosnia-Herzegovina
and Serbia. Turkey also facilitated talks between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, and between Somalia and the breakaway region of Somaliland.
While this priority on mediation has receded with changes to Turkish
foreign policy since 2016, Turkey's experience over the past two decades
has become useful for its Ukraine-Russia role.

Sustaining Turkey's Potential for Peacemaking

The United States and Europe can help Turkey sustain its usefulness as a
mediator as the Turkish government confronts three specific challenges.
One is how to handle the unprecedented global campaign of economic
sanctions against Russia[. Turkey traditionally has **adhered** only to
sanctions regimes approved by the **United Nations**, declining to apply
sanctions imposed by individual states or **coalitions**]{.underline}.
Turkey has imposed two specific sanctions of its own, focused on
Russia's military. In February, the Turkish government invoked the 1936
Montreux Convention to close the Bosporus Straits to military ships
during wartime, preventing Russia from reinforcing its Black Sea fleet.
Last week it announced a three-month closure of its airspace to Russian
warplanes or troop transports flying to Syria.

[If policymakers]{.underline} are inclined to [**press** Turkey to
tighten its adherence to sanctions, they should consider whether such a
step might be **low in value** but **high in cost**]{.underline}.
[Turkey's exports to Russia are largely]{.underline} fruit, fabrics and
[**light** industrial goods]{.underline}, [rather than **strategic
products** or **materials**]{.underline}. [Yet forcing Turkey to impose
fuller sanctions could **close** the world's **clearest communication
channel**]{.underline} [for a]{.underline}n eventual **[negotiated
solution]{.underline}**.

[Sustaining a Turkish channel for peacemaking also means remaining open
to the **options for settlement**]{.underline}---[a preference that
Ukraine has signaled]{.underline}, even amid the recent discoveries of
Russian atrocities. Many observers have noted the risks of [any policy
notion that would aim to **weaken** Russia by letting it bleed in a
**long conflict**]{.underline}---[a huge multiplication of the costs to
Ukraine and the risks of **escalation**, including **nuclear
warfare**]{.underline}. [A further cost would be the ability of
Turkey]{.underline}, or any mediator, [to help limit such an
**unpredictable**, **longer** or **wider** war]{.underline}.

### 1NC\-\--AT: Turkey\-\--Transactionalism Bad

#### Transactionalism [exacerbates]{.underline} future disputes.

KL\]

Second, while it is wise to spare the Strategic Mechanism of the burden
of pointedly focusing on bilateral disagreements, assuming these matters
can simply be set aside would be a mistake. The poisonous seeping
effects of the problems weighing down the relationship do not afford the
luxury of time. [That is the **underlying risk**]{.underline}
[associated with]{.underline} seemingly [practical solutions like
embracing **transactionalism**]{.underline}, [attempting
**compartmentalization**]{.underline}, [and focusing on **low-hanging
fruit**]{.underline} [while leaving problems on the **back
burner**]{.underline}. [Such an attempt would mean
**sleepwalking**]{.underline} [toward a future in which current problems
will probably become more **ossified**]{.underline} [and solutions will
be **harder to find**]{.underline}. Despite such risks, Washington seems
more inclined to wait things out, mostly because of its reluctance to
engage in a process that is limited to rehashing arguments that have
already been made to no effect. Turkey, on the other hand, seems ready
to continue the debate, no matter what. The gap that needs to be bridged
here involves identifying new common ground to move on. That is the
incentive both sides need, and in Washington's case, it is seen as a
prerequisite. But the onus to create these conditions cannot fall on one
side alone. It must be a mutual endeavor.

### 1NC\-\--AT: Taiwan

#### No Taiwan invasion. It's [all talk]{.underline} and no action. 

**Wong 22** \[[Tessa Wong]{.underline}, BBC reporter citing [William
Choong]{.underline}, senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian
Studies, and [Collin Koh]{.underline}, research fellow with the S
Rajaratnam School of International Studies; 6-14-2022; \"Taiwan: Are the
US and China heading to war over the island?\"; BBC News;
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61782370; KL\]

One major fear is that war would be triggered if China invades Taiwan.
Beijing has said in the past it could reclaim the island by force if
necessary.

But most [**analysts** say this is **not likely**]{.underline} - for
now.

There has been debate over whether China has the military capability to
succeed in an invasion, and Taiwan has been considerably ramping up its
air and sea defences.

But many agree that [Beijing recognises that such a move would be **too
costly** and **disastrous**]{.underline} - not only for China, but also
for the world.

\"[There\'s a lot of **rhetoric**]{.underline}, [but the Chinese have to
**mind the gap** very carefully if they want to launch an invasion of
Taiwan, especially so close to the **Ukraine crisis**]{.underline}. [The
Chinese economy is **far more interconnected**]{.underline} [with the
global economy than Russia\'s is]{.underline},\" says **[William
Choong]{.underline}**, [senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast
Asian Studies]{.underline}.

What does China want from the Ukraine crisis?

[China\'s consistent position has been that it seeks]{.underline}
\"**[peaceful reunification]{.underline}**\" with Taiwan - something
that Gen Wei reiterated on Sunday - and that [it would only act if faced
with a **provocation**]{.underline}.

One trigger would likely be Taiwan formally declaring independence. But
this is something that its President Tsai Ing-wen has strenuously
avoided, even as she insists they are already a sovereign state.

[Most Taiwanese support this position, which is known as]{.underline}
\"**[maintaining the status quo]{.underline}**\", though increasingly a
small number say they want to move toward independence.

Similarly, [the US would be **reluctant** to be drawn into a costly
military conflict in Asia, and has **signalled repeatedly** that they
**do not want war**.]{.underline}

US Defence Secretary **[Lloyd Austin]{.underline}**, who also attended
the Dialogue, [said]{.underline} in his speech that [the US **does not
support** Taiwan independence, nor does it want]{.underline} \"[a new
Cold War]{.underline}\".

\"Both sides are sticking to their guns on Taiwan. They need to look
tough, they don\'t want to be seen as rolling back or stepping back,\"
said **[Collin Koh]{.underline}**, [research fellow with the S
Rajaratnam School of International Studies]{.underline}.

\"But at the same time they are very mindful about entering an outright
conflict. They\'re looking at each other\'s rhetoric with eyes wide
open, and both sides are trying to temper the risk.\"

The fact that both [Gen Wei and]{.underline} Mr [Austin met at the
sidelines]{.underline} of the Shangri-la Dialogue was a positive sign,
as [it meant that both sides wanted to show]{.underline} \"[they
are]{.underline} still [willing to **sit down** and **talk it out**,
come to a **consensus**, and agree to disagree]{.underline},\" said Mr
Koh.

[This]{.underline}, he said, [would likely lead to more **operational
discussions**]{.underline} [between the two militaries that would
**reduce** the possibility of on-the-ground
**miscalculations**]{.underline} that could lead to a conflict, [and an
overall]{.underline} \"**[reinvigoration of dialogue]{.underline}**\"
that was missing during Donald Trump\'s administration.

#### China's playing the [long game]{.underline}.

**Nathan 22** \[Andrew J. Nathan; Class of 1919 Professor of Political
Science at Columbia University; 6-23-2022; \"Beijing Is Still Playing
the Long Game on Taiwan\"; Foreign Affairs;
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-06-23/beijing-still-playing-long-game-taiwan;
KL\]

Concern is growing in Taiwan, in the United States, and among U.S.
allies in Asia that China is preparing to attack Taiwan in the near
future. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee last
year, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the commander of the U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, warned that Beijing might attempt to seize the
island in the next six years. Unifying Taiwan with mainland China is a
key element of Chinese President Xi Jinping's "Chinese dream." And as
the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro has argued in these pages,
Xi wants "unification with Taiwan to be part of his personal legacy,"
suggesting that an armed invasion could come before the end of his third
term as secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027 and
almost certainly before the end of his probable fourth term in 2032.

Putin's war in Ukraine has intensified these concerns. Xi's announcement
just before the Russian invasion of a "no limits" partnership with
Moscow, coupled with his failure to condemn Putin's actions and the
Chinese media's endorsement of Russian propaganda, seem to signal
Beijing's support for Russia's territorial aggression. Beijing may see a
strategic opening now that U.S. political and military resources are
tied up in Europe. Moreover, Chinese leaders may have interpreted the
West's response to the Russian attack as an indication that the United
States will not intervene militarily to defend a country to which it is
not bound by a defense treaty, especially against a nuclear-armed
adversary. As David Sacks of the Council on Foreign Relations has
argued, "Chinese policymakers may conclude that Russia's nuclear arsenal
effectively deterred the United States, which would be unwilling to go
to war with a nuclear power over Taiwan."

But [fears of an imminent Chinese attack are **misplaced**]{.underline}.
[For **decades**, China's policy toward Taiwan has been characterized by
**strategic patience**]{.underline}, [as has its approach to other
territorial claims and disputes]{.underline}---[from **India** to the
**S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}. [Far from spurring
China]{.underline} to jettison this approach in favor of an imminent
military assault on Taiwan, [the war in Ukraine will **reinforce**
Beijing's commitment to playing the **long game**]{.underline}. [The
price Moscow has paid]{.underline}, both militarily and in the form of
international isolation, [is but a fraction of what China could
expect]{.underline} if it were to attempt to take Taiwan by force.
[Better to **wait patiently** for Taiwan's eventual
surrender]{.underline}, as Beijing sees it, [than to strike now and risk
winning]{.underline} the island [at **too high** a
cost]{.underline}---[or **losing it forever**]{.underline}.

IMPENDING ATTACK?

Fear that China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin
invaded Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a
2021 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests.

In 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan
to normalize relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of
winning over Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically
isolated, militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on
the mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party.

But these efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against
unification in Taiwanese public opinion and politics. According to
opinion polls, the share of Taiwanese voters favoring unification fell
from 28 percent in 1999 to less than two percent in 2022. An
overwhelming majority favor "maintaining the status quo," which in the
language of Taiwanese politics means sustaining autonomy without
formally declaring independence. Since 2016, the anti-unification
Democratic Progressive Party has controlled both the presidency and the
legislature, and it looks well positioned to win the next set of
national elections in 2024.

Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced.

These trends have prompted China to adopt a more threatening posture
toward Taiwan. Beijing has stepped up measures to isolate the island
diplomatically, slowed imports and the tourist trade, trained the
Chinese military to conduct the complicated joint operations necessary
for a cross-strait invasion, and conducted frequent probes of Taiwan's
air defense identification zone. China has also developed what the
Pentagon calls "anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including
long-range precision missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship
ballistic missiles, cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to
hold at bay a U.S. defense of Taiwan.

These moves have fed speculation that China is building up to a
full-scale attack. In addition to Xi's desire to secure his legacy, the
shifting balance of power between China and the United States is often
cited by U.S. analysts as a possible motivation for Xi. The scholars
Michael Beckley and Hal Brands, for instance, have suggested that China
may attack in the near term because it has reached the peak of its
national strength---and China's leaders know it. China is looking at a
period of decline caused by a combination of unsustainable debt, rising
labor costs, an aging population, declining productivity, and a critical
water shortage. Meanwhile, the United States and Taiwan have recently
started to readjust their military postures to counter the asymmetric
threat China poses. The Biden administration is pulling Japan and South
Korea together around a commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait,"
and Western businesses are gradually moving their production sites out
of China because of rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in
the Chinese market, and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation
gathers steam, the West's economic incentives to avoid war with China
will diminish. By this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its
adversaries are ready.

WAITING GAME

[The facts on which such forecasts are based]{.underline} are not wrong,
but they [are **incomplete**]{.underline}. [A **fuller set** of facts
suggests that China is still pursuing a strategy of **strategic
patience**]{.underline} when it comes to Taiwan. First, [Chinese
leaders]{.underline}---rightly or wrongly---[seem **confident** that
they can handle their own problems **better** than the West can handle
its problems]{.underline}. They don't deny the challenges that Beckley
and Brands highlight, but [they believe the West is **in
decline**]{.underline}, [hobbled by **ill-managed** and **slow-growing
economies**]{.underline}, **[social divisions]{.underline}**, [and
**weak political leaders**]{.underline}. However, [Chinese strategists
**do not** seem to believe that China has yet reached a **favorable
power balance**]{.underline} [with the West]{.underline}. As Yan
Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua
University, has argued, "[China's global reach still has its
**limits**]{.underline}. Despite being a major power,
[China]{.underline} also [thinks of itself as a **developing
country**]{.underline}---and rightly so, [considering that its GDP per
capita remains **far behind**]{.underline} [those of advanced
economies]{.underline}."

[Beijing can **afford to wait** for power in the Western Pacific to
**tip decisively** in its favor]{.underline}. When Washington comes to
understand that the cost of defending Taiwan is beyond its means, and
Taiwanese officials realize that Washington no longer has the appetite
for a clash with China, [Taiwan will **pragmatically negotiate** an
arrangement that Beijing can accept]{.underline}. [In the meantime,
China needs only to **deter** Taipei and Washington from attempting to
lock in **formal** Taiwanese independence]{.underline}. [Beijing's shows
of force are **not precursors** of an imminent attack]{.underline},
therefore, [but measures intended to **buy time**]{.underline} for
history to take its course.

Second, [**contrary** to the **common portrayal**]{.underline} [of China
as **itching** for war]{.underline}, [Beijing has demonstrated
**strategic patience** in pursuit of its **other goals**]{.underline}. A
good example is Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea, where China
has built and militarized seven sand islands without triggering a war
with the United States or rival territorial claimants. It did so by
building only on landforms it already controlled, claiming all along
that it wasn't doing what it was doing. The rival territorial claimants
were too weak to confront China, while the United States lacked a
justification for doing so because it has no territorial claims where
China was building. Beijing restricted access to but refrained from
seizing a landform it contests with the sole U.S. treaty ally involved
in these disputes---the Philippines---which in any case lacked an
appetite to invoke its alliance with Washington by moving militarily to
defend itself.

The conflict in Ukraine is reminding Xi that war is unpredictable and
rule over a resisting population is costly.

China likewise changed the strategic status quo without triggering an
armed conflict over the contested Senkaku Islands, known in China as the
Diaoyu Islands, by escalating from an occasional maritime presence in
Japanese waters to a permanent one, supplementing its naval forces with
less confrontational coast guard, maritime militia, and fishing vessels.
Beijing followed a similar playbook in the contested Ladakh region of
India, where Chinese troops gradually advanced their positions and
established a series of new lines of control with only one confirmed
outbreak of shooting that was quickly contained.

China has invested in ostensibly civilian port projects across the
Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as foundations for future naval
operations, raising some alarm but no counteraction. Beijing has also
used its economic and diplomatic influence in Africa, Europe, Latin
America, the Middle East, and Oceania and its norm-setting power in
international institutions to incentivize governments to align with
China's interests, again generating some alarm but no effective
resistance. Such diplomatic, economic, and military "gray zone tactics"
illustrate that China's strategic behavior is geared toward the long
term rather than the short term, moving from no presence to sustained
presence in a host of arenas without generating substantial pushback,
much less armed conflict (with the exception of the fighting in Ladakh).
That same strategic caution has so far been evident in China's policy
toward Taiwan, where Beijing has dialed up tension and deterred a
Taiwanese drive for independence without precipitating a crisis.

Finally, [the lesson Xi is]{.underline} likely [drawing from Putin's war
in Ukraine is **not** that territorial aggression would go
unpunished]{.underline} militarily by the West [but that it would be
both **difficult**]{.underline} [and **costly**]{.underline}. [There is
**no reason** to believe that Xi is surrounded, as **Putin** seems to
be,]{.underline} [by **yes men**]{.underline} [who will tell him that a
war]{.underline} over Taiwan [can be easily won]{.underline}. Even if he
is, however, [the **grinding conflict** in **Ukraine** is reminding him
that war is **unpredictable**]{.underline} [and rule over a **resisting
population** is **costly**]{.underline}. [The amphibious operation China
would need to undertake to seize Taiwan would be **far more difficult**
than the land invasion Russia has carried out in Ukraine]{.underline}.
Xi has been reforming the Chinese military's command structure and
ramping up training for such an operation, but [Chinese forces remain
**untested** in actual combat operations]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
chances that the United States would intervene to defend Taiwan have
increased as anti-Chinese sentiment has risen in the United States and
Europe---and after U.S. President Joe Biden remarked last month that
defending Taiwan is "the commitment we made."

[Even if Beijing could win a war over Taiwan, it is **unclear** that it
could win what would **come next**]{.underline}. [As painful as Russia's
isolation]{.underline} from Western economies [has been]{.underline} for
Moscow, [the postwar scenario for the Chinese economy would be **even
more damaging**]{.underline}. [China imports **70 percent**]{.underline}
[of its **oil**]{.underline} and 31 percent of its natural gas; it is
the world's largest coal producer but still needs to import more.
Although it is striving for food self-sufficiency, [China is the world's
**largest importer** of food]{.underline}, especially corn, meat,
seafood, and soybeans. Some of these energy and food imports come from
Russia, but [many come from countries that would **sanction
China**]{.underline} [if it invaded Taiwan]{.underline}. [And even if
they did not, China's navy doesn't have the global reach to defend the
**shipping routes**]{.underline} across which these and many other vital
commodities flow. [Any war over Taiwan, even a successful
one]{.underline} for Beijing, [would deal a **devastating
blow**]{.underline} [to the Chinese economy, creating conditions that
would **threaten** domestic **political stability**]{.underline} [and
usher in the **failure**]{.underline}, not the realization, [of the
Chinese dream]{.underline}.

The Biden administration recently approved its first arms sale to Taiwan
for \$750 million worth of howitzers and high-tech munitions kits.
Proponents incorrectly argue that this sale will enhance stability in
the region by sending a strong signal to China of America's commitment
to Taiwan's security and by complicating any Chinese plans for an
invasion of the island. In fact, the sale will accomplish nothing of the
sort. [To **avoid enflaming tensions** in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S.
needs to **halt sales** of weapons to Taiwan]{.underline}.

[This sale will not allow Taiwan to better defend itself]{.underline} in
any clash with China. [It will]{.underline}, however, [tell Taiwan that
it's OK to keep **passing the buck**]{.underline} [to the United States
for its defense]{.underline}. Moreover, [a new sale of arms at this time
is sure to **inflame tensions**]{.underline} [between Beijing and
Washington, increasing the **risk of conflict**]{.underline} [and making
it more difficult to **make progress**]{.underline} [on issues of
**mutual concern**]{.underline}, [such as **climate
change**]{.underline}, **[trade]{.underline}** [and nuclear
**nonproliferation**]{.underline}.

[No matter how many]{.underline} tanks, planes,
**[missiles]{.underline}** or howitzers Taiwan buys from the United
[States, **few experts** seriously believe that Taiwan is capable of
defending itself **on its own**]{.underline}. [Though a Chinese invasion
of Taiwan would be costly]{.underline}, absent a war between China and
the U.S., [Taiwan would **surely succumb**]{.underline}.

[Beyond its obvious **manpower advantages**]{.underline}, [China also
enjoys **overwhelming air** and **naval superiority**]{.underline} [that
U.S. arms sales alone **cannot reverse**]{.underline}. [China can
**blockade** the island nation, airlift **full-scale battle
tanks**]{.underline} [onto the island and **overpower** Taiwan's air
defense systems]{.underline}. [A few more]{.underline} guns,
[missiles]{.underline} and planes [cannot change this]{.underline}.

Despite inaccurate claims that weapons are helping Taiwan become capable
of defending itself, [**decades** of American arms sales and
reassurances have convinced Taiwanese leaders that the United States is
**ultimately responsible**]{.underline} [for Taiwan's
security]{.underline}. [Taiwan's defense spending has **remained stuck**
at about 2 percent of its gross domestic product]{.underline} for years,
a great deal of which it has spent on high-tech American weapons that
will be of little value in case of a war.

According to a report published by George Mason University for which the
authors interviewed Taiwanese military officials, senior lawmakers,
elected leaders, former government officials and defense scholars, the
U.S. arms sales let "China know America would intervene on our behalf in
a conflict."

In short, when it buys American weapons, Taiwan is simply making
insurance payments to guarantee American intervention in response to a
Chinese invasion.

But while [arms sales]{.underline} may have reassured Taiwan of ultimate
U.S. reassurance, they [have also **angered** and **alienated**
Beijing]{.underline}. [After the United States recognized mainland
China]{.underline} in 1979, [it pledged to **refrain** from selling the
Taiwanese offensive weaponry]{.underline}. [But advanced]{.underline}
fighter jets, [missiles]{.underline} and planes [are hardly purely
defensive]{.underline}. Ironically, President Joe Biden used to
understand this. In 1999, then-Sen. Biden stated that mandating arms
sales to Taiwan would "be the equivalent of waving a red cape in front
of Beijing."

[**China's concern** over these **increasingly sophisticated** weapons
sales is **understandable**]{.underline}. From President Barack Obama's
2011 "pivot to Asia" to President Donald Trump's trade war, American
concerns over a rising China have clearly been growing. In addition to
selling Taiwan increasingly sophisticated weaponry, the Pentagon is
deploying additional ships and planes in the areas surrounding China.
Not surprisingly, [Chinese leaders **worry** that the U.S. and its
allies are reviving the Cold War strategy of **encircling**]{.underline}
[their adversaries]{.underline}.

[Attempts to deter China with an enhanced]{.underline} U.S. military
presence and [arms sales to Taiwan are having the **opposite
effect**]{.underline}. [China's defense budget has
**doubled**]{.underline} [in the 10 years since Obama announced the
pivot.]{.underline} [China is also **matching**]{.underline} increased
U.S. air and naval deployments [with **more aggressive**
maneuvers]{.underline} of its own. Over the summer, [China flew **record
numbers** of warplanes]{.underline} through Taiwan-controlled airspace.
And [in response to this latest sale,]{.underline} [China once again
declared it would take **countermeasures**]{.underline}.

[**Greater** American]{.underline} military involvement and [arms sales
in the region raises the risk of a **conflict**]{.underline} [breaking
out over Taiwan that **drags the United States**]{.underline} [into a
war with **China**]{.underline} --- [a war that would surely result in
**widespread death**]{.underline} [and **destruction** on all
sides]{.underline}. Taiwan is in an unenviable position, but [defending
Taiwan at the risk of war with China is a **bad gamble**]{.underline}
for both Taipei and Washington to take, especially as Taiwan would
almost certainly be reduced to cinders in the process.

Provoking China via arms sales also narrows the already constricted
space in which the world's most powerful nations can make progress on
international trade, climate change and other global concerns. Both
[U.S. and Taiwanese security would be **best served**]{.underline} in a
world [where the U.S. and China **avoided** provocative military actions
and sought **openings for cooperation** on issues of **mutual
benefit**]{.underline}.

#### Invasion is [likely now]{.underline} because of [aggressive]{.underline} American actions.

US and China heading to war over the island?\"; BBC News;
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61782370; KL\]

Weeks after the US president warned China over Taiwan, [Beijing has
delivered its **sternest rebuttal** yet]{.underline}, [saying it would
\"**resolutely crush any attempt**]{.underline}\" [at Taiwan\'s
independence]{.underline}.

On Sunday, [China\'s Defence Minister General]{.underline} Wei Fenghe
essentially **[accused]{.underline}** [the US of **supporting** the
island\'s independence, saying it was \"**violating its promise** on
Taiwan]{.underline}\" [and \"**interfering**]{.underline}\" [in China\'s
affairs]{.underline}.

\"Let me make this clear: if anyone dares to secede Taiwan from
[China]{.underline}, we [**will not hesitate** to fight]{.underline}.
[We will fight at **all costs** and we will fight to the **very
end**]{.underline}. [This is the **only choice** for
China,\"]{.underline} he said at the Shangri-la Dialogue, an Asian
security summit held in Singapore.

His comments follow US President Joe [Biden]{.underline}\'s recent
message to China that it was \"flirting with danger\" by flying its
warplanes close to Taiwan. He [**vowed** to protect the island
militarily if it was attacked]{.underline}.

Taiwan, which considers itself a sovereign nation, has long been claimed
by China. But Taiwan also counts the US as its biggest ally, and
Washington has a law which requires it to help the island defend itself.

[The escalation in rhetoric comes as China **increasingly sends
warplanes** into Taiwan\'s air defence zone]{.underline} - flying their
largest sortie of the year just last month - [while the US has sent
**naval ships** through Taiwan\'s waters]{.underline}.

The [conversations at the two-day NATO Public Forum]{.underline}, taking

Islamabad : [There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and what
are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict. These
thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline} South Asia and
[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace Studies
(PIPS]{.underline}), an Islamabad-based think tank, [[participated by
**prominent**]{.mark} **national and [international
scholars]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Prof]{.underline}. Shahram [Akbarzadeh]{.underline}, Deakin University,
Australia, [[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in the literature
on non-state actors]{.underline}. He called for empirical research,
along with concrete policy suggestions, on the topic, so as to mitigate
the conflicts in the region, in particular South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said [non-state actors often evoke memories
of violent elements]{.underline}. This despite that as per definition,
non-state actors include organizations working for human rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted [[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}.

Participants noted over the decades, [much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim [Fraihat]{.underline}, Doha Institute of Graduate Studies,
Doha, [termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two parties, though
one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}. This way, [domestic
conflicts are escalated by external power intervention]{.underline}. At
the same time, proxy war, if unresolved, can take the shape of
conventional war, the most significant example was of Vietnam War. [[In
contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}, he lamented, [[the Middle East
has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East. Dr.
Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for Research
and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors involved in
Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the region. It was
said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states achieve their
interests. Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University
Islamabad focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's
involvement in Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with
Kabul reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India
strategic cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

[Dr]{.underline}. Muhammad Riaz [Shad]{.underline}, National University
of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting through proxies
gives states an opportunity of deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### No war---Iran and Israel are both risk averse, which limits likelihood of escalation

**Miller, 15** -- vice president for new initiatives and a distinguished
scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Aaron
David, 7/24. "Why War Isn't Inevitable If Congress Rejects the Iran
Nuclear Deal."
http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/24/why-war-isnt-inevitable-if-congress-rejects-iran-nuclear-deal/

Why go to war? [The theory that [conflict with Iran]{.mark} is
inevitable [rests on]{.mark}]{.underline} several [[**highly arguable**
contentions.]{.mark} First is [the assumption that Iran is willing
to]{.mark}]{.underline} accelerate its nuclear program and to either
break out or sneak out to a weapon and thus [[court a military response
from Israel or the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. The second big
assumption is [that Israel is]{.mark} just [itching for an opportunity
to unilaterally strike]{.mark} Iran with or without Washington's
approval]{.underline}. In the wake of a no vote by Congress,
[[**neither** of these]{.mark} developments [are
certainties]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel is implacably opposed to the
deal, but Prime Minister Benjamin [[Netanyahu is]{.underline}]{.mark}
pretty [**[risk-averse]{.mark}**;]{.underline} he would have to think
long and hard about launching strike in which [[Israel is **operating at
the margins of its capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly without
a reason that would justify the severe international consequences.

And why would Iran want to provide such a reason as long as it could
play the Security Council card and pocket the political and economic
benefits that would flow from being cooperative? [[For Tehran, the
smarter option]{.underline}]{.mark} in the wake of Congress blocking the
accord [[would be to **exploit**]{.mark} **the appetite for
[international investment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and pick up as many
chits as possible on the global stage by blaming the failure and missed
opportunity on Washington. This isn't a perfect outcome, but it's [a
**[more compelling]{.mark}** choice for Iran's leadership [than]{.mark}
a headlong plunge into [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That course stands to
bring Iran few benefits and many risks. Tehran is also aware that its
ally [Hezbollah is **bogged down** in Syria]{.mark} as part of Iran's
campaign to support]{.underline} Bashar al-Assad, [[which **limits
Tehran's regional assets**]{.mark} to use against Israel in the event of
a military strike]{.underline}. If Congress blocks the nuclear
agreement, [the mullahs will]{.underline} take their time and [consider
all of Iran's options. Courting a major strike from Israel and the U.S.
isn't necessarily one of them]{.underline}.

Why do you think it is taking so long to deliver the weapon systems?

Very often [a highly technological, highly precise weapons will contain
subsystems from multiple countries]{.underline}. And [if they were to
transfer that technology, they will need to have permissions from all
those countries.]{.underline}

And the other component is that, unfortunately, [not all politicians

believe that this is not their war]{.underline}. This war is so far away
it doesn't concern them. But in reality, this is a war for the entire
