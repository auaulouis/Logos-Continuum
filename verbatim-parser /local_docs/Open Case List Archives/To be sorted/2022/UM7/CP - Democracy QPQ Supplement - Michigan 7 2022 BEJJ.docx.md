#### **[Unconditional]{.underline} security assistance fails -- it rewards [bad behavior]{.underline} and is treated as [entitlement]{.underline}**

The United States has made security assistance and security cooperation
a centerpiece of its global engagement. Security, U.S. leaders often
argue, should come first in coping with such challenges as terrorism and
insurgencies. However, [U.S. security assistance programs **routinely
fail** to achieve their goals, in part because they are too small,
**reward "bad behavior**," are **treated as an entitlement** and, most
importantly, do not recognize the critical link between security and
governance.]{.underline}

PATHOLOGIES

There are four major deficiencies in U.S. security sector assistance:

[Small amounts of assistance go to too many countries to make a
difference or provide leverage]{.underline}. The U.S. State Department's
FY2016 budget provides \$8 billion for the security sectors of over 130
countries. More than three quarters of these funds are "earmarked" for
Israel, Egypt, Colombia, and Jordan and half of the remaining countries
receive roughly \$2 million each.

[Programs throw good money after bad, rewarding "bad behavior,"
including corruption and coups. This is especially true for assistance
to some of the world's most poorly governed countries.]{.underline} The
target should be states that can actually achieve positive results with
U.S. funding.

[Too many countries treat our assistance as an entitlement]{.underline}.
Over the last decade, the overwhelming majority of [countries receiving
foreign military financing (FMF) were **allocated roughly the same
amount of funds each year**, regardless of security sector performance
or security outcomes]{.underline}. Moral hazard results: [If a
government receives funds regardless of performance, it has little
incentive to seek results.]{.underline}

[The measurements the United States makes of country performance and
results **focus on inputs, not outcomes**.]{.underline} Over the past
several years, [according to the Fund for Peace, the security scores of
almost all recipients of U.S. security assistance worsened]{.underline}
slightly from what they had been before the investments started.

A NEW PARADIGM

Fundamentally, [U.S. security assistance programs promote failure by
putting the security cart before the governance horse]{.underline};
however, as a growing body of research suggests, "governance before
security," should drive U.S. policy.

To realign U.S. security assistance programs more closely with
governance objectives, U.S. officials can take a lesson from the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). [MCC assistance is more
**selective and conditional** than traditional assistance. It requires
potential recipients to measure up to 16 indicators of good governance
before they are eligible for an MCC "compact."]{.underline}

Because [MCC funds are limited and the program is highly
selective]{.underline}, prospective MCC partners are, in effect,
challenged to compete for funding with other countries on the basis of
governance performance. Once countries sign a compact, [the MCC applies
**stringent performance and evaluation controls** to monitor and hold
MCC partners accountable for results.]{.underline} Poor country
performance in meeting commitments under their compacts can and has been
penalized by the termination of the compact. In sum, MCC countries are
incentivized to improve their policy performance to meet standards that
both improve governance and advance U.S. national objectives.

The [MCC experience offers a useful model for U.S. security assistance
programs.]{.underline} Broader governance criteria, as well as criteria
specifically related to security sector behavior, would determine the
initial eligibility of countries for assistance. The United States would
establish a "challenge fund" consisting of the bulk of U.S. security
assistance funds for which potential recipient countries could compete.
To be successful, the stewards of this fund would need to establish
stringent performance standards both for overall governance and security
sector performance competing countries would have to meet before they
are declared eligible and selected for participation in the fund. For
example, [governments should]{.underline}:

- Be committed to civilian-led accountable institutions and have a
  military that only acts under civilian command and with clear and
  transparent rules of engagement;

- Make military/security capabilities, budget data, and weapons
  procurement transparent to civilian authorities and not allow the
  military to own productive resources in the civilian economy;

- [Require military/security **training to include human rights**,
  accountability to civilians and civilian institutions, and adherence
  to rule of law and prohibit military/security forces from detaining
  individuals indefinitely or without trial]{.underline};

- Have defense and interior ministries headed by civilians appointed
  through an accountable process, with low measures of corruption, as
  MCC uses;

- Have legislatures with capacity for effective oversight of
  military/security ministries and with budget/appropriations role for
  these budgets;

- Have a free press allowed to scrutinize and report on military and
  security force budgets and activities without repression;

- Have clear rules of engagement for dealing with internal unrest that
  meet international standards and do not use military/security forces
  for internal political repression; and

- [Make an adequate investment of resources for training in the areas of
  democratic and community-oriented policing]{.underline} and have an
  investigatory framework that does not rely on torture and forced
  confession.

#### The AFF fails to reconcile [policy disagreements]{.underline} that [conditions solve]{.underline} -- especially with [authoritarian]{.underline} allies

- Could also be used for turns case?

[The complexity of global challenges ranging from **China, Russia, Iran,
and North Korea** to transnational **terrorism**, **w**eapons of
**m**ass **d**estruction **proliferation**, and **cyber threats** will
require the United States to partner with countries around the world to
achieve common security objectives.]{.underline} In support of this
approach, partners will require assistance from the United States in
building the capacity and capabilities of their security forces and to
improve interoperability with U.S. forces. However, inevitably,
[**policy disagreements** and **clashing interests** will arise between
the United States and its security partners, and the United States will
have to find ways to reconcile its security objectives and its broader
foreign policy goals. Smart and strategic use of conditions on security
assistance, when the United States has leverage in a security
relationship, may **help close these policy gaps**.]{.underline}
Assessing donor and recipient vulnerability at the front end of U.S.
policy deliberations can help calculate leverage and determine the right
kind of conditions that should be applied[. Smarter use of conditions
will not completely resolve the tensions in U.S. foreign policy,
particularly when it comes to **dealing with authoritarian regimes**
that the United States relies upon to achieve its security objectives.
B]{.underline}roader and deeper policy research and discussion is needed
on navigating the nexus of U.S. security and human rights objectives. In
the meantime, and to further that evolution, the United States should
adopt a set of guiding principles for conditions on security assistance
to improve the consistency and credibility of its foreign policy

### 2NC -- Say Yes

#### Positive conditionality is [effective]{.underline} -- especially for [intel-sharing]{.underline} and [defense cooperation]{.underline}

[The United States should develop a framework for **positive
conditionality** in security sector assistance to **better shape
political and security outcomes with partner countries**.]{.underline}
On balance an affirmative framework will offer the United States the
widest latitude in shaping outcomes in a broad range of circumstances.
This approach also does not rule out the sequencing of punitive steps
--- or a pause to assess partner performance.

First, this framework assumes an ex ante/positive approach to
conditionality, at least in some manner. With the U.S. government
providing security sector assistance to nearly 200 countries around the
world, it is unlikely that the United States will be initiating a
security sector assistance relationship wholly from scratch. [An ex ante
approach would **focus on developing concrete plans**, including
triggers for clearly identified conditions, at the inception of an
initiative or set of programs.]{.underline} It should involve a plan
covering at least five years, identifying ultimate objectives and
intermediate milestones, a theory of change for how objectives will be
achieved, and metrics to provide a basis for assessing progress.
Policymakers and planners can then link conditions to milestones and
metrics. Moreover, such an approach builds on recognized best practices
for capacity-building initiatives.

Second, the framework must include a partner government's mutual
participation in the creation of the assistance plan, the identification
of objectives, and the agreement on conditions. The partner will be more
incentivized to progress toward objectives when it understands and
commits to such objectives based on its own identified interests. A
memorandum of understanding, bilateral compact, or some other formal
written instrument can commit both parties to its terms.

Third, [the framework should **structure conditions as positive
inducements** for the recipient to take steps toward milestones or
objectives. Milestones could include completion of defense institutional
reforms]{.underline}, starting with development of a process to align
budget to strategy, progressing to completion of a first budget cycle
with the new process, and culminating in institutionalization of the
process through policy and/or law. They might also include progress
toward capability or interoperability milestones (e.g., ability to
conduct nighttime counter-terrorism operations in accordance with the
laws of armed conflict or command and control and intelligence
integration across platforms and systems). In addition, [milestones
could include transparency and accountability activities]{.underline}
(e.g., publication of public budget, completion of audit, investigation
of specific incidents of resource waste and abuse or diversion,
establishment and activity of an independent third-party investigative
unit for accountability).

[Partners will **likely respond to inducements** that are material in
nature, including access to an **expanded** variety of types of
**assistance** and an expanded quantity of assistance.]{.underline}
However, [partners may also value incentives such as eligibility for key
agreements to facilitate access and **information and/or technology
sharing**]{.underline} (e.g., acquisition and cross-servicing, general
security of military information, etc.) or eligibility for expanded
partnership opportunities (e.g., National Guard State Partnership
Program or the Military Personnel Exchange Program). Moreover,
incentives may also be political, such as access to membership in
certain organizations or eligibility for certain agreements.

### 2NC -- Net Ben -- I/L

#### Conditioning allies solves -- spurs [behavior change]{.underline} and causes [positive demonstration effects]{.underline}

homeland defense and America's security affairs in the Biden
Administration, senior fellow and deputy director of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, manager of the Nuclear Posture
Review, M.A. in international relations from the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, B.A. in
foreign affairs from the University of Virginia, "Smart Conditions: A
Strategic Framework for Leveraging Security Assistance",
https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/160706_Dalton_SmartConditions_Web.pdf//tyei

[The United States provides security assistance]{.underline} to
international partners [as a means to achieve its foreign policy and
supporting defense objectives. These objectives include]{.underline}
developing partner nations' military capabilities to enable them to
control territory, [**building interoperability** with U.S.
forces]{.underline}, and securing peacetime and contingency access to
critical air, land, and sea nodes. 1 [Security assistance also aims to
**deepen political and military relationships** that can advance the
U.S. foreign policy agenda]{.underline}. The outcomes and second order
effects of security assistance cannot be easily separated from policy or
politics, because they influence the partner country's monopoly on the
use of violence and thus its cohesion as a state.2

As a result, when the policies of countries receiving U.S. security
assistance fundamentally diverge from U.S. interests, the United States
faces a dilemma. [If it cuts off assistance to demonstrate American
displeasure, **it may risk losing leverage**]{.underline} in working
with the partner on other security objectives or broader foreign policy
priorities, although that leverage may be ill-defined or overstated. On
the other hand, [if the United States ignores the policy divergence, it
may **lose credibility with the partner**, as it then becomes difficult
to reasonably press for reform while continuing assistance flows. It may
also **diminish perceptions of U.S. moral leadership**, thereby also
putting wider U.S. **foreign policy objectives at risk** in that country
as well as internationally]{.underline}. Security services are often the
tool of authoritarian governments, and U.S. support for those security
services can enable them to continue repressive tactics and reinforce
perceptions that the United States is willing to choose a security
relationship over the well-being and rights of a country's citizens.

[Conditioning security assistance may **provide a middle ground** with
associated benefits, costs, and implementation challenges]{.underline}.
[Conditionality aims to leverage partners' reliance on U.S. aid to
incentivize them to take certain steps to **reform their behavior** and
better align their policies with U.S. interests and
objectives.]{.underline} [Conditioning assistance might also provide
**positive demonstration effects** to curb bad behavior among other
foreign partners]{.underline} [that are observing Washington's
response]{.underline} as an indication of how far U.S. tolerance may
stretch. Interestingly, some [empirical research shows that
unconditional military aid recipients are less likely than other states
to align policies with U.S. preferences]{.underline}.3
