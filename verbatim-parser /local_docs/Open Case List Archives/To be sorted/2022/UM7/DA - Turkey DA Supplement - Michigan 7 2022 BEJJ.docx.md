Wins?", https://fortune.com/2019/12/26/what-is-election-hacking/
\\\\SYang

1\. What is meant by ['**election hacking'**?]{.underline}

It's sometimes used as a catch-all phrase to encompass all sorts of
underhanded [efforts to **subvert elections**]{.underline}, including
the type of social media disinformation campaign undertaken by Russia to
taint elections in the U.S., Europe and Africa. But in its most literal
form, election hacking refers to [computer breaches that are intended to
**manipulate voter data**, **change a vote tally** or otherwise
**discredit tabulated results**.]{.underline}

[2. How could an **election be hacked**?]{.underline}

[A hacker could **reprogram** an **electronic voting
machine** directly]{.underline}, if it's left unguarded, or remotely, if
it's connected to the internet. (A popular topic at hacker
conferences is just how easy that would be to do.) Doing so undetected,
and on a scale large enough to influence an election result, wouldn't be
easy, as there are thousands of local jurisdictions with different
voting methods and equipment. But [hackers might only need to focus on a
**few key precincts** in a **swing state**. Or they could alter a
state's **voter-registration data** so that **large numbers** of voters
get **turned away** at the polls.]{.underline} The wireless process of
transmitting tabulated results to a local database is another possible
target. Ransomware could be used in the days leading up to or on
Election Day to hold the vote hostage. For anyone determined to do harm
to the democratic process, a successfully hacked election could sow
lasting mistrust in the voting process, whether or not it actually
changes who wins.

Hürriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi shared the [results of the
survey]{.underline} conducted with 2519 people between 12-15 May in his
column.

According to Selvi; \"[Which party would you vote for]{.underline} if
there was an election today?\" If the undecided ones are distributed,
the rate of those who answered the question is as follows:

[AKP 35.9, CHP 26.2, Good Party 10.7, MHP 10.4, HDP 10.1, DEVA 1.1,
Turkey Change Party 0.9, Country Party 0.5, Re-Wealth Party 0.9,
Felicity Party 0.8, BBP 0.8, Future Party 0.4, Victory Party 1.1, Vatan
Party 0.1]{.underline}

Hilmi Daşdemir, President of Optimar, commented, \"[Votees who voted for
the AK Party before do not go to other parties. Their heart is still
with the AK Party. If the AK Party makes a one-unit improvement, it will
provide a return of 10 units.\"]{.underline}

Presidential election

According to Selvi, in the presidential election[,]{.underline} 36.1% of
those who participated in Optimar\'s survey say that they will vote for
Erdoğan in the presidential election. Kılıçdaroğlu comes second with
11.9 percent. Mansur Yavaş comes in third place with 11.9 percent,
followed by Ekrem İmamoğlu with 8.4 percent. Selahattin Demirtaş is in
the fifth place with 4.7 percent, and Meral Akşener is in the sixth
place with 3.2 percent.

If there were an election this Sunday, would you vote for Erdogan for
the presidency?

\"If there were an election this Sunday, [would you vote for
Erdogan]{.underline} for the presidency?\" In the question, the [rate of
those who said \"I will vote for Erdogan\" was 43.8 percent. \"In the
past months, this rate has fluctuated between 38 percent and 41.5
percent. Erdogan has been on the rise again]{.underline} in recent
months,\" said Selvi.

opponents",
https://www.ft.com/content/2613206f-e33f-452b-803a-eed3edc8ce2d
\\\\SYang

[Turkey's **ruling alliance** has **unveiled a plan** to]{.underline}
amend the country's electoral laws that could [**damage the opposition's
efforts** to wrest **control of parliament**]{.underline} from the
ruling party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A long-awaited
**[package of changes]{.underline}** unveiled on Monday [included a
**surprise measure** that would **alter** the way that **members of
parliament** are **allocated** within **electoral
districts**]{.underline}.  The proposal, analysts say, could
[**undermine efforts** by a **group of opposition** parties to **take
control** of the **Turkish parliament**]{.underline} after almost two
decades of dominance by Erdogan's Justice and Development party (AKP).
**[Erdogan]{.underline}**, whose AKP came to power in 2002, [has
witnessed an **erosion of support** for his ruling party]{.underline} in
recent years as Turkey has suffered a succession of economic crises.
Although he spearheaded a 2018 change in the country's system of
governance that handed more power to the president, [he still needs
**control of parliament** to **approve legislation**]{.underline},
including the government's annual budget. Under the proposed changes,
members of parliament would be allocated based purely on the vote share
of each party in a given district. [The **current system**]{.underline},
by contrast, allocates MPs according to the vote share won by each
electoral alliance before dividing them up in line with the vote share
of each party within that bloc. That [allows parties to **pick up MPs**
in districts where they get a **small share** of the vote]{.underline}.
Can Selcuki, director of the Turkiye Raporu polling agency, said that if
the [**new rules** had been **applied to parliamentary
elections**]{.underline} that took place **[in 2018]{.underline}**, they
would have resulted in [**10 more MPs** for **Erdogan**'s ruling
alliance]{.underline} out of a total of 600. While that number is small,
Selcuki said, it could be critical for Erdogan if the next election is
very close. The change, if passed, also significantly reduces the
likelihood that Erdogan will bring forward presidential and
parliamentary elections that are scheduled for June 2023 because the
legislation would take 12 months to come into force once approved. The
draft legislation, which was put forward by the AKP and its partners
from the Nationalist Movement party (MHP), is likely to be adopted into
law given that the parties hold a majority in parliament. Opposition
parties, who for years struggled to dent the president's popularity,
struck their first serious blow in 2019 when they formed an official
electoral alliance to defeat the AKP in local elections in Istanbul,
Ankara and several other big cities. They have built on that
co-operation and grown increasingly bullish about their chances of
defeating Erdogan at the next national vote. The unexpected [plan to
**alter the voting system** is the latest sign of the **challenges**
faced by an **opposition** in confronting Erdogan, who has a **wide
array of tools** at his disposal as he seeks to **hang on to
power**.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- UQ -- AT: Opposition Winning

#### [DISUNITY]{.underline} -- no single [opposition candidate]{.underline} means [no shot]{.underline} Erdogan [loses]{.underline}.

\\\\SYang

[**Cracks appeared** in a **Turkish opposition alliance** hoping to take
on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in polls next year after members of
the bloc had a **public spat** over who should be **their
candidate**. ]{.underline}

[**Kemal Kilicdaroglu**, a member of Turkey's **Alevi religious
minority** and head of the secular **CHP party** is seen as a
**potential opposition nominee**. But **one of his allies questioned**
whether he can muster the support of **majority Sunni Muslim voters**
crucial to ending the decades-long rule of Erdogan's AK
Party.]{.underline}

[With elections scheduled for **June 2023,** Erdogan still has **no
clear rival.** ]{.underline}

"His being an Alevi is not an obstacle for me, because I know him, I
know his principles. But the goal in politics is to win," said Ibrahim
Halil Oral, a lawmaker from the IYI party, referring to Kilicdaroglu.

"If 65% or 70% of Turkey has a conservative profile, a different name
would be chosen that can appeal to them," Oral said in an interview
broadcast on social media. 

Engin Altay, a senior member of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, dismissed Oral's
concerns. 

IYI leader Meral Aksener publicly apologized to Kilicdaroglu and leader
of the opposition Saadet Party, Temel Karamollaoglu, expressed sadness
over the remarks.

"Seeking race or sect rather than merit in the nomination criteria is
the greatest evil that can be done to our country, our people and our
future," Karamollaoglu said in a written statement.

Alevis, members of an offshoot of Shiite Islam, are estimated to make up
around one-fifth of Turkey's population. They have complained of
discrimination under Erdogan and his AK Party, which has roots in Sunni
Islamist movements. The government has denied discrimination. 

Kilicdaroglu's party is buoyed by a 2019 local election victory that
ended the AK Party's quarter-century rule over Turkey's largest city,
Istanbul, and its capital of Ankara. The party has formed an alliance
with five other parties in the hopes of defeating Erdogan in the
parliamentary and presidential elections. 

Another potential presidential hopeful for the opposition, Istanbul
mayor [**Ekrem Imamoglu**, is facing a **prison term** of as many as
**four years**]{.underline} on charges of insulting election board
officials. 

### 2NC -- UQ -- AT: F-16s

#### F-16 sale isn't going through -- the house is blocking.

Connor **O'Brien 7/14**, defense reporter for POLITICO, July 14, 2022,
"House adds roadblock to Biden\'s plan to sell U.S. fighter jets to
Turkey",
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/14/house-adds-roadblock-to-bidens-quest-to-sell-u-s-fighter-jets-to-turkey-00045825
\\\\SYang

[The **House** on Thursday threw up a **roadblock** to President **Joe
Biden's** push to sell new F**-16 fighters to Turkey** in yet another
**blow to the administration's efforts** from fellow
Democrats.]{.underline}

[**Lawmakers tacked on a provision** to annual defense policy
legislation that **bars the U.S.** from **selling** or **transferring**
the **jets** unless the **administration certifies** that doing so is
**critical to U.S.** **nat**ional **sec**urity.]{.underline}

The vote was 244-179 on an amendment offered by New Hampshire
Democrat Chris Pappas to the National Defense Authorization Act. The
majority of Democrats, 184, backed the effort, along with 60
Republicans.

It's the [**latest dent in a potential sale** of the Lockheed
Martin-built jets to Ankara. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob
**Menendez** (D-N.J.), one of the **four top lawmakers who must sign
off** on weapons sales to foreign nations, is **refusing to back the
transfer**.]{.underline}

[The **dual hurdles** make it nearly **impossible** for Biden to
**follow through** on selling the **fighters** to the NATO
ally]{.underline} as lawmakers express exasperation over Ankara's
purchase of advanced Russian equipment, violating the territory of its
neighbors and its drift toward autocracy under President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan.

#### Erdogan won't say yes to the conditions -- the link proves.

Dora **Antoniou 7/16**, journalist for Kathimerini, a daily, political
and financial morning newspaper published in Athens, "Ankara not likely
to accept F-16 strings",
https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1189154/ankara-not-likely-to-accept-f-16-strings/
\\\\SYang

[The approval this week of a **relevant amendment** by the **US
Congress** which is seen as a **first step** to **stop the sale** of
**new F-16** aircraft to **Turkey**]{.underline} and the upgrading of
its existing ones has caused optimism in Greece that its positions are
being heeded. But there are also several opposing forces at play, which
are making the situation complicated. 

According to Dr Triantafyllos Karatrantos, an analyst at the Hellenic
Foundation for European & Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP) think tank, a clearly
positive development would be that [**any agreement** to **sell or
upgrade aircraft to Turkey** is accompanied by a **strict framework**
stipulating **good neighborly relations** and **avoiding provocations**,
**disputes** or **engagement** with third countries.]{.underline}

However, he expressed reservations as to whether Ankara would agree to
such a restrictive framework at the current juncture. 

[**Turkish President** Recep Tayyip **Erdogan**, he said, is in
**pre-election mode** and with the **issue of nationalism** high on the
agenda **would not accept** such an **agreement**. ]{.underline}

#### The House has [blocked]{.underline} the sale of [F-16's]{.underline} to Turkey.

Accessed 7-22-2022; AW\]

The US [House of Representatives]{.underline} voted to [approve a
measure that will likely **block the sale of F-16 fighter jets** to
Turkey]{.underline} on Thursday. The measure [prohibits the US President
from selling or transferring the fighter jets or kits to Turkey unless
the President can show Congress that Turkey has "not **violated the
sovereignty** of Greece" in the last 120 days.]{.underline} It also
[requires the President to stipulate that]{.underline} [providing the
materials to Turkey]{.underline} is [in the **national interest** of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, a **[high but not impossible
bar]{.underline}** to clear. The amendment was added to the National
Defense Authorization Act, the country's massive military spending bill
for 2023, and was approved by a House of Representatives committee this
week. After its approval, it had to be passed by Congress. The
amendment, which was pushed by Greek-American Democrat Chris Pappas from
New Hampshire and Frank Pallone, Democrat from New Jersey, was passed by
Congress in a 244 to 179 vote on Thursday. Although passed by Congress,
the entire bill, including the amendment, must be voted on by the Senate
before becoming law. The massive bill, which allots a stunning \$800
billion in defense spending, will likely go through a round of changes
before it is passed by the Senate in the coming months. The amendment
also [mandates that the US President show concrete steps have been
"taken to ensure that such F-16s are not used by Turkey for **repeated
unauthorized territorial overflights**]{.underline} of Greece." US
Congress passes amendment to block sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey
The amendment comes at a particularly tense moment in Greece-Turkey
relations. [In recent months, the Turkish military has conducted
overflights of its aircraft above Greek islands without
approval]{.underline}, prompting rebuke from Greece and other nations.
In June, a spokesperson for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said "the
violation of Greek air space and overflights above Greek islands is not
correct." [Turkey's refusal to talk to allies within NATO]{.underline}
was "[**counterproductive and contrary** to the **spirit of the
alliance**]{.underline}," the spokesperson added.

He made the remarks after a meeting with [Sen. Bob

over arms sales]{.underline} to other nations as [chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee]{.underline}. Menendez's home state of New

adversarial NATO ally [Turkey]{.underline} [particularly unpopular among
many of his constituents.]{.underline} Greece, Turkey jockey for
position in Washington [Menendez]{.underline} has threatened to [use his
leverage to block the \$6 billion sale of 40 Lockheed Martin Block 70
F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.]{.underline} Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
Mitsotakis directly appealed to Congress to block the F-16 sale during
an address before a joint meeting of Congress in May -- immediately
after he announced Greece's intention to acquire the F-35 at the White
House. The [U.S. kicked Turkey out of the F-35 co-production program in
2019]{.underline} over Ankara's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile
defense amid fears its advanced radar system could allow Moscow to spy
on the stealth fighter jets. The [Greeks have found **a critical ally**
in Menendez as they seek to block the F-16 sale to Turkey amid repeated
Turkish violations of Greek airspace]{.underline}, the ongoing
occupation of Northern Cyprus and maritime disputes over gas exploration
in the eastern Mediterranean. This puts Athens at odds with President
Joe Biden, who voiced support for the F-16 sale at the NATO summit in
Madrid last month after Turkey dropped its opposition to Swedish and
Finnish accession to the alliance. The Turks are also seeking a separate
\$400 million sale to upgrade their current F-16 jets with new missiles,
radar and electronics. "We should sell them the F-16 jets and modernize
those jets as well," [Biden]{.underline} said in Madrid. "But I [need
congressional approval to be able to do that]{.underline}, and I think
we can get that." It remains [unclear how the White House plans to
persuade Menendez]{.underline}, who remains committed to [using his
position to **block the sale.** Menendez told Defense News on Monday
that he remains a **hard no** on the F-16s]{.underline} but said he
could consider the sale [if Turkey addresses issues he has previously
raised with Ankara]{.underline}. Those include its actions in the
eastern Mediterranean, its continued possession of the S-400s, it human
rights record and ongoing attacks against the US-backed fighters in
northeast Syria.

### 2NC -- UQ -- AT: Economy

#### The Turkish economy [structurally beats inflation]{.underline}---[adaptation]{.underline}, [diversity]{.underline}, and [demand]{.underline} signal [durable growth]{.underline}.

Accessed 7-25-2022; AW\]

Amid such chaos, it is remarkable that [the economy has kept
going]{.underline} as [well as it has]{.underline}. Much of that is [the
result of Turkey's **many commercial strengths**]{.underline}. It has a
[large domestic market of 85m mostly young consumers]{.underline}, and
has long been a staging post for trade between east and west. The
country's business culture has deep roots. The proportion of the
population that aspires to be entrepreneurs is high by international
standards. There are, broadly speaking, [three kinds of Turkish
business]{.underline}. The first is large firms, often conglomerates.
These account for a quarter of employment and half of the business
sector's value-added. Some are joint ventures with European firms. The
best manufacture high-quality capital goods, car parts and military
hardware for export. They approach German levels of productivity. At the
other end of the scale are small, unregistered firms, with low
productivity. In between is a third group of medium-sized family firms,
with some workers on the books and others not. This [structure helps
explain the agility of Turkish business. Many large firms are
conservatively run and **diversified across industries** and export
markets, which gives them a **built-in resilience**.]{.underline} The
largest conglomerate, Koc Holding, has four main divisions: vehicles and
parts (in joint ventures with Ford and Fiat), white goods, oil refining
and banking. Sabanci Holding, another conglomerate, has retail, energy,
cement-making, banking and manufacturing businesses. The best [mid-sized
family firms share with them a nimbleness that comes from **years of
living with economic volatility**. Turkey has a history of high
inflation. Bosses have become experts at juggling finances]{.underline}.
[Companies have had time to adjust to a weak lira]{.underline} since
2018. Many have reduced their dollar debts. [Smaller firms **adjust by
other means**.]{.underline} The line between company and household is
blurred. Risks are pooled among family members. Very often [the response
to adversity is to work harder]{.underline}. Four-fifths of the
workforce put in more than 40 hours a week in their main job, one of the
highest shares in the oecd---though long hours compensate for low labour
productivity. [Another strategy for small and mid-sized firms is to push
business into the grey economy, where wages often do not keep up with
inflation or minimum-wage laws.]{.underline} Istanbulls H[ard work and
agility help businesses to keep going. But they also need
demand.]{.underline} One of the [big surprises in Turkey has been the
strength of **consumer spending**.]{.underline} Inflation in the high
single-digits has weighed on consumers in Europe and America. Yet, [in
Turkey, far higher inflation has not **sapped demand**. There are plenty
of theories as to why. One is that consumers saw the fall of the lira,
knew what that meant for future inflation, and **splurged in
anticipation** of higher prices.]{.underline} Durable goods in
particular are a hedge against inflation. New cars, white goods or
imported luxuries hold their worth better than lira, even if they are
not as liquid a store of value as, say, gold coins or dollar bills. With
interest rates so low in real terms it is almost negligent not to borrow
to spend.

born after 2000 --- [**would not vote for Erdogan** in Turkey\'s **2023
general election.**]{.underline}

Why It Matters: [Erdogan is resorting to **populism** to try to attract
**Gen Z voters**, who will account for around 11.8% of the voting
population in 2023]{.underline}, and [the president likely will try more
**special subsidies** that may adversely affect the government\'s
finances to try to win them over. Without **Gen Z**\'s support,
**Erdogan could lose the election** next year.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Link -- Gen-Z

#### [Gen-Z voters]{.underline} want [reliable politics]{.underline}, hate [hypocrisy]{.underline}, and are [nationalist]{.underline} -- the plan's [bolt from the blue]{.underline} is a [disaster]{.underline} for [Erdogan]{.underline}.

With a young population that has seen constant growth, [**Turkey** is
getting ready to welcome **millions of new voters** from **Gen**eration
**Z** in the 20**23 presidential** and parliamentary
**elections**]{.underline}. Although there are still two years until the
polls, which sounds like a long time, the political parties have already
rolled up their sleeves to attract the youth, who have unique
characteristics compared to the previous generations due to being raised
in a digital era. Being aware of their worth, [the **members** of
**Gen**eration **Z expect more understanding**]{.underline} from the
elderly, **[demanding]{.underline}** a stable economy and [**reliable
politics**,]{.underline} pointing to these [as their **criteria to vote
for any political party**.]{.underline}

\"[My **primary criterion** in voting for a political view is to **stand
strong against the outside world**, to **defend our rights** and **not
to compromise**]{.underline},\" said 17-years-old Kaan. \"[The second is
that **the candidate** or th**e political par**ty should not be
**hypocritical**. He/she should **not speak differently to everyone** in
order to to **make everyone happy**. Of course, they should also **keep
their promises**]{.underline}.\"

### 2NC -- I/L -- Gen-Z

#### [Gen-Z voters]{.underline} are [key to the election]{.underline} -- huge [voter population]{.underline} and they're [swing voters]{.underline} who [vote temporally]{.underline}.

Çiğdem **Yılmaz 7/19**, journalist for the Hurriyet Daily news, the
oldest English-language daily in Turkey, July 19, 2022, "Generation Z to

ballots in 2023 polls",

[**Millions of Turkish youth** will vote for the **first time** in their
lives in the **general elections in 2023**, as]{.underline} parties are
expected to put those who are seen as [holding a **key to the country's
future**]{.underline} at the heart of their campaigns, according to a
research conducted by daily Milliyet.

"[**Gen**eration **Z** is a very **political generation**]{.underline}
contrary to popular belief that they are apolitical. The only difference
is that [their **political views are not stable**; they
determine politics **temporally**]{.underline}," said Murat Şeker, the
head of the City Politics Center at Istanbul University.

Gen Z, the world's first digital natives who have never known a world
without internet in their pocket, make up 39 percent of Turkey's
population, according to data compiled by Milliyet. Twenty percent of
them, therefore a little over 5 million of members of Gen Z, will vote
for the first time in their lives in Turkey's general elections in 2023.
One million of them will be new voters in Istanbul, the country's
largest city by population, in 2023.

"Since their birth, the country has been governed by the same political
party," said Şeker.

They do not know a Turkey without the ruling Justice and Development
Party (AKP). That's why, according to Şeker, it is important to
understand that [they **do not care** about the **past Turkey** and
comparisons made to indicate the old Turkey is nothing to long
for.]{.underline}

Turkish people are familiar with the concept of "the Father State," a
term meaning that the state is like a father who cares for his citizens.
But [**Gen Z does not** see the state as **their father**, he
added.]{.underline}

"The state is no longer a father to them. [They see it as an
**organization that must serve them**]{.underline}," added Şeker,
stressing that they are well aware of global trends and are able to
evaluate things in line with the patterns in the rest of the world. They
see the mistakes of all political movements and can easily change their
minds.

### 1NC -- ! -- Syrian Invasion

#### [Erdogan]{.underline} will [invade Syria]{.underline} if he thinks [he's losing]{.underline} to [save face]{.underline} with his [nationalist base]{.underline} because [Ukraine opened]{.underline} an [opportunity]{.underline} -- that causes [Russia draw-in]{.underline} and [terrorism]{.underline} -- [turns case]{.underline}.

\\\\SYang

Erdoğan's one-man foreign policy strategy

[**Turkish President** Recep Tayyip **Erdoğan** is notorious for
pursuing a **one-man fo**reign **po**licy **strat**egy to
**consolidate** his **popularity** with his **nationalist voter
base**]{.underline}. Five years ago, Erdoğan resolved to transform
Turkey's parliamentary system into a highly centralized presidential
system without any meaningful checks and balances. To sell his plan to
Turkish voters, Erdoğan insisted that an executive presidency would
solve Turkey's economic woes, enhance its stability, and facilitate more
effective decision making. He subsequently won a 2017 referendum on the
issue that granted sweeping power over the country to the presidency,
despite widespread allegations of irregularities in the vote. Erdoğan
secured this power for himself after winning the presidential elections
a year later. Since then, he has enjoyed full control over Turkey's
defense and foreign affairs. [Erdoğan has utilized **bold**, and
sometimes **reckless**, **fo**reign **po**licy as a **vehicle** for his
**political ambitions**. He has launched **military interventions** in
**Libya** and **Syria**, pressed **territorial claims** in the
**Mediterranean**, and even **courted Russia** for a **military
partnership**, all to rally **nationalist sentiment** behind his
leadership. Now, **Russia's invasion of Ukraine** has **opened up** new
high-risk **opportunities** for **Erdoğan** to **improve** his
**domestic image**, especially as the next **Turkish presidential** and
parliamentary **elections approach.**]{.underline}

A Turkish invasion of northern Syria

[Turkey considers the **armed Kurdish presence** at its **border with
Syria** an **absolute** and **existential threat.** Ankara fears that
**a**n organized and **militarized Kurdish force** striving for
**autonomy in Syria** could **rally Turkey's** substantial **Kurdish
population** and **compromise Turkey's sovereignty**. Given this acute
danger, a **Turkish invasion** of northern Syria appears **inevitable**
--- it simply boils down to a question of when. **Erdoğan**, with his
**opportunistic mindset** and **concerns for his political position**,
has calculated that the **moment could be near**.]{.underline}

[On **Oct. 6, 2019**, President **Donald Trump** ordered **American
troops** to **abruptly withdraw** from **northeast Syria**]{.underline}
in an effort to reduce U.S. military commitments abroad --- a move that
was not actually fully implemented. Three days later, [Turkey
capitalized on the partial **security void** and established a 30-km
"**safe zone"** along its border with Syria.]{.underline} Erdoğan's
goals were to push back Kurdish fighters that he regards as terrorists
and to relocate the Syrian refugees that had flooded into Turkey
throughout the Syrian civil war. Today, [Erdoğan hopes that Russia's
preoccupation with **Ukraine** will create a similar **power vacuum in
northeast Syria** that he can once again **exploit**. Russia's invasion
of Ukraine has **consumed Moscow's attention** and **depleted its
resources**, creating the impression that Syria has become **less of a
priority**]{.underline}. This perception of a shrinking Russian presence
in Syria has provided an excuse for Turkey to launch yet another
military incursion into its southern neighbor. Erdoğan
has renewed threats of a military campaign to "clean up" Syrian border
cities and rid them of terrorists, and Turkish forces have already
begun shelling countryside villages there. [There is a **very real
possibility** that Turkey may launch another **invasion
soon.**]{.underline}

[Bolstering Erdoğan's **domestic political position**]{.underline}

[With Turkey's **June 2023 presidential** and parliamentary **elections
looming**, Erdoğan needs to **consolidate his voting base** now more
than ever.]{.underline} Six opposition parties in Turkey have declared
their commitment to unseat Erdoğan and restore parliamentary democracy
by rolling back his executive presidential system. These developments
have taken place as various public opinion polls show the president's
approval rating has declined and as Turkey faces a worsening economic
crisis. Erdoğan's re-election prospects are growing dimmer.

[A **Turkish offensive in Syria** could provide the **win** that Erdoğan
needs to **save** his **domestic political position. T**]{.underline}he
Kurdistan Workers Party' (PKK) is a Kurdish militant group that operates
in both Turkey and Syria and has engaged in an armed struggle for
Kurdish autonomy against the Turkish state since 1984. [A new **Turkish
military campaign** against **PKK** bases across the Syrian border could
**bolster Erdoğan's reputation** as a **victor** in the **fight against
terrorism**.]{.underline}

[Additionally, the **Turkish population** appears to be **losing
patience** with the 3.6 ]{.underline}million[ **Syrian refugees**
resident **in the country**.]{.underline} In August last year, mobs of
Turkish nationals ransacked Syrian-owned businesses and homes after a
Turkish teenager was stabbed to death in a fight with a group of
refugees. Furthermore, a 2021 poll suggested over 70% of Turks would
support any party promising the toughest action on refugees.
[Establishing **new safe zones** in **northern Syria** would enable
Erdoğan to send many of these **refugees to Syria**, thus **improving
his standing** with **voters**.]{.underline}

[Finally, **intervening in Syria** would enable Erdoğan to **shift
Turkey's national conversation** away from its **economic troubles** and
towards **identity politics**.]{.underline} A Turkish invasion of Syria
directly targets two of Turkey's most notable ethnic minorities: the
Kurds and the Syrians. [By **othering these groups**, Erdoğan can pump a
**populist nationalist discourse** mobilizing **public opinion in his
favor**.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[Erdoğan views the **international stage** through a **lens of
opportunities**. The emerging **power vacuum in Syria** is the **next
opportunity** for him to pursue Turkey's **national security agenda**
and **quash the PKK** while **strengthening his political position** at
home. A Turkish invasion would **feed the increasingly nationalist
fervor** in Turkey that has kept Erdoğan in power for so long. **Foreign
policy is his instrument** of choice to **shore up his domestic
standing** and **maintain his hold on power**]{.underline}, and now that
his position is under threat with the upcoming elections, Erdoğan will
be sounding his trumpet as loud as he can. For Bashar al-Assad's Syria,
this means a hostile foreign power infringing on its already chaotic
borders. [For **Russia**, this means a **revitalized threat against a
critical regional ally.** For the **U**nited **S**tates, this could mean
an **emboldened ISIS presence** in the **Middle East**, since **Kurdish
forces** in northern Syria regularlnoy collaborate with the U.S.
military to **contain ISIS.**]{.underline} Finally, for Erdoğan, this is
a chance for yet another boost forward in his quest for absolute
authority over his country.

#### It\'s likely now -- Erdogan's telling the U.S. to withdraw.

former correspondent for Turkish media outlets Daily Sabah and ATV,
"Turkish president tells US to remove forces from northern Syria",
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-wants-us-out-northern-syria
\\\\SYang

[Turkish President Recep Tayyip **Erdogan** has called on the **U**nited
**S**tates to **leave northern Syria**]{.underline}, saying the
withdrawal could weaken \"terror groups\" supported by Washington.

[\"The **US needs to leave** the **areas** on the **east of the river
Euphrates**, this is our conclusion at the **Astana \[talks\],\"**
**Erdogan** told a group of **journalists**]{.underline} who accompanied
him to Tehran on Tuesday for a trilateral summit with
his Iranian and Russian counterparts.

[\"It is the **US** that **feeds** the **terror groups** there; it would
ease our work if the **US withdraws** or cuts **support** to these
groups.\"]{.underline}

[In **recent weeks**, the **Turkish military** has been **sending
reinforcements** to **northern Syria,** especially areas near the town
of Tal Rifaat, which is held by the **People's Protection Units**
(YPG),]{.underline} a US-backed Kurdish militia that Turkey considers
the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK), and a terror
group. 

#### That causes [terrorism]{.underline} and [instability]{.underline} -- [conflict multiplier]{.underline}.

\\\\SYang

A3: [A **Turkish invasion** of **northeastern Syria** is likely to
result in a **high number of casualties** in the near term and
**significant instability** in the longer term.]{.underline} For years,
the SDF was the principal U.S. partner in the campaign against the ISG,
and it has grown into a formidable fighting force.

[Perhaps the **greatest fear** is the **resurgence of the ISG** in
**Syria**]{.underline}. With the SDF focused on the north to repel a
Turkish attack, it will redeploy forces from southeastern Syria. These
areas have already witnessed sporadic attacks from ISG cells and a spike
in tensions between the local Arab tribes and the SDF in recent months.
[The **attack** may also mean the **release** of up some **12,000 jihadi
prisoners** and **tens of thousands** of **dependents** who are in areas
controlled by the SDF]{.underline}. The ISG has called on its members to
free the detainees. The White House claims that Turkey will assume
responsibility for these detainees, but [the chances of a **smooth
handover** from Kurdish to Turkish authorities is **slim**.]{.underline}

In addition, [the **humanitarian impact** of a **Turkish attack** likely
would be **dire**.]{.underline} The United Nations says that [more than
**758,000 people** live in the **border zone**, many of whom have
already been displaced at least once during the conflict]{.underline}.
These civilians [would likely **flee south** from the **border
area**]{.underline} into Arab-majority areas and across the border [to
**Iraq**, which is experiencing **widespread** and **violent protests**.
Turkey's plans to **resettle**]{.underline} as many as a million
[**Syrian refugees** to the **border area** would **dramatically
change** the **ethnic makeup** of the region, **fueli**ng further
**instability**.]{.underline}
