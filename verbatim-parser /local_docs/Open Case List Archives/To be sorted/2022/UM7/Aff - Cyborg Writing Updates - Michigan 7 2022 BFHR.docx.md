**[2AC \-- Queer Time Travel]{.underline}**

**Thus we affirm queer time travel -- an understanding of queer
histories of violence, trauma, kinship, and hope as always already
materializing in the present. The 1AC is a queer time machine through
which we become unstuck in time, existing at the confluence of past,
present, and future that lies beyond the productive regimes of
chrononormativity. Our hauntological echo of the calls of the dead
embraces queer collectivity across time and generates possibilities of
life in moments outside the sequence.**

When I talk about **[[time travel as a weapon of queer culture and
against chrononormativity,]{.mark}]{.underline}** I am speaking
conceptually not of a linear time machine that can travel up and down a
time stream a la Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future (1985) where the
past, present, and future become wholly separated countries that can be
visited, left, and returned to, but of a time travel that **[[is an
unmooring]{.mark}. Part of a rebellion against chrononormativity is,
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** borrow a term from Kurt Vonnegut Jr's 1969
novel Slaughterhouse-Five, to **[[become "unstuck in
time."]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Vonnegut 24). A good breakdown of the
static and cyclical nature of womanhood under chrononormativism appears
in author Ted Chiang's novella Story of Your Life (2000). In Chiang's
work, it takes an encounter with an inhuman subjectivity, through the
extra-terrestrial language of the Heptapods that the narrator Louise's
perception of self becomes unstuck. Through her experience of past and
future as present Louise's experience of time becomes a "simultaneous
mode of awareness" (Chiang 31), making her experience the
chrononormative stages of womanhood both out of order and all at once.
Through this experience, her sense of self is redrawn from static,
sequential and separate identities of different productive moments into
an identity of many simultaneous selves, structured around the life and
death of her daughter, forcing her to reconsider the artificial barriers
between the different stages of her life: childless, a new mother, and a
mother who has lost their child. Louise must experience the loss of her
daughter before her birth, going against the schedule of
chronobiopolitics. Freeman notes that "mourning, romance, empathy, and
affection" (Freeman 6) are all imperfect acts of resisting the imposed
system, as these feelings cannot be "segmented into clock time" (6) even
if public artifices such as funerals or weddings and other events meant
to symbolize such feelings do. I would argue that Chiang's story is an
exercise in becoming aware of chronogeopolitics but does not radically
reject it, Louise ultimately choosing to still embrace acting out the
timeline set for her, even though she is aware of its artifice.
Nevertheless, **[[when the project of unmooring oneself from
chronogeopolitics ties itself to a queer culture]{.mark} as opposed to
the dominant straight one which chrononormativity promotes, then
[becoming unstuck in time can be]{.mark}come [a]{.mark} far more
[radical act. Queer time machines are built out of community, and out of
the legacy that communities leave for each other across time, regardless
of the limitations that timelines of the state would]{.mark} attempt to
[impose]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Queer time travel is an act not of
productivity and forward momentum, but of connection with a past and
future that are still]{.mark}, in many ways,
[present.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Here I return to K.I.P, Freeman's
primary example of queer art as a rejection of our chronogeopolitical
landscape. Freeman describes K.I.P. as a "Queer hauntology exercise"
(13). Hauntology was a term coined in Jacques Derrida's work Specters of
Marx, an extrapolation of the idea that Karl Marx's theories argue for
"an ethics of responsibility towards the other across time" (9).
**[[Hauntology exists in a space where history continues to interact
with the present]{.mark}, the figure of the ghost or t[he dead
are]{.mark} not removed from us, but still [present in our social and
cultural consciousness,]{.mark} even though we cannot reach through time
to act on this responsibility. [The dead call for a "different
future"]{.mark} (9) than the one we can deliver to them, [for
possibilities now lost]{.mark}]{.underline}**. K.I.P. exposes a
**[[queerness]{.mark}]{.underline}** to viewers that **["[jam\[s\]
historical sequence"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (13). We see the artist
Nguyen pasting their own image onto a historical moment that they "never
experienced but nevertheless clearly mourns for" (13). In this film, we
are watching many historical moments blend and interact in a "community
of past and present viewers" (13). There is the actual pornography, its
male performers unknowingly documenting the freeness of queer identity
as it existed before the devastation of the AIDS epidemic. Then are the
original viewers of the erotica, both pre- and post- aids, then there is
Nguyen, reaching across decades to touch a moment of queer identity in
the 1970s with a queer identity of the 21st century. There is Freeman,
present by analysis, and there is us, the spectators watching from the
ever-retreating goalpost of modernity. In Slaughterhouse-Five, time for
Vonnegut's protagonist Billy Pilgrim is once again experienced out of
sequence in a chaotic restructuring of subjectivity, where Billy can go
"to sleep a senile widower and awaken on his wedding day" (23), forcing
another disintegration of the walls between the productive identities of
chronogeopolitics. Billy must reconcile identities like widower and
bachelor, soldier and veteran, child and elder, not as separate
sequential identities, but as a single simultaneous form. Here, like in
K.I.P., time is structured not by signification but trauma. Time for
Billy splintered into a similar before and after of trauma centred on
the Allied bombing of the German city of Dresden, an event experienced
by Billy and Vonnegut himself as prisoners of war. Vonnegut creates
another performance of hauntology, forcing Billy Pilgrim to watch a
documentary on the firebombing "backwards then forwards" (75) so that he
can see bomber planes suck "bullets and shell fragments" (75) back into
their machine guns and the fires back into their bombs, until "the
American fliers turned in their uniforms and became high school kids.
And Hitler turned into a baby" (75), and then is forced to watch history
and its trauma and violence play out again. It is also worth noting
that, like in Arrival, the subjectivity of Vonnegut's human character is
changed, in part, by interaction with aliens. **[[Hauntology takes a
"collective past"]{.mark} (Freeman 14) [and brings it into]{.mark} both
[the]{.mark} collective and personal [present. When we experience
hauntology, we are]{.mark} not trying to "write a lost object into the
present" (14) but [experiencing the past as something still directly
happening and affecting us]{.mark}. Through hauntology, we experience
["the present itself as a hybrid" (14) of collective pasts and
future]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. While in Vonnegut's case, the hauntology
creates a hybrid from the experiences of war**[, [queer hauntology
is]{.mark} a broader experiment, [a haunting of the past that is
intergenerational and ever-evolving]{.mark}. This experiment in queer
hauntology presents what Freeman describes as [a "queer
becoming-collective across-time"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (11). In K.I.P.,
we can separate past from present only by noting how the different
**[[moments of queerness are "split by prior violence and future
possibility"]{.mark} (9) and [not merely the chrononormative
classifications of time separated by the signification of sequences and
cycles]{.mark} that the chrononormative cycle demands.]{.underline}**
We, through Nguyen and Freeman, are subjected to **[a description of
[queer culture that belongs simultaneously to many different moments of
queer history]{.mark}, and all of them, pre and post aids
crisis.]{.underline}** For the queer observer, K.I.P's haunting might
not present itself as only a historical note, but as **[an ever-present
encounter, the power of the erotic and the power of longing not at all
being a separate country but a present happening.]{.underline}** In
drawing her literary examples of queer hauntology and chrononormativity,
Freeman turns to Shakespeare, and particularly to Hamlet -- a story that
resists chrononormativity and invites hauntings through both the
structure of the play and its content in equal measure. Hamlet is a play
of overlapping bodies. There are the bodies of the dead, the living, the
legislative body of the court of Denmark, the body of the prince
himself, the body of players within the play, the non-corporeal body of
the dead returned, and the play itself existing as its kind of
stationary body. In Hamlet, like perhaps in K.I.P, the body becomes a
metaphor for "the means for and effect of convoluting time" (Freeman
14), and in turn the narrative timelines that are present in the two
primary forms of most of Shakespeare's own other narratives -- namely
the marriage plot of the comedy, and the revenge plot of the tragedy.
Hamlet both stops and confuses these narratives, the wedding being the
beginning of the play instead of the end, the prince unable to ever
truly enact his revenge. When Freeman suggests that Hamlet is a story
yearning for a "lost Eden \[from an\] era prior to the establishment of
the catholic church" (Freeman 16), this presents itself both through
Hamlet's seeming homoeroticism, and also the very fact that the timeline
of the church constrains the play. Unlike many other Shakespearean
revenges, Hamlet is frozen by the timeline of a Christian universe,
literally unable to kill his uncle while in prayer without also giving
his uncle the implicit victory that a Christian timeline demands "A
villain kills my father, and for that I, his sole son, do send this same
villain to heaven" (Hamlet III.3 76-77). Hamlet stands in stark contrast
to, for example, Titus Andronicus, where the timeline of the state
declares death to be an absolute end. In Freeman's queer reading of
Hamlet, this frozen nature of the narrative and its prince also spill
out in his inability to pursue Laertes instead of Ophelia, trapped in a
world and a time where "love between men is, indeed, out of joint"
(Freeman 16), present but unreachable. If anything the "fantasia of
corporeal disfigurement and fragmentation" (15) of Hamlet is only
heightened in Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead
(1967), itself a 20th century hauntology experiment within the Hamlet
Narrative, cyclically taking place before, during, and after the events
of the original play, always experiencing the present as that
aforementioned hybrid. Here Stoppard's two protagonists only amplify
those themes of homo-erotic desire, becoming both inseparable and
intermingled in their identities, as well as carrying the fragmentation
of timeline to its extreme, living a life-after-death that refuses to
fade, experiencing "death, and then eternity (Stoppard 2.228). I
reference Stoppard not to pull away from Freeman's analysis of
Shakespeare, but to illustrate how ripe Shakespeare's body of work is
for such queer readings and instances of hauntology, and how older works
can become queered and unstuck from a time when a modern setting applies
pressure. Stoppard's play is a hybrid of his work and Shakespeare, of
timelines and the sensibilities of modernity and antiquity. As Freeman
applies her queer reading to the appearance of The Ghost in Hamlet, I
could also argue for a queering of the haunting that occurs near the end
of Richard the Third, where the ghosts of the tyrants victims return as
the "thousand several tongues, And every tongue brings in a several
tale, and every tale condemns me for a villain." (Richard III
V.3.194-195), each body of the dead returning to press themselves onto
Richard in the present, to declare "despair and die" (V.3.125) to their
murderer. Though Richard III is actually guilty of his crimes, I think a
queer reading can link this experience of haunting to the sense of guilt
and grief mapped onto queer hauntology's such as K.I.P. as a result of
the split between pre and post aids crisis. It is hard not to read the
title K.I.P. as Freeman does, with K.I.P. laced with the suggestion of
"rest in peace,' indicating both the desire to enliven the dead and the
understanding that this is never wholly possible." (Freeman 13) Freeman
spills out from Hamlet into Midsummer Night's Dream as a better erotic
companion for K.I.P. than the bard's other works, mapping how the sexual
timelines of both the mortal and fairy world "move in tandem with one
another" (Freeman 17), and with the character of Puck (who is notably
undefined by normative gender throughout the history of the character
and their performances) acting as the agent of unmooring for the
normative sexual timeline of the other characters, both altering the
Fairy Queens plans for love, and overriding the sexual agency and
timelines of the four human characters that wander into the fairy
domain. Freeman also touches on the queerness of the Rude Mechanicals of
Midsummer Night's Dream. Like in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,
and Hamlet, the players within the play exist as a performance of
hauntology. The present is a hybrid, players performing histories as
tangible and still happening through the device of the story within the
story-- with the narrative of Hamlet echoed and repeated by both the
players in Hamlet and Stoppard's addition, and the Mechanicals
imprinting and queering the story of Romeo and Juliet through the farce
of Pyramus and Thisbe (where the two heteronormative lovers are both
played by male actors) The players in all these cases, which exist so
utterly outside the capitalist and heteronormative timelines of
productivity, Freeman argues, represent a "queerness \[that\] consists
of a bodily difference" (18). In that way, I can return to my earlier
examples, and point to a similar queerness in the aliens that cause the
unmooring of time in the science fiction stories of Vonnegut and Chiang,
and the queerness of bodily and sexual difference that is the queerness
found in K.I.P., a queerness that has been forever altered through time
and trauma, and can never be fully regained. Watching the players, or
aliens, bring a **[[performance of queerness]{.mark}, and queer longing
[exposes us to subjectivities]{.mark} that have found space [outside of
chrononormativity, outside of the rigorous heteronormativity that is
demanded by the productivity of capitalism.]{.mark} Freeman describes
[queerness as a culture and community where its members are "of times
out of joint]{.mark} \[...\] a subjugated class" (Freeman 18). If
queerness is forever at odds with a chrononormative timelines because
queerness and queer culture do not abide by those timelines, then
[Queerness comes into being as a rejection of the state's timelines, as
a rejection of the call for reproductive and monetary productivity that
those timelines demand]{.mark}. When faced queer
performances]{.underline}**, such as K.I.P., **[we face a sense of lust
and longing and desire, for emotion and connection that is unstuck and
unmoored from how we have come to read and signify time.]{.underline}**
We become Nguyen, and Hamlet, and the players, and Stoppard, and Billy
Pilgrim, and Louise, the face pressed on top of a scene and a moment
that never included us, but always includes us, our bodies separated by
chronology but joined by longing**[[. Through its performance, its
hauntology, its existence, and its art, queerness becomes a rebellious
time machine]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In her Queer Phenomenology, Sara Ahmed argues that [a "**queer"
orientation** toward the world allows for staging a politics
**uncommitted** to the presumption that "lives have to follow certain
lines in order to count as lives, rather than being a commitment to a
**line of deviation**."]{.underline} (Ahmed 178) [Key to her argument is
a notion of "**disorientation**," described as "the '**becoming oblique'
of the world**, a becoming that is at once interior and exterior, as
that which is given]{.underline}, or as that which gives what is given
its new angle." (Ahmed 162) Although she does not claim to be utilizing
Derrida's schema from Specters of Marx, [Ahmed's contention that the
materiality of objects is revelatory due to a subject's orientation,
nonetheless captures Derridea's claim that "**haunting**" describes the
"**staging of an event**]{.underline}", [which I take to be inclusive of
both bodies and objects]{.underline}. Because such staging allows for
the appearance of past histories, I argue that Ahmed's [embodied
phenomenology materializes Derrida's notion of
**hauntology**]{.underline}. This [notion pervades Ahmed's reflections
on how (dis)orientation is revelatory through the **spectral histories**
embedded within their materiality]{.underline}. Hence, [queer
phenomenology **becomes a hauntology** that enables thinking the
**radical malleability** of sociality given its multi-textured
materiality]{.underline}. For Ahmed, [taking a queer phenomenological
orientation toward objects reveals phenomena **less clearly captured**
by the classic phenomenological model]{.underline}. This objective
history of an object's givenness remains, even if not immediately
present as pure appearance of direct experience, without reducing to a
mere representation of a purported image. Ahmed's [phenomenological
account]{.underline} is a reading that "[summons forth" **prior
histories** of the object that presently affect one's experience of (and
orientation toward) the object]{.underline}. Two of her footnotes
suggest this: she reformulates the Heideggerian and Gadamerian critiques
of the suspension of the natural attitude as an irreducibly hermeneutic
move (Ahmed 33 \[n 5\]; 184); and she references the [material culture
of matters that are "entangled" in the social relations and
**productions of signs**]{.underline}. (Ahmed 42 \[n 12\]; 187) An
object's contours present as a surface, but its past exceeds its
present(ed) givenness, constituting the object as an artifact of
socio-cultural (and thus politico-economic) production and thus allowing
disorientation to occur. For Ahmed, "[disorientation" can be understood
as an "**opening-up**" of what appearance presents as real, or simply
overlooks as something that can be ignored along the preferential
pathways laid out in normative discourse and practice. Such moments of
disorientation allow these histories to emerge more fully than in
everyday perception,]{.underline} which I claim is [a **Derridean
"hauntology**]{.underline}". For Derrida, [the logic of the ghost
"points toward a thinking of the event that necessarily **exceeds** a
binary or dialectical logic, the logic that distinguishes or opposes
effectivity or actuality]{.underline} (either present, empirical,
living---or not) and ideality (regulating or absolute nonpresence)."
(Derrida 2006: 78) The [ghost goes beyond mere present comparatives,
toward what remains real in its **non-actualized presence**]{.underline}
-- i.e., the various histories that subsist, even if not consciously
perceived, within these objects. Commenting on Marxism, one such spirit
that Derrida claims he will "never be able to renounce" is "a certain
emancipatory and messianic affirmation, a certain experience of the
promise that one can try to liberate from any dogmatics and even from
any metaphysico-religious determination, from any messianism." (Derrida
2006: 111) Without distancing too much from Derrida's specific concern,
this seems to commit him to obscuring simple perception: [To haunt does
**not** mean to be present, and it is necessary to introduce haunting
into the very construction of a concept]{.underline}. Of every concept,
beginning with the concepts of being and time. That is what we would be
calling here a hauntology. [Ontology opposes it only in a **movement of
exorcism**. Ontology is a **conjuration**.]{.underline} (Derrida 2006:
202) To use Ahmed's language, [Derrida recognizes the queerness of
Marx]{.underline} in the radical heterogeneity of Marxism, [by accepting
the heterogeneity inherited across its lineage]{.underline}. In this
sense, "[ontology" as a "conjuration" refers to a particular inherited
lineage]{.underline} (and thus, **[history]{.underline}**) [that has
been privileged as "the History", as a particular description called
forth as more definitive against others]{.underline}. [Against ontology,
**hauntology is prior**, anterior in its openness]{.underline}. [Ahmed
doesn\'t explicitly take this step of radical heterogeneity alongside
Derrida. However, her argument consists in **blurring the contours** of
mere presence in order to render the materiality of the object as a
touchstone rather than a firmament -- resisting objectivity as the
being-there of brute facticity, rendering it instead as the reference
point for instantiations]{.underline} of being-such that might occur.
With her procedure, the "thisness" of the object -- the aim of a more
traditional ontology -- is not as clearly apprehensible as Husserlian
phenomenology wishes it to be, so the spectral aspects of the object --
[that which consists in the unseen back that grounds the present, which
is itself rendered "**ghostly**]{.underline}" -- [takes that which is
"objective" to be **less absolute** than what it pretends or portends to
be]{.underline}. While not a complete break with Husserl, Ahmed
nonetheless presents a much fuzzier perception of objects: queer
phenomenology goes beyond a Husserlian eidetic approach by assuming the
persistence and presence of a contextual history for (re-)
interpretation to occur. In a moment of disorientation, Ahmed claims,
every possible objective present is revealed in an object alongside
their situational arrangements, from which Ahmed maintains one may
reorient. This [notion of phenomenology disrupts ontologizing the
objective: "mere givenness" is rejected by Ahmed as a
socio-cultural]{.underline} (and thus, political) [effect of normalizing
states of affairs through the naturalization of the preferred
orientation toward an object]{.underline}. [Disrupting the clarity of a
perceived object, negating the static object as but one moment that
appears as preferred or privileged]{.underline} -- or conveniently left
alone -- [**disrupts** the **fundamental ontological assumptions** that
normally orient the subject]{.underline}. If, for Derrida, ontology is
the conjuring that one performs at the moment of exorcism, then Ahmed's
[phenomenology effects a conjuring of occluded ontologies that
**ground** queer orientations]{.underline}, in the phenomenological
experience of disorientation. Keeping the aforementioned Derridean
reading of queerness as accepting the radical heterogeneities that
emerge across a lineage, consider the following: If a mixed genealogy
takes us back to a time before our arrival, then it reminds us how
orientations involve secrets: what we cannot uncover or recover about
the histories that allow objects to gather in the way that they do.
\[\...\] Su[ch acts of conjuring involve not only what we perceive in
the present, but also the histories out of which objects **emerge** we
might even conjure what is behind them]{.underline}. [Such histories are
**spectral** in the sense that the objects we perceive are traces of
such histories, and even keep those histories alive, but the histories
cannot simply be **perceived**]{.underline}. Indeed, such histories may
be alive insofar as they resist being converted into something that is
available, like the side that is revealed by our viewing point.\" (Ahmed
152-3) [Ontological conjuring occurs]{.underline}, for Ahmed, [in a
resuscitation of the occluded histories that remain "amidst" or
"within]{.underline}" (if not present or actualized) [objects, reviving
historical possibilities still embedded in them]{.underline}. Selecting
a particular history presages a future and dictates how that future
plays out: conjuring entails a conscientious covering-over of
alternatives. [Key to this conjuring is that the history must exceed the
present(ation) of the object; compare Derrida's claim that the ghost
emerges precisely when it seems that there is no future]{.underline}
(Derrida 2006: xviii): [a **teleological suspension** of the objective
that allows **new orientations** to emerge]{.underline}. How does this
cash out in terms of a queer politics? [Human bodies occupy the unique
situation as both agentic subjects and affected objects]{.underline}.
The situatedness of a particular body within its social, political, and
cultural arena reflects the placement of a particular being's regard
within such circumstances: "[if orientation is about making the strange
familiar through the extension of bodies into space, then disorientation
occurs when that extension fails]{.underline}." (Ahmed 11). Citing
Fanon, Ahmed notes that the corporeal schema cannot be navigated without
reference to the grid of historico-racial interpretation: such
institutions delineate our lines of motility. Pace phenomenology, when
we move and experience the (objective) world, our corporeal schema
necessarily takes the body as a part-object in a field of objects that
are situated in the field before it, within which one can(not) act or
move toward. For Ahmed, the [revelatory "**twisting**" that a queer
phenomenology effects, serves to orient a subject toward possible
futures by revealing the secret of the normative, as dependent on the
homogeneity of the **hetero (normative**), as opposed to the
heterogeneity within the queer]{.underline}. Despite its pretensions,
the hetero depends on the queer by occluding its necessity in the
generation of difference: [queerness is the **difference** from which
the norm is selected before being elevated as such]{.underline}. Hence
Ahmed's interest in "mixed" genealogies: [such a lineage disrupts the
notions of **purity** that undergird much ontologizing that occurs
within the socio-cultural sphere]{.underline}. In this sense, [one does
not have a greater claim to a primordial truth or state of affairs by
virtue of the straightest line. **Mixing functions as a hauntology**,
wherein plural ontologies that undergird and prefigure moments of
disorientation, such that alternative lineages might be conjured into
**queer expression**]{.underline}. [This mixed genealogy opens
up]{.underline} **[different possible future paths]{.underline}** [to be
taken for the subject understood as an embodied spectral
object]{.underline}, as the multiple lineages contained within mixtures
offer different trajectories that can be taken from the moment of
disorientation. For Ahmed, [an object's spectral histories are rendered
in terms of the future orientations that one can effect, coordinate, and
embody in terms of the effect that these indeterminately perceived
objective ghosts have]{.underline}. [She effectively materializes the
Derridean hauntological notion of the "to come":]{.underline} "[At
bottom, **the specter is the future**, it is always to come, it presents
itself only as that which could come or come back]{.underline}."
(Derrida 2006: 48) The [political imprimatur thus emerges: the embodied
phenomenological subject, as an inheritor of histories and an agent of
history, serves as its own spectral object; one that can affect/effect
the arrival of a future undetermined by the **putatively objective**,
via how one **orients** oneself toward various **histories** presaging
arrival]{.underline}.

Queering IR As Cynthia Weber (2014, 598) suggests, "queer IR scholars
recognize that [knowledge and ignorance in and about international
relations are intricately bound up with sexual knowledge and **sexual
ignorance**]{.underline}." [Queer research in IR tends to "track when
**queer figurations** emerge and how they are normalized and/or
perverted]{.underline}" (Weber 2014, 598). Accordingly, queer IR has
come to [**challenge** "the normalizing mechanisms of state power to
**name** its sexual subjects]{.underline}" . . . \[[to\] take account of
how "queer" is sometimes claimed in the name of **normalizing** and
**depoliticizing** understandings of sex, gender, and
sexuality]{.underline} . . . \[and to consider\] what being a Queer IR
scholar and doing Queer IR scholarship does specifically in and to the
discipline. ( Weber 2014, 599, citing Eng, Halberstam, and Munoz
2005, 1) "[Queering" IR, then, is a combination of attention to "'the
intimate' of sex/**affective relations**, marriage, kinship, and
family/household formations]{.underline}" and the ways in which [that
intimate is]{.underline} "troubled, made strange, \[and\]
**[destabilized]{.underline}**" (Peterson 2014, 605). As Lauren Wilcox
(2014, 612) describes, "projects of queering IR are not about making IR
queer as if it weren't already, but they are about how sexualities,
affiliations, and [affects are produced and **regulated** within
existing practices of IR]{.underline}." Wilcox (2014, 612) explains "the
'queer' of queer theory is necessarily an interpellation that is
open-ended toward constant self-critique and different political
projects." [Among]{.underline} these [political projects is the idea of
"'inhabiting the **practices of rearticulation'**]{.underline} w[hich
can be done by recognizing the ambivalence, indeed 'drag' of not only
homosexuality but gender generally]{.underline}" (Sjoberg 2014, 609,
citing Butler 1993, 185). This short exposition shows a couple of
important points about the project of "queering" IR. First, "queer" IR
cannot be singularly defined or stabilized as a referent from which to
plan a vision of "IR." Second, queer IR is concerned with the role of
sex and sexuality in constructing both social and political life and
knowledge of it. Third, queer IR cannot be reduced to the study of
sexuality, but instead includes understanding the queerness in global
politics: the both/and (Weber 1999) of how processes in global politics
works. This is reflected in a research program that Weber (2015) calls
"global queer studies,"1 has involved both "thinking about sex,
sexuality, and their performances on a personal, institutional, or
national scale" and using what is learned there about social dynamics
both directly and as a metaphor for the analysis of many other aspects
of global social and political life. Relatedly, fourth, [queering IR
"challenges the **heteronormative assumptions** in IR theory by arguing
that certain **actors** in global politics can be **read as
'queer**]{.underline},'" which [includes]{.underline} but is not limited
to [the ability to "defy binary classifications and **embrace
paradox**]{.underline}" (Wilcox 2014, 613). These four moves can be seen
in the two engagements with IR Constructivism below. Both
[destabilization and interrogating binary classifications are involved
in rethinking the **stability** of rule and rule, and considering
**liminality** in global politics]{.underline}. Thinking about the role
of sex and sexuality as well as the inherent queerness of global
politics, both straightforwardly and metaphorically, underlie the
proposition that the social be thought of as seductive. Destabilizing
(gender) rules and rule In Onuf's (1998, 59) account of Constructivism,
"[social rules . . . make the process by which people and society
constitute each other continuous and reciprocal]{.underline}."
[Rules,]{.underline} then "**[given agents choices]{.underline}**" and
agents in turn "[act in society to **achieve** goals]{.underline}" (Onuf
1998, 60). [Stable patterns of rules "give society a structure," which
constitutes "a condition of rule" that is "a stable pattern of
relations]{.underline}," "a [condition in which some agents use rules to
exercise control and obtain advantage]{.underline}" (Onuf 1998, 62--63).
In this view, rules and agents are co-constitutive, and rules yield a
state of rule (Onuf 1998, 64, 74). In this context, "[rule is something
that happens to agents when they follow rules or when they suffer the
consequences of not following rules]{.underline}" (Onuf 1998, 75). What
Onuf describes there can be homologized to what queer theorists often
call the process of normalization. Queer theorists (e.g., Duggan 2002;
Jackson 2006) have recognized a phenomenon called heteronormativity --
"the normalization of exclusively heterosexual desire, intimacy, and
family life" (Peterson 1999, 40). In other words, it is the structuring
of social life around values, lifestyles, and family/social structures
associated with heterosexuality. The incorporation (and co-optation) of
the homosexual into this heteronormative matrix has been identified as
"homonormativity," where the values, lifestyles, and family/social
structures expected of the hetero- are normalized into homosexuality as
well, and homosexuality is incorporated into late-capitalist,
late-modern social structures without the alteration of the latter
(Duggan 2002, 175, calling it a "sexual politics of neoliberalism").
Sarah Ahmed (2006) has suggested that the "[normalization of
heterosexuality" has produced a **requirement** to "follow a straight
line" and a tendency to "conflate this straight line with what is right,
good, or normal]{.underline}." This creates (in Foucault's \[1997\]
words) a "society of normalization" where "**[regimes of the
norm]{.underline}**al" (Eng et al. 2005, 3) [are built around a norm of
straightness, even for the non-straight]{.underline}. As Michael Warner
(1999, 56, 60, 62) explains, in these terms, "normal means certified,
approved, as meeting a set of normative standards," where "increasingly,
the answer is to have dignity gay people must be seen as normal" and [a
claim to the normal is a claim to "legitimating oneself."]{.underline}
The [heterosexual norm becomes the key to "**regimes of
intelligibility**" that create "**normalizing violence** that determines
the **subjectivity**, **survival**, and **livability**" of
subjects]{.underline} (Butler 2013). This is why queer theorists (e.g.,
Halberstam 2012) are interested in "the end of normal" even in places
where we assume that "normal is most stable." Lee Edelman (2004)
suggested that [queerness is "irreducibly linked to the 'aberrant or
**atypical**]{.underline},' to what chafes against normalization," which
motivates queer theorists to look to "unsettle the normalizing powers of
both law and kinship as always and already heteronormative" and
"regulate the distribution of vulnerability" among people (Butler 2013).
It would be easy to see heteronormativity and homonormativity as rules
that contribute to a state of rule in local, national, and global
politics. Spike Peterson's (2014, 604) description suggests that [queer
theory is in part to "contest normativities and orthodoxies]{.underline}
(Brown 2006, 886) [in part by exposing '**regimes of the
normal'**]{.underline} (Eng et al. 2005, 3) as historically contingent
and power-laden social constructions" -- in a vocabulary very similar to
Onuf's (1998) description of rules among people with uneven power. In
this view, those who fall outside of normalized understandings of
sexuality (and therefore sociality) are breaking rules and distributed
consequences by a system of rule. Looking at queer theorizing about the
process of normalization that produces those normativities, however,
produces two interventions into the Onufian Constructivist understanding
of the construction of rules and the state of rule. The first is the
violence of inclusion. Onuf suggests that, [with the existence of rules
and the state of rule, **consequences** come from
**rule-breaking**]{.underline}. Queer theorists' observations about the
insidious consequences of rule-following suggest that being "in" the
"normalized" notions of sexuality can be as harmful as (if not more
harmful than) being "out." For example, regimes of intelligibility of
sexuality often react to those who are "out" (e.g., the trans-) by
adding extra categories to those regimes of intelligibility, rather than
by recognizing the fundamental instability of those categories (e.g.,
Stryker 2008, 148). This is an exercise of fixing identity, and
perpetuating the myth that categories of sex and gender identities are
relatively independent and unchanging with clear boundaries -- it is
just necessary to normalize more of them to include all the people who
fall in all possible categories. Often, [critical Constructivists make
similar suggestions: now that "we" "know" how insidious rules work and
become institutionalized, "we" can use that knowledge to "**change**"
the **shape of the state** of rule, often with an emancipatory
politics]{.underline} (e.g., Debrix 2002; Smith 2002; Duvall and
Varadarajan 2003; Smith 2004; Price 2008). [Queer theorizing about
normalization has suggested, however, that there is significant enough
violence in the process of normalized inclusion that its use by
advocates for oppressed people should be reconsidered]{.underline}
(e.g., Agathangelou 2013; Dutta 2013; Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and Posocco
2013; Lind and Keating 2013). [Analysis of queer experiences with
normalization suggests that the violence is of the system of rules and
rule, rather than within the system -- which suggests that, rather than
simply being a "way of studying social relations]{.underline}" (Onuf
1998, 58), [a Constructivist lens can be a **tool** of oppressive social
relations]{.underline}. Second, and relatedly, this understanding of
normalization provides insight into the disciplinary power of thinking
about rules and rule to make liminality invisible. If social and
political life is structured by a complicated set of rules that create a
state of rule, which, to varying degrees, one either falls inside of or
outside of (either categorically or behaviorally), the both/and (Weber
1999) or neither/nor (Heyes 2007) becomes a sort of shade of gray rather
than a different categorization. [Butler]{.underline} (2013) [discusses
"a politics of disposability" that "can be traced in various histories
of **human liminality**]{.underline}." In Captive Genders, Steve Dillon
(2011, 179) [describes the unique positionality of "writing from within
a liminal space -- between **life** and **death**; freedom and
subjection; known and unknown; the happened and the did not
happen]{.underline}." In this view, [the liminal is neither inside nor
outside, but unrecognizable to both -- whether that liminality is gender
liminality]{.underline} (e.g., Salamon 2010) [or other liminalities made
recognizable by gender liminalities]{.underline} (Stanley and Smith
2011). [Liminalities "suggest borderlands that **defy fixed
homeplaces**]{.underline}" (Sylvester 2002, 255). Again, at first
glance, [this could "fit" into an Onufian Constructivist framework,
showing the flexibility of rules and the state of rule that they create,
and the agential intent within that flexibility]{.underline} (e.g., Onuf
1998, 59). I think that would be a misreading, [since liminality is not
a show of flexibility but a state that creates and signifies "different
subjectivities]{.underline} . . . [which we can think of as mobile,
rather than fixed, criss-crossing borderlands]{.underline}" (Sylvester
2002, 255). In other words, not only is liminality both/and and
neither/nor in practice, [the substance of the]{.underline} both/ and
and neither/nor -- the **[queered positionality of
liminality]{.underline}** -- [suggests the falseness of the dichotomy
that creates the possibility of "both."]{.underline} In gender terms, it
is not that additional categories need to be added to the "male" and
"female" to accommodate the "others" -- it is that the liminality of the
"others" shows not only the violence but the inauthenticity of both the
categories of "male" and "female" and the project of sex/gender
categorization. In Constructivist terms, [those that are both/and/
neither/nor to any given rule or state of rule show that it is not that
the rules and their rule should be interpreted as more complex or more
flexible, but instead, that an understanding of rules/rule that does not
account for both the liminal and the normalization that **erases its
subjectivity** must by definition be incomplete]{.underline}.

[Toward a Queer Politics of Fugitivity]{.underline}

As stated at the beginning, many university presidents and chancellors
have come out in tepid support of vulnerable students, and for those at
the helm of public institutions, their support comes in part because of
the mission of the public university: to educate the public, regardless
of that public's citizenship status. But for those of us teaching at
public institutions, we need to take the public mission in a slightly
different direction, that is, we need to be public about what that work
of support will entail. We need collective, public visibility that in
the tradition of [queer politics insists both, "aqui, estamos, y no nos
vamos" and "**we're here, we're queer, get used to it!"** I call on
queerness both as a **statement of queer identity**, and a signal to
most all leadership of the undocumented student movement, but also an
indication of an **in-your-face politics**. This politics **must not
prioritize legal remedies**, collude with police, or offer tepid forms
of support. About those things, we must be forthright. But that queer
politics must also be coupled with a commitment to what I can only think
of as "**fugitivity**." A long tradition of theorizing the concept of
fugitivity among radical and feminist black intellectuals traces this
line of thinking directly to Frederick Douglass and fugitive slaves. It
is important not to sever theorizing of fugitivity from its place in
black life or to make fugitivity a purely metaphorical endeavor. But
understanding fugitivity, as Christina Sharpe puts it, as "a powerful
way to imagine black life that persists in and in spite of,"8 offers
important resources for all criminalized people and their accomplices to
learn to maneuver. For people like me, people whose lives are not
constituted by being criminalized, understanding such features of black
and undocumented, and undocublack life will inform how we listen to,
transport, harbor, protect, and collude with those rendered fugitive by
unjust laws, and therefore participate in fugitivity
ourselves.]{.underline} I want to direct attention to two
conceptualizations of fugitivity that point us in the kind of directions
we may want to consider as we undertake various forms of sanctuary and
support. First, Keguro Macharia writes, "[**Fugitivity is seeing around
corners, stockpiling in crevices, knowing the "unrules," being unruly,
because the rules are never enough, and not even close.**"9
Many]{.underline} undocumented folks, perhaps especially undocublack
folks, undoubtedly live in and through this pedagogy. As Opal Tometi,
executive director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration and
cofounder of Black Lives Matter points out, because of changes to
immigration law in 1996 that broadened the range of deportable offenses
and allowed for retroactive deportations, black immigrants, who like
their citizen counterparts are more likely to be profiled by police than
other groups, have suffered the most dire consequences. Tometi explains,
"Even though black immigrants make up only 7% of the total immigrant
population, 20% of all immigrants in deportation proceedings due to
criminal convictions are black."10 Black folks are most likely to suffer
criminalization and therefore have had to discover means to know the
unrules, to see around corners and survive. This is not to say that the
perspective of fugitivity does not constitute all undocumented
experience. [All lessons of fugitivity are more vital than ever. This
moment requires accomplices to learn concretely what fugitivity means by
listening carefully to undocumented folks about how to support this way
of living and how to live in this way. Second, as Jack Halberstam noted
in the introduction to Harney and Moten's The Undercommons,
"**Fugitivity is not only escape**, 'exit' as Paolo Virno might put it,
or 'exodus' in the terms offered by Hardt and Negri, fugitivity is being
separate from settling. **It is a being in motion that has learned that
'organizations are obstacles to organising**]{.underline} ourselves'
(The Invisible Committee in The Coming Insurrection) [and that there are
spaces and modalities that exist separate from the logical, logistical,
the housed and the positioned."11 Although there is one way to read this
as an anti-institutional argument, another way to read this idea is to
remember that the undercommons is neither about being for nor against
the university. It is about being in but not of it. And therefore,
**separating ourselves** from particular kinds of positions and
positionings, ways of engaging that become predictable to institutions
and **developing new kinds of extraorganizational logics** are essential
to the practice of fugitivity I am suggesting we need. Stealing from the
university's resources, relying on it for meeting space to come together
to build other structures, while actively refusing its norms of decorum.
Making photocopies after hours, using our offices to harbor the
criminalized, and our libraries to study resistance. Teaching to
transgress, testing the limits of our academic freedom, collaborating
with the revolutionary fringe on teach-ins and actions. These are some
of the basic practices of fugitivity that this moment demands. And these
must be coupled with concrete and material plans and steps of support,
always developed from the perspectives of those most]{.underline}
impacted. I recognize that publicly insisting that we will resist
anti-immigrant laws and that we will protect our students by virtually
any means necessary is scary. [It would be a lot easier to do what we
are comfortable with---asking police to do the right thing, relying on
provisions like FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) to
protect student records, and as**king administrators to take stronger
stances.** But as what Anzaldúa calls nepantleras, those who reside in
spaces of tension and struggle to imagine, transform, and heal, **we
have a duty to imagine bigger**. One way to do this is to reimagine
sanctuary as a queer politics of fugitivity, and then collectively
imagine together what that can be.]{.underline}

**[2AC \-- Ontology]{.underline}**

**Since the [dawn of colonialism]{.underline}, queerness has existed as
the [antithesis]{.underline} to Western Empire. Heteronormativity and
reproductive futurity [structures]{.underline} history and rationalizes
the [takeover]{.underline} of an [effeminate]{.underline}, [queer third
world]{.underline}. This continues to [modernity]{.underline} with the
birth of [queer liberalism]{.underline}. Representations of [eastern
threats]{.underline} through discursive practices are [not
neutral]{.underline} but reinforce the [Western fantasy]{.underline} of
[exorcising]{.underline} the [Queer Third World]{.underline}.**

Queerness and the West According to Foucault, [[homosexuality is a
Western construct]{.mark} of the 19th century, at which time [it became
a site of systematic]{.mark} legal, religious and medical
[investigation]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 Before that period 'sodomy' and
[[same-sex relations]{.mark} did of course happen; but, though
[considered '**sinful'** and]{.mark} always [at risk of being
**suppressed**]{.mark} and harshly punished]{.underline}, such sexually
'deviant' practices also had a certain degree of social acceptance, with
even a few instances of flourishing in urban subcultures. It was only in
the late 19th century that '[[sexual perversion' began to be
scrutinised]{.mark}, classified and [pathologised (as a
**disease**]{.mark}]{.underline}), giving way to the modern notion of
homosexuality. 'The sodomite had been a temporary aberration; [[the
homosexual was now a **species'**]{.underline}]{.mark}, writes
Foucault.3 But [whether in pre-modern or modern times, queerness has a
history of marginalisation and oppression]{.underline}.
[**[Hetero-normativity]{.mark}** -- the social ordering that privileges
heterosexuality and accepts as normal and natural the complementarity
between the sexes --- [has meant the]{.mark} simultaneous [production of
sexual minorities as]{.mark} 'queer', abnormal, unnatural,
[defective]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Lee Edelman calls this
'**[reproductive futurism']{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[Western society
**sustains** itself on the promise of]{.mark} a harmonious [future by
upholding the]{.mark} **image of the [innocent child]{.mark}** [to
buttress]{.mark} social [reproduction and]{.mark} the 'absolute
**[privilege]{.mark} of [heteronormativity']{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4
[**[Generational succession is ensured]{.mark}**, then, through a
forward-looking reproductive politics of hope]{.underline}. And,
[according to such a politics, to the extent that [queers do not
procreate]{.mark}]{.underline} (at least not until the advent of in
vitro fertilisation), [[they do not **reproduce the
social**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, [[they are often seen as
**threatening**]{.mark} key social [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}:
their [lack of family orientation compromises such things as community
and civil society, while their 'sterile' and [non-reproductive
'lifestyle' **endangers**]{.mark} capitalism, which so depends on labour
and wealth [accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. No wonder, as a
consequence, that queers in the West have been subjected to torment
through the ages. One thinks here of the [[castration of
'effeminate']{.mark} young [boys in the Middle Ages]{.mark}, the
[vilification]{.mark} and persecution [of
homosexuals]{.mark}]{.underline} (as well as women, witches, Muslims,
Jews and the poor) [[during the Crusades]{.mark} and Inquisition, and
the execution of 'sodomites' under the 16th-century English Buggery
Act]{.underline}.5 [More recent, often [right-wing]{.mark} and
conservative [attacks against queers]{.mark} include the Nazi
persecution of gay men]{.underline} (alongside Jews and Gypsies),
[anti-homosexual [discrimination during McCarthy's]{.mark}
anti-communist [purge]{.mark} in the USA, and the [Anita Bryant 'Save
Our Children' crusade]{.mark} against gay rights in the
late-1970s]{.underline}. [[All speak to attempts at preserving the
social fabric]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [hence reforming or [eliminating
queers as an embodiment of the threat to]{.mark} **reproductive
[futurism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of late, [[a much more **liberal**
approach to queerness has **taken hold**]{.mark} in the
West]{.underline} (and other parts of the world, too). [Contemporary
[liberalism]{.mark} now [treats homosexuality as a **sexual
expression**]{.mark}, lifestyle and identity, granting sexual minorities
legal rights and protections]{.underline}, including gay marriage. This
[mainstreaming of LGBTI identities is reflected in liberal political
economy as well, [with queers **targeted by mass-media**]{.mark} and
lifestyle marketing. '**Out is In'**, or so the slogan
goes]{.underline}. Rather than being treated as a limit or threat to the
social, [the [queer]{.mark} non-reproductive [lifestyle is now a
**marketing**]{.mark} and consumer [opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But, as several queer theorists have been quick to point out,6 [[such
'**queer liberalism'**]{.mark} tends to **[leave hetero-normativity
intact]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It deals with sex as a personal or civil
rights issue, thus [**avoiding** broader **structural change**]{.mark}.
In fact, far from posing a threat to the social order, [queer liberalism
helps **reinforce** it]{.mark}: it continues to [uphold reproductive
futurism]{.mark} by [buttressing the **institutions** of]{.mark}
marriage, [family]{.mark}, domesticity and nation, while also
strengthening and [promoting hetero]{.mark}-patriarchal global
[capitalism]{.mark} through niche marketing and
consumerism]{.underline}. Queering the Third World [It should come as no
surprise that]{.underline}, before decolonisation, [the [discursive
representations of queerness]{.mark} in the West [found their way
into]{.mark} European [colonial representations of the **Third
World**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Indeed, as several postcolonial
analysts have argued,7 [**[colonial]{.mark} [domination]{.mark}** was
often [justified]{.mark} and exercised [through]{.mark} various forms of
**[homophobia]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as well as sexism and racism).
[[Queering the Third World enabled the coloniser to distinguish
himself]{.mark} from the colonised, [buttressing]{.mark} his
**masculinity** and **[social respectability]{.mark}** and, as a result,
rationalising both his 'civilising mission]{.underline}' and denigration
of local culture. Thus, [early colonial reports represented
[Amerindians]{.mark} in Colombia [as **sexual deviants**]{.mark} and
degenerates, engaging in 'bestiality, sodomy, incest, and other
unnatural practices']{.underline}. 8 Similarly 16th and 17th century
[European travel journals referred to [Africans as
']{.mark}hot-tempered' and '**[lascivious']{.mark}**, 9 with historian
and colonial administrator]{.underline}, Edward Long, describing African
women as 'libidinous\...monkeys'. 10 [Black men and women were
frequently reduced to their bodies]{.underline} (or to animality),
lacking cognitive abilities or self-control, and invariably depicted as
unintelligible, deceptive and dishonest.11 In this regard, Eve Sedgwick,
writing about the 'closet' in modern Western culture, claims that the
[hetero/homo [**binary** was]{.mark} often [**intertwined** with]{.mark}
the knowledge/ignorance binary, so that secrecy, opacity and
[deceitfulness]{.mark} were [**associated** with
homosexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 Such
[[associations]{.underline}]{.mark}, it seems, [[circulated]{.mark} well
[in the **racialised colonial context**]{.mark}, too]{.underline}. It
was not uncommon for the sexualisation of the Third World to resort to
various forms of misogyny (as evidenced by the Edward Long quote above).
Anne [McClintock coins the term '**[porno-tropics']{.mark}** to
[describe how colonised lands were labelled '**virgin territories'** to
rationalise]{.mark} their [take-over]{.mark}]{.underline} (or their
'penetration' or 'rape'[), while at the same time [representing]{.mark}
their [inhabitants]{.mark}, and especially native women, [as **sexually
promiscuous**]{.mark} and voracious]{.underline}.13 [[Native
men]{.underline}]{.mark}, for their part, if they were not being
directly portrayed as 'sodomites', [were often symbolically castrated by
being [labelled '**effeminate'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 Mrinalini
Sinha shows, in this regard, how [the stereotype of the [effeminate
Bengali helped **secure** ]{.mark}**the British self-image** of
masculinity and justify the continued [British presence in India]{.mark}
in the late 19th-century, for example by helping
[rebuff]{.mark}]{.underline} (emasculate?) [Indian [demands for]{.mark}
greater access to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 The [[theme of **sexual
perversity**]{.mark} and the myth of the '**erotic East'** are [repeated
in a plethora of **writings**]{.mark} about the Orient by European
adventurers, travellers, geographers, anthropologists and
administrators.]{.underline}16 Often [it is Arab and Muslim cultures
that are depicted as sexually promiscuous]{.underline}, with much of the
writing [presenting them as tolerating and even propagating such
'aberrant' practices as sodomy]{.underline}.17 Of particular note is
[the work of late 19th-century adventurer explorer Richard
[Burton]{.mark}, who [hypothesised]{.mark} that there is a '**[Sotadic
Zone']{.mark}**]{.underline} [stretching from Southern Europe, the
Middle East and Africa to Asia-Pacific and the Southern 'New World',
[where **sexual perversion** is **endemic**]{.mark} thanks to the warm
climate]{.underline}. He claimed that this Sotadic Zone was rife with
'debaucherie' and 'erotic perversion', and that pederasty (referred to
as 'Le Vice contre nature') was practised alongside bestiality,
cannibalism, infanticide and prostitution.18 Of course, [representations
such as Burton's amounted not simply to naive orientalist exoticism; as
suggested above, homophobia, misogyny and racism served as important
**technologies** to support and **[advance colonial
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this connection Anne Stoler talks about
racialised sexual hierarchies established in the Dutch Indies between
colonialists and natives -- how strict laws were constructed to
distinguish all-white from mixed couples, and 'pure breeds' from the
progeny of mixed marriages or cohabitation.19 According to Richard
Philips, [such [sexual control]{.mark} was also present in the British
Empire during the Victorian period,]{.underline} with carefully
thought-out rules regulating sexual relationships among and between
Britishers and locals. [These covered everything]{.underline} from
marriage, cohabitation and consensual sex to prostitution, 'buggery' and
sexual diseases, all [aimed at [ensuring ']{.mark}moral' and **[social
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}20 In a similar vein Glen Elder argues in
the South African context that colonial domination reflected pervasive
anxieties about homosexual relations among and between Whites and
Blacks. Such anxieties were visible, for example, [in the geographic
ordering of apartheid, with **clearly demarcated** and strictly enforced
spatial and discursive divisions]{.underline} (eg between Black miners'
dormitories and White family residential estates, or between the
ethnicised Bantustans or Black township ghettos and the White inner city
neighbourhoods).21 The [sexualisation and [queering of the Third
World]{.mark} thus [helped **discursively construct** the Third
World]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is what Edward Said famously called
Orientalism. On the one hand, as Said points out, such a [construction
had 'less to do with the Orient than it \[did\] with "**our" \[Western\]
world'**]{.underline}. 22 To be sure, [the colonisers were acting out
their own European homophobic]{.underline} (and other) [prejudices and
representations in the colonies.]{.underline} [The [Third World
served,]{.mark} in this sense, [as a screen onto which **Western
colonial sexual fantasies**]{.mark}, desires and **anxieties** [were
being **projected**]{.mark} or transferred]{.underline}.23 But, on the
other hand, [[these were not **neutral**]{.mark} prejudices and
**[representations]{.mark}**; they had material and institutional
consequences]{.underline}. [Racist homophobia [resulted in physical
violence]{.mark} against the colonised]{.underline},24 [while colonial
sexual control, as we saw above, yielded enforceable laws, **[social
hierarchies]{.mark}** and geographic demarcations]{.underline}. The
**[[Third World]{.mark} was thus [produced as
queer]{.mark}]{.underline}**: not in the sense of the West imposing
homosexuality on the colonies (quite the opposite), but in the Saidian
sense of Orientalism as the 'enormously systematic discipline by which
European culture was able to manage -- and even produce -- the Orient'.
25 [Regardless of whether the Third World actually was 'queer', it was
**represented**, regulated and disciplined as such]{.underline}. Given
these material and institutional impacts, it is little wonder that the
[colonial [queering]{.mark} of the Third World has [had **enduring
legacies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is [evident]{.mark} perhaps no
more so than [in]{.mark} the field of **[international
development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [the very notion of
development stages 'traditional' societies as pathological]{.underline},
that is, [deviating from what is taken as the natural progression
towards (Western) capitalist modernity]{.underline}. [What is remarkable

global business]{.underline}. The solution to such feebleness and
failure is usually structural adjustment and debt relief, which many
countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have been coerced into
accepting. These frequently entail severe 'austerity' measures (fiscal
'discipline', budget slashing, privatisation, market liberalisation) and
a heavy dose of browbeating (the need for economic 'correctness' and
sound policy, 'good' governance, and greater transparency and
anti-corruption rules). [Through a queer lens this all looks like an

These three very different figurations of "homosexuality" and "the
homosexual" matter not simply because they mark major historical shifts
in dominant Western perspective on "the homosexual" and "homosexuality."
They also illustrate how [specific figurations of "homosexuality" and
"the homosexual" make it (im)possible for Western "experts" to
categorize people and geopolitical spaces as normal or
pathological---and to react to them accordingly.]{.underline} Indeed,
[specific figurations of "homosexuality" and of "the homosexual" enable
and contest specific modes of organization and regulation of national,
regional, and international politics.]{.underline} For example,
[figurations of "the savage, the primitive, the colonized"]{.underline}
(Stoler 1995:7) [and "the underdeveloped"]{.underline} (Hoad 2000) [all
appear in Victorian colonial discourse as sexualized and racialized
degenerate and/or deviant "perverse homosexuals."]{.underline} These
figurations played a role in [licensing Victorian sovereign states to
subject entire colonialized populations to imperial rule]{.underline},
as Stoler's (1995) [analysis of colonial educational practices
illustrates. Traces of these figurations linger in contemporary Western
figurations of "the unwanted im/migrant" and "the terrorist," which
inform policies on immigration and security]{.underline} (Puar and Rai
2002; Puar 2007; Luibhe´id 2008). [Figurations of "the homosexual" as
"the LGBT" justified the Obama administration's global support for gay
rights as human rights. This support both promised to extend human
rights to all "LGBT populations"]{.underline} (Langlois 2015:28, 34) and
[justified the Obama administration's monitoring of how some states
performed against US standards of tolerance toward "the
LGBT"]{.underline} (Rao 2012). Finally[, figurations of "the homosexual"
as normal and/or perverse sparked debate in contemporary Europe about
how the (dis)ordering of sex, gender, and sexuality in traditional
binary terms might progress or imperil Europe]{.underline} "itself." In
these debates, European leaders "weaponized" Neuwirth/Wurst (Black 2014)
by deploying some elements of Neuwirth/Wurst's "unstoppable unity" to
enable or disable specific renderings of European integration and of
Europe "itself." Yet because there were at least three legitimate
readings of Neuwirth/ Wurst circulating in debates about
Europe---Neuwirth/ Wurst as normal, Neuwirth/Wurst as perverse, and
Neuwirth/Wurst as normal and/or perverse---attempts to use
Neuwirth/Wurst to anchor any singular vision of an integrated Europe did
as much to disorder (knowledge about) European integration as they did
to order it/them. Because [policymakers occasionally employ these
figurations to construct and legitimate how they order international
politics and tame anarchy, figurations of "homosexuality" and "the
homosexual" participate in constructing "sexualized orders of
international relations"--- international orders that are necessarily
produced through various codings of sex, gender, and sexuality. Such
encodings carry with them practical empirical consequences for
individuals, populations, nation-states, and the conduct of foreign
policy.]{.underline} Viewed through queer intellectual curiosity, [a
plethora of sexualized and queered IR figurations, as well as their
stakes for IR, comes into focus.]{.underline} These include how
figurations of Thai "ladyboys" function in international sex trafficking
and "the asexual Japanese couple" inform domestic and international
scenarios that link sexual and economic (re)production. But less
familiar to IR audiences might be the growing body of Queer IR
scholarship that analyzes less [obviously sexualized and queered IR
figurations: "the terrorist"]{.underline} (Puar and Rai 2002; Weber
2002; Puar 2007), ["the torturer"]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit 2014),
"[the slave"]{.underline} (Agathangelou 2014), ["the nationally bordered
body"]{.underline} (Weber 1998a,b; Sjoberg 2014; Peterson 2014), ["the
human rights holder" (]{.underline}Rao 2014; Wilkinson and Langlois
2014; Picq and Thiel 2015), "the revolutionary state and citizen" (Weber
1999; Lind and Keating 2013), and "the homosexual" more generally (Weiss
and Bosia 2014). Together, these analyses demonstrate how, for example,
([inter)national conjunctures of homophobia (fearing "the homosexual")
and "homoprotectionism"]{.underline} (protecting "the homosexual;" Lind
and Keating 2014[) complicate IR theories and practices about/of war and
peace, state and nation formation, and international political
economy.]{.underline} Available space prevents a discussion of each
sexualized and queer IR figuration and its importance in IR. Thus, I
limit my analysis to the three illustrations that open this article:
Victorian colonial practices, Obama administration foreign policy
leveraging of gay rights as human rights, and EU Euro-vision debates
about Neuwirth/ Wurst. I do so for three reasons. First, each
illustrates a different alignment of "homosexuality" with (ab)normality,
producing three distinct sexualized figurations of "the homosexual" for
analysis---the perverse Victorian "homosexual," the normal Obama
administration "homosexual," and the normal and/or perverse
Euro-visioned "homosexual." Second, separately and together these
examples demonstrate that by placing a queer intellectual curiosity
about figurations of "homosexuality" and "the homosexual" at its
methodological core, this particular [Queer IR method does more than
just "add (homo)sexuality" to IR. It offers ways to map phenomena as
diverse as colonialism, human rights, and the formation of states and
international communities that provide vastly different renderings of
international politics than those that emerge when we include a
"sexuality variable" in our survey research instruments, for
example.]{.underline} In this article, I develop two theoretical and
methodological approaches that put a queer intellectual curiosity about
"homosexuality" and "the homosexual" at the core of their investigations
of IR. I develop one such approach by mining classic texts in Queer
Theory, Feminist Technoscience Studies, Poststructuralist International
Relations, and Queer International Relations for theoretical concepts
and methodological procedures. Specifically, I use Michel Foucault's The
History of Sexuality, Volume 1 (1980) to recover [three specific
elements from his analysis: putting sex into discourse, productive
power, and networks of power/knowledge/pleasure]{.underline}. I suggest
that these elements---together with Feminist Technoscience Studies
scholar Donna Haraway's [conceptualization of "figuration" as the
distillation of shared meanings in forms or images]{.underline} (1997),3
Feminist and Queer Theory scholar Judith [Butler's theory of
performativity]{.underline} (1999), and Poststructuralist IR scholar
Richard Ashley's [arguments about "statecraft as mancraft"
(1989)---provide the necessary concepts and devices to analyze
figurations of "the homosexual" and sexualized orders of IR that are
inscribed in international discourse and practice as either normal or
perverse]{.underline}. These t[heories]{.underline} in combination
generate important research questions, but they [neglect to analyze
plural figures]{.underline} like Neuwirth/Wurst [that defy
categorization as either normal or perverse. They therefore lack the
tools to assess the sexualized (dis)orders of IR to which such
categorizations give rise.]{.underline} In a second reading of these
theories---especially Ashley's statecraft as mancraft---I attempt to
correct this oversight by turning to Roland Barthes' logic of a
pluralized and/or (1974, 1976). Barthes offers instructions for [reading
plural figures and logics that signify as normal and/or perverse through
what can be vast matrices of sexes, genders, and sexualities. I view
those plural figures and logics that are constructed in relation
to---but not necessarily exclusively through---sexes, genders, and
sexualities as queer.]{.underline} In doing so, I follow Eve Sedgwick's
description of queer [as "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps,
overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses, and excesses of meaning
when the constituent elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's sexuality
aren't made (or can't be made) to signify monolithically"
(1993]{.underline}:8). Reading Ashley's statecraft as mancraft with
Barthes' [queer logic of a pluralized and/or, I propose an additional
lens through which to investigate figurations of "the homosexual,"
sovereign man, sovereign states, and sexualized orders of IR---what I
call "queer logics of statecraft."]{.underline} Some may view these
Queer IR methods as additional instruments in IR's conceptual toolbox
"for organizing empirical material and practical research designs"
(Aradau and Huysmans 2013:2; also see Jackson 2011). Others may see them
as lacking the status of proper or unique methods. They might understand
them as a queer lens attached primarily to feminist and
poststructuralist techniques (Plummer 2003:520). Still others may
understand them as [performative devices "experimentally connecting and
assembling fragments of ontology, epistemology, theories, techniques and
data" through which "substantive worlds" are called into being and are
acted upon]{.underline} (Aradau and Huysmans 2013:3, 18). Regardless,
engagement with Queer IR methods enriches how we analyze core IR
concerns like hierarchy and anarchy (Lake 2009; Bially Mattern
forthcoming). [Queer IR methods broaden our thinking about how to study
a wide array of IR mobilizations of normality, perversion, and
stigma]{.underline} (Towns 2010; Zarakol 2011; Adler-Nissen 2014).
Scholars might consider [how "the homosexual"---]{.underline} like "the
woman"---[becomes another "standard of civilization"]{.underline} (Hoad
2000; Puar 2007; Rao 2014; Towns 2014). They might challenge the
incorporation of "homosexuality" into IR as primarily "a sexuality
variable" (Weber 1998a). Or they might ponder the intellectual and
political effects of employing critical methods in IR and in
international politics (Aradau and Huysmans 2013). In my view, these
Queer IR methods make especially plural figures and plural logics easier
to identify and analyze. They thereby highlight the roles of plural
figures and plural logics in the organization, regulation, and conduct
of international politics. [Queer IR methods hold the potential to
disrupt intellectual practices that either exclude or a priori fix
understandings of "the homosexual" and other plural
figures]{.underline}---from "the woman" (Enloe 2004; Towns 2014) to "the
human rights holder" (Wilkinson and Langlois 2014) [to variously
normalized and/or stigmatized subjectivities]{.underline} (Zarakol 2011;
Adler-Nissen 2014)---[as a condition for the conduct of
research.]{.underline}

Developing Queer IR Methods Discourse, Productive Power, and Networks of
Power/Knowledge/ Pleasure Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality
Volume 1 (hereafter HoS) instructs its readers how to analyze modern
sexuality by offering four primary recommendations: 1. Analyze how sex
is put into discourse; 2. Analyze [the functions and effects of
productive power;]{.underline} 3. Understand [productive power as
working through networks of power/knowledge/pleasure]{.underline}; and
4. Analyze how [understandings of "the normal" and "the perverse" are
frozen, without assuming they are either true or forever
fixed.]{.underline} In this section, I offer a reading of HoS that draws
out these instructions. All of these instructions follow from Foucault's
central claim in HoS that [the organizing principle of sexuality from
18th-century Europe to "the contemporary West" is how "sex is 'put into
discourse'"]{.underline} (Foucault 1980:11), for example[, how specific
meanings of sexualities and sexual subjectivities are produced through
specific---even repressive---discursive formulations that bring
sexualities like "homosexuality" and sexual subjectivities like "the
homosexual" into being. For]{.underline} while [Victorian institutions
from law to medicine certainly repressed "deviant" sexual practices and
sexuality, in so doing they also discursively invented both sexual norms
and the "sexual deviants" who defied them]{.underline}. Foucault's
"Instruction 1" follows from this observation---analyze how sex is put
into discourse. How specifically did Victorians put sex into discourse?
Foucault's answer is [through scientific discourses about sexuality---a
"scientia sexualis" including biology, physiology, and psychology---that
sought to make "the homosexual body" confess its scientific
truth]{.underline}. "Scientia sexualis," Foucault claims, functioned as
[a kind of productive power to invent "the homosexual" and other sexual
figurations]{.underline} like "the hysterical woman" and "the
masturbating child" during the Victorian era. This is why Foucault
offers us "Instruction 2"---analyze the functions and effects of
productive power. How specifically did productive power work to figure
"the homosexual"? [Working on every surface of "the homosexual body" and
penetrating deep into "the homosexual soul," theologians, doctors, and
psychiatrists medicalized, surveilled, and managed "the
homosexual."]{.underline} Their biopolitical apparatuses produced "the
alien strain" of "the homosexual" as scientific fact (Foucault 1980:42--
44, 53--73). ["The homosexual," then, was not a discovery whose
empirical reality Victorian scientists examined. Rather, it was through
the scientific examination of his "sexual deviance" and the therapeutic
correction he was subjected to that Victorian society brought "the
homosexual" into being.]{.underline} This scientifically produced
"homosexual" was [prescribed a regimen of normalization, presumably to
make possible his sexual reconstitution from one who desired perverse
sex4 to one who desired normal sex, where normal sex was represented by
the presumptively white, Christian, bourgeois, able-bodied,
cis-gendered, procreative heterosexual "Malthusian couple."]{.underline}
But what this regime of normalization also did was subject "the
homosexual" to constant surveillance, management, and correction. This
is how "the homosexual" was located in a complex nexus of what Foucault
calls the system of power/knowledge/pleasure. This brings us to
Foucault's "Instruction 3"---understand productive power as working
through networks of power/knowledge/pleasure. Why did Victorian society
invent "the homosexual," diagnose individuals as afflicted with
"homosexuality," and subject them to processes of normalization?
Foucault offers several reasons. One reason is that "[the homosexual"
(like other perverse Victorian figures) made it possible to identify
normal sexual behavior, discursively implant normality in the
procreative heterosexual Malthusian couple, and circulate social
understandings of this couple as exemplary of normal, healthy, moral
Victorian sexuality.]{.underline} Thus, a [perverse/normal dichotomy
produced all manner of Victorian sexual subjectivities and organized
them socially, scientifically, and morally in ways that made the
"normal," privileged heterosexual procreative couple appear to be
coherent and whole.]{.underline} It is only by abandoning what Foucault
calls "the repressive hypothesis"---"the hypothesis that modern
industrial societies ushered in an age of increased sexual repression"
(Foucault 1980:49)---that we can appreciate how systems of
power/knowledge/pleasure actually function. "Pleasure and power do not
cancel or turn back against one another; they seek out, overlap, and
reinforce one another. They are linked together by complex mechanisms
and devices of excitation and incitement" (Foucault 1980:48). What they
make possible are figurations of sexualized subjects like "the
homosexual" as well as "institutions, structures of understanding, and
practical orientations that make \[normative sexualities like\]
heterosexuality seem not only coherent---that is, organized as a
sexuality---but also privileged" (Berlant and Warner 1998:548, footnote
2; my brackets).5 Foucault takes seriously the question "who is 'the
homosexual'?", then, not so he can get to "the truth" about "the
homosexual" but to understand how [systems of power/ knowledge/pleasure
function to produce the "perverse homosexual" and his "opposite,"
"normal" Malthusian couple.]{.underline} This makes possible exploration
of the circulation of these apparent representations in intimate as well
as national, regional, and international contexts. For example, we can
explore how our knowledge of "the underdeveloped" as perverse and "the
LGBT" as normal is in part produced by/through some of the same
scientific systems of power/knowledge/pleasure that produce "the
perverse homosexual" and "the normal homosexual," respectively. In IR,
we see this in how [Modernization and Development Theory draws upon
Talcott Parson's structural-functionalist evolutionary sociology to mark
"the underdeveloped" as "the perverse homosexual" who is the deviant,
dysfunctional remainder of social, biological, and political
development]{.underline} (Weber 2016). This is in contrast to how Hilary
Clinton [extends "the normal" to include "the LGBT couple" that is
reproductive for their nation-state, to refigure "the perverse
homosexual" as "the normal homosexual"]{.underline} (Clinton 2011; also
see Peterson 2014). What disconcerts many scholars and statespeople is
how Neuwirth/Wurst combines aspects "the perverse, underdeveloped
homosexual" (for example, as the rural Colombian Conchita Wurst) and
"the normal, developed homosexual" (for example, as the European "LGBT")
at the same time. Foucault's "Instruction 4"---analyze how
[understandings of "the normal" and "the perverse" are frozen, without
assuming they are either true or forever fixed]{.underline}---exposes
figurations of "the homosexual" as "the underdeveloped," "the LGBT," and
"the Euro-visioned bearded drag queen" [not as true or false but as
powerful apparent representations whose meanings and functions vary
radically throughout history and across the globe.]{.underline}
Foucault's genealogical method highlights the changeable nature of
figurations of "the homosexual," by focusing on different historical
representations of "the homosexual" and [asking "How did these very
different understandings of 'the homosexual' as, for example, the
Victorian sexual and developmental 'primitive' or 'underdeveloped' and
the Obama administration's norm]{.underline}al ['LGBT' come
about?"]{.underline} Yet because Foucault's instructions about analyzing
modern sexuality and sexual subjectivities are very sweeping, it is
useful to look to additional theorists to provide more precise concepts
and devices. In this vein, I turn to Donna Haraway's Butlerian
theorization of figuration.

**Homosexuality is a signifier of worldmaking that overdetermines
modernity's operationalization of racializations and colonialism**

What exactly might we look for when we examine figurations of "the
homosexual"? Writing in a very different context to Foucault's,6 Donna
[Haraway discusses some specific techniques of "figuration" that allow
us to employ figuration as a critical conceptual devise]{.underline}
(Kuntsman 2009:29). Haraway's conceptualization of figuration--- which
is compatible with Foucault's analysis and [builds upon Butler's notion
of performativity---can help us explore in more detail the figure of
"the homosexual." Figurations are distillations of shared meanings in
forms or images. They do not (mis)represent the world, for to do so
implies the world as a signified preexists them. Rather, figurations
emerge out of discursive and material semiotic assemblages that condense
diffuse imaginaries about the world into specific forms or images that
bring specific worlds into being.]{.underline} This makes figurations
[powerful signifiers that approximate but never properly represent
seemingly signified worlds, even though figurations are evoked as if
they did represent preexisting worlds.]{.underline} It is this latter
move that [reifies figurations and the worlds they create, making both
potentially "flat, unproductive, stifling and destructive"]{.underline}
(Grau 2004:12; McNeil 2007). This is why we need techniques like
Haraway's to analyze precisely how figurations are crafted and employed.
Haraway explains figuration as the employment of semiotic tropes that
[combine knowledge, practices, and power to (in)form how we map our
worlds and understand the actual things in those worlds]{.underline}
(1997).7 Unpacking Haraway's description, we are left with four key
elements through which [figurations take specific forms: tropes,
temporalities, performativities, and worldings]{.underline} (1997:11).
Tropes are material and semiotic expressions of actual things that
express how we understand those actual things. Tropes are figures of
speech that are not "literal or self-identical" to what they describe
(Haraway 1997:11). Figures of speech enable us to express what something
or someone is like while (potentially) at the same time grasping that
the figuration is not identical to the figure of speech we have
employed. This is what makes figuration something that both makes
representation appear to be possible and interrupts representation in
any literal sense. Haraway argues that language necessitates deployment
of figuration and its inability to achieve literal representations. This
is because all types of language---whether textual, visual,
artistic---involve "at least some kind of displacement that can trouble
identifications and certainties" (Haraway 1997:11) between a figure and
an actual thing. [Investigating figurations of "the homosexual" as "an
alien species" to the Victorians as opposed to "the homosexual," as "the
LGBT rights holder" to the Obama administration, and as both "an alien
species" and "the normal LGBT rights holder]{.underline}" in the figure
of Neuwirth/ Wurst [allows analysis of what makes these figurations
possible but also what keeps them from referring to specific material
bodies engaged in specific forms of sexual practices, specific forms of
loving, or specific forms of (singular) being.]{.underline} Haraway's
second element of figuration is temporalities. Temporality expresses a
relationship to time. Haraway notes that [figurations are historically
rooted in progressive, eschatological temporality because they are
embedded within "the semiotics of Western Christian
realism."]{.underline} Because Western Christian figures hold the
promise of salvation in the afterlife, they embody this progressive
temporality (Haraway 1997:9). [This medieval notion of developmental
temporality persists as a vital aspect of (some) contemporary
figurations,]{.underline} even when contemporary figures take secular
forms (for example, when it is science, not God, that promises to
deliver us from evil through technological innovation; Haraway 1997:10).
But this developmental time may not be applied to every figuration in
the same way. For example, because the [Victorian "homosexual" was
figured not only through European scientific discourses but also through
discourses of race and colonialism]{.underline} (Stoler 1995), how "the
homosexual" was [related to developmental temporalities depended very
much on who it was (colonizer vs. savage) and where it was (Europe vs.
the colonies).]{.underline} It was in part [thanks to how developmental
temporalities were racialized]{.underline} (Stoler 1995) and spatialized
(Hoad 2000) that it was possible for [the white Western European
"homosexual" to be put on a course of progressive correction so he could
live within Victorian society, while figurations of whole populations of
racially darkened colonial subjects endlessly oscillated between the
irredeemable "non-progressive homosexual" and the redeemable "morally
perfectible homosexual"]{.underline} (Bhabha 1994:118), [both of whom
must live under Victorian imperial rule.]{.underline} Centuries later,
[these racialized and colonial legacies of "the homosexual" live
on]{.underline}, but in ways that appear to be completely different from
those of their Victorian predecessors. For example, Clinton's "LGBT
rights holder" is not cast as progressing. Rather[, "the LGBT" is a
temporally static figure articulated in universal moral
terms.]{.underline} By definition, this figure always was and always
will be a human being like every other human being. This is what
empowers "the LGBT" to claim gay rights as human rights, as every human
being has a claim to human rights. This does not mean that a
developmental temporality is absent from Obama administration discourse
on "the LGBT." Rather, [developmental temporality is central to Obama
administration discourse,]{.underline} albeit differently than it was to
the Victorians. [This is because developmental temporality is not
implanted in the figure of "the LGBT" itself. Instead, it is located in
relations between sovereign nation-states, where the Obama
administration uses a state's progress toward their appreciation of gay
rights as human rights as their measure of development.]{.underline}
This is evident in US policies toward Uganda and Russia, for example
(Rao 2015; Wilkinson and Langlois 2014). Striving toward this specific
kind of development is what it means to the Obama administration "to be
on the right side of history" (Clinton 2011; also see Rao 2012). It is,
somewhat surprisingly, Tom Neuwirth's Euro-pop bearded drag queen
Conchita Wurst that most [closely engages with Western Christian realism
and its progressive, eschatological temporality as described by
Haraway.]{.underline} While Neuwirth/Wurst's declaration, "We're
unstoppable," aligns Neuwirth/Wurst with a modern progressive
developmental temporality, as a cis-male styled with long flowing hair
and a beard while wearing a gown and singing "Rise like a Phoenix,"
Neuwirth/Wurst has been read as a resurrected Christ-like figure (Ring
2014). This has led some European political and religious leaders to
debate whether Neuwirth/ Wurst is a developmental vision of salvation or
sacrilege for contemporary Europe (Weber 2016). These differences in how
figurations of "the homosexual" relate to temporalities underscore the
importance of Haraway's third element---p[erformativities]{.underline}.
Coined by Judith Butler to explain how sexes, genders, and sexualities
appear to be normal, natural, and true, the term performativity
[expresses how repeated iterations of acts constitute the subjects who
are said to be performing them]{.underline} (Butler 1999:xv). Applying
Nietzsche's idea that there is no doer behind the deed and that the deed
is everything (1999:33) to an analysis of sexes, genders, and
sexualities, Butler argues that [enactments of gender make it appear as
if sex---which Butler understands as a social construct---is natural and
normal, and as if particular sexed bodies map "naturally" onto
particular genders.]{.underline} It is through the everyday inhabiting
of these various sexes, genders, and sexualities by everyday people who
performatively enact them that the subjectivities of these doers of sex,
gender, and sexuality appear to come into being. This does not mean
that---once enacted---performativities freeze sexed, gendered, and
sexualized subjectivities and the networks of power and pleasure which
are productive of them. Rather, because each enactment is itself
particular, it holds the possibility of reworking, rewiring, and
resisting both "frozen" notions of sex, gender, and sexuality and their
institutionalized organizations of power. Following Butler, Haraway
argues that "\[f\]igurations are performative images that can be
inhabited" (Haraway 1997:11). [In the case of the Victorian
"homosexual," "the LGBT rights holder," and "the Euro-pop bearded drag
queen," this means these figurations---these figures of speech---through
their repetition under specific conditions come to be understood as
inhabitable images of oneself]{.underline} (or, for example, one's
vision of Europe) or of others. ["The homosexual" may choose to
performatively inhabit these figurations, or this inhabiting might be
imposed upon "the homosexual."]{.underline} For example, it is hard to
imagine the Victorian "homosexual" willingly embracing himself as
"perverse." It is even harder to imagine colonial subjects embracing
their figuration by Victorians as akin to the "homosexual" in their
perversion while distinct from the "homosexual" because [their
racialization and "primitiveness" designate them as incapable of
progression or slow to progress.]{.underline} In contrast, the
contemporary figuration of "the homosexual" as "the LGBT" may seem to be
uncontroversially positive. Many "homosexuals" welcome the opportunity
to inhabit the image of "[the LGBT rights holder" because of how it
appears to signify both normality and progress.]{.underline} At the same
time, other contemporary "homosexuals" find the image of "the LGBT
rights holder" too constraining. Their objections center on how "[the
LGBT" is produced by and is productive of institutions, structures of
understanding,]{.underline} and practical orientations that value only
hetero/homonormative ways of being "homosexual" (in marriage, the
military, and consumption) and [devalue queer ways of inhabiting one's
sexuality]{.underline} (Duggan 2003:50), illustrating [a tension between
IR conceptualizations of norms as uniformly beneficial]{.underline} (for
example, Finnemore and Sikkink 1998) [and queer critiques of
norms/normalization]{.underline}. As for Neuwirth/Wurst, by both
embracing and exceeding hetero/homonormativities, his/her/their
performative figuration complicates both "the LGBT" and a hetero/
homonormative vs. queer dichotomy. These illustrations suggest
figurations are never stable. [For every performance of a figuration
depends upon innumerable particularities, including historical
circumstances, geopolitical context, spatial location, social/
psychic/affective/political dispositions as well as perceived/attributed
traits (racial, sexual, classed, gendered, \[dis\]abled) of individuals
in relation to the figurations they are presumed to inhabit, an
individual's success, failure, or jamming of their assigned/assumed
figuration as they performatively enact it, and how these
performativities are received and read by others]{.underline}. Because
no two performative enactments are ever identical (Butler 1999), every
repetition and inhabitation introduces some, even tiny, amount of
difference. What this means for figurations of "the homosexual" is they
are never completely frozen, for they are always only distilled forms or
images that change---even in small ways---through their every iteration
and inhabitation. Therefore, [institutional arrangements of
power/knowledge/pleasure---be they heteronormativities and/or
homonormativities---are likewise less stable than they appear to
be.]{.underline} All of these aspects of performativity---in combination
with how tropes and temporalities are deployed---combine to produce the
final element of figuration---worlding (in IR, see Agathangelou and Ling
2004). Worlding "map\[s\] universes of knowledge, practice, and power"
(Haraway 1997:11). In the cases of the Victorian "homosexual," the Obama
administration's "LGBT rights holder," and European debates over
Neuwirth/Wurst, knowledge about these figurations, the way they are
performatively put into practice, and the power relations running
through them combine so differently in each case that it is sometimes
difficult to remember that we are speaking about the same general
figure---"the homosexual." The sometimes extreme differences in how the
figure of "the homosexual" is worlded emphasizes another of Haraway's
points---[the maps produced by worlding practices are as contestable as
the figurations to which they give specific form]{.underline} (1997:11).
In Foucault's terms, [this means neither understandings of "the
homosexual" nor the networks of power/knowledge/pleasure that produce
this figure are ever frozen]{.underline}. Rather, they are [products "of
the encroachment of a type of power on bodies and their pleasures\...
\[that define\] new rules for the game of powers and
pleasures"]{.underline} (Foucault 1980:48). These games are played not
only in intimate relations but also in national, regional, and
international relations.

Statecraft as Mancraft Combining Foucault's insights about discourse and
productive power with Haraway's Butlerian unpacking of figuration makes
it possible to offer a more nuanced account of the figuration of "the
homosexual." By layering this analysis with Richard Ashley's "statecraft
as mancraft," what comes into sharper focus is [how states (and other
political communities) attempt to freeze meanings of "the homosexual"
when they enter international games "of powers and pleasures"
(]{.underline}Foucault 1980:48). Ashley argues [it is impossible to
understand the formation of modern sovereign states and international
orders without understanding how a particular version of "sovereign man"
is inscribed as the necessary foundation of a sovereign state and how
this procedure of "statecraft as mancraft" produces a specific ordering
of IR.]{.underline}8 I unpack Ashley's argument by making two moves. I
illustrate Ashley's argument with [reference to "the homosexual" in
Victorian and in Obama administration discourse.]{.underline} I use the
analyses above of Foucault, Haraway, and Butler to argue that Ashley's
"statecraft as mancraft" both furthers understandings of [figurations of
"the homosexual" generally and provides specific IR research questions
for analyzing figurations of "the homosexual" in sexualized orders of
IR.]{.underline} Writing about IR from a poststructuralist perspective,
Ashley's arguments build upon Foucault's analysis of the constitution
and problematization of subjectivities. Yet Ashley adds Jacques
Derrida's deconstructive critique of logocentrism to this analysis,
based upon his reading of Derrida's texts from the 1970s and 1980s (for
example, 1977, 1981). Logocentrism refers to how "the word"---a
singular, specific word signifying a specific presence---grounds all
meaning in a linguistic system because of how it is positioned as a
universal referent that is located outside of history. In the classical
age, "God" was the most common example of a "logos" in a logocentric
system. In the modern age, as Nietzsche argued, "man" displaced "God"
from this logocentric position. Understood as "a pure and originary
presence---an unproblematic, extrahistorical identity, in need of no
critical accounting" (Ashley 1989:261), it [is now "modern man" who
functions in modern discourse as "an origin, an identical voice that is
regarded as the sovereign source of truth and meaning"]{.underline}
(Ashley 1989:261). Derrida argues that by identifying one word, one
being, one presence as an originary "logos" from which all other
meanings flow, [logocentric systems create conditions of possibility for
both hierarchies in linguistic systems and specific narratives of
history.]{.underline} Applying Derrida's ideas to modern renderings of
international politics and international theory (especially to Kenneth
Waltz's neorealist theory), Ashley explains how "the logos" is the
"sovereign source of truth and meaning" in the manifestation and
analysis of the modern nation-state and in specific renderings of
domestic and international orders. Specifically, Ashley argues that [in
IR theory and practice, "modern man" as sovereign man functions not only
as "the logos" of modernity in general but also as the foundation of the
sovereign nation-state.]{.underline} This is because [since the move
from monarchical to popular sovereignty, "modern man" has given the
modern nation-state its sovereign authority]{.underline}. The state's
sovereign authority that had previously been vested in the monarch---as
transcendental, as reasonable, as the interpreter of meaning---is now
vested instead in "modern man." To be sovereign, then, [every sovereign
nation-state inscribes a particular sovereign man as an always already
existing domestic presence as the foundation of its authority
domestically and internationally.]{.underline} What emerges from
Ashley's analysis are three key points that I illustrate with reference
to the Victorian "homosexual" and to Clinton's gay right's holding
"homosexual." First, because the modern sovereign nation-state is
intimately tied to "modern man," the sovereign inscription of the modern
state is intimately tied to the sovereign inscription of "modern man."
To put it in Ashley's terms, "[Modern statecraft is modern mancraft. It
is an art of domesticating the meaning of man by constructing his
problems, his dangers, his fears]{.underline}" (1989:303; italics in
original[). These are projected into the dangerous realm of
international anarchy that sovereign man with his foreign policies
attempts to tame.]{.underline} For example, Victorian [modern man as
"imperial man" required the dangerous, unruly, racially darkened, and
sexualized "savage" as his "colonial (perverse homosexual) subject" to
justify both the reasonableness of Victorian "sovereign man" and his
imperial rule.]{.underline} In contrast, some have argued (Rao 2012)
that [the Obama administration's modern man as "neo-imperial man"
requires the dangerous, unruly, racially darkened, and sexualized
"post-colonial (perverse homosexual) state" to justify both the
reasonableness of an enlightened US "sovereign man" who internationally
proclaims gay rights as human rights to legitimize his neo-imperial
rule.]{.underline} These examples illustrate [why "paradigms of man are
themselves tools of power"]{.underline} (Ashley 1989:300). Second, this
has implications for understanding how IR are ordered. For, as Ashley
argues, "modern mancraft" does not just give rise to the modern
sovereign state; it also gives rise to modern understandings of
international order. For just as the "logos" in Derrida's logocentric
system makes it possible to establish hierarchies, the "logos" of
"modern man" as the "logos" of the modern state organizes IR according
to hierarchies as well. These include [reasonable man/pure danger,
civilized/ barbaric, security/danger, peace/war, domestic/international,
and order/anarchy]{.underline}. In this logocentric system, whatever can
be narrated from the point of view of "the logos" and made to "speak
from a sovereign voice" is what is valued and protected; what cannot be
made to speak from a sovereign voice (for example, anarchy and terror)
must be violently opposed (Ashley 1989:284). [Specifying "modern man" in
"the Malthusian couple" as their civilized, secure, domestic logos,
Victorians narrated the deviant "homosexual" as an intimate, national,
and international source of barbarism, danger, and instability to
"modern man"]{.underline} (Stoler 1995). Expanding hetero/ homonormative
figurations of "the normal couple" to include "the LGBT couple," the
Obama administration [in contrast narrated those unreasonable states
that do not recognize the gay rights of "the LGBT" as sources of
barbarism, danger, and instability to "modern man," established
neocolonial education policies to enlighten unreasonable state's leaders
(for example, by distributing "LGBT" human rights tool kits to foreign
embassies), and imposed sanctions on some states that failed to embrace
gay rights as human rights]{.underline} (Clinton 2011). This is how
"modern man" as sovereign man authorizes the potential use of violence
by the sovereign state on behalf of his presumed transcendental reason
(Ashley 1989:268). Third, Ashley argues that [none of these
figurations---of "modern man," of the modern state, or of international
orders that we in IR understand as variations of order vs. anarchy---are
stable or ahistorical.]{.underline} For the reasonableness of "modern
man" can always be shown to be unreasonable, just as the order of
domestic politics can always be shown to contain aspects of anarchy. To
put it in Derrida's terms, the binaries that order domestic and
international relations constantly deconstruct themselves, making them
both unstable and (because unstable) unreliable. What this means is that
[various invested actors--- from citizens to states to formal
international institutions---constantly attempt to stabilize these
unreliable hierarchies and the figurations that authorize them so they
appear to be ahistorical, given, and true so that they might more
reliably function in domestic and international politics.]{.underline}
The [anxious labor that both the Victorians and the Obama administration
employ(ed) to construct their opposed figurations of "the
homosexual"---often in the face of international resistances by colonial
states]{.underline} (in the case of the Victorians; Stoler 1995) [and by
postcolonial and postcommunist states]{.underline} (in the case of the
Obama administration; Rao 2012; Wilkinson and Langlois 2014)---are cases
in point. This in part explains why i[nternational politics is inscribed
as dangerous by sovereign nation-states (]{.underline}Ashley 1989:304).
For by not ceding to the will of a particular national sovereign man,
international politics (anarchy) always threatens to expose sovereign
man and the sovereign order he guarantees as historical and contingent.
That explains why the [order/anarchy boundary is so highly policed, both
in international practice and in international theory.]{.underline}
Ashley's Derridian analysis, like Foucault's and Haraway's analyses,
suggests contemplating how figurations and the orders (and anarchies)
they produce and that are produced by them are fixed and frozen as well
as unfixed and unfrozen. But because Ashley's analysis is IRfocused, it
additionally provides specific IR research questions that allow analysis
of both how "modern man" is figured as sovereign man on behalf of
sovereign nationstates and how specific figurations of "modern man" as
sovereign man participate in the production of domestic and
international orders. These research questions are: • How does speaking
"the truth" about "homosexuality" and "the homosexual" participate in
the organization and regulation of IR? • What ordering principles of
sexuality generate and sustain---and are generated and sustained by---
figurations of "the homosexual," and how do they function in IR? • How
do figurations of "the homosexual" function as instances of "statecraft
as mancraft," and how specifically is his normality or perversion
figured as "the logos" of or against "sovereign man"? • How do these
ordering principles of sexuality and figurations of "the homosexual" as
or against "sovereign man" work together to order IR? • What do various
practices of statecraft as mancraft make possible in world politics, and
what contingencies are rendered necessary by and through these practices
(Ashley 1989; also see Hopf 2010)?

**Statecraft is not purely gendered but also queered -- it operates
through a plurality of logocentric matrices via which the "modern man"
imposes both homonormative and heteronormative sexualities in service of
imperial sovereignty.**

From Statecraft as Mancraft to Queer Logics of Statecraft The above
research questions go some way toward elaborating Queer IR research
programs informed by a queer intellectual curiosity. Yet I suggest here
that they are limited by Derrida's initial understanding of
deconstruction and its relationship to "the logos" and "the plural." In
the texts Ashley consults, Derrida argues deconstruction is not
something we bring to a text; rather, it is something that is inherent
in a text. This is because meanings in a text (or, in Foucault's broader
terms, a discourse) are always already plural. The logocentric procedure
that tries to impose a singular meaning upon a text or a discourse,
then, is always as political as it is impossible. This explains why
[politics---like the politics of statecraft as mancraft--- endlessly
loops through circuits in which states (or other political communities)
attempt to impose order onto anarchy]{.underline}. By critiquing the
logocentric procedure as it functions in domestic and especially
international politics, Ashley's analysis takes us some way toward
understanding how "paradigms of man are themselves tools of power"
(Ashley 1989:300), not just in specific times and places (as in, for
example, Puar and Rai 2002; Puar 2007; Kuntsman 2009) but more
generally. For Ashley explains how [these impossibly singular normal or
perverse paradigms of sovereign man attempt to figure impossibly
singular normal or perverse international orders in their own
image.]{.underline} This is how actors attempt to impose order onto
anarchy. As powerful as this account is, I suggest it overlooks a
crucial aspect of how [figurations of sovereign man are mobilized to
craft domestic and international orders.]{.underline} What is missing is
an account of how [not just a singular logos but a plural logoi
potentially figures sovereign man and orders international politics in
ways that construct and deconstruct these figures and
orders.]{.underline} Why this matters in [Queer IR contexts is because
this plural logoi can be understood as simultaneously normal and/or
perverse as it is enacted through sexes, genders, and sexualities as
well as through various registers of authority]{.underline} (something I
will explain further with reference to Neuwirth/Wurst). [A plural
logoi---especially a normal and/or perverse logoi---appears, on the face
of it, to be counterintuitive.]{.underline} This is especially the case
because of how Derrida initially sets up "the logos" as the necessarily
singular (and presumptively normal) "word" that he opposes to the
necessarily plural (and possibly perverse) "text."9 Following Derrida,
Ashley analyzes accounts of sovereign man as the necessarily singular
(and presumptively normal) "sovereign orderer" who is opposed to the
necessarily plural (and presumptively perverse) "anarchy." While Ashley
insists on the plurality of man (1989:308), he does not consider how
this [plural man might function as a sovereign man who might be
necessarily plural.]{.underline}10 As a result, Ashley neglects to
consider how [the plural might be empowered not just because it is
foundationally normal(ized) but because it is also foundationally
perverse (perverted).]{.underline} Ashley's analysis therefore misses
opportunities to investigate how the normal and/or perverse plural might
function as a possible or even necessary foundation of meaning in a
logocentric system, rather than always in opposition to the singular
(presumptively normal) logos. [What might a plural logoi look like, and
what might its implications be for understandings of statecraft as
mancraft?]{.underline} My notion of a plural logoi comes from Roland
Barthes' (1974, 1976) [description of the rule of the and/ or. To
explain what the and/or is and how it functions, I use illustrations of
sex, gender, and sexuality first to contrast the and/or with the more
traditional "either/or" and]{.underline} second to pluralize the rule of
the and/or itself. The "either/or" operates according to a binary logic,
forcing a choice of either one term or another term to comprehend the
true meaning of a text, a discipline, a person, an act. For example, in
the binary terms of the "either/ or," a person is either a boy or a
girl. In contrast, [the and/or exceeds this binary logic because it
appreciates how the meaning of something or someone cannot necessarily
be contained within an "either/or" choice.]{.underline} This is because
sometimes (maybe even always) understanding someone or something is not
as simple as fixing on a singular meaning---either one meaning or
another. Instead, [understanding can require us to appreciate how a
person or a thing is constituted by and simultaneously embodies
multiple, seemingly contradictory meanings that may confuse and confound
a simple either/or dichotomy.]{.underline} It is this [plurality that
the and/or expresses.]{.underline} According to the logic of the
"and/or," a [subject is both one thing and another (plural, perverse)
while simultaneously one thing or another (singular,
normal]{.underline}). For example, a person might be both a boy and a
girl while simultaneously being either a boy or a girl. This might be
because a person is read as either a boy or a girl while also being read
as in between sexes (intersexed), in between sexes and genders (a
castrato), or combining sexes, genders, and sexualities in ways that do
not correspond to one side of the boy/girl dichotomy or the other (a
person who identifies as a "girl" in terms of their sex, as a "boy" in
terms of their gender, and as a "girlboy" or "boygirl" in terms of their
sexuality). In these examples, a person can be and while simultaneously
being or because the terms "boy" and "girl" are not reducible to
traditional dichotomous codes of sex, gender, or sexuality either
individually or in combination, even though traditional "either/or"
readings attempt to make them so. While Barthes' rule of the and/or is
derived from his description of the castrato's body that he reads as
combining two sexes and two genders (1974), the plural that constitutes
a subjectivity can also be more than one thing and/or another. For a
subjectivity can be one thing and another and another, etc. as well as
one thing or another or another, etc. in relation to sexes, genders, and
sexualities, as there are multiple sexes, genders, and sexualities
individually and in combination (Fausto-Sterling 1993). This suggests
both the limitations of deploying Barthesian plural logics as if they
expressed a singular rule of the and/or and the expansive possibilities
of plural logics that pluralize the rule of the and/or itself. This
discussion makes two significant points. First, the singular choice we
are forced to make by an "either/or" logic (for example, boy or girl)
excludes the plural logics of the and/or. [Plural logics of the and/or
contest binary logics, understanding the presumed singularity and
coherence of its available choices (]{.underline}either "boys" or
"girls," either normal or perverse[), their resulting subjectivities
(only "boys" and "girls"), and their presumed ordering principles
(either hetero/homonormative or disruptively/ disorderingly queer) as
the social, cultural, and political effects of attempts to constitute
them as if they were singular, coherent, and whole]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is only by appreciating how the (pluralized) and/or
constitutes dichotomy-defying subjectivities that we can grasp their
meanings. Second, when the (pluralized) and/or supplements the
"either/or," meanings are mapped differently. For in the (pluralized)
and/or, meanings are no longer (exclusively) regulated by the slash that
divides the "either/or." Instead, meanings are (also) irregulated by
this slash and by additional slashes that connect terms in multiple ways
that defy "either/or" interpretations. Importantly, Barthes does not
argue that "either/or" logics are unimportant. He suggests it is both
the "either/ or" and the (pluralized) and/or that constitute meanings.
Yet he stresses texts should not be reduced to an "either/ or" logic, so
we can "appreciate what plural constitutes" a text, a character, a plot,
an order (Barthes 1974:5; emphasis in original). "\[R\][eleasing the
double \[multiple\] meaning on principle," the logic of the (pluralized)
and/or "corrupts the purity of communications; it is a deliberate
'static', painstakingly elaborated, introduced into the fictive dialogue
between author and reader, in short, a
countercommunication"]{.underline} (1974:9; my brackets). The
(pluralized) and/or, then, is a plural logic that the "either/or" can
neither comprehend nor contain. It is how the (pluralized) and/[or
introduces a kind of systematic, non-decidable plurality into discourse
as "that which confuses meaning, the norm, normativity \[and, I would
add, antinormativities\]" (]{.underline}Barthes 1976:109, my brackets;
on antinormativities see Wiegman and Wilson 2015:1--3) [around the
normality and/or perversion of sexes, genders, and sexualities rather
than just accumulating differences]{.underline} (as intersectionality
suggests; Crewshaw 1991) that [makes it a queer logic]{.underline}
(Weber 1999:xiii; also see Weber 2014). For a (pluralized) Barthesian
and/or accords with Sedgwick's definition of queer as "the \... excesses
of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's
sexuality aren't made (or can't be made) to signify monolithically"
(1993:8) as exclusively "and" or as exclusively "or." [Identifying these
often illusive figurations, the now queer Barthesian and/or suggests how
we should investigate queer figures]{.underline}. Barthes' instruction
is this---read (queer) figures not only through the "either/or" but also
through the (pluralized) and/or. While Barthes offered this instruction
in the context of reading literature (1974), [his queer rule of the
(pluralized) and/or applies equally to foreign policy texts and
contexts. For "sovereign man" as a plural logoi in a logocentric
procedure can figure foreign policy and (dis)-order international
politics.1]{.underline}1 For example, consider the case of the 2014
Eurovision Song Contest winner Tom Neuwirth and/as Conchita Wurst. At
least since winning the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest and announcing in
her/his/their acceptance speech, "We are unity, and we are unstoppable,"
Neuwirth/Wurst has been taken up by some Europeans as [a figuration who
embodies either a positive or a negative image of an integrated
Europe]{.underline}. This places Neuwirth/Wurst in an "[either/ or"
logic of statecraft as mancraft (Ashley 1989), in which the crafting of
a singular "sovereign man" for the European Community functions through
a traditional understanding of sovereignty as "a complex practice of
authorization, a practice through which specific agencies are enabled to
draw a line" between who can legitimately be included and excluded from
the political community this "European sovereign man" grounds
(]{.underline}Walker 2000:22). [In this traditional "either/or" logic of
statecraft as mancraft, what is debated is whether or not Neuwirth/Wurst
as a proposed "sovereign man" of the new Europe is/should be licensed to
draw a line between properly integrated and normalized Europeans and
improperly integrated and perverse Europeans]{.underline} in a Europe
that has been striving for integration in one form or another since the
end of World War II. This is in part why Neuwirth/Wurst's Euro-vision of
Europe engendered such strong expressions of disgust or approval. For
example, far right Bulgarian MEP candidate Angel Dzhambazki remarked
that, "This bearded creature, called with the European name Conchita
Wurst is like genetically modified organism and won the Eurovision. And
I wonder, if the vice of our time is that we tolerate the perversity. I
don't want such a song contest for my children" (Kosharevsk 2014:np). In
contrast, the UN spokesperson for Ban Ki-Moon commented: Everyone is
entitled to enjoy the same basic rights and live a life of worth and
dignity without discrimination. This fundamental principle is embedded
in the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Conchita is a symbol in that sense and I think it's good for them to
meet. \[The meeting allows us\] to reassert his \[Ban Ki-Moon's\]
support for LGBT people and for them to ensure that they enjoy the same
human rights and protection that we all do (Duffy 2014:np; my brackets).
[Understanding Neuwirth/Wurst as either normal or perverse required
Europeans to read Neuwirth/Wurst as a figure who is knowable and
placable along an "either/or" axis---in relation to Europe and in
relation to traditional European debates about European integration. And
yet,]{.underline} while Neuwirth/Wurst certainly seems to be making a
call for some kind of unity from a platform that has traditionally
promoted European integration, Neuwirth/Wurst does so as [a figure who
defies traditional understandings of integration across multiple axes.
These include (but are not necessarily confined to) sex, gender,
sexuality, nationality, race, civilization, and authority.]{.underline}
For example, Neuwirth/Wurst's and/or sexes, genders, and sexualities are
evident in how this bearded drag queen is read through vast matrices of
sexes, genders, and sexualities that minimally include either male or
female, masculine or feminine, heterosexual or homosexual, normal or
perverse as well as simultaneously male and female, masculine and
feminine, heterosexual and homosexual, normal and perverse. This figures
Neuwirth/Wurst as queer, because he/she/they do not signify
monolithically around sexes, genders, or sexualities. Neuwirth/Wurst,
then, is a performative embodiment of a plural logoi that functions as a
deliberate static which confounds and confuses traditional
understandings of sexes, genders, and sexualities (Barthes 1974, 1976).
Neuwirth "himself," however, seems to signify (more) monolithically
around sex, gender, and sexuality, identifying as a male "homosexual"
who eschews descriptions of himself as trans\* (Davies 2014).12 This and
his statements in support of gay marriage, for example, make him
compatible with "the LGBT" Clinton (2011) describes, whose
"homosexuality" can be classified, domesticated, and homonormative. At
the same time, Neuwirth/Wurst embodies a pluralized and/or logic in
international politics in the registers of nationality, race,
civilization, and authority that confound a simple understanding of
Neuwirth/Wurst in "either/or" terms. This is evident in the various
official biographies of Neuwirth and/as Wurst that appeared since
Neuwirth/Wurst's selection as Austria's representative to Eurovision
2014.13 These bios state Neuwirth was born and raised in Austria, while
Wurst was born "in the mountains of Colombia" to a Colombian mother and
German father and "raised in Germany." They position Neuwirth as a
"natural" European citizen and Wurst as a diasporic Colombian and/or
German subject who has relocated from the global South to the global
North. This has implications for how Neuwirth/Wurst is read nationally,
racially, civilizationally, and as a "sovereign authority." Nationally,
Neuwirth/Wurst is Austrian (like Tom) and/or Colombian (like Conchita's
mother) and/or German (like Conchita's father). Racially, Neuwirth/
Wurst is white (presumptively like Tom and like Conchita's father,
because neither are marked as nonwhite) and/or mestiza (because
Conchita's Colombian mother who is from rural Colombia is likely to be
indigenous or mestiza). Civilizationally, Neuwirth/Wurst is European
(like Tom and like Conchita's father) and/or indigenous and/or Hispanic
(like Conchita's mother). All of this puts Neuwirth/Wurst's ability to
function as a singular "sovereign man" for a new Europe in doubt---
whether that Europe is normal or perverse. This is because
Neuwirth/Wurst pluralizes by crossing and combining so many of "fortress
Europe's" boundaries territorially, racially, and civilizationally
because of how Neuwirth/Wurst crafts his/her/their sexes, genders, and
sexualities through "the two hearts beating in \[the one\] chest"14 of
Tom Neuwirth and/as Conchita Wurst. At the same time, [Neuwirth/Wurst's
plurality---not just singularity---in all these sexualized international
registers make this figure repulsive and/or attractive to
statesleaders]{.underline}. This figures Neuwirth/Wurst as both [a
plurally anarchical force---a potentially unruly threat to bring "the
violence of the world we live in at the heart of the home, at the heart
of the national \[and regional\] self" (]{.underline}Fortier 2008:60; my
brackets) [and as a singular "sovereign man" upon whom a normal or
perverse European order might be founded and as a plural "sovereign man"
upon whom a normal and/or perverse European order might be
founded.]{.underline} This is because Neuwirth/Wurst is both one thing
or another (normal or perverse) while simultaneously being one thing and
another (normal and perverse), with respect to European integration and
with respect to integration more broadly. This makes Neuwirth/Wurst a
potentially singular "sovereign man" in a traditional logic of
statecraft as mancraft and a [potentially plural and/or foundation of
what I call queer logics of statecraft, whose call for unity from a
European integration platform is far more complex than it might at first
appear to be]{.underline} (Weber 2016). This regional illustration of
statecraft as mancraft suggests that statecraft as mancraft is less
straightforward than Ashley suggests. [Because the logos/logoi of the
logocentric procedure can be plural as well as singular by being normal
and/or perverse around sexes, genders, and sexualities and around
numerous important registers of international politics, sometimes
statecraft as mancraft is (also) a queer activity that results in
unusual sexualized orders of international politics.]{.underline} We
cannot account for these queer instances of statecraft simply by adding
the singular "homosexual"---as either sovereign man or his foil---to our
analyses. [Rather, tracing how plural logics of the and/or function in
global politics---as queer logics of statecraft---is to appreciate how
the normal and/or perverse plural sometimes scripts sovereign figures
and/as their adversaries as well as the unusual orders these mixed
figures produce and are productive of. Queer logics of statecraft are
evident in those moments in domestic and international relations when
actors or orders rely upon a queerly conceptualized Barthesian and/
or---an and that is at the same time an or in relation to sexes,
genders, and sexualities---to perfomatively figure sovereign man, the
sovereign state or another political community, or some combined version
of the order/anarchy and normal/perverse binaries as normal and/or
perverse. Analyzing IR through a lens of queer logics of statecraft
directs us,]{.underline} following and then extending Ashley's
arguments, [to categories that connect and/or break apart foundational
binaries like order/anarchy and normal/perverse, by understanding the
stabilizing "slash(es)" in these binaries as multiplying and
complicating connections, figures, orders, and anarchies rather than
reducing and simplifying them.]{.underline} It leads us to ask how "the
plural" as "a deliberate static" (Barthes 1976:5, 9) is introduced into
these binaries to both establish and confound their meanings and the
meanings of "men," "states," "orders," and "anarchies" as well as the
meanings of "sexes," "genders," and "sexualities" which are foundational
to them. In a Butlerian vein, [queer logics of statecraft require us to
take seriously how the plural is performatively enacted, enabling a
plethora of national and international figurations and logics that can
be (queerly) inhabited.]{.underline} Following Sedgwick, queer logics of
statecraft are attentive to how sexes, genders, and sexualities that
fail or refuse to signify monolithically are productive of and are
produced by unexpectedly normal and/ or perverse "sovereign men,"
"sovereign communities," and sovereignly ordained orders and anarchies.
Queer logics of statecraft, then, do not just describe those moments
when the performatively perverse creates the appearance of the
performatively normal. Nor do they describe only the opposite, when the
performatively normal creates the appearance of the performatively
perverse, although those can be among their effects. Rather, [queer
logics of statecraft describe those moments in domestic and
international politics when the logos/logoi as a subjectivity or the
logos/logoi as a logic is plurally normal and/or perverse in ways that
"confound the norm, normativity]{.underline} \[and anti-normativity\]
(my brackets; Barthes 1976:109; Wiegman and Wilson, 2015:1-3) of
individually or collectively singularly inscribed notions of sovereign
man, sovereign communities, or sexualized orders of IR. This is not to
say that queer logics of statecraft do not give rise to "institutions,
structures of understanding, and practical orientations" (Berlant and
Warner 1995:548, footnote 2) that make "sovereign men," "sovereign
states," and international orders appear to be singular, coherent, and
privileged. In this respect, they can be [akin to sexual organizing
principles like heteronormativies and homonormativities]{.underline}
(Berlant and Warner 1998:548; footnote 2; Duggan 2003:50). For, by
"confusing the \[singular\] norm, normativity \[or antinormativity\]"
(my brackets; Barthes 1976:109; Wiegman and Wilson, 2015:1-3), [queer
logics of statecraft can produce new institutions, new structures of
understanding, and new practical orientations that are paradoxically
founded upon a disorienting and/or reorienting plural. This can make
them more alluring, more powerful, and more easily
mobilized]{.underline} by both those who, for example, wish to resist
hegemonic relations of power and those who wish to sustain them (Weber
1999, 2002; Puar and Rai 2002; Puar 2007). Unlike heteronormativities
and homonormativities, though, [we cannot name in advance what these
institutions, structures of understanding, and practical (dis)/
(re)orientations will be. We cannot know whether they will be
politicizing or depoliticizing]{.underline}. To determine this, it is
necessary to identify both the precise plural(s) each particular queer
logic of statecraft employs to figure some particular "sovereign man,"
"sovereign state," or other "sovereign community" and international
order, always asking, "[For what constituency or constituencies does
this plural operate?"]{.underline} The case of Neuwirth/Wurst is
striking, then, because it illustrates how Europeans leaders
debated---albeit very briefly---a plural logoi as a possible ground for
contemporary Europe, whether they recognized Neuwirth/Wurst as a plural
logoi or not. In discussions about the "new Europe," both sides in this
debate employed Neuwirth/ Wurst to construct and authorize their
Euro-visioned hierarchies of order vs. anarchy, as if they were true. In
this way, [Neuwirth/Wurst generated not only competing sexualized orders
of contemporary Eu]{.underline}rope; he/she/they also practically
[(dis)/(re)oriented and (de)/(re)railed any idealized contemporary
European-wide vision of an already united Europe.]{.underline} It is not
surprising that in their mobilizations of Neuwirth/Wurst, [European
leaders attempted to claim him/her/them as either normal or perverse,
for this is how traditional logics of statecraft as mancraft
operate.]{.underline} Because European leaders failed to consider
Neuwirth/ Wurst through the lens of queer logics of statecraft, they
generally failed to appreciate what plural(s) constituted him/her/them
and how the plural and/or logic he/she/ they embodies is what made their
attempts to claim or disown---to normalize or to pervert---this normal
and/or perverse figure both possible and impossible. Yet it is this very
failure on the part of European leaders to read Neuwirth/Wurst through
the plural(s) that constitute(s) him/her/them that suggests an
additional set of research questions for international theory and
practice, including: • Can a paradigm of sovereign man be effective
without being---as Ashley claims the ideal type of sovereign man must
be---"regarded as originary, unproblematic, given for all time, and,
hence, beyond criticism and independent of politics" (Ashley 1989:271)?
• What happens when a political community like a state or the European
Union considers grounding itself upon a pluralized and/or logoi? • Under
what conditions might this be desirable or even necessary, and what
might it make possible or preclude? • How might queer logics of
statecraft effect the organization, regulation, and conduct of
international politics?

**Queer modalities of international political theorization are
marginalized by the disciplinary force of their model that pathologizes
queer analytics as unproductive and ahistorical thus effacing its
value.**

Since its formation as an academic field, Queer Studies has questioned
'the uniformity of sexual identities,' tracing how sexual and gender
variance undo fixed identity categories like gay, lesbian, and straight.
This led to theorizations of sexuality and gender as flexible, often
anti-normative, and increasingly politicized (Duggan, 2003). Most of
this work involved thinking sex, sexuality, and their performances on a
personal, institutional, or national scale (Berlant and Freeman, 1992;
Butler, 1990; Rubin, 1984). In [response to contemporary global
incidents ranging from 'the triumph of neoliberalism' to the 'infinite
"war on terrorism"' to 'the pathologizing of immigrant communities as
"terrorists"']{.underline} (Eng et al., 2005: 1[), Queer Studies
has]{.underline} largely transformed itself into Global Queer Studies
(GQS). In this guise, it [produces significant insights on the global
workings of 'race, on the problems of transnationalism, on conflicts
between global capital and labor, on issues of diaspora and immigration,
and on questions of citizenship, national belonging, and
necropolitics']{.underline} (Eng et al., 2005: 2; also see Povinelli and
Chauncey, 1999). GQS contributions to what are arguably the three core
areas of International Relations (IR) research --- war and peace, state
and nation formation, and international political economy --- are
regularly featured in top-ranked journals and in top-ranked book series
(e.g. Binnie, 2004; Briggs, 2003; Cruz-Malave and Manalansan, 2002; Eng
et al., 2005; Hoad, 2000; Khanna, 2007; Kuntsman, 2009; Luibhied, 2002,
2007; Luibhied and Cantu, 2005; Puar, 2007; Puar and Rai, 2002;
Schulman, 2012a; Spurlin, 2013). But not in the field of IR. Strikingly,
[this resurgence of activity in and attention to GQS and to the
scholarship it is producing has largely bypassed IR.]{.underline} Since
Queer Studies made the turn to Global Queer Studies over the last
decade, only six journal articles and no special issues on GQS themes
have been published in the top 20 impact-rated IR journals, and only one
GQSthemed book has been published or commissioned by a top IR book
series.1 All of this begs the question: if Queer Studies has enhanced
understandings of international politics by going global, why has IR not
gone somewhat queer? Or, to paraphrase Martin Wight, why is there no
Queer International Theory? Three likely answers spring to mind. Answer
1: 'IR scholars are not interested in queer-themed work.' This may be
the case for many, yet it does not account for the fact that membership
in the International Studies Association (ISA) LGBTQA Caucus, which
(among other things) sponsors ISA panels, is steadily growing. Nor does
it explain why the first interdisciplinary conference to focus on Queer
IR2 received over 100 submissions and drew 200 participants.3 Answer 2:
'This interest in GQS has not (yet) led IR scholars to produce any Queer
International Theory.' This answer ignores an expanding body of
queer-themed work authored by IR scholars that dates back some 20 years
(e.g. Agathangelou, 2013; Altman, 2006; Jauhola, 2010; Kollman, 2007;
Owens, 2010; Peterson, 1999, 2013; Pratt, 2007; Rao, 2010; Sabsay, 2013;
Shepherd and Sjoberg, 2012; Sjoberg, 2012; Smith, 2003; Weber, 1994a,
1994b, 1998b, 1998c, 1999, 2002, forthcoming). Yet, because most of this
work is not published in IR outlets, this does contribute to the
impression that there is no Queer International Theory. Answer 3: 'All
of the GQS-themed work produced by IR scholars is so interdisciplinary
that it lacks a primary focus on core IR concerns, which is why IR
scholars are not interested in it and why it is not published in IR
outlets.' Yet, [the primary foci of most queer-themed work published by
IR scholars are classic IR themes such as war, security, sovereignty,
intervention, hegemony, nationalism, empire, colonialism, and the
general practice of foreign policy. Of particular relevance to IR
scholars are investigations that explore how failing hegemonic states
perform queerness through their conduct of interventions and wars to
solidify their hegemonic status (Weber, 1999), how states produce
themselves and their citizens as pro-LGBT subjects in part to constitute
other states, 'civilizations,' or peoples as national and global threats
(Puar, 2007), how the articulation Weber 29 and circulation of global
(economic) value through queer and racialized bodies supports the
practices of empires (Agathangelou, 2013; Scott, 2013), and, more
generally, how 'queer' is mobilized to designate some state practices as
progressive and others as nonprogressive as a mechanism to divide the
world into orderly versus disorderly (anarchic) spaces]{.underline}
(Agathangelou, 2013; Haritaworn et al., 2013; Puar, 2003; Rao,
forthcoming; Remkus, forthcoming). This suggests that multiple queer
international theories do exist, which means we need to ask a different
question: why does there appear to be no Queer International Theory? My
claim is that [the presumed non-existence of Queer International Theory
c]{.underline}annot be explained merely by its absence from prestigious
IR journals and book series because this absence [is the (un)conscious
effect of how so-called Disciplinary IR codes various types of theory as
failures. 'Disciplinary IR' --- which aspires to be but is not
equivalent to the discipline of IR as a whole --- is, of course, as
imagined as it is enacted, and it changes as social, cultural, economic,
and political forces change]{.underline}. Yet, at any particular
historical moment, IR scholars have a working knowledge of Disciplinary
IR because it [embodies the general commitments and standards that
regulate, manage, and normalize 'the conduct of conduct']{.underline}
(Foucault, 1994: 237) regarding IR publishing, funding, hiring,
promotion, and tenure decisions. While there are certainly institutional
and national variations in how these standards are enacted (Hoffmann,
1977; Waever, 1998), [most IR academics are required to justify their
work with regard to these standards at some point in their careers.
Disciplinary IR's commitments and standards are as much the performative
result of so-called 'mainstream' agendas of]{.underline} learned
societies, universities, independent funding agencies, and governments
that support [socially, culturally, economically, or politically
'policy-relevant,' 'useful,' or 'impactful' research as they are the
performative outcome of so-called 'dissident' practices]{.underline}
(Ashley and Walker, 1990; also see Soreanu, 2010) [that seek to rewrite,
resist, or rebel against so-called mainstream agendas, be they
'scientific,' 'positivist,' or 'neoliberal,' for example]{.underline}.
Together, these intricately intertwined positions produce a Disciplinary
IR that claims to speak for the whole of the discipline of IR because it
wields sufficient power to (de)legitimate IR scholars and their work for
many user communities. Because of its power, [Disciplinary IR is as
often contested as it is assimilated to by IR scholars of virtually all
intellectual dispositions]{.underline}.4 A central tenet of what I am
calling Disciplinary IR is embedded in the work of Martin Wight. Wight
claimed that for international theorizing to succeed, it [must
accumulate knowledge about interstate relations]{.underline} (Smith,
2000; Wight, 1966). My claim is that from a Disciplinary IR perspective,
theories --- including [queer international theories --- fail because
they are judged not to be making progress toward this]{.underline} goal.
This is what explains the subsequent absence of queer international
theories from prestigious IR journals and book series and the presumed
non-existence of Queer International Theory. To substantiate this claim,
I [investigate how Disciplinary IR employs three strategies ---
homologization, figuration, and gentrification --- to make it appear as
if there is no Queer International Theory]{.underline}. Homologization
describes the act of [using a homology to describe relationships,
relative positions, and structures in a set of elements in order to
prescribe how relationships ought to be ordered and how elements and
their aims ought]{.underline} to be valued (e.g. Wight, 1966).5
[Figuration describes the act of employing semiotic tropes that combine
knowledges, practices, and power to shape how we map our worlds and
understand actual things in those worlds]{.underline} (Haraway, 1997).
[Gentrification describes the replacement of mix with homogeneity while
pretending difference and privilege do not exist (Schulman,
2012b).]{.underline} My analysis is grounded in Martin Wight's famous
homology: 'Politics is to International Politics as Political Theory is
to Historical Interpretation' (Wight, 1966). This is not only because
Wight's homology illustrates and/or authorizes homologization,
figuration, and gentrification. It is also because Wight's homology
elegantly encapsulates how Disciplinary IR has traditionally thought of
itself since its formation in the wake of the First World War --- as
separate but parallel to the discipline of politics and as capable of
achieving its aim to produce unique cumulative knowledge about
international politics only if it models itself on how political theory
is practiced. In the 1960s, Wight mobilized this generalized view to
make his case for a historical approach to the study of IR --- both as a
participant in the first 'great debate' over method and methodology
between traditionalists and behavioralists and as a historian who
founded an International Relations department. This in part accounts for
Wight's contentious claim that international theory can only succeed if
it transforms itself into historical interpretation and his contentious
placement of the term 'Historical Interpretation' in the place one would
expect to find the term 'International Theory' in his homology. IR
debates about methodology and history have certainly moved on since
Wight's time (e.g. Lapid, 1989; Rosenberg, 2006). Even so, the values
and relationships expressed in Wight's homology are still widely
accepted in Disciplinary IR, to the point that Wight's homology remains
a generalizable guide to regulating how international theorizing ought
to be conducted. Beginning with Martin Wight's homology, I trace how
Wight's [strategy of homologization equates international theory and the
discipline of International Relations with failure, authorizes the
figuration of specific types of international theory and specific ways
of producing international theory as failures, and embraces a gentrified
strategy of substitution as a legitimate response to these
failure]{.underline}s. Applying these logics to queer international
theories, I suggest [that homologization, figuration, and gentrification
combine to make it appear as if there is no Queer International Theory.
In so doing, they authorize the discipline of IR (on Disciplinary IR's
behalf) to dismiss queer international theories as International Theory,
resulting in negative consequences not only for the scholars who produce
this type of work, but for the discipline of IR as a whole.]{.underline}
I conclude by reflecting on the costs of using Wight's homology to
regulate, manage, and normalize the scholarly conduct of international
theorizing --- for queer international theories and for the discipline
of IR as a whole. I argue that while most scholars in the discipline
(un)consciously embrace Wight's homology as their guide to disciplinary
success, my analysis of Queer International Theory reveals that Wight's
homology has three detrimental effects on the discipline: it limits how
international politics is enriched by critical inquiry, it cedes
consideration of key international phenomena to other disciplines, and
it paradoxically leads to disciplinary failure on the discipline's own
terms. Because the case of Queer International Theory illustrates how
Disciplinary IR manages not just queer international theories, but all
theories that profess to be International Theory, generalizable lessons
can be drawn from this case for the discipline as a whole. Primary among
these is that IR's disciplinary attachment to Wight's homology
compromises possibilities for doing international theorizing and
thinking international politics not only on terms the discipline
rejects, but on terms the discipline embraces.

**The idea of "objective" IR that represents an accumulation of
historical fact pushes out queer scholarship -- queer political theory
and practice is based in the construction of subjective and embodied
epistemologies that form multiplicities of "truths."**

International Theory?,\" University of Sussex, SAGE Journals,

Even those scholars who do not overtly employ Wight's homology often
unconsciously abide by its recommendations. If they do not, they risk
not being recognized as proper international relations theorists. In
this way, then, [Wight's homology normalizes the conduct of
international theorizing rather broadly in the discipline of IR because
it governs how a critical mass of IR scholars (un)consciously think
about international theories in general and about their own practices as
international theorists specifically.]{.underline} This is what makes
Wight's homology so dangerous and so powerful. It is dangerous because
it [is a highly biased expression of what politics, theory, and
knowledge ought to look like in Disciplinary IR's view of the discipline
of IR, which is applied to the discipline as if it were objective.
It]{.underline} is powerful because it [functions as a technology of
differentiation to designate failure and pathways to success for
international theories that can be applied to normalize (by validating,
dismissing, or correcting) any type of theory and theorist that/who
would dare to make a claim to be (doing) International
Theory.]{.underline} This is why Wight's homologization of international
theories matters for queer international theories. For when Wight's
observations about International Theory are applied to Queer
International Theory, queer international theories are homologized out
of existence. Like International Theory, [Queer International Theory
'does not, at first sight, exist']{.underline} (Wight, 1966: 17)
[because it fails to measure up to its 'twin,' Queer Political Theory,
in content and in function.]{.underline} This is for three reasons.
First, [queer international theories lack a substantial, significant
body of classical texts]{.underline} (Wight, 1966: 17) that Queer
Political Theory provides (from Foucault (1979 \[1976\]), to Butler
(1990) to De Lauretis (1991) to Sedgwick (1991) for example), [offering
in its place scattered, unsystematic texts published almost exclusively
in non-IR outlets.]{.underline} Second, while [queer international
theories contribute to scholarly discussions about war, security,
terrorism]{.underline} (Owens, 2010; Weber, 2002), [states,
nationalism]{.underline} (Peterson, 1999, 2013; Weber, 1998b[),
sovereignty, intervention, hegemony]{.underline} (Pratt, 2007; Weber,
1994a, 1994b, 1999), [empire]{.underline} (Agathangelou, 2013) and other
international forms of violence, [they do not restrict themselves to
focusing on 'high politics' or 'the states-system, the diplomatic
community itself']{.underline} (Wight, 1966: 22). Instead, they often
twin the content of Queer Political Theory by [using an array of
interdisciplinary high and low theories, epistemologies, and
methods]{.underline} (see Sedgwick, 1991) that [defy Wight's tidy
boundaries]{.underline} between Politics and International Politics,
between Political Theory and International Theory, and [between
successful and unsuccessful knowledge accumulation to describe Queer
International Politics 'as they really are.']{.underline} This is widely
seen as acceptable practice in queer political theorizing in general
because [queer political practices are themselves so mixed that they can
only accurately be described with a mix of theories, epistemologies,
methodologies, and foci. But]{.underline} it is infrequently viewed as
acceptable practice in Disciplinary IR theorizing. This is because
[Disciplinary IR rarely recognizes boundary-breaking theoretical,
epistemological, and methodological approaches to international
theorizing as being productive of valuable knowledge about international
politics]{.underline} (Weber, 2013).7 What this means in Wight's terms,
then, is that queer international theories [stray too far from telling
the one true story that all International Theory must tell --- the story
about the survival of states in the states-system.]{.underline} And they
stray too far from deploying acceptable approaches in telling the
stories they do tell about international politics --- approaches that
use positivist methods to accumulate knowledge. Finally, [because much
of the 'low,' boundary-breaking content of queer international political
processes is classified out of existence]{.underline} by Wight, Wight's
[homology places queer international theories at a fork in the road
where both paths lead to failure.]{.underline} If queer international
theories explore a mix of high and low, domestic and international queer
international political processes using appropriate epistemologies and
methodologies, they are faulted by Wight's homology for twinning the
content but not the function of its twin, Queer Political Theory. Yet,
[if they neglect to explore this mix of queer international political
processes, they are faulted for not reflecting international political
processes 'as they really are.']{.underline} What this means is that
while it might be possible to claim that Queer Politics equals Queer
Political Theory, Wight's homology offers no successful route to a claim
that Queer International Politics equals Queer International Theory.
This is how queer international theories are homologized as failures.
Because [queer international theories are (un)consciously homologized as
failing the discipline of IR, Queer International Theory
is,]{.underline} following Wight's contestable logic, [deemed to be
non-existent]{.underline}. And Disciplinary IR's next logical step is to
again follow in Wight's footsteps, by substituting a 'successful' type
of International Theory in its place. Wight's homologization of theory,
then, [first authorizes the figuring of various types of theory as
failures and then authorizes their substitution with successful
theory]{.underline}. Explaining how these processes work in relation to
queer international theories is the task of the next two sections.

**Queer engagement with international relations is coded as an already
failed project -- a political road not taken that exists in a space of
perpetual elimination at the hands of modern IR's calculative
normativity -- vote affirmative to unsettle the construction of IR as we
know it.**

Figuring failure [Failure is the map of political paths not taken,
though it does not chart a completely separate land; failure's by-ways
are all the spaces in between the superhighways of capital.]{.underline}
(Halberstam, 2011: 19) My argument so far has focused on how Martin
Wight's famous essay renders international theories --- and particularly
queer international theories --- non-existent by homologizing them as
failures. In this section, I extend this discussion to the figuration of
failure by pursuing two aims. The first is to examine how Wight's
[homologization of international theories]{.underline} (including queer
international theories) illustrates and [authorizes the figuration of
failure.]{.underline} I do this by applying a simplified version of
Donna Haraway's theorization of figuration to Wight's homology.8 The
second is to analyze how Wight's [homology thwarts attempts to celebrate
queer international theories as what Judith Jack Halberstam calls
'successful failure,' a concept that has recently gained traction
amongst some Queer IR scholars]{.underline}. To do this, I read Wight's
figuration of theoretical failure in tandem with Halberstam's work on
queer (as) failure. Haraway describes [figuration as the act of
employing semiotic tropes that combine knowledges, practices, and power
to shape how we map our worlds and understand actual things in those
worlds]{.underline} (1997). Haraway argues that [figurations take
specific form through their reliance on tropes, temporalities,
performances, and worldings]{.underline} (1997: 11). Tropes are material
and semiotic references to actual things that express how we understand
actual things. Tropes are not 'literal or self-identical' to the things
they describe (Haraway, 1997: 11). Rather, tropes are figures of speech.
Haraway argues that '\[a\]ll language, including mathematics, is
figurative, that is, made of tropes, constituted by bumps that make us
swerve from literal-mindedness' (1997: 11). This is because all language
--- textual, visual, artistic --- involves 'at least some kind of
displacement that can trouble identifications and certainties' (1997:
11) between a figure and an actual thing. Wight's homology is a
figuration that deploys a mathematical trope. Describing his homology as
an equation (1960: 22; 1966: 32), [Wight invites a mathematical
engagement with his homology, one that makes us 'swerve from
literal-mindedness']{.underline} (Haraway, 36 European Journal of
International Relations 21(1) 1997: 11), [away from the fact that (in
this case) queer international theories exist to make us consider their
non-existence]{.underline}. It does this [by figuring relationships
among actual bodies of theory and how we ought to understand
them.]{.underline} Wight's homology is also figurative because it is
temporal, performative, and worlding. Haraway notes that [figurations
are historically rooted in 'the semiotics of Western Christian realism,'
which is embedded with a progressive, eschatological
temporality.]{.underline} Western Christian figures embody this
progressive temporality because they hold the promise of salvation in
the afterlife (1997: 9). This medieval notion of developmental
temporality remains a vital aspect of contemporary figurations, even
when figures take secular forms (e.g. when science promises to deliver
us from evil with a new technological innovation; see Haraway, 1997:
10). Developmental progress as the route to secular salvation is equally
present in Wight's homology. With the achievements of Queer Political
Theory as its developmental goal, would-be Queer International Theory is
advised by Wight to journey down the same path as its righteous twin by
replicating Queer Political Theory's project of accumulating knowledge
to accurately reflect the realm of politics it should describe. [For
Queer International Theory, this means making it its 'business to study
the states-system, the diplomatic community itself']{.underline} (Wight,
1966: 22). Queer International Theory only comes into existence by
performing the same function as Queer Political Theory. This illustrates
the performative aspect of figuration. [Performativity expresses how
repeated iterations of acts constitute the subjects who are said to be
performing them]{.underline} (Butler, 1990). Haraway argues that
['\[f\]igurations are performative images that can be inhabited'
(]{.underline}1997: 11). Applying this to Wight's homology, [Queer
Political Theory is the performative image --- the body of knowledge
that is the effect of ritualistically repeated practices of specific
forms of knowledge collection --- that Queer International Theory must
inhabit through its disciplinary performances in order to
exist.]{.underline} What we have with Wight's homology, then, is a
figuration taking the form of a mathematical equation that posits the
pathway to success charted by Queer Political Theory as the
developmental and performative goal of Queer International Theory.
Wight's homology [shows queer international theories/theorists the one
true path to theoretical success, and, in so doing, it delivers them
from failure]{.underline}. As the logical formula for disciplinary
success, Wight's [homology maps the superhighway to the accumulation of
intellectual capital and the disciplinary power that comes with it that
queer international theories so far lack.]{.underline} By charting this
and only this course to theoretical and disciplinary success, Wight's
homology provides Queer IR theorists with the final aspect that Haraway
argues all figurations possess, worlding. Like figurations in general,
[Wight's homology 'map\[s\] universes of knowledge, practice, and
power']{.underline} (Haraway, 1997: 11). Successful practice is
'studying the states-system, the diplomatic community itself' (Wight,
1966: 22). Successful knowledge is the developmental, cumulative, and
representational result of this practice. And [power is the disciplinary
capital one acquires by being practically and knowledgably
successful.]{.underline} Wight's figurations of theoretical success and
failure are remarkably similar to Halberstam's figurations of success
and failure in queer theory. But these figurations are Weber 37 valued
and mobilized in significantly different ways. While Wight's aim is to
identify failure so international theories (like queer international
theories) can overcome it, Halberstam's aim is to identify failure so
queer theories and queer people can revel in it as a way of undoing
disciplines and disciplinization. This is strategically possible because
Halberstam understands queer failure (a term he9 borrows from Jose Munoz
(2010) and refines through the work of Lee Edelman (2005)) as a
productive negativity that can be deployed to 'dismantle the logics of
success and failure with which we currently live' (2011: 2). To make
this case, Halberstam begins much like Wight does --- by defining
success and figuring failure in its wake. Couching his discussion of
success and failure in the context of 'a heternormative, capitalist
society,' Halberstam argues that such [societies equate success with
'specific forms of reproductive maturity combined with wealth
accumulation]{.underline}' (2011: 2). Halberstam's aim is to deploy
queer failure to interrupt and disrupt heteromaturity and wealth
accumulation (2011: 92). To do this, Halberstam makes two important
moves. First, he [claims failure as something intrinsic to
queers.10]{.underline} Halberstam writes of [failure as 'something
queers do and have always done exceptionally wel]{.underline}l' (2011:
3). Not only do queers fail, they fail with flair. '\[F\]or queers,
failure can be a style, to cite Quentin Crisp, or a way of life, to cite
Foucault' (2011: 3). Given this, Halberstam suggests that [queers are
the prototypes of failure]{.underline} (2011: 3). Second, Halberstam
specifically figures queer failure by using all the elements Haraway
associates with figuration. [Queer failure is worlding because if
success is the heterosexual matrix that establishes 'the punishing norms
that discipline behavior and manage human development with the goal of
delivering us from unruly childhoods to orderly and predictable
adulthoods']{.underline} (2011: 3), then qu[eer failure (like failure
itself) is 'the map of political paths not taken']{.underline} (2011:
19). [Still on the map but perversely off course, Halberstam claims
queer failure challenges heterosexual orthodoxies and how they model
queer lives and queer futures. Queer failure is temporal because it
rejects developmental temporalities (to normatively grow up, reproduce,
and accumulate capital) that lead to theoretical and personal maturity
in the terms successful theorizing and living demand (]{.underline}2011:
3). As such, [queer failure repudiates the salvation narrative found in
classical Christian and contemporary secular figuration]{.underline}s.
The temporality of queer failure is instead a counter-temporality --- a
refusal to mature in heteronormative terms --- that is situated more
broadly in Halberstam's Gramscian-inspired counter-hegemonic queer
politics. [Queer failure's reliance upon tropes is evidenced by its
figurative rather than literal strategies to interrupt and disrupt
success. For example, queer failure might strategically inhabit
~~stupidity~~ \[unintelligence\] --- not literally by lacking knowledge
but figuratively by miming 'unteachability' in the modes of conduct
prescribed by the dominant heterosexist matrix.]{.underline} By
displacing 'real ~~stupidity~~ \[unintelligence\]~~'~~ for 'figural
~~stupidity~~ \[unintelligence\],' [queer failure exposes 'the limits of
certain forms of knowing and certain ways of inhabiting structures of
knowing' (]{.underline}Halberstam, 2011: 11--12; see also Ranciere,
1991). In this way, [queer failure becomes a refusal to be read, which
becomes a refusal to be normatively streamed down the pathways of
success.]{.underline} Finally, [queer failure is performative because
--- as the ritualistic repetition of undisciplinable performances by
queer bodies that are incongruous with the dominant heterosexist
matrix]{.underline} --- queer failure interrupts and disrupts success
and produces alternative images of (un)being and (un)knowing that
failing queer bodies might inhabit (Halberstam, 2011: 23). Not all
failure is queer failure. For example, Halberstam argues that the film
Trainspotting illustrates 'unqueer failure.' For even though the
characters in this film reject productive love and wealth accumulation,
their drug-fueled lifestyle becomes 'the rage of the excluded white
male, a rage that promises and delivers punishments for women and people
of color' (2011: 92). In contrast, Halberstam argues that [queer failure
is a negativity that interrupts and disrupts heteromaturity and wealth
accumulation --- and is 'productively linked to racial awareness,
anticolonial struggle, gender variance, and different formulations of
the temporality of success']{.underline} (2011: 92). Collectively, these
points allow Halberstam to tell the story of failure differently, as 'a
tale of anticapitalist, queer struggle' set within a narrative about
'anticolonial struggle, the refusal of legibility, and an art of
unbecoming' (2011: 88). In that story, queer failure is 'a way of
refusing to acquiesce to dominant logics of power and discipline and
\[is\] a form of critique' (2011: 88). Were Halberstam's figuration of
queer failure to live up to its promise and were it to be embraced by
international theorists and applied to international theories, it might
well achieve for international theories what Halberstam argues it
achieves for queer theory. It might elevate the detours of international
theories off the disciplinary pathways of success into valued
philosophical insights. This could bring Queer International Theory
'into existence.' For if, as Halberstam suggests, 'queer is the art of
elevating perversion to philosophy' (Halberstam, quoted in Ristic,
2013), [then Queer International Theory might be accepted as an (artful)
instance of elevating 'queer perversions' of IR's disciplinary pathways
to knowledges, practices, and power into valuable queer philosophical
insights about Queer International Politics.]{.underline} This might be
an attractive option for IR scholars doing queer international
theorizing. Yet, it would require several leaps of faith on their part
to move from Halberstam's [celebration of queer failure to a Queer
International Theory that is not so hampered by disciplinary knowledges,
practices, and power that they would be left with anything to
celebrate]{.underline}. This is not only because many of the positions
Halberstam attributes to queer failure are worthy political aims he
attaches to queer failure rather than generates from it (e.g. that queer
failure is necessarily anticolonial, illegible, counter
hetero-/homonormative, and counter-hegemonic), making his claims more
idealistic than realistic (which he admits). It is also because, as
Halberstam figures it, queer failure does not ultimately 'dismantle the
logics of success and failure with which we currently live' (2011: 1).
Rather, Halberstam performs a radical reversal --- not a dismantling ---
of success and failure with his notion of queer failure, marking success
as something that fails queer bodies and failure as something that
successfully liberates queer bodies from the burdens of conventionally
understood success and failure (2011: 3--4). From the standpoint of a
[Disciplinary IR (un)consciously governed by Wight's homologizing
technology of the conduct of international theorizing, nothing could be
more alarming.]{.underline} For the point of Wight's homologization and
[its figuration of failure is to move IR scholars from the 'perversion'
of misapplying themselves to their studies of international politics to
correcting how and what they study]{.underline}. This spirit is
encapsulated in the title of Barry Buzan and Richard Little's
Wight-inspired essay, 'Why international relations has failed as an
intellectual project and what to do about it' (2001). If this analysis
of Wight's figuration of failure tells us anything, it is that charting
the course toward international theories' salvation was always Wight's
motivation for naming their sins. Halberstam's figuration of queer
failure ultimately proves unhelpful for escaping Wight's homologization.
This is not primarily because it departs from Wight by celebrating 'the
sin' of failure. Rather, Halberstam's figuration of queer failure is at
its weakest where it charts the very same course as does Wight's
homology. That course is to take the worlds and the mappings of success
and failure (but not, in Halberstam's case, their values) as given. In
so doing, both Wight and Halberstam overlook how 'figurations are
condensed maps of contestable worlds' (Haraway, 1997: 11, my emphasis).
To call these contestable worlds into question requires not just
revaluing their terms, but challenging how they are mapped. It comes as
no surprise that Wight performs this neglect in how he maps success and
failure. For [he attempts to place any contestability of his worlding
practices beyond discussion through his recourse to
'mathematics.']{.underline} Not only does [Wight definitively figure
international theories as failures by excluding them from his equation,
Wight figures success as something that can only be achieved by
following Wight's dubious calculations.]{.underline} What is more
surprising is that Halberstam performs this same neglect, by never
contesting how 'the dominant system' maps success and failure. For while
he revalues failure as success and argues that '\[f\]ailure is the map
of political paths not taken,' he still insists that failure 'does not
chart a completely separate land; failure's by-ways are all the spaces
in between the superhighways of \[intellectual\] capital' (2011: 19). In
charting these specific pathways to queer failure, Halberstam accepts a
worlding of success and failure that is strikingly similar to Wight's.
This allows Wight's chartings of successful international theoretical
practice ('studying the states-system, the diplomatic community itself';
1966: 22), knowledge (the developmental, cumulative, and
representational result of this practice), and power (the disciplinary
capital one acquires by being practically and knowledgably successful)
to remain intact. What this means is that 'the punishing norms that
discipline behavior and manage human development' (Halberstam, 2011: 3)
--- while disavowed by Halberstam --- continue to be applied to any
theory that would dare to call itself International Theory. Halberstam's
neglect to query success is, I suspect, a result of his overinvestment
in failure. For Halberstam imbues failure with an authentically queer
essence. Were he to remap success --- tear up its maps, dig up its
roads, focus on how success employs its power to zigzag around and pave
over its own innumerable failures in its attempt to make us think it
never swerves from literal-mindedness --- he would also be required to
remap failure, rethink queer, and rethink his investment in queer
failure. This may well explain why Halberstam, like Wight, places the
pathways (but not the value) of success beyond contestability. Were IR
scholars doing queer international theorizing to embrace Halberstam's
celebration of queer failure, they would suffer from these same
shortcomings. As a result, they would not disrupt Disciplinary IR's
ideal of disciplinary success any more than Halberstam does, even as
they repudiated disciplinary success in favor of a Queer International
Theory revalued as successful failure. Should they embrace this move, it
could have three unwanted consequences. First, it could further exclude
Queer IR scholars from participating in refiguring what success and
failure mean for/in Disciplinary IR and how they are applied to
international theorizing. Second, it could forfeit any demand that
Disciplinary IR evaluate queer international theories as successful in
terms that Disciplinary IR already regards as constituting success ---
contributing to understandings about interstate relations. Finally, it
could unwittingly confirm what Disciplinary IR already believes --- that
Queer International Theory is not a figuration it wishes to inhabit. As
a field shamed by its failure and determined to achieve success in
conventional terms, celebrations of queer failure may not only convince
Disciplinary IR that Queer International Theory does not exist. They may
convince the discipline more generally that Queer International Theory
must not exist. For this reason celebrations of queer failure may
unintentionally participate in authorizing the final step in
Disciplinary IR's disavowal of queer international theories. That step
is gentrification.

**Queer IR is appropriated into the disciplinary academy through a
process of ideological gentrification whereby critical divergence is
supplanted with a domesticated and homogenized version of genuine
radicality -- embracing the 1AC's deviant scholarship is a bulwark
against academic assimilation.**

Gentrifying failure There is a gentrification that happens to buildings
and neighborhoods and there is a gentrification that happens to ideas.
(Artist Penny Arcade, 1996, quoted in Schulman, 2012b: 29) In this
section, I argue that [Wight's homology authorizes the substitution of
ideas produced by 'failing' queer international theories with ideas
produced by a 'successful' type of International Theory of Disciplinary
IR's choosing]{.underline}. To make this argument, I apply Sarah
Schulman's analysis of what she calls '[the gentrification of the
mind']{.underline} (2012b) to a discussion of what I call ['the
neighborhood of IR.']{.underline} Conceptualizing IR as a neighborhood
is gestured toward but not elaborated on in Anna Agathangelou and L.H.M.
Ling's 'The house of IR' (2004), in which they map relations among IR
traditions as those of a multi generational family led by 'Grand Pater
Imperialism' and 'Grand Mater Capitalism' and their spawn, including
Realism and Liberalism living upstairs, with support from
'Native-Informant Servants' like Area Studies living downstairs. While
Agathangelou and Ling's characterization of IR as a house offers useful
insights into how IR is organized, it does not capture the movement
amongst traditions within the discipline. We get no sense of the comings
and goings of 'family members,' of who gets booted out of a bedroom to
accommodate a new arrival, of whose intellectual capital is rising or
falling, and of which tradition has accepted a makeover to avoid being
shunned. [If we were to remap IR as a neighborhood, the dynamic nature
of the discipline would be more apparent. We could take account of who
is sitting on prime real estate, how urban/disciplinary blight and
renewal shake things up, and how (re-)zoning organizes IR's complex
living arrangements. Diagramed in this way, one specific force
organizing the houses of IR would become apparent ---
gentrification.]{.underline} The term gentrification was coined by the
British sociologist Ruth Glass to describe 'the influx of middle-class
people to cities and neighborhoods, displacing the lower-class worker
residents' (Schulman, 2012b: 24). But as the artist Penny Arcade notes,
[gentrification does not just happen to buildings and neighborhoods. It
also happens to ideas.]{.underline} Sarah Schulman traces how the
physical gentrification of 'failing' urban neighborhoods leads to the
gentrification of ideas, what she calls 'the gentrification of the mind'
(2012b). For by moving diverse people out of buildings, one is also
moving diverse ideas out of neighborhoods. Schulman describes
[gentrification as the replacement of mix with homogeneity while
pretending difference and privilege do not exist]{.underline} (2012b).
Among the key elements Schulman identifies as part of the gentrification
process are [substitution, homogenization, and
assimilation.]{.underline} Substitution refers to the physical
replacement of mix with sameness. Thanks to zoning laws that refigure
where prime real estate is located, formerly poor, mixed, 'failing'
neighborhoods are 'regenerated' by moving in wealthy, predominantly
white residents. As wealthy residents move in, high-class businesses
appear, real estate and rental prices soar, and poor residents are
priced out of their own neighborhoods. This not only has the effect of
driving out people marked by difference. It also recategorizes these
'different' residents as dangers to newly gentrified communities. 'The
relaxed nature of neighborhood living becomes threatening, something to
be eradicated and controlled' (2012b: 28). This is because gentrifiers
'brought the values of the gated community and a willingness to trade
freedom for security' with them (2012b: 30) and therefore 'sought a
comfort in overpowering the natives, rather than becoming them' (2012b:
30). As former residents disappear, so too do their ideas and ways of
living. The lived realities, tastes, points of view, and stories of the
rich and powerful replace those of former inhabitants. Traces remain,
but in the form of what Schulman calls 'the "fusion" phenomena.' Fusion
is expressed by the kind of food one sees in gentrified neighborhoods
--- food with 'toned-down flavors, made with higher quality ingredients
and at significantly higher prices, usually owned by whites, usually
serving whites.' More troublingly, it is equally present in the
toned-down, ever-blander, simplistic, and superficial ideas that replace
the complexity of ideas and relationships that marked pre-gentrified
mixed neighborhoods (2012b: 31). This intellectual homogenization is
part of what Schulman means when she refers to the gentrification of the
mind. Because they control the story that is told about themselves,
gentrifiers believe 'that corporate support for and inflation of their
story is in fact a neutral and accurate picture of the world' (2012b:
28). In this way, gentrification erases not only difference, but the
economic, political, social, and cultural privilege that makes it
possible for gentrifiers to erase difference because 'gentrification is
a process that hides the apparatus of domination from the dominant
themselves' (2012b: 27). Not only is gentrification naturalized as a
pure good, with the costs to replaced populations erased. Gentrification
encourages all those living in gentrified neighborhoods to internalize
gentrified values and assimilate to gentrified modes of conduct. As
Schulman explains it, 'There is a weird passivity that accompanies
gentrification' (2012b: 33). 'It's like a hypnotic identification with
authority' (2012b: 34), which brings with it 'an acceptance of banality,
a concept of self based falsely in passivity, an inability to realize
one's self as a powerful instigator and agent of profound social change'
(2012b: 13--14). This is the final component of what Schulman calls the
gentrification of the mind. 42 European Journal of International
Relations 21(1) Schulman made her argument to explain the 1990s'
gentrification of her East Village New York City neighborhood and how
this gentrification was enabled in part by the loss of a generation of
edgy artists and queer activists to AIDS. What Schulman observed in her
neighborhood parallels the theoretical gentrification of the
neighborhood of IR, where substitution, homogenization, and assimilation
have replaced the 'wrong' kinds of theoretical, epistemological, and
methodological mix with disciplinary homogeneity while pretending
difference and privilege do not exist (2012b). [The poorest
neighborhoods of IR have always been those populated by new intellectual
immigrants to IR. These include Marxists, poststructuralists, feminists,
critical race scholars, postcolonial scholars, critical studies
scholars, and queer studies scholars. These scholars are poor because
they wield the least disciplinary capital in IR.]{.underline} This is
because [their analyses deviate from an exclusive focus on 'the
states-system, the diplomatic community itself']{.underline} (Wight,
1966: 22) and because [they refuse Disciplinary IR's epistemological and
methodological claims about knowledge collection and
accumulation.]{.underline} Rather, [these residents debate everything
from post-positivism to gender and sexuality hierarchies, to the global
dominance of neoliberalism and empire, as well as how and why these
ideas, epistemologies, methodologies, and phenomena shape international
politics.]{.underline} There have been numerous turf wars amongst these
scholars over the years, yet, for the most part, this mix of relative
newcomers to the discipline have peacefully lived together in their
broadly defined 'critical theory' enclave (Cox, 1981), a kind of East
Village of multiple, interdisciplinary-mixed IRs whose residents have
relatives in a vast range of other disciplinary neighborhoods. From time
to time, Disciplinary IR scholars have visited this enclave to sample
its ideas. This happens most frequently when Disciplinary IR is in
crisis, as it was, for example, when it failed to predict the end of the
Cold War. During that period in the late 1980s to early 1990s, this East
Village of IRs became a go-to location for new insights into the
workings of international politics. This put critical IR on Disciplinary
IR's map as an up-and-coming area, thus raising the disciplinary capital
of critical IR scholars, however temporarily. But visits by Disciplinary
IR scholars to this area could be dangerous. The ideas and approaches of
Disciplinary IR scholars were not accorded the same respect here as they
were elsewhere in the discipline (e.g. Ashley, 1984; Weber, 2010). What
some Disciplinary IR scholars saw as their generous engagements with and
support for emerging critical IR traditions were met with what they
experienced as aggressive assaults on their core ideas and on the
character of Disciplinary IR itself. In contrast, critical IR scholars
saw themselves battling to save their neighborhood from IR's
disciplinary takeover (see Keohane, 1989; and in reply, Weber, 1994c).
[These 'non-productive' engagements added to the growing sense that
critical IR was failing Disciplinary IR]{.underline} (Holsti, 1985).
For, at least from Disciplinary IR's perspective, these exchanges
introduced dangerous mix into disciplinary homogeneity (Keohane, 1988)
[and detracted from rather than enhanced IR's core goal --- to
progressively accumulate knowledge about interstate wars. Once critical
IR was marked as a failure, it could legitimately be 'regenerated' by
'overpowering the natives, rather than becoming them']{.underline}
(Schulman, 2012b: 30). Employing the gentrification toolkit,
[Disciplinary IR first re-zoned critical IR's enclave and then subjected
it to substitutions.]{.underline} Recognizing that this peripheral area
producing marginalized intellectual ideas could potentially re-center
and revive a discipline in crisis, some Disciplinary IR scholars took up
residence in this edgy neighborhood. As their numbers reached a
(non-)critical mass, institutional authorities took notice and amended
publishing and hiring strategies that effectively re-zoned this outlying
turf as central to disciplinary regeneration. But making critical IR's
areas of investigation central to Disciplinary IR's regeneration came
with costs. Those costs were incurred through the gentrification
strategies of substitution, homogenization, and assimilation. [The hard,
troubling, political edges of critical IR were substituted with the
softer, more soothing critiques of Disciplinary IR that left most
critical politics behind]{.underline}. A generalized international
political economy was offered as a replacement for Marxism (Strange,
1988), 'the gender variable' for feminism (Jones, 1996; in reply see
Carver et al., 1998), constructivism for poststructuralism (Wendt,
1992), '[the clash of civilisations' for critical race and postcolonial
studies (H]{.underline}untington, 1993), and '[soft power' in the
service of state power for cultural critique]{.underline} (Nye, 2004).
This is not to say that critical IR traditions disappeared. Rather, they
were pushed off what was becoming some of the discipline's prime real
estate and beyond the barricades of Disciplinary IR's newly erected
gated communities (e.g. most of IR's top 20 journals). This made
critical IR's status in the discipline all the more precarious, which
[enabled the homogenization of critical IR's ideas through 'the fusion
effect.']{.underline} This [created toned-down gentrified versions of
critical IR's ideas that were compatible with both what Disciplinary IR
most valued]{.underline} (being 'a realist and a statist'; e.g. Wendt,
1992) and what Disciplinary IR viewed as being critical enough. [With
homogenization came assimilation]{.underline}. From the perspective of
'old school' critical IR scholars, [gentrified 'critical' IR scholars
exhibited 'a weird passivity']{.underline} (Schulman, 2012: 33) about
the political stakes of critical IR aims [and 'a hypnotic identification
with authority']{.underline} (2012b: 34) as [they themselves became the
new authorities within Disciplinary IR]{.underline} (Wendt, 1992). There
seemed to be [little if any critical self-reflection on how disciplinary
privilege and power enabled and sustained this reorganizing of IR's
living arrangements.]{.underline} And there seemed to be no awareness
within Disciplinary IR that its attempts to insulate itself from
internal critique limited its ability to generate expert knowledge about
international politics broadly and narrowly defined. Or, to put it in
Schulman's terms, Disciplinary IR did not grasp the relationship between
the gentrification of a neighborhood and 'the gentrification of the
mind' (2012b). In fairness to Disciplinary IR scholars who were
practicing at this time, how could they have grasped this connection?
How could they have avoided doing precisely what they did? For the
gentrification of critical IR had it roots not just in the failure of IR
to predict the end of the Cold War. It had its roots in Martin Wight's
famous homology. This may well have had two (un)conscious consequences.
First, it may have stirred up Disciplinary IR's nagging doubts about the
discipline of IR. It may have led Disciplinary IR scholars to ask if
Wight was right, if IR is a failing discipline because it produces no
successful International Theory. Even though Wight's test of success is
not predicting future events but rather accumulating knowledge about
states and the states-system, Disciplinary (and especially Realist) IR
scholars at the time lamented the fact that the knowledge they had been
accumulating about international politics left them ~~blindsided
\[~~caught unaware\] by the end of the Cold War. As a result, [securing
the viability of the discipline]{.underline} urgently rose to the top of
many Disciplinary IR scholars' agendas. Second, while Wight's iconic
reading of International Theory as failure may have stung at this time,
it also [provided the solution Disciplinary IR scholars
needed]{.underline}. If Wight could rescue the discipline of IR by
substituting Historical Interpretation for failing international
theories, then Disciplinary IR could substitute all manner of discipline
supporting gentrified theories for discipline-challenging critical
theories of these multiple IRs. (Un)Consciously taking Wight's homology
as their licensing proof, [Disciplinary IR scholars not only erased much
of the critical difference within IR; they seemed to do so without any
consideration of how this might impoverish IR
intellectually.]{.underline} This is because --- as Wight's homology
taught them --- securing disciplinary success overrides insuring
intellectual freedom. Following in Wight's footsteps, Disciplinary IR
continues to make these moves. It substitutes 'successful' (often
gentrified) International Theory wherever and whenever 'failed'
international theories threaten it with good, but unpalatable, ideas and
challenges. Which brings us back to queer international theories. Queer
international theories are ripe for gentrification by Disciplinary IR
for three reasons. [First, queer international theories are producing
intellectual insights that could prove valuable to the
discipline]{.underline}. By analyzing how sexual- and gender-variant
identities, hierarchies, institutions, and systems function
internationally, it investigates war, security, terrorism, sovereignty,
intervention, hegemony, nationalism, empire, and foreign policy more
generally and [contributes to understandings of interstate wars and
international politics understood more broadly.]{.underline} Second,
[queer international theories occupy just enough real estate for the
discipline to take an interest in their (re)generation]{.underline}.
Thanks to support from the ISA via the LGBTQA Caucus and the Feminist
and Gender Section, [queer international theories are slowly but
steadily being institutionalized into the neighborhood of
IR.]{.underline} Third, [by breaking most of the rules about what
successful International Theory is supposed to be (singular, focused
exclusively on interstate wars, respectful of political
theory/international theory and domestic/international boundaries,
eschewing 'low theory,' driven to accumulate disciplinary knowledge
without questioning disciplinary knowledge in epistemologically and
methodologically 'unproductive ways'), queer international theories are
figured as failures]{.underline} in Wight's terms. Taken together, this
means that [queer international theories might be just enough of a
success in their own terms and just enough of a failure in Disciplinary
IR's terms for the discipline more broadly to, at some point in the
not-too-distant future, come to regard queer international theories as
(another) dangerous difference that must be re-zoned.]{.underline} How
might queer international theories be gentrified? Or, to ask this
question in Wight's terms: if queer international theories were to be
homologized as Queer Politics:Queer International Politics = Queer
Theory:X, what might 'X' out queer international theories? Queer
international theories would likely be 'X-ed' out by some form of
gentrified 'Critical' International Theory. If Disciplinary IR
associated queer international theories with poststructuralism, then
they would likely be substituted with constructivism. If they were
associated with feminism, then queer international theories might be
placed in a Weber 45 'sexuality variable' that strips them of all
political critique (Weber, 1998c). If they were associated with cultural
studies, then they might be mobilized for their soft power in the
service of state power. And so on. In whatever way they might be
substituted, homogenized, and assimilated, queer international theories
in anything resembling their current form would be gentrified out of
existence. This [would allow Disciplinary IR scholars and gentrified
'critical' IR scholars alike to authoritatively declare about gentrified
'Queer' International Theory: 'There is Queer International Theory. It
does exist. But only on our terms,]{.underline} which are Wight's
terms.'

landscape of IR is a repetitive fantasy of discipline that seeks

In the wake of the enduring popularity of the argument that there might
be an "end of IR theory" (Dunne et al., 2013), [we see a world in which
IR theorizing is alive, even if only in repetitive fantasy, and key to
disciplinary identification for whatever "IR" is]{.underline}. Some of
the responses to the "end of IR theory" argue for a retreat from grand
theory to middle-level theory (e.g., Lake, 2013); [others warn of a
"cacophony" that needs categorization to be comprehensible]{.underline}
(Jackson & Nexon, 2013, p. 543); [still others call for either
re-terming schools of IR (Michelson, 2020) or combining analytic
approaches]{.underline} (Grieco, 2019). While we see theory's continued
importance even in scholars' confusion about its appropriate role, we
recognize, [with those who declare theory's end in the discipline, that
something has changed in the structure and function of theorizing among
scholars interested in global politics]{.underline}. **[That something,
we argue, is the simultaneous recognition of and denial of the failure
of IR theorizing]{.underline}**. We contend that **[IR theorizing is
both failing and necessarily failed]{.underline}**, but that does not
make it over. Instead, we argue, [drawing on queer theory, that failure
in/of grand IR theory is something to be celebrated and actively
participated in]{.underline}. With many queer theorists (e.g.,
Halberstam, 2011), we argue that failure, rather than a normative bad,
can be a necessary corrective to the intellectual and disciplinary
stagnation implied by and implicated in practiced and accepted standards
of success. We argue that **[overwrought debates about the state of IR
theorizing could learn from queer methodology]{.underline}** (e.g.,
Weber, 2014a) **[and queer theorizing]{.underline}** (e.g., Weber,
2016a) **[not only about global politics but also about the nature of
knowledge and disciplinary politics.]{.underline}** [Queer IR has asked
how cultural ideas about gender and sexuality shape global politics, and
how heteronormative, homonormative, and cisnormative frameworks have
shaped the ways the world works]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit, 2018).
It has also turned its lenses inward, asking [why queer scholarship has
had as little influence on IR theorizing as it has]{.underline} (Weber,
2016b), and how **[queering IR could change IR's
methodological]{.underline}** (Weber, 2014a) **[and
theoretical]{.underline}** (Weber, 2014b) **[landscapes]{.underline}**.
This article looks at a small but in our view important piece of that
puzzle---how taking queer work seriously might provide insight about the
(sometimes endless) state-of-the-field debates. We see these
state-of-the-field assertions, arguments, and debates as first and
foremost recursive. Sometimes they are romances, explaining the breaking
developments that provide hopeful next steps for a blooming field (e.g.,
Acharya, 2014; Berenskotter, 2017). Sometimes they are tragedies,
spelling gloom and doom for IR as an enterprise (if not academia as a
whole) or even global politics itself (e.g., Aistrope & Fishel, 2020;
Stevens & Michelsen, 2020). Other times, they are dramas with various
players and various arguments taking various starring roles in sparring
matches (e.g., Jackson & Nexon, 2009; Parashar, 2013). Sometimes they
are histories, tracing the past into the present or the present into the
past (Alekseyeva, 2016; Schmidt & Guilhot, 2019). Sometimes they are
sociologies, explaining how this and that theory relates to this and
that other theory (Aris, 2020; Barkin & Sjoberg, 2019). Sometimes they
are serials, explaining how particular approaches ebb and flow or evolve
(e.g., Epstein, 2013; Guzzini, 2013). Sometimes they are sports reports,
talking about which side wins what when (e.g., Acharya, 2005; Legro &
Moravcsik, 1999). [Most state-of-the-field evaluations make the various
protagonists and antagonists (theories or theorists) seem so at odds, so
different, and the stakes of the debates so dire.]{.underline} We argue
that, with few exceptions, these stories, despite their different forms,
different characters, and different plotlines, are all the same. They
are [more often than not the product of gender, sex, race, sexuality,
national origin, education, and employment privilege that produce a
narrow view of what is and what should be, based on the practices that
have provided the success from which the privileged writer
writes]{.underline}. As Weber (2014b, p. 29) argues, "**[disciplinary
IR's commitments and standards are as much the performative result of
the so-called 'mainstream' agendas of learned societies, universities,
independent funding agencies, and governments ... as they are the
performative outcome of so-called 'dissident' practices"]{.underline}**
(citing Ashley & Walker, 1990; Soreanu, 2010). In fact, Weber suggests
that the [radical critical edge of IR and its mainstream "foes" are
really "intricately intertwined positions" which "produce a disciplinary
IR that claims to speak for the whole of the discipline" out of power
rather than legitimacy]{.underline} (Weber, 2014b, p. 29). In concrete
terms, we argue that the **[current "state" of state-of-the-field
stories and debates is intimately and necessarily tied not only to
heteronormative, traditionalized rules and norms of scholarly practice
but also to heteronormative, traditionalized understandings of success,
failure, and their value.]{.underline}** In this article, we argue that
the things that the state-of-the-field literature agrees on betray a
narrow and problematic approach to what knowledge is, how it works, who
has it, and how it can be. We suggest that **[IR]{.underline}** on these
terms **[is always and already a failed enterprise]{.underline}**, [no
matter what spin the stateof-the-field literature puts on]{.underline}
[it]{.underline}. **[IR fails to reach any expected or desired end of
the enterprise of IR theorizing. It fails to achieve coherence or fails
to approximate some measure]{.underline}** (citations, downloads, and
publisher quality) socially understood as failure's opposite. **[It
fails to find clarity or directions]{.underline}**. **[It fails because
it must---its idealized goals are unachievable and require it to be
something that it cannot be]{.underline}**, [and remain its seductive
unquestioned/unquestionable ends, despite an obvious need for
reevaluation and, possibly, the embrace of failure]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1991 \[1979\]; Halberstam, 2011). Rather than arguing that
IR's success and failure need to be redefined, we contend that IR's
success and failure need to be normatively reinterpreted. We argue that
seeing IR as a failure, and embracing its failings, provides a realistic
and intellectually grounded path for IR's "futures," putting to rest the
state-of-the-field fairy tales and encyclopedias once and for all.

**The paradigm of IR relies on the valorization of traditional research
as a metric of "success" -- voting negative imbricates debate in the
echo chamber of normative political theory that accumulates rigid forms
of knowledge while reproducing the exclusion of queerness.**

We argue that **[knowledge cumulation in IR is a fantasy reified by
paradigmatic clusters and the mimicry of research standards and
practices in the natural sciences]{.underline}** (e.g., Elman & Elman,
2001, 2003). The "evidence" of "knowledge cumulation" in IR comes as
much from the ritualized practice of research behavior as it does from
any "true" or genuine notion of knowledge cumulation. One has
"succeeded" in the enterprise of IR by cumulating knowledge, and the
work of "successful" scholars is by definition cumulated knowledge.
Cumulation of knowledge as a standard of success is a condition of
possibility for the desirability of success in the field. That
ritualized practice at once is institutionalized as success and
institutionalizes the need for research success, reified and reproduced
by hiring, tenure, merit raise, and promotion standards. This
ritualization is a signifier that what counts as knowledge in the field,
in particular research programs and more generally, is performative
(Barad, 2007; Butler, 1990; Weber, 1998)---where standards are set by
their utterance and repetition rather than by some external "objective"
standards of (narrowly) good science or (more broadly) good research
(Baudrillard, 1991; Shepherd, 2008; Williams, 2003). Scholars iterate
and reify standards of measurement of knowledge in each piece of
scholarship which "succeeds" in the field, and these iterations make it
a paradox for scholars to both occupy the methodological,
epistemological, and political space that falls outside of inherited
standards and succeed. Outside -the -mainstream work's
underrepresentation in the places understood to be publishing "success"
is overdetermined, and the correlation between mimicry of traditional
scholarship and "success" of critical scholars a given. We mean
"performative" in the sense that Judith Butler uses it (Butler, 1990,
1993), particularly as she talks about it going hand in hand with a
Foucauldian notion of disciplining,8 where "performativity cannot be
understood outside of a process of iterability---a regularized and
constrained repetition of norms" which resonate as "ritualized
production" (Butler, 1993, p. 60). This frames performativity as a
"specific modality of power as discourse" (Butler, 1993, p. 139) where
the politics of the signification and the politics of the sign meet, an
act of territoralization, of production, of installation---which does
not have to be alone, singular, or unidirectional. Since performatives
are their own referent (Butler, 1993, p. 159), they proliferate as
manifestations of the power underlying them and interact relatively on
the basis of that relative power. In this context, "performances" are
actions and events, iterations and reifications, and context-specific,
which "bring a subject into being" relationally.9 To escape the
recursive, performative loop of "disciplinary success," we argue that it
is important to see the possibility that knowledge cumulation is not,
and should not be, a given in IR research. Instead, we argue that the
idea itself is an inherited empty signifier with unspoken content which
governs the production of what we understand as disciplinary IR.
Traditionally, the idea of knowledge cumulation is firmly grounded in a
neopositivist understanding of social science, in which the role of
theory is to collate observed empirical regularities across cases or
what Waltz calls laws (Waltz, 1979). While this interpretation is
critiqued in most critical IR, "cumulation," in that work, becomes a
term without clear conceptual content. The paradigmatization of IR
theorizing distracts from a particular theory's internal conditions of
possibility by introducing incompatible conditions of possibility drawn
from an inherited disciplinary sociology of what knowledge is and how it
works. As such, any acknowledgment of the idea of cumulativity from
within specific exercises in reflexive IR creates the grounds for
necessary failure within those exercises. The simultaneous rejection of
traditional "cumulation" and continued performance of acts of cumulation
can be understood by seeing the ways that silence frames cumulation in
critical IR. We learn from feminist theorists that the unspoken is as
important as if not more important than what is spoken (Charlesworth,
1999; Kronsell, 2006), coming from attention to how IR's others are
omitted, excluded, kept out, and not mentioned (Agathangelou & Ling,
2004; Tickner, 1988). We argue that IR's silences tell us more about the
state of knowledge cumulation in the discipline than looking for
standards that tell us what we do know. Accordingly, we ask on principle
what any given research program does not take account of and how
accounting for those omissions could changes analysis. We focus on both
visible omissions (like the concepts that a research program fails to
incorporate) and invisible omissions. Invisible omissions are those that
are unhearable by a research program--- normally left out or ignored by
both the researchers that form the core of the research program and
their critics (Butler, 2001; Edkins et al., 2012; Hansen, 2000). By
"unhearable," we mean either that the omitted content falls outside of
the boundaries set for dialog or is assumed by all stakeholders to be by
definition irrelevant (for deeper analyses see MacKinnon, 2006; Spivak,
1988). Unlike its visible omissions---variables that its scholars and
their critics have added to, re-operationalized, expanded on, or
suggested the inclusion of---invisible omissions are often not treated
as omissions at all within particular scholarly boundaries.10 The
discipline's "collective" standards for knowledge production, then, can
be understood as constituted by social performances of dominance rather
than founded on some given or objective notions of what science should
be. Rather than being objective judgments of quality, statements like
"this is good science" and "these results are robust" are signs without
referents used to discipline (Baudrillard, 1995). The invisible
disciplining nature of the performative standards of knowledge
cumulation is part of the story of Butler's understanding of
performativity. The other part is attention to who is excluded by claims
to knowledge cumulation (generally as well as in specific paradigmatic
situations), what is left out, and on what axes. These disciplinary
standards (both in the conventional and Foucauldian sense) make
invisible their own impossibility and their related necessary failure.
For example, a submission to a traditional IR journal in the United
States or Western Europe which makes an interesting argument, but is not
in the format of, methodologically acceptable to, inclusive of the same
forms of evidence traditionally used in, and good science to that
journal's traditional reviewers is unlikely to succeed in getting
published.11 This will generally be justified with reference to the
"quality" of the piece, and rarely if ever will questions of sex, race,
gender, class, and other axes of exclusion be discussed as producers of
the standards that then exclude on "quality" where "quality" has been
set up in a way that excludes all performances of scholarship which are
not mimicry of a particular Western, liberal model (Paolini, 1999).12
Even editors and reviewers who note the exclusionary effect of these
standards will often mourn that and move on, imagining the only possible
alternative being lacking standards, and seeing such a lack of standards
as more insidious than the exclusionary effects of using certain sets of
standards. "Knowledge cumulation" then becomes a set of reified and
artificial standards rather than a journey for truth or interest. The
answer to this quagmire is sometimes a liberal politics of inclusion
(e.g., Nedal & Nexon, 2018)---how do "we" get more women, more
minorities, and more people from underrepresented places in the world to
be able to meet the standards of good scholarship in the field? That
liberal politics of inclusion, while well-intended, can be read as a
(subtle, perhaps accidental) expansion of the violence it (formally)
seems to abate. It fails to question the utility of the existing
standards of good scholarship and assumes that those currently excluded
would be happy to change the form, shape, and/ or nature of their
scholarship to fit within the (unquestioned/unquestionable) mold of good
scholarship, either loosely or strictly understood. As Puar (2006)
argues, liberal "inclusion" to absorb the other within can be as violent
as if not more so than exclusion even as it appears progressive. That
violence is the reproduction of naturalized, bounded identities when
identities are liminal and messy when not policed (e.g., Agathangelou,
2013; Haritaworn et al., 2013; Scott, 2013). The bounded nature of IR
inclusion excludes liminality, messiness, and outsideness (e.g.,
Malksoo, 2012 ¨ ). Expanding the boundaries of IR to include any given
particular excluded work maintains an illusion of stability, hiding what
is unstable; it maintains an illusion of certainty, hiding what is in
doubt; it maintains an illusion of coherence, hiding the rebellious, the
failed, and that which remains outside (e.g., Sjoberg, 2017). Queer
theorizing of the liminality involved in unstable sex/gender identities
shows that even that which is presumed to be the most primordial (sex
identity) is really liminality hiding under supposed definition (e.g.,
Weber, 2016a). Translated to thinking about inhabitability, this
theorizing suggests that the apparent safety of (constituting then
occupying) inhabitable space hides liminality and uncertainty, and
perhaps danger, under its supposed (empirical and normative) clarity
(Haritaworn et al., 2014). Therefore, "all the repressive and reductive
strategies of power systems are already present in the internal logic of
the sign," such "that violence is an inevitable byproduct of
signification" (Baudrillard, 1981). In this way, not only do traditional
standards of knowledge make invisible their own impossibility, they hide
the violence of IR's denials of failure and continued insistence on
traveling failed paths despite the condemnation of failure and the
privileging of success. IR's continued recursive enactment of its
settled "standards" despite their obvious failure and exclusiveness
makes invisible the raced, classed, and sexed impacts of those standards
and their apparent objectivity. Baudrillard's work provides a path for
navigating this disjuncture between signs (IR's "standards") and
referents (the fantastic notion that "good scholarship" exists
objectively) (Baudrillard, 1975). He argues that "only ambivalence, as a
rupture of value... sustains a challenge to the legibility, the false
transparency of the sign... questions the evidence of the use value of
the sign (rational decoding) and of its exchange value (the discourse of
communication)." This ambivalence, Baudrillard argues, "brings the
political economy of the sign to a standstill; it dissolves the
respective definitions of symbol and referent" (Baudrillard, 1981, p.
150). Endorsing the inclusion of nontraditional perspectives,
classifying and categorizing them, and assuming inclusion's possibility
may all have violent impacts (for discussions of the violences of
inclusion see Haritaworn et al., 2013, 2014; Mbembe, 2019). Moving of
the signification "knowledge" from any referent to which it was
originally tied makes method and research performances of scholarship,
rather than (the illusive) scholarship itself. If "research" is a
performance of scholarship, "standards" for research serve to disguise
the fantastic nature of knowledge cumulation. As such, there is no space
for liminality, uncertainty, change, inadequacy, and failure in
structural rather than passing senses. Yet looking beyond the discourse
of certainty, those pervade IR. A Baudrillardian ambivalence toward
research programs and their truth statements can reveal the recursivity
of IR's standards of knowledge cumulation. This is because condemnation
or rejection of any given research program and its truth statements
endorses its assumptions about truth, as well as some of its assumptions
about what the international arena is and how it works. As such, the
idea that IR knowledge cumulation can be nothing but fantasy is
straightforward. If the reification of standards of knowledge cumulation
is a signification divorced from a referent, where the recovery of the
referent is conceptually and practically impossible, then knowledge
cumulation is and will always remain an empty signifier. The only
question is how that empty signifier directs and is directed. We suggest
that, in IR, more often than not, knowledge cumulation directs and is
directed by discursive seduction. In Baudrillard's words, seduction is
"that which extracts meaning from discourse and detracts it from its
truth" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). What makes a discourse of
knowledge, of science, and of progress seductive "is its very
appearance: the aleatory, meaningless, or ritualistic and meticulous
circulation of signs on the surface, its inflections and its nuances.
All of this effaces the content value of meaning, and this is seductive"
(Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). Therefore, if there could be an
interpretive discourse of knowledge cumulation that reached truth value,
that truth value would be selfdefeating, since "the meaning of an
interpretive discourse, by contrast, has never seduced anyone." This is
the fundamental contradiction, in Baudrillard's terms, that makes
standards for knowledge cumulation in IR internally impossible. He
explains that "every interpretive discourse wants to get beyond
appearances; this is its illusion and fraud. But getting beyond
appearances is appearance, and is hence subject to the stakes imposed by
seduction, and consequently to its own failure as discourse"
(Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). As such, what is left in/of the
failed discourse can only be the fantastic, and pretensions to success
hollow.

**Reject their disciplinary scholarship -- the potentiality of
international theory exists in the liminality of politics, in the
possibilities opened by embracing queer instability and failure.**

If IR's state-of-the-field debates are alternatively narrativized fairy
tales, we have a replacement. We suggest that the fairy tales' idealized
end can be found not in success but in failure; not in agreement but in
controversy; not in aggrandized claims but in careful thought; not in
stability but in liminality.15 It is hitching our wagon to a failure of
a discipline and acknowledging that failure that constitutes and creates
the possibility of a happily ever after for IR theory. We see the
answers to many of these questions bound up in a disciplinary IR that
has racist, sexist, heterosexist, and cissexist intellectual
orientations and remains silent about them and often the assumptions
that prop them up. But even work which decenters or critiques these
exclusions in IR, in our view, is positioned compared to or in
opposition to the discipline's existing structure. Rather than being
disappointed that IR theories are exclusive, cannot be reduced to a
single theory, cannot account for global politics as a whole, and cannot
present grand narratives of their competitive advantages visa-vis other
approaches, we suggest highlighting and inhabiting these failures.
Questioning the terms of disciplinary success as lying in a tightly
choreographed dance (peer review in elite journals) or a popularity
contest (citation count), or even in the "science" of knowledge
cumulation, we ask why empty signifiers continue to dictate value in a
wide variety of channels in IR. But we do not think redefining success
will "solve" this "problem," no matter how well-intended or radical the
redefinition is. Note that we are not denying the existence or
importance of significant transgressive work within IR, work that
rejects grand narrativizing, or other explicit or implicit attempts to
embrace failure. We are under the impression that authors critiqued here
might actually agree with our critiques, either placing themselves
within them or taking exception to them. We are not looking to signal
virtue or to exclude, simply to suggest an explicit alternative
approach. Instead of looking for an alternative, emphasizing some of the
"good" transgressions, finding another way to succeed, or recasting
success, we look to deconstruct IR's logics of success and failure, and,
with them, its mimicry of reified standards and its fantasies of
knowledge cumulation. We see rewards in embracing IR theory's failure to
live up to IR theorists' expectations of it. With Halberstam, "perhaps
most obviously, failure ... disturbs the supposedly clean boundaries
between...winners and losers" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). Declaring, and
embracing, knowledge cumulation failure (and thus, IR's intellectual
failure) "allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline
behavior" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). The relevant norms in IR are the
fetishization of science, the fetishization of progression and progress,
and the establishment and reification of boundaries of what ideas matter
to the field. In embracing failure and escaping those punishing norms
that are as violent in their inclusion (e.g., Haritaworn et al., 2014)
as they are in their exclusion, "queer studies offer us one method for
imagining, not some fantasy of an elsewhere, but existing alternatives
to hegemonic systems" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 89). It "can be a potent
form of critique,... a refusal of the norm, an indifference to
assimilation, and a route to other ways of being in the world"
(Halberstam, 2012). Here, the alternative to the hegemonic system of
claims of knowledge cumulation is the queer, understood as both liminal
and anti-heteronormative, as a foundation for theorizing more nuanced
understandings of knowledge than success or failure at cumulation. If
scholars find their affirmation in (hollow) confirmations of their
claims to knowledge cumulation, a queer politics of failure suggests a
different direction. As Halberstam recommends, "rather than resisting
endings and limits, let us instead revel in... all of our own inevitable
fantastic failures" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 187). Reveling in fantastic
failures, in terms of a queer critique of the fantasy of progressive
knowledge cumulation, has two elements: celebrating research as failure
and confronting the future given that embrace. Queer theory suggests
guidelines for embracing failure; "failing is something queers do
well"---not (only) in the self-deprecating sense of laughing at (one's
own) flaws, but also in the more fruitful sense of exposing the
ridiculousness of norms by failing to live up to them. In this sense,
queer failure is "a map of the path not taken" (Weber, 2014a, 2014b). As
such, "queerness offers the promise of failure as a way of life,...but
it is up to us whether we choose to make good on that promise in a way
that makes a detour around the usual markers of accomplishment and
satisfaction" (Halberstam, 2011, loc 3281). "Failing" to meet
expectations and being fine repudiates the salvation narrative that
accompanies the "right" rules and norms and lifts the often terrible
consequences of falling outside "the norm" while removing the privileges
of "belonging" to the category of success. The exposure and analysis of
queer failure denaturalizes the coherence of knowledge-production
performances to show the vapidity inside. We see the replacement of
"all-encompassing global theories" with those "subjugated knowledges"
which have been "buried or masked in functional coherences or formal
systemization" as a key first step but insufficient by itself
(Halberstam, 2011). Turning IR's "losers" into its "winners" would both
serve social justice and unsettle the binary itself, but rejecting the
categories writ large would both upset the politics of exclusion in
those categories and discourage the win-seeking behavior that makes
state-of-the-field debates. Celebrating failure instead "provides the
opportunity to use \[failure's\] negative effects to poke holes in the
toxic positivity of contemporary life" where "the negative thinker can
use the experience of failure to confront the gross inequalities of
everyday life" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3, 4). The "toxic positivity" in IR
theorizing is the attachment to the utility of grand theory that
cumulates knowledge which makes the inequalities in the discipline
appear to be organized by some sense of objective quality, where
"success happens to good people" and good research while failure happens
to bad work or bad people (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). Instead, we see
those inequalities as structural and standards of success in IR as
political. IR's happily ever after, then, if it is to have one, must be
in the failure, in the mess, and in rejecting both inherited
interpretations of success and of the normative relationship between
success and failure. It must be not only in not meeting expectations of
any given state-of-the-discipline proselytizing but also in instead
realizing that IR cannot and should not approximate those expectations.
It is not a progressive discipline with a singular end or an exercise in
progressive knowledge cumulation. It is instead necessarily
undisciplined---it must put aside the straightjackets of research
standards, the ego-stroking of aggrandized claims, and the authorial
voice of the telling of the discipline's past, present, and future---to
embrace liminality and the necessity (and beauty) of failure. The irony
of this argument is not lost on us. Halberstam, making the queer theory
case for celebrating failure, has become a very successful academic by
many of the traditional disciplinary standards, and The Queer Art of
Failure is a successful academic text. Many of the critics and
supporters cited here have built on academic success by their engagement
with the argument. We are bringing the case to IR, publishing it in a
academic journal, through the traditional mechanism of peer review, from
the comfort of secure and permanent academic employment. We poke holes
where those holes can be seen by those who would police the boundaries
between winners and losers. This article does not "practice" as it
"preaches," to itself upend the "winners" and "losers" in disciplinary
IR---it is couched in both necessary and unnecessary hypocrisy. But
positionally at the very least, our celebration of failure is itself a
failure---implicated in our interest in and disciplinary IR's promotion
of success. We are not arguing that failure can be made pure or that it
should be---only that it cannot and should not be escaped, especially
for the glorification of success as its perceived opposite. As we fail
at failure to demonstrate the fantasy of success, we envision a happily
ever after of failing, un-discipline, and diversity rather than a faux
idealism of synthesis, aggrandizement, "science," and disciplining.

The trope of woman-as-insect in feminist science fiction makes positive
associations between women and insect life. Graham Murphy (2008) details
this trope in science fiction works that liken matriarchal utopias to
hives, anthills or colonies unconcerned with filiation and patrilineal
descent. For Murphy (ibid.), '[becoming-insect' is a site for
non-heteronormative, utopian configurations; it embraces the
multiplicity and indeterminacy the insect represents because of its
radical difference]{.underline}. Men in these scenarios often cannot
cope, cannot embrace the 'becoming-insect', seeing it as a site of
existential threat. [This figuration of the insect and of feminist
utopia as bearing a resemblance to the social life of insects in
'swarms' is quite at odds with a contemporary materialisation of insect
life---of the 'swarm' in particular---as 'drone swarm' technology at the
forefront of military technologies. Contemporary developments in
artificial intelligence and warfare suggest that the future of warfare
will not be 'robots' as technological, individualised substitutions for
idealised (masculine) warfighters, but warfighters understood as swarms:
insect metaphors for non-centrally organised, self-organising
problem-solving. The swarm is not 'merely' a metaphor, but the
organisational basis for military tactics.]{.underline} As famously
argued by Arquilla and Ronfeldt (2000) in the RAND study Swarming and
the Future of Conflict, swarming is to be the future of war-fighting
tactics in the US. Swarming decentralises operational forces in a way
that values mobility, unique autonomy, and real-time continuous
communication (ibid.; Kosek, 2010, p. 664). [The current trend towards
the development of swarming technologies, in which artificially
intelligent 'mini drones' communicate with each other to move in random,
non-linear ways does not only blur the lines between human and
technology in the 'posthuman', but also between the human and animal,
and animal and technological]{.underline}. In 2006, the US Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (better known as DARPA) launched a
call for scientists in the US to submit 'innovative proposals to develop
technology to create insect-cyborgs' (Anthes, 2013[). 'Bio-mimetic'
technologies are considered the future of warfare, and the metaphor of
the swarm is increasingly displacing the individualised human body as
the model of artificial life.]{.underline} I have elsewhere argued that
[precision warfare in general, and drone warfare more specifically,
blurs lines between human and technology in warfare in the form of
posthuman bodies]{.underline} (Wilcox, 2015, 2017). The posthuman, as
explored by feminist theorists, such as Donna Haraway (1991, 1997), N.
Katherine Hayles (1999, 2005) and Rosi Braidotti (2002, 2013), is [a
process of formation and reformation that reworks and undermines
essentialist notions of culture and nature, biology, and technology.
Cybernetics and artificial intelligence]{.underline}, I have argued,
were [developed as means to win wars, but they end up redefining and
reorganising the boundaries of the human body in and through both
imbrication in technology and in relation to other (killable) bodies.
The challenge that the cyborg or posthuman body poses is not the
addition of new technological advances to an already-existing human
body, but of a body that is always already formed through norms and
relations to others, whether these others are human, technological or
animal]{.underline}. Rather than a figuration of peaceful communal
living, [the 'swarm' as a posthuman figuration that defies
technological/animal/human categorisation appears to be a relatively new
site for the development of (political) technologies of warfare. As a
figuration that shapes the conduct of war and political violence, it
demands new conceptualisations of the relationship between war and
gender, which displace the overarching critique of masculinism for a
more troubled and troubling posthuman and queer notion of the operation
of gender in war.]{.underline} While the swarm's ability to coordinate
without central command could suggest a 'feminised' way of approaching
war (for example, see Manjikian, 2014), I would suggest [a queer reading
of the posthuman drone swarm]{.underline} in Weber's (2016) terms,
following Sedgwick (1993), in which '[queer' means a failures to signify
gender monolithically]{.underline} (see also Daggett, 2015). As such, I
argue that [the drone swarm has a deeply ambiguous relationship between
signifiers of masculinity and femininity. My queer reading of the drone
swarm is also influenced by the ways in which forms of animal and
otherwise non-human life have played a key role in queer theorising in
recent years. The monstrous, abjected non-human and more-than-human have
been sites of appropriation for queer and trans theorisin]{.underline}g,
such as Susan Stryker's (1994; although see Stryker, 2015) trans-theory
invocation of Frankenstein, Halberstam's (2011) inspiration by animated
animals, and Chen's (2012) exploration of animality, race and queerness,
among others. Furthermore, [the drone swarm is also its own component of
a queer, necropolitical assemblage, in which the 'feminine' imaginary of
insectoid life and the swarm becomes a core component of weaponised
technologies]{.underline}. The figuration of the swarm thus [exemplifies
a 'queer necropolitics']{.underline} (Haritaworn, Kuntsman and Posocco,
2014), which builds upon the work of Puar (2007), Reddy (2011) and
others to [analyse gendered, national and racial formations that operate
under logics of sexuality to produce differential worlds of life and
death]{.underline}. Here, understanding ['queer' as
'assemblage]{.underline}' and as a term detached from gay or lesbian
identity, calls attention both to the [formation of a 'terrorist'
subject as queer and as a method of being 'attuned to movements,
intensities, emotions, energies, affectivities and textures as they
inhabit events, spatialities and corporealities']{.underline} (Puar,
2007, p. 215). Puar's appropriation of the Deleuzian term 'assemblage'
(Deleuze and Guattari, 2003 \[1987\]) for her invocation of 'queer
assemblages', is put into productive tension with models of
intersectionality, which presume that the constituent elements in
identity models, such as gender, class, race and sexuality can be
disassembled. Such [methods seek to shed light upon the 'queerness'
already present in the world in terms of exclusions/inclusions,
brutalities and differing regimes of living and dying]{.underline}
(Haritaworn, Kuntsman and Posocco, 2014); at the same time, they also
seek to broaden queer analyses to include ongoing engagements with
shifting identifications, desires, affects and emotions shaping global
politics. [The politics of the swarm can be considered a kind of
'murderous inclusion' or a kind of 'queer necropolitics'. The
figurations of insect and swarm no longer only represent a line of
flight outside of the masculinist politics of control; they are also
currently being appropriated for a necropolitics of surveillance and
warfare.]{.underline} In investigating the 'swarm' in its contemporary
manifestations, I follow Haraway's (1997) conception of the figuration.
Figurations are semiotic tropes combining knowledge, practice and power
that shape the maps of our world and how we understand relations in the
world. 'Figurations are performative images that can be inhabited'
(ibid., p. 11). Figurations, in Cynthia Weber's (2016, p. 28) recent
summary, 'emerge out of discursive and material semiotic assemblages
that condense diffuse imaginaries about the world into specific form or
images that bring specific worlds into being'. Importantly, 'figures
must involve at least some kind of displacement that can trouble
identifications and certainties' (Haraway, 1997, p. 11). Figurations are
thus 'living maps' in Braidotti's terms (2002, p. 2), and are not
totalities but subject to revision and reconfiguration. In [considering
the 'swarm' as a figuration]{.underline}, I take seriously Haraway's
(1991, p. 169) perspective in [which myths and stories about cyborgs,
insects and women are 'sociobiological stories \[that\] depend on a
high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or cybernetic
communications system', and for which 'sex, sexuality and reproduction
are central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our
imaginations of personal and social responsibility']{.underline}. Such
an analysis would require more than a critical feminist reading of the
ways in which sex, gender, sexuality and reproduction are imagined in
cultural products such as literature and film. [Feminist science fiction
can become a 'cyborg story' of recasting 'myths' and technologies in
subversive ways, as neither cyborgs nor swarms are determined by their
origins.]{.underline} At the same time, insects and their collective
life---including the figuration of the 'swarm'---are not only a set of
myths or representations, but [a form of materialisation, most
prominently in military technologies and their practices in
necropolitical forms of death-dealing.]{.underline} In thinking through
science fiction, feminist and otherwise, I want to follow Haraway
(ibid., p. 164) in understanding that 'myth and tool mutually constitute
each other', or what N. Katherine Hayles (1999, p. 47, emphasis in
original) describes as a double vision that 'looks simultaneously at the
power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it' in order
to 'better understand the implication of articulating posthuman
constructions together with embodied actualities'. [Privileging neither
nature nor culture in their ongoing mutual becomings, I want to develop
further the project of relating feminist readings of science fiction to
feminist materialist analyses of becoming-insect, not in the service of
utopian projects but rather to point towards heterotopic worlds of
difference and multiplicity that are up to the task of theorising the
dystopian necropolitical worlds embodied by swarming
drones.]{.underline} In the following exploration of the figuration of
the swarm, particularly its insectoid manifestations, I begin by
discussing its linkages to femininity and 'becoming-woman' and to
racialised forms of life deemed killable. Next, I turn to the ways in
which the figuration of the swarm is inspiring a new generation of
military weaponry that serve as 'technologies of racial distinctions'
(Allinson, 2015). In light of this appropriation of imagery and material
forms associated with femininity and certain forms of feminist politics,
I describe the figuration of the swarm as deeply ambivalent in terms of
its politics of gender, race and sexuality. I then turn to ways in which
insect and swarm imagery are being reimagined in ways that transcend the
contemporary militaristic politics of the swarm.

**The emerging technologies that foreground this topic have transformed
warfare from an exercise of singular sovereign power into a
multiplicity, a swarm, of bio/necro-political sovereignty mobilized in
service of imperial racialized, gendered, and sexual orders.**

[The swarm as a figuration is currently undergoing a material
transformation. Over the past few decades, it has become a
transformative model underpinning military, technological and tactical
innovation. As mentioned previously, the swarm is defined by
self-organising capabilities that are non-linear and depend upon the
adaptive coordination of individual bodies not necessarily commanded by
a sovereign source]{.underline}. Swarming tactics have been part of the
repertoire of war fighting for centuries, if not longer. However, [what
distinguishes emerging military manifestations of the swarm from earlier
ones, is their composition as configurations of humans, technological
artefacts and various artificial intelligence capacities]{.underline}.
The development of [these swarm assemblages is driven in part by the
perception of a changing threat environment for the US and other
advanced industrial states---of threats that stem not only from
conventional state military forces or nuclear weapons but also from more
mobile and unpredictable elements.]{.underline} As they are more
adaptable and fluid, based on biological models rather than on the
static model of a network (Scharre, 2014), swarms are seen as an evolved
stage of networked warfare. The idea behind the drive to harness the
material capabilities of the swarm is that bees, ants and such are not
individually intelligent, but can exhibit much more complex behaviour
collectively. In laboratories and bases, the US, UK and other militaries
are developing what the US military has called 'SWARM capability', or
'Smart Warfighting Array of Reconfigurable Modules'. A key advantage
this swarm intelligence is thought to enable is the ability for an
entire swarm to be controlled or directed by a single operator rather
than a vast network[. The ability to adapt and communicate in real time,
beyond the ability of humans to process and respond, is also see an
advantage of swarm intelligence]{.underline}. The vision of the drone
itself, in its most famous manifestation as 'Predator' or 'Reaper', can
be seen as a kind of insect vision; the multiple lenses in the drone
swarm are able to provide greater 'situational awareness' and monitor
the environment from many different angles (see Chamayou, 2015, p. 38).
Another foreseen advantage of the technological swarm is that it will
not be affected by losses and casualties in the same way that human
combatants are (Hambling, 2015, p. 183). In its LOCUST programme, the US
Navy is working to develop low-cost swarming drone technology that would
enable the formation flight of thirty drones without having to be
individually controlled (ibid., pp. 189--190). To develop these
capacities, many different kinds of 'microdrones' are being developed
(see also Bumiller and Shanker, 2011; Thielman, 2015). Inspired by
nature's ability to create small-scale flying machines, these many kinds
of 'insect cyborgs' are primarily being developed to provide
surveillance: they are to be mobile 'bugs'. Scientist Vijay Kumar at the
University of Pennsylvania, for example, studies insects to learn
principles upon which ants divide labour to perform different tasks, in
order to some day apply these principles to program a fleet of aerial
robots to interact with each other towards a common goal (Conner, 2014).
Rosi Braidotti (2013, p. 124) describes [a 'techno-beastiary' of
military developments]{.underline}, such as 5 kg 'Sand Fleas' that can
leap through windows or off of 30-metre ledges while stabilising and
filming; six-legged robo-cockroaches that can climb walls; and the
DelFly, a dragonfly-shaped surveillance drone with a camera weighing
only a few grams. Some 'insect-cyborgs' are not technological
reproductions of insect life, but modifications of insects themselves:
the 'Beetle Commander' is a wired-up flower beetle controlled by signals
sent to its brain via a backpack containing a radio receiver, battery
and custom-built signal board connected to electrodes in the Beetle's
brain (Anthes, 2013).Footnote4 The UK government's Ministry of Defence
has also recently announced a funding competition for the development of
technologies that would enable a single operator to control drone swarms
consisting of over twenty components (Innovate London, 2016). The US is
adapting its popular F-16 fighter jet, to allow a pilot to operate
unmanned vehicles alongside it, as well as to deploy a swarm of drones
(Axe, 2016). [The capacities of insect life and the relations of the
swarm are clearly no longer only a source of threat and danger, but a
means by which that perceived threat is contained. The swarm as
represented in a figuration linking it to 'becoming-woman' poses a
threat to the political ontology of the 'body politics', and thus to
political order. The biological swarm, the technological network and the
political multitude are variations of an ambivalent negotiation of a
political body that bears a similarly ambivalent relationship with
sovereignty]{.underline} (Thacker, 2004a, 2004b). The agency of the
swarm is unclear; according to studies of animal behaviour going back to
the nineteenth century (Thacker, 2004a), it emerges out of interactions
between individuals, in response to environmental constraints, and
within groups. But now [multiplicity is also used on behalf of sovereign
power and necropower]{.underline}. While Hardt and Negri (2003, pp.
91--92) celebrate the swarm as a network of a multitude of different
creative agents solving problems without centralised control, the mere
existence of a network does not necessarily make it more democratic. As
Galloway and Thacker (2007) have argued, some swarms are compatible with
centralised control; that is, swarms may be controlled or directed, or
[a swarm can be used for the purpose of control itself]{.underline} (see
also Coeckelbergh, 2011). The swarm [occupies an ambiguous
categorisation between the 'many' and the 'one' in terms of individual
independence and collective coordination.]{.underline} This figure of
the 'swarm' has much in common with Lauro and Embry's (2008)
articulation of the 'zombie', in its indeterminate status between living
and dead and in its posthuman consciousness that obliterates the
distinction between subject and object. [The inspiration and development
of 'drone swarms' is reminiscent of the creation of the feminine
automaton: a machine created in a feminine body designed to do men's
bidding]{.underline}, such as in Metropolis (1927) or Ex Machina (2015).
A key critique of automated drones guided by artificial intelligence,
including drone swarms, is the potential or anticipated loss of human
control over technologies of death. Part of the fear here, [in alleged
loss of humanity in warfare, is better theorised as the loss of an ideal
of humanity associated with a certain form of masculinity: namely, the
possessive liberal individual, whose agency is secured in a conscious
mind]{.underline} (Hayles, 2005, p. 177, 1999). In her work My Mother
Was a Computer (2005), N. Katherine Hayles notes [the persistence of
gendered representations of artificial intelligence, in which a male
creator exacts his will through the use of female automata]{.underline}
(female bodies controlled by another agent) [against other men. This
cultural trope is being realised in the creation of 'drone swarms':
mechanical creations made to mimic insect and other forms of swarming
life in the service of militaristic ends. More to the point, it seeks to
harness the feminised power of the swarm for its own ends.]{.underline}
As such, [the swarm is now not only a metaphor but also a central mode
of biopolitical and necropolitical life]{.underline}. Michel Foucault's
(2007 \[1978\], pp. 21--22) biopolitical analysis of the e[mergence of
different modalities of power revolves around a relationship with
certain non-human forms of life/deat]{.underline}h in the form of
disease-causing microbes and viruses---from the sovereign exclusion of
infected bodies of leprosy, to the discipline and surveillance of the
plague, to the regulation of different kinds of circulations of people
and non-human objects in the 'milieu'. Our contemporary biopolitical
analysis requires an analysis of the politics of life and death in th[e
insect and the swarm]{.underline}, which, following Braidotti (2002),
[cannot be assumed to be a mere metaphor or representation for political
life, but an animating materialist logic.]{.underline} The issue of the
swarm that defies categorisation between the one and the many, of which
sovereignty depends, is a central problem for political organisation. As
Eugene Thacker (2011, p. 154, emphasis in original) writes, 'In the
"problem of multiplicities" presented to the body politic concept by
plague, pestilence, and epidemic, [multiplicity is never separate from,
and is always inculcated within, the problem of sovereignty ... it is
multiplicity that plagues the body politic'.]{.underline} Much of the
debate about drone warfare has focussed on the prospect of 'killer
robots' being deployed and of the lack of human control over the
sovereign power of killing. [Defenders of the use of artificial
intelligence and automated targeting point to their benefits, such as
the removal of emotion and human error]{.underline} that can result in
increased deaths of civilians (among others, see Strawser, 2010; Byman,
2013; Lewis, 2013). Regardless of the merits of such arguments, [the
drone and increasingly drone swarm tactics constitute the terrain of war
and the subjects who both wage and suffer from war]{.underline}. Eyal
Weizman (2011) notes that the swarm plays a key role in the tactics of
Israeli ground forces. Achille Mbembe (2003, p. 40, emphasis in the
original) writes, 'in [our contemporary world, weapons are deployed in
the interest of maximum destruction of persons and the creation of
death-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast
populations are subjected to conditions of life conferring upon them the
status of living dead'.]{.underline} Mbembe's thesis amends Foucault's
biopolitical concept and formulates contemporary politics as not only
biopolitical but also necropolitical. The lines between war and politics
are blurred as they are in biopolitics; however, according to Mbembe,
power does not only 'make life live' but also creates certain categories
of the 'living dead' as those always-already dead, and thus subject to
massacre. In nineteenth- and early twentieth-century social evolutionary
theory, studies of insects played a key role in naturalising racial and
colonial hierarchies. Such work often read colonialism and slavery as
present in insect 'societies' and classified certain insect societies as
more or less like humans. 'The social construction of insect sociality
was premised on colonial views of what defined civilization as the
"highest" and all others as "lower" in the social scale' (Rodgers, 2008,
p. 139). While 'drone' as a colloquialism comes from its ethological use
as a term signifying zombie-like non-cognition, the place of the insect
between life and death takes on new meaning in contemporary global
violence. [The militarised techno-swarms created on behalf of a project
of biopolitical warfare with the ability to fight war without risk of
death to human subjects on one side, also create entire populations who
'li\[v\]e under drones']{.underline}, in which the 'buzzing' sound of
drone is a source of anxiety and fear. One member of a community in
Pakistan affected by drones described the effect of hearing them buzzing
overhead as spreading a 'wave of terror' over the community: 'Children,
grown-up people, women, they are terrified ... they scream in terror'
(International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic and Global
Justice Clinic, 2012). [As an apparatus that decides whose life is
worthy of living and who is to be put to death]{.underline}, Allinson
(2015, p. 120) describes [the drone as 'a technology of racial
distinction'.]{.underline} Its development and usage are part of a
[reconstitution of the theater of war as a frontier zone of American
empire,]{.underline} a process that has, in Feldman's (2011, p. 329)
words, '[contorted the temporality of warfare through notions of
preemption and endurance, recalibrated Orientalist imagined geography
through far more porous concepts of proximity that challenge received
notions of state territoriality and national borders, and fixated on the
mystique of "precision targeting" in highly ambiguous structures of race
and space']{.underline}. The [description of people killed by drones as
'bug splats' in military slang further signifies the dehumanisation and
abjectification of those killed by drones, whether targeted or
accidentally killed]{.underline}.Footnote5 In these instances,
[figurations of the swarm are used as instruments of sovereign power to
kill and manage other populations figured as inhuman 'swarms'. The
threat of terrorism is figured as the threat of the multitude, of the
swarm, of the concerted action of that which does not necessarily have a
single head.]{.underline} US (former) Coordinator for Counterterrorism
Cofer Black (2003) claimed 'the threat of international terrorism knows
no boundaries'. The threat of terrorism is often represented as
boundless and formless. The purported formlessness of such loosely
connected organisations is partly due to the transnational organisation
of various 'terrorist groups'; combined with their tendency to make use
of territories beyond the reach of the administrative power of various
states, this means that the contemporary figure of the 'terrorist' is
dangerous in part because of his (or increasingly, her) lack of
subjectification within the terms of state power and state identity.
While marked by difference in this way, 'terrorist' figurations are also
able to hide this difference. The terrorist, like the communist or
homosexual, could be anybody---hiding in a 'sleeper cell' or blending in
with the population with various forms of deception, such as shaving
their beard. Al-Qaeda in particular has been conceptualised as a
network---or, more specifically, as individuals who become
radicalised---acting in the name of Al-Qaeda with no other formal
affiliation. It is a collective that acts without a hierarchy. In this
sense, [the 'enemy' is represented in insect ways as well. In the shift
to war technologies and tactics inspired by insect swarms, we may be
seeing a final admission that traditional modes of warfare are not
always able to control non-hierarchical, feminine/queer and networked
space]{.underline}s.Footnote6 The figuration of the 'swarm' has also
been applied to refugee and migrant populations, most famously by former
UK Prime Minister David Cameron (see BBC News, 2015); rhetorically
figured as swarms, refugees threaten to overwhelm like a plague of
locusts. Even without using the specific language of the swarm, refugees
have been depicted as reproducing uncontrollably and, in turn,
threatening to overwhelm, disturb order and defy boundaries. This is a
common figuration of the masses, multitudes, rioters, etc., which falls
back onto the monstrous as threatening other. Yet, unlike these feminine
creations, the entire purpose of the techno-swarm is that they are not
controlled or controllable by man: ['Swarms may not be predictable to
the enemy, but neither are they exactly controllable or predictable for
the side using them,]{.underline} which can lead to unexpected results
[... a swarm takes action in its own']{.underline} (Singer, 2009, p.
110). The unpredictability of the swarm is at once [its greatest promise
and its peril.]{.underline}

**The politics of the swarm subsumes queerness by incorporating its
subjective divergence into the US military arsenal -- to understand
contemporary militarism we must first analyze the murderous inclusion of
queer radicality in the state assemblage of necropolitics.**

Insect life and the swarm remain deeply ambivalent figurations. As noted
in the feminist works of utopian and speculative fiction discussed
earlier in this text, [the insect and particularly the collective insect
life of the swarm have been claimed by some feminists as a positive mode
of being to emulate]{.underline}, in distinction to the characterisation
of women-as-insect as alien monster. However, Jinathana Haritaworn
(2015) has recently questioned the celebratory nature of queer
scholarship taking up monstrosity, animality and morbidity as objects of
regeneration and nostalgia, particularly when 'queer' intersects with
racialisation and the necropolitical[. The current wave of militarising
the swarm suggests the need for a similarly cautious approach when
teasing out the implications of insect/swarm figurations. The symbolic
ambiguity of the drone swarm can starkly be observed]{.underline} in the
2017 application of drone swarms flying in formation to create the image
of an American flag at that most patriotic of US sporting events, the
Super Bowl. This was carried out at the end of a performance by Lady
Gaga, known for her legions of queer fans (affectionately called 'Little
Monsters') and queer-friendly anthems such as 'Born this way' (2011)
(see Figure 1). To facilitate interrogation of the ways in which [the
figuration of the insect or swarm becomes ambivalent in light of the
militaristic 'drone swarm,' we can consider the limitations of
evolutionary modes of reproduction]{.underline}. Gilman's (2015
\[1915\]) utopian story of female equality and peacefulness portrays
insect life as a positive model of society that becomes subject to the
unfair prejudice and incomprehension of male (and, importantly, imperial
and capitalist) superiority[. Whether insect life presents a utopian or
dystopian model depends on one's gendered subjectivity,]{.underline} but
it is clearly presented both as an ideal and one that is possible in the
absence of men. However, Herland is limited for thinking about [our
contemporary technological worlds, in which life is folded into 'code'
as means of reproduction and communications]{.underline}. Herland's mode
of reproduction is largely Darwinistic rather than involving the
reassembly of code (see also Haraway, 1991, 1997). Also, as in Perkins'
political works, the [utopian elements of the society rely on social
evolutionary theory based on contemporary ethology to insist on the
superiority of female-led societies]{.underline} (as does Tiptree's
story of insect-like women reproducing by cloning in Houston, Houston,
Do You Read?). This cannot speak to the posthuman condition of the
drone-swarm assemblage that incorporates what Hayles (2006, p. 160)
refers to as the 'cognisphere', or the 'distributed cultural cognitions
embodied both in people and their technologies'. In other words, [models
of reproduction that rely upon Darwinistic or sexual reproduction are
incompatible with the ways in which technologies of both reproduction
and death-dealing are based on code and increasingly artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. [The figuration of the cyborg is germinal but
insufficient for theorising the complexities of the posthuman figuration
of the 'swarm', which characterises the human/animal/technological
matrix of swarming drones, and the distributed cognitive capacities on
which it depends]{.underline}. This shift can be seen in the contrast
between different versions of The Fly. David Cronenburg's 1986 remake of
The Fly (1986) stars Geena Davis as plucky investigative journalist
Veronica, in lieu of the 1958 version's accommodating housewife, and
Jeff Goldblum as secretive scientist Seth Brundle who turns
'Brundlefly'. Cronenburg's version represents the bodily horror of
'becoming-insect' in different and significant ways to Neumann's
version. Goldblum's character does not transform into two separate
human/fly hybrids. Instead, in keeping with a contemporary emphasis on
the powers and peril of DNA as the 'code' of life, Seth and the fly
merge into a single being when a circuit infects Seth through a wound in
his back, obtained while having sex with Veronica. Rather than
experience an instantaneous break, Seth becomes a monstrous figure
caught in a state of transformation---of 'becoming-fly'---which,
initially at least, seems to give him 'better than human' powers. In
this mode of becoming, traditional reproduction and phallocentric power
become as irrelevant and detachable as the Brundlefly's penis (even if
this change was instigated during heterosexual sex). The transformation
into the alien, feminine 'other' does not, at least for a time, prove
threatening. For Braidotti (2002, p. 124), this version of The Fly
represents Deleuze and Guattari's 'becoming-animal' as 'a way of
scrambling the master-code of phallocentrism and loosening its power
over the body'. Braidotti's (ibid., p. 169) notion of 'becoming-insect'
is about a materialist becoming, outside of the human; however, this
does not erase sexual difference, but rather displaces it. In a related
fashion, Elizabeth Grosz (1995), inspired by Caillois' theories of
insects, theorises sex and the politics of sexual difference as an open
mode of becoming situated outside of heteronormative reproductive sex
(Parikka, 2010), and which can be described as 'queer' insofar as desire
becomes about opening oneself to new encounters, new bodies, new
affects. As [the swarm relies on modes of communication and reproduction
outside of evolutionary and heteronormative frames, the use of such
forms of communication and reproduction in 'swarm' warfare participates
in a kind of 'murderous inclusion' (]{.underline}Haritaworn, Kuntsman
and Posocco, 2014) [and normalisation of queer subjects and
bodies.]{.underline} A related development is the [increasing ability
for women, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people to serve openly
in the US military. The increased reliance on drones in the US, and
increasingly around the world]{.underline},Footnote7 notably [signals a
change in the relationship between the military and
masculinity]{.underline}. This is at least at [the forefront of
technology and war, with traditional military values associated with
masculinity, such as physical strength and courage under fire, becoming
less relevant to operational success]{.underline} (for example, see
Bayard de Volo, 2016). One source suggests that 17 per cent of those
assigned to drone activities at Creech Air Force Base are female, which
is greater than the overall percentage of women serving in the US
military (Manjikian, 2014). Today, the US military is more inclusive
than ever in terms of gender and sexuality; since 2011, with the
official repeal of the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, it has allowed
gays and lesbians to serve openly, and it is also in a contested process
of opening up combat positions to women. On 30 June 2016, the US
military also overturned its ban on transgender people serving in the
military, and it is now required to provide transgender personnel with
relevant medical care. In these ways, [the military can be said to have
shifted]{.underline} from a site of patriarchal values and homophobia to
a nominally 'ungendered' site where women can be 'honorary men' (King,
2016), and [to a site of homonationalism]{.underline} (Puar, 2007) t[hat
situates the US as a site of exceptional sexual tolerance in opposition
to representations of Arab/Muslim sexuality as barbaric and
perverse.]{.underline} One example of this form of 'murderous inclusion'
can been seen in the The Daily Beast's reporting of a female drone
pilot, nicknamed 'Sparkle' because of her bedazzled headset. Explaining
her decorative choice, Sparkle reproduces the gendered, racialised logic
that women need protection from Arab/Muslim men: 'I use it to emasculate
the enemy in the afterlife. \[...\] Considering how they treat their
women, I'm OK with rubbing salt in the wound' (Maurer, 2015). Here we
see [an example of a symbol of femininity---the frivolous and
'sparkly'---put into the service of a racialised necropolitics of
high-tech death-dealing against dehumanised others, much in the way that
the figuration of the insect/swarm has been. We see the drone swarm as a
form of queer necropolitics that incorporates queer bodies and queer
modes of signification into assemblages of racialised death-dealing;
however, this does not exhaust the possibilities for the politics of the
swarm.]{.underline}

CONCLUSION

In their analyses of queer migration and queer diaspora, queer
migrations scholars demonstrate how [any attempt to posit home and
homeland as **secure** ontological places is **confounded by
encounters** with movement and **queerness** inside the
home/land]{.underline} (Eng 1997; Ahmed 2000; Fortier 2001; 2003;
Luibhéid 2002; 2008; 2013; Luibhéid and Cantú 2005; Luibhéid,
Buffington, and Guy 2014). As this chapter demonstrates, their
conclusion is as true in IR as it is in queer migration studies. For the
(sometimes) [queer movements of the 'unwanted im/migrant' and the
'al-Qaeda terrorist'---as civilizational and sexual development on the
move and as civilizational and sexual barbarism on the move---occur
across, between, and within heteronormatively understood homes,
homelands, and sexualities in ways that expose these foundational sites
of national/civilizational reproduction as **irregular, indeterminate,
and transposable**.]{.underline}

Western responses to these irregularities---to these intricately
produced anarchies---are rooted as much in the desires of Western
populations for ease in the homeland as they are in their desires for
ease in the home. This is why Western (post)developmental (Bigo 2002)
and security narratives reoppose to the 'Islamic civilizational family'
their figuration of the 'Western civilizational family' as the
foundation of national/civilizational sovereignties. This is why these
discourses contrast the properly patriotic and cultural attachments to
nation, culture, and home/land of the 'Western civilizational family'
with the improper attachments of the 'Islamic family' to nation,
culture, and home/land (Puar and Rai 2002; Puar 2007). And [this is how
these discourses fix the 'unwanted im/migrant' and the 'al-Qaeda
terrorist' as the necessary civilizationally and **sexually perverse
figures** who are called upon to normalize Western individual, familial,
and national/civilizational figures and attachments to 'civilized,
developed sovereign man' and the sovereign orders he authorizes as
rational, reasonable, and just.]{.underline}

These 'homing desires' (Brah 1996, 187)---these desires 'to feel at home
achieved by physically or symbolically (re)constituting spaces which
provide some kind of ontological security in the context of migration'
(Fortier 2000, 163)---are usually understood to be the desires of
im/migrating or diasporic subjects. What this analysis suggests is that
the civilizational and sexual movements of figures like the 'unwanted
im/migrant' and the 'al-Qaeda terrorist' implant homing desires in
Western subjects. [These homing desires take practical form in Western
(post)developmental and security discourses that attempt and fail to
'manage unease' in the homeland (Bigo 2002) and also in the home by
figuring a Western 'civilized, developed sovereign man' as the manager
of their unease by being the manager of their security.]{.underline} In
so doing, they expose the 'anxious labor' (Luibhéid 2008, 174) Western
discourses expend to create binary sexual figurations of and in the home
and homeland that might sustain heteronormative sexualized orders of
international relations (also see Peterson 1999).

Chapters 3 and 4 on the 'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the
'unwanted im/migrant', and the 'terrorist', considered together, suggest
that these 'homing desires' have long been a feature of how Western
heteronormativities put sex into discourse in intimate, national, and
international relations. The tropes of home and homeland participate in
creating these four figurations of the 'perverse homosexual' as the
primary performativities that (post)colonial subjects can inhabit. These
tropes tie the 'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the 'unwanted
im/migrant', and the 'terrorist' to specific places, times, and desires
that establish specific figures---the normal sovereign versus the
perverse antisovereign---who guarantee various either/or
anarchy-versus-order binaries as perverse-versus-normal binaries. And
these tropes mobilize these binaries to create specific (albeit
unreliable) mappings of the world to contain the movements of these
'dangerous figures' in that world, which no amount of determined work
can contain geopolitically or sexually. [In all of these ways, then,
heteronormative Western **discourses script the 'underdeveloped', the
'undevelopable'**, the 'unwanted im/migrant', and the 'terrorist' **as
'perverse homosexuals'** who are foundational to traditional either/or
Western logics of statecraft as mancraft and Western sexual
organizations of international relations.]{.underline}

What we will see in chapter 5 is how this freighted labor is mobilized
again, this time through homonormativities, in ways that both reply upon
and disavow figurations of the 'perverse homosexual' in order to birth a
very specific figuration of the 'normal homosexual'.

up the hacking allegations during the 2016 election, showing a

Other satirical half-naked versions of Putin appeared on Colbert's Late

passionately on 16 November 2016; and Beck Bennett regularly takes off
his shirt to impersonate the Russian president in season 42 of NBC's

committing morally corrupt or illegal acts, and influencing the US
president, [suggests that Putin is a **threat** to liberal and
democratic values]{.underline}. His exagge[rated masculinity mocks Putin
and underlines the threat of amorality and corruption to a point where
toxic masculinity, amorality and corruption become
**inseparable**]{.underline}. Of course, political satire is not the
same as political commentary, and allows for a multitude of readings,
including ironic interpretations. However, the focus on the figure of
Putin and its frequency within a range of diverse media support the idea
that he poses a threat to the US, contributing to an increase in
anti-Russian sentiments. Today, '\[[m\]ore than half of Americans
believe Russia poses a critical threat to the United States' and 'a
record-high 73 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of
Russia']{.underline} (Lardieri, 2019) according to recent polls.
Furthermore, '\[d\]emocrats are more likely to view the country's power
as a critical threat to the U.S. than Republicans -- 65 percent compared
to 46 percent' (ibid.). Focusing on president Putin rather than on the
Russian government, state or nation, and [connecting his performance of
masculinity to the ascription of power]{.underline}, US online media and
(print) [magazines thereby reinforce what Nelson calls
'**presidentialism'**]{.underline} (2008). The logic of presidentialism
[**shapes** citizen's ideas and feelings about the US president as well
as democratic practices]{.underline}. '[Unexamined, these trained
feelings can **pull**]{.underline} \[[citizens\] in powerfully anti
democratic directions']{.underline} (Nelson, 2008, p. 5). Nelson argues
that [presidentialism can **limit citizens' agency** in moments of
'legitimate and pressing questions about the democratic
ethics]{.underline} of presidential behavior or about the devaluation of
citizen power within \[the\] government. [By keeping \[the\] democratic
hopes oriented toward the **salvific and powerful** \[sitting or
future\] president']{.underline} (ibid.). Arguably, the media's
allocation of seemingly unrestricted presidential power to Putin
confirms the idea that presidents do indeed have such power and that the
sitting US president should have and exercise such power for the benefit
of their citizens. The [emphasis on Putin's white, able, masculine body,
his strong will, and assertiveness suggests that a (**powerful**)
president needs to represent this kind of **white
masculinity**]{.underline}. By juxtaposing Putin and Trump, the images
do not only suggest 'collusion', but they also present Trump as a weak
imposter, and as a puppet of the Russian strongman. Ironically, the idea
that Trump is a weak president, because he allows Putin to influence US
politics, is based on the same ideas about potent white presidential
masculinity that actually led to Trump's election in the first place
(Chira, 2017; Katz, 2016). This idea does not simply support any form of
presidentialism, but, referring to Nelson (2008), calls for a president
who acts as the male hero. Past presidents have often attempted to
create discourses of presidential heroism, national victimization, and
foreign villains themselves. Masculinities studies scholar,
Messerschmidt, shows that both President [Obama and President Bush
portrayed themselves in their speeches as masculine and powerful
men/heroes, capable of protecting the innocent, vulnerable, and needy
from foreign, and often racialized dangers]{.underline}, such as
Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and Saddam Hussein (Messerschmidt, 2016, p. 147).
Although not all of their attempts to fashion themselves as masculine
protectors succeeded, [they were deeply rooted in and evoked
conservative notions of **heterosexual kinship**, with the presidents as
the patriarchal leaders and women and children as the citizens.
Implementing military actions against terrorism, which involved killing
and torture, these presidents further 'reproduce\[d\] and reinforce\[d\]
male dominance/unequal **gender relations** not only in military forces
but also in **society'**]{.underline} (Shen, 2017, p. 139). [Although
Obama continued to promote notions of hegemonic masculinity in
connection with and through military actions, during his presidency the
same hegemonic masculinity became partially challenged and alternative
versions of masculinity have become increasingly normalized within the
sphere of the public. Especially the **gay white man** became
increasingly visible and normalized, along with urban phenomena such as
metrosexuality that allow men to explore markets and body treatments
that were previously seen as strictly feminine]{.underline}. While
hegemonic masculinity seemed to have somewhat receded from view within
US media only a view years ago, [returning the focus to aggressive
masculinities like Putin's in the New Cold War, encourages US Americans
to reembrace **equally aggressive forms** of masculinity within
otherwise liberal political discourses]{.underline}. Within the realm of
popular entertainment, for example in the form of political comedy,
white heterosexual male liberals, such as Alec Baldwin, Beck Bennet, or
Steven Colbert, can now return to center stage at a time when the
dominant presence of white males is contested by people of color, women,
and gender non-conforming people. That is, [when threatened by a white
hyper-masculine enemy, a (white) masculine **heterosexual hero** may
become reinstated for the good of the nation and without any real
resistance. In particular, the comic versions of Putin make it clear
that an explicit compliance to female beauty standards and male 'posing'
are still seen as non-normative and grounds for ridicule]{.underline}.

mirror: Queer becomings with AI", https://doi.org/10.21606/drs.2022.782

2\. Queerness, borderland perspectives for becoming with AI As a
starting point, this paper acknowledges that [queerness is necessarily
**indeterminate**, ambiguous and always in relation, denoting **flexible
spaces** for the expression of all aspects of non, anti, contra,
straight, cultural production and reception]{.underline}. As put by
Sarah Ahmed, \"[queer lives are about the potentiality of not following
certain **conventional scripts**]{.underline}, whereby not following
involves disorientation\" (Ahmed, 2006, p. 189). [To reorientate our
understand- ings of human-AI relations, from the ontological and
**epistemological borderland** of queerness and the gender binary, we
first need some sense of what queerness means, and how it relates
to]{.underline} (design/ing, with, for and through) **[AI
systems]{.underline}**. Queerness as described by José Muñoz in Cruising
Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, can be read as a "horizon
imbued with potentiality", an \"open mesh of possibility", a rejection
of the here and now, and a "basic desire to live otherwise" (Muñoz,
2001, p. 1-2). Always rooted in queer life, struggle and liberation,
queerness "is not yet here... we are not yet queer" (Muñoz, 2009, p.
1-2). Accordingly, [queer futurity, is less about expanding a range of
choices]{.underline} (liberal freedom) [than it is about
**transforming** the kinds of beings we desire to be while embracing the
mutating multitudes and entangled lifeworlds that make up the
pluriverse]{.underline}, or as referred to by the Zapatistas, "un mundo
donde quepan muchos mundos" (a world where many worlds fit) (Escobar,
2016, p. 42). In [considering queer becomings with AI, we cross a
threshold, intentionally getting lost in the borderlands of
possibility]{.underline}, what Gloria Anzaldúa proposes as a psychic,
social, and cultural terrain that we inhabit and that inhabits all of us
(Anzaldúa, 1987), by which they mean a terrain where we encounter the
world differently; losing our way to find our way (Ahmed, 2006).
Importantly, [this place of uncertainty is not a weakness but a **power
to be explored**]{.underline} (Preciado, 2021). In this way, [queerness
is just as much about playing with the kinds of beings we desire to be
as much as it is about offering a **critique** of the cultural,
sociotechnical systems that shape our **becoming with AI**]{.underline}.
[To the **binary logic of AI**, differently situated
knowledge]{.underline}(s) and other/ed perspectives, [are
**destabilising**, thus demonstrating that binaries, be they imagined,
cultural or technological are not natural nor always
necessary]{.underline}. Rather, the notion of [queerness speaks to a
politics of transitivity]{.underline}---relating to, or [characterised
by, transition, bringing into question modes of gendered embodiment
within all humans and non-humans and their configurations]{.underline}
(Halberstam, 2016, 2017). In this sense, [a queering of AI is a proposal
to **unsettle western thought**, including the dominant
**techno-deterministic**, cultural fictions, **social imaginaries** and
**technical propositions** that shape how we create for, through, and
with AI relations]{.underline} (Revell et al 2021, p. 57). [Calling for
new postures or rather, "queer turnings]{.underline}," (Ahmed, 2006)
[towards AI, may help shift how we relate to, and **move with AI
differently**]{.underline}. Mutations arising through queerness [offer
designers a borderland perspective to decode, indeed, to
**deterritorialise** AI\'s fixed binary historical understandings and
how it is **deployed** within everyday life]{.underline} (Deleuze &
Guattari, 2005, p. 69). My point of departure, then, is to think about
mutations as a means of unsettling common understandings of or postures
towards AI today. This, I hope, will offer designers a mode of leaning
into performativity, improvisation and uncertainty in their dealings
with AI and the "mutable and the immutable features of our existence"
(Levitas, 2013. p. 137). 3. Experiments and speculations on queer
becomings with AI In the following section, drawing particular
inspiration from Paul B Preciado\'s Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and
Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era, I present an
autotheoretical experiment and provocation centred on queerness. With
this, I seek to problematise notions of normativity and the
naturalisation reproduced in and through AI systems (Bell et al., 2022).
It can also be read as a gesture of resistance, a means to rethink
encoded meaning beyond binary hegemonic, heteronormative classification
schemes, categorisation, and modes of production. It is, as Preciado
(2013) has described, "a body-essay" -- a kind of soma-technological
fiction relating to self-experimentation (Preciado, 2013, p. 7), or a
queer reading into the possibilities of becoming oneself, finding one's
body "through becoming, embodying, a glitch" (Russell, 2020. p 151). The
experiment which I will introduce here as Mutant in the Mirror engages
with the notion of queering AI by tinkering with an AI system that
identifies patterns, abstract meaning and signification, classifies,
categorises and creates. Along these lines, I return to the questions:
[What if we understood AI as queer, a kind of mutant, in **a state of
becoming**; a dynamic, relational, non-binary gender variant, how then
might AI show up in and act on the world (with us humans)
differently?]{.underline} Mutant in the Mirror uses a readily available
AI platform, in this case, one that uses StyleGANs, a class of deep
learning generative and predictive modelling in which two neural
networks compete by discriminating between real and fake data in order
to become more accurate in their predictions. In this way, the StyleGAN
model performs as a vehicle to grapple and play with the idea of
mutations arising through AI and further queer becomings with AI. As
such, the experiment itself is not reliant on the technical capacity or
limitations of the platform as it is. I start my inquiry by considering
how embodied subjects are constituted (subjected and subjugated) through
configurations and delegations, intended or unintended, that shape
potentialities emerging from the co-performative, intra-actions a user
might have with an AI system. Accordingly, following Helga Nowotny's
(2021) claim that [the power of AI is performative, playing with the
idea of performative power, noticing ways "an algorithm has the
capability to **make happen what it predicts** when human behaviour
**follows** the prediction]{.underline}" (Nowotny, 2021, p. 19). [Here
the notion of performativity, **originating through certain speech**
acts that pronounce and affect the world can be understood as
performative action]{.underline} (Butler, 2002), [where action
originates through recursive feedback loops of material and discursive
practices]{.underline}. As it intersects with the performative, the 'co'
used here recognises the agency of both the user and the AI system in
producing action, where their becoming is mutually dependent on their
intra-actions (Barad, 2003). By way of a methodological grounding, I
borrow from what Lauran Fournier (2021) has called 'autotheory,' used to
describe a reflexive praxis that blurs the boundaries between living,
making, and theorising (Fournier, 2021). I couple it with speculative
research (Wilkie et al. 2017). While all research is subjective in the
sense that the researcher\'s perspective cannot be uncoupled from the
research process, autotheory places the researcher\'s \'self\' at the
centre of inquiry, always in situated relation to the subject and theory
being studied. In this sense, by placing myself within the experiment, I
gain a more textured insight into AI, through my own queer experience,
dialoguing with queer theory as a means to reflect on the felt,
imagined-but-not-yet-real (im)possibilities of AI signaling in the
present. Moreover, the experiment in itself is an act of
co-performative, theatrical modelling---an ontological reflexive inquiry
into the relational, recursive, emergent and exploratory production of
fictive becomings with AI, crafted through performative action (Christy,
2017). Through this selfexperimentation process1 , I hope to gain
insight into the queer borderland relational aspects of the constituted
self, mutating, becomings through co-performative intra-actions with AI.
3.1 The crossing, mutant in the mirror I titled this ongoing experiment
as the Mutant in the Mirror for the obvious reason that my
self-reflexive experience of observing the images documented in Figure 1
quite literally feels like staring into a mirror, with mutants staring
back at me. The potential variations of myself function as possibilities
of myself, a uniquely queer skin anticipating changes to my
cyberidentity. It asks, do I present as ambiguous? I am a body in
mutation? It is my intention. Figure 1 presents some of the mutating
synthetic image data produced through the experiment. The images act as
a discursive device used to evoke reflections on the kind of queer,
mutating becomings with AI discussed in this text. Generating multiple
mutant images and synthetic data through the StyleGAN model provided me
with a space to play with my own indeterminacy, fluid boundaries,
(dis)identifiability and resistance to classification and
categorisation. The particular model used in this experiment was trained
using a small personal dataset of 70 images of myself across different
places in time, some passing more feminine and some as more masculine.
Also included in the training dataset were images of other humans
(grandmother, mother, etc.), and non-humans (dog, places, etc.) that
shape my sense of time, self and world. The 3000+ image(s) and video(s)
generated through the experiment function as a mirror, through which I
get lost, disoriented and reoriented, turning differently towards
myself, my body, my corporal and subjective experience of the world. In
this way, the Mutant in the Mirror comes to function as both a looking
glass and a crystal ball, surfacing (speculations of) alternative
versions of myself---mutating---becoming with AI. What started as an
experiment in reimagining the notion of \"fixed labels, fluid
complexity\" concerning who decides how we are read in the world,
challenging deterministic binary modes of classification and
categorisation (Crawford, 2021), concludes as an exploration into a
metaphysics of interconnectedness (Anzaldúa, 2015). Indeed, a reflection
on what (queer) intraactions with AI systems might tell us about
ourselves when we co-perform with them. So what did the experiment tell
me about myself? Am I a woman or a man? A subject or an object?
Corporeal or incorporeal? Or, am I something in-between or outside of
these dichotomies? Am I hairspray? Or am I a toy poodle? (see figure 2)
Design's current instantiations and orientations towards AI tend towards
inscribing binary classifications, engendering human and non-human
bodies and experiences---resulting in the misclassification or erasure
of nonbinary or trans bodies and experiences via cultural
(sociotechnical) classification systems encoded with homonormative
(masculine) logic and meaning (Bell & Broad et al., 2021; Keyes 2018).
The Mutant in the Mirror calls the binarization of AI into question,
offering a glimpse into designing interventions for refusal to
\'perform\' in a way that was prescribed as much as it provides openings
for imagining and enacting the world in unpredictable ways while
reaching more diverse probabilistic outcomes. The classification
presented in Figure 2, with a high probability that I am hairspray and a
low probability that I am lipstick, suggests that the mutable self is
reducible to a set of categorical signifiers when in reality data is
textural and culturally rich. By playing with AI systems that at once
negotiate deterministic and probabilistic outcomes---while neatly
classifying and categorising people---one could quickly grasp that this
is an area that requires critical design review. As everyday life
practices increasingly rely on AI systems, what is at stake are our
computational sovereignty (Bratton, 2016) and our ability to imagine and
enact different realities as self-determining subjects (Parisi, 2019;
O\'Shea, 2021), individually or collectively. It is not evident how the
classifications depicted in Figure 2 came about. However, through the
experiment, it becomes clear that, to paraphrase James Bridle, we
(designers) must find ways to deal with an incomputable world while
acknowledging that it is irrevocably shaped and informed by computation.
Recognising that AI systems are encoded, and thus can be decoded and
re-written, allows for a different kind of logic and meaning to take
root. Such a rewriting of AI may challenge how the self can be
interpreted and labelled by and through AI systems in its open-ended
becoming. Upon reflection on the experiment, I am reminded by Muñoz's
(1999) proposal that we view identification as code, a raw material that
can be cracked open and reconfigured. This experiment opens doors to
rethinking categorical signification, challenging the notion of
categories and classification under its current deployments within and
by AI systems. In this way, (dis)identification can be seen as a
possible avenue for designers to engage with the incommensurate, that
which resists fixed definition or measurement. Or otherwise put,
disidentification and the failings to read by computational systems may
present opportunities to negotiate calculative reasoning, the fine line
between incomputability, and cultural computability of AI in more
imaginative ways. Along these lines, mutations, rebelling against
classification (Preciado, 2021), can be seen to make space for
representation and empowerment of minority identities, identifications
and positionalities rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture,
whereby the potential for computational sovereignty and digital
self-determination can be realised. Moreover, as an act of refusal, the
mutant starts a conversation with us about AI predictions, categories
and classifications. It testifies that AI needs not be deterministic in
moving to a singular final destination; it must not assume that how we
are read must be chosen for us, as if we were singular and not plural,
static and unchangeable. [The mutant demonstrates the **dynamic nature**
of becoming through relation. The mutant **moves and mutates with me**.
In a mutually affecting mutation, we become **grammatically incorrect**
singular, plural, by co-performing, intra-acting together, gesturing
towards moving in concert, alongside, mutating together. Who is the
mutant in the mirror staring back at us? Do we know them? **How** do we
move through and act on the world with them]{.underline}? 4. Gestures of
resistance, for designers becoming with AI Mutant in the mirror
acknowledges that we live in times of digital transformation, yet design
practice is ill-equipped to proactively and responsibly deal with such
change. Consequently, designing for, with, and through emerging AI
systems require new design vocabularies, narratives and requirements
adept at negotiating complex human and artificial relations. As such,
the Mutant in the Mirror experiment finds particular relevance within
the emerging field of AI, HCI and designs' critical engagement with AI
in theory and practice. [As we become reoriented towards
AI]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} (designers) [must begin to engage with
AI as something that is **not neutral** nor outside us]{.underline}. It
is a part of our daily life, [mutating the **heterogeneity of systems**,
sentient beings, others' bodies, their **agencies** and affective powers
to make the world]{.underline}. Modes of knowing and unknowing under the
rubric of mutations compel us to reflect on ways different entities do
not merely interact with each other, but rather, define each other
through their intra-action (Barad, 2003). In his lecture at the École de
la Cause Freudienne annual conference, Preciado posed a question to the
3,500 Psychoanalysts in attendance: "Can the Monster Speak?" By asking
this question, and while reflecting on his own experiences of
transitioning and embodied mutation, Preciado invited those in
attendance to consider a new epistemology capable of "allowing for a
multiplicity of living bodies without reducing the body to its sole
heterosexual reproductive capability and without legitimising
hetero-patriarchal and colonial violence" (Preciado, 2021). [Through a
**reoriented epistemology of bodies**, human and nonhuman, new
possibilities may emerge for humanity to present otherwise, where
"pregnant androids and clone sister-mothers can be read as queer and
**trans algorithms of kinship**]{.underline}" (Cárdenas, 2018). As
fantastic as it may seem, the kinship articulated by Cárdenas offers
glimpses into the cultural fictions, social imaginaries and technical
propositions stemming from such epistemological reorientations as
proposed by Preciado, where [bodies might be grounded in relational
plurality]{.underline}. In other words, the [mutant becomes a
'theoretically-powered cartographic tool' to support the
multi-directional emergence of a posthuman subjectivity]{.underline}
(Braidotti 2019). Reflecting on my own personal experience of subtle
mutations with AI, I find the affective power of mutation akin to what
Preciado (2013) has called "Potentia Gaudendi" or "orgasmic force",
which he describes as the most abstract and the most material of all
workforces. To paraphrase, Potentia Gaudendi embodies an indeterminate
capacity; it has no gender; its orientation emphasises neither the
feminine nor the masculine. It is not human nor animal, neither animate
nor inanimate, and creates no boundary between object and subject
(Preciado, 2013, p 34). My mutating body is neither an organism nor a
machine. Rather it passes as a "fluid, dispersed, networking
techno-organic-textual-mythic system" (Preciado, 2013, p. 35), a
performative phenomenon with no absolute exteriority or interiority
(Barad, 2013), inhabiting the boundary between the physical and the
metaphysical. [We inhabit the mutant and it inhabits us]{.underline}.
Preciado, recalling the transformative effects constituted by testogel,
and the effects of testosterone mixing with their blood (which can be
understood within this text as mutation), states that "My body is
present to itself\" (Preciado, 2013, emphasis added). The
[self-reflexive awareness of oneself produced through mutation is a
critical feature of how we might engage with mutations more deliberately
and thoughtfully through design]{.underline}. Preciado writes, \"I am
the future common artificial ancestor for the elaboration of new species
in the perpetually random process of mutation and genetic drift\"
(Preciado, 2013, p.2). Transferred to the context of AI, becoming with
AI can be seen as a sustained performative practice of worldbuilding
that embraces mutating multitudes. By understanding AI as a queer body
containing multitudes, co-conspiring through synthetic-alliances between
differently situated embodied subjects, [we may begin to explore how AI
embodies multiplicity, mutates, and resists solidified definitions.
Recognising the resistance of solidified definitions and sustained
performance, AI exists in **constant negotiation** between biological,
technological, cultural and computational systems]{.underline}. If a
designer were to engage more intentionally with AI, and the social
application of AI, they would do well to engage with the stuff of
mutations, the orgasmic force between things that changes things. Then,
perhaps we could be better prepared to design with mutations, with the
social, cultural, political and biological implications and consequences
of those mutations in mind. 5. Conclusion There is increasing awareness
in design and HCI communities that [queering as a strategy may help
subvert existing sociotechnical systems and codings of hegemonic
worldviews that **reinscribe** unsustainable, unethical and apolitical
design practices]{.underline} (Spiel & Keyes et al., 2019) (Light,
2011). Along these lines, [there is an urgent need to critically
re-think the capacity of design to cope with the increasing complexity
and dynamism of (socio)technical systems that actively learn, anticipate
and adapt over time while in use]{.underline} (Giaccardi & Redström,
2020). To return to Muñoz\'s (2009) notion of queer futurity and
queerness as an open horizon imbued with potentiality, this research
calls for [queer turnings toward design's engagement with AI as a
growing research agenda and field of practice]{.underline} (Bell & Broad
et al., 2022). As part of a larger research project, this paper aims to
contribute to the scholarly discourse on design as it intersects with
AI, offering insight into the potentiality for becoming with AI,
otherwise, as individuals, as a society and as a species. Although the
Mutant In the Mirror provides only a glimpse into designing
interventions for refusal or at best an aspirational
deterritorialization of AI, it does signal as an experiment novel
practices toward queering AI. More critical (and playful) exploration
and experimentation in design/ing towards queer becomings with AI are
needed.

Temporalities of the Nuclear Condition," Cambridge Scholars

When Jonathan Schell's The Fate of the Earth first appeared in 1982, its
most talked-about passage was a graphic description of what would happen
if a twenty-megaton bomb were detonated over the center of Manhattan.
The ensuing account of how a full-scale nuclear change would likely
extinguish humankind along with the majority of earth's species, leaving
a "republic of insects and grass," completed the book's infernal vision.
Largely owing to this vivid thought-experiment, Schell's book helped
reenergize the anti-nuclear movement in the U.S., and its cautionary
portrait of a dead, irradiated planet was absorbed into mass-culture
such that, read now, it chastens but does not stun. But there is a
still-astonishing moment in The Fate of the Earth. This occurs in a
section called "The Second Death," where Schell adopts "the view of our
children and grandchildren, and of all the future generations of
mankind, stretching ahead of us in time." [A nuclear extinction event,
he argues, would wipe out not only the living but all of the unborn as
well; this "second death" would be the death of a longitudinal,
progenerative human future, the death of the supersession of generations
and thus, as he puts it, "the death of death."]{.underline}2 That we
live in the shadow of the death of death, says Schell, is nowhere more
apparent than in our growing ambivalence toward---and here is the
surprise---marriage, an institution that consecrates a personal
relationship by connecting it to the biological continuity of the
species. "\[By\] swearing their love in public," he writes, "the lovers
also let it be known that their union will be a fit one for bringing
children into the world." In a world overshadowed by extinction, the
biological future that endows love with social meaning begins to
dematerialize, and love becomes, in response, "an ever more solitary
affair: impersonal, detached, pornographic. It means something that we
call both pornography and nuclear destruction 'obscene.'" Although
Schell is not explicit about what forms of sexual detachment he laments
here, "The Second Death" clearly implies that any sex decoupled from
biological continuity and seeking refuge in licentious, solitary,
distant, or momentary enjoyment---any sex that deviates from a
reproductive notion of the future---is a symptom of our nuclear
extinction syndrome. [Thus when Schell, oddly quoting Auden, says that
the peril of extinction thwarts "Eros, builder of cities," he doesn't
need to invoke "sodomy, destroyer of cities" for a link between
queerness and extinction to be forged]{.underline}.[3 By **installing a
reproductive futurism** at the heart of his admonitory project, Schell
implicitly stigmatizes as futureless anyone who stands beyond
reproductivism's pale: not just the homosexual but also the unmarried,
the divorced, the impotent, the childless, the masturbator, the
hedonist, the celibate.]{.underline}

Schell's book did not, of course, invent the use of reproduction as a
metonym for human futurity tout court or the figuration of the
biological child as the chief beneficiary of future-oriented actions in
the present. But it contributed to these figures' prominent standing in
the anti-nuclear imaginary. "Believe me when I say to you / I hope the
Russians love their children too" went the absurd refrain of Sting's
1985 single, "Russians," which placed the (implicitly reproductive) body
at a level more fundamental than political difference: "We share the
same biology / Regardless of ideology." One could go on to compile a
long list of 1980s movies, novels, speeches, and tracts that made the
nuclear family stand in for humanity's beset future or invoked the child
as the figure in whose name apocalypse must be averted or at least
survived. These conventions would outlast the Cold War and the waning or
reimagining of the nuclear referent. [Think of P. D. James's 1992
thriller The Children of Men, whose protagonist must safeguard a
miraculous pregnancy in a future where fertility has declined globally
to zero.]{.underline}4 Or of how Cormac McCarthy's The Road (2006) pares
the matter of survival in a post-apocalyptic, ambiguously nuked
landscape down to a father's efforts to protect his son from rape and
cannibalism. [In both cases, the future is hanging either literally or
allegorically by the thread of a single imperiled child.]{.underline}

My aim in this essay is not to trace the reproductivist energies of Cold
War anti-nuclear works or of more recent post-apocalyptic fiction.
Instead, I chart an alternate path through the nuclear condition,5 one
that diverges from---and in places dissents from---the portrait of a
future secured primarily for the sake of the biological child and
reached along the straight lines of reproductive heterosexual coupling,
familial property heritage, and linear time. [This alternate path is one
on which Nuclear Criticism today might keep company with recent work on
queer temporalities, a body of scholarship that places dissident
sexuality in a critical relation to normative models of time and
history. One of my broader aims, in fact, is to indicate some of the
ways Nuclear Criticism might be reenergized by an encounter with queer
temporalities scholarship]{.underline}. At the same time, I'll argue
that some of the key theoretical and literary works associated with
Nuclear Criticism in its early years were themselves engaged in queering
temporality and history. In doing so I don't wish to claim Nuclear
Criticism as the occulted or lost "origin" of queer temporalities work;
in addition to straining credibility, such a privileging of origin in a
narrative of linear development would install queer temporalities
scholarship in just the sort of historical narrative it seeks to vex by
its devotion to non-linear modes---the recursive, the discontinuous, the
counterfactual. My point is, rather, that reexamining Nuclear Criticism
through the aperture of queer theoretical writings on time allows us to
see a muted or latent critique in the former---a critique whose object
was not so much the existence of nuclear weapons as the straitened
portraits of desire, culture, kinship, history, and futurity that were
often appealed to in calling for both those weapons' abolition and their
necessity. What emerges is a redrawn Nuclear Criticism that both
deplores the existence of nuclear weapons and declines to embrace
sexually normative and historically reductive grounds for their
elimination.

"Queer temporalities" as a theoretical rubric covers a broad range of
scholarship by queer theorists and activists working, at least to date,
predominantly in the U.S.6 More specific than a turn toward time as
theme, [this scholarship considers how heternormative cultures perceive
queer subjects in relation to history and futurity]{.underline}; how
queer subjects experience and enact particular relations to history and
futurity; and how queerness itself might be rethought as having less (or
less exclusively) to do with sex and sexual typology than with dissident
ways of being in relation to time. [I have already referred to one of
the chief temporalities from which queer subjects are variously excluded
and dissenting: the "**reproductive futurism**" that conscripts the
child as mascot for a **heternormative politics** of hope and a linear
conception of history as both powered and figured by biological
reproduction and the modes of inheritance and political succession it
undergirds]{.underline}.7 Such a conception of history militates against
certain kinds of transgenerational affect, not least against the notion
that the living could invest affectively in or form communities with the
dead. In response, some scholars working on queer temporalities advocate
just such a queer desire for history or "touch of the queer," the kind
of unpunctual, affective approach that could permit one to ask, as
Carolyn Dinshaw does, "How does it feel to be an anachronism?"8 While
acknowledging that the feeling of being out of step with one's
contemporaries can be exploited to repressive ends, Dinshaw remains
optimistic that transtemporal communities---living anachronisms in
league with the dead---might produce politically salutary effects in a
present whose dense multiplicity they help to restore.9 Others,
contrastingly, refuse a politics of hope they see as irreducibly
heternormative, urging queer subjects to embrace the negative position
assigned them by reproductivism. Embracing this negativity can take many
forms: an insistence on the destructive, anti-communitarian, at once
selfish and self-shattering dimensions of sex and particularly homo-sex;
an identification of the queer subject with destrudo (i.e., the Freudian
death drive) in its relentless opposition to a procreative understanding
of libido; or a refusal of queer triumphalism and an embrace of the
shame-laced backward look. 10 Still others look to fuse the negativity
of these anti-social, arguably apolitical positions to a radical
anti-racist and anti-capitalist stance, calling for a "punk negativity"
whose oppositional politics declines the language of hope, redemption,
and futurity and turns instead to vandalism, masochism, pessimism, and
despair.11 Real differences inhere among these approaches. But they
share a core conviction: that temporality---and perhaps futurity even
more intensively than historicity---cannot be thought apart from the
sexual norms through which it is figured, licensed, and imbued with or
emptied of affect.

Owing to its semi-dormancy since the early 1990s, Nuclear Criticism has
largely missed the chance to think through queer theory, a field whose
principal interventions have happened in the interim. You occasionally
see comparisons between queer coming-out narratives and a nation's
coming out as a nuclear power or a military person's coming out as an
anti-nuclear activist. But the more suggestive commonalities between
Nuclear Criticism and queer theoretical writing---most of them under the
sign of temporality---remain unexplored. These include an intimate
acquaintance with and even an embrace of the death drive; a related
acquaintance with portraits of the future as negated or foreclosed; a
commitment not to reopen the future under repressive terms; and the
alternative, in the face of a seemingly barred future, of soliciting the
queer touch of the dead whom for various reasons we suddenly apprehend
as our contemporaries. [Exploring these commonalities seems the more
urgent, given that queer temporalities scholarship could provoke debate
about what nuclear abolitionists and their opponents have most in
common: a practically automated recourse to reproductive futurism in
arguing for their respective positions. Schell's equation of low marital
indices with a general sense of species futurelessness is an extreme but
not an exceptional case of antinuclear rhetoric, which continues today
to **invoke "a world safe for our children"** in terms nearly
indistinguishable from the pro-nuclear side of the aisle.12]{.underline}
The radical negativity exhibited by some queer temporalities scholars
might also expose the limits of a politics of (procreative) optimism on
both sides of the nuclear debate---[the limits of acting as if the world
could be made safe for "our children" or anyone else by either retaining
or abolishing our nuclear deterrents.]{.underline}

[Queer theorists, for their part, have turned occasionally during the
last twenty years to Nuclear Criticism, although usually to jump-start
an argument headed away from the nuclear referent]{.underline}. Peter
Coviello's essay "Apocalypse from Now On" (2000) nods in its title to
both Jacques Derrida's inaugural work of Nuclear Criticism, "No
Apocalypse, Not Now (full speed ahead, seven missiles, seven missives)"
(1984) and Susan Sontag's 1989 AIDS and Its Metaphors (Sontag:
"Apocalypse is now a long-running serial: not 'Apocalypse Now' but
'Apocalypse from Now On'").13 But Coviello's essay invokes the nuclear
condition principally in order to set up what he sees as its succession,
after 1989, by AIDS as the apocalypse du jour. "Du jour" in the way a
daily special marks the everyday's domestication of the exceptional: for
Coviello, AIDS differs from the nuclear condition in quotidienizing
apocalypse, making it a condition rather than a threatened event and
thus particularly useful to the day-to-day biopolitical operations of
the state. Coviello, in other words, sets sail from Port Derrida for
Port Sontag---from Nuclear Criticism to a critique of AIDS and
governmentality---without, understandably enough, booking return
passage. Before leaving the nuclear behind, however, he notes "how
intimately bonded the nuclear and the sexual actually were, before the
advent of AIDS gave to such bonding a ghastly quality of
inevitability."14 [Coviello's emphasis is not on the usual string of
references to the heteronormative sexualization of nuclear weapons
(e.g., "Little Boy," Bikini atoll, the population bomb, and the nuclear
family, although he mentions these in passing). Instead, he reads
nuclear discourse as having limned, before AIDS, a "gay death drive"
that figured queerness as incarnating (and more rarely as rebuking) the
extravagant sovereignty of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Glossing Martin
Amis's characterization of the nuclear arsenal as a cocked gun in the
mouths of the procreative, Coviello writes that "power in the nuclear
age is horrifying and unlivable because it makes me---or wants to make
me---thoroughly, irremediably queer." 15

[Thus the homophobia of certain anti-nuclear discourses anticipated
homophobic responses to AIDS as an apocalyptic threat emanating from
queer subjects]{.underline}. [What's more, Coviello hazards, the
**apocalypticism that pervaded debates** around both nuclear weapons and
AIDS made for strong continuities between Nuclear Criticism and queer
theory, both bodies of work responding to high concentrations of state
power in the **management of populations**, bilateral depictions of the
biological family as under siege, and the pervasive rhetoric of the
death wish.162]{.underline}

War and Peace

How does Queer IR scholarship contribute to the study of war and peace?
Like Mainstream IR, Queer IR examines the use of military force in
international politics, including its effects and conditions of
possibility. Like Feminist Security Studies, Queer IR approaches war and
the use of armed force as embedded in a larger continuum of(gendered and
sexualized) violence challenging analytical binaries like war/peace,
international/domestic, and public/private. [Queer IR research furthers
Feminist Security Studies' inquiries into the constitutive role of the
"low politics" of the (allegedly) "merely" private, intimate and/or
cultural by drawing attention to how geopolitics and military operations
are shaped not only by gendered norms but also by sexualized norms and
normativities, specifically heterosexuality and associated ideas about
heteromasculinity and cissexism.]{.underline}

Gender, Peace, and Security

Queer IR research on war, peace, and security brings into focus the
security needs of LGBT subjects[. For example, Queer IR has revealed
security problems faced by LGBT people that are rendered invisible even
in feminist analyses of human security (Amar,2013), sexual and
gender-based violence (Hagen, 2016), and post-conflict reconstruction
(Jauhola, 2010, 2013; McEvoy, 2015)]{.underline}. Both feminist and
non-feminist analyses of International Relations commonly rest on
assumptions about gender and sexuality that are damaging to LGBT
individuals in a range of conflict and post-conflict related settings.

For example, scholars' and practitioners' common assumptions about
heterosexuality as the default sexuality and kinship norm
("heteronormativity") and the twin assumption of two "opposite" and
complementary gender positions are cissexist because they leave
outsubjects whose sexuality, familial relations, and/or gender
expression ("cissexism") do notalign with these gender and sexual norms.
While there is increasing awareness of certain non-normative sexualities
("homosexuality") and sexual practices ("Men-who-have-Sexwith-Men"),
with few exceptions, key international actors and policy frameworks in
the area of peace and security rest on what Queer and Transgender theory
describes as cisprivilege. Cisprivilege refers to people whose gender
assigned at birth matches their gender identity ("cisgender").

As Jamie Hagen (2016) explores in the context of the UN's Women, Peace
and Security(WPS) architecture, [heteronormativity and cissexism
**obscure** a wide set of **practices of violence and exclusions**
negatively affecting people that are not straight or
cisgender.]{.underline} Ha[gen shows how deploying a limited
understanding of a **heteronormative gender binary** allows WPS policy
and monitoring to account for the security needs of heterosexual
cisgender women, while **obscuring LGBT subjects and their
safety**]{.underline}. This framework also reproduces insecurities for
the "women" it is meant to protect, in particular those with queer
sexualities and non-normative gender expression. For instance, [trans
people and gender non-binary people are typically refused medical care,
safe access to bathrooms in shelters, and refugee camps]{.underline}
(see also Jauhola, 2010, 2013). [Neither is sexual and gender based
violence against gay men recognized and accounted for under the WPS
architecture, even though their **presumed lack of masculinity** makes
them vulnerable to rape during conflict (Hagen, 2016, p.
315f.).]{.underline}

II\. De-colonizing Mars and Beyond

When NASA received a signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 2012, they
called it "the sound of interstellar space" and marked the data as the
moment human exploration crossed into the "space between stars" (NASA
JPL n.d.). [And while science and technology take us to the edges of the
solar system and beyond, venture capital is planning how they can
terraform new worlds --- a neoliberal, capitalist project which has, of
course, already stolen the phrase]{.underline} "Occupy." In response, we
need to pre-emptively Occupy Mars while taking one of the many important
lessons offered by indigenous people to the Occupy movement, and
de-colonize Mars in the process. Which means injecting all of our queer
and indigenous selves into the discussions about "settling" and
"colonizing" Mars, into these plans to fundamentally change the surface
of another planet, to reproduce Earth there.

Lisa Messeri, anthropologist and historian of science and technology,
points out that if I use queering to mean something odd then something
like Elon Musk's plan to nuke Mars, for example, might be seen as queer.
Her excellent question about this and our chat on Twitter inspired me to
clarify. I'm looking at Musk's terraforming language from the position
that Mars is already queer. Remaking Mars in Earth's image, and
uncritically assuming this is a great idea, is exactly the kind of
process that queering works against. Nuking mars is an unqueer thing to
do because it uses the model of razing and rebuilding, cutting it all
down to make it possible to build a normative landscape on top of the
ruins. [We need to think about the ways that terraforming is not always
a utopian idea, but can also be seen as a **violent imposition** of
earthly normativity on landscapes elsewhere, a colonialization of
existing queer-otherworld landscapes.]{.underline}

Biologist DNLee has asked exactly the kind of questions about Elon
Musk's language and the discourse of Mars colonization that need to be
asked:

"[Who's version of humanity is being targeted for saving?]{.underline}
And with the language of proposed interplanetary exploration and
settlement using generous references to Christopher Columbus and New
World Exploration and British Colonization and US American Manifest
Destiny I was halted. I'm not on board for this type of science
adventure. \[...\]

[Why aren't other voices and perspectives at the table? How much is this
conversation being controlled (framed, initiated, directed, routed) by
**capitalist and political interests** of the (few) people at the
table?"]{.underline}

Social scientists, activists, queer theorists and others need to ask
themselves why they aren't asking these same questions (and joining
those of us who are). Aside from a few examples, why have sociology,
anthropology, and other social sciences and humanities left space
science and exploration alone --- why do they consistently fail to
recognize the importance of work by those who do research in these
areas?

Astrobiologist David Grinspoon critiqued this frontier mentality early
on. Writing about the ethics of colonizing Mars in 2004, he notes that
it's not only problematic for all of the above reasons, it also sets us
up to reproduce the failures that come with thinking we can "conquer" a
planet: "If we go to Mars with the idea that we can charge ahead and
subdue a new world, our efforts are doomed \[...\] Mars does not belong
to 'America,' nor to Earth, nor to human beings." As DNLee also points
out, we're talking about widespread discourse with massive national and
corporate funding to support a new era of colonization --- isn't this a
subject worth studying? Worth funding studies of? Worth getting involved
in?

Space scientists are also working on the problem of how we can create
the capabilities to visit another star, trying to figure out what we
need to do now here on Earth to make that happen in 100 years. There are
many interstellar projects, and it's a fascinating convergence of calls
for longer-term thinking with planning and innovation in space science.
When astronaut Mae Jemison describes 100 Year Starship --- the project
to achieve interstellar travel --- she talks about creation stories,
mythology, science fiction, and her hopes of "discovering a better
version of ourselves in space" (100YSS 2014). We can join with
visionaries like her to ensure that the "better version of ourselves"
isn't a vision that ends up reproducing inequality, injustice, and
oppressions from Earth out there in space. Space advocates like Jemison,
the first black woman in space, will be leaders and allies in the quest
to discover not only diversity in outer space but a better kind of
diversity --- one that is aware of colonial histories, oppressive pasts
and presents, ongoing violences here on Earth. A queer diversity.

III\. Extraterrestrial Allies

The Interstellar Message Composition program at the SETI Institute
(Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) advocates sending messages
across the stars because "the universe beckons" (Shostak 2015). I happen
to agree --- there's a lot out there and if there wasn't life elsewhere,
life that we might be able to talk to, it would certainly be "an awful
waste of space" (as Carl Sagan wrote). And yet on the flip side when
NASA releases vintage-style travel posters for newly discovered
exoplanets featuring apparently white, binary-gendered, human couples,
what message are we already sending both to Earth and beyond? [That we
expect the entire universe to look at act like us? Not all of us of
course, just the elite few, the **white, cis-gendered, heterosexual
colonialist aristocracy** in evening wear.]{.underline}

[NASA's binary gender, heterosexual, nightlife in space
poster.]{.underline}

I realize this is supposed to be a light-hearted poster and it's "all in
good fun" --- so even writing this critique makes me sound like I'm
absolutely no fun. Quite the opposite, I think that poster is no fun!
Why couldn't it depict other life? Like multi-gendered whale-cats
dancing instead? Or humans who don't look like these two? Or something
else, anything else --- anything otherwise. Where is the imagination? Is
this transposition of earthly aristocrats into space the best we can do?
It's more evidence that we need queer visions of life elsewhere, of
exoplanets, of alien worlds. We need more of what Haraway (2013),
drawing on Marleen Barr (1992), calls "speculative fabulation."

[This isn't just me saying "what about my ideas" or "include me in your
game" --- because we've actually been there since the beginning. We've
been imagining different worlds since we were born into a world where we
often weren't wanted, didn't fit, and weren't following the rules by
just being us. Queer folk, of all kinds, are at least united by having
the most incredible skills in **speculative fabulation**--- in
envisioning every possible different future, bright and abysmal, and we
do it because it's something we learned as a survival tactic and later
honed as an art form.]{.underline}

IV\. Generations of Queer Futures

[Queerness has been discussed and debated in terms of the **concept of
"no future**]{.underline}." When thinking about outer space, this could
mean the freedom to disrupt normative futures --- to remix, twist,
adjust, tear, collage and queer the future. As anthropologist Naisargi
Dave said about the idea: "I think queerness is precisely about what it
means to pursue an orientation to the world, philosophically and
politically, that doesn't need to reproduce itself in recognizable
forms." Being freed from recognizable reproduction means opening up
multiple possible futures, even queer futures.

Intelligent residents of Earth who do not seem very interested in
structurally oppressing one another.

When space science and fiction imagines a "generation ship," in which
generations of crew live and die during a thousand-year voyage to a
distant star (e.g., Ceyssens et al. 2012), [we should ask how queer
lives fit into these models of reproduction in space.]{.underline} In
the recent Sci-Fi series Ascension (Williams 2014), [queer people were
**excluded from a generation ship experiment**. When one character said
"homosexuals" or "anyone who avoids procreation" were left out because
they're "superfluous"--- a queer character responded: "We do tend to pop
up where you least expect us\..."]{.underline}

If we consider science fiction as a "repository of modifiable futures"
in science (Milburn 2010) then we can look at how to de-colonize that
fiction and challenge the reproduction of normative futures through
imagination and science. William Lempert has examined the way indigenous
Sci-Fi does this in his article "Decolonizing Encounters of the Third
Kind: Alternative Futuring in Native Science Fiction Film" (2014), and a
recently published collection of science fiction stories from social
justice movements "Octavia's Brood" (Imarisha and Brown 2015) reminds us
that imagination, as philosopher John Dewey said, is our "common faith"
(1934) --- the shared human capacity to conceive of a better future and
work together to make it a reality.

Astronaut Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space, appearing as an
extra on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" with Levar Burton.

Science fiction is a "repository of modifiable futures" not only in
science but also in society. Sci-Fi has been a site of racism, sexism,
and xenophobia, as often as it has been the site of imagining better
worlds and liberation (Haraway 2013). [The recent battle over the Hugo
awards demonstrates the lengths that some will go to to **protect their
visions** of hostile, racist, misogynist, **anti-queer, normative
futures.**]{.underline}

So what's next? [We --- all us queer, trans, disabled, black, native,
etc. folk and more --- we need to fight back, take back, de-colonize and
**re-imagine our futures in outer space,** we need to pop up where they
least expect us.]{.underline}

[Global lockdown thus functions as one of the looming underbellies and
conditions of possibility of the (un)freedoms and (non)futures being
promised by neoliberal empire]{.underline}. Consigning the collective
traumas of slavery and colonization to a remote and irrelevant past
while drawing on their logics to instantiate its rule, global lockdown
shows itself to be neither cruel and unusual nor exceptional, but rather
as foundational. Importantly, these (un)freedoms and (non)futures carry
very different promises and pleasures depending on our relationship to
the human surplus motoring the global political economy. Global
lockdown, then, is not simply the newest outside, but quite literally
the material redefining off what life can even mean in the wake of so
much "necessary" death. 136 Radical History Review Agathangelou,
Bassichis, and Spira \| Intimate Investments 137 Toward an Intimate
Politics of Decolonizing Abolitionism [We have thus far argued that
across diffuse spaces and moments---the homonormative turn, the
neoliberalization of the economy, the war on terror, and global
lockdown---we see different dimensions of a promise project, which is
also a project **forever seeking to (re)consolidate
empire.**]{.underline} On the one hand, there are those for whom
subjectivity, capital, and satiating pleasures and rights are being
forever promised. This occurs, we argue, at the expense of compliance
with, or perhaps distraction from, the larger structural underpinnings
of social relations and processes. On the other hand, [there are the
(non)subjects for whom the same promise has not been issued, the
abject(s) whose lives and deaths are completely nonspectacular within
the dominant imaginations.]{.underline} Adding to this contradiction is
the dimension that even the promises themselves are tenuous: indeed, as
elite queers privilege homonormativity over more radical political and
economic praxes, neoconservative forces continue to criminalize
queerness. While first and foremost queers outside this elite or
national racial strata are produced as exterminable sodomites, the
category of the abject and killable always threatens even elite queers
in first world spaces. [This is part of the politico-economic and
affective logics that have fueled a frenzied search for an end to pain:
continue imperial soldiering in exchange for a mirage of security, or
spend your energies fighting other queers for a prized space as most
radical.]{.underline} With such a paucity of choices, [our energies
are]{.underline} directed away from building solidarities and [exhausted
by fixing on individualized solutions and fueling the (re)production of
neoliberal, neoconservative, homonormative, and ultimately
**heteronormative worlds.**]{.underline} If the neoliberal turn has been
part of a larger strategy of counterinsurgency mobilized in the wake of
revolutionary decolonization movements threatening capitalism,
(hetero)sexism, and white supremacy, it is important to pause on some of
the impacts of that (counter)mobilization. In this paper we have worked
to foreground the affective logics that function on the level of feeling
and desire in the service of a neoliberal project of a world remade. To
begin to articulate the ways in which our most 'intimate'
sensibilities---[our fears, desires, mourning, and yearning---are being
mobilized by a regime of global lockdown is to make urgent the
production of solidarities not premised upon exploitation, profit, or
death. For those engaged in movements dismantling the prison industrial
complex and any form of imperial violence, it is precisely these
affective economies to which we must be attentive.]{.underline} If we do
not work to articulate the ways in which we become libidinally and
erotically invested in the status quo of mass lockdown---in effect, the
various promises that the prison issues---we run the risk of reproducing
the racialized and sexualized economies of benevolence and exploitation
that fortify so much of conservative, liberal, and even radical praxis.
However, as we have sought to argue, the price of such dismissals is
nothing less than participation in imperial violence that, ultimately,
impacts us all. Amidst the many affective callings and seductive
offerings we are issued, [we must continue the work of imagining
alternative ways to feel, be, and love in this moment of intensified
empire-building]{.underline}. To [become completely drawn into
challenging homonormativization without attention to the larger
structural underpinnings of social relations and processes may
ultimately prove unproductive as it misses the larger imperial logics
that may be embodied differentially in other sites.]{.underline}
Moreover, it becomes impossible to discern the relationship between our
own struggles and the set of promises and nonpromises offered to other
others. Foreclosing potential and increasingly crucial solidarities, we
are drawn into our own corners and ultimately diverted from the
possibilities of massive, cross-bordered mobilizations, movements and
revolutionary projects. [In the place of this vision, we offer first and
foremost a disruption of complicity, a refusal of empire's promise
project. The series of wars in which empire asks us to participate are
utterly genocidal, rather than constituting processes that enable our
security and healing.]{.underline} As members of different and
overlapping communities and struggles, the authors have each grappled
personally with this process. As activists and intellectuals who are
engaged in struggles around war, migration and trafficking, labor and
homelessness, mass imprisonment, and state violence against queer and
transgender communities, we are confronted with the seductive---yet
ultimately murderous---promises that are described in this essay.
Moreover, as members of the academy at different levels (undergraduate
student, graduate student, and faculty member), we have witnessed how
the strategies of promise and nonpromise projects have worked to
fragment, divide, and conquer people of color, working-class people,
queers, transgender people, postcolonial subjects, and others within
powerful academic zones of knowledge production. [Recognizing that we
can never be **outside empire's seductive offerings,** we engage these
questions out of rage, hope, and the desire to form life-sustaining
solidarities and intimacies. We strive with others toward a politics
that enables intimacies as both means and ends, as a strategy of
movement-building in which relationships are formed not to instantiate
empire's incessant production of internal and external enemies, but to
disrupt it. This is a politics that would challenge histories that
dichotomize and fragment our worlds, and instead offer praxes of erotic
resistance in which we might be able to glimpse a breathing space for
reconstituting connections and relations based in collectivity and
healing.]{.underline} With this analysis in mind, all attempts to
separate and make discrete struggles for social justice and
transformation---those working for prison abolition, sexual and gender
freedom, decolonization, and the end to war, for example---prove
unsuccessful. [They are always already imbricated in one another. When
one struggles to resist coercive sexual or gender
regimes---heternormativization as well as homonormativization---one is
already engaging in a politics deeply implicated in the wars on terror,
poverty, and drugs, and in the (neo)slaveries of the prison industrial
complex.]{.underline} 138 Radical History Review Agathangelou,
Bassichis, and Spira \| Intimate Investments 139 This is true not only
because of the devastating impacts these wars have had on queer
communities and sexually aberrant (non)subjects locked away, and because
of the ways in which a racializing "sodomotification" is drawn on to
produce the criminal and the terrorist. [Indeed, the violence and death
that we authorize and face operate through and within **our libidinal,
erotic, and affective investments,** investments that we must engage
directly and rigorously if we are to disrupt the seductive workings of
power in their most intimate dimensions.]{.underline} If, then, all
[**queer politics** are already **organizing around and implicated in
the buildup of global lockdown and imperialist war**,]{.underline} the
question is not if a praxis of decolonization and abolitionism is
pertinent to queer struggles, but how and why it is. If it is true that
our deepest desires, feelings, and arousals are tapped into for imperial
production, it also becomes crucial to ask [how we might organize,
mobilize, and **form alternative intimacies and desires**.]{.underline}
[These alternatives, which continue to be nurtured in radical and
revolutionary movements and collectivities, are forged **as a disruption
to individualized, consumptive, and privatized erotics** in the name of
broader collective projects of freedom and transformation that cultivate
the pleasures of substantial connection and the production of more
egalitarian relations.]{.underline} These are the intimacies that form
the core of decolonizing imaginaries, those that understand sexual
freedom only through collective self-determination. It is only when we
engage the traumas as well as the yearnings of our pasts and our futures
that we might be able to seize the possibilities increasingly foreclosed
by empire's seductive promises.

The family

Though the sociality of the US Army breeds all kinds of intimacies (see
MacLeish 2013), when "Family" (very often written with a capital F) is
evoked in military programs or official materials, the referent is the
domestic unit comprising soldier, spouse, and usually children. One
reason for this is that soldiers are, as a population, more married than
civilians of the same age. But this fact is neither mere coincidence nor
evidence of some soldierly essence. It is a fact cultivated through
structures of entitlements and benefits that have sought to make the
military a more "family-friendly" place, part of a concerted strategy to
recruit and retain soldiers after the end of the draft in 1973. Today,
the military considers the families of soldiers part of its "total
force" (Chu, Hall, and Jones 2007), acknowledging that without them, and
with the intensity of multiple deployments that has characterized the
last decade and a half, they would be unable to meet their own
institutional readiness needs[. This specific form of family is further
honed by the logistics of military life, which can mean frequent moves
with a **nuclear family** away from broader networks of
kin.4]{.underline} [Together with a whole slew of **heteronormative
forces**,]{.underline}5 the picture of "Army Family" that emerges is
multiply reinforced and decidedly nuclear, with the conjugal couple
squarely at the centre. And more than an aspect of demographics, this
picture literally represents Army Family in countless images
accompanying websites and promotional material about military life and
resources for families.

[The military is an institution that amplifies, projects, and is deeply
invested in exemplary forms of normativity -- especially those addressed
to embodiments of gender.6 No surprise, then, that the normative force
of the conjugal couple at the centre of this picture of the Army Family
does not belong to the Army alone. Queer theory has done much to
illuminate how this form -- and the logics of personhood, proper and
improper intimacy, and generational time that subtend it -- structures
public and political life in the contemporary U]{.underline}S (Berlant
2000; Berlant and Warner 1998), [aligning the good life, or perhaps even
life worth living at all, with heteronormative forms of reproduction and
sociality]{.underline} (Edelman 2004; Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and Posocco
2013). Elizabeth Povinelli has elaborated how the conjugal couple in
particular, rather than the group (a competing social form in active
duty army life; Povinelli 2006, 181), is a key form through which proper
personhood is seen to emerge in liberal fantasies (Povinelli 2006,
175--236). This [remains true in the Army, where the conjugal couple
both supports and threatens the other forms of institutional intimacy
out of which soldiers' socialities are made (MacLeish 2013, Chapter 4),
as well as in the afterwar for soldiers and veterans whose lives are
forever marked by war but who are nonetheless supposed to be edging
further away from those institutional intimacies of the Army and toward
other sustaining civilian ones]{.underline} (Wool, forthcoming, Chapter
5).

There is a long history of concern for soldiers' sexual lives and hope
that, especially after war, they might settle into normative patterns of
husband and fatherhood (Linker 2011). [Given the ways that post-war
rehabilitation has always been a gendered project, and the
**inextricability of gendered personhood** and the configuring of sexual
intimacies, this should hardly be surprising]{.underline}. But in the
post-9/11 context, this family form has become more vital to fantasies
of veteran futures than in American wars of the past. What seems new in
the contemporary moment is the explicit centrality of such hope and
concern to rehabilitative projects (broadly defined; Wool 2014), and, of
special interest to the problematic I'm sketching here, the hinging of
normative family forms to fears about suicide through the mechanisms of
support and care.
