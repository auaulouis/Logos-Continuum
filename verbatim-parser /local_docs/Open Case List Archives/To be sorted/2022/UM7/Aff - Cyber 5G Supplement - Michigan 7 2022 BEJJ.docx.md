Chinese-made Huawei equipment could disrupt US nuclear arsenal
communications,\"

On paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the [Chinese
government was offering]{.underline} to spend [\$100 million to build an
**ornate Chinese garden** at the National Arboretum]{.underline} in
Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white
pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract
thousands of tourists every year.      

But [when US counterintelligence **officials** began digging into the
**details**, they found numerous **red flags**. The
**pagoda**]{.underline}, they noted, [would have been]{.underline}
strategically [placed on]{.underline} one of the highest points in
Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, [a **perfect spot**
for signals **intel**ligence **collection**]{.underline}, multiple
sources familiar with the episode told CNN.  

Also alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with
materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs
officials are barred from examining, the sources said.    

Federal officials quietly killed the project before construction was
underway.      

The canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence
activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US
security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese
espionage on US soil over the past decade.        

Since at least 2017, [federal officials have investigated
Chinese]{.underline} land [purchases near **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}, shut down a high-profile regional
consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies
and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening
devices near sensitive military and government facilities.    

[Among the **most alarming things** the FBI uncovered pertains
to]{.underline} Chinese-made [**Huawei equipment** atop **cell towers**
near **US military bases**]{.underline} in the rural Midwest. According
to multiple sources familiar with the matter, [the FBI determined the
equipment was capable of **capturing** and **disrupting** highly
restricted **Defense Department communications**, including those used
by US **Strat**egic **Com**mand, which oversees the country\'s **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}.

While broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military
installations have been well known, [the existence of this investigation
and its findings have **never been reported**]{.underline}. Its origins
stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to
CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national
security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak publicly.  

It\'s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data
was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers.
Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint,
it\'s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen
and sent overseas.   

The Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US.
Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable
of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense
Department. 

But [**multiple sources** familiar with the investigation
tell]{.underline} CNN that [there\'s no question the Huawei
equipment has the **ability** to **intercept** not only commercial cell
traffic but also the **highly restricted airwaves** used by the military
and **disrupt critical** US **Strat**egic **Com**mand communications,
giving the Chinese government a potential **window** into **America\'s
nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}.  

\"This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,\" said one
former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. \"[It would
impact our ability for essentially **c**ommand and **c**ontrol with the
**nuclear triad**. \"That goes into the **\'BFD\'
category**.\"]{.underline}      

\"If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad
day,\" this person added.     

Turning doves into hawks

Former officials described the probe\'s findings as a watershed moment.
The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the
White House and elsewhere in government weren\'t briefed on its
existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
     

That fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that
effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other
brands of Chinese made-equipment. \"The existence of the investigation
at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,\" said one former US
official.     

In 2020, Congress approved \$1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei
and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.       

But two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural
telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The
FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made
communications equipment---but according to a July 15 update from the
commission, it is more than \$3 billion short of the money it needs to
reimburse all eligible companies.

Absent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin
reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of
removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when
the money will be disbursed.

In late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security
concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided
information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former
senior US law enforcement official told CNN.

After the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce
Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more
urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from
US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current
senior US official said.

That probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official
said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that
external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when
software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese
government.

Depending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers
could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or
other penalties.

Reuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\
\"We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed
to securing our information and communications technology and services
supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign
information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national
security,\" a Commerce Department spokesperson said

US counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of
publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National
Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American
businesses and local and state governments about what it says are
disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.

FBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint
meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to
the Chinese threats.

In an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China
counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. \"That\'s probably
about 2,000 or so investigations,\" said Wray. \"And that\'s not even
talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking
program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen
more of Americans\' personal and corporate data than every nation
combined.\"

Asked why [after years of]{.underline} national security [**concerns**
raised over **Huawei**, the equipment is **still** largely in place
**atop cell towers near US military bases**]{.underline}, Wray said
that, \"We\'re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to
a nation state that doesn\'t adhere to and share our values, giving that
company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications
infrastructure.\"

He noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering
conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.

\"And I think that\'s probably about all I can say on the topic,\" said
Wray.

Critics see xenophobic overreach

Despite its tough talk, the US government\'s refusal to provide evidence
to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national
security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The
lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can
separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.   

\"All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified
by the FCC before being deployed there,\" Huawei said in its statement
to CNN. \"Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the
FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum
allocated to the DOD.\" 

\"For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in
cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber
security incidents,\" the statement said.  

In its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the
feds have cast too wide a net --- in particular as it relates to
academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge
acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom
the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China
Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing \"there was no evidence
presented that \[the professor\] ever collaborated with a Chinese
university in conducting NASA-funded research.\"      \
And on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against
an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no
longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down
the China Initiative entirely.   \
The federal government\'s reticence across multiple administrations to
detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of
chasing ghosts.   

\"It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor ---
because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems
crazy, that there\'s some plot behind every tree,\" said Anna Puglisi, a
senior fellow at Georgetown University\'s Center for Security and
Emerging Technology. \"However, China has shown us through its policies
and actions it is not a neutral actor.\"    

Chinese tech in the American heartland

As early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a
disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and
Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor
connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US,
including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.        

For years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper,
Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down
I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely
populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option
for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper,
reliable equipment.        

Beginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the
area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its
upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its
entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western
states.   

As Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal
investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter
told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling
cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be
unprofitable for Huawei --- but which placed its equipment near military
assets.      

Federal investigators initially began \"examining \[Huawei\] less from a
technical lens and more from a business/financial view,\" explained John
Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues
related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most
concentrated and looked for deals that \"made no sense from a
return-on-investment perspective,\" Lenkart said.    

\"A lot of \[counterintelligence\] concerns were uncovered based on\"
those searches, Lenkart said.   

By examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI
investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum
communications --- even though it had been certified by the
FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.  

\"It\'s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC
that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some
activation trigger to listen to other bands,\" said Eduardo Rojas, who
leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Florida. \"Technically, it\'s feasible.\" 

To prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would
require technical experts to strip down a device \"to the semi-conductor
level\" and \"reverse engineer the design.\" But, he said, it can be
done.   

And there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the
investigation said.

**[Weather camera worries ]{.underline}**

Around 2014, [Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance
cameras on its towers to live-stream **weather** and
**traffic**]{.underline}, a public service it shared with local news
organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the
[cameras provided a 24-7 bird\'s eye view of traffic and incoming
weather]{.underline}, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.      

But [they were also inadvertently capturing the **movement** of **US
military equipment** and **personnel**, giving Beijing --- or
anyone]{.underline} for that matter --- [the ability to **track** the
pattern of **activity** between a series of **closely guarded military
facilities**]{.underline}.    

The intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams
were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three
sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the
investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible
for Beijing\'s intelligence service to \"task\" the cameras --- hack
into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the
cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.    

Viaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could
be a national security risk.         

\"There\'s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some
military presence,\" DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado
office. But, he said, \"I was never told to remove the equipment or to
make any changes.\"  

In fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei
equipment from newspaper articles --- not the FBI --- and says he has
never been briefed on the matter.    

DiRico doesn\'t question the government\'s insistence that he needs to
remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China\'s intelligence
services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera
equipment.      

\"We monitor our network pretty good,\" DiRico said, adding that Viaero
took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei
shortly after installation. \"We feel we\'ve got a pretty good idea if
there\'s anything going on that\'s inappropriate.\"

[China's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine may be a **defining

**most**]{.underline} Central and Eastern [European states, the war, and
Beijing's embrace of Moscow, will result in a further **political

relations**]{.underline} as well: [The reception of **Chinese tech
companies** in these countries, **already under severe pressure**, will
suffer even **further scrutiny**]{.underline}. Perhaps, [more Chinese
firms will be **banned** from Central and Eastern European

What's more, [China's cooperation with **Russia** will further mobilize

### 1AR -- Eurasia DA -- AT: CCP Instability

#### CCP's resilient -- western academics are [biased]{.underline}.

**Tang 18** Wenfang Tang, Political Science Professor at the University
of Iowa. \[The "Surprise" of Authoritarian Resilience in China, American
Affairs, 2(1), 101--117\]//BPS

[The [info]{.mark}rmation explosion]{.underline} based on public opinion
surveys in China in the past thirty years [has [left]{.mark} **a few
[cracks in]{.mark}**]{.underline} the empirical foundation of some of
the classic [[theories]{.mark} of political science]{.underline} that
were [[first]{.mark} developed [in the West]{.mark}]{.underline} with
limited firsthand evidence. For example, the classic theory of civic
culture was developed from survey data in only five countries---the
United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Mexico. Today,
the World Values Surveys cover more than eighty countries in all
continents with human inhabitation. Among these countries, [[China
**stands out**]{.mark} **as an outlier** [and does not fit]{.mark} **the
theoretical predictions of [Western poli]{.mark}tical
[sci]{.mark}ence**]{.underline}. As discussed in the above mentioned
"surprises": (1) the Tiananmen protest in 1989 was an anti-reform
movement, but it was expected to be a pro-democratic movement; (2) [the
Chinese [regime enjoys **strong**]{.mark} **public [support]{.mark}**
[even though]{.mark}]{.underline} many in [[the West expected it
to]{.mark} have [collapse]{.mark}d]{.underline} already; (3) [[social
capital]{.mark} in China [is]{.mark} among **the [high]{.mark}est in the
world**]{.underline}, despite political science's expectation that its
authoritarian political system would produce public distrust; (4) [the
authoritarian [government is]{.mark} **(perceived to be) highly
[responsive]{.mark}**]{.underline} while the theory of democracy
predicts otherwise; and (5) [Chinese [citizens are]{.mark} **politically
[active]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} enjoy a strong feeling of political
efficacy]{.underline} even if they are expected to be politically
apathetic. One problem in the [existing political science
literature]{.underline} is the rigid (and black-and-white) definition of
democracy. For example, in the rankings of democracy and freedom by
Polity25 and Freedom House,26 both highly respected organizations whose
annual rankings are widely used in political science teaching and
research, China has been consistently ranked at the very bottom in terms
of freedom and democracy. Yet in the World Values Survey in 2012, more
than 60 percent of Chinese respondents said they felt free, which was
higher than in many democracies. Yes, [the Chinese]{.underline} may have
extremely low expectations, but they do [[feel
free]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [that feeling matters]{.underline}
because unhappy citizens can cause political disruption. The problem of
measurement error is not only limited to China. In fact, when comparing
the subjective feelings in public opinion surveys with the "objective"
measures of democracy in the rankings assigned by Polity and Freedom
House, public opinions throughout the world show a negative correlation
with the democracy rankings. This negative relationship between the
subjective and the "objective" measures of democracy can be clearly seen
in the chart below, based on the Global Barometer Surveys (2010--2015)
covering more than seventy countries and regions. The respondents in
these surveys were asked about their opinions regarding the following
six questions related to the levels of subjective democracy in their
societies: (1) The level of democracy is very high in my country; (2)
The democratic system in my country is functioning very well; (3)
Ordinary people in my country can freely express their opinions; (4) I
trust the media in my country; (5) My government responds to what people
need; and (6) I am satisfied with my government's performance. These six
items are combined into a single index of subjective democracy. When
this index is compared to the Polity scores of "objective" democracy in
these same countries and regions, the correlation coefficient is a
statistically significant --0.51! In other words, democratic citizens
feel less democracy and freedom in their societies than authoritarian
citizens. One way to solve the inconsistency between the subjective and
"objective" measures is to slightly stretch the concepts in the
political science literature. Concept stretching may carry a negative
meaning because it may result in the diluted explanatory power of a
theory. Yet overly rigid definitions can limit the scope and
effectiveness of political analysis. Some of the key concepts in
political science can be stretched (or enriched) by the available public
opinion surveys. For example, the traditional study of authoritarian
politics can include both elites and masses, and formal and informal
politics;27 social capital can incorporate both civic trust (trusting
strangers) and community-based interpersonal trust. More importantly,
the traditional definitions of democracy, freedom, government
responsiveness, and political legitimacy that are derived from
institutional designs (objective measures) can be enriched by including
public (not elite) perceptions of these concepts (subjective measures).
Those who only focus on the institutional design of democracy but
discount the importance of public perception of democracy run the risk
of political arrogance. Finally, a further barrier to understanding
China's authoritarian resilience is ideological bias. While people
outside China take it for granted that academic research in China is
ideologically limited, it is also true that [[China is]{.mark}
**frequently [judged]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **ideologically [tinted
glasses]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} some media organizations and
[[scholars]{.mark} in the West. [According to these]{.mark}]{.underline}
ideologically tinted [views, [the]{.mark} authoritarian political
[system]{.mark} in China [is]{.mark} **inherently
[bad]{.mark}**]{.underline}; supporting such a system is unhealthy;
civic trust is the only type that can qualify as interpersonal trust and
[social [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}; government responsiveness [[is
due to]{.mark} Chinese [citizens']{.mark} **"extremely [low
expectations]{.mark},"** and [so on. **These**]{.mark} **value
judgements** [prevent researchers from
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} what is working and what is not
working in [[the]{.mark} Chinese political [system]{.mark}]{.underline},
regardless of whether it is good or bad.

### 1AR -- Eurasia DA -- AT: China Diversionary War 

#### No diversionary war under Xi.

MSc from the London School of Economics, Dickey Fellow in U.S. Foreign
Policy and International Security at Dartmouth College. \[Domestic
repression and international aggression? Why Xi is uninterested in

[Crucially, **[diversionary]{.mark} war**]{.underline} theory [rests
on]{.underline} a number of [[assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}, two of
[which [do not hold for Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} today. [Assumption 1:
Leaders prefer foreign adventure over addressing domestic
troubles.]{.underline} As discussed earlier, in the realm of domestic
policies, Xi has been criticized for primarily two things: his promotion
of his cult of personality and a slowing Chinese economy overly focused
on inefficient SOEs. It is easy for Xi to dial back his cult of
personality, and he has already done so. Reverting his policy of guo jin
min tui ("as the state advances, the private sector retreats") is not
going to be easy and would entail important financial system and legal
reforms (see discussions from the 2018 Chinese Economists 50 forum), but
is quite doable. [[There is **little reason**]{.mark} why [Xi would
want]{.mark}]{.underline} to create [**international [tension]{.mark}**
[to distract]{.mark} his [critics when it is]{.mark} **much more
[straightforward]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **directly [address]{.mark}** the
[domestic issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**[a]{.mark}
diversionary [skirmish]{.mark}** involving Vietnam or the Philippines
[over]{.mark}]{.underline} one of [[the **S**]{.underline}]{.mark}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea islands
[[would **hardly be**]{.mark} **significant [enough]{.mark} for
diversion**. [To rally the nation]{.mark} behind him, [Xi must
pick]{.mark} on [Taiwan, Japan, or]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. [The problem
is that]{.underline} a [[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} with either
Taiwan or Japan [[is]{.mark} **highly [risky]{.mark}**[. The]{.mark}
Chinese [military, which has not fought]{.mark} a war
[since]{.mark}]{.underline} the Sino-Vietnamese conflict in [19[79
and]{.mark} is **[embroiled in corruption]{.mark} scandals**,
[might]{.mark} well [suffer defeat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps China
could take on the United States in the economics arena, but [China has
been unable to react effectively to the]{.underline} ongoing [trade
war]{.underline} with the United States. CCP elites do not want
international conflict, especially one involving the United States.
Assumption 2: Key domestic political players want conflict. Most
importantly, [**the CCP [elites]{.mark}** [do not
want]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[conflict]{.mark},
especially]{.underline} one [involving the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. This is not because the CCP elites like the United
States, which is still seen by many as an imperial power that supports
Japanese militarism and secessionism in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and
Xinjiang. However, in Fan's words, [[it is important "to deal
with]{.mark} **domestic [issues]{.mark}** [before]{.mark} **pacifying
[the barbarians]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (an nei rang wai). [In
the eyes of his critics, **any foreign [adventure]{.mark}** [would
indicate]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Xi was getting the]{.mark}
priorities [**wrong** and]{.mark} **further [deviate]{.mark}** [from
**Deng's**]{.mark} **grand [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} of fostering
a favorable foreign environment to promote development. [[A
diversion]{.mark}ary conflict is]{.underline} therefore [likely to
**further [galvanize]{.mark} Xi's [opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
conclusion, the Xi administration's performance since 2012 has been
attacked by a wide range of groups that constitute China's governing
elites; Xi can do little to eliminate rival factions who are waiting for
the opportune moment to strike back. [[Xi is unlikely to be interested
in]{.mark} a foreign [adventure that would]{.mark} at best [distract him
from]{.mark} **domestic [power struggles]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} at
worst [provide more]{.mark} **political [ammunition]{.mark}** [for his
opponents]{.mark}]{.underline} to use against him. [Instead,
[Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[faces]{.mark} **a lot of
[pressure]{.mark}** [to improve]{.mark} **China's [relations with the
U.S.]{.mark}**]{.underline} in his second term, which could help him
deal with his domestic troubles or at least not exacerbate them.

#### Diversionary War Theory is wrong.

**Wang 18** Yaping Wang, Politics PhD Candidate at the University of
Virginia, M.A. at both George Washington University and the National
University of Singapore. \[The Dog That Barks: Understanding Propaganda

The logic of the [[diversion]{.mark}ary argument]{.underline} is
summarized in Figure 2.5. The limitation with this argument is that
[resorting to nationalism]{.underline} for regime legitimacy
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
venture. For one, [[it increases]{.mark} the]{.underline} chance of
[**unwanted [conflicts]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}]{.underline} might
**[eventually [wear off]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the [nationalist
sentiments.]{.mark}]{.underline} The audience cost theory argues that
[[diversions are **too risky**]{.underline}]{.mark} [because [they
**tie**]{.mark} **a government\'s [hands]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Two,
the [[anger]{.underline}]{.mark} of the mass [[might]{.mark} **turn
inward** and **[backfire]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to threaten [regime
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}.100 [**State [leaders are aware of
these]{.mark} risks.** Existing literature]{.underline} on
state-instigated nationalism [has not reached a conclusion on why and
when states would overcome]{.underline} such [trade-offs and
deliberately pursue such a risky policy. Managing
nationalism]{.underline} within control [is]{.underline}, after all, a
[delicate]{.underline} game. Besides, for authoritarian states where
domestic stress is a constant concern and governing legitimacy is always
a valued good given the non- democratic nature of the government, it
remains a puzzle as why stoking nationalism through hiking up
territorial disputes is not a constant effort. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[does not explain why states choose]{.underline} **[some disputes
but not others]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to attract the public
eye]{.underline} for regime consolidation purposes. Despite these
shortcomings, diversionary war theory has often been used to explain
authoritarian international behaviors because of its emphasis on
domestic politics and regime survival at home, which are critical in
understanding authoritarian foreign policy. So it deserves our attention
here.
