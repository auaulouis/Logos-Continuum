**[[There is]{.mark} also [significant democratic backsliding among
NATO]{.mark} member [states]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The cast of
illiberal characters]{.underline}---who are leading the charge in the
wrong direction---[includes the recently reelected and empowered Turkish
President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and
Development Party (AKP), Jaroslaw Kaczynski's [Law and Justice (PiS)
Party in Poland, and Hungarian Prime Minister]{.underline} Viktor Orbán
and the ruling Fidesz Party. [Each has proven more than willing to
repress free media, dismantle checks and balances, demonize political
opposition, clamp down on civil society, and diminish the rule of
law]{.underline}. America's democratic system and norms under President
Trump are also under duress; as a result, Freedom House downgraded the
country's score on the basis of weakening political rights and civil
liberties.

[Despite these alarming developments, NATO leaders have relegated
democratic backsliding to the backburner.]{.underline} Opponents of
making the case for democracy within NATO might argue that pushing
Ankara, Warsaw, and Budapest too hard on their commitments to good
governance will exacerbate already tense divisions in the alliance.
Others might say that Russia would be the prime beneficiary of a
contentious democracy discussion at NATO. Yet [this is a
counterproductive approach with current and potential costs to NATO's
future.]{.underline} [Here are three security-based reasons why the
United States and NATO should care about democratic
backsliding,]{.underline} and actions the alliance can take to address
them.

[1Russia is already benefiting from and effectively leveraging its
relationships with Hungary and Turkey to exacerbate discord within
Europe and NATO.]{.underline} [Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin see one
another as allies]{.underline} in their disdain for the European Union
and Orbán has courted Russian financial and political support as he
builds an illiberal democracy in Hungary. [Russian propaganda also finds
fertile ground in Hungarian media.]{.underline} A 2018 Senate Foreign
Relations Committee report noted that Russian state-owned media content
"by Sputnik and RT is widely referenced by pro-government news sources
in Hungary." The report cited Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive
leader of Putin's worldview and leadership. Acting as the Russian
"camel's nose under the tent," Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's
partnership efforts by blocking the Ukraine-NATO Commission from meeting
at the upcoming summit.

[In Turkey, Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance by pursuing a deal to
purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia. In addition to hurting
NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system is also not
compatible with NATO's defenses.]{.underline} Through arms and energy
deals, **[Putin uses Turkey as a wedge to divide NATO]{.underline}**.
Similarly, [Erdoğan might see his deals with Putin as a way to free
Turkey from Western leverage,]{.underline} particularly as European
states push back on his brand of authoritarian politics by cutting EU
pre-accession funds. After winning the recent twin parliamentary and
presidential elections, **[an emboldened Erdoğan will likely become an
even more problematic partner for NATO.]{.underline}**

[President Putin is building ties with illiberal leaders across Europe
while attacking fundamental elements of Western
democracies.]{.underline}

[Other illiberal and populist governments]{.underline}, [including
Italy's new anti-establishment governmen]{.underline}t, [could follow
suit in enhancing their partnerships with Russia, creating future
intelligence-sharing and cohesion problems for the
alliance.]{.underline} President [**Putin is building ties with
illiberal leaders across Europe while attacking fundamental elements of
Western democracies**, including electoral process and open information
spaces.]{.underline}

**[2There is a strong link between democratic governance and security
gains]{.underline}**. [Liberal democracies have historically been less
likely to experience intra- and interstate conflict, generate refugees,
and harbor violent extremists.]{.underline} [They are also better at
maintaining transparent institutions, civilian control of the military
and intelligence services, and working together on confidence-building
measures, all of which are core features of NATO's ability to
collectively defend its members]{.underline}. On the other hand,
[corruption and insecurity grow under politicized institutions and poor
rule of law.]{.underline} **[This hurts NATO's renewed efforts to combat
terrorism]{.underline}**, as military and security communities have long
acknowledged the connection between corruption and the existence of
criminal networks, traffickers, and terrorists within state borders.

[Corruption also opens space for Russian kleptocratic networks close to
Putin to operate and gain influence]{.underline}. For example, in 2014
Orbán awarded Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company, the sole
contract to build two nuclear plants in Hungary in exchange for a 10
billion euro loan from Moscow. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by
Orbán's Fidesz Party, then passed a rushed vote to keep data from the
nuclear deal confidential for 30 years in the name of "national
security." The deal diminished transparent economic competition within
the European Union and solidified Hungary and Russia's energy ties.

**[3Distrust among allies hurts alliance
interoperability.]{.underline}** [The PiS Party's assault]{.underline}
on independent media and the Constitutional Court, including efforts
last week to summarily force out 27 Polish Supreme Court justices, [have
isolated Poland from France and Germany, diminishing trust among the
European nations. **This could make it increasingly difficult for
Washington to gain consensus on joint decisions, communications, and
operations.**]{.underline} [If NATO is dedicated to building resiliency
along Russia's periphery by placing multi-national battalions in Poland,
then it should not ignore the accountable institutions that would
strengthen this joint effort.]{.underline}

#### A slide to worldwide Digital Authoritarianism is worse than extinction!

Di **Minardi 20** "The grim fate that could be 'worse than extinction',"
BBC Future, 15th October 2020
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201014-totalitarian-world-in-chains-artificial-intelligence//cpd

[Though global totalitarianism is still a niche topic of study,
researchers in the field of existential risk are increasingly turning
their attention to its most likely cause: artificial
intelligence.]{.underline}

In his "[singleton hypothesis",]{.underline} Nick Bostrom, director at
Oxford's FHI[, has explained how a global government could form with AI
or other powerful technologies -- **and why it might be impossible to
overthrow**.]{.underline} He writes that [a world with "a single
decision-making agency at the highest level" could occur if that agency
"obtains a decisive lead through a technological breakthrough in
artificial intelligence or molecular nanotechnology". Once in charge, it
would control advances in technology that prevent internal challenges,
like surveillance or autonomous weapons, and, with this monopoly, remain
perpetually stable.]{.underline}

If the singleton is totalitarian, life would be bleak. Even in the
countries with the strictest regimes, news leaks in and out from other
countries and people can escape[. A global totalitarian rule would
eliminate even these small seeds of hope. **To be worse than extinction,
"that would mean we feel absolutely no freedom, no privacy, no hope of
escaping, no agency to control our lives at all**]{.underline}\", says
Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future of Life Institute in Massachusetts,
which focuses on existential risk research.

["In totalitarian regimes of the past, \[there was\] so much paranoia
and psychological suffering because you just have no idea if you\'re
going to get killed for saying the wrong thing]{.underline}," he
continues. "And now [imagine]{.underline} that there\'s not even a
question, [every single thing you say is being reported and being
analysed."]{.underline}

"We may not yet have the technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent
interview, "but [it looks like the kinds of technologies we're
developing make that easier and easier.]{.underline} And it seems
plausible that this may become possible at some time in the next 100
years."

**[AI and authoritarianism]{.underline}**

Though life under a global totalitarian government is still an unlikely
and far-future scenario, [**AI is already enabling authoritarianism in
some countries** and strengthening infrastructure that could be seized
by an opportunistic despot in others.]{.underline}

"We\'ve seen sort of a reckoning with the shift from very utopian
visions of what technology might bring to much more sobering realities
that are, in some respects, already quite dystopian," says Elsa Kania,
an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, a
bipartisan non-profit that develops national security and defence
policies.

[In the past, surveillance required hundreds of thousands of
people]{.underline} -- one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an
informant -- [but now it can be done by technology.]{.underline} In the
United States, the National Security Agency (NSA) collected hundreds of
millions of American call and text records before they stopped domestic
surveillance in 2019, and there are an estimated four to six million
CCTV cameras across the United Kingdom. Eighteen of the 20 most
surveilled cities in the world are in China, but London is the third.
[The difference between them lies less in the tech that the countries
employ and more in how they use it.]{.underline}

What if the definition of what is illegal in the US and the UK expanded
to include criticising the government or practising certain religions?
The infrastructure is already in place to enforce it, and
[AI]{.underline} -- which the NSA has already begun experimenting with
-- [would enable agencies to search through our data faster than ever
before.]{.underline}

[In addition to enhancing surveillance, AI also underpins the growth of
online misinformation, which is another tool of the
authoritarian]{.underline}. AI-powered deep fakes, which can spread
fabricated political messages, and algorithmic micro-targeting on social
media are making propaganda more persuasive. **[This undermines our
epistemic security]{.underline}** -- the ability to determine what is
true and act on it -- **[that democracies depend on.]{.underline}**

#### Turkey expanding digital authoritarianism into AI greenlights further human rights abuses and anti-democratic control

Unfortunately, in the last decade, [Turkey has garnered international
attention with its violation of free media.]{.underline} As stated in
the literature (Yıldırım, Baruh, and Çarkoğlu 2020), [her track record
in media freedom has been far from perfect since the 1990s]{.underline}.
**[Governments have displayed consistent patterns of restriction and
punishment for opposition]{.underline}** [outlets as well as apparent
favoritism towards pro-government ones.]{.underline} The remaining
content opted for appealing to the relatively stable opposition voter
base. The electoral success of Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve
Kalkınma Partisi - AKP) back in 2002 failed to signal a deviation from
this path in its early years. As 2021 marks their 19th consecutive year
in government, [we can observe a steady increase in media pressure over
AKP's time at the helm of parliament.]{.underline} The key argument of
high political and societal polarization stands (Çarkoğlu, Baruh, and
Yıldırım 2014). In addition, **[another process we must observe is the
democratic backsliding Turkey has experienced over the last two
decades]{.underline}** (Yıldırım, Baruh, and Çarkoğlu 2020).
Indubitably, [consequences of the accelerating authoritarianism are
evident, with Turkey now being dubbed as "the largest prison for
journalists"]{.underline} (Eski 2019). [Turkey, especially the "New
Turkey" Erdoğan declared after the 2011 legislative election victory,
paints an illustrative example of media violations.]{.underline}
Admittedly, Turkey's shortcomings in media freedom precede Erdoğan and
his party. [The media has, notoriously, stayed in line with a multitude
of governments and changed its discourse in accordance.]{.underline}
[Sensitive topics relating to]{.underline} ethnic and religious
[minorities were unanimously avoided.]{.underline} 1980 coup provided a
window of opportunity as the media expressed more diversity thanks to
democratic transition (Bayram 2010). Similar to Latin America (Guerrero
2014), a wave of deregulation in the early 1990s resulted in further
commercialization (Yıldırım, Baruh, and Çarkoğlu 2020) and led to
"captured liberal" media. It is necessary to mention here that the
literature on political communication refers to both direct (or classic)
and indirect censorship (Shadmehr and Bernhardt 2015) over media in its
"captured" aspect. Hence, [with]{.underline} 22 [the direct and indirect
censorship media is now facing, **Turkey's media freedom has hit an
unprecedented low.**]{.underline} The following chapter aims to describe
the process of the Turkish case of digital authoritarianism under AKP's
rule regarding tools and strategies mentioned in the previous section.
Three strategies are essential: media ownership and leverage of
government founded upon crony relationships, censorship and bans on
alternative media, intimidation of its users by abuse of legislative
framework, and lastly, employment of manipulation by trolls and bot
accounts. 3.1 Media Ownership: Creating a Government-Friendly Media
Landscape by Crony Capitalism [As is the case with the general populist
rhetoric, Erdoğan and AKP came to power as challengers to the existing
regime and status quo.]{.underline} As a prominent party figure,
[Erdoğan has explicitly been vocal about his distaste in media since the
beginning, for its being owned by the "elite" and maintaining the status
quo.]{.underline} Another factor of utmost importance in shaping this
attitude was Erdoğan's experience in Refah Partisi (Welfare Party).
Existing media outlets held Erdoğan and RP in a negative light. This was
made evident with the four months imprisonment sentence Erdoğan received
due to reciting a poem in 1997. Media coverage regarding the
adjudication showed apparent enthusiasm about the unfolding of events,
with the most memorable headline being "He will not be able to become
even a headman" (Radikal 1998). This headline became a central piece of
Erdoğan's populist rhetoric in underlining "the people's" triumph over
the preceding regime in later years. In combination, the two motives
mentioned above propelled AKP and Erdoğan to replace the media with a
pro-government one. Control over traditional media has set the stage for
AKP's digital authoritarianism. [As the media became tied to
conglomerates owning several pro-AKP outlets, said outlets' news sites
became a projection of their traditional counterparts. In]{.underline}
[tandem with the increasing control, 'professional' digital media became
dominantly in favor of the government]{.underline}. 23 Figure 3.1
Democracy Index Scores DemocracyIndexOverallScore **[Turkey's descend
into competitive authoritarianism came gradually.]{.underline}** As
Figure 11 shows, it is not unique in this aspect that each of the four
countries mentioned throughout this thesis has experienced a slight but
consistent decrease in their democracy scores over the last fourteen
years. [AKP's media control was no different, a 'patient struggle'
against the conventional media]{.underline} (Aladağ 2013). Between 2014
and 2018, [the asymmetry in media ownership in pro-government and
opposition was made official. This clear government bias was the
consequence of a series of changes that took place since
2002.]{.underline} By buying outlets and shifting ownership to
businessmen with close ties to the government, AKP has laid the ground
for what came to be called havuz medyası by its opposition.

#### Hungary's digital authoritarianism creates positive feedback loops of democratic backsliding 

Fatma **Timucin** 07-08- **21,** "8-BIT IRON FIST: DIGITAL
AUTHORITARIANISM IN COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES: THE CASES OF
TURKEY AND HUNGARY", 8 July 21,
https://research.sabanciuniv.edu/id/eprint/42417/1/10337574.pdf//cpd

The case of Hungary has garnered recent scholarly attention regarding
its democratic trajectory in the latest years. [As 2021 marks Victor
Orbán's eleventh year holding the position of Prime Minister, **Hungary
has turned increasingly authoritarian**]{.underline}. The country has
accomplished an unfortunate first, as it is the only non-democratic
member of the EU since 2020 (Repucci 2020). [In turn, several NGOs,
international organizations, and member countries have issued demands of
political sanctions on Hungary in an attempt to reverse the democratic
backsliding it is facing]{.underline}. **[Orbán's regime can be
characterized by populism and national conservatism]{.underline}**. As a
distinguishing quality, [Orbán openly advocates for an 'illiberal state'
in advancing national conservatism.]{.underline} His shift to right-wing
became apparent in his first term in office between 1998-2002. Following
two elections favored the Socialist Party, resulting in a drastic change
in the government. However, Orbán's Fidesz managed to keep its
popularity in later years, and coupled with the Socialist's decreasing
voter support, won the election by a landslide in 2010. The subsequent
decade has solidified Orbán's grip on power as Fidesz constituted the
majority in the parliament after his coalition with Christian Democrats.
This allowed Orbán to pass several constitutional and legislative
reforms. The consequences of said reforms spell out a perfect example of
the "executive aggrandizement" (Bermeo 2016) pointed out in democratic
backsliding literature. Simultaneously, Orbán expanded his influence,
blurred the boundaries of executive decision-making, and grasped the
popular vote. His maintaining of popular support is linked to several
causes in the literature, such as the weak democratic tradition as a
result of the post-soviet context (Krygier 2019), deepening of social
cleavages (Palonen 2009), and rising Euro-scepticism resulting from a
clash of values (Furedi 2017). [An overlooked factor of Orbán's success
lies in his gradual capture of the media network, resulting in an
enormous asymmetry in pro-government and opposition
narratives.]{.underline} Although recent scholarly work aimed to fill
the gap in the literature (Fabry 2020; Serdült 2020; Zgut et al. 2020),
the issue was raised only after Hungary became a competitive
authoritarian regime. 41 An extensive recollection of Orbán's attitude
towards media is hard to come by. In contrast, with many of his populist
counterparts, Victor [Orbán openly targeted free media since he assumed
office. Independent media outlets shrank in numbers and the variety of
content they can offer over time. In his crusade against opposition
voices, Orbán instrumentalized takeovers as well as restriction and
persecution of journalists.]{.underline} One of the last remaining
independent media outlets, Index.hu, was met with a change of staff on
the grounds of political motivation (Index 2020) in Fall 2020. Calls for
the EU to intervene and protect freedom of speech through political
pressure were made (IPI 2020), although there is no action taken
insofar. [In building control over the media, the case of Hungary was
specifically successful for its implementation of all three strategies
at once]{.underline}: legislative action, financial manipulation, and
political pressure (Altena 2017); and the organizational grasp of Fidesz
**[and Orbán resulted in perpetual democratic backsliding]{.underline}**
where linkage and leverage to EU fell short (Sandoval 2018). The
following chapter offers a breakdown of the building and practice of
Victor Orbán's strategies of digital authoritarianism[. The case of
Orbán's digital authoritarianism is a valuable contribution to
literature in showing the solidification of an increasingly aggressive
pro-government media landscape.]{.underline} [Systematic violation of
freedom of speech aids populist leaders like Orbán in spreading and
legitimizing their rhetoric as the one and only 'truth.']{.underline}
[Diminishing]{.underline} opportunities in accessing alternative
[sources of information further contributes to democratic backsliding
and creates a positive feedback loop,]{.underline} which is why it is
worthy of scholarly attention with regards to both digital
authoritarianism and populism literatures.

### 2nc -- democracy backsliding 

#### Turkey's anti-democratic government decks NATO credibility and risks US security 

Michael **Poznansky**, 10-13-20**16**, \"NATO members are supposed to be
democratic. What happens when Turkey isn't?,\" Washington Post,

[A core principle of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is
that member states adhere to democratic values. So what happens now that
**Turkey**, a longtime NATO member, **has suspended a number of legal
protections** in the weeks and months following the July 15 coup
attempt?]{.underline}

Immediately after part of the military tried to overthrow his
government, [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan retaliated with a
widespread purge of large numbers of police officers, judges and
soldiers. By late July, the Turkish government's crackdown had extended
to the private financial sector, as well as the country's universities.
The government detained as many as 50,000 in what one news report called
"the biggest purge in Turkey's modern history."]{.underline}

How **[Erdogan's anti-democratic government made Turkey ripe for
unrest]{.underline}**

[Turkey's ties with the West are strained]{.underline}

As discussed here in the Monkey Cage, [Erdogan met with Russian
President Vladimir Putin in early August after criticizing the
U.S.-European response to the coup.]{.underline} [**That Erdogan sought
closer ties with Putin is a remarkable outcome** in light of the fact
that Turkey and Russia have been at loggerheads over Syria.]{.underline}

**[From Turkey's perspective, NATO and the West may have "failed the
solidarity test"]{.underline}** [by offering Erdogan little reassurance
after the coup attempt.]{.underline} Washington, for instance, made no
promise to grant Turkey's extradition request for Fethullah Gulen, the
U.S.-based Turkish cleric who Erdogan claims was the coup's mastermind.
AWhile the two nations have been cooperating in the ongoing fight
against the Islamic State, **[significant tensions
remain.]{.underline}**

Why [it's good for dictators to have dictator friends]{.underline}

[These recent developments]{.underline} --- and years of creeping
authoritarianism by Erdogan and his AKP party --- [have led some foreign
policy analysts to call for Turkey's expulsion from NATO.]{.underline}

Doug Bandow at the Cato Institute called for a "civil divorce," noting
that "**[As Ankara moves toward an authoritarian one-party state, its
membership in NATO becomes ever more incongruous]{.underline}**."

Another Cato scholar, Ted Galen Carpenter, last year wrote that "[NATO
is supposed to be an alliance of peaceful democracies. Yet evidence
continues to mount that **Turkey fails to meet \[that\]
standard."**]{.underline} More recently, Carpenter wrote, "[**Does
America really want to risk its security to protect such allies**,
especially when it purports to lead an alliance of enlightened
democracies]{.underline}?"

Upholding NATO's Democratic Values

[NATO is struggling to confront a potentially cancerous threat from
within. Three allied governments---Poland, Hungary and Turkey---have
undermined their own democracies in varying degrees by suppressing free
speech and a free press and limiting the independence of the
courts]{.underline}.13 As NATO is, first and foremost, an alliance of
democracies, [**the actions of these governments threaten the core
values**---democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law]{.underline}---to which each ally is committed in the North Atlantic
Treaty.

Nearly every current and former NATO official with whom we talked for
this report worried that [a recommendation for NATO to discipline these
anti-democratic governments would be highly problematic and
divisive.]{.underline} Nonetheless, we believe [NATO must find a way to
shine a light on these recalcitrant allies]{.underline}. For example,
NATO could review annually each ally's democratic practices, perhaps in
a report prepared by a high-level, outside group. [Allies that violate
basic democratic standards could be suspended from NATO military
exercises or denied access to NATO training and common infrastructure
funding.]{.underline}

More than one European mentioned to us the ironic fact that the U.S.
itself may be chastised for a deterioration of its own democratic
standards in such a process. [Nevertheless, **ignoring this challenge of
democratic principles will undermine the core convictions that brought
NATO together** seventy years ago.]{.underline}

accessed 6-21-2022//cpd

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is facing an internal
problem that could permanently weaken the Alliance.]{.underline} In
recent years[, we have seen the rise of a nationalist-populist wave in
Europe and the United States]{.underline}: Viktor Orbán of Hungary, the
Kaczynski in Poland, and President Donald Trump in America. **[This rise
in illiberal world leaders has led to significant democratic backsliding
in NATO countries, which pose a grave threat to NATO's strength in the
face of an aggressive and revisionist Russia.]{.underline}**

[How is Democratic Backsliding Affecting the Alliance?]{.underline}

Democratic governance and strong institutions are as much a cornerstone
of the Alliance as is collective defense. [Article II]{.underline} of
the North Atlantic Treaty (also known as the Washington Treaty[)
stresses the importance of "states' promises to strengthen free
institutions within their borders," underscoring the vital democratic
aspects of the alliance. Within NATO today, however, some states are
shifting away from the core tenets of Article II and are actively
conspiring to undermine the same institutional channels that brought
them to power. **These regressions of democracy create vulnerabilities
that can be exploited by NATO adversaries, namely the
Kremlin.**]{.underline}

In [Hungary]{.underline}, Orbán's increasingly authoritarian Fidesz
government [has taken an increasingly pro-Russia stance,]{.underline}
doling out energy contracts to the country's oligarchs and calling for
Hungary to model itself a similarly to Russia's illiberal state. In
[Turkey]{.underline}, the rise of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has resulted in
members of the military being sacked and indiscriminate jailing of
journalists and academics, while leaving no real opposition to his rule.
This in turn [has led to closer ties between Ankara and Moscow,
especially in matters of defense]{.underline} and the ongoing Syrian
civil war. [Poland continues to see Russia as both an adversary and a
threat]{.underline}; however, Poland's judiciary reform has effectively
turned the high court into a PiS puppet while media repression has
simultaneously turned Poland into both a victim and purveyor of
disinformation campaigns, further isolating it from its allies and
European partners. [**Democratic backsliding and increased illiberal
leaders in NATO countries have opened the door for Russia to engage in
an influence campaign**, and to pull those countries away from the
Liberal Western Order the Alliance is founded on.]{.underline}

[Democratic backsliding weakens NATO internally by making cohesion,
trust, and operations more difficult.]{.underline} [Democracies tend to
foster cooperation and trust; autocracies are always looking to blame
"the other."]{.underline} Within NATO, **[we are seeing bigger wedges
being driven into member states,]{.underline}** [as illiberal regimes
criticize their democratic allies, and democracies sanction
authoritarian actions.]{.underline} Germany and the EU have become
targets of the right-wing populist Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS/Law and
Justice) government in Poland. [The current government has sought to
expunge any guilt the "Polish Nation" incurred during the Second World
War by engaging in an aggressive revisionist campaign aimed at denying
Poland's participation in Nazi death camps.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [Poland's attempt to sack its Constitutional
Court]{.underline} and replace 27 justices with PiS loyalists [has
alienated it from France, Germany, and the European Commission, which
opened an Article 7 investigation last year into Poland's actions and is
currently threatening to take legal action against it.]{.underline}
Likewise, [Hungary has taken an antagonistic stance with EU members and
their efforts to promote rule of law.]{.underline} Budapest has been in
an entrenched battle against the EU, in what Orbán has called "liberal
forces acting against Central and Eastern European countries," while
actively opposing and restraining EU laws on immigration, entertaining
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and curtailing individual freedoms
within Hungary's borders. [**The right-wing populism of both Poland and
Hungary,** with their villainization of minorities, suppression of
dissent, crackdown on civil society, and erosion of democratic norms and
institutions, **puts them at odds with their NATO allies and EU
partners, fostering uncertainty and deep mistrust among
them.**]{.underline}

Challenges from Within NATO

Reviving American Leadership of the Alliance

[**NATO's single greatest challenge is the absence of strong, principled
American presidential leadership** for the first time in its
history.]{.underline} President Donald Trump is regarded widely in NATO
capitals as the Alliance's most urgent, and often most difficult,
problem. [NATO leaders, for example, considered not holding a 2019
summit to mark the seventieth anniversary this spring as they did in
decades past]{.underline}. They feared President Trump would blow up a
meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO
leaders during the past two years. Wary of his past behavior, NATO plans
a scaled down leaders meeting for December 2019.

[**President Trump's open ambivalence about NATO's value to the U.S.**,
his public questioning of America's Article 5 commitment to its allies,
persistent criticism of Europe's democratic leaders and embrace of its
anti-democratic members and continued weakness in failing to confront
NATO's primary adversary President Vladimir Putin of Russia, **have
hurtled the Alliance into its most worrisome crisis in
memory**.]{.underline}3

There is no reason to believe President Trump's attitude will change for
the better during the next two years. He believes NATO allies are taking
advantage of the U.S.4 These are the same allies and partners who came
to America's defense on 9/11, suffered more than 1,000 battlefield
deaths alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan,5 are fighting with
the U.S. now against the Islamic State and shoulder the main burden
sustaining a fragile peace in the Balkans, in both Kosovo and Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

[President Trump is the first U.S. president to view the European Union
as an economic competitor rather than a vital partner of both the U.S.
and NATO]{.underline}. [**His troubling anti-NATO and anti-Europe bias
has caused European governments to question the credibility of the
U.S.** as the leader of the West for the first time since the Second
World War]{.underline}.6 The European public confidence in American
leadership is also at historically low depths.7 Every American president
before Trump has encouraged the strength and unity of Europe as a core
interest of the U.S. [Trump may well cause even greater damage to the
Alliance while he remains in office.]{.underline}

For this reason, Republicans and Democrats in [Congress must act
together as a blocking force against President Trump's dangerous
policies.]{.underline} Congress, on a bipartisan basis, should reaffirm
the U.S. commitment to the Article 5 defense clause in the NATO Treaty.
Congress should pass legislation this year requiring Congressional
approval should President Trump attempt to alter U.S. treaty commitments
to NATO allies or to have the U.S. leave the Alliance altogether.8
Congress should continue to fund the "European Deterrence Initiative" to
bolster U.S. military strength in Europe that is the primary deterrent
against Russian adventurism.

New Low in Relations Risks Paralyzing NATO,\" War on the Rocks,

accessed 6-23-2022//cpd

[NATO's most important challenge today may not come from Russia, but
from within. With the number of disputes between Turkey and several
European allies yet again on the rise, the two parties' souring
relations have begun undermining the organization's cohesion and ability
to make timely collective decisions.]{.underline} If left unaddressed,
[these tensions could cause serious damage to the world's most powerful
alliance.]{.underline}

[The latest flashpoint came from Turkey's open backing of
Azerbaijan]{.underline}'s war effort in the small landlocked enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended abruptly in early November [thanks to a
Russian-brokered deal.]{.underline} Reports of military assistance and
alleged Syrian mercenaries sent by Turkey placed Ankara at loggerheads
with its NATO allies' calls for a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the
conflict. The deal, which foresees Baku reacquiring sizeable portions of
the disputed enclave, has made Turkey one of the obvious winners of the
recent flare-up, while its Western allies remain on the sidelines. For
some, this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, adding to a
long list of complaints they have recently leveled against their NATO
ally.

BECOME A MEMBER

Last month, [Greece and Turkey came dangerously close to a head-on naval
confrontation]{.underline} in disputed Eastern Mediterranean waters
[over Turkey's gas exploration activities]{.underline} near the Greek
island of Kastellorizo, just a few hundred meters away from the Turkish
coast. Though Turkey later withdrew its ship, [tensions between the two
NATO allies spiked again following Turkey's announcement that it would
send the ship back for a 10-day seismic research mission in the
area]{.underline}, renewing Greek calls for sanctions. [What makes this
a particularly explosive situation, of course, is the two Eastern
Mediterranean powers' lingering dispute over the post-1974 division of
Cyprus and the discovery of energy resources in the area.]{.underline}

[A similar confrontational encounter occurred in June when France and
Turkey nearly came to blows after a French warship]{.underline}, the
Courbet, tried to inspect a Turkish vessel for allegedly breaching a
U.N. arms embargo on Libya --- a claim Ankara fiercely denies.
[Supporting different sides in the Libyan Civil War, the two allies have
been engaged in a war of words]{.underline} over each other's
provocative deeds in the Libyan, Syrian and Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts,
[as well as over Turkey's territorial claims in the
Mediterranean.]{.underline} The latest spat followed President Emmanuel
Macron's defense of a cartoonist's right to caricature religious figures
in the wake of a teacher's beheading, to which Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan responded by calling for a boycott of French products.

[Within NATO, the escalation in tensions and growing entanglement of the
two camps' now numerous disputes reflects European allies' mounting
frustration over what they perceive as Turkey's self-serving and
aggressive regional posturing, and its unwillingness to consult allies
before acting.]{.underline} A NATO member since 1952, [Turkey has always
occupied a somewhat unique role in the alliance]{.underline}. Its size,
military resources, and key position at the doorstep of Asia --- in
other words, as NATO's southern flank --- give it important strategic
relevance within the context of renewed interest in the Middle East.
Though relations have often been fragile, especially since the 2016 coup
attempt, **[the current rift marks a new low in the recent history of
the alliance, with potentially damaging consequences]{.underline}**.
Given this backdrop, [NATO should take advantage of its own resources to
try to address its members' deteriorating relations, and work to
reconcile their diverging security interests.]{.underline} This is a lot
easier said than done, but it may be the only option to prevent a more
fundamental rupture in the relationship.

Divided We Stan

As tensions grow, [a key risk for NATO relates to the crisis' potential
to hamper its cohesion and ability to act decisively]{.underline}, as
the alliance relies on the principle of consensus to successfully
operate. **[Every major NATO decision embodies the collective will of
all allies and results]{.underline}**, therefore[, from a complex but
fragile process of negotiation wherein nations are invited to compromise
on matters of mutual interest]{.underline}. The inevitable drawback to
this is that every ally possesses a de facto right to veto any NATO
issue if its demands are not met, which they may be incentivized to use
as leverage to pursue national interests. The same can be said of the
European Union, which operates on unanimity and where Cyprus recently
made headlines for blocking sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko's regime, insisting on the imposition of E.U. measures on
Turkey for its energy exploration in Mediterranean waters. The European
Union was criticized for failing to agree on timely sanctions.

Unlike the European Union, NATO consultations are held behind closed
doors, and disagreements largely avoid public scrutiny. In principle,
however, any nation's objections could stall key alliance policy or
business. Last [year, leaks revealed that Turkey had threatened on the
eve of a NATO summit to block a key defense plan to protect the Baltic
states and Poland against Russian aggression unless NATO backed its own
recognition of the Kurdish People's Protection Units militia as
terrorists]{.underline}. Likewise, for years, [Turkey had vetoed NATO
cooperation with neutral Austria under its partnership program in
response to Vienna's calls for the European Union to halt membership
talks with Ankara.]{.underline} Though in both cases deals were
eventually reached to break the deadlock, and though such negotiation
tactics are not uncommon, **[these incidents highlight a mounting
climate of uncooperativeness and unwillingness to compromise between
allies, making interaction increasingly difficult.]{.underline}**

As Ankara grows more defiant, [NATO members are indeed finding it
difficult to reign in their southeastern ally.]{.underline} With the
2011 Arab Spring and its aftermath, [the rapid deterioration of Turkey's
regional and domestic security environments has coincided with a growing
perception that its Western allies are not giving enough credence to its
core security interests.]{.underline} The stalled European Union
membership project, together with America's disengagement from the
Middle East, support for the Kurdish People's Protection Units militia,
and persistent refusal to extradite cleric Fethullah Gülen, the presumed
mastermind of the failed 2016 coup attempt, have all contributed to
strengthening the conviction that Turkish security interests are likely
best served through autonomous action --- and not by relying on a
suspicious and divided West. This impression is reinforced by Europe's
vocal criticism of Erdoğan's concentration of executive power, and by
the country's worsening economic and social woes.

Overall, [these factors have eroded NATO's credibility and influence
over Ankara, just as the latter has become more conscious of its own
considerable leverage over Europe due to its key role in Syria, which
NATO sees as the defense of its southern frontier, and in easing the
pressure to accommodate large arrivals of refugees on European
shores.]{.underline} The former is linked to Turkey's vetoing of NATO's
defense plan for Poland and the Baltics, which aimed at compelling NATO
to provide greater support in Turkey's defense of the alliance's
southern flank --- something Ankara has demanded for years. Likewise,
Turkey's handling of its four million-strong refugee population, the
largest in the world, has contributed to Ankara's influence over
Brussels through its instrumentalization of fears that it would "open
the gates" to Europe for migrants and refugees, which Erdoğan announced
earlier this year in violation of a 2016 E.U.-Turkish agreement. Given
its shrewd sense that the tables have turned, **[Ankara has lost many
incentives to cooperate.]{.underline}** Of course[, one key risk is that
Turkey's bold strategy backfires and leads to a fresh round of
retaliatory measures such as collective sanctions or cutbacks in E.U.
funds, with damaging effects on Turkey's weakening economy.]{.underline}

[For NATO, another conceivable consequence lays in the reinforcement of
calls for greater European "strategic autonomy" in the realms of defense
and security, with potentially harmful repercussions on the future of
the transatlantic community.]{.underline} Against a backdrop of
deteriorating Euro-Atlantic relations, **[several leaders have begun to
publicly question the relevance and effectiveness of NATO as an
organization]{.underline}**. A staunch advocate of the "strategic
autonomy" concept, [Macron reacted to the clash with Turkey over the
arms embargo on Libya by reiterating his assertion that NATO was "brain
dead" for being unable to temper Turkish adventurism]{.underline}. In a
recent interview, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian echoed these
remarks by [putting at stake NATO's credibility over the organization's
seeming inability to influence its member's involvement in the
Caucasus.]{.underline} Were NATO to become increasingly paralyzed by
souring internal relations, [doubts about the effectiveness and
reliability of the organization could further incentivize E.U. countries
into acting beyond the NATO framework. Regrettably, this could result in
accelerating E.U. states' ostracizing of Ankara, while persuading some
allies into seeking additional bilateral arrangements as more reliable
forms of security guarantees.]{.underline}

[E.U.-Turkish tensions have also brought to the fore Ankara's ambiguous
ties to Moscow.]{.underline} Though relations hit rock bottom over the
downing of a Russian Su-24M fighter jet in 2015, [the two countries have
since rebuilt extensive political and economic ties, culminating with
high-profile endeavors such as the TurkStream pipeline and Ankara's 2017
purchase of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense
system.]{.underline} The moves drew stern condemnation from Washington
and other NATO allies, with some going as far as to [label them as signs
of a Turkish pivot to the East.]{.underline} What made this
rapprochement all the more alarming were the two countries' ostensible
affinities over their highly centralized, authoritarian-leaning
political systems, which run counter to the core values of the alliance.
[**The main fear is that these newfound affinities introduce
vulnerabilities within the alliance** through bilateral ties that Moscow
can exploit to **drive Turkey further away from the West, and sow
division to weaken NATO's ability to act.**]{.underline}

Kalin said Turkey's proposal to lift arms export limits was met with a
"positive attitude" by the Swedish and Finnish delegations. [He added
that talks would continue once the Nordic governments had responded to
Turkey's demands.]{.underline} [Turkey also expects the extradition of
28 "terrorism" suspects from Sweden and 12 from Finland, Kalin said,
adding that there was "no legal or judicial basis" not to extradite
them. Turkish state media had previously said Turkey demanded the
extradition of 33 suspects from the two countries.]{.underline} Swedish

European Council President Charles Michel in [Stockholm]{.underline}
that her country [wanted to "clarify" claims that have been floating
around during discussions with Turkey.]{.underline} "We do not send
money or weapons to terrorist organizations," Andersson said. During a
news conference with the Estonian prime minister later Wednesday,
Andersson said that "in these times, it is important to strengthen our
security." She said Sweden has "a constructive dialogue" with Turkey and
that Stockholm was "eager to sort out issues and misunderstandings and
questions." Michel, who is scheduled to head to Helsinki from Stockholm,
said it was "a pivotal moment for Sweden\" and "we fully support your
choices." [Turkey this week listed five "concrete assurances" it was

political support for terrorism," an "elimination of the source of
terrorism financing," and the "cessation of arms support" to the banned
PKK and a Syrian Kurdish militia group affiliated with it.]{.underline}
**[The demands also called for the lifting of arms sanctions against

Private firms worldwide legally or illegally have long been selling
dual-use digital technologies that can be used to monitor web traffic
and to censor information. [That there is a global market for digital
surveillance tools is old news.]{.underline} Companies incorporated in
democracies heavily export these dual-use technologies worldwide,
including, in many documented cases, to despots.\[12\] [Likewise,
**companies incorporated in autocracies sell dual-use technologies,
including those that can be used for censorship** and surveillance, to
other authoritarian regimes.]{.underline}\[13\] Some studies suggest
that democracies account for a far greater volume of surveillance
technology exports, including to despots, despite attempts to restrict
such exports.\[14\] **[The pursuit of digital authoritarianism to
bolster state power magnifies incentives for some countries to acquire
dual-use surveillance tools, and for others to encourage their
spread]{.underline}**. [China's state leadership, for instance,
consistently has advocated a sovereign and controlled Internet
governance model on the global stage, with practices like censorship and
surveillance, as opposed to a global and open model supported by many
liberal democracies]{.underline}.\[15\] In tandem with this global
diplomatic messaging, the Chinese government has reportedly conducted
trainings on new media or information management with representatives
from dozens of countries, many on record as pursuing restrictive online
practices.\[16\] This has coincided with countries targeted by the Belt
and Road Initiative passing cybersecurity laws that sometimes mirror
laws already enacted in China, such as Vietnam's recent establishment of
data localization requirements.\[17\] Causality remains unclear in this
situation, and [empirical questions remain to be answered about the
underlying drivers of digital authoritarianism in different
countries.]{.underline} Nonetheless, [**these patterns and events,
coupled with exports of surveillance technologies from China, raise
questions about Beijing's intentions to spread digital authoritarianism
globally, including through a greater focus on, and/or endorsement of,
the sale of digital surveillance and control capabilities.** This could
amplify the aforementioned national security risks, should authoritarian
countries acquire the tools and/or knowledge needed to bolster their
power through digital surveillance.]{.underline} National security
analysts have already flagged these potential risks across Africa. Many
countries [China has engaged with through its Belt and Road investments
have acquired Chinese surveillance technology, potentially usable for
oppressive purposes. For instance, Chinese company exports of
surveillance technology to the Ethiopian government have occurred
alongside Chinese government investments.]{.underline}\[18\] Given
China's history of spying on and suppressing political dissidents, this
is hardly a benign fact, and Ethiopia is but one of several examples.
[**Should China's leadership be intent on spreading digital
authoritarianism worldwide, to include diffusion of surveillance tools,
this likely could include countries aligned with China's national
security and/or economic interests.** Like China, Russia has long
advocated for cyber sovereignty on the international
stage,]{.underline}\[19\] with President Vladimir [Putin repeatedly
emphasizing the importance of information control within a country's
sovereign borders.]{.underline}\[20\] As noted above, Russian companies
export surveillance and hacking technologies, especially to post-Soviet
states.\[21\] Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan actually suggest that
Russian surveillance technology exports to some of these countries are a
better fit than Western-made surveillance applications, because Russian
laws and procedures governing traffic interception are more compatible
for these countries, and the technologies are tailored
accordingly.\[22\] In either case, these surveillance technology exports
need further study, and they clearly serve as tools of political
influence in Russia's near-abroad. [As with China, the extent of the
Russian government's direct involvement in and support of such exports
needs further study, because the Kremlin's direct hand in these exports,
while visible, is hardly transparent.]{.underline} [The desire to spread
digital authoritarianism may well incentivize the Kremlin to better
spread its surveillance technologies, or to at least look the other way
when they occur, and thereby consolidate power in the hands of
Russian-aligned countries at the expense of US government
interests.]{.underline} **[This also could threaten vulnerable
democracies worldwide, and facilitate the so-called fracturing of the
global Internet, as countries build out technical and legal regimes that
filter the global and open Internet touching and running through their
borders.\[]{.underline}**23\] [Again, the threat here is not only from
governments in China and Russia.]{.underline} Companies incorporated in
democracies also sell a high volume of dual-use surveillance
technologies to despots, and this is something we are better able to
monitor and correct. It is also important to reemphasize the existing
incentives for countries to encourage or allow the spread of these
capabilities to other countries (including the technologies and how to
optimize them). **[But growing desires to spread digital
authoritarianism globally not only undermine human rights and developing
democracies; this also exposes US national security to increased
risk.]{.underline}**

The Four Horsemen of the **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense[**'s** Looming **[AI
Winter]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The four horsemen of the forthcoming AI apocalypse, so to speak,
[are]{.underline} this time [around]{.underline} human [problems
with]{.underline}out technological scapegoats. They are a [lack of **AI
expertise**, [too much]{.mark} **AI [bureaucracy]{.mark}**, the
challenge of **democratizing AI** to the user level, and an
**old-fashioned approach** to AI integration]{.underline}.

Domain Expertise: The Education Challenge

[To become an AI force, the **[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
[[should **inculcate**]{.mark} AI **domain [expertise]{.mark}** at
**appropriate levels** of **leadership** --- [with]{.mark} the
**[warfighters]{.mark}** who employ AI, **[not
bureaucrats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Creating a curriculum for AI within
enlisted and officer professional military education should be a
priority. The curriculum should include a breakdown of the core
components of an AI pipeline --- data, computing, algorithm development,
test/evaluation, and AI-enabled platforms.

Commanders and their staff should have AI Smartcards, a rubric for
exercising domain expertise, at the ready. First introduced in February
2021, the smartcard is structured into six main categories corresponding
to the core functionality comprising an AI system. The smartcard is a
framework for curriculum, both readily adaptable for professional
military education learning modules and unit-level adoption. Not simply
a technical guide, the AI Smartcard also helps the unit to think through
operationalizing AI and becoming "AI-ready."

An indicator that the scales are being rebalanced will be warfighters
peppering AI subject matter experts with questions that get to the heart
of the smartcard --- is real AI being delivered? When slick briefings
full of drive-by tech-splanations of AI capability evolve into a user
asking penetrating questions to get the heart of AI performance, then
the expertise obstacle will have been overcome.

Bureaucracy: The Management Challenge

Bureaucracy can be a beautiful thing --- structure, talent, mission, and
resources coming together in a cohesive, logical manner to deliver
mission-critical capabilities. With that said,
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[[bureaucracies]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
a way of **[[calcify]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[around programs]{.mark}
and people, [not]{.mark} actual **[capabilities]{.mark}**. The
consequence of the **AI bureaucracy** --- which consists of several
**one-off groups** organized around the task of bringing AI to the
department, but which are stovepiped away from the people they're
actually trying to buy AI for --- is an [**unnecessary buffer**
between]{.mark} **users** and **developers**. This **convoluted system**
confuses]{.underline} what should be [a **[direct feedback]{.mark}
loop** [to ensure]{.mark} that [**capabilities** are]{.mark} **acutely
[focused]{.mark}** [on **mission-critical
requirements**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [department should shrink centralized groups]{.mark}]{.underline}
like the **[J]{.underline}**oint **[AI C]{.underline}**enter
[and]{.underline} the [Army Futures Command AI Task Force
and]{.underline} instead [send their **authorities**, **decision-making
power**, and **resources** down to **operational units**]{.underline}.
AI centers of excellence should be [creating processes, policies, and
[resourcing]{.mark} to facilitate a constant [**feedback loop** between
**user** and **developer**, with no-one]{.mark} in between [to
**garble**]{.mark} the **[message]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They should
exist as idea-centric organizations at the service level that cut across
the warfighting functions, providing the tools, lessons learned,
resources, and expertise to [help]{.mark} **commanders** to
**[operationalize AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The bureaucracy
should connect intent, constraints and restraints, and resources --- and
then get out of the way.

The Department of Defense's managing philosophy with respect to AI
bureaucracy should mirror the computer programming concept called the
"self-deleting executable." It is a string of code designed to allow a
program to delete itself. [[Instead of]{.mark} thinking in terms of
[**hiring** hundreds of **pseudo-experts**]{.mark}, think in terms
of]{.underline} creating an organization and then setting an egg timer
for it to expand and contract, responsive to [a **direct**
**user-developer** **feedback loop**.]{.underline} The [AI
bureaucracy]{.underline} only survives as a platform to connect users
with development talent, contracting, and computing power. It [should
**shrink**]{.underline}, not expand, over time.

#### Pilot projects prevent [AI integration]{.underline} at scale -- [no robust pipeline]{.underline} for [innovation]{.underline} -- AND, ties [cost estimates]{.underline} to [legacy systems]{.underline} which consolidates [bureaucratic centralization]{.underline} and guarantees [AI failure]{.underline}

These [assumptions]{.mark} were **[ill-conceived]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

realized the [[one-by-one]{.mark} "AI decision aids" are "single point

The [21st century]{.underline} has [ushered]{.underline} in an era of
[intense **tech**]{.underline}nological **[advancement]{.underline}**,
changing the character of warfare. [**Hypersonic** weapons,
**autonomous** platforms, ubiquitous sensors, **big data**, quantum
science, additive manufacturing, and **[a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence are]{.underline} but a few of the
technological developments [[changing]{.underline}]{.mark} the landscape
of the world and **[[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we know it. The
conduct of warfare, from its fundamental principles to ethical
framework, is being challenged.

As [state and non-state actors]{.underline} alike [strive for
overmatch]{.underline} in this technological arms race, the West, namely
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
along with its fellow **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** allies, currently
[[possesses]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**human [resources]{.mark}**
required [to]{.mark} develop, maintain, and hone
[overmatch]{.mark}]{.underline} at all levels of warfare. [The West can
ensure **intellectual overmatch** [by fostering]{.mark} a **culture** of
**[decentralized decision making]{.mark}** where a relationship of
**trust** and **mutual understanding** exists between leaders at all
levels.]{.underline} It is based upon understanding "intent" and where
the [encouragement of **subordinate-driven** initiative and
**decentralized decision making** at all levels is
expected]{.underline}.

This [requires]{.underline} a [revolution in thinking, a **paradigm
shift** **[institutionalized]{.mark}** across the **NATO**
enterprise]{.underline}. Change must occur across our institutions from
our entry training to our career professional development and unit
certification processes. [A culture of kinship, trust, and mutual
respect among leaders at all levels needs to be revitalized. If NATO can
do this, true **[primacy]{.mark}** will be gained at all levels of
**warfare** [resulting in **speed**]{.mark}, **[tempo]{.mark}**, and
**battlefield [lethality]{.mark}** far **[surpassing]{.mark}** our
**[adversaries]{.mark}**. As the **[DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}---namely
the **[Marine Corps]{.underline}**--- [[approaches]{.mark} **capacity**
and [**alliance building** throughout the **Asia
Pacific**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this same [developmental calculus must
be considered]{.underline}. Time, space, and disaggregated
[operations]{.underline} throughout this region [will require
**decentralized decision making**]{.underline} of the highest order.
Long standing partnership such as Australia will be well suited to make
this paradigm shift; however, [**emerging security partners**, such as
**Vietnam** and **India** will require **substantial assistance** in
**tech**]{.underline}nological [**development** and
**mindset**]{.underline}.

The Battlefield of the Future

[Future [battlefields will be]{.mark} volatile, uncertain, complex, and
ambiguous]{.underline} (**[[VUCA]{.underline}]{.mark}**).3 They will be
**[trans-regional]{.underline}**, [**multi-functional**, and
**multi-dimensional**, requiring enhanced joint
**interoperability**]{.underline} well inside the adversaries' weapons
engagement zone.4 [**Communications** will be **degraded**]{.underline},
the massing of any [assets or personnel will be **costly**, and all
**[domains]{.mark}**, **air**, **land**, **sea**, **cyber**, and
**space** will be **[contested]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5 Massive
[**convergence** of **capabilities** in time and space across all
domains, physical and non-physical, will be required]{.underline}.
Electromagnetic signature reduction will become the new art of
camouflage and [immediate combat decisions will be made through sheer
instinct, frontline analysis, and]{.underline} most importantly, a
[clear understanding of mission objectives]{.underline}. "Commanders
intent" will rule the day.

Hooked on Technology

After nearly two decades of counterinsurgency (COIN) centric conflict in
the Middle East, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[has]{.underline} an entire generation of officers, many now senior, who
have [grown]{.underline} quite [**dependent** on
**[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. An operational environment of
airspace dominance, [**instantaneous access** to **information**,
uninterrupted **communications**, and the unblinking eye of unmanned
platforms providing realtime **battlefield imagery**]{.underline} has
[create]{.underline}d a generation of leaders with [an **insatiable
appetite** for **information**]{.underline}.7

Worse, [this environment has **[eroded]{.mark}** our [**decentralized**
**d**]{.mark}e**[c]{.mark}**ision **[m]{.mark}**aking. Decisions are now
made **[levels above]{.mark}** where they should be because of the
**technological [ease]{.mark}** [of **involvement**]{.mark} and a
**desire** for **absolute precision**.]{.underline} When senior officers
step down from the strategic or operational levels of warfare into the
tactical, they [[create **resentment**]{.mark}, a **[lack of
trust]{.mark}**, **[uncertainty]{.mark}** amongst subordinate leaders,
and an environment of **[dependency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.8

The problem of technologically driven command and control (C2) and
decision making has been further exacerbated through the application of
COIN principles during the last two decades of operations. COIN involves
significant measures to embrace the local population with strict
avoidance of collateral damage. Avoidance of unnecessary civilian
casualties and protection of noncombatants are principles of warfare
enshrined in International Humanitarian Law and the Geneva Conventions;
however, COIN application took these principles to levels unforeseen
before in warfare resulting in constriction of authorities, reduced
subordinate initiative, and direct involvement and oversight by senior
commanders in tactical operations with suboptimal results.

This has resulted in an [**overly centralized** command
**philosophy**]{.underline} where [decisions are made after massive
**data analysis** to examine all exigencies]{.underline}, thus
[**[stifling]{.mark}** subordinate **[initiative]{.mark}** and
**[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 Under the auspices of these
unrealistic expectations, [the targeting authority for lethal actions
has been **removed** [from the **operator**]{.mark} and restricted [to
**upper echelon**]{.mark} decision makers]{.underline}. Decisions that
should be made by captains are now being made by colonels. Precious time
is lost when the targeting decision cycle requires approval from a
hierarchal chain of command.10 [The [future **VUCA**]{.mark}
**environment** will not permit this manner of operations. **Approval
[authority]{.mark}** for kinetic and non-kinetic fires will [need to be
maintained]{.mark} at **battalion**, **company**, and at times **squad
level**.]{.underline}

Auftragstaktik: A Philosophy of the Art of War and Leadership

At the turn of the 19th century, the Germany Army developed
Auftragstaktik, a new philosophy for waging war. Designed to enhance
speed of action, Auftragstaktik was refined during the internal
struggles of trench warfare in World War I, resulting in the operational
concepts of the elastic defense in 1916 and the assault tactics of 1918.
Following the war, these concepts were further developed in the German
Army Field Manual of 1933, which promoted the aggressive Blitzkrieg
tactics of World War II.12

Auftragstaktik was not simply the issuance of mission command orders, a
C2 system, or laissez-faire free for all. It was a way of thinking,
encompassing an understanding of warfare, leadership traits to be
exemplified, C2 mission command orders, and an emphasis on
relationships. This new way of thinking was institutionalized through
the training and education of the entire force, introduced during basic
training, and continued throughout their careers. Leaders at all levels
embraced these groundbreaking concepts and developed a professional
kinship based on trust and knowledge of each other's abilities.13

Auftragstaktik was a broad-based institutionalized philosophy
encompassing the art of warfare, the strength of which was anchored in
relationships. Relationships based upon mutual trust, keen insight into
each other's abilities, and respect amongst warriors. It was an
environment where commanders at all levels developed the "what" of
commander's intent with the expectation that subordinates would exercise
the full scope of their initiative, experience, intellect, and ingenuity
to derive the "how" of mission accomplishment.14

Subordinate driven action and decision making was not just expected; it
was an institutional vow. Mistakes were expected and corrected as part
of professional development, while inaction or indecisiveness was not
tolerated.15 Critical thinking and a joy of responsibility were
derivatives of self-generated discipline, and the Germans understood the
importance of operating one up and thinking two down.16 Auftragstaktik
created a culture of decentralized decision making with a universal
understanding that no operational plan survived contact with the enemy
and a belief that every action in combat is unique, requiring
initiative, rapid assessment, and aggressive action.17

Developing a Culture of Decentralized Decision Making

Since World War II, several American military organizations have
attempted to replicate the theory of Auftragstaktik. The Army has made
strides with its development of Mission Command and the Adaptive
Leadership Training and Education model focused on problem solving
skills and critical thinking; however, neither have been
institutionalized across the force.19 The DOD pioneered the "Joint All
Domain Command and Control System" to enhance decision making at lower
levels, but this concept is still embryonic.20 The Marine Corps, renown
for adaptability and emphasis on their NCO leadership, has released MCDP
7, Learning, outlining a visionary philosophy where the mind is the
weapon surpassing all forms of technology.21 Despite these measures,
[the **overall focus** across the **joint force** remains on
**centralized** decision making]{.underline}.

The true spirit of Auftragstaktik, understanding "[intent]{.underline},"
[the inherent relationship between leaders, and the delicate
**[balance]{.mark}** between **authority** and **responsibility**, has
been **overlooked** and has [**not** been
**institutionalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} in U.S. military training
centers and universities. [A complete paradigm shift]{.underline} in
thinking [is required]{.underline} in our teaching methodologies from
"what to think" to "how to think." A cognitive leap must be made from
competency-based learning to outcome-based learning. Our training
institutions must shift from report card box-checking to discovery
learning and development. This change must cover the entire educational
spectrum from our entry-level training to our seniorlevel professional
development and must be institutionalized in our training centers for
deployment and combat readiness.22 Additionally, this must include joint
multi-domain exercises in a C2 denied environment, challenging and
stress checking our processes, equipment, and people.23

Emotional intelligence must be a key attribute of leadership allowing
for subordinate level involvement in decisions and outcomes. We need to
instill the importance of developing deep and enriching professional
relationships throughout the force, relationships developed through
shared hardships, rigorous real-world training, and in places like the
officer and staff-NCO clubs, where tactics and life lessons are shared
from teacher to scholar.

The King of Domains: The Human Domain

Message to the Joint Force 2015

Critics argue that decentralized decision making and mission command are
dying concepts. An argument is made that **[tech]{.underline}**nological
[**advancements** in **[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence,
**quantum computing**, and **big data** analysis [will **overcome**
the]{.mark} need for critical thinking and **[human]{.mark}**
**d**e**c**ision **m**aking on the **battlefield**]{.underline}. Leaders
will be replaced by machines, and fighting will be done largely by
unmanned platforms.25 [History will prove them
**[wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. History is already replete with The
[inventions]{.underline} of today and tomorrow will [create a new
paradigm in warfare, one in which the Sailor, Soldier, Marine, or
aviator---**enabled** by **tech**nology---will [still]{.mark} be
[**required** to **make decisions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 We currently
have [the domains of sea, air, land, cyber, and space; however, the
**human domain** reins above all. Future warfare will be **faster**,
**more lethal**, and **more dispersed** than ever witnessed before.
Leaders at all levels will operate [off **instinct** and]{.mark}
**commander's [intent]{.mark}** in an environment of **degraded
communications**, **cloaked identification**, **strained supply lines**,
and extremely **dispersed formations**.]{.underline} The [emergence of
new weapons with significant range and lethality will require forward
**unit control**.]{.underline} In this environment,
[**[decentralize]{.mark}d** decision making will become even more
**[paramount]{.mark}** and small unit leaders at the company and squad
level will [require]{.mark} **operational [authorities]{.mark}**
historically maintained at the **brigade level** and
**higher**.]{.underline}

Undoubtedly, [[to assist leaders]{.mark}, **emerging
[tech]{.mark}**nologies to **[enhance decision- making]{.mark}**
processes should be explored and utilized]{.underline}. Technologies,
such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Deep Green, a
system to enter into the adversarial decision-making process or the
Real-Time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision Making, which uses
predictive analysis and simulations to analyze enemy actions, should be
further analyzed.28 Another emerging technology to enhance decision
making is Think, Analyze, and Connect, a massive search engine for
analysis being implemented by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency for
collaboration and decision making.29 The Joint Assistance for Deployment
Execution, designed for planning and course of action comparison, is yet
another within this family of systems.30

With the emergence of the Global Information Grid, everyone now has
access to the same data. Senior leaders, non-natives to the digital era,
are at a distinct disadvantage. [Anyone harboring information at higher
echelons will quickly become irrelevant and part of the
problem]{.underline}.31 [Knowledge is only powerful if it is shared and
sharing information must be viewed as a way to enhance decision making
amongst subordinates.]{.underline} The German model of Auftragstaktik
placed emphasis on the tactical commander for flexibility in making
decisions to affect the overall intent.32 [Technology should
**[not]{.mark}** be used as a means [to **micromanage**]{.mark} but to
**enhance** our **subordinates' ability** to **observe**, **orient**,
**decide**, and **act faster** than our enemy.]{.underline}33

Now, [in an era of advanced [tech]{.mark}nologies with the [potential to
create **over supervision**]{.mark}]{.underline}, more [emphasis must be
placed upon the **issuance** of **clear** and **concise** **commander's
intent**, the **sinew** between the **mission** and the concept of
**operations**]{.underline}.34 [**[Decentralize]{.mark}d** decision
making is the [only way to **harness**]{.mark} the **collective energy**
of the **[joint force]{.mark}** enhancing **lethality** and
**survivability** on the modern battlefield.]{.underline} The concept of
the "Strategic Corporal" is still valid and needs to be rekindled.35 At
the same time, [we must focus]{.underline} the development of our senior
leaders [on]{.underline} the [strategic application of all instruments
of national power, critical thinking, and the art of enabling
decentralized decision making by their subordinates]{.underline}.36

Enabling the Paradigm Shift

Much has been written about [the future of warfare]{.underline}. We know
it [will be trans-regional, multi-domain, and multi-functional. New
technologies will emerge altering]{.underline} the very character of
[warfare [and victory]{.mark} will go to those who **harness** the
**chaos** [of]{.mark} the **VUCA [environment]{.mark}** using **speed**
and **tempo** to **enhance** their **lethality**]{.underline}. The
future battlefield will [require **decentralized decision making** with
**operational authority** pushed to the **lowest level** possible. In
this complex and volatile environment, [NATO can **establish**]{.mark}
and **maintain** **[strategic]{.mark}** and [**operational primacy**
over]{.mark} our **[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} through
investment in our human capital. To achieve this, NATO must
revolutionize the way we think from "what to think" to "how to think."

This [radical [change must be **institutionalized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
across the force from the onset of training through career progression.
Training must be challenging, setting conditions for a real-world
experience where all domains are contested. It must stress test our
people, equipment, and processes [to ensure **operational readiness**
and **resilience**]{.underline}.

What the Alliance needs is a new culture of Auftragstaktik where
commanders develop true relationships with their subordinates, a culture
where the commander's intent is the watch word of operations, and where
the "how" of mission accomplishment is left to subordinates. We must
foster an environ- ment where our subordinates know to take action in
the absence of orders. We must train to an expectation of initiative and
encourage them to employ their ingenuity, experience, and knowledge of
the environment to ensure that the commander's vision becomes a reality.

### multidomain operations

#### Effective [cross-domain strategies]{.underline} is key to [deterrence]{.underline} of grey-zone strategies in [land]{.underline}, [air]{.underline}, [sea]{.underline}, [cyber]{.underline}, and [space]{.underline}

Deterrence. In: Osinga, F., Sweijs, T. (eds) NL ARMS Netherlands Annual

[**[Deterrence]{.mark}** is about [convincing **adversaries** to
**refrain** from]{.mark} certain behaviour through the prospect of
**costs** that **outweigh** the **benefits**.]{.underline}1 As related
in the preface to this volume by Osinga and Sweijs, deterrence has been
a [central tenet of strategic practice]{.underline} throughout history,2
even if its logic was only clearly articulated in the aftermath of the
Second World War. Deterrence scholarship has since then evolved in four
consecutive waves. The first, second and third wave of the deterrence
literature, which emerged during the Cold War, tended to almost
exclusively focus on deterrence of high-intensity aggression including
most importantly the possible use of nuclear weapons alongside large
scale conventional invasion.3 [Lower-intensity threats]{.underline}
which were considered mere nuisances were largely left outside of the
scope of investigation.4 However, these [became]{.underline} more
[important]{.underline} in the 1990s [with the]{.underline} demise of
the Soviet Union and the [emergence of non-traditional
threats]{.underline} such as terrorism.5 This gave birth to the fourth
wave of deterrence literature that focused on the question whether
deterrence would work against such threats that emerged in the 1990s and
2000s.6 Over the past decade, [a new body of ideas has been emerging
concerning the application of deterrence in today's strategic
environment. An important characteristic of our age is the
**proliferation** of ways and means by which **[hostile
activities]{.mark}** can be **perpetrated**]{.underline}. Accordingly,
[strategists have started to pay more attention to the application of
deterrence [in **new domains**]{.mark} and to **cross domain
deterrence**]{.underline} (**[CDD]{.underline}**), [across both
**traditional** and **new** domains]{.underline}. This chapter appraises
the contribution of the emerging body of cross domain deterrence
literature to deterrence theory and deterrence practice. It explains the
context in which theories of cross domain deterrence have emerged and
elaborates different conceptualisations of cross domain deterrence
distinguishing between two different approaches. The conclusion
summarises the findings and elaborates their implications for theory and
practice.7

8.2 The Origins of Cross-Domain Deterrence

The shift in attention to [CDD can be explained by two principal
challenges]{.underline}. The first challenge relates to the progressive
[**[integration]{.mark}** and **synchronization** [of]{.mark} military
[operations across]{.mark} different domains]{.underline}
(**[[land]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[air]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [and the **inherent disharmony**
between different levels of war]{.underline}
(**[strategic]{.underline}**, **[operational]{.underline}** and
**[tactical]{.underline}**).8 This is because [military [organizations
aspire to]{.mark} better **[integrate]{.mark}** physical, social and
communication **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [in]{.mark} their ability to
**apply violence** in the pursuit of **political objectives**, leading
to strategic **compression** and **[cross domain warfare]{.mark}**.
Multi-domain operations concepts are being developed to guide efforts to
**synchronise actions** both **horizontally** across domains and
**vertically** across levels of war.]{.underline}9 In light of the
cross-domain nature of the challenge, strategists are envisaging
analogous responses, including CDD.

The second challenge relates to the [increased [salience of
"**hybrid**]{.mark}" or "**grey zone**" [strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [feature the simultaneous employment of military and non-military
instruments]{.underline}, typically [below the **conventional** military
**threshold**, in an **ambiguous fashion** in order to **evade
attribution**]{.underline}, with the goal [to exploit adversary's
**vulnerabilities**, in the pursuit of political
objectives]{.underline}.10 While the analytical value of the labels as
such have caused considerable debate,11 the real-world impact of [these
strategies [poses]{.mark} a serious **strategic
[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their increased [salience stems from
the enormous **costs** associated with **interstate wars**, which makes
major military powers disinclined from waging actual hot wars against
each other]{.underline}. These [[powers]{.mark} therefore [try
and]{.mark} find alternative ways to **[achieve]{.mark}** their
**political [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}---in line with the
original tenets of the coercive diplomacy literature. Furthermore, the
increased salience of [grey zone strategies]{.underline} also [derives
from]{.underline} the [**opportunities** offered by new avenues [to
**hurt opponents** due to]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}nological** and
**societal** [developments]{.mark}]{.underline} because of the global
wiring of societies over the past quarter century. [Strategically
innovative actors have been making **frequent use** of these avenues
over the past decade to **considerable effect**]{.underline}. These
developments have led scholars and strategists to start thinking about
the use and [[utility of]{.mark} **cross domain [deterrence]{.mark}** in
dealing with **adversaries** [employ]{.mark}ing **cross domain
[strategies]{.mark}** also **outside** the **traditional military
domains**]{.underline}.

Authors from both sides of the Atlantic generally concur that
[[cross-domain]{.mark} deterrence [involves]{.mark} the use of
[threats]{.mark} in one domain to deter activities in (an)other
domain(s).]{.underline} Some authors define cross domain deterrence
exclusively [in]{.underline} the military domains [**land**, **sea**,
**air**, **cyber** and **space**]{.underline} albeit at different levels
of abstraction. James Scouras, Edward Smyth and Thomas Mahnken assert
for example that it is the [prospect of **[retaliation]{.mark}** from
one domain to another which [constitutes]{.mark} the essence of
[CDD]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 It is worth noting that the authors seem to
focus exclusively on deterrence by punishment rather than denial. James
Dawkins emphasizes that [CDD involves the use of **specific weapons**
rather than mere **threats** or **retaliation** in general.]{.underline}
His conceptualization includes both punishment and denial strategies and
draws attention to the actual instruments by which deterrent effects are
to be achieved.13 Despite the differences in abstraction, these authors
understand CDD to operate specifically within the military domains.

Since its formation in 1995 as a result of the merger of the Cold
War-era 1 German Corps and 1 Dutch Corps, 1 German-Netherlands (GE/NL)
Corps has repeatedly confirmed the commitment of its framework nations
(Germany and Netherlands) to NATO, deploying to Afghanistan in 2003,
2009, and 2013. [[To]{.mark} continue this commitment, **[deter
aggression]{.mark}**, and **defend** the **Euro-Atlantic**
area]{.underline}, 1 (GE/NL) [[Corps must]{.mark} **demonstrate** the
**ability** to [conduct]{.mark} **large-scale combat**
[operations]{.mark} as part of **NATO** against a peer **enemy** in an
**Article 5** scenario. The ability to conduct **large-scale combat
operations** underpins the **credibility** of the **Alliance's
deterrence** and provides the basis for the **defense** of the
**Euro-Atlantic** area in the event of conflict.]{.underline} This means
that 1 (GE/NL) [Corps must possess the ability to **successfully
perform** the **warfighting corps** role]{.underline}, following its
2023 stand-by period as the NATO Response Force (NRF) Land Component
Command (LCC).1

[**Execution** of the **warfighting corps** role [on]{.mark} the
**Euro-Atlantic** [**multi-domain** battlefields]{.mark}]{.underline} of
today and tomorrow [requires specific **capabilities**, in the required
**capacities**, along with the **expertise** necessary to employ them in
an **Article 5** scenario against a peer enemy. As part of its
transformation into a **warfighting corps** capable of multi-domain
operations (**MDO**]{.underline}), 1 (GE/NL) Corps has conducted a
campaign of learning consisting of academics, [**wargaming**, and
**training** and **exercises**]{.underline}. The results of this work
are detailed below and specify the roles and responsibilities of a NATO
warfighting corps within MDO, define the requirements and the structure
for an MDO-capable warfighting corps, and describe the conduct of corps
operations within the context of an Article 5 scenario.2

Organization

[[In contrast to]{.underline}]{.mark} stabilization operations in which
the corps acted as a [**[command-and-control]{.mark}** node, for
warfighting]{.underline} operations the [corps functions]{.underline}
not only [as]{.underline} a [headquarters but also]{.underline} as a
[formation that consists of]{.underline} its headquarters, [combat and
maneuver support forces, sustainment units, and other functional support
units assigned to, attached to, or under the operational control of the
corps]{.underline}.3 Also included are functional support capabilities
operating in direct support of the corps or its subordinate divisions.
Functional support units operating in the corps area of operations as
general support, but not part of the corps, are normally not included in
the corps formation.

When operating in the context of an Article 5 or warfighting operation,
[the corps]{.underline} is the highest tactical echelon. It [is task
organized for the operation, taking into account the operational and
mission variables, and that task organization is dependent on the
relative combat power of the enemy formations with which the corps will
be engaged, the mission it receives, and the size of the area of
operations in which it will operate.]{.underline} There are several
proposed corps structures for the MDO battlefields of today and
tomorrow. While there is much overlap to these proposals, the 1 (GE/NL)
Corps structure was specifically developed to focus on the threats to
the Euro-Atlantic area (see figure 1).4

Ideally, a NATO corps capable of conducting multi-domain operations
within the Euro-Atlantic area includes the following:

2 to 5 divisions

1 x military **[intelligence]{.underline}** brigade

1 x intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(**[ISR]{.underline}**) battalion equipped with unmanned aircraft
systems (UAS) and unattended ground sensors (UGS)

1 x **[electronic warfare]{.underline}** battalion

Much of the structure above may sound familiar. However, based upon
analysis conducted by 1 (GE/NL) Corps, this structure is better
optimized to penetrate and dis-integrate the integrated air defense
systems (IADS) and the integrated fires complex (IFC) that could
challenge NATO forces in the Euro-Atlantic area. The presence of
substantial long-range fires systems provides the corps with an organic
capability to engage enemy fires systems and support assigned forces or
other component commanders if conflict should occur. The corps's
capability to link a greater number of sensors than in the past, located
throughout the depth of an expanded battlefield, to specific shooters
enables it to converge capabilities in support of operational objectives
and enhances the deterrent effect of Alliance ground forces.6

A key formation within the corps is the corps fires command, which
integrates joint, interorganizational, and multinational targeting
capabilities. The corps fires command plans, coordinates, and delivers
joint all-domain fires to shape operations. The scale and scope of
operations against a peer enemy generally necessitates multiple brigades
of long-range rockets and missile systems. Two assigned field artillery
brigades provide the corps with the means to defeat an enemy's
long-range and midrange fires and IADS to enable divisional tactical
operations and freedom of maneuver for the Alliance joint force.7

[Unlike a U.S. Army corps, a NATO [corps does not]{.mark} fall under a
standing theater army with organic capabilities or [have]{.mark}
**subordinate divisions** with a **common** and [**standardized**
**divisional structure**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Depending on the
composition of the corps's higher echelon and subordinate divisions and
brigades, the [corps may require additional capabilities or
capacity.]{.underline} These [**capability gaps** are most likely to be
found in electronic warfare (**EW**), **fires**, **ISR**, and
**intelligence**. During Article 5 operations, **[divisions]{.mark}**
will require **additional assets** to [assist in **converging**]{.mark}
**effects** from **multiple [domains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the
corps does not own space or special operations assets and its organic
cyberspace capabilities are limited, it does possess the necessary
tie-ins and expertise to integrate these domains into its operations.
[As the critical echelon in the execution of **MDO**, the corps will
need the **capacity** to [provide **concurrent support**]{.mark} to
**multiple divisions**]{.underline}.8

Role of the Corps

1 (GE/NL) Corps is a multinational headquarters assigned to NATO.
Therefore, NATO-compatible equipment (e.g., communication and
information systems), and NATO processes and procedures (e.g., the
operations planning process; data management platforms; and Allied
Procedural Publication 28, Tactical Planning for Land Forces) will be
used. It can translate operational inputs into tactical outputs. It
synchronizes maneuver, fires, and effects with the requisite maneuver
support and sustainment to shape the environment for subordinate forces
to accomplish tactical missions and achieve operational and strategic
objectives. This is accomplished through planning and mission orders to
subordinate forces, making the best use of their capabilities and
capacities while enforcing unity of command and achieving unity of
effort.

To defeat the enemy, the corps executes five functions. It shapes the
enemy forces in the corps deep area with available corps and joint
capabilities;

maneuvers divisions and other combat formations to gain positions of
advantage to close with and defeat enemy forces and compel their
surrender or withdrawal, synchronizing the maneuver of divisions and, if
necessary, brigades to reduce friction and coordinating the simultaneous
maneuver of multiple formations in time and space;

initiates, executes, implements, ensures, and supports consolidation
activities to set conditions for transition to a sustainable political
end state;

sustains close, deep, and consolidation operations; and

generates combat power through RSOM&I and reconstitution.

The corps sets the conditions for subordinate divisions to focus on the
close fight by integrating all elements of combat power in time and
space to disrupt, interdict, and degrade the enemy while shaping the
operating environment and enabling friendly forces to ensure freedom of
action at the expense of its opponent. While the corps leverages
Alliance joint capabilities to achieve effects in its area of
operations, it is fundamentally a tactical and land-centric formation.9

In the conduct of its operations, [it is [essential that]{.mark} the
[**corps** sets]{.mark} an **operational [tempo]{.mark}** that does not
**permit** the **enemy** to **recover** and establishes an **inexorable
momentum** using **echeloned maneuver** to ensure that once **contact**
is **gained**, it is **maintained**.]{.underline} The corps feeds forces
into the main battle area and controls the dispersion and mass of
maneuver units. Divisions do the same at their level. [The corps enables
**operational tempo** at the division level [by keeping enemy]{.mark}
**[space]{.mark}**, **[cyber]{.mark}**, **[air]{.mark} defense**, and
**long-range** and **midrange fires** [under]{.mark} **constant
[pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This allows the divisions to finish
decisively once they gain contact with the enemy. [**Momentum** and
**tempo** are **vital** and are metrics the corps commander uses to
gauge success.]{.underline}10

Momentum and tempo are the threads that run through the corps's
operations [and ensure that the enemy faces a **continuous onslaught**
of simultaneous **multi-echelon convergence**.]{.underline} The
importance of controlling the pace of operations challenges command and
control because the corps must maintain forces not in contact to ensure
fresh forces can reinforce success. The side that sets an overwhelming
tempo will win. However, [the [speed]{.mark} component of tempo is not
just speed of decision but also the **cumulative speed** of [all]{.mark}
our actions from **[planning]{.mark}** and **issuing orders** to
**[executing]{.mark} movements**, **fire missions**, [and
**transmitting**]{.mark} **decisions**.]{.underline}11

[Given the nature of the **threats** posed to the **Euro-Atlantic**
area, [an **MDO-capable NATO corps** must]{.mark} maintain **joint**,
**interservice**, and **multinational relationships** to
[facilitate]{.mark} the **[quick transition]{.mark}** to
**conflict**]{.underline}. These relationships help prepare the corps
for its role as the senior land tactical headquarters and are developed
and maintained through multi- and bilateral training events and
exchanges as well as the multinational layout of the headquarters
itself. 1 (GE/NL) Corps emphasizes and trains the comprehensive approach
in all phases of competition, conflict, and postconflict.12

[The [presence of]{.mark} a corps and its subordinate units serves as a
**[deterrent force]{.mark}** capable of simultaneously **engaging**
multiple **enemy** combined arms **armies** and provides the means to
**[shape]{.mark}** the area of **[responsibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
During competition, [the conduct of **intelligence activities** to set
the **conditions** for successful combat operations will be a **major
focus** of the corps. This work is essential to establishing the
preconditions not only for a rapid transition to conflict but also for
the **achievement** of **tactical objectives**]{.underline}. [This
includes the conduct of the **threat systems analysis** and
[**comprehensive understanding** of]{.mark} the **[operational
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} (CUOE) necessary to [[support]{.mark}
the **[convergence]{.mark}** of **Alliance**, **national**, and
**organic assets** necessary to achieve the **desired effects** against
the enemy's sophisticated and resilient layered standoff.]{.underline}13

The corps [denies/deters the ability of an enemy's ISR and EW systems to
target NATO formations and facilities to gather information about
capabilities.]{.underline} In addition, as deception is a key function
of the corps, it will focus on deceiving and denying an adversary's
access to information related to current and future operating locations,
units, and equipment.

To achieve decisive effects on an enemy during combat operations, [the
[corps **synchronize**]{.mark}**s** and **integrates** **[combat
power]{.mark}** throughout the **expanded battlefield**. The ability of
the corps to [shape]{.mark} the **lower [operational]{.mark}** and
**upper [tactical]{.mark}** [environments]{.mark} is especially
**vital** to **Alliance operations**]{.underline} during the initial
period of a conflict when enemy long-range IADS will deny, or at a
minimum contest, the Alliance's use of the air domain. [The
**contribution** of the **corps** to the **penetration** and
**dis-integration** of the enemy's **layered standoff** is essential to
generating **freedom of maneuver** for the Alliance joint
force.]{.underline}14

During Article 5 or warfighting operations, the focus of the corps is on
the conduct of the fight in the deep area with the objective of
collapsing the enemy's long-range and midrange IFC and IADS. [The
MDO-capable NATO corps utilizes an array of interconnected
sensors---artillery delivered, UAS, cyberspace, space, and
infiltrated---that place enemy systems at risk. These allow the corps to
employ its long-range artillery to destroy targets throughout the depth
of the corps area of operations]{.underline}. It is important to
remember that this is not a targeting drill; these mid- and long-range
enemy systems are attacked to enable maneuver and freedom of action.
[Only by defeating the enemy's layered standoff will the Alliance be
able to apply its air assets and will the corps's subordinate divisions
get to the close fight with the combat power to prevail.]{.underline}15

[The corps is the [**central echelon** in]{.mark} the [**planning** and
**execution**]{.mark} of MDO [and]{.mark} is the **[lowest
echelon]{.mark}** [capable of **converging**]{.mark} all
**[domains]{.mark}**. It **[creates]{.mark}** the [**conditions** for
**convergence** at **lower echelons** by]{.mark} **[allocating
resources]{.mark}**, sequencing **division maneuver**, and
**incorporating** it with deception]{.underline}. Especially within
NATO, [the corps will be the primary **integrator** and **synchronizer**
of **multi-domain capability** in the **forward conflict** area and will
array assigned capabilities to defeat **enemy systems** and enable
**tactical maneuver**.]{.underline}

Much as it does with the [**air** and **maritime** domains, the corps
coordinates for]{.underline}---it does not execute---[and integrates
effects from the **space** and **cyberspace**]{.underline} domains
through space and cyber support teams embedded in the command. These
include effects to disrupt satellite communications to compound [effects
by organic EW against key command-and-control nodes to degrade enemy
positioning, navigation, and timing,]{.underline} [**cyberspace** and
space-based **ISR**, and **o**ffensive **c**yberspace
**o**peration**s**]{.underline}. Though the corps may not have the
organic capabilities in all domains, it must possess the ability---to
include the necessary staff bandwidth and expertise---to access effects
from the space, cyberspace, and other domains.

By [[synchronising]{.mark} all reconnaissance and security operations
across **[subordinate units]{.mark}**, **coordinating intel**ligence
requirements, and **fusing intel**ligence from multiple echelons, the
corps supports echeloned maneuver and actively [**informs** and
**integrates**]{.mark} the full range of **[capabilities]{.mark}** in
all domains throughout the depth of the battlefield.]{.underline}
Additionally, the corps unburdens subordinate formations by narrowing
their focus, reducing their span of control, and maintaining the broader
perspective in time and space, across the expanded battlefield. The
planning horizon of a corps is typically seventy-two to ninety-six plus
hours.16

While the corps's focus is on the deep area, and much has evolved with
MDO, the corps still supports division-level tactical maneuver. In the
close fight, it will support its major subordinate units by reinforcing
them with forces, especially in the main effort (Schwerpunkt) and by
applying joint effects, fire support, air and missile defense, and to a
limited extent, cyber defense. The corps will have to conduct
information activities and additional stability tasks as well. [The
ability of the corps to provide this **support** to its **subordinate
divisions** is especially [**critical** in]{.mark} a **[multinational
setting]{.mark}** where the structure and capabilities of its
subordinate divisions can greatly vary]{.underline}.17

To preserve the corps's freedom of action for operations in the deep and
close areas and to extend the force's operational reach, in part through
the generation or reconstitution of combat power, the corps must provide
security in the rear area to prevent or minimize disruption of combat
support and combat service support from the rear area forward and
provide unimpeded movement of friendly forces throughout the rear area.
To do this, the corps must be able to find, fix, and defeat enemy
incursions into the rear area. This will require close coordination with
host-nation defense and security forces, and nonmilitary actors.18

The corps must wage this fight to protect its formations in the rear and
close areas while simultaneously waging a fight in the deep area to set
conditions for exploitation, and it must manage forces out of contact to
ensure exploitation can be sustained and reinforced. The corps must
provide for the echelonment of formations to ensure depth and agility to
maintain tempo once a penetration occurs.19

**\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]**

The corps protects its subordinate tactical formations from attacks
originating in other domains. Especially important is the requirement to
provide air and missile defense against the enemy's substantial
inventory of artillery and ground- and air-launched missiles. This will
enable the divisions to engage in the close fight with favorable combat
power ratios. To do this, the corps must not only possess the necessary
air and missile defense assets but also incorporate deception and
electromagnetic spectrum management into its operations. The main effort
will be on proactive counterfire.20

To succeed, the corps must set the conditions prior to conflict (i.e.,
in competition). Especially important is the continuous conduct and
refinement of the robust CUOE of the enemy required to understand its
key systems so the corps can begin the penetration and dis-integration
of the enemy's mid- and long-range IADS and IFC during the transition to
conflict. Vital to the success of these efforts is the corps's ability
to exercise command and control throughout the depth of the expanded
battlefield. To command and control throughout the entirety of its area
of operations, the corps will employ a distributive command post
structure using multiple, dispersed, and mobile command posts.21

The corps area of operations and responsibility can extend up to 500 km
deep and includes multiple echelons of tactical- and operational-level
adversarial capabilities. Figure 2 illustrates how a corps operates
across more than 60,000 km2 during large-scale combat operations.
Assuming the corps consists of two divisions abreast, the area of
operations for the corps could be 500 km x 120 km. In consequence, the
corps area of influence would extend out 500 km/72 hrs., while the corps
area of interest would extend out to 1,000 km/96 hrs.22 In this example,
the corps rear area extends 200 to 250 km to the rear of the forward
line of own troops.23

Because [AI is a **general-purpose** technology]{.underline}, the
corresponding adoption challenges may prove especially difficult. There
is a great deal of emphasis at present on how the United States can more
effectively recruit and retain AI talent to work for the national
security community and the government as a whole. This is critical, but
[the **[people making decisions]{.mark}** about the **use of
algorithms** from the **situation room** to the **battlefield** will
[not]{.mark} necessarily be **[informed]{.mark}** about current
**developments** in **AI**, let alone be **AI experts**, but **military
leaders** and **policymakers**.]{.underline} Thus, [a **vital
challenge** is familiarizing and educating government leaders and
policymakers about AI.]{.underline} This is a different challenge than
that of incentivizing those with AI expertise to work for the U.S.
government. Instead, it is about AI education for the policy community.

AI education for the policy community, from military leaders to Hill
staffers to senior government officials, needs to happen now, as cases
outside of the national security sphere illustrate. For example, in
December 2017, the New York City council unanimously passed a bill that
required the Office of the Mayor to form a task force dedicated to
increasing transparency and oversight of the algorithms used by the
city. A local city council member characterized the bill as essential,
saying of the algorithms, "I don't know what it is. I don't know how it
works. I don't know what factors go into it. As we advance into the 21st
century, [we must ensure our government is not '**black
boxed**.']{.underline}"

This example touches on a key dynamic: [Top
**policymakers**]{.underline} --- who [are generally **[not]{.mark}
technically [trained]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [are at an increasing
[risk of being "**black boxed**" as]{.mark} technological **[complexity
increases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [especially true given
**questions** even at the **vanguard** of AI research about the
"**explainability**" of **algorithms**.]{.underline} However,
[**organizational [decisions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} **AI
[adoption]{.mark}** and **applications** that "generally
**[shape]{.mark}** the [**impact** of]{.mark} that
**[tech]{.mark}**nology" are being made today]{.underline}. Section 256
of the FY20 NDAA provides a first step towards national security
literacy in AI, requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop an AI
education strategy for military servicemembers. But [there are questions
about implementation, given well-known issues with professional military
education, and the **[national security community]{.mark}** more broadly
[requires]{.mark} **AI [literacy]{.mark}**, not just military service
members, since most [**policymakers** are not in
**uniform**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**[effective use]{.mark}** of algorithms in the national security
sphere [requires]{.mark} **basic [education]{.mark}** as well as
[**recognition** of]{.mark} what algorithms can and can't do, the risks
of **automation [bias]{.mark}** and **cognitive [offloading]{.mark}** to
machines, the **dangers** of **[accidents]{.mark}** and **[data
poisoning]{.mark}**, among other challenges. These need to be
**demystified** and made **relevant** to national security officials,
especially those **[senior leaders]{.mark}** who may [not]{.mark}
consider themselves **tech-[savvy]{.mark}**. It is [**impossible** to
hedge against]{.mark} **potential [dangers]{.mark}** of a given
**tech**nology if those using it do not fully **understand** and
therefore many not be able to **control** it. [Failure]{.mark} to
control for **biases**, **weaknesses**, and **accidents** of even the
most innocuous-seeming of algorithms has the potential to
**[disrupt]{.mark}** and create **unintended policy outcomes** that
**undermine US [leadership]{.mark}** [in AI and]{.mark} US **[national
security]{.mark}** in general.]{.underline} Fortunately, there are a
number of paths forward for effective AI education for end users, from
online coursework to programs in civilian universities, to specially
designed national security training programs.

#### [AI policies]{.underline} made at [high-levels]{.underline} causes [erroneous deployment]{.underline} of technology -- [algorithmic influence]{.underline} on [decision-making processes]{.underline} require [clear understanding]{.underline} that senior policymakers [don't have]{.underline}

Why and What?

In the years ahead, [**high level** government **[leaders]{.mark}**,
despite having]{.underline} relatively **[[rudimentary
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** of it, [will [make]{.mark} an array
of **formative [decisions]{.mark}** regarding **AI**, including
**funding**, operations, **assessing** adversary developments,
**ethical** and **moral** factors **[influencing
adoption]{.mark}**]{.underline}, managing associated employment issues,
and so on. [Adopting AI, from an organizational
perspective]{.underline}, may therefore have several similarities to how
entire organizations shifted in response to electricity, the combustion
engine, the railroad, and other dramatic advances in prior centuries.
[AI is a **wide-ranging** [tech]{.mark}nology that is already
demonstrating the **capacity** to [**shape** and **alter** the]{.mark}
innumerable ways in which we engage with the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from healthcare to soccer and
everything in between.

[Policymakers and national security officials will increasingly address
AI-driven policies and tech]{.underline}nologies, [make **fundamental
decisions** [based on]{.mark} **m**achine **l**earning **tech**niques
and [**algorithms**, and]{.mark} help [develop]{.mark} **strong
[partnerships]{.mark}** with those **creating the
tech**nology.]{.underline} How do we ensure that decisions being made
about AI at the top levels of government are well-informed ones, when
policymakers, rather than technical experts, will make or review most of
those decisions? And, practically speaking, what do they need to know?

[[Without]{.mark} **baseline [knowledge]{.mark}**[, policymakers]{.mark}
**won't know** what questions to ask, will be **unable** to **frame**
what **issues** they are trying to solve as an "AI problem," and might
be [**overconfident** in]{.mark} their understanding of AI and therefore
[what is **feasible**]{.mark} or **practical**]{.underline}. This could
[**[increase]{.mark}** the chance of [**deployments** of]{.mark}
[algorithms tha]{.mark}t lead [to]{.mark} more **errors** and
**[accidents]{.mark}** than necessary. National security leaders need to
be **up-to-date** on important **innovations** and **factors** that
change **global dynamics** --- such as **AI**]{.underline} has the
potential to do. Being early adopters when it comes to functional
knowledge for using algorithms is [necessary]{.underline} so that
leaders can [conduct net assessments and]{.underline} subsequently make
informed [strategic decisions]{.underline}.

Beyond AI constituting an additional substantive dimension for
consideration in planning and policy decisions, [[AI]{.mark}
will]{.underline} also effectively [[change
**decision**]{.mark}**-making [processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}
themselves. To the extent that some applications of [AI, in the context
of human-machine teams, may function as **decision aids**, those
**humans** using the **tech**nology will need to have a level of
**understanding** of how it works. To make optimal decisions about
American AI policy and strategy, policymakers will [need]{.mark} a
[**clear understanding** of]{.mark} AI [**principles** and
**techniques**]{.mark} --- enough to understand how algorithms **work**
and see potential **benefits**, but also recognize **downside risks**
and avoid getting **carried away** by the hype]{.underline}.

**[[The impact of new technologies]{.mark} and the increased tempo of
the future battlespace [may]{.mark} [overcentralize command and control
functions]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the political or strategic level.
Political and strategic [[leaders might pursue]{.mark} preemptive or

over the enemy]{.underline}, **[[not because they must but because they
can]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a result, senior leaders may be
encouraged to bypass the advisory role played by their qualified staff
and undermine the autonomy of lower level commanders. The advancement of
technological systems may end mission command, Auftragstaktik. Donald E.
Vandergriff defines Auftragstaktik as a cultural philosophy of military
professionalism:

The overall commander's intent is for the member to strive for
professionalism, in return, the individual will be given latitude in the
accomplishment of their given missions. Strenuous, but proven and
defensible standards will be used to identify those few capable of
serving in the profession of arms. Once an individual has been accepted
into the profession, a special bond forms with their comrades, which
enables team work and the solving of complex tasks. This kind of command
culture . . . must be integrated into all education and training from
the very beginning of basic training.

2 This article explores the roots of this trend, connecting historical
perspectives with implications that next-generation technology may have
on command and control.

[Technological innovation plays a critical role in the conduct of
war.]{.underline} [The adoption of new technologies in warfare has been
instrumental in replacing roles traditionally played by
humans.]{.underline} During the interwar period, between World War I and
World War II, warfare was optimized to cope with greater distances and
faster execution through increasingly complex machines. The armed forces
general staffs became more sophisticated and complex to process a
greater amount of information. The battlefield gradually moved away from
the commander, while command and control, a critical function for
warfare, moved toward automation

**[Current military capabilities are the result of a]{.underline}**n
evolutionary **[trend in which technology and information have
constantly played a central role]{.underline}**. [[With the introduction
of the]{.mark}]{.underline} network-centric
[[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (NCW) concept of operations, or the
employment of networked forces at all levels, [[commanders]{.mark}
[can]{.mark}]{.underline} now **[[access]{.mark} a [network of
sensors]{.mark}, [decision makers]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[soldiers]{.mark}, which provides shared awareness, higher tempo,
greater lethality, and survivability [on an almost global
scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**.3 The development and adoption of new
technologies has allowed political and strategic decision makers to
control the battlefield in real time even at the tactical level. **[The
impact of new technologies]{.underline}** and the increased speed in the
future battlespace **[may overcentralize command and control
functions]{.underline}** at the political or strategic level. **[[The
consequences might be detrimental]{.mark} [to the conduct of military
operations at the operational and tactical level]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In addition, [autonomous weapons and a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [are the next step toward the automation of
warfare with critical implications for command and control]{.underline}.

Decentralized Execution and Data

[AI implementation]{.underline} may [seem to imply a departure from
decentralized execution]{.underline} because of the requirements for
data and control. [**[Decentralization]{.mark} of execution** will
[remain]{.mark} an **[essential]{.mark}** tenet of
**[airpower]{.mark}**. Decentralized execution is a **requirement**
because of **uncertainty**, **friction**, **changes**, communication
**limitations**, and **ambiguity**. Decentralization [allows]{.mark}
aircrew to seize the initiative, be **responsive** to **uncertain** and
**changing environments**, and **fosters [flexibility]{.mark}** in
lower-level commanders. The most significant immediate change in
airpower execution because of **[AI]{.mark} implementation** [is]{.mark}
the [**requirement** for]{.mark} increased **[data]{.mark}
collection**.]{.underline} As previously discussed, [**data** is a
**fundamental** requirement of AI learning and performance. AI
[cannot]{.mark} accurately **[perceive]{.mark} the
[environment]{.mark}** and [make **decisions** without]{.mark}
sufficient **data collection**. Future leadership will likely highlight
**data collection** and timely **reporting requirements**]{.underline}
throughout levels of air operations [to ensure the **[feedback
loop]{.mark}** is robust. Commanders must clearly]{.underline} express
intent to operators and assist their [[decentralized execution,]{.mark}
giving them]{.underline} the proper tools [and situational awareness to
execute]{.underline} upon intent. [Operators owe [timely]{.mark} and
**[accurate]{.mark} truth [data]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} reliably

Centralization Versus Decentralized Airpower

[US doctrine prescribes]{.underline} the conduct of joint air operations
[using]{.underline} the principle of [[centralized]{.mark} control [and
decentralized]{.mark} execution.]{.underline}22 [An **oversimplified**
synopsis driving this]{.underline} tenet of airpower [is that
centralization]{.underline} of control [enables]{.underline} the senior
echelon [commanders to control, mass, and lead forces effectively;
**decentralization** of execution allows forces to seize the initiative,
respond to **uncertain** and changing environments, and fosters
**flexibility**]{.underline} in lower echelons.

[Technological developments]{.underline} frequently [**shift the
equilibrium** of this tenet of **airpower**]{.underline}. Robust
communications connectivity has increased the shared operations picture
at all levels, but it has also enabled senior leadership involvement in
the finest details of employment.23 This [**[duality]{.mark}** has
[created]{.mark} **inherent [tension]{.mark}** between the
**imperatives** of **political control** and those of **efficient
mission accomplishment**]{.underline} that leaders must understand.24
Although centralized control and execution are possible in many
situations, [a **conscious [effort]{.mark}** [to delegate]{.mark}
**execution authority**]{.underline} appropriately [will [ensure]{.mark}
the [**maintenance** of]{.mark} **US [airpower]{.mark}
agility**]{.underline}.

The balance of centralization and decentralization can shift between and
during conflicts, and [leaders must strive to **increase** what some
call "**agility**" in **airpower employment**.]{.underline} The Air
Force Future Operating Concept defines agility as [the ability to react
rapidly to situations. Agility is a **combination** of one's
**flexibility**, **speed**, **coordination**, **balance**, and
**strength**.]{.underline}25 [Decentralization generally favors
flexibility and speed]{.underline}, while centralization generally
favors coordination and strength. One's understanding of agility might
imply physical capability, but [agility also includes a cognitive
capability to react to a dynamic opponent, moving target, or shifting
environment.]{.underline}26 The [power of **[AI]{.mark}** [employment in
**airpower C2**]{.mark} lies in the **cognitive speed** and strength it
can bring **synergistically** toward the goal of agility.]{.underline}

C2 Structure

C2 systems control joint air operations, typically built around the C2
system of the service component commander, that has the preponderance of
air assets and the most exceptional ability to control them.27 The air
operations center (AOC) is the senior element of the theater air control
system, which ensures the effective planning and conduct of air, space,
and cyberspace operations. The AOC construct may also apply when
fighting with joint or coalition partners as a joint air operations
center or a coalition air operations center. The size of an AOC can vary
wildly between staff in the single digits to more than a thousand
officers, enlisted, and civilian members. Each AOC's organization
differs, but their common goal is to match available means toward tasked
military objectives. The responsibilities of the AOC typically include
planning and controlling joint air operations, recommending priorities
in air apportionment, airspace coordination, air defense coordination,
space coordination, and cyberspace coordination.

[Technological improvements]{.underline} in computing, communications,
and information sharing [have disrupted]{.underline} the [tiered C2
structure creating [disrupti]{.mark}ons from **operational
[planning]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **tactical
[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. AOC leadership is capable of making
decisions historically conducted at lower operational or tactical
echelons. Today, for example, the highest levels of operational C2 may
not delegate target identification and weapons release authority, which
was once only possible at the tactical edge. The relative overmatch
wielded when facing less capable adversaries, and the aversion to
civilian casualties and loss of life may have lulled the United States
into complacency and a false assumption that future wars will take place
in the same benign environments.28 [Increases in [**efficiency** and
**agility** needed to]{.mark} [defeat]{.mark} **near-peer
[adversaries]{.mark}** [are possible through]{.mark} **distributing
control** outside the AOC, **[decentralizing]{.mark}** the
**[execution]{.mark}** of air assets, and leveraging AI's speed and
cognitive strength across multiple levels of C2.]{.underline}

The [C2 of airpower has excellent potential to [leverage AI]{.mark}
**augmentation** and **automation**]{.underline} for increased cognitive
agility. The next section discusses one example of AI use area in
airpower C2---joint targeting. [There are [currently **data
gaps**]{.mark} [and **inefficiencies**]{.mark} within the **targeting
cycle** that [complicate]{.mark} the **efficient transfer** of
**critical information** when [**planning** and **executing**]{.mark}
joint air operations]{.underline}.29 The next sections will cover how AI
can prepare decision-makers with a better understanding of their
operating environment, filter and fuse the fire hose of battlefield data
into relevant information, and increase decision speeds.

Power Strategies

The emergence of global US interests led the United States to diversify
its approach to the use of military force. Until World War II, the
United States did not maintain large standing military forces in
peacetime. Instead, the pre-Cold War model relied on a build-up and
mobilization of forces, which then deployed to distant lands such as the
Philippines or Western Europe when crises loomed. The Berlin Crisis in
1948 and further Communist antagonism ushered in a new model of large
peacetime military forces coupled with forward basing. These bases
enabled the protection of allies that were still broken from World War
II and served as a deterrent to Soviet aggression.

The initial NATO Cold War strategy relied on large conventional forces
stationed at forward bases to deter and defend against massive Soviet
armored formations. As the costs of these large standing forces
increased, NATO adopted a deterrence strategy that relied heavily on
nuclear weapons, which ameliorated NATO's acknowledged conventional
inferiority. Over time, questions arose about the credibility of this
nuclear deterrent, and a conventional focus to NATO's force posture
returned. This conventional focus merged elements of projecting power
from the United States and Western Europe to Central Europe in an
expeditionary approach with protecting allies through forward presence
that provided a front line and a trip-wire until reserves could arrive.

The end of the Cold War resulted in drastic changes in the global US
force posture. The lack of a competitor led to the withdrawal of tens of
thousands of military personnel stationed overseas at major operating
bases. The emergence of terrorist threats enhanced this dynamic as the
US military shifted its focus to counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency
operations in Southwest Asia and the Middle East. The post-9/11 world
facilitated a force posture approach that relied on generation of
military forces in the United States; these forces rotated abroad for
deployments ranging from three to fifteen months. This model of power
projection proved stressing in its own right but was a solution to a
complex problem that largely precluded the permanent basing of US forces
in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

The [return of **great power competition** finds the US military with a
**force posture** that reflects the needs of limited **interventions**
and **counterinsurgency**. The US military has **adapted** this model to
great power competition through the **rotation** of **forces** to
**deter** and **show resolve** in both **Europe** and the
**Pacific**]{.underline}. The drawback of this approach is that it lacks
demonstrable commitment and credibility against a peer competitor,
especially in that competitor's backyard.

A Balanced Approach

[An [appropriate strategy for NATO requires]{.mark} permanent **[forward
presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO is in a new era of great power
competition within a context of general deterrence.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has not specifically threatened the Baltic
states or other Eastern European NATO member states, but its [**foreign
policy** and military **modernization** demonstrate that it is
[**reasserting itself**]{.mark} on the **world stage**. Russia's
**[anti-access]{.mark}** capabilities [complicate]{.mark} the matter,
through **[air]{.mark}** and **ground based** systems that could
**prevent NATO** from delivering additional forces into Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} For the Baltics, [general **[deterrence]{.mark}**
of Russia [requires **credible**]{.mark} **military [force]{.mark}** on
a **permanent basis**.]{.underline} Permanent forward basing of any
force is costly financially and politically, but permanently stationed
ground forces demonstrate greater commitment, and [**additional
[airpower]{.mark}** will help **[mitigate]{.mark}** Russia's
**[anti-access]{.mark}** capabilities.]{.underline}

[To revitalize the deterrent credibility of NATO vis-à-vis
Russia]{.underline}, NATO must increase its protection of member states
through forward presence rather than relying on power projection from
expeditionary or rapid response forces. [[NATO should]{.mark} take a
**balanced approach** that [combine]{.mark}s elements of the **[power
projection]{.mark}**, expeditionary model [with]{.mark} a protective,
**[forward presence]{.mark}** model]{.underline}. Only a balanced
strategy that includes forward presence will [provide an **enduring
deterrent** to Russian aggression at NATO's borders]{.underline}.

Significant increases in forward basing of military personnel and
equipment will test the political resolve of NATO and the United States.
Politicians must determine the utility of [NATO]{.underline} in terms of
both the [security]{.underline} it [[offers]{.underline}]{.mark} and its
[[potential as]{.mark} a [**binding organization** of the **liberal
order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What would happen to NATO if Russia
invades a member nation? Would NATO be able to defend or liberate that
nation utilizing its current power projection strategy? [The Baltics are
also European Union (**EU**) members, and **[fracturing]{.mark}** the
[**EU** could have]{.mark} its own **[implications]{.mark}** for the
**liberal order**]{.underline}. In comparison to the political cost of
failure, the cost of fielding an increased, permanent forward presence
is small. Only with political will, however, can NATO adjust to an era
of renewed competition.

Overview

There are two conventional strategies for deterrence, power projection
and power protection. Power projection evolved during the Cold War to
the prominent place it holds in current national military strategy.
[[**Airpower** is **critical**]{.mark} to **power projection**. Without
**air superiority**, **power projection** is
**ineffective**]{.underline}. On the other hand, forward presence is the
safest strategy to deter an aggressor from seeking a rapid military
victory, but it also requires more resources. Most importantly, the
strategies of power projection and power protection require tailoring to
the specific security context rather than rote application of the
traditional strategy.

The following analysis includes the Cold War and post-Cold War evolution
of US military force posture, and Russia's return as a great power to
include Russian anti-access capabilities. The deterrence focus is in
terms of territorial acquisition as opposed to other objects of
deterrence such as use of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, or
other actions. Examination is within the framework of general deterrence
and the strategy behind force postures, to include the evolution,
execution, and suitability of these strategies to today's current power
competition. Limitations of this short work include a focus restricted
to general deterrence rather than on other elements of coercion, and a
focus on how force postures generate deterrence, instead of other
factors such as doctrine, readiness, and weapons technology.

Chapter 1 analyzes conventional deterrence within the larger structure
of strategic coercion and focuses the scope of this thesis on general
deterrence and the prevention of a fait accompli or rapid military
victory. It includes analysis of two distinct deterrent strategies,
power projection and power protection, but also highlights the
limitations of any deterrent policy and warns of the consequences of
deterrent failure.

Chapter 2 explains the evolution of NATO's force posture during the Cold
War, tracing the rise of power projection strategies utilizing
expeditionary forces from US bases, and highlights the importance of
airpower to such a strategy. Chapter 3 analyzes the change to an almost
exclusive reliance on power projection after the Cold War as US
attention shifted from great power competition to a variety of [security
threats]{.underline}, and [underscores]{.underline} the [importance of
diplomacy, strategic warning, and **airpower**]{.underline}.

Chapter 4 describes the challenges of adapting the power projection
strategy to great power competition in an anti-access, areadenial (A2AD)
environment, and investigates the evolution of the current deterrent
strategy. This chapter recommends a NATO strategy that balances power
projection with increased protective forward presence. Finally, the
conclusion underscores key recommendations, and frames other security
challenges within an appropriate category of strategic coercion to
provide a foundation for further analysis. Russia's annexation of Crimea
and continuing actions in Ukraine demonstrate that NATO's Eastern
European countries require stronger deterrence. A quick [[Russian
**military victory** in a **Baltic st**]{.mark}**ate** would be
**difficult** to **reverse** and could [**fragment NATO** and the
**E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion]{.underline}. While power
projection has served the United States well since the end of the Cold
War, deterrence in Europe requires protective forward presence.

#### Extinction\-\--rogue tech, bio arms-racing, and climate change

**Harari '18** \[Yuval; September 26; Professor of History at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; \"We need a post-liberal order now,\"

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [common [problems]{.mark} that make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that can **[only]{.mark} be [solved
through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}**. These are **[nuclear war,
climate change and tech]{.mark}nological disruption**. You cannot build
a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation
can regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or
bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only
the European Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[[An **AI**]{.mark} **arms race** [or]{.mark} a
**[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[**[guarantees]{.mark} the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[the loser will likely be [humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations [will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **greater trust between countries**. This is **not an
impossible mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise the
French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret
laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe
the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two countries. [We
need to build such trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point
when Americans and Chinese can trust one another like the French and
Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the 21st
century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only**]{.mark}
**viable [blueprint]{.mark}** for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered
by **[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world
are undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and
the world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel
the impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually [the **whole of humankind** will **feel
the squeeze**]{.underline}.

[[In a **brittle world**]{.mark} without enduring strong international
alliances]{.underline}, the debate on [Europe's 'strategic autonomy' has
gained **new resonance**, but it should not shadow the [EU's
**unique**]{.mark} **key international [assets]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
**global [economy]{.mark}** [and **multilat**]{.mark}**eral order**.
Working with **global networks** to [**promote norms** and **public
goods**]{.mark} is [key to **push back**]{.mark} **on
[nationalism]{.mark}**, the rise of **geopolitics** and
**transactionalism**.]{.underline}

Strategic autonomy' and 'complementarity with NATO' usually appear in
the same sentence in the European debate -- the latest doctrinal
iteration to be found in the EU Global Strategy of June 2016. The
ensemble reflects Europe's need to rely on its transatlantic
relationship for security and territorial defence, empowering it to
carry out foreign policy too. The EU's greatest foreign policy
achievement of enlarging to Central Europe after the Cold War, pursued
in tandem with NATO expansion, is testimony to this pairing.

Since the end of 2016, the US President's international preferences
undermine directly or indirectly Europe's security. Whether it is the
insistence on greater burden-sharing, US action in the Middle East, or
trade disputes with China, current US policies put Europe's security --
already challenged by Russian action in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East -- at risk.

European leaders have started to question whether the transatlantic
relationship needs to be preserved no matter what, or whether Europe
should emancipate from it. [The debate on 'strategic
autonomy']{.underline} is animating recent efforts in the field of
security and defence. It [refers to the ability to make and carry out
decisions on **defence**, to conduct **[military
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** autonomously, and to have the **industrial
capabilities** to do so. Even if]{.underline} this level of strategic
autonomy were [agreed upon, it would take a **generation** for Europe to
affect the world stage]{.underline}.

[The focus]{.underline} on strategic autonomy [[speak]{.mark}s
to]{.underline} present [insecurities in Europe]{.underline}an
societies, [but [not to]{.mark} the EU's **international
[legitimacy]{.mark}** [where]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly, [the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
[[has **better opportunities** to develop]{.mark} **means of political
[autonomy]{.mark}** which befit its **history** and **international
identity**]{.underline}. The emerging debate on economic sovereignty is
addressing for the first time the degree to which the EU can make
political use of some of its economic and financial tools, such as the
Euro as an international currency. After all, the EU and its Member
States remain the world's largest trade bloc and donor.

[On the multilateral stage, [Europe faces an **increasingly hostile
environment** but remains]{.mark} the **[best]{.mark} hope** [to
pursue]{.mark} **universal principles**, such as [**human rights**
and]{.mark} the [**rule of law**, which **underpin**]{.mark} **the
[resilience]{.mark}** of that **multilateral system**. How [to
**partner**]{.mark} **with other countries and actors** around the globe
[to **push back**]{.mark} **on [attacks to international order]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} no longer [a]{.mark} second order
[priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If the way ahead appears clear, achieving it is a tall order. The
rationale for collective action for the EU seems obvious -- the
'politics of scale', or to be stronger together rather than weaker apart
-- but historically difficult to achieve. [The multiple threats and
risks]{.underline} on Europe's doorsteps [have only minimally bridged
the strategic divergence that continues to beset the
continent]{.underline}, and [the rise of the populist radical right is
beginning to undermine existing European external policies, not to speak
of a higher level of ambition.]{.underline}

Looking at global politics from a non-European perspective, how Europe's
friends and partners around the world will welcome a bid for greater
autonomy -- politically, economically, and strategically -- still needs
to be seen. The EU's worldview that it has acted as a 'force for good'
is not uncritically accepted. After all, that ethical stand was also
possible thanks to the EU's belonging to a stable and hegemonic West.

If Europe wants to engage with the world and simultaneously strengthen
its strategic identity it needs to square some circles. [[Without giving
into]{.mark} the [**facile critique** that]{.mark} realism and
[geopolitics render multilat]{.mark}eral principles [obsolete]{.mark}
and warrant hard-nosed politics, [Europe should **leverage**]{.mark}
**its [assets]{.mark}**, which are irrevocably embedded [in]{.mark}
multilateralism and **[coop]{.mark}eration**. **[Climate]{.mark}
change**, **[conflict]{.mark} prevention and [mediation]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} an **[open]{.mark} and fairer international [trade]{.mark}
system** [are among]{.mark} the [assets]{.mark} that the [EU can]{.mark}
concretely [work towards]{.mark} globally]{.underline}.

To do so it needs to engage flexibly with global actors, focusing more
on multilevel networks including civil society rather than on the
traditional partnerships between governments, some of which are no
longer benign or useful. Both will require a dose of humility in
listening to non-European world views and of pragmatism in seeking
appropriate strategies and paths forward.

Last but not least, if [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} wants to imagine
its own history of prosperity, democracy and peace as still relevant to
the debates taking place in the rest of the world, it also [[needs to
think abou]{.mark}t the **[global]{.mark} future
[sustainability]{.mark}** of welfare]{.underline}, taking progressive
politics outside national boundaries and [[engaging in]{.mark} a more
global]{.underline} and open [debate about public [common
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Artificial Intelligence and DoD

The term artificial intelligence was first coined in 1956 at a
conference at Dartmouth College that showcased a program designed to
mimic human thinking skills.\[1\] Almost instantaneously, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) (then known as the Advanced
Research Projects Agency \[ARPA\]), the research arm of the military,
initiated several lines of research aimed at applying AI principles to
defense challenges (see Figure 1). Since the 1950s, AI --- and its
subdiscipline, machine learning (ML)\[2\] --- has come to mean many
different things to different people: For example, the 2019 NDAA cited
as many as five definitions of AI, and no consensus emerged on a common
definition from the dozens of interviews conducted by the RAND team for
its report to Congress.

To remain as flexible as possible, the [RAND study]{.underline} was not
bound by precise definitions, [ask]{.underline}ing instead, \"[[How
well]{.mark} is [DoD positioned]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[build]{.mark}**
or **[acquire]{.mark}**, **[test]{.mark}**, **transition**, [and
**sustain**]{.mark} --- at scale]{.underline} --- a set of technologies
broadly falling under the **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** umbrella\"? And
if those technologies fall short, what would DoD need to do to get
there?

**\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]**

The RAND team distilled the NDAA\'s mandate into the following three
guiding questions:

[What is the state of AI relevant to DoD?]{.underline}

[What is DoD\'s current posture in AI?]{.underline}

What internal actions, external engagements, and potential legislative
or regulatory actions might enhance DoD\'s posture in AI?

For the first question, the RAND team purposely avoided trying to
determine what technologies DoD should pursue or how DoD currently
measures up to other countries in terms of AI uptake because that was
outside their mandate. Rather, [the team assessed what DoD
decisionmakers need to know about AI.]{.underline}

For the second question, [the team **[assessed]{.mark}** the
**[posture]{.mark} of DoD** for AI [using]{.mark} a
**framewor[k]{.mark}** [of **six dimensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Table 1).

What Are the Recent Leap-Ahead Advances in AI and ML?

Deep learning, a form of supervised machine learning, trains
many-layered neural networks on large sets of labeled training data to
accomplish classification and prediction tasks, thereby offering new
solutions to long-standing image, text, and speech-recognition problems.

Deep reinforcement learning uses deep learning to solve for approximate
solutions of sequential decisionmaking problems with deferred rewards
and has applications in strategic and computer games.

What Decisionmakers Need to Know About AI

[Examining]{.underline} the implications of [AI for DoD and strategic
decisionmaking requires taking a holistic view that
considers]{.underline} three critical elements and how they interact:

- the [technology and capabilities]{.underline} space

- the [spectrum of DoD AI applications]{.underline}

- the [investment space and time horizon]{.underline}.

The [technologies and capabilities]{.underline} space: This [includes
the approaches, such as algorithms, that underpin current AI
solutions]{.underline}. Although many technologies underpin AI, current
interest (and hype) is fueled by advances in a small number of areas,
like deep learning.

But [success in deep learning [requires **large data sets**]{.mark}.
Deep learning algorithms tend to be highly specific to the applications
for which they were designed, and demonstrated applications have tended
to be commercial]{.underline}. What\'s more, [VVT&E [remains]{.mark}
**very [challenging across the board]{.mark}** for all AI applications,
including safety-critical military applications.]{.underline}

**\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]**

The [spectrum of DoD applications]{.underline}: The spectrum of DoD AI
applications [can be characterized by]{.underline} where those
applications fall in terms of four independent factors: [operating
environment, resources, tempo, and implications of failure]{.underline}
(see Figure 2). The position on this spectrum can be summarized in terms
of three overlapping bins:

- [enterprise AI]{.underline}, consisting of such applications as the
  management of health records at military hospitals in well-controlled,
  slower-paced environments, where analysts and decisionmakers have
  access to ample computational resources, data might be considered
  recoverable, and implications of failure might be negligible

- [mission-support AI]{.underline}, consisting of applications like the
  Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, also known as Project
  Maven, which aims to use ML to assist humans in analyzing large
  quantities of imagery from full-motion video data collected in the
  battle theater by drones

- [[operational AI, consist]{.mark}ing [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
  applications of AI integrated into weapon systems that must contend
  with [dynamic, adversarial environments; fast tempo; scarce
  computational and communication resources (and]{.underline} possibly
  [data]{.underline}); [and [**significant** implications of
  **failure**]{.mark} for casualties and risks to strategic
  objectives]{.underline}.

The investment space and time horizon: In addition to the investments
needed to develop or acquire AI technologies across the spectrum of
applications, [success in AI requires]{.underline} the following three
other kinds of [investments]{.underline}:

- [technological and other enablers]{.underline}, such as infrastructure
  to enable the collection and management of data

- [VVT&E foundations and practice for technological checks and
  balances]{.underline}

- [foundational basic research that is not specifically aligned with a
  particular product or application to maintain longer-term
  technological superiority.]{.underline}

Finally, to manage expectations and ensure continued support, it is
important to set realistic goals for the lead times that AI will need to
progress from demonstrations of what is possible to full-scale
implementations in the field. The RAND team\'s analysis suggests that,
as a rule of thumb, sustained DoD investments made as of the time of the
original report\'s publication (2019) can be expected to yield at-scale
deployments in the

- near term (up to five years) for enterprise AI

- middle term (five to ten years) for most mission-support AI

- far term (longer than ten years) for most operational AI applications.

Of course, DoD can expect and should pursue faster progress for some
applications, even within operational AI. However, these timelines
reflect the RAND team\'s assessment of what reasonable expectations are,
given the current state of the technology and taking into account the
four factors discussed previously: operating environment, resources,
tempo, and implications of failure.

DoD\'s Posture for AI

Overall, the RAND team found that, despite some positive signs, [[DoD\'s
posture is]{.mark} **significantly [challenged]{.mark}** [**across all
dimensions** of]{.mark} the **posture
[assessment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[Organizationally]{.underline}**, at the DoD level, [the current DoD
AI strategy [lacks]{.mark} both **[baselines]{.mark}** and
**[metrics]{.mark}** for **assessing progress**.]{.underline} Thus far,
[the **JAIC** has [no]{.mark}t been given the **[authority]{.mark}**,
**[resources]{.mark}**, and **[visibility]{.mark}** needed [to **scale
AI**]{.mark} and its impact **DoD-wide**. [Similar challenges]{.mark}
are seen [at]{.mark} the level of the **individual
[services]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[**Data** are]{.mark} often **[lacking]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and when
they exist, [they often [lack **traceability**]{.mark},
**[understandability]{.mark}**, **[accessibility]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and interoperability.

The [**current state** of **VVT&E** for AI technologies **[cannot
ensure]{.mark}** the [**performance** and **safety**]{.mark} of AI
systems, especially those that are safety-critical.]{.underline}

[DoD **[lacks]{.mark} clear [mechanisms]{.mark}** [for
**growing**]{.mark}, **tracking**, and **cultivating [AI]{.mark}
talent**, a challenge that is only going to grow with the increasingly
[tight competition with]{.mark} **academia**, the **commercial** world,
and [other]{.mark}]{.underline} kinds of [[**workspaces** for
individuals]{.mark} with the needed **skills** and
**training**]{.underline}.

[**[Communications]{.mark} channels** among the builders and users of AI
within DoD [are **sparse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Current [DoD **practices** and **[processes]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
or their **[implementation]{.underline}** --- might be
**[[hamper]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[innovation]{.mark} **within DoD**
and **[inhibiting]{.mark}** DoD\'s **ability** to bring in **external
[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Despite some positive signs, [DoD is **poorly positioned** across **all
dimensions** to effectively **leverage** and **scale AI**.]{.underline}
The report offered a set of recommendations, both strategic and
tactical, for moving forward.

Approach

The starting point of our study was the underlying premise, implicit in
the language of Section 238 of the FY 2019 NDAA, that DoD needs to be
competitively positioned for AI. Motivated in part by the desire to
remain agnostic about the precise definition of AI, [we posed the
question: How well is DoD positioned to build or acquire, test,
transition, and sustain---at scale---a set of technologies falling under
the broad AI umbrella]{.underline}?

[We distilled the information needed to answer that]{.underline}
question [into **six dimensions** that form the **analytical
[framework]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} our **posture
[assessment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These are
**[[organization]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([executive-level view of DoD,
including vision, strategy, organizational structures, and resources
committed]{.underline}); **[[advancement]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([research, development, [prototyping]{.mark}, and
**[v]{.mark}**erification, **[v]{.mark}**alidation,
**[t]{.mark}**esting, and **[e]{.mark}**valuation of the
technology]{.underline}); **[[adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([tech]{.underline}nology [procurement, fielding, and life-cycle
management and redesign]{.underline} of concepts and processes [to make
best use of the technologies]{.underline});
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([**[internal]{.mark} culture**
for innovation [and]{.mark} **mechanisms** for bringing in
**[external]{.mark} innovations** or **innovators**]{.underline});
**[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}** (data [as a
**[resource]{.mark}**]{.underline}, data
**[[governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and supporting
[**infrastructure** allowing the **[leveraging]{.mark} of
data**]{.underline}); [and **[talent]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([DoD needs
and mechanisms for **cultivating** and **growing talent**)]{.underline}.

[We initiated four [**parallel data collection** and
**analysis**]{.mark} **efforts**. The first line of effort collected
input from **59 [DoD]{.mark} interviews** and nine other
**[federal]{.mark} government interviews**]{.underline} relating to all
six dimensions of posture assessment to help us better understand the
current DoD and federal landscape. [The second line of effort collected
input from 25 **[industry]{.mark} interviews** [and]{.mark} nine
**[academic interviews]{.mark}**]{.underline} relating to all six
dimensions of posture assessment to help us better understand best
practices and lessons learned. The third line of effort developed [six
[historical **case studies**]{.mark}]{.underline} to help us understand
lessons learned from history that might be extrapolated to the current
posture assessment. The [**data** and **insights** from these three
lines of effort were **synthesized** and **supplemented** by two
additional sources]{.underline}: first, [the team's
**[technical]{.mark}** and other **[expertise]{.mark}**, and second, our
[**consultation** of]{.mark} the **[literature]{.mark}**. Emerging
themes and evidence across these **multiple sources** were then used as
the basis for our assessments of the state of AI and DoD's posture in
AI]{.underline}, and to develop a set of recommendations.1 [The fourth
effort was a [quantitative **assessment** of **DoD's**]{.mark} current
**[investment]{.mark} portfolio** in AI]{.underline}; that effort is
discussed in an annex to this report that is not publicly available.

### 1nc -- no operationalization

Conflict can be won or lost based on military offsets, or means with
which defense units can asymmetrically combat adversarial advantages.
With great-power competition, adversarial technology overmatch, and
ever-expanding theaters, conventional offsets are often augmented by
artificial intelligence (AI).1 Yet, the Department of Defense's
(**[DOD]{.underline}**) [[ability to **operationalize**]{.mark} **AI**
[is **nascent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 [Initial **AI programs** adopted
by the **Pentagon** focus on the **transfer** of **commercial
capabilities** to the defense sector]{.underline}, thus [highlighting
technical performance and deemphasizing mission-oriented
function]{.underline}.3 As a result, [initial **[pilot
projects]{.mark}** have [**failed** to move into real-world]{.mark}
**operational environments** ([OE]{.mark})]{.underline}.

Operationalizing Artificial Intelligence

Operationalization hinges on the understanding that AI is not an end
state but rather one way of achieving a military advantage. To that end,
[the technical **execution** of AI-related methodologies must be
**married** to the **OE**. This consideration **diverges** from
**traditional thought** because **AI solutions** are typically developed
to achieve a certain **statistical threshold**]{.underline} (e.g.,
recall, precision), [rather than a **military objective**]{.underline}
([e.g., increased standoff distance]{.underline}).4

This dynamic is confounded by the term "algorithmic warfare," which
currently conflates technical and military characterizations.
[[Algorithmic warfare]{.mark} intends to reduce the number of
warfighters in harm's way, increase decision speed in time-critical
operations, and operate when and where humans are unable to
operate.]{.underline}5 Yet, [**none** of those **objectives** speak to
**mathematics** or **comp**uter **sci**ence; they are [grounded squarely
in **military**]{.mark} **end states**]{.underline}. The problem is that
[the [**bridge** between **science**, **tech**]{.mark}nology,
**[engineering]{.mark}**, and **mathematics** disciplines [and
**military**]{.mark} **end states** [was never established]{.mark}
before the **Pentagon** embarked on its **AI trajectory**.]{.underline}

[The **desired bridge** is a framework for **guiding** and **assessing
AI [operationalization]{.mark}**, with **algorithm performance** on one
side and **mission utility** on the other. Such a combination ensures
that mathematical equations can prove or numerically validate an AI
system while qualitative benchmarks guarantee practical application. The
result is algorithmic warfare [based]{.mark} not just [on **statistics**
but]{.mark} a **broader [architecture]{.mark}** [for **operational
relevancy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That relevancy is couched in five
requirements:

- minimum viability,

- the ability to adapt to unknown and unknowable scenarios,

- the prioritization of insight over information,

- the requisite level of autonomy for the application, and

- battlefield readiness.

For the first time, such [requirements **[lay]{.mark} the
[foundation]{.mark}** [for **assessing**]{.mark} **military
[AI]{.mark}** programs [and **defining success**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Data

The [study team interviewed and collected **input** from many **[DoD
stakeholders]{.mark}** with **responsibility** for **data** and
**infrastructure**]{.underline}. The team also [interviewed DoD
personnel who use these data and infrastructure for analytics or AI
purposes.]{.underline} One striking aspect of our interviews was the
general enthusiasm expressed for the JCF, with "wish lists" that
included the development of uniform policies for sandboxing and
application programming interfaces,32 the development of common
algorithm libraries and repositories for open source projects, and reuse
of code components and documentation of best practices (see section
"Organization: At the OSD Level" in Appendix B). A notable development
within DoD is the recent creation of the CDO role, with Michael Conlin
in place as DoD's first CDO as of August 2018. We anticipate that with
time, the data posture of DoD will significantly evolve. Nonetheless,
through our interviews, [we [identified]{.mark} several serious
**[obstacles]{.mark}** and **impediments** in regard to **data** at
present]{.underline}.

[[Data]{.mark} are [**not collected** and **stored**]{.mark} at **every
opportunity**]{.underline}. DoD's [software infrastructure exists in an
environment in which **[storage]{.mark} space** [remains]{.mark} a
**[scarce]{.mark}** resource and many [**opportunities** to
**record**]{.mark} **data** [are **missed**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even
if modern storage infrastructure capacities were acquired, additional
barriers might prevent the mass collection and storage of data. In
particular, [DoD still faces significant [constraints on]{.mark}
**network [bandwidth]{.mark}**, which can hamper the ability to move
data collected from sensors in the field to a location where they can be
stored.]{.underline} Additionally, [DoD's **suite of software** was
designed for and implemented in an era in which applications stored only
data for which DoD had an immediate use, rather than **speculatively
storing** data that could be **mined** for **insights** by
**professionals**. This situation has [resulted]{.mark} both [in
**inadequate**]{.mark} **data [storage]{.mark}** and in storage of
**[less-appropriate data]{.mark}**]{.underline}; in addition, [too much
of the data collected have already been **transformed** from a **raw**,
**foundational form** into an **intermediate** or **aggregated
result**]{.underline}. These [transformations]{.underline}, although an
appropriate optimization at the time, [[strip away]{.mark} **crucial
[context]{.mark}** from information [needed to **train**]{.mark} modern
**ML-based [algorithms]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Finally,
[**[outdated]{.mark}** collection [processes result in some]{.mark} data
[not]{.mark} being **collected** and
**[digitized]{.mark}**]{.underline}; recent RAND work on acquisition
data within DoD illustrates this point.33

#### 2 -- [accessibility]{.underline} -- it's [limited]{.underline} for [existing data]{.underline}

[**[Access]{.mark}** to existing data [is
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Several barriers within DoD present
substantial obstacles to data-sharing today. First, [personnel might
view data as a means of **retaining power** or **value** in DoD or of
**protecting** their work from **extensive oversight**]{.underline}, and
therefore those [**[personnel resist]{.mark}**
data-sharing]{.underline}. Additionally, many [[data owners
resist]{.mark} sharing their data out of security concerns and the worry
that another organization might suffer a security breach]{.underline}.
Finally, [the **[security clearance]{.mark} process** and other
**[bureaucratic procedures]{.mark}** can [introduce]{.mark} a
**significant [lag]{.mark}** before an individual will be allowed to
access data. This problem [presents]{.mark} a **particular
[difficulty]{.mark}** [in **recruiting**]{.mark} **new [talent]{.mark}**
into DoD, and substantially **[lowers
productivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even for long-standing DoD
personnel. Some of these issues, as they pertain to acquisition data,
were highlighted in a recent RAND report.34 Informal networks can
substantially reduce the delay in gaining access to data, but based on
our interviews, these [workarounds appear to be
**haphazard**]{.underline}.

#### 3 -- interoperability -- it's are [inconsistent]{.underline} -- establishing [relationships]{.underline} across data collected by different systems is [impossible]{.underline}, turns case

[**[Lack of interoperability]{.mark} in systems** across DoD **[creates
challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Interoperability of [data collected
by different systems, even within the same functional domain, remains a
**problem**. Software applications]{.underline} within DoD [have not
typically been designed to work with other DoD
applications---even]{.underline} applications [in the same **functional
domain**.]{.underline} Consequently, [[establishing
relationships]{.mark} between data collected by one system and data
collected by another can be **[virtually
impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even worse, it appears that [DoD
[leadership is]{.mark} often [presented with **inconsistent
values**]{.mark} originating from different systems for the same data
point, **[undermining]{.mark} leadership's [willingness]{.mark}** [to
**trust data**]{.mark} from DoD systems [or **make decisions based on
data**]{.mark} at all]{.underline} (see section "Data" in Appendix B).

#### 4 -- [traceability]{.underline} AND [comprehensibility]{.underline} -- collection does NOT include [context]{.underline} -- makes [leveraging it impossible]{.underline} -- NO implementation of algorithms

<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4229.html>, nihara

The [**[data]{.mark}** that exist are [not]{.mark} always
[**understandable** or **traceable**]{.mark}. DoD systems frequently
[lack]{.mark} the **documentation** or **metadata** required to provide
**[context]{.mark}** as to what particular data actually
**mean**]{.underline} or how they were generated. For example, an Army
database might store a numeric value for the number of tanks at a
particular facility, but it might not explain whether this number
indicates all functional tanks, all tanks assigned to a particular unit,
or all tanks of any status present at the location. [Other data values
with less descriptive names will frequently be even more [difficult to
comprehend and]{.mark} [use]{.mark}. The **lack** of any **centralized
tool** for data service means that it is **[difficult]{.mark}** for
**DoD personnel**, even in **leadership**, [to discover what data
might]{.mark} be **available to [inform]{.mark}** a
question.]{.underline} Instead, [discovering **new data** sources and
**interpreting them** typically requires **personal networks** or other
**informal mechanisms**]{.underline}.

In sum, all indications are that [DoD [data]{.mark} are not currently
being used to their full potential]{.underline}. Overall, the problems
we noted here [[represent]{.mark} a [**formidable obstacle** to
**implementing**]{.mark} **AI [algorithms]{.mark}**]{.underline},35 even
at the level of enterprise AI. Both Project Maven and the JAIC's
preventative maintenance prototype have found that [issues around **data
quality** and **availability** are a **[primary barrier to
progress]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see section "Data" in Appendix B).
[These **issues**, if left **unresolved**, will continue to
**[hamper]{.mark}** the **[development]{.mark}** and
**[deployment]{.mark}** of AI throughout DoD.]{.underline} Additionally,
we highlight the following friction point.

#### 5 -- [ambiguity]{.underline} -- [directly implicates]{.underline} any [external]{.underline} OR [private sector involvement]{.underline} -- pilot projects that collaborate with industry fail AND are [NOT operationalizable]{.underline} because of data ownership [vendor lock]{.underline}

There is [[**ambiguity** in **data ownership** where **external
vendors** are involved]{.underline}]{.mark}. In theory, data that
originate in DoD should be owned by DoD. In practice, [when DoD data are
**analyzed** or otherwise **worked on** by **external vendors**, the
**ownership** of the data, albeit in a new modified form, becomes
**murky**]{.underline}. This issue was highlighted in recent unpublished
RAND work addressing weapon system intellectual property and data
rights. This [ambiguity of ownership [leads to]{.mark} **multiple
problems** beyond the specific ownership and potential [**loss of
control** of]{.mark} the data, including **[vendor lock]{.mark}** to
**retain use** of the data, the [**inability** to **aggregate**]{.mark}
data [across]{.mark} **multiple [vendors]{.mark}**, and the
[**inability** to use]{.mark} the [data for **additional**]{.mark}
**internal [purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, among others. Although this
problem is not unique to DoD, as some of our industry interviewees
described (see section "Industry: Data" in Appendix C), it is one that
DoD also needs to come to terms with.

[[DoD **lacks**]{.mark} **clear [mechanisms]{.mark}** [for **defining**
and **tracking**]{.mark} **AI [talent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
situation is [because of the [lack of]{.mark} an AI **workforce
[classification]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the lack of [**consensus**
on]{.mark} the [**definition** and]{.mark} **[requisite]{.mark} skills**
of an **AI worker**]{.underline}. Currently, [the technical AI
[talent]{.mark} that exists [is being **placed inconsistently**]{.mark}
in military and civilian occupational specialtie]{.underline}s.

For example, our interviewees across the services noted that civilian AI
talent is found across occupations, including operations researchers,
program analysts, scientists, software developers, and engineers. On the
uniformed side, the Army and Navy are actively considering a new
occupational specialty for servicemembers just for AI, but the Air Force
and Marines are not. Adding to this complicated picture, some existing
uniformed and civilian occupations that might have a role to play in
developing AI technologies, such as software engineers, are classified
as cyber talent (see section "DoD Posture for Cyber" in Appendix D). On
this note, although it is not prevalent, we observed an inclination
among some of our interviewees to view AI, software, cyber, and data
science as somewhat interchangeable, particularly with regard to
technical talent.37

[DoD [struggles to **grow** and **cultivate**]{.mark} **AI
[talent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our interviews suggest a [mixed
appreciation for what technical AI talent consists of and which AI
talent is needed]{.underline}. Several entities we interviewed, such as
the service labs, had a clear sense of AI talent needs, but the
[**majority** were still in the beginning stages of such considerations
and were more likely to **emphasize [contracting o]{.mark}ut** for
technical talent]{.underline}. Moreover, for those that were clear on AI
talent needs, [it was a **[challenge to define]{.mark}** the exact
**[knowledge]{.mark}**, **[skills]{.mark}**, and **[abilities]{.mark}**
they perceived that were required]{.underline}. Ultimately, [the AI
talent needs of DoD]{.underline} (type,38 quantity, and mix) [will
depend on the **broader strategy** pursued for **scaling AI**, and the
extent to which [scaling AI]{.mark} will [rely on the **development** of
products **in-house**]{.mark} as opposed to through **contracting** and
**outsourcing**]{.underline}. The [skill sets needed for development of
products in-house are **significantly different** from those needed for
contracting and outsourcing, though all **AI [talent]{.mark}**
(technical or managerial) is **[difficult to access]{.mark}** in the
present market.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the [consensus is that **[DoD
faces stiff competition]{.mark}** for AI skills and expertise, as
evidenced by our interviews across academia, industry, and
DoD]{.underline}.39 Many of our DoD interviewees discussed the
challenges related to attracting and recruiting technical talent more
generally, and expressed the belief that AI talent would be no
different. In that spirit, we point to a recent RAND study on career
paths for data scientists within the Defense Intelligence Agency.40
Interviews across DoD cited [**intense competition** with the **private
sector**, the [**limited ability** to **compete on salary**, and **long
hiring**]{.mark} **processes**]{.underline}. At the same time, the
majority of our interviewees were optimistic that DoD could compete well
on mission and the opportunity to work on important and interesting
problems (see section "Talent" in Appendix B, and section "Thoughts
Across Industry: On DoD Competing for AI Talent" in Appendix C).41 We
note that similar themes to the ones we highlight here appear in the
DIB's SWAP study, even as we reemphasize that AI is not software.42

Overall, the services generally acknowledged the need for greater
permeability of technical talent between civilians and uniformed
services.43 Several interviewees expressed the belief that they need to
exploit existing authorities for civilians to do a tour of duty for
several years at DoD, with one noting they would be more than happy to
take technical talent that was "burned out" in industry or academic jobs
and wanted a change. This idea complements what we heard from industry
and academia, where a variety of mechanisms are used to support external
activity of employees in the interests of retaining them (see section
"Academia: Talent" in Appendix C, and section "Industry: Talent" in
Appendix C). Interviewees also described retention efforts for current
service members with technical skills; these efforts leverage existing
programs that enable some degree of permeability. This process includes
formal training and rotation opportunities for officers in technical
disciplines through established partnerships with industry and
academia.44 A recent congressionally mandated RAND study catalogues more
examples of such rotation programs.45 Regardless of the approach taken,
[if [DoD]{.mark} is to be **successful** in scaling AI, it [needs to
**ensure**]{.mark} it has [**access** to]{.mark} some level of **AI
[talent]{.mark}**, both **[technical]{.mark}** (**R&D**) [and
**managerial**]{.mark} (**acquisition**), and that the talent that
exists **maintains** its **knowledge** and **skills** in a
**fast-changing technical environment**]{.underline}. DoD also needs to
cultivate respect of and promotions for military personnel involved in
AI activities and [to compete in an AI talent market]{.underline} in
which individuals expect change (in jobs and employers) every few years.

In 1983, the U.S. [[military's **r**]{.mark}esearch [**and**
**d**]{.mark}evelopment]{.underline} arm began a ten-year, \$1 billion
machine intelligence program aimed at keeping the United States ahead of
its technological rivals. From the start, computer scientists criticized
the project as unrealistic. It [[**promised big** and]{.mark} ultimately
**[failed]{.mark} hard**]{.underline} in the eyes of the [Pentagon,
ushering in]{.underline} a long artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**) "**[winter]{.underline}**" during which potential
[**[funders]{.mark}**, including the]{.underline} U.S. [military,
**[shied away]{.mark}** from big **investments** in the field and
**[abandoned]{.mark}**]{.underline} promising areas of
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Today, [AI]{.underline} is once again the darling of the national
security services. And once again, it [risks sliding
backward]{.underline} [as a result of]{.underline} a destructive
"**[[hype cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in which
**[overpromising]{.mark}** conspires with **inevitable setbacks** to
[undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**long-term [success]{.mark}** of a
**transformative** new **tech**nology. Military powers]{.underline}
around the world [are investing heavily in AI]{.underline}, seeking
battlefield and other security applications that might provide an
advantage over potential adversaries. In the United States, [there is a
growing sense of urgency]{.underline} around AI, and rightly so. As
former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper put it, "Those who are first to
harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive
advantage on the battlefield for years to come." However, [there is a
very real risk that **[expectations]{.mark}** are being [set **too
high** and]{.mark} that an **un[willingness]{.mark}** [to **tolerate
failures**]{.mark} will mean the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**[squanders]{.mark} AI's [potential]{.mark}**
and **falls behind** its **rivals**.]{.underline}

ACCIDENTS HAPPEN

The path to the effective uses of military AI will inevitably be rocky,
with [[**accidents** and **missteps**]{.mark} amplified by
overhyping]{.underline} of the sort that has seen, for example, outsize
excitement over futuristic, fully autonomous cars give way to the
mundane reality of vehicles that can just about parallel park. A
[**mismatch** between **expectations** and **reality** can [spell the
**end**]{.mark} for **new tech**nologies and is especially likely to do
so when [governments **prioritize quick wins**]{.mark} over **long-term
potential**. **[Successful]{.mark}** AI [adoption]{.mark} will [require
**patience**]{.mark} and **careful communication** so that
**opportunistic naysayers** cannot hold up **accidents** as **proof**
that **failure is inevitable**.]{.underline}

[AI might be especially [**vulnerable** to]{.mark} this type of
**hype-induced [backsliding]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It has [suffered two
previous **winters**]{.underline} in its relatively short history,
during which [AI's **failure** to live up to [**expectations** drove
**declines** in **funding** and **interest**]{.mark}. AI is also tricky
to **understand** and to **define**, and the **algorithms** on which it
is based are **prone to [failure]{.mark}** when used
**[outside]{.mark}** the [**context** of]{.mark} their **initial
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**[Incorporating]{.mark}** AI into the U.S.
**[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, moreover, [will [require
**disruptive changes**]{.mark} to everything from force **structure**
and **promotion** patterns to **doctrine** and **responsibility**. This
will inevitably **[trigger resistance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And
[because U.S. **defense [officials]{.mark}** generally **[lack]{.mark}**
the **[expertise]{.mark}** to **assess AI advances** currently being
driven by the **private sector**, opponents of the new technology will
find it easier to **capitalize** on **inevitable setbacks**,
arguing]{.underline} that [a potentially effective application of AI is
not just too early but will **never materialize**.]{.underline}

Yet the naysayers cannot be allowed to triumph. Over and over throughout
history, resistance to technological change has come back to haunt
militaries. In the late nineteenth century, for instance, France's navy
sought to counter British naval supremacy by investing heavily in
submarines and torpedo boats. The technology of the time was not up to
the task, however, and France reverted to building battleships, a move
that left the United Kingdom to rule the waves until the outbreak of
World War II.

About 25 years later, Russia abandoned early design armored vehicles
because they got stuck in the mud. Better tread and more power were the
simple fixes. But instead, Russia put off procurement of the vehicles
and fell behind as others moved forward. In short order, the armored
vehicle evolved into the tank, a critical innovation in ground warfare.
The Russians, like the French, ought to have shown more patience and
persistence.

STUMBLING BLOCKS

There are [three main [**chokepoints** at]{.mark} which]{.underline} new
technologies such as [AI]{.underline} often [fall short of inflated
expectations and]{.underline} therefore [**backslide** into]{.underline}
the abyss of [premature **[abandonment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The first
is the "**[[valley of death]{.underline}]{.mark}**," the appropriately

**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the **private sector**

If the valley of death is safely navigated, a [**[cumbersome]{.mark}**

can be the next trap]{.underline}. The U.S. **[D]{.underline}**epartment

Online [[misinformation about the armies of Poland and Finland has
circulated]{.mark} online [amid Russia\'s invasion]{.mark} of
Ukraine.]{.underline}

Social media users have falsely suggested that both European Union
member states are preparing to enter the war or engage in military
conflict.

[Investigations by Euronews and other independent fact-checkers have
revealed that [the claims are false]{.mark} and alleged video evidence
has been taken out of context.]{.underline}

In times of conflict and crisis, when people are hungry for details
about the war, [[misinformation can be equally as viral as verified
facts]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Both Moscow and Kyiv have used social media to spread their propaganda,
while pro-Kremlin users have also spread false claims.]{.underline}

Poland is NOT preparing to invade Ukrainian territory

A recent viral video has falsely claimed that Poland is preparing to
send troops into Western Ukraine to confront Russia.

The footage \-- which includes the logo and branding of BBC News \--
alleges that Poland\'s military general Yaroslav Mika had signed an
order to put army sections on "full alert".

The video was shared online by users in a number of languages, including
Czech, French, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Turkish.

But online searches show no record of the BBC ever producing a report on
the story, and senior disinformation journalists at the company state
that the video is \"fake\".

The branding of the BBC was also previously used to spread false claims
about military strikes on a Kramamtorsk railway station that killed
dozens of people.

Poland has led calls for the EU to toughen sanctions on Russia and for
the NATO alliance to arm Ukraine during the war.

While Poland has provided its neighbour with military aid, it has not
expressed any such plans to send troops into Ukrainian territory.

The General Command of the Polish Armed Forces dismissed the allegations
and stated that any alleged order to move troops was \"counterfeit\".

\"This is a false order of the Polish General Staff, the whole document
is fake,\" its official Twitter account said.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that hostile rhetoric
was coming out of Poland and suggested that Warsaw could be \"a source
of threat\".

[[Polish government officials say Moscow]{.mark} and pro-Kremlin social
media users are [now launching information attacks against the
country.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"The fake order of the Polish general, created for propaganda purposes,
was used for disinformation activities against Poland,\" said Stanisław
Żaryn, a spokesman for Poland\'s Special Services Ministry.

[\"The order was used to legitimise insinuations about Poland\'s plans
to attack western Ukraine,\"]{.underline} he said on Twitter.

\"\[[These\] are all elements indicating that [Russia is conducting **a
coordinated information operation against
Poland**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[[Warsaw]{.mark} says it [has recently stepped up efforts to
combat]{.mark} the spread of \"disinformation\" being spread by

WHAT FDPR EXPORT CONTROLS CAN DO

[Any deployment of [FDPR export controls would significantly reduce the
Kremlin's ability to keep pace]{.mark} with the global race to
capitalize on AI technologies [by throttling Russia's access to the
underlying hardware]{.mark} that make those AI technologies
possible]{.underline}. Insofar as [[AI technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}
require prodigious amounts of data to function properly, they [[are
**fundamentally reliant on computer microprocessors**]{.mark} able to
manipulate massive volumes of digital information swiftly and at
scale.]{.underline}

[[The Russian computer chip industry]{.mark} is dominated by two
companies, Baikal Electronics and the Moscow Center of SPARC
Technologies (MCST), both of which [rely on]{.mark} the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ([TSMC) to fabricate their chip
designs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite its complicated role in the Biden
administration's plans to secure global semiconductor supply lines, TSMC
is an important geopolitical actor in its own right by virtue of its
position as the leading manufacturer of the semiconductors used by
computer chip companies worldwide. Nonetheless, [[the FDPR]{.mark}'s
statutory basis [will]{.mark} likely c[ompel TSMC and]{.mark} most other
key points in [the global semiconductor supply chain to shutter their
dealings with MCST and Baikal Electronics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In keeping with the logic of import substitution policies
(importozameshchenie) adopted in response to the imposition of western
sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin
seeks to stimulate semiconductor production capabilities to compensate
for losing access to TSMC and other overseas chip manufacturers. Russian
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin's ambitious roadmap for this effort,
first presented in January 2020, aims to curtail Russia's reliance on
international semiconductor supply chains through import substitution,
competition for global chip markets, and, ideally, eventual market
dominance. Putin's October 2019 AI strategy also prescribes the rollout
of domestically-manufactured microprocessors "not inferior to their
global equivalents as far as speed and energy efficiency."

RUSSIA'S AI INVESTMENTS

A handful of semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs) already exist
inside Russia. For example, in November 2021, fabs operated by Mikron
--- a subsidiary of Rostec, a state-owned technology company subject to
US sanctions since 2014 --- reportedly completed an experimental batch
of the MK32 Amur, the first ever microcontroller chip entirely designed
and produced inside Russia. Although fabs like those operated by Mikron
require substantial capital investments over time lest they become
obsolete, Russia's international reserves currently total more than
\$600 billion --- a sum that should enable the Kremlin to subsidize fab
development and maintenance for some time. In fact, Russia plans to
invest RUB 768.5 million (approximately \$9.6 million in US dollars) in
information technology infrastructure by 2024. These plans appear to
include recruiting foreign talent. For example, in September 2021,
Russian media reported that the Ministry for Manufacturing and Trade had
partnered with VEB.RF (formerly Vneshekonombank) to recruit several
specialists from Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer United
Microelectronics Corporation as part of an effort to relaunch a bankrupt
chip plant outside Moscow.

Whether these investments will immediately translate into chipsets
capable of providing the computing power AI technologies require remains
an open question. A chip's computing power is generally measured in
terms of the length of its transistor gates, which govern the flow of
electricity and thereby control the flow of information through a
computer system. The smaller the transistor gate, the more transistors
that can fit onto a single chip, thus enabling greater computing power
and energy efficiency per individual chip. At the time of this writing,
the most advanced mass market chips used for AI applications, such as
AMD's Radeon Instinct family of graphics processing units (GPU) and
Huawei's Ascend 910 processors, feature transistor components measuring
approximately 7 nanometers (nm). By contrast, [Russian media reports
indicate that the [components composing Mikron's MK32 Amur]{.mark}
microcontroller [measure]{.mark} approximately [90
nm]{.mark}]{.underline}. For context, [[90 nm chipsets]{.mark} [provided
the computing power behind the Sony PlayStation 3]{.mark} upon that
console's release [in]{.mark} November **[2006]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In this sense, [[the MK32 Amur]{.mark}, though ostensibly a success in
terms of Russian import substitution strategies, [has specifications
that fall well short of US and Chinese-manufactured AI
chips]{.mark}]{.underline}, which suggests that existing Russian fabs
are several generations old.

[Even if the Kremlin manages to parlay its international reserves into
developing more advanced fabs, [there is no guarantee that Russian chip
companies can produce reliable designs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian
business daily Kommersant has reported that the Ministry of Internal
Affairs, among other key government organs and state-owned enterprises
have encountered extensive problems with the latest generation of MCST's
flagship Elbrus family of microprocessors. According to anonymous
sources familiar with the situation, the issues with MCST's chips are so
grave as to have convinced major economic actors like Rostec and Sber
(formerly Sberbank) to refrain from fully embracing domestically
produced microprocessors until the latter's computing capacities become
more reliable without them becoming more expensive than foreign
analogues.

Minpromtorg has even gone so far as to file a civil lawsuit demanding
that the Isaac S. Bruk Institute of Electronic Control Machines (IECM),
MCST's parent institution, pay back RUB 325.5 million, which is
approximately \$4.1 million in US dollars as of Feb. 21 2022 in
subsidies along with RUB 92.3 million (approximately \$1.2 million US
dollars) in additional fines. Although limited information is available
regarding the legal action under concern, CNews.ru reports that
Minpromtorg --- which has also filed similar lawsuits against Baikal
Electronics and Russian supercomputer firm T-Platforms --- originally
extended the subsidies as part of a program to develop a massively
scalable server system employing MCST's Elbrus 8S microprocessor chip
for use in the kind of data center and supercomputer equipment utilized
in AI applications.

Equally debatable is the argument that sanctions will catalyze import
substitution policies mitigating Russia's reliance on imports of chips.
The available evidence suggests that this is not the case: Data
collected by the International Trade Center, an international
development agency run jointly by the World Trade Organization and the
UNs, shows that [[Russian import of semiconductor]{.mark} devices and
electronic integrated circuits actually **[grew by 47 % and 50
%]{.mark}** respectively, [between 2014 and 2019]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Russian security services observer Andrei Soldatov maintains that the
Kremlin has actually made considerable progress in hi-tech import
substitution since 2019; however, most of the progress that Soldatov
references concerns the development of alternatives to western online
platforms and other consumer-oriented applications, rather than the sort
of high-caliber semiconductors required to support advanced AI
functionalities.

The Kremlin could turn to Chinese semiconductor manufacturers for
AI-capable chipsets, though [[it is by no means certain that Beijing
would allow domestic chip fabricators to supply Russia]{.mark} ---
[especially if it meant running afoul of FDPR controls]{.mark} and
[depriving]{.mark} Chinese companies of [access to US
tech]{.mark}nology, [financing, and markets]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the notion that using Chinese technology serves the interests
of the Kremlin's AI development strategy, and its much-touted "digital
sovereignty" policy more broadly, better than using US-derived analogues
may be a hard sell for elements within the Russian security
elite]{.underline}, not least given that both of the above scenarios
essentially entail reliance on a foreign power for sensitive hardware.

Finally, while [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has less overall AI
talent than]{.mark} the [Europe]{.mark}an Union]{.underline}, its talent
is more elite.\[6\]

[[China is ahead of]{.mark} the [Europe]{.mark}an Union in AI a[nd
appears to be **quickly reducing the gap** between itself and the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} It has more access to data
than the European Union and the United States, which is important
because many of today's AI systems use large datasets to train their

[The [Europe]{.mark}an Union [**has the talent** to compete]{.mark} with

[In light of the [AI white paper,]{.mark} it [appears]{.mark}
that]{.underline} [the Commission is moving forward with broad,
horizontal, and relatively [intrusive regulation of AI]{.mark}
applications]{.underline}. [Ex-ante conformity assessments to control
access to the EU market for AI applications originating outside of the
EU are proposed.]{.underline} The Commission is also considering data
quality and traceability requirements that would require non-EU firms to
train AI applications on GDPR compliant data as a condition of market
access in the European Union. Sectors that will likely be impacted by EU
regulation of AI are healthcare, transportation/autos and parts
producers, energy, servic­­­es that rely on consumer data, the public
sector, and more.

To complement the AI white paper, the European Commission released a set
of documents on the regulation of AI, including:

[Communication on a European Strategy for Data, in which the [Commission
outlined]{.mark} the importance of data for economic development and the
decision to invest in High Impact Projects to fund **"[AI
ecosystems"]{.mark}**]{.underline} related to the development of data
spaces and cloud services;

[[Shaping Europe's Digital Future]{.mark}, in which the Commission
itemized all key actions to be undertaken by the European Union in order
[to ease data flow]{.mark}]{.underline} across the Union while enacting
proper regulation to maintain the strength of democratic institutions
and free-market competition, especially in developing sectors such as AI
and cryptocurrency; and

Report on the Safety and Liability Implications of AI, the Internet of
Things and Robotics, in which [[the Commission reviews gaps in product
safety legislation]{.mark} that do not adequately address risks such as
cyberattacks due to connectivity, autonomous behaviors of products,
faulty data, opacity of algorithmic systems, software updates, and
complex safety management and value chains.]{.underline}

Of the four major documents[, [the AI white paper]{.underline}]{.mark}
[has [attracted **the most interest from
stakeholders.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Many are **concerned**
that]{.underline} [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [Commission's regulatory
[vision will be **burdensome, unworkable**, and]{.mark} have the result
of [suppress]{.mark}ing [the success of]{.mark} European digital
[start-ups and the innovation]{.mark} ecosystem in Europe]{.underline}.
Digital rights groups, for their part, have raised alarm over the
Commission's decision to not include a proposal for a three to five-year
moratorium on facial recognition technology in the white paper.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which both face]{.mark} the same [threat of growing **authoritarian
dominance of the internet by China**]{.mark}, [could build a **valuable
strategic partnership** that would support the **scaling of AI
capabilities of** Western economies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Testing and Interoperability are [key concerns]{.underline} for stakeholders

Responding to Commission plans to enact stricter rules for high-risk AI
technologies, such as compliance tests and controls, [[14 EU member
states]{.mark} published a paper outlining their position
[urging]{.mark} the Commission to adopt a ["soft law approach"
consisting of]{.mark} "]{.underline}self-regulation, voluntary labeling
and other voluntary practices, as well as [a [**robust standardization
process** as a supplement]{.mark} to existing legislation that ensures
that essential safety and security standards are met.]{.underline}"1
[[The countries recommend]{.mark} a European approach to AI regulation
in which [innovation and trustworthiness]{.mark} work together [in a
"**coherent and borderless single AI market."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

For several reasons, AI giants such as Google and Facebook, as well as
startups, tech companies, and associations, have raised concerns that
meeting regulatory requirements considered in the AI white paper will
stifle innovation and may require actions that breach EU data privacy
rules.

First, technology corporations are waiting anxiously to see how the
Commission will define "high-risk" AI, as that will have a foundational
impact on how AI regulation is implemented. A chief concern is that the
Commission's definition of "high-risk" AI and its approach to the
concept is too broad and would result in one-size-fits-all regulation
for all AI applications in "high-risk" sectors, regardless of
differences between the sectors and the type of AI application. Instead,
Google, Facebook, and Digital Future for Europe, which represents
associations, tech companies, and startups from the Digital Nine,2
propose a sector, technology, or application-specific regulatory
approach that takes into account unique risks posed by individual
sectors as well as the application itself. For example, risks posed by
AI applications in the healthcare sector are much different than those
in the transportation sector. One-size-fits-all regulation for AI
applications within sectors would also be suboptimal. An AI chatbot
developed for a healthcare company to better understand patient needs
presents a different level and type of risk than an AI application
involved in medical decision-making.

Although expressing agreement with several aspects of the white paper,
IBM, one of the largest technology employers in the European Union,
argues that existing sector-specific governance structures would be
better suited to implement regulation to avoid unnecessarily impeding AI
development. For example, the Commission's propositions on human
oversight requirements may be inappropriately restrictive in the context
of automated driving, since "it is impossible to oversee every single
decision taken by an automated car, due to most decisions being taken in
real time."

[[Stakeholders have]{.mark} [also raised concerns]{.mark} over vague
exceptions included]{.underline} in the white paper that could make it
difficult to determine whether an AI application is subject to
"high-risk" rules. The inclusion of AI applications that could cause
"immaterial damage" as a factor in determining risk was characterized as
nebulous by many stakeholders. The white paper also suggests that there
may be "exceptional circumstances" where an AI application could be
considered "high-risk" regardless of its sector. Booking.com, an online
travel agency headquartered in the Netherlands, has questioned the white
paper's unspecific notion that "applications affecting consumer rights"
could also be required to apply "high-risk" rules. These exceptions and
ambiguities inject an uncertainty into which AI applications will be
considered "high-risk" and increases expectations that the Commission
will adopt an overly broad view of "high-risk" AI applications,
subjecting applications to onerous regulations that are not justified.
In comments to the white paper, the European Digital SME Alliance, a
network of associations representing more than 20,000 European small and
medium ICT enterprises, added, "\[[s[\]mall companies are the first to
suffer from rules that are up to interpretation.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

Digital Future for Europe maintains that the "risk assessment process
would stifle many AI innovations before they have developed," and
through ex-ante regulation "[[the EU threatens to skew the whole
development of European AI]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Additionally, IBM has
cast doubt upon the white paper's proposal of an explicit and exhaustive
list of sectors in which "high-risk" applications could emerge, due to
the rapid evolution of AI technology and its diverse applications.

Second, companies have raised concerns regarding the requirement that AI
developers would need to retrain AI systems in the European Union to
meet data set requirements. Facebook and Google note that [[restricting
data available]{.mark} to train AI to just EU data [is likely to reduce
the quality of the AI product and contribute to biases]{.mark} in the
systems.]{.underline} Digital Future for Europe suggests the Commission
focus on increasing the pool of data acceptable to regulators and
available to AI developers in order to improve AI applications and
encourage innovation. IBM opposes input-specific requirements, arguing
instead that "high-risk" applications should be required to ensure a
specific outcome, such as the absence of discrimination. The
Commission's approach to training data either wrongly assumes AI
applications employ a static data set or raises the prospect that AI
systems would need to be re-audited on a regular basis. That would
drastically slow the ability to update and improve AI tools. This is
particularly concerning if an AI application is producing undesirable or
suboptimal outcomes based on a previously audited data set. Facebook has
pointed out that it is unclear what data needs to be "EU data" and how
the service being provided by an AI application changes that
consideration. Google, as well as the European Association of Automotive
Suppliers (CLEPA), worry that it is difficult to separate out the
provenance of some parts of training datasets in certain fields, which
often rely on third-party and open-source data. Leaving out these data
sets in training could seriously hurt the quality of AI systems
subsequently released in the European Union.

Third, Google and Facebook have raised concerns that compliance with
rules for "high-risk" could run counter to EU privacy rules, including
GDPR. Facebook worries that the proposed requirement to store training
data sets could "create a direct tension" with policies to protect
users' data, such as those related to data minimization and data
retention. The social media platform also worries that the proposed
requirement could prohibit federated learning and other AI approaches
intended to protect privacy.3 In Facebook's view, this requirement could
undermine the potential effectiveness of federated learning in
protecting users' privacy.

Requirements around algorithmic fairness and the need to share source
code also appear to be in tension with EU privacy rules. Google believes
that the requirement to ensure that data sets are "sufficiently
representative" contrasts with GDPR obligations: "developers should not
be able to access attributes such as ethnicity and therefore could not
test for ethic \[sic\] representation in a dataset." Google stresses
that "sufficiently representative" should be more clearly defined.

As an alternative to ex-ante conformity assessments that can be
burdensome, unpredictable, and could expose companies to breaches in
privacy rules, [[Facebook and Google propose benchmark tests]{.mark}
tailored to specific high-risk applications to determine whether or not
AI will behave in a way that is expected. This approach would hold
industry players accountable for mitigating bias in AI, allow internal
testing of AI systems, and support a self-certification
process.]{.underline} Digital Future for Europe suggests an overall
regulatory approach that encourages responsible adoption of AI before
introducing onerous regulation. To do so, [[European governments should
open]{.mark} public [data sets]{.mark}, **[provide for]{.mark} data
[interoperability]{.mark}** [between government]{.mark} data
set[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, refit existing European legislation to
account for AI, [[and make sure that]{.mark} any new [AI]{.mark} rules
[are]{.mark} agile and **[flexible]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Google
proposes a "large central dataset" that developers could access to
protect against developers attempting to overfit models to accord with
EU rules

[Emerging AI Cooperation Efforts]{.underline}

[BENEFITS OF TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION]{.underline}

It will be important for the Commission to recognize that [transatlantic
cooperation can provide Europe with the means necessary to achieve its
AI innovation and adoption goals in several key areas.]{.underline}
First, considering [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the
[Europe]{.mark}an Union [together make up roughly 50 percent of global
GDP and]{.mark} around [770 million people]{.mark},
[establishing]{.mark} agreed-upon [standards for]{.mark} making public
[data sets]{.mark} available can significantly [increase European
businesses' and researchers' **access**]{.mark} **to more
data.**]{.underline} It is important that [this cooperation includes
clarifying where GDPR allows data sets to be shared, an area of
uncertainty that carries many risks for U.S. companies.]{.underline}
Second, reviewing laws that govern copying data sets would increase
clarity about [when a company is permitted to retrain and share
data.]{.underline}

[Third, [collaboration will promote the scaling up of skills and
education]{.mark}, [as]{.mark} both [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} the [Europe]{.mark}an Union [can tap into a **larger pool
of talent, resources, academia, and institutions.**]{.mark} While some
U.S.-EU AI-related research [current]{.mark}ly exists,]{.underline} [the
[projects are relatively "ad hoc and materialize within existing]{.mark}
scientific and technologica[l research]{.mark} [agreements]{.mark} and
roadmaps."]{.underline} For example, the United States remained the
leading non-EU participant in Horizon 2020, the European Union's
six-year research framework to implement and fund high-level EU policy
initiatives, but [[there is **significant room for increased
collaboration**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Right now, U.S. collaborative
links with Horizon 2020 projects are only found in 2 percent of
AI-related projects, 4 percent of machine learning-related projects, and
12 percent of deep learning projects.

AI features "winner-takes-most" dynamics in many industries, with
companies that adopt widespread AI technology are often the quickest to
reap the biggest benefits. The 10 percent of European companies that are
the most extensive users of AI to date are likely to grow three times
faster than the average firm over the next 15 years. MGI observes that
this "winner-takes-most" dynamic applies across many countries.

It will be important for the Commission to recognize [that
[transatlantic cooperation can provide Europe with the means necessary
**to achieve its AI innovation and adoption goals**]{.mark} in several
key areas.]{.underline}

#### Innovation and collaboration are key to stop Chinese challenging of [global democracy]{.underline}\-\--otherwise they take the lead and [steal]{.underline} our innovation

[[The U.S. is the]{.mark} world [leader in
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Its strength in AI has been built on a
global, open, and distributed system of innovation. However, [[this
leadership is being challenged]{.mark} on two main fronts.]{.underline}
[The first is from [China]{.mark}, which [has targeted]{.mark}
development of strong [AI capacity as a]{.mark} strategic and economic
priority and **[source of global power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China
has benefited from]{.mark} global cooperation on AI research and has
expanded **domestic [innovation capacity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [At the
same time, [China combines]{.mark} a restricted [domestic market
with]{.mark} an international approach to AI that includes [**aggressive
acquisition** of]{.mark} intellectual property (IP) and [innovation from
rivals,]{.mark}]{.underline} government subsidies that tilt the playing
field towards Chinese companies, and strategic engagement in
international forums for standards and norms that support China's
applications of AI. [These tactics are often at odds with the interests
of the U.S. and other leading economies, and [the use of AI in]{.mark}
applications like [**repressive surveillance** is at odds with American
values and]{.mark} [those of]{.mark} other
**[democracies.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The second challenge comes from [[other governments]{.mark} whose AI
policies could lead to prescriptive regulation that]{.underline} [[may
stifle AI innovation and discriminate against U.S. tech]{.mark}nology
firms]{.underline}. [Such [policies]{.mark} also [disregard the global
nature of AI]{.mark} development]{.underline}. [[Without international
coordination and integration]{.mark}, [AI]{.mark} policies are [unlikely
to realize their potential]{.mark} [and instead create barriers]{.mark}
to AI diffusion globally.]{.underline}

#### AI cooperation and investment [solidify]{.underline} a democratic digital society and counter Chinese rise\-\--Tech leadership [IS]{.underline} normative leadership

Authoritarians" September 27.

//barn

An essential point here: We do not need new principles. Rather, we need
to reinforce confidence in the continued relevance and applicability of
existing international human rights law framework --- which is globally
recognized and has the status of international law. That said, we do
need to undertake the hard work of articulating how to adhere to our
existing international human rights framework in practice, in a
radically changed digital context. [A global [multistakeholder process
must be initiated]{.mark} [to resolve disagreements among]{.mark}
[democratic actors]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the legitimacy of different
[data practices]{.mark}, platform [regulations, and applications of
AI]{.mark}-enabled tools]{.underline}. Rebuilding the democratic
alliance around a shared understanding of how to adhere to international
human rights law in digital society should be treated as a strategic
priority, on par with cybersecurity and more traditional dimensions of
national security.

Last, but not least, [democracies need to recognize that [**normative
leadership and technological leadership** go
together.]{.mark}]{.underline} If [our goal is [to spread **democratic
values** rather than authoritarian]{.mark} [norms, we must lead in
technological innovation, **particularly in AI**
]{.mark}]{.underline}and quantum computing[.]{.mark}
[[Dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} in those realms [[will translate into
leverage and influence]{.mark} in normative realms [and tech standard
setting bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [we need to become far
more proactive in exporting democratic digital infrastructure as part of
our trade and economic development aid programs, rather than ceding the
opportunity to China to **embed values into digital infrastructure** in
the developing world.]{.underline}

\* \* \*

In sum, domestic practices, international norms, and
[[tech]{.mark}nology [innovation and standards are intertwined with
digital governance systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. The strength of the
digital authoritarian model stems from the fact that these elements are
working in tandem. Democracies must recognize these interdependencies
and demonstrate leadership in all three realms, simultaneously and in a
coordinated fashion.

[The [**tech practice**s]{.mark} we showcase in our domestic context,
the norms for which we advocate in international tech fora, and the
**[investments]{.mark}** we make [in emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [and
democratic information infrastructure will be mutually
reinforcing]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [If this]{.underline}]{.mark}
[complex set of tasks [is embraced and tackled with]{.mark} the **[sense
of urgency]{.mark}** and purpose it deserves, a prosperous, [**secure
democratic future** can be solidified.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[These are
the **essential elements**]{.mark} from [which]{.mark} we can [build a
**democratic digital society.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NATO's AI Influence in Russia--Ukraine Confrontations]{.underline}

[[AI has been]{.mark} a contributing agent in [weaponising cyberspace
and augmenting cyberwarfare]{.mark} to the next level [in **modern
battlefield scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While some of its uses
such as in scaling of data analytics, data fusion, deep fakes, cyber
defence have matured, its use in autonomous weapon systems and other
**complex operational applications are at a nascent
stage**.]{.underline}

[[AI has been aggressively used to **spread disinformation in the
Russia--Ukraine War**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Machine learning algorithms
have been used to amplify misleading and fake content on social media
platforms, like doctored videos of invading forces and fake live
streams. [On the other hand, [it has also been used for **anomaly
detection**, **identification of disinformation** and]{.mark} for
[**cybersecurity.**]{.mark}]{.underline} AI uses natural language
processing algorithms, machine learning and deep learning to identify
anomalies in the text data, images and videos.

[[Russia]{.mark} is said to have [used AI-enabled systems]{.mark} not
only on the battlefield but also [in cyberspace, targeting the
**critical infrastructures of
Ukraine**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}11 [[Russia]{.mark}n troll farms have
been alleged to have [used AI-enabled systems to generate human faces
for fake propagandist personas]{.mark}]{.underline} on social media
platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.12 [[NATO countries
have]{.mark} also **[used AI to help Ukraine counter]{.mark} such
[AI-based attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Private companies are also
playing a role in the unfolding AI battlespace. US-based companies like
Snorkel AI, a data science platform, has made its services accessible to
federal authorities for the detection of anomalous signals and adversary
communications in order to access high-value information for better
decision-making.13

Similarly, Ukraine has been given free access to Clearview AI facial
recognition software, which has a database of 2 billion photos crawled
from Russian social media platforms. This software is being used for the
detection of Russian forces and to identify the dead and gauge the
spread of disinformation in cyberspace.14 AI's analytical potential has
been tapped by companies even before the Russia--Ukraine war started. In
December 2021, a geospatial data firm, SpaceKnow, claimed to have
detected a military presence in Yelna, a Russian town.

[[The Russia--Ukraine conflict has become a **test case for AI adoption
in modern warfare**]{.underline}. [The US]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is
using the conflict as a **test-bed for**]{.mark} **many of its [AI
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} with the Pentagon's 'Maven' project
having contributed to the detection and classification of objects of
interest from various drone footage through AI and Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms. It has been reported that [[the Pentagon has been using
AI]{.mark} and ML tools [to collect a vast amount of data on the
Russia--Ukraine war and analyse it to learn and **generate battlefield
intelligence**]{.mark} about the Russian command and control
strategies]{.underline}.15

[[The advanced AI]{.mark}-enabled [systems with the]{.mark} US
Department of Defense ([DoD)]{.mark} are said to [have been used for
overseeing the battlefield and **collecting and archiving signals
intelligence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It was stated at the Defense One's
Genius AI Summit in April 2022 [that all this **information will be fed
into systems** for training]{.mark} of machine learning algorithms to
support future decision-making processes.]{.underline}16 It is believed
that the US and NATO allies have already built such AI-enabled cyber
weapons and defences, information about which is said to be highly
classified.17

[[The US DoD and its allies have taken advantage]{.mark} of these
advanced tools [to gather **critical information**]{.mark}]{.underline}
from the publically available image data [[to **thwart Russian attacks
in Ukraine**.]{.mark} [This war data will]{.mark} also [help
NATO]{.mark} allies [**anticipate adversary attacks**, their
**behaviour,** and the **use of advanced technologies**]{.mark} in the
real world by countries like China and Russia]{.underline}. [[This
intelligence will also augment multifactor analysis and modelling
changes dynamically]{.mark} by integrating different technological
platforms.]{.underline}

Due to the sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the
Russia--Ukraine war, its AI development is expected to slow down. The
ongoing conflict highlights the constraints around the use of AI.
Despite AI-enabled cyber-attacks and misinformation campaign by Russia,
Ukraine has mounted effective counter-cyber operations.18 Russia's
limited use of AI in the conflict can be explained through the existing
vulnerabilities in the AI systems that can be exploited in many ways.
One hypothesis for Russia's limited use of AI could be the trust in such
systems where it is a matter of lives and military objectives at
stake.19

The vulnerabilities in the AI systems can include data poisoning and
input attacks, attacking the supply pipelines by simply crafting data
and feeding it to public resources, white-box and black-box
attacks.20 [[There is always a **chance of orchestrated and conflicting
data in the face of AI models to derail them**]{.mark} [and to exploit
the vulnerabilities]{.mark} in the algorithms, and active manipulation
by the adversaries can be induced]{.underline}.

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a
Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) programme. Under
this programme, development efforts are being made to establish a
theoretical foundation for defensible ML and the creation and testing of
such systems.21 The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is working with the
Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance
(IoBT-CRA) to explore the use of ML and intelligent technology on the
battlefield and strengthen the collaboration between autonomous actors
and human soldiers in combat. [They are also working on methods to
understand the challenges of AI-enabled systems employed on the
battlefield and to make them less susceptible to attacks]{.underline}.22

[[AI technology in modern warfare will be an intractable weapon in
future conflicts **beyond Ukraine**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Countries
trying to achieve a technological edge over others have started
considerable investments in AI technology to strengthen their
militaries. NATO has invested US\$ 1 billion to develop new AI defence
technologies. The US DoD has also planned to invest US\$ 874 million in
AI-related technologies as a part of their army research and development
budget (federal fiscal year 2022 DoD budget).23 The UK DoD is funding
suppliers to work with Defence Science & Technology Lab (Dstl) on AI
projects which were £7million for the year 2021/22 and is supposed to
increase to £29 million in the next
year.[24](https://www.idsa.in/issuebrief/natos-ai-push-and-military-implications-ssharma-240522#footnote24_sxbrlaa)

[NATO's AI Adoption: Challenges and Limitations]{.underline}

[[The influence of AI on NATO comes with]{.mark} a set of opportunities,
[challenges]{.mark} and risks]{.underline}. [Its adoption process has

geopolitical conflicts and the use of AI]{.mark} in such conflicts have

[[Crises such as Ukraine will become **more acute and risk
prone**]{.mark} **over time** [without investing time and resources into
understanding competition **and escalation**]{.mark} **for the
twenty-first century.**]{.underline} [[Strategy must start with problem
framing and]{.mark} creating a clear description of the ends, ways, and
means within the context of a crisis in a manner that allows for
[clear-eyed assessments of **how to achieve a competitive
advantage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This process starts with reimagining
competition, crises, and escalation in the twenty-first century.

First, the larger national security community needs new models and ways
of thinking about deterrence, competition, and risk. Current defense
planning and academic analytical frameworks are the legacy of Cold War
dynamics that may not match a new era of competition. [Unlike the Cold
War, nuclear-armed [states in a multipolar world will]{.mark} [likely
use]{.mark} nonnuclear weapons (e.g., cruise missiles, space
capabilities, and [**cyber operations**) to produce strategic
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 Beyond capabilities, these studies
should bring the individual back in and assess risk attitudes.

Alongside efforts to think about coercion and cross-domain aspects of
deterrence, the national security community needs more policy-relevant
research that brings individual decisionmaking and attitudes toward risk
back into how it thinks about great power competition.[21 In particular,
[strategic analysis needs more crisis simulations and wargames]{.mark}
designed as survey experiments to capture how both individuals and
groups respond in different scenarios prone to competitive pressure,
fog, and friction]{.underline}.22 These survey experiments enable
researchers to bridge the insights of Carl Von Clausewitz's on war,
Thomas Schelling on deterrence, and Daniel Kahnmann on decisionmaking.
[[These studies should put competition front and center and **integrate
new data and analytic techniques**]{.mark} to understand competitive
dynamics in a connected world.]{.underline}

[For integrated deterrence to be more than a bumper sticker, [the
**D**]{.mark}epartment **[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense [will need
to initiate a new wave of research that evaluates if and how alternating
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}---to include the emergence of Joint
All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)---[[and partner **networks affect
crisis decisionmaking**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[These studies will need
to]{.mark} create alternative scenarios that [reflect whether]{.mark}
promised technological capabilities and **[advances in artificial
intelligence]{.mark}** and machine learning [materialize, as well
as]{.mark} the degree of [partner]{.mark} political interests and
**[interoperability.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In other words, [[the

Information Warfare

[T[he use of technology]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the current conflict
[creates a **daunting scale of impact**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
[[Russia is currently engaging in a **three-front information
offensive**]{.mark} against Ukraine.]{.underline}

**[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation[:]{.mark}]{.underline}** Over the past
decade, Russia has developed and honed the largest and most
comprehensive influence operation in human history. [[These
capabilities]{.mark} [are now used in a targeted, adversarial
approach]{.mark} to reduce the morale of Ukrainian citizens, bolster
Russian sympathizers in the Donbas region, and drum up support for the
campaign amongst Russian citizens]{.underline}. Twitter, Facebook, and
Telegram accounts can be generated automatically or bought by the
thousands as disinformation signal generators.

[**[Cyberwarfare:]{.mark}** [Russia is employing sophisticated
cyberwarfare operations]{.mark} ranging [from]{.mark} [using malware
to]{.mark} **~~cripple~~ \*[incapacitate\* Ukrainian weapon
systems]{.mark}** to [shutting down]{.mark} access to government and
[infrastructure]{.mark} websites.]{.underline} One [cyber probe can scan
an entire network of systems looking for a single unpatched entry
point.]{.underline} Once found, [these [entry points can be exploited
through]{.mark} a massive, growing list of known common vulnerabilities
and exposures (CVEs) and currently unknown **[zero-day
exploits]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

**[[Kinetic warfare]{.mark}:]{.underline}** This past week, Russia has
expanded into kinetic operations, entering the theater with almost 4x
the military assets of Ukraine. [These [kinetic offensives use automated
signal collection and]{.mark} AI-enabled signals intelligence
[(SIGINT)]{.mark} [to guide precision weaponry and]{.mark} specialized
army [units]{.mark} towards high-value targets.]{.underline}

The concurrent use of these three strategies is not a secret. It is
Russia's published playbook.

How [AI can help counter information warfare]{.underline}

[[Responding effectively]{.mark} to the deluge of attacks [is **not
manageable by human analysts**]{.mark} [alone]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Fortunately, [state-of-the-art [AI approaches can exponentially scale
the work]{.mark} of analysts and experts combating adversary
efforts]{.underline}, and deploying these approaches rapidly is more
possible than ever.

[[AI can be used in many ways]{.mark} to respond quickly to the
information warfare operations being waged against Ukraine]{.underline}.
[Examples include[:]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Disinformation:]{.underline}** [[Use]{.mark} natural language
processing [(NLP) to automatically identify disinformation]{.mark}, then
take immediate action by publishing factual responses]{.underline} and
removing adversarial social media accounts.

**[Cybersecurity:]{.underline}** [[Develop anomaly detection]{.mark}
applications to scale analysts' ability to monitor vast networks [and
**rapidly respond** to incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**[Kinetic warfare:]{.underline}** [[Use information extraction to
analyze signals and]{.mark} adversary [communications,]{.mark} identify
high-value information, [and use it to **guide diplomacy and
decision-making.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The war in [Ukraine moved directly into the lab]{.mark} this week,
[with western governments announcing a series of new measures to
coordinate]{.mark} their [military research]{.mark}]{.underline},
including on quantum technologies and hypersonic missiles.

But the shift isn't without controversy, as some European academics
urged the EU to keep its civilian and defence research separate.

[The military build-up took several steps, with [NATO announcing a
coordinated]{.mark}, multi-country [research
programme]{.mark},]{.underline} and the US, Australia and UK setting
plans for expanded quantum, hypersonic and other joint weapons research.
It followed a NATO leaders' meeting last autumn in which the strategy
was set; but the scale and scope of the detailed measures announced this
week were massive.

DIANA launch

Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of NATO, announced this week that
the UK and Estonia will host a joint military R&D programme involving
research centres around the alliance. The Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA) is expected to strengthen transatlantic
cooperation on defence technologies and procurement.

The innovation accelerator will cover projects in artificial
intelligence, big data, quantum technologies, biotechnology, hypersonics
and space. "The goal of DIANA is to support deep technologies companies
that contribute to defence," said Estonian defence minister Kalle
Laanet.

In the UK, Imperial College London will be the host organisation,
coordinating what the UK government called "deep tech test centres" for
military technologies, and a "virtual marketplace" to connect start-ups
with investors and procurers.

[[The project is part of a broader NATO initiative to boost military
research cooperation]{.mark}, that will ultimately involve as many as 60
sites]{.underline}. On 6 April, Denmark's DTU research organisation said
it and partners had been chosen to set up a NATO testing centre in
Copenhagen for quantum technologies. Further announcements on other
sites to be included are expected in coming weeks.

#### Cyber-attacks escalate and trigger Article 5, triggering [all-out]{.underline} war between nuclear states\-\--Sanctions [supercharge]{.underline} uniqueness because counterattacks are the only option left

[[The current political climate presents a **high possibility** for

[[Russia,]{.mark} in line with its aggressive decision to [put its

[[NATO]{.mark} has already [confirmed that]{.mark} a

#### Ukraine risks [international]{.underline} cyber conflict

Dan **Sabbagh 22**, Sabbagh is the Defence and Security editor for the

warns GCHQ chief" May 10.
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/russian-hackers-targeting-opponents-of-ukraine-invasion-warns-gchq-chief>
//barn

[[Russia]{.mark}n hackers are [seeking to target western countries
supporting Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in its efforts to resist
Moscow's invasion, the head of GCHQ has said.

Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech
on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war
between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there
remained "plenty" of cyber activity as part of the conflict.

As well as affecting Ukraine directly, [[there had been "some spillover
of activity affecting other countries]{.mark}"]{.underline}, Fleming
said, [and evidence that [Russian actors were **trying to escalate the
conflict**]{.mark} further afield.]{.underline}

"We've seen indications that [Russia's cyber operatives continue to look
for targets in countries that oppose their actions]{.underline}," the
GCHQ chief said. "That's why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK
businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience."

Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain's
National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its
US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in
producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian
escalation.

At the time they warned there was a risk some [Russian criminal hackers
"have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian
government]{.underline}" [and that they could b[e willing to engage "in
retaliation for perceived **cyber offensives against the Russian
government**]{.mark}]{.underline} or the Russian people".

Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on
Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an
analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media
companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to
disable systems.

Fleming said [the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was
engaged in continuing "to support [Ukraine]{.mark} in shoring up their
cyber defences]{.underline}" -- a recognition that [the country [is the
frontline of what could]{.mark} yet [**spread into an international
cyber conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the
country's power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2
million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. [Although
these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, [there remains the risk
that]{.mark} such **[malware could spread
uncontrolled.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Ukraine is a [flashpoint for]{.underline} US-Russia AI race, risking escalation

Brank leads research on the military and security implication of
emerging technologies. "Beyond Ukraine: AI and the Next US-Russia
Confrontation" February 14.

//barn

[Two titans from the [Cold War era seem set to go another
round]{.mark}]{.underline}, this time over the prospect of Ukraine's
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which the
United States calls a sovereign Ukrainian decision and Russia opposes
vehemently. [Whatever the outcome of the current standoff[, another
confrontation]{.mark} between the United States and Russia [that merits
closer attention is brewing]{.mark} --- one that may fundamentally
reshape the US-Russia security relationship in the not-so-distant
future.]{.underline}

[[Both states]{.mark} are [heavily committed to]{.mark} the use of
artificial intelligence [**(AI) in military systems**]{.mark} and
operations, including logistics, command and control, and intelligence
collection and analysis, as well as to the development of more
autonomous weapons]{.underline}. As tensions rise[, [these countries are
likely to employ capabilities that are **enhanced by AI**]{.mark} and
machine [learning in **cyberattacks and misinformation**]{.mark} and
disinformation campaigns]{.underline}. [[Rising political
temperatures]{.mark} [might well encourage **fast-tracking of more
autonomous military systems**]{.mark} as each side seeks to gain the
advantage.]{.underline}

The United States and Russia have already tested several autonomous
systems. Russia has made important advances on autonomous tanks, while
the United States has demonstrated a number of capabilities, including
swarming munitions, which have the ability to destroy a surface vessel
using a swarm of drones. [At the moment, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is at the forefront]{.mark} of the development of
autonomous systems and military AI applications. [However,]{.mark}
[Russia has approached China to partner]{.mark} with it in building its
AI readiness, and [such]{.mark} a partnership [could be a **game
changer.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

One crucial concern is that the growing autonomy and use of AI in
decision making in existing weapons platforms and in cyberspace will
result in the deployment of immature systems; [[the result could be
accidents that]{.mark} help to **[escalate
conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

At the same time, both Russia and the United States have prevented
progress on new international norms and agreements on the development
and use of autonomous systems that could help to avoid dangerous
situations[. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its allies are
developing norms]{.mark} on responsible military uses of
AI]{.underline}, but little dialogue with potential adversaries has
taken place. And so, the [competition between the great powers is
allowed **to grow unchecked.**]{.underline}

Both Russia and the United States have prevented progress on new
international norms and agreements on the development and use of
autonomous systems that could help to avoid dangerous situations.

Understanding the Role of AI in Contemporary Conflicts

A key challenge is that AI itself is not a weapon but a range of
functions and technologies. As Michael C. Horowitz has noted, AI can be
defined as enabling technology: "AI is not a single widget, unlike a
semiconductor or even a nuclear weapon." In other words, AI is many
technologies and techniques. Such an interpretation helps us to
understand the range of current and potential uses of this technology in
defence applications, including in cyberattacks and digital information
warfare, as well as in more autonomous weapons systems.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} other [NATO members
are]{.mark} already [bolstering Ukrainian cyber
defences]{.mark}]{.underline} in expectation of cyberattacks by Russia
on Ukraine's infrastructure, including its electrical grid,
communication systems and government departments. Yet [[Russia]{.mark}
could [use **AI to overwhelm Ukrainian systems**]{.mark} in conjunction
with misinformation and disinformation campaigns,]{.underline} some of
which might involve manufactured or manipulated images or video, known
as deepfakes.

While cyber and misinformation tactics are not new, AI and machine
learning are offering novel ways to engage in them. And, while Western
media and analysts focus on Russian cyber techniques, it is almost
certainly true that the United States and other NATO members are also
pursuing some of these same tactics against Russia.

[Most states publicly agree that crossing a certain threshold of [cyber
activity]{.mark}, as in the [targeting]{.mark} of [critical
infrastructure]{.mark}, could justifiably be [perceived as]{.mark} akin
to [an **actual physical attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still, [it seems
possible that some [activities short of this threshold]{.mark} are
taking place and [contributing to]{.mark} the **[escalation]{.mark} of
conflict**]{.underline}. UN discussions on responsible behaviour in
cyberspace have sought to build shared norms, but [[more work needs to
be done]{.mark}]{.underline} for concrete rules to be established.

#### Cyber is the [only]{.underline} scenario for escalation\-\--Putin understands conventional attacks in NATO territory are a non-starter, only leaving the scenario of miscalculation and cyber warfare

Nadine **El-bawab 22**, A correspondent for ABC news. "NATO\'s Article 5
could pull the US and its allies further into the Russia-Ukraine
conflict" March 01.
<https://abcnews.go.com/International/natos-article-pull-us-allies-russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83108600>
//barn

[President Joe [Biden]{.mark} repeatedly [has said]{.mark} the United
States will not be sending troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, but vowed
that the U.S. would defend its NATO allies.]{.underline}

\"As I made crystal clear, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will
defend every inch of NATO territory]{.mark} [with the **full force of
American power**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he reiterated in an address
Thursday.

The main goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s founding in
1949 was to foster mutual assistance in response to the Soviet Union\'s
expansion in Europe. A key component of the treaty, Article 5, covers
\"collective defense,\" which means that an attack on one ally is
considered an attack on all allies.

Amid the current crisis, [[Article 5]{.mark} could [mandate a more
direct response from the U.S.]{.mark} and other treaty [members]{.mark}
[if **Russian aggression escalates beyond
Ukraine**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

NATO announced last week it launched its response force, a deployment of
about 40,000 troops to provide land, air and naval assistance across the
alliance. This is the first time the force has been deployed for a
\"deterrence and defence role,\" a NATO spokesperson said.

Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and
professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, told ABC
News [it is possible Article 5 could be invoked while the U.S. and its
allies are providing military aid to Ukraine.]{.underline}

"Let\'s say that Russia succeeds in toppling the government. And it then
tries to occupy and pacify Ukraine. Assuming that the U.S. and its
allies attempt to get arms to a Ukrainian resistance movement, there\'s
a not insignificant risk that Russia might try to interdict that flow.
And that whether by design or by accident, an artillery shell or a
missile or a bomb could land in Poland or another NATO country," Kupchan
said.

"And then we\'re looking at the prospect of an attack on NATO territory
and the potential trigger of the Article Five collective defense
guarantee, which then raises the prospect of potential military conflict
between NATO and Russia," Kupchan said.

All participating countries agree to the form of solidarity outlined in
the article, making it a key component of the alliance. [While
[Ukraine]{.mark} is not a member of NATO, it [borders Poland, Hungry,
Slovakia and Romania, which are members.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Ukraine has been moving toward the West and away from Russia, attempting
to join both NATO and the European Union. Kupchan said its geographical
location could be strategic during this conflict

"In the current moment, Ukraine\'s border with four NATO countries
affords it two important advantages," Kupchan said. "One is refugees are
able to seek asylum in NATO countries, and we\'re seeing hundreds of
thousands of Ukrainians head west. And the other is that now that
Ukraine\'s airspace is ... dominated by Russia, the long border between
Ukraine and NATO affords an opportunity to continue to funnel weapons
and other sources of support to Ukraine.\"

The first time Article 5 was invoked was after the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11, 2001. The alliance had already identified terrorism as a risk
affecting its security in 1999. In response to the attack, NATO engaged
in the fight against terrorism, launching its first operations outside
the Euro-Atlantic area to patrol the skies over the U.S.

In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door for Ukraine\'s membership saying
it would become a member of the alliance, despite a lack of consensus
between members, Kupchan said. NATO did not specify a pathway or
timeframe for Ukraine to join the alliance.

"In 2008, the Bush administration wanted to proceed with what\'s called
a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and Georgia. And European partners
were reluctant, in part because neither Ukraine nor Georgia was ready to
join NATO and because of concern that NATO\'s enlargement to Georgia and
Ukraine would be seen as provocative in Russia," Kupchan said.

"Given the lack of consensus within NATO, the alliance agreed to issue a
generic statement that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members,
but didn't specify a timeframe or a pathway," Kupchan said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the current crisis to Russia\'s
NATO demands, including a guarantee that NATO will stop expanding to the
East, in a video address days before Russia invaded Ukraine. Putin
accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring his demands and blamed the West
for the Ukraine crisis.

\"\[Putin\] has said explicitly that he wants to see NATO\'s military
presence \[reduced\] in the eastern flank and that would include the
three Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, \" Kupchan
said. \"He wants to see NATO pull its capability back.\"

\"One of the tragic dimensions of this conflict is that the Russians
knew full well, that Ukrainian membership in NATO was not under
consideration. It was not on the table. And NATO governments were quite
explicit about that. Nonetheless, Putin decided to invade the country,\"
Kupchan said.

[[Its unlikely Putin would launch an attack on a NATO ally]{.mark}
because he would be looking at a \"full-scale war,\" he
said.]{.underline}

\"My guess is that [[he understands that this is a
non-starter]{.mark},]{.underline}\" Kupchan said.

## AT: Centralization Bad

### Centralization Good

#### AI centralization improves administration in government programs and protects national security

http://www.floridalawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Rubenstein_BOOK.pdf//RA

Ideally[, [AI can make government more]{.mark} [efficient]{.mark} and
effective [across a]{.mark} wide [range of functions]{.mark}: law
enforcement, [adjudication]{.mark}, rulemaking, **[national
security]{.mark}**, resource allocation, in-house management, delivery
of public services, [and beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}.115 Moreover, with
proper design, AI systems can provide greater accuracy than human
deciders alone.116 Further, AI systems may be more transparent and
accountable than government agents, who might conceal or be unaware of
their own cognitive biases.117

[**[The centralization of AI decision-making may]{.underline}** **[also
promote greater consistency across cases]{.underline}**]{.mark}, both in
public-facing operations (such as adjudication and law enforcement) and
inward-facing operations (such as personnel retention).118 What's more,
**[[centralized AI decision-making can facilitate audits of]{.mark}
external and internal government [programs]{.mark}]{.underline}**.119

The government's adoption of AI technologies may also be fiscally
responsible. By "automating repetitive tasks" and "augmenting" the
capabilities of federal workers, taxpayer dollars can be saved or
rerouted to better use.120 According to one rosy estimate, the
government's widespread adoption of AI could yield \$500 billion in cost
reductions over the next decade.121

Suffice to say, [AI has the potential to augment, enable, and vastly
improve government operations]{.underline}. Beyond better, however, the
government's rapid uptake of AI is arguably imperative "to protect \[the
nation's\] security, promote its prosperity, and safeguard the future of
democracy."122 That was a top-line message delivered by the National
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) to the President
and Congress in 2021.123

While this Article is principally focused on civilian and domestic
contexts, the global "AI arms race" is quite relevant here. Foremost,
[the global competition exerts gravitational pull on the government's
entire AI trajectory]{.underline}. 124 More concretely, [the race
anchors the government's ambition to "retain \[America's\] innovation
leadership"]{.underline}125---which depends mightily on the industry's
capacities and cooperation. Further, **[[the U.S./China
juxtaposition---and narratives around it---crystallize the need for AI
innovation and ideation that reflects American
values]{.underline}]{.mark}**.126 As put by the NSCAI: If AI systems
violate civil rights, or "have significant negative consequences, then
leaders will not adopt them, operators will not use them, Congress will
not fund them, and the American people will not support them."127

The JAIC lacks visibility. The issue of visibility is subtle. [The JAIC
has been designated]{.underline}, in the summary of the DoD AI strategy,
[as the focal point for carrying out DoD's strategy]{.underline}, and is
expected to attract and cultivate a world-class AI team. This
designation and role presume a certain degree of visibility both within
DoD and outside it. This visibility was lacking based on our interviews.
Overall, [we noted a lack of clarity among our interviewees
on]{.underline} the JAIC's [mandate, roles, and activities]{.underline}.
We also noted a lack of clarity around how it fits within the broader
DoD ecosystem and how it connects to the services and their efforts.
That was true of both DoD interviewees and our industry interviewees who
had heard of the JAIC (see section "Organization: At the OSD Level" in
Appendix B and section "Thoughts Across Industry: On the JAIC" in
Appendix C). In addition to the lack of clarity about the JAIC's current
mandate and roles, there were many perspectives about the desired or
ideal role for the JAIC as DoD embraces and scales AI. These
perspectives ranged from the JAIC as a central repository of information
and best practices, to the JAIC as a center of excellence that focuses
on discrete tasks (e.g., building the JCF, formalizing standards for
VVT&E), to the JAIC's potential elevation to a field agency or other
entity with a direct reporting line to either the Secretary or DSD.

We do not believe this lack of clarity to be simply a question of
messaging. More fundamentally, it points to a lack of clarity about the
raison d'être of the JAIC and how the specific roles it has been
assigned support that. The confusion might not be entirely on the part
of the audience. [[DoD needs to have a clearer view of what it

the success of JAIC's mission, and therefore DoD's vision.

The DIB's Technologies and Capabilities Recommendation  5, cited earlier
in this chapter, proposed establishing a centralized, focused, and
well-resourced organization to propel applied research in AI and ML

us to believe [there is]{.mark}]{.underline}** indeed **[[value]{.mark}

would have a mandate that goes beyond applied research and would be

institute organizational change and scale AI across DoD.]{.underline}
One of our industry interviewees noted that **[[centralization at onset

**[[premature]{.mark} [decentralization of effort]{.mark} likely [would

Based on the premises that (1) the JAIC is the focal point of DoD AI
activity; (2) it fulfills the need for a centralized, well-resourced
organization to scale AI and its impact across DoD (see above); (3) it

#### **Only centralization and decentralization in accordance with each other solve -- the perm solves best**

Matthew R. **Voke 19**, Matthew R. Voke is a major at USAF, "Artificial
Intelligence for Command and Control of Air Power," Air Command and
Staff College, June 2019,

US doctrine prescribes the conduct of joint air operations using the
principle of centralized control and decentralized execution.22 An
oversimplified synopsis driving this tenet of airpower is that
**[[centralization of control enables]{.underline}]{.mark}** the 5
senior **[echelon [commanders to control, mass, and lead forces
effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[[decentralization]{.mark} of
execution allows [forces to seize the initiative]{.mark}, respond to
uncertain and changing environments, [and fosters flexibility in lower
echelons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Technological developments frequently shift the equilibrium of this
tenet of airpower. Robust [communications connectivity]{.underline} has
[increased the shared operations picture at all levels, but it has also
enabled senior leadership involvement in the finest details of
employment]{.underline}.23 This duality has created inherent tension
between the imperatives of political control and those of efficient
mission accomplishment that leaders must understand.24 Although
centralized control and execution are possible in many situations, a
conscious effort to delegate execution authority appropriately will
ensure the maintenance of US airpower agility.

**[[The]{.mark} [balance]{.mark} of centralization and decentralization
[can shift between and during conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and
leaders must strive to increase what some call "agility"]{.underline} in
airpower employment. The Air Force Future Operating Concept defines
agility as the ability to react rapidly to situations. Agility is a
combination of one's flexibility, speed, coordination, balance, and
strength.25 [[Decentralization]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[favors
flexibility and speed]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[while]{.mark}
[centralization]{.mark} [generally favors coordination and
strength]{.mark}]{.underline}. One's understanding of agility might
imply physical capability, but agility also includes a cognitive
capability to react to a dynamic opponent, moving target, or shifting
environment.26 The power of AI employment in airpower C2 lies in the
cognitive speed and strength it can bring synergistically toward the
goal of agility.

accessed 6-28-2022//cpd (EDITED FOR ABELIST LANGUGE)

[Is NATO ~~brain-dead~~ \[OBSOLOTE\] or back in business?]{.underline}
Less than [three years ago,]{.underline} French President Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline} famously [diagnosed "the ~~brain death~~ of
NATO."]{.underline} Rhetoric aside, [his point was fair at the time:
Europe's dearth of strategic thinking combined with the unpredictability
of U.S. policy under then-President Donald Trump spelled serious trouble
for the Cold War-era alliance.]{.underline}

[Now, all talk is of NATO's revival and resurgence]{.underline}.
[**Russia's war on Ukraine has given an urgent new relevance to the
bloc's core mission of territorial defense.** NATO members appear to
have found a new unity of purpose, supplying Ukraine with weapons,
reassessing the threat from Russia, hiking defense budgets, and
bolstering the security of the alliance's eastern frontier.]{.underline}
But the "honeymoon," in the words of Lithuanian Foreign Minister
Gabrielius Landsbergis, was brief. [As the war drags on, strains are
showing, and **the alliance is still shaky.**]{.underline}

It's true that NATO has come a long way. Only 14 years ago, the
alliance's top-secret threat assessment body, MC 161, was explicitly
prohibited by its political masters from even considering any military
danger from Russia in its scenarios. The pressure came not only from
notorious Russia-huggers such as Germany but also from the United
States, which was eager to keep east-west ties friendly. The Kremlin,
the conventional wisdom insisted, was a partner, not an enemy. As a
result, NATO's most vulnerable members---Poland and the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---remained second-class allies. They were
in the bloc, but only on paper. There were no significant outside forces
on their territory, and the alliance expressly refrained from making
contingency plans to reinforce or even defend them in the event of
attack. Poland demanded such plans and was told that they could be drawn
up to defend the country against an attack by Belarus---but not by
Russia.

[Since Russia's first attack on Ukraine in 2014, NATO plans and
deployments have become more serious.]{.underline} There are
1,000-strong tripwire forces in the three Baltic states and a larger
U.S. force in Poland. Since the start of the invasion in February, that
presence has increased sharply. [Moreover, two of the most advanced
smaller military powers in Europe, Finland and Sweden, are banging on
the alliance's door.]{.underline} Assuming objections from Turkey can
been smoothed out, they will be members by year's end. [That will
fundamentally change the military geography of northeastern
Europe.]{.underline}

[Still more important is the stiffening of spines among the
members.]{.underline} Trump's much publicized distaste for NATO was
based, in part, on the European members' chronic underspending. At one
point, the exasperated U.S. leader even tried to present a bill to his
German counterpart, Chancellor Angela Merkel. Now, defense spending is
rising across the alliance. [That makes NATO an easier sell in
Washington, especially as the case for U.S. engagement in European
security is bolstered by the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}

Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while makronic in Polish
(and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as "vacuous
grandstanding while doing nothing."

Germany, the most notorious laggard, is suddenly splurging money on its
decrepit armed forces---tanks that can't trundle, ships that can't go to
sea, and soldiers who exercise with broomsticks instead of guns. [It has
agreed to meet NATO's defense spending benchmark of 2 percent of GDP,
set in 2006 and largely ignored thereafter.]{.underline} The latest
country to announce a big hike in defense spending is Spain, currently
lagging at barely 1 percent of GDP. The prime minister announced that
this will double by 2024. T[hat sets the scene nicely for the NATO
summit in the Spanish capital later this month.]{.underline}

**[Yet look a little more closely,]{.underline}** and the picture is far
less rosy. Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since the start
of Russia's war, **[NATO looks out of shape and out of
date.]{.underline}** In the run-up to their summit, [the allies have
been furiously haggling over the language in their new strategic
concept]{.underline}, which will frame the alliance's mission for the
coming years and will be unveiled in Madrid. [What will it say about
Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the member states
really willing to accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in order
to streamline decision-making?]{.underline}

Nothing in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get clear
answers. [For starters, the 30-strong alliance is unwieldy]{.underline}.
In military terms, only a handful of members matter---above all, the
United States---but in political terms, even little Luxembourg and
Iceland get a voice. Worse, **[the political divides are
huge.]{.underline}** Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a
semi-authoritarian state that flirts with Russia and fumes at what it
considers European meddling over human rights. Hungary under Prime
Minister Viktor Orban is taking a different but downward path, fusing
wealth and power into a new system of control at home and [undermining
U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on Russia and
China.]{.underline} Macron's relentless posturing and German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz's foot-dragging create constant obstacles and distractions.
[The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious display since the start of the
war, have already enriched the language]{.underline}: Scholzen is a
German neologism for "dither," while makronic in Polish (and its
equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as "vacuous
grandstanding while doing nothing."

Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a big question mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.
[Any threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed. More likely it will be something deliberately
ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the
territory of a front-line state and hits a target]{.underline}. [Some
countries would favor a tough response. Others would fear escalation and
want dialogue]{.underline}. [Still others would take the ambiguity as a
convenient excuse to do nothing]{.underline}. Would the 30---soon to be
32---national representatives in the North Atlantic Council, the
alliance's deliberative body, really make a speedy and tough decision on
how to react? More likely, [some of them would plead for delay,
diplomacy, and compromise.]{.underline} Those actually facing the
possibility of attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp
military confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one
inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic
states, speaking anonymously, told me. "[We have seen what they did in
Ukraine]{.underline}."

**[The political weaknesses are matched by military ones.]{.underline}**
[By far the most important country in the alliance is the United States.
The U.S. security guarantee to Europe]{.underline}---with its threat of
devastating conventional and, if necessary, nuclear response to any
attack---is the cornerstone of the alliance. "All for one and one for
all" sounds fine, but nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought
of Spanish, Dutch, or Canadian displeasure. Yet [the result of this is a
colossal dependence on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and
spare parts]{.underline} (of which European countries' stockpiles are
notoriously skinny) to military transports that move forces quickly and
efficiently over long distances. Even if Europe's new defense spending
plans materialize, they will not change the fact [that only U.S. armed
forces can move with the scale and speed necessary to defend territory
from a country like Russia.]{.underline}

[Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden themselves. They
need advanced weapons, particularly for air and missile defense, that
they cannot afford themselves]{.underline}. The thin neck of land along
the Polish-Lithuanian border, the so-called Suwalki Gap, is particularly
vulnerable to attack from Russia's militarized Kaliningrad exclave and
Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania both
want a big U.S. military presence---either a permanent base or a
persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this strategic chokepoint.

**[Yet NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the United States and Europe.]{.underline}**
[They rely on the fiction that the European allies are more or less
equal partners.]{.underline} Even military lightweights need to have
important-sounding jobs and installations, making the North Atlantic
Council the military version of a parliament dividing out the pork.

**[The resulting command structure is like a tangled pile of
spaghetti.]{.underline}** In the Baltic region alone, NATO has several
multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarters split between
Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland, and a
corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

#### The is confronting the Greek-Turkish conflict now, but exclusion of Turkey in NATO operations risks sending the wrong signal

Seth **Cropsey**, **6-23**-2022, \"Diversionary war: Turkey's actions
against Greece are a growing threat to NATO,\" Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3534155-diversionary-war-turkeys-actions-against-greece-are-a-growing-threat-to-nato/,

[Turkish obstructionism against Swedish and Finnish NATO membership, its
limited offensive in Iraq, and its prospective offensive in Syria have
grabbed international attention. But **more significant is Turkey's
growing diplomatic tension with Greece,** an ever-festering lesion that
threatens to burst.]{.underline}

[Considering Turkey's domestic situation and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, the United States must be wary.]{.underline} Turkish President
Recip Tayyip Erdogan could capitalize on international distraction and
wage a diversionary war to boost his popularity, a conflict that would
disrupt NATO's cohesion and threaten the alliance.

**[Washington should act now to resolve the current incarnation of this
long-standing Mediterranean dispute.]{.underline}**

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics since 2001, when his
AKP party first won a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Although
Erdogan was banned from Turkish politics for anti-secular incitement,
his prime ministerial --- and, later, presidential --- predecessor,
Abdullah Gül, until the mid-2010s at least, was functionally a stand-in
for him. Erdogan may have restricted his Islamist proclivities and
international assertiveness until he consolidated power in 2014-2016.
However, [Turkey's break with the United States over the latter's
invasion of Iraq, and Turkey's growing hostility towards Israel,
indicated a deeper rift between Washington and Ankara.]{.underline}
Erdogan consistently sought a greater regional role; through diplomatic
pressure against Israel culminating with the Gaza Flotilla --- a
bald-faced attempt to prompt a confrontation with Israel --- Erdogan
hoped to position himself as the spiritual leader of the Islamic world.

The Arab Spring, however, transformed the regional balance. No power
could pretend that the "Palestine Question" still defined regional
politics. The Libyan and Syrian civil wars, and the subsequent rise of
ISIS, thrust Islamism to the fore once again, while Iranian expansion in
Iraq, Syria and Lebanon demonstrated the relevance of traditional
coalition competition, rather than religious rivalry.

[Turkey's response has been to sharpen its shift away from the United
States]{.underline} by alternating between Russophilic and Russophobic
policies.

The Levantine maelstrom that began in Syria and exploded in Iraq stoked
Turkish fears of Kurdish revanchism. Even before that, Russian presence
in Syria prompted Turkey to pursue a more aggressive policy, supporting
Islamist elements in the Syrian opposition and destroying a Russian
Su-24 that briefly violated Turkish airspace. Two years later, Turkey
agreed to purchase S-400 anti-air systems from Russia that, in 2019,
prompted its ejection from the West's F-35 fighter-jet program and U.S.
sanctions.

More generally, Turkey asserted itself militarily since 2016,
intervening directly in Syria and Libya. In the latter conflict, Turkey
aligned with the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, opposing
the Tobruk-based French-, Russian-, Emirati- and Egyptian-supported
House of Representatives. Although fighting there has subsided, tensions
may again explode --- and by striking a territorial deal in Libya,
Turkey can lay claims to the Eastern Mediterranean's natural gas
deposits, threatening Israel, Egypt and Greece.

[Turkish actions during the Ukraine war have indicated Ankara's desire
to return to the Western fold.]{.underline} Initially, Turkey refrained
from engaging, likely seeking to determine if Ukraine would collapse
within days. However, three days into the war, when it became apparent
Ukraine would resist, [Turkey closed the Bosphorus Straits to Russia;
Russian Black Sea Fleet warships in the Levantine Basin can still return
to their home port in Sevastopol, but their inability to sortie from
Sevastopol into the Mediterranean will disrupt Russian outer naval
defenses in the long-term.]{.underline}

[Turkey also attempted to position itself as a mediator between Kyiv and
Moscow, and it spearheaded a half-hearted attempt]{.underline} (albeit
with great public fanfare) to ensure grain exports from Ukraine.

Yet, [Turkey's resistance to Swedish and Finnish NATO memberships is a
ploy to extract concessions from Washington:]{.underline} If the Biden
administration reinstates Turkey in the F-35 program and approves F-16
sales, Erdogan likely will relent.

Buying Turkish acquiescence is no way to ensure a long-term strategic
partnership, however. Indeed, [Erdogan is laying the groundwork for
another Greco-Turkish confrontation.]{.underline}

The focal point, once again, is Cyprus. Greece and Cyprus are linked by
ethno-linguistic ties, political history and strategic interest. If
Crete "caps" the Aegean, [Cyprus provides Greece a pressure point
against any Anatolian or Near Eastern power that would threaten
it]{.underline}. Greece maintains a small military force in Cyprus, is a
supplier to Cyprus' small National Guard, and is a crucial Cypriot
trading partner. However, in 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus, capturing a
third of the island and collapsing the Greek military junta that had
organized a coup in Cyprus earlier that year. Turkey has not annexed
Cyprus outright, instead establishing a satellite state on the island's
north that only Ankara recognizes. [The current situation is tenable,
although Turkey has used Northern Cyprus to tacitly extend its presence
in the Levantine Basin.]{.underline}

Turkey's agreement with Libya solidified its claims to the Eastern
Mediterranean's petrochemicals. With the Libyan civil war's apparent
conclusion, and Turkey's desire to return to the Western camp, Erdogan
might be expected to refrain from spoiling Greco-Turkish relations with
moves in Cyprus or elsewhere --- but he has done the opposite. Turkey
has struck a major economic deal with Northern Cyprus that would
increase Ankara's direct leverage over the statelet; it would list Ercan
airport, Northern Cyprus's international aerial hub, as a domestic
destination on Turkish flights. Cypriot authorities fear this is the
first step towards outright annexation, which would shatter a
UN-brokered ceasefire and undoubtedly prompt a Greek military response.
Erdogan has also leveled threats over Greece's alleged militarization of
Aegean islands, despite Greece's long-standing military presence in the
Aegean.

In turn, an escalating economic crisis is ravaging Turkey. Food and
energy supply disruptions have sharpened inflationary pressures with
which Turkey has grappled since 2017. Erdogan's refusal to increase
interest rates and tighten the money supply is an advanced form of
macro-economic foolishness; in 2021, the Turkish lira's value

was slashed by half. Yet inflation remains at 60-plus percent and is
likely to climb.

Erdogan's AKP lost ground in nearly all major cities in the 2019 local
elections. As the 2023 parliamentary and presidential elections
approach, Erdogan may seek to distract domestic attention with a major
foreign policy crisis, such as a confrontation with Greece.

**[The United States should ensure that this crisis does not stress
NATO.]{.underline}** [Russia will employ every tool at its disposal to
force a confrontation between Greece and Turkey, including hybrid
provocations, diplomatic overtures, naval exercises and perhaps even
false flags.]{.underline}

[Preventing a crisis requires three steps, one military, two
diplomatic.]{.underline}

First, the United States ought to increase its naval presence in the
Eastern Mediterranean. Ideally, it would sustain a consistent carrier
deployment to the Levantine Basin, as it did during the Cold War and has
done since Russian designs against Ukraine neared their boiling point.
The very presence of a U.S. carrier, with the combat power it provides,
may be sufficient to deter Turkish escalation and demonstrate to Ankara
that a diversionary crisis will only trigger more stresses for Erdogan's
regime. Second, the United States should convene a series of bilateral
Turkish-Greek summits, similar to the "shuttle diplomacy" it practiced
in the 1970s between Israel and its Arab adversaries, to coordinate
policy with Northern Cyprus and the Cypriot Republic. At minimum,
pinning Turkey in substantive dialogue will slow an escalation cycle. At
best, the U.S., through skillful balancing, can address Turkish
diplomatic demands and settle issues more generally. The next financial
hammer to fall: Public pension funds Victory in Ukraine could mean a
stalemate Third, the United States should prioritize reintegrating
Turkey into NATO. This should involve both the sale of F-35s and F-16s
with the caveat that Turkey must support U.S. activity in the Black Sea.
Turkey should receive a reward for good behavior. But it should also
offer something in return --- for example, decreasing tensions on Cyprus
or allowing Western ships to enter the Black Sea to clear Russian mines
and escort merchant ships carrying Ukrainian grain to global ports.

[As the Ukraine War drags on, the greatest threat to Western objectives
will not be Russian military capabilities but divisions within NATO. A
Greco-Turkish confrontation would threaten to upend the Atlantic
Alliance at precisely the wrong time. **It must be
prevented.**]{.underline}

#### Black Sea DA- Turkey inclusion on NATO relations is key to future engagements in the Black Sea

Worth Saving,\" Rachel Ellehuus is deputy director and senior fellow
with the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, D.C.,

accessed 6-25-2022//cpd

Yet these foundational factors remain valid: **[Turkey's geopolitical
position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa still provides
NATO with needed political and operational reach,]{.underline}** [and
Turkey continues to benefit from the collective military power of
NATO.]{.underline} With the relationship close to (if not at) its nadir,
Turkey and NATO, with the support of the EU, need to take active
measures to anchor it for the future, while avoiding steps that could
destroy the relationship entirely.

Active measures

Assuming that Turkey is in fact interested in rebuilding the
relationship with its NATO allies, [there are several active measures
NATO and Turkey can take now to create a foothold for the future. The
key is to focus on areas of mutual interest where NATO involvement is
critical to Turkish strategic interests and where **Turkey has a unique
role to play in NATO.**]{.underline}

The first of these is the Black Sea, where Turkey, as well as fellow
NATO Black Sea littoral states Romania and Bulgaria, are trying to
balance an increasing Russian military presence. [While previously
resistant to a greater NATO role in the Black Sea for fear it would
dilute its own influence in the region, Turkey now sees the dangers of
leaving Russian influence and presence in Black Sea
unchecked.]{.underline} With its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014
and entry into the Syrian civil war in 2015, [Russia has significantly
increased its presence and combat capabilities in both the Black Sea and
Eastern Mediterranean.]{.underline}

[NATO now faces an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble that restricts
allies' freedom of maneuver in the Black Sea, with Russia capable of
attacking from both land and sea.]{.underline} [To effectively counter
this, NATO should establish a more continuous presence in the Black
Sea]{.underline}, [revive the idea of a permanent NATO maritime fleet in
the Black Sea, and consider basing more counter-A2/AD capabilities in
Turkey and Romania.]{.underline} Importantly, **[Turkey holds unique
power to control access to the Black Sea]{.underline}** thanks to the
1936 Montreux Convention, which governs naval passage through the
Turkish Straits, limiting the number of foreign vessels that can enter
the Black Sea via the Straits and how long these vessels can stay. [This
access is important to both Russia and NATO. Whereas Turkey has proven
to be an impartial and reliable enforcer of the treaty, Russia has
pushed the boundaries of Montreux repeatedly since the Russo-Georgian
War in 2008 and, more recently, impeded the course of NATO vessels that
have entered and departed the Black Sea in compliance with the
treaty.]{.underline} More behavior along these lines, or a [Russian
attempt to leverage its new, closer relationship with Turkey to secure
more favorable access to the Black Sea, would likely **increase Turkey's
unease and lead it to rely more on NATO as a
counterbalance.**]{.underline}
