#### Queer life is prestructured by chrononormativity -- temporal linearity organizes life into staged sequences of maximum productivity in service of capital and statecraft. To have a life, to embody one's flesh, is to belong to the state's timeline of linear movement that brackets out the "excessive" and "unproductive" past unless it contributes to national futurity. Debate itself is structured by this temporal linearity -- the resolutional demand for action is the generative point for zones of excess violence. Out of the narratives of chronobiopolitics emerges the sexual dissident of queerness, the anachronism, the flicker of history and pastness, that interrupts the sequence of cisheteronormativity and must immediately be effaced.

By portraying the reciprocal derangement of bodies and sequences, K.I.
P. offers a through-the-looking-glass view of how time binds a socius.
By ''binds,'' I mean to invoke the way that **[human energy is collated
so that it can sustain itself.]{.underline}** By **[''time
binds,'']{.underline}** I mean something beyond the obvious point that
people find themselves with less time than they need. Instead, I mean
that **[naked [flesh is bound into socially meaningful em- bodiment
through temporal regulation: binding]{.mark} is what [turns]{.mark} mere
[exis- tence into a form of mastery]{.mark} in a process I'll refer to
as [chrononormativity]{.mark}, or [the use of time to organize
individual human bodies toward maximum
productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And I mean that **[[people are
bound]{.mark} to one another, en- grouped, made to feel coherently
collective, [through particular orchestra- tions of
time]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Dana Luciano has termed this
**[[chronobiopolitics]{.mark}, or [''the sexual arrangement of the time
of life'' of entire populations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Chrononormativity is a mode of implantation]{.mark}, a technique by
which [institutional forces come to seem like somatic facts]{.mark}.
Schedules, calendars, time zones, and even wristwatches
inculcate]{.underline}** what the sociologist Evitar Zerubavel calls
**[[''hidden rhythms,'']{.mark} forms of temporal experience that [seem
natural to those whom they privilege.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[Manipulations of time con- vert historically specific regimes of
asymmetrical power into seemingly ordinary bodily tempos and routines,
which in turn organize the value and meaning of time.]{.mark} The advent
of wage work]{.underline}**, for example, **[entailed a violent
retemporalization of bodies once tuned to the seasonal rhythms of
agricultural labor]{.underline}**. An even broader description of
**[chrononormativity]{.underline}** appears in Pierre Bourdieu's
discussion of habitus---**[a social group's culti-vated set of gestural
and attitudinal dispositions.]{.underline}** Bourdieu argues that ''the
durably installed generative principle of regulated improvisations''
structuring the norms of embodiment, personhood, and activity in a
culture takes shape within the rhythms of gift exchange. For Bourdieu,
cultural competence and thus belonging itself are matters of timing, of
coming to inhabit a culture's expectations about the temporal lapses be-
tween getting and giving such that they seem inborn. More recently,
Judith Butler has shown **[how the rhythms of gendered performance---
specifically, repetitions---accrete to "freeze" masculinity and
femininity into timeless truths of being.]{.underline}** Zerubavel's
"hidden rhythms," Bourdieu's "habitus," and Butler's "gender
performativity" all describe how **[repe- tition engenders identity,
situating the body's supposed truth in what Nietzsche calls ''monumental
time,'' or static existence outside of histori- cal
movement]{.underline}**. But Bourdieu alone allows us to see that
**[subjectivity emerges in part through mastering the cultural norms of
withholding, delay, surprise, pause, and knowing when to stop---through
mastery over [certain forms of time]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
**[temporal manipulations]{.underline}** that **[go beyond pure
repetition]{.underline}**, his work suggests, **[[institutionally and
culturally enforced rhythms]{.mark}, or timings, [shape flesh into
legible, acceptable embodiment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[In
chronobiopolitics, [this process]{.mark} extends beyond individual
anato- mies to [encompass the management of entire populations:]{.mark}
people whose individual bodies are synchronized not only with one
another but also with larger temporal schemae experience belonging
itself as natural. In a chronobiological society, [the state and
other]{.mark} institutions, including [repre- sentational apparatuses,
link properly temporalized bodies to narratives of movement and
change.]{.mark} These are teleological schemes of events or strate- gies
for living [such as marriage, accumulation of health and wealth for the
future, reproduction, childrearing, and death and its attendant
ritual]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. Indeed, as the anthropologist John
Borneman's work clarifies, **[so-called [personal histories become
legible only within a state-sponsored time- line]{.mark}. his timeline
tends to [serve a nation's economic interest]{.mark}s]{.underline}**,
too. In the United States, for instance, states now license, register,
or certify birth (and thus citizenship, eventually encrypted in a Social
Security id for taxpaying purposes), marriage or domestic partnership
(which privatizes caretaking and regulates the distribution of
privatized property), and death (which terminates the identities linked
to state benefits, redistribut- ing these benefits through familial
channels), along with sundry privileges like driving (to jobs and
commercial venues) and serving in the military (thus incurring state
expenditures that often serve corporate interests). **[In the eyes of
the state, [this sequence of socioeconomically ''productive'' moments is
what it means to have a life]{.mark} at all. And [in zones not]{.mark}
fully [reducible to the state]{.mark}]{.underline}**---in, say,
psychiatry, medicine, and law---**[[having a life entails the ability to
narrate it]{.mark} not only [in these state-sanctioned terms]{.mark} but
also in a novelistic framework: as [event-centered, goal-oriented, in-
tentional, and culminating in]{.mark} epiphanies or major
[transformation.]{.mark} The logic of [time-as-productive]{.mark}
thereby becomes one of serial cause-and- effect: [the past seems useless
unless it predicts and becomes material for a future.]{.mark} These
teleologies of living, in turn, structure the logic of a "peo- ple's"
inheritance: rather than just the transfer of private property along
heteroreproductive lines, inheritance becomes the familial and
collective legacy from which a group will draw a properly political
future]{.underline}**---be it national, ethnic, or something else.
**[Chronobiopolitics harnesses not only sequence but also [cycle, the
dia- lectical companion to sequence]{.mark}, for [the idea of time as
cyclical stabilizes its forward movement, promising renewal rather than
rupture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And as Julia Kristeva argues, **[[the
gender binary organizes]{.mark} the meaning of this and other [times
conceived as outside of---but symbiotic with---linear
time]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Kristeva claims that **[[Woman, as a
cultural symbol]{.mark}, comes to be [correlated with the endless
returns of cyclical time]{.mark},]{.underline}** as well as the stasis
of monu- mental time: **[the figure of Woman supplements the
historically specific nation-state with appeals to nature and
eternity.]{.underline}** Luciano dates a par- ticularly Anglo-American
version of this arrangement to the early nine- teenth century, when
''**[separate spheres'' were above all temporal: the repetitions and
routines of domestic life supposedly restored working men to their
status as human beings responding to a ''natural'' environ- ment,
renewing their bodies for reentry into the time of mechanized production
and collective national destiny]{.underline}**. In the wake of
industrializa- tion in the United States, she writes, **[mourning was
newly reconcep- tualized as an experience outside of ordinary time, as
eternal, recurrent, even sacred]{.underline}**---and so, I would argue,
were any number of other affective modes. Mid-nineteenth-century writers
figured maternal love, domestic bliss, romantic attachments, and
eventually even bachelorhood as havens from a heartless world and, more
importantly, as sensations that moved according to their own beat.
**[The emerging discourse of domesticity, especially, inculcated and
validated a set of feelings---love, security, har- mony, peace, romance,
sexual satisfaction, motherly instincts---in part by figuring them as
timeless, as primal, as a human condition located in and emanating from
the psyche's interio]{.underline}**r. In this sense, the nineteenth
cen-tury's celebrated ''heart,'' experienced by its owner as **[the
bearer of archaic or recalcitrant sensations]{.underline}**, was **[the
laboring body's double, the flip side of the same coin of
industrialization. The fact that the wage system privat- ized domestic
activities also meant that they could be experienced as taking place in
a different time zone. In the home, time bound persons "back" to
"nature," a state of innocence that could be understood as restorative
only if women's domestic labor were fully effaced. If time becomes
history through its organization into a series of discrete units linked
by cause and effect, this organization in turn retrospectively con-
structs an imagined plenitude of "timeless" time to which history can
return and regroup.]{.underline}** Thus **[the [monumental]{.mark} or
sacred [time]{.mark}]{.underline}** that Kristeva also describes as
''Women's Time'' **[[does not escape chronobiopolitical
regulation]{.mark} either]{.underline}**. Luciano's crucial extension of
and intervention into Kristeva's work dem- onstrates that
**[[nations]{.mark} and other public forms of engroupment [depend not
only on progressive, linear time and the cyclical time that buttresses
it but also on the illusion that time can be suspended.]{.mark} Pauses
or [interrup- tions]{.mark} in the routinized rhythms of everyday life,
[in the sequences expected to unfold naturally from one another,
become]{.mark} the material for a people- hood experienced as [pre- or
a-political,]{.mark} as merely human.]{.underline}** In describing the
narrative texture of modern nationality, Homi Bhabha too refines **[the
distinction between linear-historical time and the more static times of
cyclic and monumental time: he describes the dialectic between a
[''peda- gogical'' time in which historical events seem to accrete
toward a given destiny, and a ''performative'' time in which a people
recreates itself]{.mark} as such through taking up a given activity
simultaneously.]{.underline}** Soliciting the masses to stop and feel
together, activities done in tandem with strangers seen and unseen, like
singing the national anthem or watching the Olym- pics, **[revivify
national belonging as a matter of shared emotion rather than civic
action.]{.underline}** Bhabha claims that **[within performative
strategies of national belonging, fissures can open up to suggest other
historical moments or ways of living.]{.underline}** And indeed, as
Luciano points out, **[in counterpoint to the time of factory life in
the antebellum United States, a set of ''performa- tive'' sensations and
corporeal forms was imagined, or even felt, not just as a contribution
to national destiny but also as an impediment to or bulwark against the
pedagogical time of history proper. Mourning and romance, empathy and
affection were not segmented into clock-time, even if highly ritualized
public performances like courtship and grieving did follow timelines;
the sentiments and their perceived rhythms coun-tered ''work time'' even
as they were also a product of it.]{.underline}** So did the time of
specific bodily needs. As Eli Zaretsky writes, ''The family, attuned to
the natural rhythms of eating, sleeping, and child care, can never be
wholly synchronized with the mechanized tempo of industrial capital-
ism." **[Emotional, domestic, and biological tempos are, though cultur-
ally constructed, somewhat less amenable to the speeding up and micro-
management that increasingly characterized U.S.
industrialization]{.underline}**. Time's Wounds As Luciano puts it,
**[[in the dialectic between linear-national history and
cyclical-domestic time, history appears as damaged time; time appears as
the plentitude that heals the historical subject. Time]{.mark}, then,
not only ["binds" flesh into bodies and bodies into social]{.mark} but
also appears to [''bind'' history's wounds.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But
the figure of damaged time also became the signa- ture of
late-nineteenth-century decadence and modernism. Of course, **[the
appearance of sexual identity as a field of knowledge and
self-description was part of a more general movement toward the
abstraction and tax- onomizing of human qualities, the reification of
both space and time, that began with industrial
capitalism.]{.underline}** In this sense, **[homosexual identity was
simply the product of a historical moment in time. But [sexual dissi-
dents have]{.mark} also in many ways [been produced by]{.mark}, or at
least emerged in tandem with, a sense of ["modern"
temporality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The double-time of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was somewhat different from the
highly gendered, sacred time of antebellum domesticity**[: rather than
evoking timelessness, [it trafficked in signs of fractured time]{.mark}.
Its signature was [interruptive archaisms: flickering signs of other
histori- cal moments and possibilities that materialized time as always
already wounded]{.mark}. Thus [gay men, lesbians, and other ''perverts''
have also served as figures for history, for either civilization's
decline or a sublimely fu- turistic release from nature, or
both]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here we might cite, for instance, the poet
Renée Vivien's Sapphic vampires, the novelist Djuna Barnes's hybrid
animal/child/lesbian Robin Vote, or T. S. Eliot's sexually alien- ated
J. Alfred Prufrock declaring himself to be ''Lazarus, come from the
dead!'' **[[Sexual dissidents became]{.mark} figures for and [bearers of
new cor- poreal sensations,]{.mark} including those of a certain
[counterpoint between now and then,]{.mark} and of occasional
[disruptions to the sped-up and hyperregu- lated time of
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Freud's concept of the unconscious
acknowledged exactly this doubled time: it relocated modernity's
temporal splittings into the psyche's in- terior (and thus from their
moorings in historically specific changes). Freud theorized the
''normal'' self as a temporal phenomenon, the ego as a manifestation of
displaced and disavowed past experiences. The Freud- ian unconscious
refused to make an experience obsolete or to relegate it to the past;
within the Freudian paradigm that Laplanche and Pontalis term
Nachträglichkeit, or deferred action, the mind recorded the signs of an
event when the subject could not consciously process its meaning, and
preserved these signs for future uses.≤≥ So even as an emerging consumer
market and what Foucault calls the ''incitement to discourse'' about
sexual types put an ever greater premium on novelty, the interlaced
models of the unconscious and Nachträglichkeit insisted on a certain
semiotic re- calcitrance. And in Freud, what we might now claim as a
queer intem- pestivity evidenced itself in and with the body as well as
the emotions. The repetitions and returns that disturb the Freudian
subject appear not as pictorial or narrative memories per se but in
forms that are at once metaphorical and visceral: a ''slip of the
tongue,'' repetitive bodily acts, lingering symptoms with no apparent
physical etiology. In this sense, the ''perverse'' Freudian body itself
became the scene of and catalyst for en- countering and redistributing
the past. This was particularly true of the body erotic. As early as the
eighteenth century, Henry Abelove and Paul Morrison have argued, erotic
life began to assume the contours of mechanized productivity, and
specific sexual practices came to be seen as ''foreplay,'' acceptable en
route to intercourse but not as a substitute for it.≤∂ In Freud's
update, these practices were remnants of childhood itself, not merely
adult means to an orgasmic end. Psychologizing what had once been
biological paradigms, Freud identi- fied taboo sexual practices as
normal childhood behavior in which the pathological adult subject was
simply stuck or frozen due to an inability to remember, conceptualize,
or narrate past events. Orality, anality, fe- tishism, and so onthat lie
became, in the Freudian itinerary, places that chil- dren visited on
their way to reproductive, genital heterosexuality, but not places to
stay for long. **[This stubborn [lingering of
pastness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (whether it appears as **[[anachronis-
tic]{.underline}]{.mark}** style, as **[the r[eappearance]{.mark} of
bygone events]{.underline}** in the symptom, **[[or]{.mark} as [arrested
development) is a hallmark of queer affect: a
"revolution"]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the old sense of the word, **[as
a turning back.]{.underline}** Heather Love's Feeling Backward, for
instance, astutely diagnoses the '**['backwards'' emotions elaborated by
artists for whom the birth of the modern homosexual identity-form was
constraining rather than liberating: shame, passivity, melancholy, and
recoil, to name but a few, were ways of refusing the progressive logic
by which becoming ever more visible was correlated with achieving ever
more freedom]{.underline}**.≤∑ Late-nineteenth-century perverts,
melancholically at- tached to obsolete erotic objects or fetishes they
ought to have outgrown, or repeating unproductive bodily behaviors over
and over, also used **[pas- tess to [resist the commodity-time of speedy
manufacture and planned obsolescence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### [In the contemporary digital era emerging technologies are no longer material but rather are subjective and ideological constructions grounded in the erasure of queered difference -- normative technological computation and the system of laws that proceed from it form an infrastructure of control structured to maximize the functionality of technology while effacing its inextricable relationship to queer life -- only a queer digital aesthesis can solve.]{.underline}

Queer DH Methodologies: Inspiration from Existing Work While queer
studies can usefully employ DH tools and practices to produce
scholarship focused on queer subjects, it is also important to examine
how [queer theory can inform current and future digital humanities
methodologies.]{.underline} One of the key areas of debate in DH is [the
role that computing plays]{.underline} in differentiating DH from other
modes of humanities scholarship. Some have argued that the digital
humanities' narrow focus on computation has led the field to imagine
itself, supposedly like computation itself, as free from concerns of
economics, race, gender, and sexuality. As Alan Liu observes, "While
digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically . . .
rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society,
economics, politics, or culture. How the digital humanities advances,
channels, or resists today's great postindustrial, neoliberal,
corporate, and global flows of information-cum-capital is thus a
question rarely heard in the digital humanities" (Liu, web). Liu goes on
to argue that DH [must develop a "methodological infrastructure" that
unites computational and cultural criticism]{.underline}. Similarly,
Roopika Risam, in her essay on intersectionality in DH, suggests four
areas in which the digital humanities need to develop in order to create
a more inclusive and [socially engaged standard of practice:
"cultivating a diverse community," "acknowledging inclusions and
exclusions in data," applying "theoretical models that position
intersectionality as an already existing but oft-overlooked part of
computation]{.underline}," and developing [systems "for understanding
the ways difference \[or lack thereof\] shapes digital
practices]{.underline}" (Risam). Liu's and Risam's critiques make it
clear that currently dominant DH methodologies are not sufficient for
the development of [a queerly inflected digital]{.underline} humanities.
The last two areas of development mentioned by Risam (theoretical models
in which to identify existing intersectionalities and systems for
understanding how difference shapes computation) are of particular
interest to the present project. They [suggest a queer DH praxis that is
distinguished from mainstream DH through its conceptual
models]{.underline}---models that can usefully be informed by queer
theory. To draw from key questions that queer theory has asked in
literary and historical studies, [how can we discover, uncover, and
recover the queerness (in its various intersectional manifestations) in
computation, as well the effects that queerness has had on computing and
the potential effects it could have in the future]{.underline}? To date,
this praxis has taken the form of speculating on [the interconnected
histories of queerness and computing, imagining the queering of the
fundamental structures of computing technologies, conceptualizing
queerness itself as a technology, exploring the queerness of code, and
utilizing concepts of "speculative computing" to enact queer
work.]{.underline} A number of these existing works can help us think
about queer methodologies for DH. A generative starting point is Kara
Keeling's "Queer OS," which outlines the properties of an imagined
[queer operating system that itself offers new frameworks for making
sense of society and identity. I]{.underline}n Keeling's formulation,
inspired by Tara McPherson, Queer OS is "a project at the [interfaces of
queer theory, new media studies, and technology studies" that structures
itself around the logics of queerness]{.underline} (153). Keeling's
Queer OS, should it exist, would [understand cultural phenomena like
"race, gender, class, citizenship, and ability . . . to be mutually
constitutive with sexuality and with media and information
technologies.]{.underline}" Keeling continues: "Queer OS names [a way of
thinking and acting with, about, through, among, and at times even in
spite of new media technologies and other phenomena of mediation. It
insists upon forging and facilitating uncommon, irrational, imaginative,
and/or unpredictable relationships" between human subjects and digital
medi]{.underline}a (154). As a launching point for imagining queer DH
methodologies, Keeling's Queer OS can be read as an imperative for queer
DH scholars to e[mbrace the complex and often contradictory tangle of
intersectional investigation. I]{.underline}t also directs DH
researchers more generally to understand computing not as outside of
social issues but rather as shaping and indeed being shaped by cultural
determinants. In addition to informing our vision of a queer digital
humanities, Keeling's essay has inspired others to interrogate the
intersection of queerness and DH. In their 2016 piece, "Queer OS: A
User's Manual," Barnett and colleagues take up Keeling's call to
conceptualize a Queer OS, which, the authors point out, "remains a
largely speculative project" (50). However, as the authors themselves
point out, [the speculative operations of the queer system shouldn't
necessarily conform to conventional notions of
functionality]{.underline}. To the contrary, they state, \[Our goal\] is
to engage with [the challenge of understanding queerness today as
operating on and through digital media and the digital humanities. Our
intervention therefore seeks to address what we perceive as a lack of
queer, trans, and racial analysis in the digital humanities, as well as
the challenges of imbricating queer/trans/racialized lives and building
digital/technical architectures that do not replicate existing systems
of oppression.]{.underline} As such this is a [speculative proposition
for a technical project that does not yet exist and may never come to
exist, a project that does not yet function and may never
function.]{.underline} (51) The "user's manual" the essay provides [is a
provocative queer reimagining of what form and role various key
components in digital computing (such as interfaces, applications, and
memory) might take, with "each component given a poetical and
theoretical description of its features and limitations]{.underline}"
(50). While these descriptions inspire the reader to imagine a potential
future in which computing is more in line with the ethos of queerness,
some readers may ask where, in the present, we might identify the
beginning points that might lead us toward a concrete instantiation of a
Queer OS and, along with it, a queer DH. DH practitioners who are
themselves queer and therefore potentially marginalized subjects working
within the reward and accreditation structures of contemporary academia
may feel that they need to produce work of a more tangible sort than
"theoretical vapourware, speculative potentialware, ephemeral praxis"
(51). These individuals may wish to (or feel the need to) develop
computing technology that shares meaningful connections with this
theoretical work but that does not itself embody "an unreliable system
full of precarity" with an "inherent instability," given the already
precarious position of many queer subjects within the digital humanities
(54). In order to further explore the trajectories along which queer DH
might unfold, we turn next to three of the scholarly works from which
Keeling draws. The first is Jacob Gaboury's series of articles titled "A
Queer History of Computing." [One question that vexes the development of
a queer DH is how to theorize the relationship between queerness and the
ways in which computing itself can enact queer erasure.]{.underline} In
his piece, Gaboury addresses this tension through a discussion of Alan
Turing and other figures from the history of computing whom Turing
influenced. Though Turing is considered to be a central figure in the
development of modern computing, rarely have conceptualizations of his
work overlapped with discussions of his queerness or the injustices he
suffered at the hands of the British government. Gaboury recognizes that
any claims about a direct correlation between Turing's sexuality and his
theories of computation would be problematic. To posit that the former
"inspired" the latter would be simplistic, says Gaboury, yet to conclude
that no relationship exists between the two "parses what is
technologically significant in such a way so as to exclude the personal,
the emotional, and the sexual" (Gaboury). Faced with the problem of
articulating how [the sexual signifies within the
technological,]{.underline} Gaboury traces [historical connections
between a community of queer figures who played key roles in the early
history of computing. T]{.underline}hough it remains unclear what direct
effects sexuality may have had on their work, Gaboury finds [value in
refiguring their production through a "speculative history" that
foregrounds the oft-elided place of queerness.]{.underline} This type of
[fabrication (i.e., speculation) resonates in unexpected ways with the
digital humanities practices of critical making.]{.underline} Gaboury's
history of computing both extends and problematizes DH methodologies by
recasting making as "making up." Additionally, Gaboury's focus on
[historical absence---the suppressed, missing, unrecorded, and always
partial nature of queerness in the history of computing---points toward
the restorative work that could be done by a queer digital
humanities]{.underline}. Turing's place within the history of artificial
intelligence connects Gaboury's work to Jack Halberstam's earlier essay
"Automating Gender: Postmodern Feminism in the Age of the Intelligent
Machine." Halberstam's essay too provides useful models for
conceptualizing a queer digital humanities. "Automating Gender" offers,
among other things, a [critique of feminist theories that rely on
reductive ideas of phallotechnocracy and essentialist conceptions of
gender]{.underline}. Like Gaboury, Halberstam looks to Turing to counter
these narratives. [What is now commonly referred to as the "Turing
Test," Halberstam points out, began as a "sexual guessing game" in which
an interrogator attempted to determine the genders of players as they
answer questions via technological mediation. "Turing does not stress
the obvious connection between gender and computer intelligence," writes
Halberstam. However, "both are in fact imitative systems, and the
boundaries between female and male . . . are as unclear and as unstable
as the boundary between human and machine intelligence. . . . Gender,
like intelligence, has a technology]{.underline}" (443).2 To illuminate
this [unstable binary between the human and the machine]{.underline},
Halberstam takes up [Donna Haraway's delineation of the female cyborg as
a representation of technology's ability to transcend binary
structures.]{.underline} Given that [queerness, unlike essentialized
gender or sexuality, has been closely aligned with artificiality,
unnaturalness, imitation, and the subversion of binaries, one might
describe Haraway's cyborg as queer---and, by extension, Halberstam's
vision of cyborg technology as queer technology]{.underline}. In
addition to [envisioning technology as queer, Halberstam implicitly
posits queerness itself as a technology. Such]{.underline} a formulation
suggests [a symbiotic, dialectic relationship between technology and
queerness. I]{.underline}t also suggests that [the interface between
human and computing technology might be understood as a space of queer
intimacy and relation]{.underline}. Placed within our discussion of
digital humanities methodologies, "Automating Gender" challenges us to
account for the ways in [which gender and sexuality are in fact
inextricable from computational systems.]{.underline} Another valuable
touchstone for interrogating the relationship between queerness and the
digital is Blas's Queer Technologies project, mentioned above, which
similarly turns to Turing in theorizing the relationship between
queerness and computation. "For us," write Blas with his collaborator
cárdenas in an article outlining the work of Queer Technologies,
"[Turing is a crucial historical figure for thinking the politics of
digital technologies from queer and feminist perspectives]{.underline}"
(2). Yet, perhaps more than a historical figure, Turing appears here as
a founder of queer computational thinking. Did Turing's homosexuality
affect his research? Blas and cárdenas answer this question with a
resounding yes. "[The drives and assumptions of a heterosexual sexuality
produce certain ways of producing and knowing that can be embodied in
objects created by heterosexual scientists]{.underline}," they assert.
"Similarly, [homosexual desires can inform and help to materially
construct the technicity of objects."]{.underline} That is, for Blas and
cárdenas, [the very logics around which contemporary computation has
been founded are shaped by Turing's queerness]{.underline}. Fittingly,
it seems that [the impulse behind the many artistic works that make up
the Queer Technologies project is to reimbue or perhaps rediscover the
queerness in computational technology]{.underline}. Of these works, the
one of most interest here is Blas's [transCoder, which Blas describes as
"a queer programming anti-language." Works written using transCoder are
not executable]{.underline}. Instead, transCoder [functions primarily as
a critical]{.underline} tool---in Mark C. Marino's words, "[a
theoretical software development kit, made not of functional functions
but of encoded plays on the methods and discourse of critical
theory]{.underline}" ("Of Sex," 187). As [an unexecutable coding
language, transCoder suggests a suite of approaches to queer digital
humanities methodologies that play with failure and loss]{.underline}.
We will return to reflect on the critical concerns that surround failure
below. Still, our vision of a queer DH must account for an investigation
of the times when technologies, like heteronormative modes of meaning,
break down. Queer Technologies models how practice-based work might
speak to potential queer DH methodologies. It also directs us to
consider t[he queer potential of other forms of digital
praxis.]{.underline} transCoder can be seen as a queer application of
what has been called codework. [Codework subverts the tenets of
"well-written" code: simplicity, functionality, transparency, and
legibility.]{.underline} Examples of codework range from the
nonexecutable net.art creations of "Mez" (Mary-Ann Breeze), written in a
hybrid language called "m\[ez\]ang.elle," to obfuscated code and
esoteric programming languages ("esolangs"). In "Interferences:
\[Net.Writing\] and the Practice of Codework," Rita Raley notes that
codework allows [programming languages to break the surface, rather than
simply leveraging them to perform the invisible labors of technology.
This refiguration of code---as elusive, hidden, and ultimately
uncontrollable---resonates with queer theory's notion of queer meaning
as similarly submerged and anxiogenic.]{.underline} Referring to Jessica
Loseby's net.art work Code Scares Me, Raley notes how it thematizes
"[anxieties about \[the\] intrusion, contamination, and
uncontrollability" of code (Raley). Like queerness as interpreted by
many queer literary scholars, code in Raley's formulation becomes
monstrous, invisible, unknowable, and alien: "It lurks beneath the
surface of the text. . . . The fear, further, is that code is
autopoietic and capable of eluding . . . attempts to domesticate it and
bring it into order]{.underline}." Practitioners of codework, Raley
observes, see their [production as expressly political; it resists
assumptions about the neutrality of programming, reclaims code from
corporate functionalism, and repurposes the pragmatic as the aesthetic.
Such sentiments stand in contrast to the seemingly apolitical
sensibilities of programmer communities dedicated to composing
obfuscated code]{.underline} and esolangs. These practices tend to fall
into the domain of professional programmers for whom testing the
boundaries of coding represents an opportunity to demonstrate mastery.
Yet obfuscated code and esolangs too represent potentially generative
modes of queer DH methodologies. They refuse established expectations
for readability and intentionally [walk an anxious line between the
domestication of code and code's refusal to "be brought into
order."]{.underline}3 This discussion of esolangs brings us to the last
work from which we draw inspiration for our vision of queer DH
methodologies. This is what Johanna Drucker has termed "[speculative
computing."]{.underline} As Drucker recounts in her book SpecLab,
speculative computing [emerges from a "productive tension" within the
digital humanities. Specifically, speculative computing aims to invert
DH's focus on the use of digital tools]{.underline} in humanities
scholarship by [focusing instead on the development of "humanities tools
in digital environments]{.underline}" (Drucker, xi). Extending the
conceptual stakes of speculative computing, Drucker [advances a theory
called "aesthesis," which foregrounds "partial, situated, and subjective
knowledge" and proposes imaginative play with digital objects as an
antidote to the totalizing authority of meaning. "Aesthesis," writes
Drucker, "allows us to insist on the value of subjectivity that is
central to aesthetic artifacts . . . and to place that subjectivity at
the core of knowledge production"]{.underline} (Drucker, xiii). In
Drucker's characterization[, speculative computing takes seriously the
destabilization of categories, including taxonomies of entity, identity,
object, subject, interactivity, process, and instrument. In short,
speculative computing rejects mechanistic and instrumental approaches,
replacing them with indeterminacy and potentiality, intersubjectivity,
and deformance.]{.underline} Speculative computing operates as a
critique of the computational logics that structure much digital
humanities scholarship. While Drucker does not mention queerness in
SpecLab, her work gives voice to an ethos that could serve as a powerful
directive for the queer digital humanities. [A queer DH would extend the
"otherness" that speculative computing enacts by focusing deliberately
on issues concerning gender and sexuality in computing.]{.underline}
Like queerness itself, the methodologies of a queer digital humanities
must not be monolithic. Indeed, [with its resistance to totalizing
knowledge, speculative computing demonstrates the importance of
methodological diversity.]{.underline} Accordingly, we believe that
[modes of queer DH scholarship must themselves be multivalent,
multiplicative, and self-critical: a set of practices in
flux]{.underline}. Taken together, the works considered in this section
challenge us to think about queerness in digital humanities
methodologies as a matter of fundamental computational structures, as
well as (if not more than) a matter of content. These works also
encourage us to reflect on the foundational role that intersectional
issues related to gender and sexuality play in the formation of new
media and digital tools. They insist upon [the importance of queer
thinking within the history of computation; they delineate the queerness
of technology as well as the technology of queerness]{.underline}. Some
of the research we have discussed employs traditional scholarly methods.
Equally compelling, other works make their arguments [through
fabrication and artistic interpretation.]{.underline} In our vision, a
queer digital humanities too stands [poised at the intersection of
critique and creation]{.underline}. Drawing from these conceptual
frameworks, queer DH itself [emerges cyborg-like: a playful
methodological hybrid of perspectives, tools, and meaning.]{.underline}

#### [This resolution calls us to know the world through technology which is to engage in an intimate encounter with queerness -- technologies are not static or rigid but rather are malleable, unstable, and deconstructible -- the ontological indeterminacy of queerness is the generative point for digital possibilities.]{.underline}

Ontology after the Normal Responding in part to [the limitations of a
discursive politics built upon the implicit corporal malleability of
social constructionism, queer and fem- inist theorists have been
articulating a weirder and less determined un- derstanding of
embodiment]{.underline} for some time. As heralded through a variety of
turns and critical réévaluations (see, for example, Clough and Halley
2007; Coole and Frost 2010; Mortimer- Sandilands and Erickson 2010),
[these more complicated ontologies understand a body as more distribut-
ed, less human, and dynamically undone through strange
temporalities]{.underline} encompassing food, plastic, and distant
relatives (Landecker 201 1). Both [drawing from and intervening in the
natural sciences, this new attention to matter and embodiment has
produced exciting new interventions in fields like physics]{.underline}
(Barad 2007), [biology]{.underline} (Wilson 2010; 2015), [and neu-
roscience]{.underline} (Pitts-Taylor 2016). While fruitful, [moving
queerness from its discursive and deconstructive roots to a more
generative and ecological ontology has provided the politics of queer
indeterminacy with some un- comfortable mirrors]{.underline}. The
scientific [uptake of a postnormal biological ontology has led to a
productive réévaluation in feminist and queer social theory of the in-
herent political value of indeterminacy]{.underline}. The increasing
body of research [highlighting the strong, temporally strange
\"epi\"]{.underline} (i.e., socioenvironmen- tal) [influence on
genetics]{.underline} (Landecker 201 1) [has both usefully complicated
deterministic ideas about genetic inheritance]{.underline} (Lock 2005)
and lead to troubling suggestions of state management of pregnant bodies
(Bateson 2001, 932-33). While [the notion of the body as an autopoietic
system guarding against the harmful outside world is increasingly
superseded by a queerer, more flexible looping process of body formation
in action, the politics of this move are unsettled as well]{.underline}
(Maturana and Varela 1980). Victoria Pitts-Taylor, for example, has
explored how plastic notions of the brain can be smoothly resonant with
a \"neoliberal logic of self-care and responsibility\" (2010, 639),
while Catherine Malabou looks at the trauma of war and the ways that
brain plasticity and an ontological openness can be radically
destructive to subjects (2012). While scientists are just begin- ning to
recognize the vital role of nonhuman cells in regulating the body, once
[speculative moves to queer the notion of the subject beyond the human,
bounded body, or even the organism]{.underline} (Clough 2012) are becom-
ing increasingly widespread. This [opens up possibilities for new
alliances and deeper connections as well as new ground for military and
biomedical intervention and modulation]{.underline} (Cooper 2008). [The
interest in indeterminacy in the life sciences finds increasing paral-
lels in the computer sciences. More precisely, the biodigital is
converging in ways that render the distinction less meaningful as the
body s capacity is leveraged, for example, by creating rewritable
digital data storage in live cells]{.underline} (Bonnet, Subsoontorn,
and Endy 2012). [There is also the growing field of machine learning;
notable in particular are \"neural\" systems of par- allel algorithms,
inspired by the stochastic and plastic human brain]{.underline}, which
learn how to perform tasks like scanning \"800 million people to find a
sin- gle face in 5 seconds\" (Hemsoth 2015). More speculative are the
moves to harness indeterminacy at the small- est scales of matter.
[Nanotechnologies involve computational bioengi- neering of materials
\"before they become qualified in a specific form or
function\"]{.underline} (Parisi 2012, 38). For Parisi, [this is the
extension of affect, that realm of precognitive capacity, away from life
and the organism in order to see an indeterminate potential at the heart
of all matter]{.underline}. Parisi writes of the futurai potential of
\"programmable matter\" designed to operate in a specu- lative
environment of emergent relations and unknown equations (40). This is an
[indeterminacy with vast potential for instrumentalized capital-
ization - a paradoxical indeterminacy where \"nano-ergonomic control
indeed leaves nothing to approximation and yet its precise design
remains infinitely open]{.underline},\" such that nanotech is \"[almost
designed to remain exact but uncertain]{.underline}\" (46). This vision
is of capitalism well beyond the normal, a new kind of postprobabilistic
modulation where \"if control is investing in chaos, it is because it is
working to grasp the randomness\" (37). [While the technoscientific
uptake of ontological indeterminacy re- quires an ongoing interrogation
of the queer political project, it also sug- gests a unique opportunity
for both biopolitical critique and, essentially, queer
experimentation.]{.underline} As the tracking and sensing technologies
of the everyday rearticulate embodiment and environment, [queerness can
more forcefully articulate a vision of indeterminacy that whisks away
from capi- talization and is bent toward thoughtful interconnection and
the perverse proliferation of pleasures and expressions.]{.underline}

State and Nation Formation How does Queer IR scholarship help us to
understand state and nation formation? Like Mainstream IR scholars,
[Queer IR scholars study the historical rise of the modern interstate
system, contemporary examples of state-building, and the politics of
nationalism and national political identification
practices.]{.underline} Like the work of Feminist and Gender scholars,
Queer IR scholarship examines [the role of gendered norms and identities
in past and present processes of state and nation formation and thus the
social construction of states, nations, and national
identities.]{.underline} Taking these concerns further, Queer IR
scholars study these in the register of sexuality. A classic argument in
Queer IR on state and nation formation is V. Spike Peterson's
(1999,2013) scholarship on "[nationalism as heterosexism.]{.underline}"
Peterson's research investigates how [state and nation formation is not
only socially constructed but works through ongoing processes of
reproduction, resistance, and reconfiguration.]{.underline} Peterson's
Queer IR scholarship [evidences the central role of gender and
heteronormative norms and institutions in imagining or inventing
nations, nationalism, and national identities. Drawing attention to how
gendered and sexualized normativities fuel political identification
processes and conflict]{.underline}, Peterson [challenges state-centric
conceptualizations of national groups and political
identities]{.underline} found in Mainstream IR. Her queer analysis also
challenges the implicit heterosexism underwriting much of the feminist
scholarship on the fundamental role of gender identity and hegemonic
masculinity for national identityconstruction. Peterson argues that
[early state-making processes were generative of gendered and sexualized
norms and normativities, including heteropatriarchal marriage and
family]{.underline}. In short, ["making states makes sex"
(]{.underline}Peterson, 2014A, p. 390). Peterson's most recent work
pursues these concerns through registers of intimacy in relation to
heteronormativities and homonormativities (2014a, 2016). A prominent
example for Queer IR scholarship that shows how [state and nation
formation is not a one-off occurrence but an ongoing
process]{.underline} is the work of Cynthia Weber (1998A,1999, 2016A).
Weber's Queer IR scholarship on U.S.-Caribbean relations after the Cuban
Revolution, for example, demonstrates how [sovereign nation-states
mobilized what she calls "queer performativities" in
practice.]{.underline} Weber agrees with mainstream IR theorists
thatmany [U.S. policymakers and military officials perceived the Cuban
Revolution as a crisis that jeopardized U.S. hegemony in the Caribbean
region.]{.underline} By extending Mainstream,Feminist, and Gender
analyses into the realm of Queer IR, Weber argues that [this crisis of
hegemony was related to two further U.S. crises---a masculinity
crisis]{.underline} (which feminist andgender scholars identify) [and a
heterosexuality crisis]{.underline} (which Queer IR scholars
identify).Weber reads key U.S. foreign policy documents and speeches to
show how, contrary towhat one would expect, [the United States addressed
these crises of hegemony, masculinity, and heterosexuality by using what
she called "queer compensatory strategies"---strategies that refigured
the U.S. state in its Caribbean relations as queer(i.e., non-normative
in relation to the gender and sexuality of the figural U.S. body
politicthat appears in these documents) in order to appear to be
hegemonically heteromasculine.]{.underline} Weber followed up on these
classic Queer IR texts in her recent bookQueer InternationalRelations:
Sovereignty, Sexuality and the Will to Knowledge, where she explains
some ofthe broader domestic and international sexualized logics at work
in both state and nationformation and in the organization of
international politics. Through her queerreconsideration of Richard
Ashley's work on "statecraft as mancraft" (see Queer IRMethods section
above), Weber explains how what she calls ["queer logics of statecraft"
function in domestic and international politics to create what she calls
"sexualized organizations of international relations"
(]{.underline}2016a, 2016b). Recent Queer IR scholarship on sexual
justice struggles show that contestations overLGBT rights have come to
constitute a key terrain of state- and nation-building and
theconstruction of supranational identity---both among proponents and
opponents of LGBTrights. For example, Lind and Keating's (2013) work on
[postcolonial state-building in thecontext of Ecuador's recent turn away
from neoliberalism shows that in the quest tocentralize authority, the
Ecuadorian state relied on a mix of state homophobia and what they call
state "homoprotectionism."]{.underline} Other Queer IR research on
state- and nation-building argues that "the international"consists not
only of states and international organizations but also non-state
institutionsand queer popular culture. Catherine Baker (2016), for
instance, conceptualizes theEurovision Song Contest as a
popular-cultural text/event produced by a non-stateinternational actor
as an important sight and site of international relations.

#### [Thus we affirm queer cyborg writing, a liberatory methodological queering of the contemporary technosphere that embraces a symbiotic subjectivity between human and machine and deconstructs the normative binaries that structure the social order of modernity.]{.underline}

[The Cyborg as a figure in popular culture---the body in a literal state
of "human/machine symbiosis]{.underline}" (Katherine Hayles How We
Became Posthuman 112)---[is often conceived as a monstrous figure, as a
figure of otherness, a being whose status as a hybrid has made it less
deserving of the title of humanit]{.underline}y. The Cyborg, when
portrayed as an inhuman monster, has "[always defined the limits of
community in the western imagination]{.underline}" (Donna Haraway The
Cyborg Manifesto 64). However, in embracing this hybrid status[, the
Cyborg need not remain a subhuman Other, but rather, can become the
figure in which queer and repressed bodies might break free from the
constraints that their normative culture places on them.]{.underline}
This essay argues that the [Cyborg, under critical posthumanist and
queer theory, can range from hybrid subjectivities grafted to the human
body, or inhuman bodies fused with human subjectivities, to bodies that
have found an equilibrium in both their human/machine avatars, and
finally, to figures that have become cyborgs of both the body and the
mind.]{.underline} Subjectivity, throughout this essay, refers to how a
creature sees its world, and how that creature sees and defines itself
as a part of that world. [A human's subjectivity, for example, might
involve an understanding of linear time and mortality, and an
understanding of who they are in relation to others. A dog's
subjectivity, by contrast, might be similar to the human's, but not
identical, with]{.underline} its subjective understanding of time, and
certainly of social structures, differing[. How a machine or
extraterrestrial might perceive themselves and their universe is further
still from what the human subjectivity perceives]{.underline}. In short,
subjectivity will be used as a shorthand for how characters are capable
of thinking about their external and internal worlds. This Mind and Body
Cyborg as a queer figure raises its head in Amal El-Mohtar and Max
Gladstone's 2019 epistolary novel This Is How You Lose the Time War, as
two Cyborg bodies shed their previous subjectivities in order to find a
queer understanding of one another. Through their altered
subjectivities, [the post-human Cyborg as a queer figure is one that can
flourish and reach out to one another in new forms of \"Cyborg
writing]{.underline}\" (Haraway 54) that [the \"pure\" human world could
never achieve.]{.underline} This is How You Lose The Time War opens with
each of the two protagonists already in possession of two separate types
of Cyborg bodies. Red---the agent of a post-singularity \"techy-mechy
dystopia" (El-Mohtar & Gladstone 36)---represents the most traditional
figure of the Cyborg as a human/machine symbiosis, whose "gyroscopes
whir in her gut, lenses click beneath the camouflage jelly of those pure
black eyes" (14). She operates in a world where these enhancements and
implantations are not invasive but natural. Blue---Red's initial
opponent, and eventual romantic partner---descends from an opposing
"viny-hivey elfworld" (36) future. Blue exists as a body in symbiosis
not with the traditional artifice of technology but with a sentient
nature represented as "Garden" (6). "Garden" stands as a potential
alternative future to the AI intelligence of "Agency" (6) that created
Red. To continue to call Blue a literal Cyborg is to acknowledge how
"plant sentience and intelligence are \[...\] explicitly associated with
the mediation of machines" (Teresa Castro The Mediated Plant 11). Blue
remains a figure of human/machine symbiosis, even if that machine has
taken a different form (that of a human/plant-machine). Like Red, Blue
sees her own body as natural, and Red's as the unnatural. She emphasizes
that while the Cyborgs of Red's world are created artificially and
decanted, the children of Garden are "grown \[...\] seeds planted, roots
combing through time" (El-Mohtar & Gladstone 126). The struggle to
overcome the dualisms of natural/unnatural is both a central conflict of
El-Mohtar and Gladstone\'s novel and [a critical project in queering the
figure of the Cyborg, the hybrid body focused on breaking down the
dualisms and binaries of normative human culture.]{.underline} When This
Is How You Lose the Time War speaks of being infected by or
\"infiltrated\" (8) by one another both mentally and physically, Red and
Blue often speak of the act of reading as the most potent infiltration
point for the writer. In a letter, Red---one of the two correspondents
of the novel---acknowledges that their reading of each other has "built
a you within me, or you have" (94). The novel treats the act of reading
and writing as a way for Red and Blue to [trigger personal
\"apocalypses\" (defined below) of their subjective notions of purity
and otherness within one another, with writing creating not new moments,
but new worlds.]{.underline} "Letters are structures, not events. Yours
give me a place to live inside" (94) argues Red, illustrating how Blue's
words alone have restructured her sense of self, and her sense of
belonging. [The novel\'s preoccupation with ways to instigate such
personal apocalypses mirrors the very literal apocalypses on a planetary
scale that both Red and Blue seek to trigger through history, travelling
\"upthread into the stable past or downthread into the fraying future\"
(10) to infect and destroy timelines by changing events in an attempt to
"preserve what matters \[for their own sides\] and let what doesn\'t
fall to dust: mulch for the more perfect future\'s seed\"]{.underline}
(El-Mohtar & Gladstone 60). [The planetary apocalypses throughout the
story intend not to end the world, but to radically alter it. As I
explain below, this is a posthumanist application of the term
apocalypse]{.underline}, and the one best applied to how Time War treats
change in both character and world. [Creating not the physical but the
cognitive Cyborg always requires these apocalyptic rearrangings of
subjectivity in order to wipe away the binaries and dualisms of
traditional human culture---binaries such as the strict gender norms of
man/woman in a single binary (hetero) normative sexuality, or the
dualisms of self/other, human/inhuman, or us/them that would keep the
figure of the Queer Cyborg constrained]{.underline}. As Time War applies
apocalypse on a global scale by rewriting events, it applies apocalypse
on the subjective scale through Red and Blue's literal writing of
themselves and each other. Apocalypse, as applied to subjectivity, is
not the \"end to the physical world, per se, but the world as structured
for the characters\" (Glazier, Beck 5). Looking outside of Time War, the
cognitive Cyborg received its post-apocalyptic birth in literature by
coming into contact with transformative and apocalyptic writing. In Ted
Chiang's novella Story of Your Life, the protagonist Louise Banks
correctly identifies how her personal apocalypse and global/societal
apocalypse coincide "when ships appeared in orbit and artifacts appeared
in meadows" (Chiang 2). In Chiang's global apocalypse, the mere arrival
of the alien is enough, as the presence of otherworldly beings forces
the Earth to re-examine the idea of \"human exceptionalism\" (7) that is
assumed by humanism. However, while the mere arrival of the Heptapods is
the epoch for the global apocalypse in Chiang, for Louise, their arrival
is only "how it began" (Chiang 2). While Story of Your Life only briefly
concerns itself with the global apocalypse that the Heptapods herald,
Chiang's narrative keeps its focus on Louise\'s more personal
apocalypse: the restructuring of her subjectivity. The radical change to
Louise's subjectivity goes beyond the presence of the alien, and
actually hinges on the insights forced onto Louise by the Heptapods\'
languages, and more specifically the Heptapods\' written language, which
gives birth to Louise's own "unique sense of apocalypse" (Glazier, Beck
5). The Heptapods' written language---what Louise refers to as "Heptapod
B" (Chiang 14)---suggests a version of temporality unlike the
"sequential mode of awareness" (31) that Louise had previously
experienced. Where human language---analogue language---uses separate
symbols to act as signified/signifier for one another, Heptapod B
suggests a \"digital\" mode of temporality, where there are no separate
words or terms that can represent signified or signifier (Glazier, Beck
12). The Heptapods "experience events all at once" (Chiang 31) without
being bound to sequence or linear cause and effect, and they express
this "simultaneous mode of consciousness" (Chiang 32) through Heptapod
B. Louise's pre-apocalyptic life was "before \[she\] learned to think in
Heptapod B" (Chiang 35). While there are instances where Louise truly
experiences "past and future all at once" (36) as Heptapods do,
Louise\'s subjectivity becomes "an amalgam of human and Heptapod"
(Chiang 35). Instead of becoming entirely digital, as the Heptapods are,
Louise\'s after(-)life is one which must incorporate both her previous
human language and the \"memories of destiny\" (Glazier, Beck 16).
Through these changes in language and writing, Louise revises her
concept of the subject, as it forces her to reconcile different
identities through her life. Her new subjectivity revises her many
identities through time as single, married, divorced, childless,
pregnant, a mother, and a mother grieving for her child into a single
digital sense of self. The personal apocalypse that Louise experiences
through this new language is one that shatters her humanist, static
identity of \"I\" into an \"I\" of many simultaneous \"multiple selves\"
(16). Louise\'s apocalypse ultimately results in not only a change but a
radical expansion in her subjectivity. Chiang's narrative then creates a
type of cognitive Cyborg with an entirely "pure" physical human body,
but a mind that has become a fusion, with an inhuman understanding being
fused to a human subjectivity. However, the cognitive Cyborg can go
further in muddling notions of human purity, as can be seen in Alan
Moore\'s Saga of the Swamp Thing: Book One. In the comic, the
protagonist initially believes himself to be only a literal fusion of
plant and a human body, akin to the physical human/plant-machine
symbiosis of Time War's Blue. Though his subjective understanding of
self has incorporated an inhuman body, he still maintains a self-image
of a purely human existence underneath, separate and apart from the
inhuman. But this notion of human purity is destroyed through contact
with writing, when Swamp Thing stumbles upon writing about himself and
his own nature. This writing reveals the origin and truth of Swamp
Thing's body and creation: he is not a human within a monstrous figure
but \"a mass of plant fiber that had somehow been infected with the
consciousness of Alec Holland\" (66). Returning to the idea of
subjectivity being an infection, Swamp Thing becomes the inverse of
Louise from Story of Your Life, an entirely alien body of inhuman
origin, whose subjective understanding of the world and the self has
become more like the human. Swamp Thing's subjective self after this
apocalyptic revelation is no longer that of Time War's Blue, but a new
cognitive symbiosis of human consciousness/plant-machine body. As with
Time War, the figure of Moore's comic had already begun as a kind of
physical hybrid, but only through writing do they become a new kind of
Cyborg through a fusion of human/artifice within the mind alone, free to
cast off the constraints of their previous understanding of the self.
The Cyborg of the mind, or the cognitive Cyborg, exists not in
opposition to Hayles's physical Cyborg, but as a less literal companion.
Andy Clarke, in Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the
Future of Human Intelligence, proposed that [a Cyborg could be created
out of any fusion between the \"pure\" human and the use of any artifice
that the human might use to express themselves or enable their
identities]{.underline}. Clarke alludes to the use of writing utensils,
[digital platforms, and other technologies that can become an extension
of the self without the literal \"intrusion of silicon and wire into
flesh and blood, as anyone who has felt himself thinking via the act of
writing already knows]{.underline}\" (Clarke 5). This [alternative
method of Cyborg creation suggests it is not the physical hybrid status
of the body that triggers the creation of the cognitive Cyborg, but how
writing may expose a body to new ways of thinking about
themselves.]{.underline} Returning to The Cyborg Manifesto, Haraway
argued that [Cyborg writing is \"about the power to survive, not on the
basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to
mark the world that marked them as other\"]{.underline} (55). This Is
How You Lose the Time War creates an opportunity for two characters to
[engage in Cyborg writing as an active, rather than passive process, as
they each receive their apocalypse through contact with the
writing.]{.underline} Neither Red nor Blue are limited to the role of
author or audience, but rather both serve as reader and writer for one
another, each allowing the other a chance to redefine what it means to
be a hybrid for both. Though Haraway originally posited how women of
colour might be understood as the "cyborg identity" (54) most powerfully
placed to be enabled through Cyborg writing, applying Cyborg theory to
narratives like This Is How You Lose the Time War shows how other "taboo
fusions" (52) that stray from the notions of purity that are "persistent
in western traditions" (59)---such as those inherent in
heteronormativity---might also be primed for the act of writing as a
transformative process. The letters sent and shared between Red and Blue
continually infect them throughout the narrative. In both purpose and
style, they evolve throughout the novel from only short taunts and cruel
allusions of what each believes the other's world to be like to a
"confession of real, curious ignorance\" (El-Mohtar & Gladstone 36)
about the other\'s opposing world. Their ignorance of any real knowledge
of one another has been fostered by both Agency and Garden\'s \"manic
compulsion to name the Enemy\" (Haraway 9) as entirely Other. When these
early letters speak of infection and infiltration, it is only in binary
terms, each fearing the other is trying to entirely convert or "recruit"
(36) them to the "enemy's" side. However, Red and Blue's letters to one
another move into Cyborg writing once they begin to seek understanding
over conversion. Curiosity and desire drive them to each attempt to
\"say something true\" (37) about themselves to one another. [In this
quest for truth, Red and Blue move past writing in stifling binaries
into the realm of storytelling, each attempting in letters to write
their own origin stories to one another.]{.underline} Haraway also
defined [Cyborg writing as the act of "retelling stories, versions that
reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized
identities."]{.underline} (Cyborg Manifesto 55). From the beginning,
[each origin complicates the binary definitions of what each Cyborg
believes the other to be.]{.underline} Within the binary of their war,
Red's world is one of connection, a species all plugged into one another
where "there is no mono-we, there are many uses \[...\] pieces laid atop
pieces\" (El-Mohtar & Gladstone 43). Red\'s cyborg civilization is
supposed to be the one where the entire human race is in a constant
state of symbiosis. However, the origin story that Red writes for
herself destroys that image of constant connectivity with a tale of
isolation and solitude. Blue's image of Red's world and Red's identity
is that of one massive "artificial god the size of mountains, built for
making war" (64); so Blue is then asked to reimagine her idea of Red as
a small girl who has purposefully walked away from the whole to be "the
only person on that tiny rock." (63). In writing her origin story, Red
not only takes control of how she is observed by Blue, but it also
allows her to subvert the myth of purity that her culture has placed
upon her. Though Red\'s culture is one of vast sameness, in her writing,
she can label herself \"deviant\" (64), as something other than only the
cultural norm enforced upon her by both Blue\'s perceptions and Red\'s
society. Similarly, the origin story Blue writes for herself is of one
not subsumed by the myth of purity that is her culture, that her world
demands one be a part of a greater whole, and though she is "enmeshed in
this wholeness---they are not the whole of me" (72). Blue contrasts
Red's origin by being involuntarily "cut off" (123) from Garden, as
opposed to Red's self-imposed episode of solitude. In the choice to
create and share these origin stories of themselves for each other
through writing, Red and Blue as ["cyborg authors subvert the central
myth" (Haraway 55) of the normative cultures that would keep the
one/other binary intact at all costs.]{.underline} While sharing each
other's origin stories through writing is an act of empowerment and
fusion -- empowering Red and Blue to tell their own stories, and making
their writing a part of each other in the process---Time War goes
further, giving Red and Blue a chance to retell the other\'s origin once
they have told their own. [They can perform this new fusion of entering
each other\'s origin stories through time travel]{.underline}, Blue
becoming the \"something like a wolf\" (63) that Red encounters, saving
her from attackers during her solitude, and Red going back to give the
infection of a \"kiss and something to eat\" (122) that had initially
cut Blue off from her Garden, inoculating her against the poison that
Red\'s Agency will later attempt to use to kill her. Both of these
retellings allow the two Cyborgs to redefine the stories of their
origins from events of barely surviving \"enemy action\" (121) to an
event of being protected by a loved one. Having shared this act of
Cyborg authorship, Red and Blue can no longer continue along the
constraining dualism that their cultures insist upon. As they embrace
each other's writings, each taking the other's story into their own, Red
understands that "it's wrong to call you enemy" (79). It is in the death
of the idea of the enemy that the figure of the Queer Cyborg can finally
be born. Red, having broken the binary holding her back, is allowed to
admit, \"I love you, Blue. Have I always? Haven\'t I?\" (129). If the
Cognitive Cyborg is a Queer Cyborg, as they are in Time War, it\'s the
[breaking down of the dualisms and restrictions inherent in a
heteronormative subjectivity that necessitates that
queerness.]{.underline} [The body and mind under heteronormativity work
to "affirm a structure, to authenticate \[the\] social
order]{.underline}" (Edelman No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive
2-3) [that man/woman is an absolute binary, there are two genders, and
two sides to a single "pure" sexuality]{.underline} (that of
heterosexual couplings), [all of which is subsumed under the politics of
what queer theory labels "reproductive futurism]{.underline}" (3)---[the
idea that the goal of all couplings must be to produce children, that by
"transmit\[ting life\] to the future in the form of its inner Child"
(3), life and romance gain their only meaning. If the goal of Cyborg
writing is political---and all writing is political---then \"Cyborg
politics"]{.underline} (Haraway 59) [is queer politics]{.underline} as
well. In reference to Terry Eagleton's 1990 play Saint Oscar, "[you hold
that a man is a man and a woman is a woman. I hold that nothing is ever
purely itself, and that the point where it becomes so is known as
death]{.underline}" (Eagleton, cf. Heaney 1995, 86-87). These [binaries,
imposed by culture and not nature, can be cast aside by those who reject
the absolute power and authority of such binaries.]{.underline} As Red
and Blue fall in love, Red states, "I want to be a body for you"
(El-Mohtar & Gladstone 129). [The body, as constructed in Cyborg
politics, stands as opposed to the body and its purpose under
heteronormativity. Queer/Cyborg bodies and Queer/Cyborg politics are
bodies of "those not fighting for the children \[but fighting on\] the
side outside the consensus by which all politics confirms the absolute
value of reproductive futurism" (3). The queer Cyborg is free to
"subvert the structures of desire, the force imagined to generate
language and gender"]{.underline} (Haraway 57). The binaries of
man/woman, mother/father, and parent/child are not necessary destinies
for the body of the Cyborg, who is free to seek out other forms of
coupling, and pursue other desires. Or, in Blue's own words: "Sex
improves when decoupled \[...\] from animalistic procreative
desperation" (El-Mohtar & Gladstone 50). Cyborgs\' bodies, unbound from
the "purity" of the human body that is promoted by normativity, and
indeed heteronormativity, do not need to \"dream of community on the
model of the organic \[nuclear, or reproductive\] family\" (Haraway 9).
Though queer couplings of course can have children (and heteronormative
couples who choose not to reproduce are equally valid), and queer
parents are as capable and legitimate as any other parent type,
Edelman's argument is not that queer culture cannot produce children,
but instead that queer culture is one where the end result of love and
couplings does not necessitate children, with love flourishing beyond
the normative demand that reproduction be the end goal of coupling.
[Cyborgs are free to pursue new modes of community and ideas of love
through their altered states of subjectivity, their hybrid status, and
their place as a fusion of different modes of thinking/being. This
Cyborg idea of love is not a separate concept from that of queer
love]{.underline} under Edelman's argument, but is an expression of
queer love[. Cyborg love]{.underline}, as Red and Blue love each other[,
is a love without the motivation of creating future generations, or a
love constrained by the pressure to do so. They do not aim to find
children, or necessarily a place within child-rearing culture, but
instead aim only to find each other, without the ulterior motives or
directives that (hetero)normative culture might demand of them. They do
not dream of procreation, but only of one another.]{.underline} For the
two hybrids of This Is How You Lose the Time War, [the choice to become
that cognitive Queer Cyborg through writing is embraced both as a state
of mind and as a physical manifestation]{.underline}. As Red completes
her apocalyptic transformation, she \"reads Blue into her: tears,
breath, skin \[...\], she builds a model of Blue\'s mind from the words
she left; models her body to the letters\' measure\" (El-Mohtar &
Gladstone 183). Red takes the Cyborg writing of connection and origin
and takes it into herself until \"new organs bloom from autosynthesized
stem cells to shoulder old bits of her away \[...\] a different mind
plays around the edges of her own\" (183). Red becomes a new fusion,
human/machine and human/plant-machine, forsaking all normative concepts
of purity and dualism as she becomes a hybrid that is capable of
crossing back and forth from the post-singularity future of her Agency
to the Mediated Plant future of Blue\'s Garden. Still a Cyborg of
Agency\'s origins, she is rejected by Garden. Nevertheless, no longer
the pure Cyborg of her own culture, she cannot be accepted back. Her
Agency, strictly adhering to the dualism of Us/Them, cannot accept the
queer Cyborg as a creature no longer playing within the rules of
normative dualism. [The queer body of the Cyborg, that which has been
achieved by an apocalyptic shift of subjectivity, cannot exist within
binary culture. A queer culture, a Cyborg culture, is a hybrid of
impurity that must create its own writing and politics, and must write
its own origin story and future, not as a part of \"pure\"
heteronormative culture, or as an option within normativity\'s binaries,
but as something that exists as a new state, as a fusion of
states.]{.underline} As Time War ends, Red and Blue have embraced one
another as hybrids, and so no longer belong to Agency or Garden. They
seek a Cyborg culture all of their own, a ["bridge between our shifts"
(198) that yields to neither.]{.underline} As Blue proposes in their
final letter, the cognitive Cyborg has the power to defect "not to each
other's sides, but to each other" (198). Queer bodies and the hybrid
bodies of Red and Blue can find each other not through the language of
binary or heteronormativity or war, but by forging that new Cyborg
culture through their writing, and through their cognitive states. [When
the queer Cyborg embraces Cyborg writing and embraces the power and
changes and fusions that such writing brings, then the queer body is
free. To quote the final words of This Is How You Lose the Time War, as
the two cognitive cyborgs set out to become those new queer bodies for
one another: \"This is how we win\"]{.underline} (198).

#### We take refuge in hybrid spaces, revel in the forbidden queer life that exists always already in between the lines -- cyborg subjectivity is a process of queer technological assembly and reassembly that transcends the boundaries of normative international politics and identity constructions.

To address that question, I want to turn to [the metaphor of the cyborg
queer]{.underline}, as suggested by the work of Donna Haraway (1991), an
in uential postmodern philosopher of science. The [cyborg is the
creation of science fiction and fantasy, although, as Haraway observes,
science  ction always represents a projection of contemporary cultural
myths]{.underline}. Throughout the modern era, the cyborg has fascinated
the public consciousness, ever since Mary Shelley introduced
Frankenstein's monster, the part-hu- man, part-animal, part-machine who
would be free. [The cyborg is often treated in popular culture as a
monster, or a robot with no autonomy or free will]{.underline}---like
the Borg on Star Trek: the next generation. But this is not always the
case. Haraway finds [in some feminist science fiction novels, and in
films such as Blade Runner, a model for a progressive type of cyborg,
one who is struggling to be free,]{.underline} like Frankenstein's
monster, but [is now living in a postmodern age.]{.underline} In this
form, Haraway suggests, [the cyborg myth is both a reflection of and
constitutive of a new type of human or posthuman subject, no longer
divisible into a 'mind' and a body, and no longer separable from the
technologies that locate it on a worldwide information web and in
cybernetic feedback loops, a cyborg who has carved out limited freedom
in a borderland space.]{.underline} The postmodern cyborg [moves back
and forth across identity borders. The cyborg is a metaphor for
'shapeshifting' subjects who exist at the boundaries and interfaces
between outside and inside, between subjectivity, body, and technology,
able to adapt to a heterogeneous and rapidly changing
environment.]{.underline} They have no authentic unity or identity and
can only be said to exist as partial, always in 'guises', [always in the
process of being assembled and reassembled out of parts circulating on
the worldwide web, always part of a continuous feedback loop that
connects everything in a cybernetic, global information age. In
Haraway's language, the subject is 'stitched together imperfectly' and
always being restitched, without a master plan.]{.underline} If this
[postmodern cyborg]{.underline} is still only a fantasy, only beginning
to be made into reality, Haraway suggests it [is the future for more and
more of 'us'. It is the 'postmodern collective and personal self'
(]{.underline}p. 163). [The education of the cyborg occurs at the
borderlands, that new hybrid space being constructed around the major
national boundaries that divide peoples and cultural identities. This is
the land, she says, of the mestizo, the queer, the
postcolonial]{.underline}. Postmodern cyborg subjects also inhabit a
[cultural landscape in which identities are blurred, multiple languages
are spoken, and different cultural traditions and rituals rub up against
one anothe]{.underline}r. We might take Gloria Anzaldua's writing in her
influential book Borderlands (1987) as an example. For Anzaldua, a
Chicana lesbian, marginalized from the white, middle class women's
movement, marginalized within a patriarchal Mexican culture, and
marginalized as a lesbian in a heteronormative culture, the borderlands
is a permanent place of residence. The geographical borderland Anzaldua
inhabits is that which separates Mexico from the United States, marked
by 'this thin edge of barbwire'. If this barbwire is symbolic of
cultural hegemony and violence, it is a barbwire that does not frighten
some---in fact many---from crossing over or under it every day. Those
who are border crossers learn to shift back and forth from one culture
to the other, speaking in diverse tongues, surviving by interweaving and
juxtaposing ideas, literary forms, linguistic styles, and identities[.
Who now lives in the borderlands? The 'prohibited' and the 'forbidden'
find it their home. In short: 'the squint-eyed, the perverse, the queer,
the troublesome, the mongrel, the mulato, the half-breed, the half
dead'.]{.underline} This is [a territory, in short, for those who 'cross
over, pass over, or go through the con nes of the "normal" ' (p. 25).
Cyborgs and mestizos are metaphors for a new form of postmodern subject
who no longer, according to Haraway, is caught in the 'spiral dance', no
longer needs an Other to define itself.]{.underline} Haraway borrows a
phrase from the Vietnamese film maker and postcolonial theorist Trinh T.
Minha-ha---'inappropriate/d others'---to refer to [the cyborg subject
who does not engage in self-definition through reference to dominant
categories of 'self' and 'Other,']{.underline} the kinds of identities
offered to the late modern subject by identity politics. To the extent
that cyborgs define themselves by identity labels it is always for
strategic purposes. Politically, [cyborgs prefer a politics of personal
communicative freedom and strategic political mobilizations to a
politics of welfare state progressivism and reformism, forms of politics
that allow cyborgs to 'join with another, to see together without
claiming to be another' (]{.underline}Haraway, 1991, p. 193). Rather
than view gender, class, race, and sexual identities as the basis for a
progressive politics, Haraway and other postmodern feminists seek to
liberate us from the taken-for-granted character of identity categories.
[The cyborg subject is not accustomed to thinking about 'race' or
'gender' or 'class' or 'sexual orientation' as if these were naturally
given and meaningful categories. In the subversion of identity in the
new borderlands of culture, Haraway sees the possibility for weaving
together a new hybrid identity]{.underline}, linked to a new affinity
politics that draws people together based on common interest and
lifestyle and that dissolves again when it is no longer useful. Affinity
politics is the only kind of politics that makes sense in a postmodern
world, according to Haraway, in which ['none of "us" have any longer the
symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape of reality to any
of "them" ']{.underline} (p. 157). This all sounds very appealing and
very liberating---to cast off the mask and shield of identity, to be
free agents at last, engaged in constructing and reconstructing
ourselves outside of the binary logic of dominant identity categories.
Yet I remain somewhat suspicious of postmodern identity formation. We
may live in a world in which borders are increasingly meaningless, and
in which all identity is understood to be performance and
representation. The worldwide information web and the global village may
also now provide opportunities to build new kinds of  uid, af nity-group
communities and shapeshifting identities. [At the same time, we cannot
walk away from the historic struggles over power that still define
class, race, gender, and sexual identity in the postmodern
world.]{.underline} We are participants, wittingly or unwittingly, in
historic struggles against oppression and invisibility, and to suggest
that these 'old' modern era struggles are no longer relevant, that we
are now free, if we want to be, to creatively engage in our own
self-production outside of identity, outside of the dialectic between
self and Other, is to engage in a fantasy we should not mistake for
reality. In an essay on 'The "Uncanny"', Sigmund Freud tells a story
about riding on a train, half-asleep in his compartment, when suddenly
he was jolted awake as the washing-cabi- net door across from him swung
open. As he sat up, Freud writes, 'an elderly gentleman in a
dressing-gown and a traveling cap came in'. Freud assumed that the man
had taken the wrong direction and come into his compartment by mistake.
'Jumping up with the intention of putting him right, I at once realized
to my dismay that the intruder was nothing but my own re ection in the
looking-glass on the open door.' What was uncanny about the situation,
he observes, is that 'I can still recollect that I thoroughly disliked
his appearance' (Freud, 1958, p. 248). Freud provides, in this brief
example, a representation of the myth of the 'double'; a myth based on
the metaphor of the looking-glass self. The Other is an exteriorization
of our own subjectivity, a construction of our own ego, a projection of
part of ourselves we would deny, exclude, and repress. So Freud projects
upon the Other in the mirror a dislikeable appearance, af rming his own
likeability. But he also means to imply that his own self-likeability is
constructed on shaky ground, that it is dependent upon the
dislikeability of the man in the mirror. Yet the man in the mirror is a
re ection of himself. We cannot but fail to see ourselves in the
negativity of the Other we have created. To bring issues of identity
into education is to help young people recognize that the degree to
which the Other has been represented as a 'double', an alter ego re
ected in the mirror. Hegel and Marx, of course, based a whole narrative
of history on the dialectic between self and Other, making it the
driving force of history. From this standpoint, identity is constructed
out of the relationship between master and slave, between independent
and dependent consciousness. The destination of history is the
recognition that we no longer need these identity categories to de ne
ourselves, so that difference dissolves and truth is once more uni ed.
This modernist mythology of history has been pretty well discredited in
recent years, both because of its utopianism and because the promise of
unity is itself inconsistent with commitments to difference and
diversity. But postmodern theory may offer only the negativity of this
modern myth, rather than a transformative new mythology. Whereas
modernism understands identity as requiring an Other, postmodern
identity seeks to de ne itself without the need for 'Othering'
practices. Whereas modern forms of identity formation emphasize a
movement towards the unity of all oppositions, postmodern identity
formation offers only a movement towards the dispersal of all unities, a
proliferation of differences that never comes together in any coherent
cultural politics. I think one way to proceed is down a path suggested
by Judith Butler (1999). As a leading postmodern theorist of the self,
Butler understands identity as performance and believes that a
progressive cultural politics is about troubling all essentialistic
treatments of identity. This seems to imply a cultural politics that is
organized around af nity groups rather than fixed and unidimensional
identity groups. For to organize around identity is to participate in
legitimating identity categories, even though these categories have
served to oppress women, people of colour, gays and lesbians, and the
'working class'. Still, Butler backs away from this extreme,
post-identity position. She is Hegelian enough to believe that identity
in Western culture has been and continues to be a dialectical
production. Within the historical dialectic between dominant and
subordinated groups, identity categories are more than categories of
oppression. They are also categories used in the slave's struggle for
freedom. At this historical juncture at least, she writes, [the subject
requires an identity forged out of 'a radical and constitutive relation
to alterity'.]{.underline} This means that there are limits to the idea
of moving beyond identity, at least as 'the point of departure for
politics' (p. xiv). At the same time, identity is never  xed or
unidimensional. Various identity dialectics push the human subject
towards continuous reconstruction. Butler observes that the self
constantly  nds itself outside itself, without the possibility of a
'return to a former self'. No return is possible because there is no
recovery from 'self-loss', the losing of who we have been, the lack of a
stable foundation upon which to construct a stable identity (p. xv). The
subject is always recognizing itself through identity. But the moment it
nds itself is simultaneously the moment it begins to lose itself again,
as identity is revealed as a mere representation, a performance, a re
ection in the mirror. The moment that identity is used subversively, to
afrm a liberatory politics, is also the moment it begins to be
commercialized and stripped of its liberatory politics. Where does this
leave progressive educators, scholars, and cultural workers? I think it
leaves us trying to reconcile identity politics and post-identity
politics rather than choosing one over the other. It means learning to
afrm identity and troubling it simultaneously. For although identity may
still be constructed as a relation between self and Other, the current
categories of identity are not permanent fixtures on the cultural
landscape, and self and Other can move toward a more equitable
recognition. Given all this, it seems likely that sexual identity, along
with gender, race, and class identities, will continue to play a part in
constructing the postmodern self. Indeed, for all the talk about queer
theory as a movement beyond identity, it may be appreciated as a new
stage in an historic movement characterized by a heightened
self-awareness regarding identities that were once largely taken for
granted as naturally given. In some ways, gayness is even more rmly
established as an axis of identity formation in the postmodern age,
although its name and form keep changing. And lesbians and gay men,
along with bisexual and transgendered people, are coming out, and thus
afrming an identity, at a younger and younger age. One example of just
how much things are changing is an event that took place in 1998, at a
middle school in Falls Church, Virginia. David Grossman, the 13-year-old
guest of honour, held a coming-out party one day after school, proudly
af rming a gay identity before family and other gay teens (Steiner,
2001). If David's story is not typical, it suggests that sexual identity
is not going away, that gay/queer identity still serves a very important
role in helping most homosexual and bisexual young people af rm their
bodies and their desires, and also build an identity that is more than
about sexuality, that involves solidarity with others and commitment to
a cultural politics. At the same time, gay youth are still coming out
into the margins, and the struggle against the commodi cation of sexual
identity continues. Although the cyborg queer is a useful metaphor for a
new phase in the conscious development of sexual identity at the
margins, it is fraught with contradictions. The cyborg is a creature of
the global web, the internet, and as we move into what Jean Baudrilliard
(1983) has called a 'hyperreal' world, identity is increasingly
hyperreal or virtual as well. We stitch a self-image together by cutting
and pasting images and texts, by creating multiple personae. Virtual
communities of identity replace 'real', geographical communities. Eugene
Provenzo (1998) observes that these developments are for the most part
progressive, that the worldwide web can provide a liberatory space for
gay youth outside of the regulatory and normalizing power of the local
community. The internet allows gay youth across America, even in remote
rural areas, to participate in gay culture and build communities of af
nity. But how liberatory, how politically aware, are these new virtual
communities that we spend so much time inhabiting? As Darren Pascavage
argues, 'the Internet can quite literally keep gay youth "in their
place"--- speci cally, in front of the computer' (2000, p. 9). And that
place, as he notes, is increasingly commercialized. This means that the
struggle over control of identity continues, as does the marginalization
of gayness. The homecoming parade  oat sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian,
and Bisexual Alliance at Miami University which I referred to at the
beginning of this essay was performing queer identity in the belly of
the beast, one might say. But it was a performance that still kept
gayness in its place, isolated to one  oat. The  oat signi ed that there
is now a limited space for gayness, so long as that space is still a
separate space, so long as gay people continue to be the Other. In such
a context, [one must af rm identity and trouble it simultaneously,
constructing and reconstructing self and Other in the
process.]{.underline}

#### The politics of the cyborg is a form of queer digital experimentation that affirms the ontological instability of queer life -- we appropriate and reconstruct the technologies of modernity in order to transgress biopolitical boundaries of gender and sexuality and generate new worlds of possibility.

For many in the field, the idea of [queer method will always sound hope-
lessly discordant - an awkward codification of a deliberately unstable
and ontologically interdisciplinary discourse.]{.underline} If academic
method describes a procedure, a codification of disciplinarily grounded
rules, then we might imagine that [queer thought would thrive mostly
through provocation and deconstruction, not the building of a new
canon]{.underline}. Indeed, to the limited extent queer method has been
articulated, it has typically been to bring queer theory to method -
subjecting the epistemological assumptions of fieldwork and textual
analysis to critical scrutiny. While this tendency to mobilize queerness
as a critical verb preserves maximum theoretical malleability while
usefully complicating the assumptions of academic systemization, there
is a limit to the political efficacy of queering existing methodologies.
Of course there will never be a queer method, but [the time has come to
shift: from queering methods to experimentally using methods to more
widely distribute queer politics, sociality, and
sensibility.]{.underline} My focus here is encouraging [queer digital
experimentation in the practices of the everyday by appropriating,
hacking, and even construct- ing networks of social, corporeal, and
environmental sensors.]{.underline} While I\'m not arguing that the
built architectures of sensing and tracking data - networked, embodied
devices like the Fitbit, ambient environmental sensors like Nest, or the
oedipally named, versatile sensors of Mother by Sen.se - are queer, [the
increasingly pervasive underlying technology pro- vides possibilities
for distributing a queer politics of ontological intercon- nection and
indeterminacy]{.underline}. This sense of possibility, however, [rests
on an uncomfortable resonance between data capitalism and queer ontology
that requires a critically engaged and reflexive
methodology.]{.underline} Reaching into the beyond of biopolitics
(Clough and Willse 2011), I look at capitalism and digital media after
\"the normal.\" As queer theo- rists continue to debate the value of
critical orientations to normativity (Wiegman and Wilson 2015;
Halberstam 2015), I explore [the emergent postnormative, where the
modulation and capitalization of bodies and populations rests less on
broad cultural and technical averaging.]{.underline} In sug- gesting
this realignment of queer attention, [I do not discount the strik- ing
persistence of wildly inequitable distributions of violence and death
through the calcified norms of sexual, racial, classed, and otherwise
corpo- really marked social violenc]{.underline}e. Rather, I hope to
[galvanize queer critical ca- pacity toward new forms of sociocorporeal
modulation and classification and encourage experimentation with those
quantitative and digital meth- ods]{.underline} typically dismissed or
ignored by queer theorists. By foregrounding queer experimentation with
digital methods, I look to balance an oppo- sitional epistemology with
[the more active development of \"transgressed boundaries, potent
fusions, and dangerous possibilities]{.underline}\" (Haraway 1990, 154).
[How might we create new open-ended circuits using emergent tech-
nologies to proliferate forms of relationality and bring queer notions
of ontological indeterminacy and interconnection into consciousness?
While the notion of using digitally processed quantitative data to pro-
mote a queer indeterminacy might sound counterintuitive to some, it is a
strategy that reflects the intensified biopolitical modulation that
defines our age.]{.underline} While submitting \"our\" data to networks
gives us free (Facebook) or subsidized (23andMe1) products, we rarely
have access to these pref- erences, traces, or bodily processes.
Therefore, while this networked data gets used by corporate entities to
serve us ads or design our drugs, we are blocked from reimagining its
social utility except in highly circumscribed conditions.2 In part, I\'m
advocating for queer theory to take a hard look at the quan- titative
methodologies of what Nigel Thrift calls \"knowing capitalism,\" the
increasingly big business of studying and modulating the everyday
(2005). Notably, the [first stop of capitalisms \"micro-sociological
turn\" (]{.underline}Thrift 2012, 148) [is sex and
relationality]{.underline}. Social connection is an almost unfath-
omably massive enterprise, and companies like Facebook, Twitter - and a
million upstarts - have a voracious appetite for difference. Its worth
bald- ly stating: [these are sociological companies with a narrowly
instrumen- tal focus involved in not just knowing but actively
modulating social life.]{.underline} And as I have argued elsewhere,
companies like Facebook have monetized queer notions of sociality: the
mutability of identity through the event and over time, the centrality
of nonfamilial community in the understanding of the self, the
celebration of recognition and visibility as core strategies of
political engagement, and the interest in the nontextual, performative,
and ephemeral (Haber 2016). Robert Payne has similarly suggested [a
queer modality of network culture that promotes a \"multiplication and
com- plication of intimate relations, the promiscuous commingling of
self and other, self with self, user with interface, public with
private, individual with social, and leisure with labor]{.underline}\"
(2014, 2). While these are infrastructures that many are already
familiar with, [more intriguing and concerning for me are still-emergent
computational systems that attempt to build on the randomness-inflected
development of life itself - circuitry that strives toward the
complexity and plasticity of neural systems in the brain]{.underline}.
There are even suggestions that [biodigital sys- tems will increasingly
try to harness the \"realm of extension and thought at the inanimate
level\"]{.underline} (Parisi 2012, 45), to try, in other words, [to
monetize the indeterminacy and potentiality at the heart of all
matter]{.underline}. In short, while I am arguing that [queer theorists
should take advantage of the indetermi- nate potential of digital
networks, we must also sharpen our critical voices, as capitalism is
increasingly able to profit through an alignment with queer ontologies
of sociality, embodiment, and materiality. Queer method]{.underline}
must be a witness to violence, and it [must be performa- tively involved
in the creation of new worlds]{.underline}. Knowing capitalism - much
like the genealogy of queer indeterminacy I draw from - is increasingly
concerned with the above and below of consciousness, the strange and
monstrous assemblages that bypass our phenomenological experience of
Cartesian boundaries. I draw connections between [queer writing about
materiality and biological systems with technoscientific investments
also inspired by the indeterminacy of life and matter]{.underline}. I
also look to blur and break down boundaries between queer and feminist
theory, a split that has been hopelessly overdetermined. This is not to
say that queer theory and feminist theory are the same, or that they
always get along, but that there have been important crosscurrents of
continuity in rejecting a determined body, subject, and form of
relationality. I then highlight recent theoretical engagement with the
work of Alfred North Whitehead by media scholar Mark Hansen, as perhaps
offering a vision of this queer methodological potential, and I end with
a discussion of the politics of queer method. With the ascendancy of a
conservative LGBT agenda, including the nationalization of
gender-neutral marriage law and impending changes to military rules
allowing trans-identified folks to serve openly (Cooper 2016; Schaefer
et al. 2016), queer ideas and queer politics have never been more
needed, and methodological in- vention is key here as well. While
corporate-owned social networks are solidifying their hold on the
distribution of ideas, we are asked to believe assurances from Facebook
s social scientists that the movement of media across their proprietary
networks has more to do with \"individual choice\" than algorithmic
predestination (Bakshy, Messing, and Adamie 2015). [An active
experimentation with the forms and formulas of digital media, espe-
cially as it increasingly colonizes the depths of the body, is perhaps
the key challenge of queer politics in the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}

#### Our praxis takes shape in the dissonant gaps of normative international relations -- the 1AC destabilizes the monolithic signification of cisheteronormativity that the resolution's political project relies on.

**Weber '14** \-- Professor of International Relations at the University
of Sussex (Cynthia Weber, 2014, "From Queer to Queer IR," Queer
International Relations, International Studied Review (2014), 16,

What is queer? Why are queer international theories relevant to
international relations? What might queer investigations of
international relations look like? While debates about the meaning of
the term "queer" and whether or not queer can be or ought to be defined
rage on (Butler 1994; Warner 2012; Wilcox, this forum), many
self-identified queer scholars cite Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's description
of queer as their point of departure. Sedgwick suggested [that queer
designates "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances
and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent
elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's sexuality aren't made (or can't
be made) to signify monolithically"]{.underline} (1993:8).2 Sedgwick's
exposition of queer makes clear the affinities queer studies has to
feminist studies and gender studies---with their analyses of the
political work that gender, sex, and (sometimes) sexuality do---and to
poststructuralist studies---with their analyses of the political work
that multiple significations do. Yet queer studies is neither reducible
to feminist studies, gender studies, or poststructuralist studies. Nor
is it the sum total of these theoretical dispositions. As an academic
practice, [queer studies has been and remains, as Teresa de Lauretis
described it, an attempt "to rethink the sexual in new ways, elsewhere
and otherwise"]{.underline} in relation to but also beyond traditional
Gay and Lesbian Studies, Feminist and Gender Studies, and
Poststructuralist Studies (De Lauretis 1991:xvi; Rubin 1992; Butler
1990). The "elsewhere" of queer studies about which de Lauretis writes
has generally functioned to locate queer international theories outside
of the discipline of International Relations (IR), largely because
[queer has been regarded as "otherwise" to what most IR scholars have
been schooled to understand as international relations theory and
practice]{.underline} (Weber 2014a). While the advantages and
disadvantages of categorizing queer international theories as "elsewhere
and other-wise" to a broader body of work called IR theory are still
hotly debated in the discipline (Weber 2014b), there is a [growing
recognition among many IR scholars that the distinction between
international relations theories and queer international theories upon
which such debates rely is unsustainable.]{.underline} This is for at
least four reasons. The first reason has to do with what queer studies
and queer international theories are and do. [Queer studies and queer
international theories primarily investigate how queer subjectivities
and queer practices---the "who" and the "how" that cannot or will not be
made to signify monolithically in relation to gender, sex, and/or
sexuality---are disciplined, normalized, or capitalized
upon]{.underline} by and for states, NGOs, and international
corporations[.]{.underline} And they [investigate how state and nonstate
practices of disciplinization, normalization, and capitalization might
be critiqued and resisted]{.underline} (Weber 1994a,b, 1999; Duggan
2003; Puar 2007). This is precisely what Foucauldian-informed
international relations scholarship does, albeit usually without an
explicit focus on nonmonolithic genders, sexes, and sexualities. Second,
why [a focus on nonmonolithic genders, sexes, and sexualities matters
for the discipline of international relations is in part because states
and states' leaders in particular have made it a focus of their domestic
and foreign policies.]{.underline} How [states,]{.underline} for
example, [answer questions about the normality or perversion of "the
homosexual" and "the queer" and how these two figures are related to one
another currently influences how some states make domestic and foreign
policy.]{.underline} For example, claims made by Putin's Russia and
Museveni's Uganda that "the homosexual" and "the queer" are perverse led
each country to formulate domestic policies that were to varying degrees
punished by some states and international organizations (Rao 2010, 2012,
2014; Weiss and Bosia 2013). In contrast, the Obama administration's
figuration of "the homosexual" but not "the queer" as normal led it to
champion "gay rights as human rights" as part of its foreign policy
(Clinton 2011), a general and specific foreign-policy position that
queer scholars critique (Duggan 2003; Puar 2007, 2010; Wilkinson and
Langlois 2014). Third, [queer international theories explicitly engage
with what many IR scholars regard as the discipline's governing
dichotomy---order versus anarchy.]{.underline} Among the ways the "order
vs. anarchy" dichotomy functions (and, importantly, fails to function)
in international relations is by articulating "order vs. anarchy" [as
"normal vs. perverse" and, more specifically, as "hetero/homo-normative
vs. queer"---which is one of the dichotomies that queer theorists
investigate and resist. When an order vs. anarchy dichotomy is
constituted and sustained by a hetero/homo-normative vs. queer dichotomy
in international practice]{.underline} (as it is in the above examples
regarding Russia, Uganda, and the United States), [any distinction
between a general IR and a specific so-called Queer IR
disappears.]{.underline} For investigating how these dichotomies
function is (or ought to be) of central concern to both queer
international theorists and IR theorists more generally. Finally, [the
breadth of Queer IR investigations now extends to what are arguably the
three core domains in which IR scholars claim expertise---war and peace,
international political economy, and state and nation
formation.3]{.underline} What this discussion suggests is that there is
no definitive distinction between something called IR and something
called Queer IR. Having said that, though, it is important not to lose
site of the unique, critical difference "queer" makes--- ontologically,
epistemologically, and methodologically---to investigations of
international relations theory and practice. Ontologically, [Queer IR
scholars focus on queer ontologies that do not or cannot be made to
signify monolithically]{.underline}. These include trans\*, inter,
cross, and pan gendered, sexed, and sexualized bodies---be they
physical, geographical, political, historical, economic, ideological, or
other.4 These [queerly figured bodies are often analyzed
intersectionally through and in relation to figurations of race, age,
ability, and class]{.underline} (for example, Nash 2008).
Epistemologically, [Queer IR scholars recognize that knowledge and
ignorance in and about international relations are intricately bound up
with sexual knowledge and sexual ignorance.]{.underline} This was
Sedgwick's general conclusion, based upon her observation that
twentieth-century Western culture depends upon knowing who and/or what
it means to be homosexual---because the heterosexual/homosexual
dichotomy supports so many other meaningful distinctions. Sedgwick's
list of meaningful distinctions includes public/private,
domestic/foreign, discipline/ terrorism, secrecy/disclosure,
natural/artificial, wholeness/decadence, and knowledge/ignorance
(1990:11). When critically employed, these matrices of knowing and/or
not knowing allow us to reconsider not only a variety of
heterosexual/homosexual dichotomies but also a variety of
cis-gender/trans\* dichotomies. In light of Lisa Duggan's observations
about how homonormativity functions in twenty-first-century Western
culture---as "a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative
assumptions and institutions, but upholds and sustains them, while
promising the possibility of a demobilized gay constituency and a
privatized, depoliticized gay culture anchored in domesticity and
consumption" (Duggan 2003:50; also see Duggan 2002)---contemporary Queer
IR scholars recognize how various [homonormative/homodeviant dichotomies
increasingly are used to make sense of and to order intimate, national,
and international relations.]{.underline} Informed by such queer
epistemologies, [Queer IR scholars employ methodologies]{.underline}
that (like poststructuralist methodologies) [do not seek to uncover "the
truth" of sexed, gendered, and sexualized bodies, assemblages,
institutions, and orders]{.underline} (Foucault 1979). For in what I
call a queer logic of the and/or,5 such "[truths" are never stable and
their representation is never guaranteed; therefore, any attempt to
represent them as if they were stable is understood as a political
act.]{.underline} For this reason, Queer IR scholars instead track when
[queer figurations emerge and how they are normalized and/or perverted
so that they might challenge but also support]{.underline} heterosexual,
heteronormative, cis-gendered, homonormative, homophobic, and
trans\*phobic [assumptions, orders, and institutions.]{.underline} The
[resulting "deviant knowledges" of international relations these
methodologies produce can disorient Disciplinary IR
knowledges]{.underline} not only about queer subjects (Ahmed 2006) but
also about international relations subjects and the discipline of IR as
a subject. What research themes and questions follow from queer
understandings of international relations? I would suggest that there
are at least (but not exclusively) three, often overlapping, indicative
sets of research questions that Queer IR scholars have been and are
generating. The first set of research themes explores how "queer" and
"queering" are mobilized in international relations theory and practice.
These questions often investigate how [queer and queering challenge "the
normalizing mechanisms of state power to name its sexual subjects: male
and female, married or single, heterosexual or homosexual, natural or
perverse"]{.underline} (Eng, Halberstam, and Munoz \~ 2005:1) in
intimate, national, and international relations. This has led queer
international theorists to consider: • [Which figurations in/of
international relations do not and cannot be made to signify
monolithically in terms of gender, sex, and sexuality,]{.underline} and
how [research focused on these queer figures might make it possible to
think and to do international relations differently]{.underline} (Weber
forthcoming); • How [queer(ing) nations, states, sovereignties, and
empires affects international theory and practice]{.underline} (Weber
1998a, 1999; Peterson 1999, 2013, this forum; Agathangelou et al. 2008);
• How queer(ing) the intimate relations of family and households queers
the international (Peterson 2010a,b, this forum); • How queer[(ing)
mainstream IR theories like the "territorial peace" potentially
rearticulates what the discipline of IR is and can be]{.underline}
(Sjoberg, this forum; and more generally, see Wilcox, this forum; Nayak,
this forum); and • How [queer(ing) borders (Sjoberg, this forum) and
movement across borders by queer subjects]{.underline} (Fortier 2002;
Gopinath 2005; Luibheid 2005, 2008; Arondekar and Patel forthcoming)
might [unanchor international relations from its obsession with
sovereign nation-state]{.underline}s as its relatively fixed object of
study. This first batch of themes might give the impression that the
queer (and Queer IR) research questions queer(ing) generates are always
transgressive and transformative. This is not the case. Indeed, to
reduce queer and/or Queer IR to some heroic championing of an always
already dissident figuration is to overlook how "queer" is mobilized to
constitute and preserve various hegemonic imaginaries of sex, gender,
and sexuality and the powerful assumptions, orders, and institutions
they support. It is, therefore, vital to pose a second set of Queer IR
research themes and questions that take account of how "queer" is
sometimes claimed in the name of normalizing and depoliticizing
understandings of sex, gender, and sexuality rather than contesting
them. Research questions that explore these dimensions of queer often
investigate how [the nonmonolithic character of queer signification---a
queer logic of "and/or"---is appropriated by hegemonic actors,
alliances, and orders as a national and international strategy of
governance through securitization and marketization.]{.underline} How,
for example, do states, [international alliances, international orders,
and international institutions present themselves as: Simultaneously
straight and/or queer, as I argue the United States (US) performs its
hegemonic masculinity]{.underline} in relation to the Caribbean (Weber
1998a, 1999); • [Simultaneously politicizing and/or
depoliticizing]{.underline}, as Duggan's account of how homonormativies
sustain a plethora of depoliticizing neoliberal institutions and aims in
the name of a selective politics of inclusion suggests (2003); •
Simultaneously exceptionally tolerant and/or intolerant of LGBTQ
populations, often in the form of policies that praise so-called modern
[states for their tolerance as a way to further abject as intolerant and
intolerable so-called traditional populations]{.underline}, as Puar
(2007), Kuntsman (2009), Schulman (2012), and Remkus Britt (forthcoming)
argue supports Israeli policies of occupying Palestinian territories; •
Simultaneously pro-LGBTQ and/or anti-LGBTQ, as Lind and Keating argue is
the case with present-day Ecuadorian state policy (Lind and Keating
2013; Lind, this forum); • Simultaneously protective of LGBT citizenship
rights and/or dangerous to these same citizens because of the specific
ways LGBTQ citizens are incorporated by states, as Haritaworn, Kuntsman,
and Posocco argue through their analysis of how "queer necropolitics"
functions (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and Posocco 2013b)? In so doing, these
scholars have generated a range of useful concepts and ideas that enable
a rethinking of specific aspects of international theory and practice,
including how actors, orders, institutions, and alliances are formed
through and sustained by "queer compensatory strategies" (Weber 1999),
"homonormativities" (Duggan 2003), "pinkwashing" (Puar 2007),
"homonationalisms" (Puar 2007), "homoprotectionism" (Lind and Keating
2013), and "murderous inclusions" (Haritaworn et al. 2013b). These
analyses have also led to speculation on what kinds of "queer protest"
and "queer protesters" might be the most effective in challenging
conservative mobilizations of queer (Rao 2010; Duggan and Kim
2011--2012). Finally, a third set of themes and questions generated by
Queer IR scholars and scholarship considers what being a Queer IR
scholar and doing Queer IR scholarship does specifically in and to the
discipline of international relations, especially Disciplinary IR. For
example: • How do disciplinary strategies like shunning on the one hand
and the "gentrification" of Queer IR research on the other give the
impression that "there is no queer international theory?" (Weber
2014a,b); • As LGBTQ issues become significantly more visible in foreign
policy, might it be at the discipline's peril to erase Queer IR scholars
and scholarship and to relinquish their domains of analysis to other
(inter)- disciplines like Global Queer Studies? • Could acknowledgment
of Queer IR scholarship broaden and deepen understandings of what
Disciplinary IR claims as its three core domains of research excellence:
state and nation formation, war and peace, and international political
economy? • Might such analyses generate a novel range of theoretical
insights that are primarily informed by both queer theory and
international relations theory, particularly because both of these
theoretical perspectives have so much to say about (in)securities? • If
so, should Queer IR scholars enter into a proper institutional alliance
with Disciplinary IR---into a "gay marriage" of sorts---with (in)
security functioning as their axis of sameness/similarity? • Would this
"queer the discipline of IR"? Is "queering the discipline of IR"
possible? Or would the discipline of IR never accept a theory that
"elevates perversion to philosophy"?6 As this discussion suggests,
[queer theorizations of international relations exist, they are relevant
to core international relations questions and topics,]{.underline} and
they have long been [generating robust international relations research
programs]{.underline}. The contributions to this forum evidence and
further these research programs, making clear the critical difference
queer can make for international theorizing.

#### Debate is a site of social formation -- we retool the pedagogical processes of this space in service of reparative queer kinship that forms enduring bonds of solidarity and care within an environment of paranoid antagonism.

**Ensor 17** (Sarah Ensor, English Language and Literature,
Ecocriticism, gender and sexuality, JUNE 01 2017, "Relative Strangers:
Contracting Kinship in the Queer Ecology Classroom,"

If this model of contracting kinship requires acknowledging our
corporeal vulnerability, then it seems necessary to acknowledge, too,
that this year in particular (2016) has made us viscerally aware of
bodies at risk. [Among the many sources of exposure that we continue to
face is the changing climate of higher education, whose current
condition makes it easy to believe that optimism in (or, indeed, about)
academia is naive at best and actively harmful at worst.]{.underline}
But **[with[in]{.mark} [an]{.mark} [environment that fosters
paranoia]{.mark}, [pedagogical kinship]{.mark} may not only become
legible through a reparative reading practice but also may [be a
powerfully]{.mark} [reparative social formation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
For [such a model [enables]{.mark} a form of [care]{.mark} that is
[embodied and improvisational]{.mark}, responsive to and inspired by the
way in which vulnerability and community, contingency and possibility
(for teachers and students, as for matsutake21) so often are
intertwined.]{.underline} [Although administrations increasingly hope
that teachers' and students' relationships to the university---and to
each other---will be contractual]{.underline}, the fact remains that our
[contracting takes place not only in the legal but also in the bodily
sense.]{.underline} As opposed to being a means of
institutionalization---of the [standardization of relationships, the
reproduction of existing values (and forms of privilege),22 and the kind
of conservative resemblance among past, present, and future that often
characterizes both kinship structures and higher
education]{.underline}---this model of [pedagogy is characterized by
provisionality, surprise, and spread]{.underline}. **[The
[classroom]{.mark} [exceeds]{.mark} the increasingly [corporatized
institution]{.mark} at the same time that [it is housed within]{.mark}
(and inseparable from) it, [calling to mind]{.mark} the subtly spatial
logic of [reparative reading]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Pedagogical modes
of kinship thus come to resemble the "plethora of only loosely related
weak theories," brimming with "tenderness, wit, inventive reading,
obiter dicta, and writerly panache," that, in Sedgwick's (2003, 136, my
emphasis) account, are "invited to shelter" within the strong paranoid
theory of a book like D. A. Miller's The Novel and the Police. Indeed,
as Sedgwick repeatedly insists, the reparative posture (with its forms
of care) is structurally inseparable both from paranoia itself and from
the Kleinian depressive position---and thus is responsive to, not
avoidant of, fear and harm. But "its fear, a realistic one, is that the
culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture"; as a
result, "it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that
will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self" (149, my
emphasis). The ethical possibility of caring for others "is founded on
and coextensive with the . . . very often fragile concern to provide the
self with pleasure and nourishment in an environment that is perceived
as not particularly offering them" (137). [Perhaps an institution such
as mine is precisely the proper site for such an experiment in care.
**Unlike on traditional campuses**]{.underline}, where students more
often than not are following an expected trajectory (high school to
college to employment), my students already have [considerable
experience with the "deroutinized temporality" (and openness to
surprise) that Sedgwick (148) deems foundational to the reparative
gesture]{.underline}. [And unlike on traditional campuses, where
students in any given classroom find themselves already sharing
considerable common ground]{.underline}---from age range to family
background, from spirit for the school's football team to fraternity
affiliation---my [students are strangers]{.underline} to each other in a
much more fundamental way. They are [veterans of Desert Storm, Iraq, and
Afghanistan, who sit facing the door to preclude being startled and who
miss class for appointments at the VA Hospital. They are parents and
grandparents who put younger generations through school before deciding
to return themselves. They are twenty- and thirty-somethings who are
being priced out of their hometown, for whom our city's rapid
gentrification and booming housing market are not fodder for abstract
debate but rather embodied realities lived on a daily
basis.]{.underline} They are adults who have had entire careers as
reporters, social workers, and administrative assistants, who have found
themselves on our campus after losing their jobs or deciding to change
course. For those who are closer to traditional college age, my
institution is hardly ever their first stop. Graduates of community
colleges or students whose initial foray into higher education ended in
abandonment of one form or another, they have found their way to our
campus in the wake of other experiences of learning, often ones that did
not lead where they planned. Like Sedgwick, [they have long been
"attune\[d\] . . . to a heartbeat of contingency" (147). Like Tsing's
subjects, they inhabit "salvage rhythms]{.underline}" (2015, 132). As
with my pedagogy, their paths have already gone astray. Ultimately,
**[their [status as]{.mark} college [students]{.mark} [does not
indicate]{.mark} any kind of [elite escapism]{.mark} from the world's
patterns of circulation [but]{.mark} rather a [different mode of
participating]{.mark} in---and being affected
by---them]{.underline}**.23 [When such students (and I) become kin,
then, the result is neither flat likeness nor any kind of codified bond.
The aim is not for those who find themselves in my class to choose each
other as lifelong friends (although sometimes they do) or for our
kinship to be an institution that rivals (or even provides an
alternative to) the broader university that houses us.]{.underline}
Instead, **[[we respond to]{.mark} the [ongoing damage of the past
and]{.mark} the [emerging damage of the present]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
immanent [gestures of community that help us move together]{.mark},
uncertainly, [toward]{.mark} [uncertain futures]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Our **[[kinship]{.mark}---like the reparative posture---[fosters]{.mark}
a "[position from which]{.mark} [it is possible]{.mark} . . .
[to]{.mark} use one's own resources to assemble or '[repair']{.mark} the
[murderous part-objects into something like a
whole]{.mark}]{.underline}**---though . . . **[[not]{.mark} necessarily
[like any preexisting whole]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Sedgwick 2003,
128). [Invested in hope without naïveté, in a mode of repairing that is
[not the same as healing or absolving]{.mark}, such practices evince
care precisely in the absence of durability and optimism precisely in
the absence of guarantees]{.underline}. [In improvisational,
unpredictable, and steadfastly material ways, through our own local
practices and "nonce taxonomies" (145), we seek to make things better
not only for each other but also for the community that accrues at the
thresholds of our urban university's porous bounds]{.underline}. [[We
reckon with]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark} in which [higher education has
abandoned us without]{.mark} ourselves [abandoning
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Eventually]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[we]{.mark} do [walk away from the classroom]{.mark},]{.underline}**
a fact that might foreground the interplay of provisionality and
endurance in this model of care. For **[[the resulting]{.mark}
marks---the [imprint]{.mark}---[may be permanent even if]{.mark} the
[relationships]{.mark} themselves [are not enacted again]{.mark} in the
future (and perhaps cannot be replicated outside the social milieu of
the classroom).]{.underline}** As the texts on our syllabus reminded us,
**[fleeting interactions can have enduring effects]{.underline}**. For
instance, Dean, writing about the forms of consanguineous kinship
developed via (voluntary) infection with HIV, insists that [the
encounters responsible for transmission queerly resemble marriage,
insofar as they involve a lifelong commitment]{.underline} (to one's own
body, if not to the often-multiply anonymous body that infects one).
These encounters, then, are "as far from casual . . . as one can get"
(Dean 2009, 85); **[[consequence endures even if relationality does
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In direct contrast to the line from a
fictional song that comprises the title of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, I
must always let my students go[. And in letting them go, I trust that in
some way, shape, or form our kinship will persist, that the material we
shared (both in the sense of our readings and discussions, and in the
sense of our resultant consubstantiality) will continue to
matter.]{.underline} As in Weston's (2001, 161) analysis of Youngblood's
transfusions, "**[These are [not solidarities that endure but
solidarities that allow people to endure]{.mark}]{.underline}**." [My
students and I---like all good kin---help each other to endure, in the
sense of "to undergo without succumbing."24 As with any emergent
ecology, our kinship---"fugitive]{.underline}" (Tsing 2015, 255),
"[elusive" (282), "effervescen\[t\]" (255), "ephemeral" (255)---does not
itself solve the problems that have brought us to this point, nor does
it offer us a predictable program to follow in the face of the future's
uncertainties.]{.underline} (Needless to say, "kinship" is not now
listed among the learning outcomes I am required to include on my
syllabus.) However, like the "**[[tiny actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
that, in Kirksey's (Kirksey, Shapiro, and Brodine 2014, 49) account,
**[[have]{.mark} "the [potential]{.mark} . . . [to make]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark} a [more livable]{.mark} place]{.underline}**,"
[like]{.underline} Berrigan's (2014, 169) experiment in
[contagion]{.underline}, [which is "genuine in its reach toward empathy
and self-care" even if its "intervention is inevitably
deficient,"]{.underline} and like the [interspecies assemblages that
remind Tsing (2015, 282) that while it is "not easy to know how to make
a life \[within the ruin\], much less avert planetary destruction,"
"luckily there is still company, human and nonhuman," this social
formation limns the extant presence of alternatives both within the
sanitized, corporatized university and to the habits of thought that so
often keep us from reading higher education otherwise.]{.underline}
**[By [attending to]{.mark} such [relational possibilities
within]{.mark} the troubled [ecology of higher education]{.mark},
[we]{.mark} might [catch]{.mark} "the scent of the [latent
commons]{.mark}" (282)---one thing, it seems, [that]{.mark}
[reparative]{.mark} [queer pedagogy]{.mark} [can]{.mark} pleasurably and
ethically [track]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

disciplinary identification for whatever "IR" is]{.underline}. Some of
the responses to the "end of IR theory" argue for a retreat from grand
theory to middle-level theory (e.g., Lake, 2013); [others warn of a
"cacophony" that needs categorization to be comprehensible]{.underline}
(Jackson & Nexon, 2013, p. 543); [still others call for either
re-terming schools of IR (Michelson, 2020) or combining analytic
approaches]{.underline} (Grieco, 2019). While we see theory's continued
importance even in scholars' confusion about its appropriate role, we
recognize, [with those who declare theory's end in the discipline, that
something has changed in the structure and function of theorizing among
scholars interested in global politics]{.underline}. **[That something,
we argue, is the simultaneous recognition of and denial of the failure
of IR theorizing]{.underline}**. We contend that **[IR theorizing is
both failing and necessarily failed]{.underline}**, but that does not
make it over. Instead, we argue, [drawing on queer theory, that failure
in/of grand IR theory is something to be celebrated and actively
participated in]{.underline}. With many queer theorists (e.g.,
Halberstam, 2011), we argue that failure, rather than a normative bad,
can be a necessary corrective to the intellectual and disciplinary
stagnation implied by and implicated in practiced and accepted standards
of success. We argue that **[overwrought debates about the state of IR
theorizing could learn from queer methodology]{.underline}** (e.g.,
Weber, 2014a) **[and queer theorizing]{.underline}** (e.g., Weber,
2016a) **[not only about global politics but also about the nature of
knowledge and disciplinary politics.]{.underline}** [Queer IR has asked
how cultural ideas about gender and sexuality shape global politics, and
how heteronormative, homonormative, and cisnormative frameworks have
shaped the ways the world works]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit, 2018).
It has also turned its lenses inward, asking [why queer scholarship has
had as little influence on IR theorizing as it has]{.underline} (Weber,
2016b), and how **[queering IR could change IR's
methodological]{.underline}** (Weber, 2014a) **[and
theoretical]{.underline}** (Weber, 2014b) **[landscapes]{.underline}**.
This article looks at a small but in our view important piece of that
puzzle---how taking queer work seriously might provide insight about the
(sometimes endless) state-of-the-field debates. We see these
state-of-the-field assertions, arguments, and debates as first and
foremost recursive. Sometimes they are romances, explaining the breaking
developments that provide hopeful next steps for a blooming field (e.g.,
Acharya, 2014; Berenskotter, 2017). Sometimes they are tragedies,
spelling gloom and doom for IR as an enterprise (if not academia as a
whole) or even global politics itself (e.g., Aistrope & Fishel, 2020;
Stevens & Michelsen, 2020). Other times, they are dramas with various
players and various arguments taking various starring roles in sparring
matches (e.g., Jackson & Nexon, 2009; Parashar, 2013). Sometimes they
are histories, tracing the past into the present or the present into the
past (Alekseyeva, 2016; Schmidt & Guilhot, 2019). Sometimes they are
sociologies, explaining how this and that theory relates to this and
that other theory (Aris, 2020; Barkin & Sjoberg, 2019). Sometimes they
are serials, explaining how particular approaches ebb and flow or evolve
(e.g., Epstein, 2013; Guzzini, 2013). Sometimes they are sports reports,
talking about which side wins what when (e.g., Acharya, 2005; Legro &
Moravcsik, 1999). [Most state-of-the-field evaluations make the various
protagonists and antagonists (theories or theorists) seem so at odds, so
different, and the stakes of the debates so dire.]{.underline} We argue
that, with few exceptions, these stories, despite their different forms,
different characters, and different plotlines, are all the same. They
are [more often than not the product of gender, sex, race, sexuality,
national origin, education, and employment privilege that produce a
narrow view of what is and what should be, based on the practices that
have provided the success from which the privileged writer
writes]{.underline}. As Weber (2014b, p. 29) argues, "**[disciplinary
IR's commitments and standards are as much the performative result of
the so-called 'mainstream' agendas of learned societies, universities,
independent funding agencies, and governments ... as they are the
performative outcome of so-called 'dissident' practices"]{.underline}**
(citing Ashley & Walker, 1990; Soreanu, 2010). In fact, Weber suggests
that the [radical critical edge of IR and its mainstream "foes" are
really "intricately intertwined positions" which "produce a disciplinary
IR that claims to speak for the whole of the discipline" out of power
rather than legitimacy]{.underline} (Weber, 2014b, p. 29). In concrete
terms, we argue that the **[current "state" of state-of-the-field
stories and debates is intimately and necessarily tied not only to
heteronormative, traditionalized rules and norms of scholarly practice
but also to heteronormative, traditionalized understandings of success,
failure, and their value.]{.underline}** In this article, we argue that
the things that the state-of-the-field literature agrees on betray a
narrow and problematic approach to what knowledge is, how it works, who
has it, and how it can be. We suggest that **[IR]{.underline}** on these
terms **[is always and already a failed enterprise]{.underline}**, [no
matter what spin the stateof-the-field literature puts on]{.underline}
[it]{.underline}. **[IR fails to reach any expected or desired end of
the enterprise of IR theorizing. It fails to achieve coherence or fails
to approximate some measure]{.underline}** (citations, downloads, and
publisher quality) socially understood as failure's opposite. **[It
fails to find clarity or directions]{.underline}**. **[It fails because
it must---its idealized goals are unachievable and require it to be
something that it cannot be]{.underline}**, [and remain its seductive
unquestioned/unquestionable ends, despite an obvious need for
reevaluation and, possibly, the embrace of failure]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1991 \[1979\]; Halberstam, 2011). Rather than arguing that
IR's success and failure need to be redefined, we contend that IR's
success and failure need to be normatively reinterpreted. We argue that
seeing IR as a failure, and embracing its failings, provides a realistic
and intellectually grounded path for IR's "futures," putting to rest the
state-of-the-field fairy tales and encyclopedias once and for all.

#### The paradigm of IR relies on the valorization of traditional research as a metric of "success" -- voting negative imbricates debate in the echo chamber of normative political theory that accumulates rigid forms of knowledge while reproducing the exclusion of queerness.

We argue that **[knowledge cumulation in IR is a fantasy reified by
paradigmatic clusters and the mimicry of research standards and
practices in the natural sciences]{.underline}** (e.g., Elman & Elman,
2001, 2003). The "evidence" of "knowledge cumulation" in IR comes as
much from the ritualized practice of research behavior as it does from
any "true" or genuine notion of knowledge cumulation. One has
"succeeded" in the enterprise of IR by cumulating knowledge, and the
work of "successful" scholars is by definition cumulated knowledge.
Cumulation of knowledge as a standard of success is a condition of
possibility for the desirability of success in the field. That
ritualized practice at once is institutionalized as success and
institutionalizes the need for research success, reified and reproduced
by hiring, tenure, merit raise, and promotion standards. This
ritualization is a signifier that what counts as knowledge in the field,
in particular research programs and more generally, is performative
(Barad, 2007; Butler, 1990; Weber, 1998)---where standards are set by
their utterance and repetition rather than by some external "objective"
standards of (narrowly) good science or (more broadly) good research
(Baudrillard, 1991; Shepherd, 2008; Williams, 2003). Scholars iterate
and reify standards of measurement of knowledge in each piece of
scholarship which "succeeds" in the field, and these iterations make it
a paradox for scholars to both occupy the methodological,
epistemological, and political space that falls outside of inherited
standards and succeed. Outside -the -mainstream work's
underrepresentation in the places understood to be publishing "success"
is overdetermined, and the correlation between mimicry of traditional
scholarship and "success" of critical scholars a given. We mean
"performative" in the sense that Judith Butler uses it (Butler, 1990,
1993), particularly as she talks about it going hand in hand with a
Foucauldian notion of disciplining,8 where "performativity cannot be
understood outside of a process of iterability---a regularized and
constrained repetition of norms" which resonate as "ritualized
production" (Butler, 1993, p. 60). This frames performativity as a
"specific modality of power as discourse" (Butler, 1993, p. 139) where
the politics of the signification and the politics of the sign meet, an
act of territoralization, of production, of installation---which does
not have to be alone, singular, or unidirectional. Since performatives
are their own referent (Butler, 1993, p. 159), they proliferate as
manifestations of the power underlying them and interact relatively on
the basis of that relative power. In this context, "performances" are
actions and events, iterations and reifications, and context-specific,
which "bring a subject into being" relationally.9 To escape the
recursive, performative loop of "disciplinary success," we argue that it
is important to see the possibility that knowledge cumulation is not,
and should not be, a given in IR research. Instead, we argue that the
idea itself is an inherited empty signifier with unspoken content which
governs the production of what we understand as disciplinary IR.
Traditionally, the idea of knowledge cumulation is firmly grounded in a
neopositivist understanding of social science, in which the role of
theory is to collate observed empirical regularities across cases or
what Waltz calls laws (Waltz, 1979). While this interpretation is
critiqued in most critical IR, "cumulation," in that work, becomes a
term without clear conceptual content. The paradigmatization of IR
theorizing distracts from a particular theory's internal conditions of
possibility by introducing incompatible conditions of possibility drawn
from an inherited disciplinary sociology of what knowledge is and how it
works. As such, any acknowledgment of the idea of cumulativity from
within specific exercises in reflexive IR creates the grounds for
necessary failure within those exercises. The simultaneous rejection of
traditional "cumulation" and continued performance of acts of cumulation
can be understood by seeing the ways that silence frames cumulation in
critical IR. We learn from feminist theorists that the unspoken is as
important as if not more important than what is spoken (Charlesworth,
1999; Kronsell, 2006), coming from attention to how IR's others are
omitted, excluded, kept out, and not mentioned (Agathangelou & Ling,
2004; Tickner, 1988). We argue that IR's silences tell us more about the
state of knowledge cumulation in the discipline than looking for
standards that tell us what we do know. Accordingly, we ask on principle
what any given research program does not take account of and how
accounting for those omissions could changes analysis. We focus on both
visible omissions (like the concepts that a research program fails to
incorporate) and invisible omissions. Invisible omissions are those that
are unhearable by a research program--- normally left out or ignored by
both the researchers that form the core of the research program and
their critics (Butler, 2001; Edkins et al., 2012; Hansen, 2000). By
"unhearable," we mean either that the omitted content falls outside of
the boundaries set for dialog or is assumed by all stakeholders to be by
definition irrelevant (for deeper analyses see MacKinnon, 2006; Spivak,
1988). Unlike its visible omissions---variables that its scholars and
their critics have added to, re-operationalized, expanded on, or
suggested the inclusion of---invisible omissions are often not treated
as omissions at all within particular scholarly boundaries.10 The
discipline's "collective" standards for knowledge production, then, can
be understood as constituted by social performances of dominance rather
than founded on some given or objective notions of what science should
be. Rather than being objective judgments of quality, statements like
"this is good science" and "these results are robust" are signs without
referents used to discipline (Baudrillard, 1995). The invisible
disciplining nature of the performative standards of knowledge
cumulation is part of the story of Butler's understanding of
performativity. The other part is attention to who is excluded by claims
to knowledge cumulation (generally as well as in specific paradigmatic
situations), what is left out, and on what axes. These disciplinary
standards (both in the conventional and Foucauldian sense) make
invisible their own impossibility and their related necessary failure.
For example, a submission to a traditional IR journal in the United
States or Western Europe which makes an interesting argument, but is not
in the format of, methodologically acceptable to, inclusive of the same
forms of evidence traditionally used in, and good science to that
journal's traditional reviewers is unlikely to succeed in getting
published.11 This will generally be justified with reference to the
"quality" of the piece, and rarely if ever will questions of sex, race,
gender, class, and other axes of exclusion be discussed as producers of
the standards that then exclude on "quality" where "quality" has been
set up in a way that excludes all performances of scholarship which are
not mimicry of a particular Western, liberal model (Paolini, 1999).12
Even editors and reviewers who note the exclusionary effect of these
standards will often mourn that and move on, imagining the only possible
alternative being lacking standards, and seeing such a lack of standards
as more insidious than the exclusionary effects of using certain sets of
standards. "Knowledge cumulation" then becomes a set of reified and
artificial standards rather than a journey for truth or interest. The
answer to this quagmire is sometimes a liberal politics of inclusion
(e.g., Nedal & Nexon, 2018)---how do "we" get more women, more
minorities, and more people from underrepresented places in the world to
be able to meet the standards of good scholarship in the field? That
liberal politics of inclusion, while well-intended, can be read as a
(subtle, perhaps accidental) expansion of the violence it (formally)
seems to abate. It fails to question the utility of the existing
standards of good scholarship and assumes that those currently excluded
would be happy to change the form, shape, and/ or nature of their
scholarship to fit within the (unquestioned/unquestionable) mold of good
scholarship, either loosely or strictly understood. As Puar (2006)
argues, liberal "inclusion" to absorb the other within can be as violent
as if not more so than exclusion even as it appears progressive. That
violence is the reproduction of naturalized, bounded identities when
identities are liminal and messy when not policed (e.g., Agathangelou,
2013; Haritaworn et al., 2013; Scott, 2013). The bounded nature of IR
inclusion excludes liminality, messiness, and outsideness (e.g.,
Malksoo, 2012 ¨ ). Expanding the boundaries of IR to include any given
particular excluded work maintains an illusion of stability, hiding what
is unstable; it maintains an illusion of certainty, hiding what is in
doubt; it maintains an illusion of coherence, hiding the rebellious, the
failed, and that which remains outside (e.g., Sjoberg, 2017). Queer
theorizing of the liminality involved in unstable sex/gender identities
shows that even that which is presumed to be the most primordial (sex
identity) is really liminality hiding under supposed definition (e.g.,
Weber, 2016a). Translated to thinking about inhabitability, this
theorizing suggests that the apparent safety of (constituting then
occupying) inhabitable space hides liminality and uncertainty, and
perhaps danger, under its supposed (empirical and normative) clarity
(Haritaworn et al., 2014). Therefore, "all the repressive and reductive
strategies of power systems are already present in the internal logic of
the sign," such "that violence is an inevitable byproduct of
signification" (Baudrillard, 1981). In this way, not only do traditional
standards of knowledge make invisible their own impossibility, they hide
the violence of IR's denials of failure and continued insistence on
traveling failed paths despite the condemnation of failure and the
privileging of success. IR's continued recursive enactment of its
settled "standards" despite their obvious failure and exclusiveness
makes invisible the raced, classed, and sexed impacts of those standards
and their apparent objectivity. Baudrillard's work provides a path for
navigating this disjuncture between signs (IR's "standards") and
referents (the fantastic notion that "good scholarship" exists
objectively) (Baudrillard, 1975). He argues that "only ambivalence, as a
rupture of value... sustains a challenge to the legibility, the false
transparency of the sign... questions the evidence of the use value of
the sign (rational decoding) and of its exchange value (the discourse of
communication)." This ambivalence, Baudrillard argues, "brings the
political economy of the sign to a standstill; it dissolves the
respective definitions of symbol and referent" (Baudrillard, 1981, p.
150). Endorsing the inclusion of nontraditional perspectives,
classifying and categorizing them, and assuming inclusion's possibility
may all have violent impacts (for discussions of the violences of
inclusion see Haritaworn et al., 2013, 2014; Mbembe, 2019). Moving of
the signification "knowledge" from any referent to which it was
originally tied makes method and research performances of scholarship,
rather than (the illusive) scholarship itself. If "research" is a
performance of scholarship, "standards" for research serve to disguise
the fantastic nature of knowledge cumulation. As such, there is no space
for liminality, uncertainty, change, inadequacy, and failure in
structural rather than passing senses. Yet looking beyond the discourse
of certainty, those pervade IR. A Baudrillardian ambivalence toward
research programs and their truth statements can reveal the recursivity
of IR's standards of knowledge cumulation. This is because condemnation
or rejection of any given research program and its truth statements
endorses its assumptions about truth, as well as some of its assumptions
about what the international arena is and how it works. As such, the
idea that IR knowledge cumulation can be nothing but fantasy is
straightforward. If the reification of standards of knowledge cumulation
is a signification divorced from a referent, where the recovery of the
referent is conceptually and practically impossible, then knowledge
cumulation is and will always remain an empty signifier. The only
question is how that empty signifier directs and is directed. We suggest
that, in IR, more often than not, knowledge cumulation directs and is
directed by discursive seduction. In Baudrillard's words, seduction is
"that which extracts meaning from discourse and detracts it from its
truth" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). What makes a discourse of
knowledge, of science, and of progress seductive "is its very
appearance: the aleatory, meaningless, or ritualistic and meticulous
circulation of signs on the surface, its inflections and its nuances.
All of this effaces the content value of meaning, and this is seductive"
(Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). Therefore, if there could be an
interpretive discourse of knowledge cumulation that reached truth value,
that truth value would be selfdefeating, since "the meaning of an
interpretive discourse, by contrast, has never seduced anyone." This is
the fundamental contradiction, in Baudrillard's terms, that makes
standards for knowledge cumulation in IR internally impossible. He
explains that "every interpretive discourse wants to get beyond
appearances; this is its illusion and fraud. But getting beyond
appearances is appearance, and is hence subject to the stakes imposed by
seduction, and consequently to its own failure as discourse"
(Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). As such, what is left in/of the
failed discourse can only be the fantastic, and pretensions to success
hollow.

#### Reject their disciplinary scholarship -- the potentiality of international theory exists in the liminality of politics, in the possibilities opened by embracing queer instability and failure.

If IR's state-of-the-field debates are alternatively narrativized fairy
tales, we have a replacement. We suggest that the fairy tales' idealized
end can be found not in success but in failure; not in agreement but in
controversy; not in aggrandized claims but in careful thought; not in
stability but in liminality.15 It is hitching our wagon to a failure of
a discipline and acknowledging that failure that constitutes and creates
the possibility of a happily ever after for IR theory. We see the
answers to many of these questions bound up in a disciplinary IR that
has racist, sexist, heterosexist, and cissexist intellectual
orientations and remains silent about them and often the assumptions
that prop them up. But even work which decenters or critiques these
exclusions in IR, in our view, is positioned compared to or in
opposition to the discipline's existing structure. Rather than being
disappointed that IR theories are exclusive, cannot be reduced to a
single theory, cannot account for global politics as a whole, and cannot
present grand narratives of their competitive advantages visa-vis other
approaches, we suggest highlighting and inhabiting these failures.
Questioning the terms of disciplinary success as lying in a tightly
choreographed dance (peer review in elite journals) or a popularity
contest (citation count), or even in the "science" of knowledge
cumulation, we ask why empty signifiers continue to dictate value in a
wide variety of channels in IR. But we do not think redefining success
will "solve" this "problem," no matter how well-intended or radical the
redefinition is. Note that we are not denying the existence or
importance of significant transgressive work within IR, work that
rejects grand narrativizing, or other explicit or implicit attempts to
embrace failure. We are under the impression that authors critiqued here
might actually agree with our critiques, either placing themselves
within them or taking exception to them. We are not looking to signal
virtue or to exclude, simply to suggest an explicit alternative
approach. Instead of looking for an alternative, emphasizing some of the
"good" transgressions, finding another way to succeed, or recasting
success, we look to deconstruct IR's logics of success and failure, and,
with them, its mimicry of reified standards and its fantasies of
knowledge cumulation. We see rewards in embracing IR theory's failure to
live up to IR theorists' expectations of it. With Halberstam, "perhaps
most obviously, failure ... disturbs the supposedly clean boundaries
between...winners and losers" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). Declaring, and
embracing, knowledge cumulation failure (and thus, IR's intellectual
failure) "allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline
behavior" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). The relevant norms in IR are the
fetishization of science, the fetishization of progression and progress,
and the establishment and reification of boundaries of what ideas matter
to the field. In embracing failure and escaping those punishing norms
that are as violent in their inclusion (e.g., Haritaworn et al., 2014)
as they are in their exclusion, "queer studies offer us one method for
imagining, not some fantasy of an elsewhere, but existing alternatives
to hegemonic systems" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 89). It "can be a potent
form of critique,... a refusal of the norm, an indifference to
assimilation, and a route to other ways of being in the world"
(Halberstam, 2012). Here, the alternative to the hegemonic system of
claims of knowledge cumulation is the queer, understood as both liminal
and anti-heteronormative, as a foundation for theorizing more nuanced
understandings of knowledge than success or failure at cumulation. If
scholars find their affirmation in (hollow) confirmations of their
claims to knowledge cumulation, a queer politics of failure suggests a
different direction. As Halberstam recommends, "rather than resisting
endings and limits, let us instead revel in... all of our own inevitable
fantastic failures" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 187). Reveling in fantastic
failures, in terms of a queer critique of the fantasy of progressive
knowledge cumulation, has two elements: celebrating research as failure
and confronting the future given that embrace. Queer theory suggests
guidelines for embracing failure; "failing is something queers do
well"---not (only) in the self-deprecating sense of laughing at (one's
own) flaws, but also in the more fruitful sense of exposing the
ridiculousness of norms by failing to live up to them. In this sense,
queer failure is "a map of the path not taken" (Weber, 2014a, 2014b). As
such, "queerness offers the promise of failure as a way of life,...but
it is up to us whether we choose to make good on that promise in a way
that makes a detour around the usual markers of accomplishment and
satisfaction" (Halberstam, 2011, loc 3281). "Failing" to meet
expectations and being fine repudiates the salvation narrative that
accompanies the "right" rules and norms and lifts the often terrible
consequences of falling outside "the norm" while removing the privileges
of "belonging" to the category of success. The exposure and analysis of
queer failure denaturalizes the coherence of knowledge-production
performances to show the vapidity inside. We see the replacement of
"all-encompassing global theories" with those "subjugated knowledges"
which have been "buried or masked in functional coherences or formal
systemization" as a key first step but insufficient by itself
(Halberstam, 2011). Turning IR's "losers" into its "winners" would both
serve social justice and unsettle the binary itself, but rejecting the
categories writ large would both upset the politics of exclusion in
those categories and discourage the win-seeking behavior that makes
state-of-the-field debates. Celebrating failure instead "provides the
opportunity to use \[failure's\] negative effects to poke holes in the
toxic positivity of contemporary life" where "the negative thinker can
use the experience of failure to confront the gross inequalities of
everyday life" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3, 4). The "toxic positivity" in IR
theorizing is the attachment to the utility of grand theory that
cumulates knowledge which makes the inequalities in the discipline
appear to be organized by some sense of objective quality, where
"success happens to good people" and good research while failure happens
to bad work or bad people (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). Instead, we see
those inequalities as structural and standards of success in IR as
political. IR's happily ever after, then, if it is to have one, must be
in the failure, in the mess, and in rejecting both inherited
interpretations of success and of the normative relationship between
success and failure. It must be not only in not meeting expectations of
any given state-of-the-discipline proselytizing but also in instead
realizing that IR cannot and should not approximate those expectations.
It is not a progressive discipline with a singular end or an exercise in
progressive knowledge cumulation. It is instead necessarily
undisciplined---it must put aside the straightjackets of research
standards, the ego-stroking of aggrandized claims, and the authorial
voice of the telling of the discipline's past, present, and future---to
embrace liminality and the necessity (and beauty) of failure. The irony
of this argument is not lost on us. Halberstam, making the queer theory
case for celebrating failure, has become a very successful academic by
many of the traditional disciplinary standards, and The Queer Art of
Failure is a successful academic text. Many of the critics and
supporters cited here have built on academic success by their engagement
with the argument. We are bringing the case to IR, publishing it in a
academic journal, through the traditional mechanism of peer review, from
the comfort of secure and permanent academic employment. We poke holes
where those holes can be seen by those who would police the boundaries
between winners and losers. This article does not "practice" as it
"preaches," to itself upend the "winners" and "losers" in disciplinary
IR---it is couched in both necessary and unnecessary hypocrisy. But
positionally at the very least, our celebration of failure is itself a
failure---implicated in our interest in and disciplinary IR's promotion
of success. We are not arguing that failure can be made pure or that it
should be---only that it cannot and should not be escaped, especially
for the glorification of success as its perceived opposite. As we fail
at failure to demonstrate the fantasy of success, we envision a happily
ever after of failing, un-discipline, and diversity rather than a faux
idealism of synthesis, aggrandizement, "science," and disciplining.

Queer pedagogy and questions of gender identity and sexual orientation
For many American researchers and activists, [the concept of queerness
seeks to incorporate bodies that lost visibility]{.underline} during the
gay movement of the 1960s and 1970s. From this perspective, the gay and
lesbian movement was normalized as it adopted heteronormative practices
(like marriage and the adoption of children) to gain public acceptance.
The term 'queer,' then[, attempts to recover individuals erased by this
normalization]{.underline}, such as feminine boys, transsexual people,
transgender people, and non-binary or gender non-conforming people among
others. Briefly retracing a possible historiography of queer theory, by
the beginning of 1970s, gay literary studies began to flourish in the
American academic world. As the gay movement started to seek out and
create its own culture and identity, it began to look not only to the
past but also to the future. In the 1980s, U.S. political activism,
still maintaining its attention to the past, adopted the word 'queer' as
a driver of the movement, a word that up until then, had been considered
the most commonly used homophobic term in the country. In other words,
the political movement reincorporated a term, previously carrying a
negative connotation, trying, in this way, to deconstruct its pejorative
meaning. [Taken up by the academy, queer theory seeks to denounce the
heteronormativity that influences even the gay movement.]{.underline}
That is, the gay movement is accepted only to the extent that it
conforms to certain social values pre-established by society, rejecting
those who do not follow that norm.2 Teresa de Lauretis (1991) states
that the term ['queer' should function as something that causes
discomfort]{.underline}, juxtaposed to the words lesbian and gay in the
subtitle to mark a certain critical distance from the vocabulary used in
the past. For De Lauretis, [queer is the 'non-canonical,' polyphonic,
transgressive, and problematic.]{.underline} Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick
(2008) too affirms that the term [constitutes a moment, a movement, a
continuous motive. Queer pedagogy, based in these ideas of a queer
theory against normalization, seeks to contribute to practices of
education, analyzing the fluidity and the mobility of society and
affirming that educational institutions should not attach themselves to
one set model, since these ideals end up alienating, even excluding,
certain individuals]{.underline}. For Britzman (1998), [queer theory
transgresses seemingly stable representations and, in this sense, queer
pedagogy works to question situations of apparent normality in the
classroom and concerns itself with the social production of what is
learned.]{.underline} Queer pedagogy [does not seek the 'correct' method
or the 'right' questions]{.underline}, but rather the possibility to
question our practices or notions of equality and acceptance. Just as
queer theory sought to distance itself from the markers of gender
associated with gay and lesbian studies, queer pedagogy offers everyone
involved in academic spaces, whether they be heterosexual, homosexual,
bisexual, asexual, etc., the possibility of understanding issues of
sexuality from a new angle. As Louro (2001) explains: "(...) [a queer
pedagogy and curriculum 'speak' to everyone and aren't only directed at
those who recognize themselves in this subject position]{.underline},
that is, as queer subjects."3 (p. 256). [Queer pedagogy offers a
critical view of the practices of exclusion that are naturalized in the
classroom by a banal heteronormativity4 that makes all those who don't
fit into a certain standard invisible]{.underline}. As Britzman (1998)
demonstrates, queer theory [recognizes the exorbitant normality in
effect and the ways in which that normality ignores queer pleasures,
practices, and bodies]{.underline}. Neither does said pedagogy seek
merely to trade one norm for another, to simply leave a heterosexist
binary for a heterosexual--homosexual modality. A queer lens for
pedagogical practice would mean observing the varied possibilities of
expression of sexuality without the necessity of labels or fixed
identities. The recognition of different forms of expression would
broaden an individual's perspective, without that person having to
necessarily adopt one of these fixed identities, allowing them to
acknowledge these identities or even recognize themselves in said
identities. It becomes necessary, then, to [question and challenge
dominant models in school]{.underline}s today so that socially favored
groups are not the only ones visible, including as well other bodies
that are still oppressed by different spheres of society. [Queer
pedagogy can help us in two ways. First, by problematizing the very
school structure, the normalization of teaching per se and of the fixed
and exclusionary content that is presented.]{.underline} Using a queer
lens would involve, for example, discussing why terms like gay, lesbian,
bisexual, and transgender do not find space in school vocabulary and why
when they do, it is only through insults that should be silenced. More
than prohibiting that students or even teachers use these words as
insults, it is important to have a discussion of such use. To be gay or
transgender is part of the identity of an individual and as such, should
be included in the day-to-day just as ethnicity, religion, and many
other aspects should be.5 As Britzman (2012) explains, [queer pedagogy
aims at 'something different than a plea for inclusion or merely adding
marginalized voices to an overpopulated curriculum.']{.underline} (p.
297). [It is not the normalization of the 'different' that queer
pedagogy proposes, is to 'recognize difference outside the imperatives
of normalcy.']{.underline} (p. 304).

#### 3 \-- Academic Politicization DA -- debate as a political discipline is defined by the process of delineation between valorized and antagonized modes of knowledge production -- resist the call of the negative to act as the procedural enforcer of counterinsurgency and embrace a queer interpretation of the resolution that calls into question the pervasion of state politics and its production of dominant ideological narratives.

As Laura Shepherd (2012) notes: '[The idea of a discipline (noun), in
the academic sense, clearly derives from the verb: both relate to
establishing clear boundaries between what is right and good
(behaviour/research) and what is wrong and bad
(behaviour/research);]{.underline} both [have ways to correct
transgression when an uninitiated (or resistant) person strays
\[original emphasis\]]{.underline}'. We would like to take this further
and argue that it is [through the very process of disciplining (verb)
that an academic 'discipline' (noun) such as political science comes
into being]{.underline}. That is, it is precisely [through the
construction, maintenance and policing of carefully-demarcated
boundaries that political science becomes constituted as a discipline:
the centre is not separate from the margins but is constituted in and
through them]{.underline} (Doty 1997). Important here, then, is how
political science has [come to be defined as a field of study and, in
particular, how 'politics' is seen to be the natural preserve of the
state.]{.underline} Many of our students have undertaken A-levels in
'Government and Politics' and a number of political science departments
in the UK and internationally currently feature 'Government and
Politics' in the title.9 And one of the first---and most
central---questions most first-year undergraduate students are asked to
address is whether or not politics and government are synonymous (with
the tacit message that, no, they are not the same but, yes, they do
nevertheless 'naturally' go together, hence why the question is posed).
A key problem regarding queer theory here is that it has not, as yet,
had a great deal to say about the state (although see for instance
Duggan 1994; Bernstein and Reimann 2001; Brandzel 2005). But it also
reflects how [states and bodies are nevertheless imagined to reside in
different realms: the state is often seen as synonymous with the
'public' sphere of politics---a world of government, power and
collectivity---whereas the body is frequently imagined to reside in the
'private' sphere---a world of intimacy, selfhood and
individuality.]{.underline} Yet feminist scholarship has long sought to
highlight how [this supposedly straightforward division between states
and bodies is, in fact, deeply gendered]{.underline}. Indeed, a central
project for feminist theory has precisely been to reveal how [the state
itself is often coded as masculine: that is, it is associated with the
public realm of political power and decision-making and, as such, with
masculine influence and identit]{.underline}y (Youngs 2000a). The [body,
in contrast, is frequently coded as feminine in its multiple
associations with nature, emotions, sexuality, vulnerability,
reproduction and the family]{.underline} (Hooper 2000). In so doing,
feminists have sought to expose and challenge the complex ways in which
['body politics' become invisible, denied and erased]{.underline} (for a
detailed discussion see Jenkins 2005). Charlotte Hooper (2000, 39), for
instance, has explored how rational masculinity is organised around a
series of gendered dualisms (including public/private, mind/body, and
inside/outside) that include a 'fantasy of disembodiment' which 'depends
upon the apparent invisibility or absence of bodies in social discourse,
so that masculine reason could be separate from and untainted from the
body'. As such, feminists have sought to reveal [the 'problem of the
missing body' in social and political discourse in order to expose and
challenge how this very invisibility is steeped in]{.underline}, and
(re)productive of, power relations (Youngs 2000b, 1). In this way,
feminists have also sought to show how bodies and politics are
intertwined, for the body is: \... a place for political mobilization
interconnected with other sites of resistance and political action \...
[bodies are not external to political processes but firmly enmeshed in
them]{.underline}, even if they are not necessarily the defining site
for action. The [lived experience of the body, the identity and
definitions attached to bodies, inform and are connected to all
political struggles]{.underline} (Harcourt 2009, 23).10 Queer Theory and
Political Science One of the most crucially important contributions of
feminist political analysis, then, has precisely been to gender the
state (for a review see Kantola 2006) but also, more fundamentally, to
show how the personal is political and, consequently, to shift the focus
from politics-as-government to politics-as-power. This latter notion is,
of course, shared by many political scientists---indeed, to quote one of
the aforementioned textbooks, Hay's (2002, 168) Political Analysis
states[: 'power specifies the sphere of the political]{.underline}:
power is to political analysis what the economy is to economics
\[original emphases\]'. What is interesting, though, is that although
[political science has a great deal to say about power, so too does
queer theory.]{.underline} [Queer theory is, in fact, centrally
concerned with the (re)production of power relations; power is, in
short, what queer theory is about]{.underline}. Although there is no one
approach to power in queer studies---rather, [power represents a key
site of contestation within queer theorising---queer scholars frequently
ask questions about power that 'seek to expose the limitations, unstable
foundations and power-laden assumptions of the "straight" political,
psychological, cultural and economic discourses that govern]{.underline}
us' (Griffin 2011, 50). At the same time, while queer theory has much to
say about power as it relates to sexuality, it can also denote '[any
form of research positioned within conceptual frameworks that highlight
the instability of taken-for-granted meanings and resulting power
relations']{.underline} (Browne and Nash 2010, 4).11 It is not (just)
sexual norms but rather norms per se that a great deal of [queer theory
seeks to expose and destabilise]{.underline}. As Butler writes: \...
[power pervades the very conceptual apparatus that seeks to negotiate
its terms, including the subject position of the critic; and \... this
implication of the terms of criticism in the field of power is not the
advent of a nihilistic relativism incapable of furnishing norms, but,
rather, the very precondition of a politically engaged
critique]{.underline}. To [establish a set of norms that are beyond
power or force is itself a powerful and forceful conceptual
practice]{.underline} that sublimates, disguises and extends its own
power play through recourse to tropes of normative universality (Butler
1994, 6--7). Rather than being (only) interested in what truths are,
then, [queer theory (also) asks us to consider what 'truths' do---that
is, it asks: 'What gets to be constituted as "truth" and what are the
material effects of this?]{.underline}' So, for example, rather than
asking a question such as 'What does it mean to be "human"?' (or, put
differently, 'What is the essence or truth of "the human"?'), queer
theorists might ask a rather different question: ['What gets to be
constituted as "human", and what doesn't?]{.underline} Who gets to be
included in "the human", and who is left out? And [what are the material
effects of this, in terms of the ability of the "less-than-human" to
live a fully liveable life?']{.underline} (for a detailed discussion see
Butler 2001). An [important purpose of social and political theory is
thus to critique how specific appeals to 'truth' become presented as
universal and timeless rather than as contingent and contestable and how
this can in turn legitimise violence and disadvantag]{.underline}e
within and across particular political, economic and cultural contexts.
Indeed, this is a further reason why [queer theory is written out of
political science--- because it seeks to destabilise rather than to
discover foundational truths, it is dismissed as therefore being
apolitica]{.underline}l (and even downright unethical---see for instance
Martha Nussbaum's outright condemnation of Butler's work in Nussbaum
(1999)). Yet, as we've noted above, [queer theory is fundamentally
concerned with questions of power and---far from rejecting ethical
enquiry---instead aims to uncover and critique how particular moral
orders become naturalised, necessitated and thus positioned as being
beyond ethical scrutiny]{.underline}.12 Equally, what queer theory does
is to encourage reflection on what it means for something to be
'political'. [What gets to be constituted as 'political' and what
doesn't? What gets to become an object of 'politics' in academic enquiry
and, indeed, public deliberation more broadly? What gets to be studied,
discussed, contested, written about, cited, lectured on, and what
doesn't? I]{.underline}n short: what's in and what's out? More than
this, queer theory also insists that [what gets to be counted as
'political' is itself political---it is a product of the exercise of
power, with real material effects]{.underline}. In this sense, queer
theory seeks to politicise 'the political' itself.

#### 4 \-- Linear Education DA \-- Modern day education functions along linear logic -- the construction and formation of subjects in certain ways after time. Our argument is that these forms of linearity are exactly what is used to create "docility" from queer subjects, forcing them into discreet indentitarian formations through the process of chrononormativity.

[What, then, is Time]{.underline}? I know well enough what it is,
provided that nobody asks me; but if I am asked what it is and try to
explain, I am baffled.7

In his series of lectures titled "Birth of Biopolitics," [Foucault
formulates the idea that the delimitation between state and society
marks the turn from liberalism into neoliberalism.
Neoliberalism,]{.underline} as Foucault defines it, [is a political
rationality that merges the social sphere with the economic sphere as a
means to reduce state services and shift the language of responsibility
and morality onto the individual subject body.]{.underline} Within
neoliberalism, [there is a shift in governmentality and social
regulation "in the sense that subjects are increasingly conceived and
conceive themselves as entrepreneurs of the self, who attempt to
maximize their human capital."8 As Thomas Lemke goes on to
explain:]{.underline}

The [neoliberal forms of government feature not only direct intervention
by means of empowered and specialized state apparatuses, but also
characteristically develop indirect techniques for leading and
controlling individuals]{.underline} without at the same time being
responsible for them. The [strategy of rendering individual subjects
\"responsible\"]{.underline} (and also collectives, such as families
associations, etc.) [entails shifting the responsibility for social
risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. and for life in
society into the domain for which the individual is responsible
\...]{.underline} The key [feature]{.underline} of the neoliberal
rationality i[s the congruence it endeavors to achieve between a
responsible and moral individual and an economic-rational individual. It
aspires to construct responsible subjects]{.underline} whose moral
[quality is based on the fact that they rationally assess the costs and
benefits of a certain act as opposed to other alternative
acts]{.underline}.9

This "[neoliberal rationality" roots itself through different regimes of
truth]{.underline}, the [types of discourse that get accepted as
truth]{.underline} and [established as hegemonic]{.underline} within the
system in power. For example, in neoliberalism the [language of morality
becomes ascribed onto economic responsibility, and the neoliberal
subject replaces the regulatory mechanisms of the state as a
self-regulating subject]{.underline}, or human capital, of the free
market. Therefore, [neoliberalism becomes a determining factor in the
societal and governmental response to AIDS in the form of what Leo
Bersani calls "malignant aversion,"]{.underline} in which the funding
for research and treatment for AIDS was delayed, a push was made towards
testing rather than curing, and policies were made that had more to do
with protecting straight communities from being penetrated rather than
with saving queer communities. More specifically, [in response to AIDS,
"a public health crisis \[was\] treated like an unprecedented sexual
threat" brought on by the queer body and its inability to police and
regulate its own desires, and there was a "general tendency to think of
AIDS as an epidemic of the future rather than a catastrophe of the
present."]{.underline}10 Therefore, during the AIDS epidemic, [queer
bodies within the neoliberal system became synonymous with death caused
by an individual moral failure and sexual threat.]{.underline}

I engage with the term [chronobiopolitics]{.underline} from a
Foucauldian perspective [in which we understand neoliberalism to be a
configuration of power relations that is not only an intensification of
capitalism and capitalist exploitation of bodies,]{.underline} but [also
a system that creates biopolitical regimes of truth]{.underline}11 that
[establish social practices necessary for the sustainment of
neoliberalism as absolute]{.underline}. In this thesis, I [situate
linear temporality and chrononormativity as one such example of a regime
of truth that neoliberalism asserts on the queer body with AIDS in order
to regulate the individual subject body.]{.underline} Elizabeth Freeman
describes this regulatory structure of temporality as such:

Naked [flesh is bound into socially meaningful embodiment through
temporal regulation: binding is what turns mere existence into a form of
mastery in a process I'll refer to as chrononormativity]{.underline}, or
the use of time to organize individual [human bodies toward maximum
productivity.]{.underline} And I mean that [people are bound to one
another, engrouped, made to feel coherently collective, through
particular orchestrations of time: Dana Luciano has termed this
chronobiopolitics, or "the sexual arrangement of the time of life" of
entire populations.12]{.underline}

The heteron[ormative structuring of social reality works under this very
assumption of a chrononormativity that is linear and
progressive]{.underline}, in which [milestone markers of individual
development---grade school graduation, college, career development and
advancement,]{.underline} [creating a nuclear family]{.underline}---are
enforced and adhered to properly. The [failure to adhere to this
chrononormative timeline is seen as a failure to produce and mature into
a moral, responsible member of society]{.underline}. Particularly in
regards to productivity and the [individual responsibility to maximize
one's own "human capital," time becomes synonymous with
money]{.underline}, and ever[y minute becomes a commodity that must be
capitalized on. Linear time becomes central to the organization and the
maintenance of the commercial structure of society: hourly wages,
monthly rent, time-interest rates, and built credit over time---things
that visibly queer bodies of the late twentieth century did not often
get access to.]{.underline}

#### Queer temporality produces space and time for queer lives, enabling us to think gender and sexuality differently

Cyborgs are not the only figures in science fiction that get us to
question heteronormativity and other regulatory means;
[aliens,]{.underline} and other [posthuman figure]{.underline}s also
[abstract notions of the self and Other]{.underline}, the importance of
the body, and queer relationships, [particularly through the homosocial
bonds]{.underline} these figures form with humans and non-humans alike.
In this dissertation, the major questions I will address are: How does
science fiction provide spaces and temporalities that allow us to relate
to and understand diverse queer subjectivities? How does Latin American
science fiction use colonial narratives of space travel to make evident
the connection between gender, race, sexuality, and coloniality? How
does the construction of non-human and quasi-human subjects in science
fiction represent the intersection of categories of race, class, and
sexual orientation? In order to understand these question, it is
necessary to understand the study of Latin American science fiction, my
use of [queer theory to approach these questions, as well as the study
of race, gender, and sexuality in science fiction criticism in
general]{.underline}. I rely heavily on queer theorists' work on space
and time, and their connection to science fiction. One way to understand
queer lives is in terms of "sexual orientation." Sara Ahmed explores the
spatial component to orientation, as the word orientation implies
direction, the creation of space, and the relationship of people and
objects in that space (1). In phenomenology, it involves "intentional
consciousness," the direction of attention 5 towards certain objects and
away from others (27). Queer phenomenology, an idea I will return to in
Chapter 1, offers one lens to see queer space and time; it seeks to view
the way the world is oriented to privilege certain groups and exclude
others. Sexual orientation affects the way we inhabit and experience a
world already set before us, and thus understanding queer space can
offer a glimpse of how to configure the world to be more inclusive. By
analyzing queer spaces, we think outside the normative spaces created
for and by gender and sexuality. Halberstam seeks to modify "postmodern
geographies" to account for queer spaces and temporalities: Queer work
on sexuality has to respond to canonical work on postmodern geography by
Edward Soja, Frederic Jameson, and David Harvey and others that has
actively excluded sexuality as a category for analysis precisely because
desire has been cast by neo-Marxists as part of a ludic body politics
that obstructs the 'real' work of activism (6).1 Halberstam makes queer
lives central to questions about the creation of social space and class.
Halberstam asks us to think beyond epistemologies that exclude gender
and sexual orientation. By looking at these spaces, Halberstam and Ahmed
construct a discourse that includes queer lives in ways that are
sometimes overlooked. Doing so illuminates the presence of
subjectivities often ignored in hegemonic discourse, such as rural
queers or queer people of color. Opening up the category of queer to be
that which goes against the norm in more general terms, Ahmed
specifically allows us to think outside of the given spaces for things.
In terms of queer phenomenology, this means carving a space in 6
phenomenology for queer lives as well as queering the way we think about
inhabiting spaces already set before us. In other words, the world
privileges certain groups by creating patterns and social and physical
spaces that are more easily inhabited by some than others. Another
dimension to understand queer lives is in terms of time. [Queer
temporality creates not only space but time for queer
lives.]{.underline} Halberstam explains that there are "[queer"
subjectivities, such as HIV positive subjects or even the unemployed if
we use the term queer more broadly]{.underline}, [that go against
heterosexual logics of reproductive and family time]{.underline} (6).
These lives exist [outside the "normal]{.underline}" [capitalist schema
of marriage, children, labor, and longevity, and acquire value based on
other temporalities]{.underline}. Thus, [time and space can be analyzed
from a queer perspective]{.underline}. [Queer includes that which goes
against the norm,]{.underline} but also the sexual orientations
associated with the word queer[. As an inclusive not simply one but the
other, looking at queer subjectivities rather than simply identities
allows us to view queer lives from a multifaceted
perspective]{.underline} within restricting what does or does not
constitute the category such as a term like gay. Analysis of science
fiction texts goes hand in hand with an analysis of queer space and
time. [Science fiction texts help us to get a better view of the
structures of power that are frequently invisible; by creating new
worlds, new alien races, and alternate histories, the familiar is
rendered unfamilia]{.underline}r, [and the unfamiliar becomes
familiar]{.underline}. Darko Suvin theorizes that there is a relation
between the world of the reader and the science fictional setting that
is "estranged" to the reader in a process he calls "cognitive
estrangement" (12). Borrowing from Bertolt Brecht's examination of
vanguard theatre[, the idea is that 7 science fiction estranges the
familiar world of the reader t]{.underline}hrough a far-off time or
place (or differing future or past). Science fiction, [rather than
estranging the world of the reader to the point of
non-recognition]{.underline}, like surrealism, relies on tools of
cognition to understand the unfamiliar. [This frequently requires the
reader to engage with scientific principles that render the story
possible to the mind of the reader]{.underline}. [2 Science
fiction]{.underline} then, through means of cognitive estrangement[,
forces us to reckon with the norms of society, such as gender, race,
social hierarchies, and economic]{.underline} [inequalities. Science
fiction allows us to consider the reconstruction of gender as something
one does rather than something one has;]{.underline} Like the ideas
articulated by Ahmed and Halberstam, [science fictional time and space
is often queer time and space; alien bodies abstract notions of gender
to the reader]{.underline}. [The fictional space of science fiction
allows writers to test the limits of the body and particularly
gender]{.underline}.3 Judith Butler asks us in Undoing Gender to
[imagine a world beyond a gender binary: \"fantasy is essential to an
experience of one's own body or that of another, as
gendered]{.underline}" (15). Thus, [gender itself is created in space
and time]{.underline}, and in [the imagination as much as being
something one performs or does. Science fiction is a privileged site for
imaginary worlds and spaces]{.underline}, and can be [for the
reconceptualization of gender and sexuality as well]{.underline}.

[The introduction of geo-historical and bio-graphical configurations in
processes of knowing and understanding allows for a [radical
re-framing]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. de-colonization) [[of the original
formal apparatus of enunciation]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 I have been
supporting in the past those who maintain that [it is [not enough to
change the content of the conversation]{.mark}, that it is of the
essence to [change the terms]{.mark} of the conversation. Changing the
terms of the conversation implies [going beyond disciplinary]{.mark} or
interdisciplinary [controversies and the conflict of interpretations. As
far as controversies and interpretations remain within the same rules of
the game (]{.mark}terms of the conversation), [the control of knowledge
is not called into question]{.mark}. And in order to call into question
the modern/colonial foundation of the control of knowledge, it is
[necessary to focus on the knower]{.mark} rather than on the known. It
means to go to the very [assumptions that sustain locus
enunciations]{.mark}.]{.underline} In what follows I revisit the formal
apparatus of enunciation from the perspective of geo- and bio-graphic
politics of knowledge. My [revisiting is epistemic rather than
linguistic, although focusing on the enunciation is unavoidable if we
aim at changing the terms and not only the content of the
conversation]{.underline}. The basic assumption is that [the knower is
always implicated, geo- and body-politically, in the known,]{.underline}
although [modern epistemology]{.underline} (e.g. the hubris of the zero
point) managed to conceal both and [created the figure of the detached
observer, a neutral seeker of truth and objectivity who at the same time
controls the disciplinary rules and puts \[themself\] in a privileged
position to evaluate and dictate.]{.underline} The argument is
structured as follows. Sections I and II lay out the ground for the
politics of knowledge geo-historically and bio-graphically, contesting
the hegemony of zero point epistemology. In Section III, I explore three
cases in which geo- and body-politics of knowledge comes forcefully to
the fore: one from Africa, one from India and the third from New
Zealand. These three cases are complemented by a fourth from Latin
America: my argument is here. It is not the report of a detached
observer but the intervention of a de-colonial project that 'comes' from
South America, the Caribbean 4 Theory, Culture & Society 26(7--8) and
Latinidad in the US. Understanding the argument implies that the reader
will shift its geography of reasoning and of evaluating arguments. In
Section IV, I come back to geo- and body-politics of knowledge and their
epistemic, ethical and political consequences. In Section V, I attempt
to pull the strings together and weave my argument with the three cases
explored, hoping that what I say will not be taken as the report of a
detached observed but as the intervention of a de-colonial thinker. In
semiotics, a basic distinction has been made (Emile Benveniste) between
the enunciation and the enunciated. The distinction was necessary, for
Benveniste, to ground the floating sign central to Ferdinand de
Saussure's semiology and its development in French structuralism.
Benveniste turned to the enunciation and, by doing so, to the subject
producing and manipulating signs, rather than the structure of the sign
itself (the enunciated). With this distinction in mind, I would venture
to say that [the interrelated spheres of the colonial matrix of
power]{.underline} (economy, authority, gender and sexuality, and
knowledge/subjectivity[) operate at the level of the enunciated while
patriarchy and racism are grounded in the enunciation]{.underline}.
Let's explore it in more detail (Benveniste, 1970; Todorov, 1970).

Following an attempted military coup in Turkey on 15 July, 2016, a
country that was already being governed under a state of emergency
witnessed, through decree laws, the closure of pro-democratic NGO
publications, detentions, arrests, and the narrowing of permitted public
spaces. Thousands of academics and tens of thousands of public employees
were dismissed, while hundreds of association-based publications were
shut down. The members of the association Academics for Peace were fired
from their positions without first being prosecuted, and the presumption
of their innocence was ignored. Meanwhile, courses and theses on
critical theory, feminism, gender, LGBTQI+ and queer studies were
suddenly removed from university syllabi. Most academic research on
gender, LGBTQI+ and queer studies was disrupted, and with the dismissal
of academics who served as a bridge between academy and activism, social
movements' sphere of influence shrank even more. After all these losses,
it can be said that social opposition constituents were subjected to a
collective trauma. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and thousands of
opponents, journalists, human rights activists were denied their
freedom, detained and arrested. Moreover, the ability to imagine a
future democratic life was shattered. Ultimately, LGBTQI+ activities
were indefinitely banned in Turkey in November 2017 so as to include the
whole of Ankara and the Istanbul Beyoğlu district---which are also the
heart of LGBTQI+ activities, actions, and life. The governorship listed
'social sensitivities and sensibilities', 'public security', the
'protection of public health and morality' and the 'protection of
others' rights and liberties' as motivations for the ban on LGBTI+
activities. In announcing its decision, the government released the
following statements, republished in English on the Kaos GL website: We
were informed through various social media and several printed and
visual media organs that several movie, cinevision, theatre, panel,
interview, exhibition etc. events including several social sensibilities
and sensitivities will be organized in various locations of our city by
various non-governmental organizations in the name LGBTT (Lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transsexual, transvestite) and LGBTI (Lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, intersex). This situation was evaluated as that social
media shares at stake may provoke one section of public with different
social class, race, religion, sect and regional features to show hatred
and animosity in the disadvantage of other section, therefore clear and
imminent danger towards public safety may arise; also, considering that
this may jeopardize public order, prevention of crime, protection of
public health and morality, and protection of rights and liberties of
others; as a result of several social sensibilities there may occur
provocations and reactions by several sections towards groups and
individuals who want to attend intended event. (Kaos GL 2017b) [Just as
Kaos GL Association had organised the Future Queer exhibition in order
to launch a new public platform and space---one designed to create
breathing room following the 2015 bombings---the organisation decided to
stage innovative performance and unpredictable tactics]{.underline} in
2016, following the military coup attempt and after an ISIS plot to
target the Kaos GL association's offices was revealed. [These new
tactics had to be unpredictable, because the government was already
aware of almost every tool of traditional activism. It had assimilated
these tools and emptied all of the concepts that were meaningful for
activists' struggle.]{.underline} For instance, [cases that were opened
against those who encouraged attacks against LGBTQI+ people were
dismissed by concluding that the perpetrators had exercised their right
to freedom of speech,]{.underline} and that the state was obliged to
protect the people's right to freedom of speech, lest the police would
be asked to respond to every call in which the word LGBTI was
pronounced. Between 2017 and 2018, Kaos GL organised its second
contemporary art exhibition, entitled Colony4 within the borders of the
Fatih Municipality, in Sultan Ahmet Square. They chose it precisely
because it is situated within one of the most conservative regions of
Istanbul, and since there was no ban on LGBTQI+ events in the area.
Without specifically naming the organiser or using terms such as 'LGBTI'
in literature and without making any announcements in Kaos GL
publications, Colony spread through word-of-mouth and earto-ear as much
as silently, developing into a space of 4,000 square meters and an event
that included some thousand voices (Fig. 4). [In the age of the
Anthropocene, in which humans themselves have been revealed as a
geological force, and amid a climate of terrible uncertainty and fear
which is created by unmanned air vehicles and suicide bombers, Colony
set out to explore the possibilities of symbiosis, associations and
interspecies relationships between humans and non-humans--- even if the
desire of bio-genetic studies is to create the 'perfect'
human.]{.underline} The exhibition bulletin reads as follows: Fostered
by the globally immediate socio-political juncture, artistic production,
and academic discourse, Colony [brings the definition of 'human' into
question. Engaging critically with the means of making knowledge,
science, technology, and politics, the exhibition questions that which
privileges the human species by attributing a prioritised conception of
existence to mankind. Through the agency of intimating a body and
bodybeings, Colony gathers together artistic inquiries that reconsider
constructed dichotomies such as human/nonhuman, nature/culture, and
organic/ synthetic. Across moralism(s) and between female-male
morphologies fixed in procreation, Colony explores the constitutive ways
in which nature's sanctions of normativity operate.]{.underline}
Interfaced with discussions around language and gender, the exhibition
probes for contemporary (collective) bearings that evade
self-constituted, human-centered narratives derived from the alliance of
culture-historysociety-power. [Through the scope of post-human and queer
critique kinship, colony embodies a range of perspectives that discuss
these critical narratives.]{.underline}' (Colony exhibition bulletin
2017) In the Turkish landscape, institutional support for artists is
rare. Accordingly, following this exhibition, Kaos GL founded the Ankara
Queer Art Programme, considering processes of artistic production in
order to expand the limited opportunities for organising exhibitions and
make such initiatives sustainable. The International Guest Artist House
provides residencies for artists to work and live in Ankara for two
months at a time, and supports their research and artistic projects.
Today, while international travel remains risky due to the pandemic, the
programme is continuing to offer financial support to artists and
manages its consulting work online. Doing uncertain politics Over the
past few years, we have witnessed countries that invented globalisation
begin to adopt antiglobalisation policies, as right-wing, populist and
nationalist politics gained momentum. But the walls that states have
built up in order to protect themselves from immigration or free trade
do not protect them against the climate crisis or from terror. When
bombs started to arbitrarily explode in the streets of Ankara, the city
was shocked by the knowledge that the victims were completely random,
and shaken by the thought that anyone might become the victim of a
terror act anytime, anyplace. Those in the crowds who wore thicker
clothes than the seasonal norms, or those who ran away were not
protected from the bombs; similarly, individual measures taken against
the unpredictability that Covid-19 has created do not confer total
protection from the disease. The state of not knowing what will happen
no matter what one does has a horrific tendency to pacify individuals,
who are paralysed with worry. [Since the government knows by heart the
current tools and probable moves of the resistance, we need to devise
different tactics and exit the current 'cat and mouse' game. To respond
to a government who desires to monopolise the power of creating
uncertainty through governing that uncertainty, queer activism might
represent a way of doing uncertain politics: one that offers the
quickest and most effective responses against oppression.]{.underline}
For instance, [when officials told LGBTQI+ activists 'you can't gather
in Istanbul', we transformed numerous streets into spaces of action,
effectively saying 'Well then, we will spread out across the city'. When
they said 'You cannot walk beyond the barricade' in İzmir, we responded
by running back from the barricade.]{.underline} When they said 'You
cannot gather to protest in the streets' [we transformed the sea into a
space of action and activism by taking a ferry.]{.underline} My sense is
that [we can find some inspiration in such a movement with regards to
unpredictability. Traces of this form of activism can be observed
in]{.underline} the work of one of the artists featured in the Colony
exhibition (Abud Efendi Mansion, 2017-2018), Kerem Ozan Bayraktar. His
video, entitled 'Mimicry', focuses on the 'machineplant' relationship
(Fig. 5). The work, presenting footage from an orchid factory, reads
[the relationship between machines and plants as a symbiotic one. As in
the biological evolutionary processes through which the cultivated
orchids had been attracting]{.underline} bees in order to ensure their
reproduction, within this contemporary factory setting, orchids
'attract' the [machinery, namely the technological processes designed by
human beings. This type of relationality negates the common assumption
that the species that can sustain their existence through the
evolutionary process are the fittest ones]{.underline}; since the
orchids most capable of adapting to and cooperating with other species
are [constantly evolving and adapting enhance their survival
capabilities through enabling the machines that are integral to their
life cycles]{.underline}. Of course, the history of social movements can
give us an idea of who our possible future alliances will be. However,
[if we see the basis of activism as affirmation of life, these alliances
can change with every new situation encountered, like an orchid's
relationship to a machine]{.underline}. Else, the organic and inorganic
world, as well as the history of activism, can seduce the survival
strategies expected from our identities.

#### 2 \-- Ground determines the impact to predictable limits -- if they get substantial ground it zeroes their internal links to fairness and education -- we link to any tech engagement bad arguments, normative IR/institutions good, NATO good, alternative queer methodologies, progress good which generates competition for almost any politically oriented CP

#### 3 \-- \[EXTRA\] The negative's imposition of certainty is a technology of fascism that enables the exertion of interpersonal control as a proxy mechanism for dealing with the inherent unpredictability of the world -- unpredictability is a radical delegitimation of state power.

This article explores the [political and artistic potential of
'unpredictable' forms of activism]{.underline}: ones specifically
[devised in response to attacks]{.underline} on the Turkish LGBTQI+
movement [by right-wing populists]{.underline} within the AKP government
led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, especially since 2015. Reflecting
on the 2019 Conference in Marseilles at MUCEM---La Méditerranée du
genre, de la résistance et des stratégies (The Mediterranean of Gender,
Resistance and Strategies)---which spurred me to write the present
article, it strikes me that at the time of that event, the world had not
yet been tested with Covid-19. Although [the growing spectre of the
global climate crisis had already generated a significant sense of
uncertainty and insecurity, we were still unfamiliar with the experience
of our 'safe' realities and norms being swiftly swept away]{.underline}.
We could not yet conceive of a reality in which we would not be able to
hold the hand of our beloved at a funeral; or of the fact that our
health insurance would not protect us amid hospitals full to capacity.
Since the global pandemic swept the world, we have experienced the
(co)dependency of our bodies with a sense of horror---representing, for
the first time in modern history perhaps, such [a globally reaching
experience of radical uncertainty.]{.underline} Against all promises to
the contrary, we are witnessing, in the time of Covid, how international
bodies, states and institutions---no matter how ostensibly prepared they
had been---cannot fulfil their responsibilities in protecting the public
(or in certain cases prefer not to). [At a moment when we are confronted
with radical uncertainty,]{.underline} we are simultaneously facing the
fact that we often have little choice but to act individually against
collective risks. These individual actions include washing every surface
or object you may touch with disinfectants, covering your face with
masks even though public health authorities release contradictory and
shifting statements around their protective capacities, or regretting
your lack of good health insurance coverage and the precarious position
it puts you in if you do get ill. [From time to time, we become 'good
citizens' who demand the harshest penalties for those who do not wear
masks or disobey the rules of lockdown; or we establish a sense of
personal 'security']{.underline} by refusing access to our residential
buildings for those who do not have the privileged position to stay at
home, such as delivery people, service personnel and health
workers---[temporarily exerting a sense of control over our
environment]{.underline}. In short, even for overprivileged individuals
with excellent healthcare coverage, protected residences shielded from
the outside world, and the ability to stay safe at home during a
pandemic, all of us are confronted with radical unpredictability and
incalculable risk in this age of Anthropocene. Moreover, with the
challenges posed by neoliberalism---specifically the 2008 financial
crisis and the Syrian War, which both sent reverberations around the
world--- right-wing populism has gained significant influence and
political ground. As a way of doing politics, right-wing populism is
noteworthy for its hybridity and adoption of uncertainty as a form of
governing. It is hybrid because there is little consistency between the
right-wing populist, charismatic leaders currently heading several
countries around the globe---from Orbán to Bolsonaro and Trump---and the
economic, political, judicial, scientific, philosophical, religious,
moral and aesthetic ideologies and policies they represent and promote.
For instance, while liberal values are adopted in some economic
decisions, social rights might be accompanied by conservatism,
pro-immigration policies by nationalism (and from time to time, even
fascism). What is significant here is that while [this ideological
hybridity is not perceived as a negative trait by populist governments,
which arguably thrive on inconsistency, it has an unpredictable power
over citizens, because we do not know how such leaders will behave nor
what they will do next.]{.underline} In The Anthropology of the State,
Marc Abélès (2012) suggests that [in order to legitimise political power
under the law of reason, classical political philosophy differentiates
between two conditions, natural and civic]{.underline}: On the one hand,
there is a natural condition in which individuals are left to their own
devices and this leads to an anarchical positioning. On the other hand,
there is a civic condition emanating from the contract. In a literal
sense, a political bond occurs only in the latter. Also, what conditions
the existence and pérennité of the political bond is represented with
its dual qualification in the forms of bringing together and
empowerment. (p. 20) Thus, [in order to remove the difficulties people
face living in a lawless environment in which chaos dominates, the state
will claim to bring fair, universal social solutions, which will
determine the grounds of its legitimate power.]{.underline} Of course,
this duality has been questioned in many instances and respects. For
example, it can be said that the central objective of much research in
political anthropology is to question this dichotomy established between
the state and what supposedly existed prior to its formation. However,
[in the contemporary and neoliberal era, this duality has been blurred
by the state itself, which instead opts for a mode of governing that
fosters deep uncertainty.]{.underline} Even within the social sciences,
[the dualities generated by modern states, which are also legal
entities, can be described in these terms: normal and abnormal, legal
and illegal, permitted and unpermitted, public and private, etc. We
witness how the lines between them change place arbitrarily, or become
uncertain through government policy.]{.underline} Thus, [when the
distinction between what determines 'normal' and 'outside of the norm'
suddenly become meaningless, not only are the laws of science that
indicate the norm---which we can think of as something that repeats
itself, or as rules---suspended, but so is the logic of law, on which
states and governments are based]{.underline}. While the Enlightenment
and its heritage has served as a common reference point for centuries,
its notion of human rights is annihilated when the law itself is used as
a tool for human rights violations.

In the last decade, a powerful voice has emerged in social theory from
its origins in cultural studies and discourse analysis. Loosely gathered
under the label queer theory, this body of work has introduced
substantial challenges not only to the heteronormativity of most social
theory but also to the ways feminism, gay and lesbian studies, and
analyses of inequality in general, have implicitly reproduced
essentialist notions of identity and consciousness, thus constructed
limits to their own subversive potential. Queer theory is less a
homogeneous, coherent school of thought than a dialogue across
disciplines that seeks to multiply the questions asked by social
analysis. Emerging from more general trends toward deconstruction
associated with poststructuralist thought, it takes as its starting
point the social construction of apparently fixed identities, the
reliance of such identities on presumed binary oppositions of difference
which inhere in them, and the always unstable, always partial hegemonies
of 'the normal' in real human life. In Seidman's words "identities are
always multiple or at best composites, with an infinite number of ways
in which "identity components" . . . can intersect or combine. Any
specific identity construction, moreover, is arbitrary, unstable, and
exclusionary" (Seidman 1994, 173). Not only do constructions of identity
always entail constructions of their opposite but, because those
opposites are ideal-typical poles, they also produce unintended gaps on
the continuum between them. And it is not so much in the recognition or
affirmation of the 'Other' as here, on the multiple and shifting terrain
between identities (i.e., the in-betweens of gender, race, and
sexuality), that the potential lies for subverting essentialism
altogether (Butler 1990; Seidman 1994, 173). This, then, is also where
[the importance of queer theory lies---not so much in the particulars of
its diverse analyses of discourse, culture, theory, or law, but in its
insistence upon the subversion of apparently dichotomous relationships
rather than simply their inversion or recognition]{.underline} (Namaste
1994, 230). [Such an analytic focus has significant implications
for]{.underline} our understanding of, and political engagement with,
relations of domination and resistance, including [class
relations.]{.underline} In fact, I would suggest that [queer theory does
for our understanding of identity struggle what Marx did for our
understanding of economic struggle--- historicizing its assumptions,
identifying its subversions, articulating its alwaysalready existing
potentials]{.underline}. And in doing these, it [provides an opportunity
to engage the relations of capital and class not as a set of immediately
conquerable institutions but as a complex of ongoing relationships which
is continually challenged, reconfigured and reinforced through the daily
interactions of individuals and collectives]{.underline} (Namaste 1994,
224). How it does this, and [the implications of that strategy for
political class struggle, can be seen in the questions queer theory asks
of more traditional approaches to gender inequality and
heteronormativity, and the alternative political approaches those
questions engender.]{.underline} Building on its roots in
poststructuralism, queer theory interrogates not only the marginalized
Others of social norms, but the dynamic and ever-shifting relationship
between the poles; that is, rather than emphasizing the invisibility of
women in patriarchy or of gays and lesbians in heteronormativity, the
role those Others play is examined as always-already interior to the
normal (Namaste 1994, 222). [This is much more than a philosophical or
discursive exercise, as too many Marxists are quick to
assert---stressing the relational puts front and center the questions of
interaction, of contestation, and of resistance]{.underline}. It implies
that the binarisms upon which so much of identity is constructed cannot
be preexisting, that neither pole in a dichotomy can be primary or
natural, and that the formation, location, and interaction of such
'opposites' are the very substance of their continued reproduction. And
if that is the case, [resistance and alternatives become that much
easier to locate as well, for three reasons: the recognition of identity
as plural opens space for subversion]{.underline}, which can potentially
include distinct and even apparently antagonistic groups; t[he emphasis
on constructedness reveals that so-called normative
identities]{.underline} (i.e., white, heterosexual, middle class)
[are]{.underline} no less [unstable]{.underline} and partial than
marginal ones, despite the significant privilege attached to them; and
antagonism can never be rooted in immutable characteristics but must
always and everywhere be located in existing relationships and the
political strategies people employ to negotiate and renegotiate those
relationships (Namaste 1994, 225). All this puts [queer theory in marked
contrast to more traditional approaches to social
inequality]{.underline}, even those which sought radical political
change. For example, previous theories of feminist and sexual liberation
often tended to reproduce rather than subvert essentialism and binarism
by opposing a unitary, victimized subject to a hegemonic norm, whether
defined as male, heterosexual, or both. This can be seen in a wide range
of politically motivated, even 'revolutionary' work, from radical
feminism's celebration of womanhood and privileging of lesbianism, and
Dworkin and MacKinnon's construction of an all-encompassing, inherently
oppressive male sexuality, to Kristeva and Wittig's searches for origins
and even Wilkinson and Kitzinger's arguments for political and
identitarian unity in gay liberation struggles (Butler 1990; Bell 1994;
Ingraham 1994, 213--5; Seidman 1994, 170; Wilkinson and Kitzinger 1994).
In each case, patriarchy and heterosexuality remain constructed as
universal and as intact; even where their naturally occurring status is
called into question, they are seen as constructed upon real biological
difference or imperative. Thus the hegemony of heterogender (Ingraham
1994, 204) is taken as a preexisting fact, rather than a recurrent
tension, and the only possibilities for resistance are formal equality
within existing parameters or inversion (but continued maintenance) of
the hierarchy. By critiquing the tendency of much feminist and gay
liberationist work to reproduce binarism, [queer theory attempts to
accomplish a rethinking]{.underline} akin to that brought about by
postcolonial and black feminist thought in regard to assumed norms of
whiteness---[to promote a politically meaningful solidarity not on the
basis of inherent sameness, but of constructed difference, not on the
assumption of permanent, fixed identities but on fluid, partial, and
contingent notions of selfhood and alliance which acknowledge multiple,
intersecting relationships]{.underline}.1 Such a perspective
[may]{.underline} at first glance [appear contradictory to the formation
of political class solidarity in that it deemphasizes points of
commonality, but on deeper examination, what appears is not a rejection
of solidarity but a different conception of it. The point of commonality
is]{.underline} not a universal sameness of oppression, not an
unbesmirched essence buried beneath learned behavior, but the fact that
we all share [the experience of living with hierarchy-based identities,
that we all experience only partial and unstable adjustment to
identitarian regulations]{.underline}, albeit in different and even
contradictory ways (see, for example, Wright 1997), and that all
identities are at best incomplete, complex, and transitory. [The
resultant solidarity, then, is not one of a taken-for-granted unity or a
presumed shared utopia, but rather a strategic solidarity]{.underline}
which sees the sexual/ gender/race/class landscape itself, rather than
any one, identifiable position on that landscape, as the common enemy.
This, in turn, [opens space for a plurality of resistances which can be
seen not as competing but as mutually supporting, and provides for the
possibility of alliance across sectoral divides.]{.underline} All this
presupposes a very different approach to political struggle than we have
been accustomed to. The broadly defined Left---be it feminist,
[Marxist,]{.underline} gay libera tionist, or nationalist---[has tended
to ground its political strategies and end goals in terms of an easily
identifiable opponent: the class war rages between capitalists and
workers]{.underline}; the feminist struggle between men and women; the
sexual liberation struggle between straights and gays and lesbians; the
antiracist struggle between racists and nonracists, as though real human
relationships ever correspond neatly to such idealtypical poles. And
while such oppositional organizing offered a means of establishing
political community and articulating the value of alternative knowledges
and alternative ways of living, in each case what was [taken for the
enemy was an embodied product of the system]{.underline} rather than the
relational system itself.2 That is, [the relation capital produces
capitalists and workers, as though these were ahistoric, unchanging and
easily identified categories;]{.underline} the gender system produces
men and women, as though individuals were a necessarily wholly or
permanently one or the other; the racialization process produces whites
and blacks, as though these were somehow natural and timeless
categories, rather than shorthand for a vast and ever growing range of
miscegenations and racial and cultural identities. In each case,
however, these presumed dichotomies are, in real human relationships,
only-ever partial, can only be defined contextually, and are subject to
constant redefinition. [What needs to be analyzed and targeted
politically, then, is not the individuals associated with various
positions within such relational systems, but the systems
themselves.]{.underline} Individuals are socially located not due to any
essential characteristic which inheres to them, but due to their
positioning within relationships and their roles in either reinforcing
or subverting relations of domination. Rather than a retreat from
conflict, then, the emphasis on relationships and systems helps to focus
the object of struggle more clearly, to engage class, gender,
heteronormativity, and racialization as processes of social reproduction
rather than always-already existing states of being. What is more, [it
can accomplish these without either denying identity's political
relevance, as so many Marxists tend to do, or obscuring the play of
structure, of material life, of laboring practices in seemingly
'nonclass' struggles, as is too often common in poststructuralist
analyses.]{.underline} The emphasis on process and relationship is
particularly well articulated by Judith Butler, for whom the starting
point of analysis is a Nietzschean distinction between 'doer' and
'deed'. [This acknowledgement that identities and institutions are
products of social interaction rather than preexisting states requires
that we maintain an analytic and political focus on the ways that social
relationships are produced and reproduced, on how they are constituted
through their ongoing performance;]{.underline} "there need not be a
'doer behind the deed', but . . . the 'doer' is invariably constructed
in and through the deed" (Butler 1990, 142). [It is human action and
interaction which is primary; thus, the political field is made more
open to the subversion of normalcy and the multiplication of alternative
potentials]{.underline}. Thus, while the political usefulness of
Butler's own work is limited by its focus on discursive production and
individual interaction to the exclu sion of class struggles and laboring
practices (Hennessy 1996, 225--8), her presentation of the problem has
important implications for materialist, class-oriented analyses.3
[Indeed, what are material institutions but the long-term and
presumed-immutable outcomes of a previous relationships? What are
'structural barriers' but the concrete material implications of 'doing'
or 'performing' social life according to culturally, politically,
economically, militarily enforced rules of interaction?]{.underline}
Thus it is here that we come to [the concrete, political significance of
queer theory for class struggles and for alternative ways of living: the
queer theory approach provides an alternative set of questions which
emphasize not only individuals in social relationships, but the
production and reproduction of those relationships themselves, and the
always existing gaps and breaks in social systems]{.underline}. When
articulated with reference to concrete, material outcomes of
relationships, queer theory emphasizes [the production of alternative
alliances and strategies which engage the reproduction of inequality as
social process rather than as hegemonic entity, and provokes a political
strategy in which liberation is not something 'found', but is achieved
through ongoing processes of struggle, of solidarity in difference, and
of relationship building.]{.underline} Queer theory, then, is not only
or even primarily about understanding sexual diversity, but represents a
significantly different approach to political analysis, and one which
[holds enormous potential for class analysts and class movements which
seek an alternative to the legacy of Second and Third International
Marxist-Leninist orthodoxies.]{.underline} It is an alternative way of
thinking about social relationships which emphasizes process rather than
product, subversive potential rather than end goal. Its implications for
class analysis and political class struggle are to be found in the way
it constructs domination and resistance as dynamic, as relational, as
potential. Process and relationship become the central concerns not only
of analysis, but of struggle as well, so that [subversion is something
to be uncovered and exploded, rather than implanted and left to fight a
war of attrition for some always promised yet never attained state of
bliss.]{.underline}

#### 2 \-- Queer Marxism DA -- queer engagement with Marxist utopian imaginaries grounds their movement in embodied queer/trans histories that foreground capitalist accumulation, exploitation, and alienation -- class analysis is inseparable from the reproduction of social identity.

[Queer theory engaging with Marxism has reinvigorated key Marxist
concepts by grounding theories of sexuality and queer and trans
histories, cultures and texts into histories and readings of capitalist
social transformation and accumulation.]{.underline} This includes the
Marxist concepts of the [commodity, value, labour, the gendered and
racial division of labour, totality, reification, surplus population,
primitive accumulation, racial capitalism, crisis, history and
capital.]{.underline} These concepts have been engaged with to varying
degrees of detail and Marxist orthodoxy, by drawing from different eras
in Marx's (and Marxist) thought -- at times from the optimistic Young
Marx of the 1844 Philosophic and Economic Manuscripts (1959), from the
revolutionary Marx and Engels of The German Ideology and The Communist
Manifesto, from the Marx of Capital. Queer Marxists also draw strongly
from twentieth century Marxist figures such as Georg Lukaçs, Walter
Benjamin, Ernst Bloch and C.L.R. James. As I detail in Chapter 1,
Gayatri Spivak's reading of Marx's labour theory of value (1988) has a
profound influence on queer Marxism's conception of value. Furthermore,
while often not directly cited, the strong influence of Louis
Althusser's critique of ideology (1971) is evident in some contributions
(Ferguson 2004, Liu 2015). The aforementioned Marxist concepts have been
[studied and applied to deepen important current subjects within queer
theory, including the history of sexuality, utopia (of course also a
subject of Marxism), affect, queer of colour critique and race,
embodiment, gender, activism, and the political economy of sexuality
more broadl]{.underline}y. For instance, the influential work of Floyd
(2009) and Hennessy (2000) connects the transformations of discourses of
sexuality (of sexology and psychoanalysis) in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth century with developments in capitalist production and
consumption. Hennessy and Floyd deploy Georg Lukács' theory of
reification (1971), a touchstone for the development of Western Marxism
in the interwar period, to theorise the reification of sexual
subjectivity and sexual desire (I discuss this work at length in Chapter
1). The variation in Marxist orthodoxy has had a positive influence on
the development of queer Marxism within queer theory, allowing for
heterogeneity in critical and theoretical approaches in the uptake of
Marxist concepts. Indeed, as Floyd writes, [queer Marxism pushes Marxism
"to speak to certain dimensions in social and historical reality
powerfully illuminated in queer theory's relatively brief history,
dimensions that Marxism has little history of
acknowledging,]{.underline} much less examining" (2009: 2, 4). The
endeavour to [challenge he epistemological limits of Marxism has been
particularly fruitful in the development and uptake of queer of colour
critique as a mode of analysis,]{.underline} as I discuss below.
However, queer Marxisms have at times foregone structural critique that
connects queer life and culture to political economy and the critique of
capital. In addition, the muted engagement between queer Marxisms
themselves seems to have had an adverse effect on the theoretical
consistency of, and collaboration within, the discipline. For instance,
addressing early work by Floyd (1996), Hennessy highlights the lack of
"studies that examine the historical relationship between the formation
of new sexual identities and the reifying cultural logic of an emergent
commodity culture" (2000: 97). This is the key thesis of Floyd's The
Reification of Desire (2009), which undertakes a detailed queer reading
of Lukács as I detail in Chapter 1. However, Floyd's text only minimally
attends to the important queer Marxist work of Hennessy (2000), Joseph
(2002), Tinkcom (2002) and Ferguson (2004).16 Such a lack of engagement
with other queer Marxist texts has undoubtedly affected the development
of the field within queer theory. An example of the theoretical
heterogeneity of queer Marxism is found in the roundtable discussion
'Queer studies, materialism, and crisis' in the GLQ special issue
(Crosby et al. 2012). The discussion pays particular attention to [queer
Marxism's "orientation to political-economic questions" (127), utopia
and totality, racial capitalism and capital's need to make certain
bodies disposable in its pursuit of accumulation.]{.underline} The
discussion brings together prominent contributors to queer Marxism and
queer theorists addressing class and queer liberalism. Floyd explicitly
historicises the uptake of certain concepts in queer theory, such as
utopia in the work of Muñoz (2009) and Edelman (2004), as "symptomatic
of a moment in which [capital's colonization of the future appears both
unassailable, as a familiar neoliberal narrative would have it \[...
and\] transparently violent in a way that may suggest the opposite:
accumulation's radical fragility]{.underline}" (Crosby et al. 2012:
128). On this point, he emphasises that [Marxism and queer studies
arrive at the same conclusions]{.underline}. Furthermore, building upon
his reconsideration of totality in The Reification of Desire, Floyd asks
"Can one 're-pos\[e\] the question of totality' without implicating
oneself in an imperial, American universalism?", and while gesturing
towards Marx's value-form highlights the "problem of [grasping the ways
in which capitalism's gendered, racialized and sexualized violence is
inseparable from ... capitalism's simultaneous identity and nonidentity
with itself]{.underline}" (138, emphasis added). Two contributors
strongly emphasise the relationship between capitalism, racialization
and queer studies' address of marginalised figures and groups. Lisa
Rofel emphasises the [importance of a queer hermeneutics for
understanding capitalism's drive for universality across "Euro-American
metropoles" which is "undone by the 'difference'" of the history of the
"postcolonies", and for understanding the relation between the value
form, bodies and the value of marginalised lives]{.underline} (129). On
the subject of racial capitalism, Fred Moten emphasises, citing Cedric
Robinson (1983), the centrality of "racism not as capitalism's
instrument but as its conditions of possibility", alongside the role of
"regulative desire" in the pursuit of capitalist accumulation (130).
Robert McRuer emphasises [queer theory's interest in "provid\[ing\] some
account of capitalist modernity, neoliberalism, or globalization" must
necessarily address "the invalidated and unthinkable",]{.underline} crip
"figures that are sick, infected, deranged, addicted, scarred, wounded,
or traumatized" (131). He notes that queer Marxism must remain invested
in crip and Mad bodies and lives (as I consider in Chapter 4). Dean
Spade's contributions describe the pain of the NGO-industrial-complex's
"eclipse" of grassroots LGBT activism, which has transformed queer
politics into "a site for building white power" (135) through carceral
regimes and non-redistributive equality politics, and highlights the
importance of a critical trans politics that cognises "the material
conditions of existence and the distribution of life chances" (143). In
contrast to these approaches that connect the structural forces of
capitalism globally to contemporary narratives of development, the
transformation of queer politics by capital, and the situation of
marginal queer lives within these contexts, Heather Love details her
interest in working-class queer writing, sometimes by writers of colour,
which "focuses on [the lived experience of structural
inequality]{.underline}" (131). For Love, this work however decentres
its focus on capital and "can seem to lack a revolutionary horizon"
(131). She emphasises that "this [refusal of the choice between
revolution and capitulation is what makes this tradition
queer".]{.underline} 17 Love's pessimism seems to miss the potential of
reading or theorising such lived experience into materials and
ammunition of queer Marxism.

[[Queer theory]{.mark}, even as elaborated by authors closely identified
as arguing in favor of a radical linguistic constructivism**, [turns out
to be a materialist theory of social structuration with affinities to
Marxism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Queer theory does not argue that
identity is fluid, mobile, definitionless, or freely chosen; rather, it
shows that identity is produced by constraints, social norms, and other
specters of the material beyond one's knowledge and agency. **[Insofar
as [both]{.mark} queer theory and Marxism [emphasize]{.mark} such
primary [ties to unknown Others as a source of human
vulnerability]{.mark} as well as sociality, [both are committed to a
materialism]{.mark} even when the material remains unnamed,
unidentified, or reduced to a spectral presence.]{.underline}** The
[point of material analysis is not to reassert the priority of the
economic but to show that questions of gender and sexuality are part of
a matrix of social interdependence that connects the self to others
beyond borders---geopolitical, ethnolinguistic, religious, or
otherwise.]{.underline} These [others may speak different languages,
inhabit any kind of socioeconomic organization, and subscribe to a
variety of cultural beliefs and customs. Hence, there is no reason to
assume that a material analysis must begin with American capitalism,
free wage labor, or class relations.]{.underline} Instead, **[a
genuinely [materialist analysis must look beyond the borders of the
nation and provincialize US queer theory and Marxism as mere
participants in a global conversation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [While
both queer theory and Marxism have largely relied on philosophical
notions of ethical alterity to argue this point, philosophy can get us
only so far. It is imperative for us as a field to move past
philosophical questions of the Other in Kant, Hegel, or Levinas and
begin seriously engaging the scholarship produced by the "actually
existing others]{.underline}." [The kind of work that we read, produce,
recognize, and disseminate as queer theory is all but one variant of a
global discourse---there are many queer theories in the world that are
generating valuable insights from different archives and social
formations]{.underline}. Rather than asking whether queer theory is
translatable or applicable to non-Western societies, we need to learn
from their academic work and participate in international and
translingual conversations. This move is logically demanded by the
question of the material. My analysis of the material in queer theory
and Marxism aims to show that the [reduction of Marxism to an economic
doctrine and the subsequent characterization of queer theory as its
culturalist corrective reflect the provincialism of US multiculturalist
politics]{.underline}. In the United States, the **[liberal-pluralist
paradigm continues to be the primary language for progressive social
policies, which has produced a deeply entrenched impression that the
primary obstacle facing queer people is discrimination, mis-
recognition, or other forms of mental judgment that impede parity in
participation.]{.underline}** Seeing the LGBTQIA+ "issue" as a battle
against discriminatory attitudes and patterns of evaluation, critics
believe that the proper remedy is the promotion of "diversity and
inclusion" in the workplace or education. What the language of diversity
and inclusion leaves out, of course, is the critique and analysis of the
historical processes that authorized certain individuals to decide whom
to include, tolerate, and accept in the first place. The implicit
message to queer and other oppressed people is that, instead of
questioning and demanding fundamental changes in the existing relations
of power, they can rely on the good will of enlightened individuals in
positions of power to bring about social change. The [liberal-pluralist
language of diversity and inclusion presents a reformist strategy to
assimilate the disenfranchised into the national polity in accordance
with mainstream views, instead of a transformative strategy that
reconfigures relationships of power and expands the field of gender
possibilities]{.underline}. A materialist methodology is a timely
response at this critical juncture to counter the liberal-pluralist
ideology that gender and sexual minorities only suffer from prejudices
or invisibility. **[[With materialist theories like Marxism and]{.mark}
a rehabilitated [queer theory, we can move past]{.mark} the
[fantasy]{.mark} [that]{.mark} formal [legal equality is all we need to
eliminate oppression]{.mark} around the world. Though [queer
theory]{.mark} is haunted by the material, it has also [necessitated a
rethinking of the material.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### 1 \-- The aff solves it \-- queer technological engagement infects the capitalist machine of commodification and consumerist desire and "collapses the grid" of neoliberalism

[[Queer Technologies proposes a queer grid]{.mark}. If the virus is life
exploiting life, Queer Technologies' formation of a grid calls for an
exploitation of the queer self to manufacture difference, that is, to
combat the dominant viral GRID of homosexuality, a queer grid must
replicate and mutate the dominant never-being-thesameness to produce its
own queer never-being-the sameness]{.underline}. **[Queer Technologies
aligns with Alan Liu's notion of "destructive creativity"---a creativity
that goes "beyond the new picturesque of mutation and mixing to the
ultimate form of such mutation and mixing: what may be called the new
sublime of 'destruction.' \[. . .\] the critical inverse of the
mainstream ideology of creative destruction \[. . . a\] viral
aesthetics]{.underline}**."\[14\] This aesthetics becomes like a
repetitive stream of disidentifications---[disidentifying as queer
cryptography, **repetitively infecting the infections of mainstream
ideology at the risk of obliterating one's own "hygiene**]{.underline}."
Queer Technologies locates the potential of such an aesthetic viral
infection in queer affect. [Queer affect as a type of
cryptography\--nonhygienic ways of being, living, experiencing\--
**generates a life-resistance that, in its contingencies, mutations, and
infections with global capital, produces another queer, viral grid that
is an "illegible and incalculable" artificial life to GRID, as it is
always forming its life in relation/exploitation to this dominant
GRID**]{.underline}. A queer GRID is mapped through the potential of
relationalities and affects generated in a Queer Technologies event,
situated within the context of the encounter between the body in contact
and the autonomy of the technological product. The affective encounter
holds the potential to explode out into a queer collective force. To
diagram this reveals the topological possibilities for queer
world-making on and off GRID.: the queer grid is both visible and
invisible. **[Queer Technologies identifies these material practices as
queer capitalism. If, [in viral capitalism]{.mark}, [the commodity is
the virus, Queer Technologies]{.mark} produces and [manufactures its
own]{.mark} line of commodities as political products [to infect the
desiring-product logic]{.mark} of GRID that constitutes the
biosocialities of homosexuality]{.underline}**. [Queer Technologies
refers to its products as gay bombs]{.underline}. [Appropriating the
mid-90s US Air Force proposal for the development of a biochemical
weapon that would turn combatants of war gay, gay bombs, as queer
political products circulating in GRID, explodes and infects GRID's
viral logic]{.underline}. Simply put, **[the circulation of Queer
Technologies must exploit capital]{.underline}**. Queer Technologies
executes this [through]{.underline} a variety of tactics: **[shop
dropping, barcode manipulation, price based on cultural institute of
dissemination, e-business scams, free giveaways at rallies, and fake
tech support centers.]{.underline}** [Queer Technologies has commenced
developing sets of maps and battle plans that are referred to as GRID.
Queer Technologies uses the same name for its own queer grids as well as
the dominant GRID to virally bind them linguistically and
etymologically, in that Gay-Related Immune Deficiencty
(G.R.I.D.)]{.underline} is always left as a trace (an infection) within
the term "grid." [As Queer Technologies circulates within various cities
and geographical areas, at sites such as Target, Best Buy, Circuit City,
RadioShack, Wal-Mart, Borders, Barnes & Noble, Apple, and other places
of technological consumption, Queer Technologies diagrams and situates
these products\--gay bombs\--within a grided structure.]{.underline}
These queer grids, once mapped out, are distributed all over the areas
they correlate to: on billboards, sidewalks, signposts, websites, store
fronts, etc. Akin to a Situationist dérive, these queer grids attempt to
restructure the replications of homosexuality virally produced by GRID.
[Queer Technologies' grid project fashions a new topology: these
circulated diagrams and situated products in various consumer outlets
work toward producing another type of virality that emerges from the
fusion of map and territory\--viral in that it uses the same logic of
viral capitalism: **[the queer grid]{.mark} allows itself to [constantly
change and mutate with the dominant GRID]{.mark} [to continuously infect
capital]{.mark}; it is its own mutation [engine]{.mark} [that produces
queer never-being-the-sameness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[The queer grid
will crash, succeed, re-chart, change always, replicate always. [Its
value lies within]{.mark} the fact that [each]{.mark} node in the
topology\--as a [gay bomb]{.mark}- -has the potential to [explode into a
queer relationality]{.mark}, encrypted by another grid, [that]{.mark}
can [generate a whole new set of infections]{.mark} against
GRID.]{.underline}** Queer Technologies, through all its various
tactics\--broadly defined as viral aesthetics, infects GRID with another
grid[. Perhaps these escapings from GRID are momentary, fleeting, but
they continue undoubtedly. Escaping the face, the representation, the
image, the formation that infects the biosocialities of homosexuality
generates the potential for a new viral logic of new queer biosocial
formations, a new monstrosity of the homosexual flesh. Queer
Technologies calls this flesh theSoftQueerBody---a social, artificial
flesh, a materialism of everything, infected as queer.]{.underline}

#### 2 \-- Futurism DA \-- the alternative relies on a hetero-prophetic trajectory of progress that relapses into the universalizing institutional politics of cisheteronormativity -- refuse the logic of programmatic future-making and instead turn inward to acts of micropolitical resistance.

**Giffney 8** (Noreen Giffney, Proffessor at University College Dublin
Ireland, "Queer Apocal(o)ptic/ism: The Death Drive and the Human,"
Published in "Queering the Non/Human, 2008, pp 64)

[Reproductive [futurism imposes]{.mark},]{.underline} according to
Edelman, [\'an **ideological [limit on political]{.mark} discourse** as
such, [preserving]{.mark} in die process the **absolute [privilege of
heteronormativity]{.mark}** [by **rendering**
]{.mark}**unthinkable**]{.underline}, by casting outside the political
domain, [the possibility of a **[queer resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}
to this organizing principle of communal relations\' (2). [Reproductive
futurism **absorbs all challenges** and **translates them into more of
the same**.]{.underline} It operates in a similar way to Monique
Wittig\'s concept of the straight mind in that \'when thought of by the
straight mind, homosexuality is nothing but heterosexuality\' (1992,28).
[Reproductive futurism is a more specific term than heteronormativity in
that [it describes]{.mark} the [process through which heterosexuality
becomes heteronormative]{.mark}. Heteronormativity is thus a term to
describe a conglomerate of effects while reproductive futurism signifies
the process through which such effects are wrought.]{.underline} It is
all-encompassing, operating at the level of ideology so that it sets
limits on, not just what we think or do, but also on what and how we
desire. Desire itself becomes reproductive futurism in its \'translation
into a narrative\', [[\'its]{.mark} teleological
[determination\']{.mark} through politics which [\'conforms to]{.mark}
the [temporality of desire\']{.mark}, \'the inevitable historicity of
desire\']{.underline} (Edelman 2004, 9). [Reproductive futurism
is]{.underline}, what I call,
[[\'heterocycloptic\']{.underline}]{.mark}, [[bound up with]{.mark} the
desiring gaze and [the setting-out of]{.mark} **a [developmental
trajectory of]{.mark} [\'progress\']{.mark} [moving]{.mark} endlessly
[towards a \'better\' future]{.mark}**, in the process [imposing a
panopticon]{.mark}]{.underline} ¬like self-surveillance: [\'It\'s a
machine in which everyone is caught, those who exercise power just as
much as those over whom it is exercised]{.underline}\' (Foucault 1980,
156). [[It is apocalyptic]{.mark} in the sense that **[desire]{.mark}
itself [becomes a trap]{.mark}**, a **disciplining device** in which
**the norm becomes inextricable from the natural**. This technology of
power --- a **[\'coercive universalization\']{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Edelman 2004, 11) operates at the level of fantasy and through the
figure of the Child: [[\'the]{.mark} [Child]{.mark} has come to
[embody]{.mark} for us [the **telos of the social order**]{.mark} and
come to be seen as the one for whom that]{.underline} [order is held in
perpetual trust\']{.underline} (11). In this, the Child becomes
inextricably linked to the future and in turn to politics, and is thus
reduced to a trope delimiting what will get to count as the future in
advance. [Reproductive [futurism]{.mark}]{.underline} I believe
[**[exercises power contradictorily]{.mark}** through a **web**, a
**net**, a **grid**. It encourages]{.underline}, perhaps
contradictorily, [the proliferation of desires - **[a looking-out as
opposed to a gazing-within]{.mark}** - [in]{.mark} the [service of
**repressing any conscious self-awareness of**]{.mark} **the [death
driv]{.mark}e**]{.underline}. [Reproductive [futurism]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} therefore, what I term, **[\'hetero-prophetic\']{.mark}** in
that [it tries to set out **programmatically** what will **transpire in
the future**]{.mark}; a **future [\'endlessly
postponed\']{.mark}**]{.underline} (13), [[thus]{.mark} **[holding the
present to ransom]{.mark}**. If it is invested in eschatology, it is
only as a veneer to discipline those into enslavement to its
ideals.]{.underline}

#### 3 \-- Conformity DA -- communist organizing inevitably excludes and silences queer members by forcing them to conform to their ideal vision of the proletariat. Communist movements have historically been homophobic and claimed that being lesbian arises from unjustified hostilities to men and was an example of developing a lifestyle under capitalism. Don't let them get away with just saying "not us"; multiple examples of communist movements being exclusionary, and their alt doesn't do anything to actively include queer people.

[Much has been written about the Revolutionary Communist [Party]{.mark}
and its [ban]{.mark} on [gay people]{.mark} within its ranks. Some of us
are familiar with the specific [anti-gay rationalizations]{.mark} the
[RCP promoted for thirty years]{.mark} -- including its notorious
[argu]{.mark}ment that [same-sex attrac- tions are a politically
reactionary, personal-ideological choice]{.mark}.]{.underline} [But what
was going on within the RCP was not just a stubborn and arrogant "error
of line"-- [it was]{.mark} also [an actual practice that had an impact
on real people and real struggle.]{.mark} That is what I want to write
about, including what it was like to [live "in the closet" inside a
communist organization]{.mark}. I want to talk about what it was like to
be attracted to the dream of revolution -- and then be told that my
lesbian feelings were ideologically part of a corrupt and oppressive
world order, and that I force myself to have sexual relationships with
men in an effort to develop the sexual feelings I was told I was
supposed to have, as part of being a revolutionary.]{.underline} I want
to talk about the way decent [but incredibly ignorant communist com-
rades were instructed to correct me, my feelings, and my
behaviors]{.underline}. And how, [within a movement hoping to carry out
liberation, the awful [arguments and pressures of anti-gay bigotry were
reproduced and enforced]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[RCP]{.mark} cadre and
[leaders]{.mark} looked people like me in the eyes and [told us to
change, conform and be silent --- or else get out]{.mark}. [At the
height of the AIDS crisis,]{.mark} [they]{.mark} knowingly [opened
a]{.mark} horrible [split between com- munist activists and]{.mark}
[those fighting rightwing attacks on gay people]{.mark}. They reproduced
within revolutionary ranks (and using "communist" rhetoric) the
prejudices, arguments and repressive practices of rightwing re- ligious
nuts -- and they tried to promote such views more broadly within the
left. It seems that most **[queer revolutionaries were attracted to what
the RCP was putting out]{.mark}**. That they'd go take out the RCP's
newspaper, the Revolutionary Worker, get involved, and **[then someone
would]{.mark} meet with them to have serious [talk about "the
Homosexual- ity Question," and then they would
disappear]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In that respect, I was a bit
different. I got involved before I came out. After meeting the
revolutionaries of the RCP, I joined the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade (RCYB), really throwing myself into it. I was con- vinced that a
possible revolutionary situation might be just around the corner
(remember that slogan, "Revo- lution in the '80s -- Go for it!"?). All
my free time was spent building for the work this party was doing in my
area: I was going to dem- onstrations, taking the paper out, talking to
everyone about Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM), postering a couple times a
week, going to meetings. It was my whole life. Falling in love Then I
started feeling attracted to another girl who was hanging around the
RCYB. She was really funny and cute and smart. I thought she was great
and I really respected her, especially the way she stood up for what she
believed at school, how she would face off the cops at a demonstration
without fear, the way she was al- ways ready to take the paper out even
when the rest of us got discouraged by all the rejection. I wanted to be
around her all the time and I thought about her con- stantly. Everyone
else could see I had it bad, but I never noticed! She gave me her green
kaffyah and I wore it all the time, even when I went to bed. I always
wanted to ride in the same car with her when we went some- place. Her
high school was across town from mine but I'd always try to find a
reason to go to her side of town to take the paper out in the afternoons
so that I could be with her. Finally, one of the other guys in the RCYB
said something about me acting like I was in love with her. They were
all teasing me about it. I realized that I had had feelings for girls
for a while and I started to come to terms with the fact that I was a
lesbian. A family's anger\... When I came out, everyone at home was
upset. I was prepared for their reactions, I'd heard other stories from
teenagers who had come out about how they were rejected or kicked out of
the house, so I was ready to face that from my family. My family was
upset and angry. They were disap- pointed in me and wanted me to just
"get over" what- ever young adult phase I was going through that made me
"think" I was gay. I was so depressed that they couldn't accept me,
their daughter, for who I was. But knowing my family's conservative
background, I had expected them to have a negative reaction so it didn't
surprise me. \...then the rejection by comrades [What really shocked me
was how [leaders in the RCYB and the RCP reacted]{.mark} when I told
them I was gay.]{.underline} I have to say that none of the other Youth
Brigade members had a problem with it except one guy. He was a little
immature and made a joke about how he didn't mind if a girl was gay but
there's no way in hell he'd sleep in the same room with a guy who was
gay. (We'd just stayed at a motel when we traveled to another city for
an event and all of us had shared a room). But re- ally most young
communists of my generation never thought that being gay was wrong -- it
was something that had to be imposed on us from without, and was done
without ever really hearing or respecting our insights. But while the
comrades in the Youth Brigade were fine with it [I was really shocked by
how [hostile]{.mark} the RCYB leaders were. I was immediately separated
from the rest of brigade -- they stopped having me there for meetings
and paper discussions, I wasn't invited to take out the paper or go
running in the mornings, and when I showed up at the bookstore for an
event I was told to leave.]{.underline} Being educated I didn't
understand the reaction. Finally, after [several months of being
excluded from everything and with virtually no communication from Youth
Brigade leaders]{.underline}, I received a phone call telling me to show
up for a meeting at a coffee shop across town the next weekend. Several
Youth Brigade leaders were there as well as two RCP leaders (one of whom
had never spoken to me before but was clearly in charge). Everyone was
very serious. I was pretty intimidat- ed and scared. [[They]{.mark} were
there to [explain]{.mark} to me what reality was, and what a communist
view supposedly was: Why [be- ing a lesbian arose from unjustified
hostilities toward men]{.mark} as a whole, how it was like being a
feminist-sepa- ratist, and how in the new society, men wouldn't hurt
women and so women would no longer respond to their oppression by
becoming gay. Their argument was that [lesbianism]{.mark} [was]{.mark} a
form of [reformism]{.mark} -- because it sought relief from oppression
by developing a lifestyle within capitalism. They made a series of
deductive arguments -- very divorced from reality and my own situation
-- that les- bianism was an ideological choice that embodied a re-
formist political program and that was therefore not compatible with
being a communist revolutionary]{.underline}. Let me remind you that all
of this was happening to me when I was a high school student -- just
barely starting to sort out life, love and sexuality. Looking back it
seems clearer [[they had reproduced within revolutionary ranks]{.mark}
(and [using "communist" rhetoric]{.mark}) [prejudices, arguments and
repressive practic- es that were not far removed from rightwing]{.mark}
religious nuts and [homophobes]{.mark}.]{.underline} I was very young
and pretty naïve I guess -- [I took what I was told at face value as the
communist verdict on gay people]{.underline}, and on me. But at a gut
level I couldn't reconcile the idea that my feelings for other girls
meant that I was being bour- geois. I still was attracted to other
girls, even when I berated myself for feeling that way. I was told that
I was viewing the girl in the RCYB that I liked as a sex object, that I
was objectifying her because I had sexual thoughts about her. In one
painful meeting (at a Burger King -- I never wanted to eat there again
after this!) I admitted tear- fully that, yes, I had imagined seeing her
naked while masturbating. I felt really guilty. [**[I was pushed into
the closet as a price for being considered a revolutionary by those I
respected]{.mark}**. And this was doubly painful: I was forced to deny
my own feelings in public self-criticism, and I was being trained to
confront my continuing feelings as reactionary in the privacy of my own
mind.]{.underline} Under watch Once I started being allowed back to
Brigade ac- tivities I apologized to this girl for objectifying her; but
she just laughed and gave me a hug and said not to worry about it. Local
RCP leaders and the Youth Brigade coordi- nator kept me away from her
though, and talked about sending me to live in a Brigade house in
another city for the summer. That idea was dropped after I failed
geometry and had to go to summer school, but for the next year or so, I
was closely watched. However, [I was spouting the party line, so I was
"welcomed" back in the fold. But part of me wondered, what would happen
if I didn't accept what I had been told to believe.]{.underline} A few
years later there was another change in the division of labor, I was
sent to go work in another area with a new group of people. I had left
high school and gotten my GED so I was anxious to start working full
time and not having to depend on my family. When I was told to apply for
a particular kind of job and live in a shared apartment with some other
party folks, I complied. I didn't really have any reason not to, even
though I knew that living with people would be like being at the brigade

As a queer criminological text, this book issues a broader challenge to
the discipline of criminology. [[It is a call to **question the
production of 'official time lines'**]{.mark} and simplistic dichotomies
[for the exclusions that they engender and the complexities that they
gloss over]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[**Rather than tease out the 'good'**
police practices and strategies **from the 'bad'**, a critical and
historical queer optic allows us to appreciate the mutual constitution
and interdependence of these categories, the slippages and continuities
between them in practice, and the powerful forces that reproduce and
circulate them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than view the uneven and
coercive effects of policing as products of the actions of biased,
deficient, or ill-equipped individual officers, [[we should broaden our
analytical framework to account for the historical genesis of policing
as a heteronormative and settler colonial project]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This reminds us of the importance of preventing (and pursuing
accountability for) the immediate harms of policing and
punishment---whether as activists or scholars---without getting swept up
in the administration of these systems and therefore invested in their
continuity. [[Instead, we might consider strategies to demilitarise and
disempower police]{.mark}]{.underline} (McDowell & Fernandez 2018), [[as
well as dedicating more resources towards exploring community-based
responses to harm]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kim 2018). As an emerging field
of study seeking to distinguish itself from 'mainstream' criminology,
queer criminology has much to benefit from engagement with abolitionist
and anti-carceral feminist thinking (Carlton & Russell 2018; Stanley &
Smith 2011; Thuma 2015). [[We must remain attuned to the violence that
underpins the state's promise of protection]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather
than accepting it at face value that the incorporation of previously
excluded groups signifies historical progress and positive change, this
book has sought to illustrate the exclusive and regulatory effects of
the politics of recognition. My hope is that the narrative presented in
this book sparks new questions about the relationship between sexual and
gender politics and police power. The surface support for LGBT rights
amongst police leaders might indicate success on some levels for LGBT
activists who have long fought for queers to be seen as other than
criminal and to have access to state protection when it is needed or
desired. However, [[the adoption of LGBT rights language and symbols in
by police public relations produces ambivalence and hostility towards
police within LGBT movements]{.underline}]{.mark} (Russell 2019).
Evolving LGBT-police relations prompt renewed discussion about the role
and effects of policing in society, for queers and others. Queer
Histories and the Politics of Policing has sought to make sense of
contemporary strategies of governing sexuality and gender---the
histories from which they emerge and the futures they foreclose---and
the threads of resistance running through them.

### 2AC \-- AT: Identity Politics

#### Class-analysis that attempts to eschew identity politics is just a ruse for white middle class men to feel included and lead the marginalized in the glory of the revolution. It is an invisible form of white paternal saviorism that pushes identity through the back door of anti-capitalist movements.

Belonging," New Literary History, Vol. 31, No. 4, pages 840-841\]

Although in his contribution Eric Lott targets Professor Michaels\'s
comments and his own recent feud with Timothy Brennan (who unfortunately
is not included in this volume) rather than Ken\'s argument, what Eric
says about "left and liberal fundamentalists" who "simply and somewhat
penitently" urge us to "'go back to class'" could also be directed at
Ken\'s conclusion. Ken writes, "Crafting a political left that does not
merely reflect existing racial divisions starts with the relatively
mundane proposition that it is possible to make a persuasive appeal to
the given interests of working and unemployed women and men, regardless
of race, in support of a program for economic justice." On this one, I
side with Eric, rather than Tim and Ken. Standing on the left depends on
whose left side we\'re talking about. My left might be your right and
vice versa, because it depends on what direction we\'re facing, and what
direction depends on which identities we\'re assuming and affirming.
Eric adds, \"Even in less dismissive \[than Tim\'s\] accounts of new
social movements based not on class but on identities formed by
histories of injustice, there is a striking a priori sense of
voluntarism about the investment in this cause or that movement or the
other issue---as though determining the most fundamental issue were a
matter of the writer\'s strength of feeling rather than a studied or
analytical sense of the ever-unstable balance of forces in a hegemonic
bloc at a given moment.\" I agree, but I\'ll risk mangling what Eric
says by putting it more crassly. [**[Touting class or \"economic
justice\" as the fundamental stance for left identity is just another
way of telling everybody else to shut up so I can be heard above the
fray.]{.mark} Because of the force of \"identity politics,\" a leftist
white person would be leery of claiming to lead Blacks toward the
promised land,**]{.underline} a leftist straight man leery [**of
claiming to lead women or queers, but**,]{.underline} for a number of
complex rationalizations[, **we in the middle class**]{.underline}

fundamentalism,\" I\'d call]{.underline},** at the risk of sounding
harsh**, [left paternalism]{.underline}**[. **Of the big identity groups
articulated through \"identity politics,\" [economic class remains the
only identity where a straight white middle-class man can still feel
comfortable claiming himself a leading political voice, and thus he may
sometimes overcompensate by screaming that this is the only identity

is beyond identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** Partly **[this is because

transferable to those outside the group who commit]{.mark} themselves to
it [wholeheartedly enough]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If we look back, we
realize even this magical quality is not special to a history of class
struggle, as whites during the New Negro movements of the early
twentieth century felt that they were vanguard race leaders because they
had putatively imbibed some essential qualities of Negroness by
cross-identifying with the folk and their culture.

#### Their theorization of Black death is inapplicable to Black queer subjects \-- Black queer subjectivity exists in a space of injury, marked by perpetual conditions of vulnerability and openness to violence rather than bound by non-existence -- only including an analytic of queerness can account for the ways the afterlife of slavery uniquely demarcates Black queer life.

of Injury and Paths of Desire," Urbana: University of Illinois Press,

Black Queer Freedom: Spaces of Injury and Paths of Desire begins with a
consideration of Big Freedia's account of her life because her
experiences can help us think through the boundaries of queer freedom
and, specifically, the social threats that are directed toward the Black
queer body. [Simply moving through space---that is, walking down the
street, going to work, traveling across state or national borders, or
interacting with institutions---proves to be especially risky business
for racial and sexual minoritie]{.underline}s. This book explains how
[attending to and challenging such threats constitutes the defining
element in the work of Black queer cultural producers]{.underline}.
Black Queer Freedom presents the argument that [queerness, meaning
same-sex desire and gender nonconformity, does introduce the threat of
injury, but artists throughout the Black diaspora use queer desire to
negotiate spaces of injury]{.underline}.3 I show how [Black queer bodies
are perceived as social threats, and this perception, in turn, results
in threats (physical, psychological, socioeconomic) against these
bodies. The Black queer body is immersed in a veritable threat feedback
loop. With]{.underline} the spatial metaphor of the feedback loop, I
describe the circular thinking that makes minority groups be perceived
as perpetual threats. This loop characterizes a situation in which a
majority group feels threatened by the presence of a minority group, and
this feeling [encourages material and symbolic violence against the
perceived threat of the minority group, which ironically strengthens
(through discriminatory logic) the social perception of the minority
population as menacing and troublemaking]{.underline}. This threat
loop--- that minority bodies are assumed to be threatening whether or
not they pose an actual threat---[constitutes the space of injury and
creates the conditions for Black queer vulnerability.]{.underline} This
space of injury for the Black queer body is not necessarily about a
particular architecture or location; it is more about the perception and
engagement of that body. The space of injury is potentially any space
that a queer body occupies or moves through. The point here is not to
avoid precision in specifying the space of injury but, instead, to make
clear how for many artists and thinkers, it is vital to recognize the
[possibility of injury in all locations and resist the desired belief
that certain places may be assumed to be safe]{.underline} (such as,
home, family, or places that claim to be queer friendly[). The space of
injury actually describes the Black queer body as it exists and moves
through space]{.underline}. I do not seek to cast this body as having
injury inhere to it; rather, I make the point that because of social
norms and dominant ideologies, this body may always be on the verge of
injury. Given this idea, I contend that [Black queer individuals are
injury-bound subjects.]{.underline} I develop this idea through Abdul
JanMohamed's conception of [the death-bound-subject and theories of
Black social death]{.underline}.4 JanMohamed defines this subject as one
that is formed "by the imminent and ubiquitous threat of death" (2). It
is a subject bound to and constantly directed toward death. His
discussion is useful because it provides a framework for recognizing the
social construction of vulnerability for the Black (male) subject in a
hostile racial climate. I [shift focus from death to injury because the
threat of death does not fully capture the multiple kinds of threat
(microaggressions, intimidation, humiliation, displacements, detention,
defamation, medical abuses, and misgenderings) that racial and sexual
minorities experience.]{.underline} One could argue that every physical
threat implies the threat of death, but I think the [overemphasis on
death obscures the nuance and complexity of the multiple kinds of
vulnerability minorities face]{.underline}. Freedia's concern about
getting a beatdown is first a fear of injury---physical, emotional, and
social. An [emphasis on different manifestations of injury illuminates
how a broader array of interactions can create conditions of
vulnerability, and this more capacious sense of social threat provides
the opportunity to consider how gender and class dynamics inflect the
threats posed by racism and homophobia]{.underline}.5 This book reflects
my careful analysis about how [threats of queer injury work assiduously
along lines of sex and gender expressions.]{.underline} Throughout this
book, the reader will find an explicit focus on the experiences of queer
women and queer men with nonconventional gender expression. I work from
the understanding that [gender expression and identity are imbricated
with same-sex desire and can deeply impact if and how one experiences
social threat.]{.underline} This recurring attention to [the role of
gender in the experience of injury indicates the intersectional approach
of the methodology as well as a recognition on the level of the argument
that all queer bodies may face injury, but all of those bodies do not
experience injury in the same manner or to the same extent]{.underline}.
Injury, like queerness, is not one-dimensional.6 In a move toward
thinking about injury and with a focus on queer bodies that might be
injured but not killed, this volume [builds on]{.underline} Darius
Bost's bold [intervention into Afro-pessimism and the emergent
discourses on Black social death]{.underline}.7 Bost insists, ["In the
context of slavery's afterlife, asserting the presence of black gay
bodies signals how contemporary theories of antiblackness replicate the
historical processes of secondary marginalization experienced by
blackness's others]{.underline}" (15; emphasis added). What this critic
points to is that [which gets lost in the overemphasis on death and
absence, especially when we talk about queer bodies, which are often
already marginalized if not absent from the narratives and records of
the past.]{.underline} My [framework of injury emphasizes embodied
presence rather than physical or epistemic absence.]{.underline} I take
seriously material and epistemic violence but am mindful [not to lose
sight of the specific realities of queer embodiment within those
paradigms.]{.underline}

#### [Including queer desire and sexual life in their analytic paradigm generates zones of possibility for insurgent Black life within the conditions of social death -- non-normative desire contests the perpetual "threat status" of Black queer being and moves towards an autonomous articulation of life.]{.underline}

of Injury and Paths of Desire," Urbana: University of Illinois Press,
accessed 7-23-2022) \-- nikki

In bringing injury to the fore, this book also [prioritizes desire as a
means for contesting or simply dealing with social threat.]{.underline}
In the context of a pervasive environment of death, the question of
desire becomes secondary in JanMohamed's analysis. He explains, The
imminent, unpredictable possibility of death makes \[this subject\] live
in such a way that his being is consumed with the preoccupation of
avoiding the possibility of death. On the other hand, the same structure
requires him to control his desire to live as fully as he would like
since stepping out of the bounds of his social-death could easily result
in his death. He is thus obliged to control and repress his own desire
for a full life. The deathbound-subject's "life" is thus defined by the
need to avoid the possibilities of life as well as the possibility of
death. (19; original emphasis) JanMohamed does a skillful job in tracing
out the systematic constraints that render the death-bound-subject a
liminal figure who often must restrain or control desire with the goal
of self-protection. However, the move to limit or restrain desire is not
a prominent concern for Black queer artists and thinkers. Even as they
trace out the exact kinds of restraints that JanMohamed describes, the
artists considered in this book [consistently and defiantly express
desire and claim a freedom within restriction. I track an embracing of
life and a declaration of desire, both of which are done within the
context of injury. The recognition of the ubiquitous nature of many
kinds of threats makes the insistence on life and desire more important
and their articulations more compelling.]{.underline} The injury-bound
subject is a subject who desires, a subject defined not solely by injury
but by desire (i.e., affection, unrestrained pleasure, freedom of
movement, self-definition, and unencumbered embodiment), and it is the
threat of injury that often informs the investment in disruptive desire.
These desires become the subject of artwork by Black diasporic artists,
and I evaluate the means for expressing such desire and explain the
artists' detailing of the social and psychological contexts of threat.
Throughout, this book demonstrates how desire is understood to be a
space of freedom as well as a strategy that redefines space. [This
desirous freedom is not a panacea that solves all problems, nor is it
necessarily long-lasting; nevertheless, it offers moments of
satisfaction, control, and autonomy.]{.underline} Sometimes, a simple
kiss can make one feel freed for a moment. My emphasis on desire in the
context of injury builds on recent work from Black queer theorists
around questions of the erotic and pleasure. In his exploration of the
social significance of unprotected, or "raw," sex to Black gay men,
Marlon M. Bailey advances the concept of erotic (sexual) autonomy in
exploring how gay men choose sexual practices in the context of
structural drivers. He insists that there is a [need to develop a method
that "accounts for sexual desires and practices---the contradictions
between them---and the social factors and conditions" that shape the
paths of and contour those desires and practices.]{.underline}8 As much
as his essay is about the value of taking pleasure seriously in studies
of Black gay male sexual practices and HIV/AIDS, it also reinforces the
point that [desire is always expressed in a sociocultural setting, a
setting that may be anti-Black and determined by social and economic
disparities.]{.underline} For Bailey, raw sex becomes one means for a
resistant expression of individual desire and a technique of critiquing
prominent discourses about queer vulnerability. In a different context
but a similar conceptual register, Amber Jamilla Musser argues, in her
extended consideration of sexual objectification of minoritarian women's
bodies, for the importance of stressing embodied pleasure.9 Musser's
book centers around what she calls "brown jouissance," a concept that
emphasizes sensual embodiment ("fleshiness") that brings together
pleasure and pain, subjectivity and objectivity (3). She refuses an
understanding of pleasure that might be understood as moving beyond the
body ("jouissance" in the psychoanalytic sense). Musser rejects a binary
understanding of racialized female embodiment as either being
perpetually objectified or simply liberated in a way that might ignore
the kinds of structural realities that Bailey describes. In my reading,
brown jouissance is a framework for analysis more than a simple
description of a kind of pleasure. Brown jouissance is not just about
asserting a pleasure-centered subjectivity. The analytic highlights the
social conditions that work around and often against the subject; it
reflects a "move toward the space around the individual" as it
accentuates expression of the sensual for the individual (42). For both
Bailey and Musser, [defiant assertions of erotic pleasure push against
axes of discrimination. What I take from this body of work is that
pleasure may be a tool for undermining acts of interpellation but only
when queer pleasure is made visible within its restrictive contexts can
we fully discern and evaluate the queer subject]{.underline}. Pleasure
must be a primary analytic, but pleasure considered in a vacuum tells us
very little. It is for this reason that I emphasize threat and forces
that seek to limit expressions of queerness in my consideration of
desire. The critical move to attend to the "space around" is a way to
shed light on the dynamics and complexities of the threat feedback loop.
In drawing attention to the "space around," I consistently detail how
this space---consisting of social elements, including laws, public
opinion, built environments, family, and employers---determines the
social legibility of queer bodies and influences individuals'
relationships to their bodies. The space around bodies informs our
understanding of the bodies themselves. I am interested in bodies in
space.

Intersections and Dissents: Black Studies and Queer Theory

Before discussing the particularities of Afro-Pessimism and Queer
Negativity, definitions

of queerness and blackness, along with their general fields, are needed
to place the overall

relationship between the two. Of course, queer theory arose as
predominantly white in its subject

matter and considerations. Writers and theorists, such as Roderick A.
Ferguson, Barbara

Christian, Evelynn Hammonds, E. Patrick Johnson, José Esteban Muñoz,
Jasbir K. Puar, Kathryn

Bond Stockton, and Jack Halberstam, have attended to the field's
treatment of race "as an

addendum." However, more work needs to be done in this regard, for the
whiteness of queer studies still persists. We see this most explicitly
in the ways in which queer theory and queer of

color or black queer theory appear as separate entities in disciplinary
categories and even indexes

of books. Even if one considers queer of color theory as a subfield of
queer studies, the blackness

in the theory must be stated; otherwise, queer theory assumes whiteness.

A similar dynamic applies to black studies, for unless queer is stated
in the title of black

studies or in one of its projects, heterosexuality prevails as the
assumption. Homophobia in the

black community is certainty a partner in this, which has been
thoroughly critiqued by Audre

Lorde, Barbara Smith, and other black feminist theorists. Similarly,
systematic racism speaks to

queer theory's white default. This is not to say that the black
community is more homophobic

than others or that racism and homophobia are comparable injustices. The
point is that social and

political discriminations penetrate these theoretical modes. The fields'
focuses certainly

contribute to this issue, as queer theory attends to sexuality and black
studies to race. The issue is

not the areas' concentrations but is the assumptions which underlie
their projects and manifest in

their scholarship. In other words, queer theory and black studies have
enacted the norm of the

other: queer as white and black as heterosexual.

These theories and communities at large still enact these norms,
perhaps, on more subtle

levels or, perhaps, not so subtle registers. We witness this in one
recent controversy concerning

the rainbow flag. In the summer of 2017, the city of Philadelphia
redesigned Gilbert Baker's

original rainbow layout by adding two stripes to its rainbow---one black
and one brown placed

above the rainbow. Philadelphia's flag was a part of the city's More
Color More Pride campaign,

aiming to illustrate gay liberation's need for and enactment of
inclusivity. Despite the flag's

intentions, its new design drew harsh criticism within the white gay
community, as the critique

The [notion of [a]{.mark} generic [life cycle organized around]{.mark}
conjugal [union and reproduction functions as]{.mark} perhaps the most
prominent way of [envisioning]{.mark} the everyday meaning of
[continuity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such an account positions [marital
couplehood as necessary for procreation itself, and thus the
[survival]{.mark} of the human species appears to [depend on bourgeois
family]{.mark} [formation and]{.mark} [homemaking]{.mark}]{.underline}.
J. Jack [[Halberstam]{.mark} [refers to]{.mark} these "conventions of
family, inheritance, and child rearing" as "[reproductive
temporality]{.mark}," suggesting that "queer uses of time and space
develop, at least in part, in opposition to the institutions of family,
heterosexuality, and reproduction."123 From this perspective, [queer
experiences of time run athwart]{.mark} of [a projected life
cours]{.mark}e organized around heterocourtship, conventional marriage,
[and the generationality of the nuclear
famil]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}.124 More than imposing a particular
vision of proper desire and kinship dynamics, this conception of a
regular life [weds personal development to a universalizing account of
the movement of tim]{.underline}e. That process can be described as
[[chrononormativity]{.underline}]{.mark}, which Elizabeth Freeman
defines as "a technique by which [institutional forces come to seem like
somatic facts" and in which "historically specific regimes of
asymmetrical power" appear as "seemingly ordinary bodily tempos and
routines]{.underline}." Furthermore, ["these [teleologies of
living,]{.mark} in turn, [structure the logic of a 'people's'
inheritance:]{.mark} rather than just the transfer of private property
along heteroreproductive lines, [inheritance becomes the
familial]{.mark} and collective [legacy]{.mark} from which a group will
draw a properly political future."]{.underline}125 The [heteronormative
presumption]{.underline} that the nuclear family and its privatized
domestic arrangements serve as the basis for human futurity [per se
[casts]{.mark} the legal, political, economic, and [spatial dynamics
necessary to sustain]{.mark} that [social formation as]{.mark} simply
[the]{.mark} immanent [basis for the unfolding of time itself,]{.mark}
as inevitably providing the framework for thinking the past, the future,
and their relation to the present]{.underline}. Here Freeman builds on
Dana Luciano's notion of [[chronobiopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark},
developed in Arranging Grief, which Luciano defines as ["the sexual
arrangement of the time of life.]{.underline}"126 In addition to being
institutionalized in various ways, [this specific [developmental path
comes to serve phenomenologically as part of the perceptual
tradition]{.mark} [through which]{.mark} people reckon with the
possible, and [heteronuclearity provides the background against]{.mark}
which other modes of making a life appear as [queer deviation]{.mark}s
or perverse orientations.]{.underline}127 [By seeking to challenge the
legitimation and proliferation of straight time]{.underline} (which
itself can be understood as a denial of, in Bergson's terms, the
"qualitative multiplicity" of temporal experience)[, queer critique
helps draw attention to how ordinary experiences are influenced by the
momentum of dominant formulations of time as well as how such
experiences might run in another direction, opening onto forms of
temporal feeling that do not fit officially endorsed inheritances and
trajectories]{.underline}.128 In other words, [[queer analyses]{.mark}
help open ways of registering the imposed straightness of time while
also highlighting alternative kinds of temporal experience.]{.underline}
These kinds of questions about how one conceptualizes the proper shape
of a life [certainly [resonate with the ongoing subjection of Native
peoples to]{.mark} projects of [assimilation]{.mark} that seek to
inculcate ostensibly civilized ways of being in-tim]{.underline}e. In
fact, the [[imposition of heteronormative]{.mark} social dynamics has
been a key part of the U.S. government's efforts to supplant Native
modes of collectivity, casting]{.underline} extant [Indigenous forms of
association]{.underline}, occupancy, household [formation, and
governance as merely vestiges of a bygone tim]{.underline}e.129 Many of
the [initiatives within Indian policy]{.underline} have worked to
reorient everyday forms of Native feeling and practice, [seeking to
alter the experience of time so that U.S. legal geographies]{.underline}
and claims to sovereignty [provide the background.]{.underline}
[[That]{.mark} chronobiopolitical [project depends on an encompassing
chronogeopolitics]{.mark},]{.underline} implicitly [[positing]{.mark}
the givenness of U.S. [territoriality]{.mark} and jurisdiction [as
the]{.mark} self-evident [basis for understanding the movement of
time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In particular, the [allotment
program employs reproductive temporality]{.underline} in ways that
justify the jurisdiction of the settler state (chapter 3), and a similar
aim can be seen at play in the reduction of Native peoplehood to
quantities of procreatively transmitted Indian "blood" (chapter  4).
[[Queer theorizations of temporality]{.mark},]{.underline} then, [[aid
in understanding Native opposition to such policy
framings]{.underline}.]{.mark} From this perspective, such [resistance
appears not as a refusal of the modern but as an expression of
alternative experiences of time]{.underline} that persist alongside
settler imperatives, and are affected by them, while not being reducible
to them. This kind of [queer scholarship further challenges]{.underline}
the implicit developmentalism of notions of [a universal
now,]{.underline} placing under significant pressure the historicist
presumption that the past is an alien space separated by an unbridgeable
gulf from the present. Carolyn Dinshaw has suggested the need to move
beyond a notion of history as straight, as an unfolding "causal
sequence" that, as such, rules out "an expanded range of temporal
experiences---experiences not regulated by 'clock' time or by a
conceptualization of the present as singular and fleeting; experiences
not narrowed by the idea that time moves steadily forward, that it is
scarce, that we live on only one temporal plane."130 The possible range
of ways of being-in-time is radically limited if one envisions
temporality as singular and linear, as replacing what has come before in
its steady forward movement (the kind of synchronous slices of time that
Bergson displaces through the notion of duration). Moreover, this notion
of time as an unending succession---in which the present unfolds out of
the past while supplanting it---can be understood as itself relatively
new. As Valerie Rohy observes, "historical alterity is, after all, a
recent invention; the conviction that past ages are noncontiguous with
modernity is a hallmark of modernity," and in "Queering History"
Jonathan Goldberg and Madhavi Menon ask, "Why has it come to pass that
we apprehend the past in the mode of difference? [How has 'history' come
to equal 'alterity'?]{.underline}"131 The [positing of the past as on
the other side of a great gulf contributes to the sense of the present
as something of an integrated whole against which to juxtapose
historical events]{.underline} or dynamics (our understandings now
versus theirs then), and doing so replaces the coexistence of divergent
experiences of time with the difference between the contemporary moment
and that which it supposedly has surpassed (such as the antinomy of the
modern versus the traditional). The [idea of a singular, linear
unfolding in which the present supersedes the past might be thought of
as a form of "compulsory heterotemporality]{.underline}" in which the
understanding of time "mimes the heteronormative demand for proper
sexual sequencing," [[replaying conceptions of proper individual life
sequence at the level of time itself.]{.underline}]{.mark}132 Such a
vision of history [[can be seen at play in]{.mark} the imagining of
certain [national events]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} like the Civil
War[, [as moments of transition]{.mark} in which the country breaks away
from a degraded past (]{.underline}slavery in the case of the Civil
War), [[as opposed to tracing the regularities of settler
violence]{.mark} in which the past appears less as a space of alterity
than in a relation of continuity with the presen]{.underline}t
(discussed in chapter 2). In this sense, processes of [settler temporal
recognition and inclusion might be understood as themselves largely
enacted through forms of compulsory heterotemporality]{.underline} that
depend on treating the straightness of time (and the ongoing
transcendence of the past) as given. If historicism gains legitimacy
through its implicit alignment with straightness, [deviations from that
experience of time can appear as queer]{.underline}. Temporal
orientations that do not fit dominant Euramerican frames of reference
can be interpellated as abnormal fixations on the past, [translated as
aberrant tendencies toward anachronism]{.underline} (as opposed to being
seen as alternative ways of being-intime). Within Euramerican
discourses, [the Indian becomes the paradigmatic figure for these kinds
of nostalgic inclinations.]{.underline} Discussing the emergence of
protocols of bourgeois grieving in the nineteenth-century United States,
Luciano observes, "[[The life-world of the Indian,]{.mark} exterior to
the new nation's modes of ordering, [could only be incorporated
into]{.mark} [its historical timeline through its construction as
permanently anterio]{.mark}r]{.underline}," later adding, "The
[progressive substitution of Indian melancholia, t[he ultimately fatal
embrace of the past, by white melancholy, the reflective look backward
that enabled one to continue moving forward]{.mark}, thus bespoke, to
whites, their own more sophisticated comprehension of the 'true' nature
of time's passage."]{.underline}133 The Indian serves as a symbol of
backward relations to time, of [insurmountable melancholic investments
in the past]{.underline} in contrast to the putative straightness of
time's passage[. The supposed anteriority of Native lifeworlds provides
a model of perverse fixity, and, thus, [Indigenous experiences of time
seem as]{.mark} if they are [a deviant way of remaining caught in the
past.]{.mark}]{.underline} From this perspective Indigenous duration can
be only the carrying forward of what properly should be past, an
inversion of "real" time or "natural" time which implicitly is that of
Euramerican historicism. Conversely[, taking queer insights into account
can enrich the meaning of historical density when approaching forms of
everyday Native perception, storying, and processes of
becoming.]{.underline} Rather than being seen as either a function of
straight time (heterotemporal transmission) or simply a deviation from
dominant settler linearity, s[torying can be treated as oriented by its
own trajectories]{.underline}, giving rise to fields of possibility
[that cannot be measured within or through settler frames of
reference.]{.underline} Conceptualizing time as not only plural but
sensuous, as an expression of affective orientations, directs attention
toward the need to consider how quotidian forms and feelings of
continuity emerge as part of, in Cordova's terms, the work of
"maintaining stability" amid ongoing processes of transformation and
change.134 S[hared material conditions can engender forms of perception
in common, providing a frame of reference through which individuals
reckon with their joint environment.]{.underline} However, [such an
understanding of perceptual tradition can rely too much on the
regularity of those shared circumstances and the group's long-term
containment within a fairly circumscribed area]{.underline}. If they
were ever applicable to Native peoples, [those kinds of consistency do
not necessarily characterize a good deal of Indigenous
experience]{.underline} in the United States since the mid-nineteenth
century, given dispossessions, dislocations, privatizations, programs of
detribalization, urbanization, and various other mobilities (chosen and
coerced). [Story offers a means of understanding how collective
histories can be immanent within everyday interaction and perception,
generating kinds of continuity and connections across time that do not
necessarily require immediate contiguity of experience]{.underline}
(either geographic or generational). As Miranda suggests, having "an
identity and community" is possible even in the absence of a legally
recognized land base and amid other forms of fragmentation, and part of
what enables the sustaining of peoplehood in conditions of dispersion or
diaspora is the felt presence of shared (hi)stories amid the
circumstances of ordinary life, stories that intimately animate and
orient ongoing collective practices of becoming (of re-creation,
reinvention, and resurgence).135

#### Heteronormativity in today's society can be directly traced back to settler colonialism

[Modern sexuality arises in settler societies as a function of the
biopolitics of settler colonialism]{.underline}. In the United States,
[[the sexual colonization of Native peoples produced]{.mark} modern
sexuality as [\"settler sexuality\": a white and national
heteronormativity formed by regulating native sexuality and
gende]{.mark}r while appearing to supplant them with the sexual
modernity of settlers.]{.underline} [[Queer modernities in a settler
society are produced in]{.mark} contextual [relation]{.mark}ship t[o the
settler colonial conditions of modern sexuality. White settlers]{.mark}
promulgating colonial heteropatriarchy [queered native peoples
and]{.mark} all [racialized]{.mark} subject [populations for elimination
and regulation]{.mark} by the biopolitics of settler
colonialism]{.underline}. Achille Mbembe has adapted Giorgio Agamben\'s
account of biopower to colonial situations by explaining colonial rule
as \"necropolitics,\" or a positioning of the space-time of the colony
in a state of exception to Western imperial rule.1 Mbembe invites
revisiting the racialization and sexualization of colonial situations,
including in white settler societies in the Americas that formed
multiracial societies from the transatlantic slave trade, colonized
indentured labor, and genocidal control of Indigenous peoples under
European settlement. However, to pursue such an account, scholars must
explain how the colony comes to be located in a state of exception in
context of white-supremacist settler colonialism and the logic of
Indigenous elimination. Mbembe\'s account limited its analysis to modern
regimes of colonial biopolitics that arose in the nineteenth-century
European franchise colonization of Africa and Asia. As a practice that
is not past but continues today, the biopolitics of settler colonialism
requires specific study.2 This chapter names necessary elements to such
an account, narrowed to explain the settler colonial necropolitics that
queered native peoples in the Americas by targeting modes of embodiment,
desire, and kinship that Native queer and Two-Spirit people reclaim as
their and their peoples\' histories. I argue that [[the biopolitics of
settler colonialism produces]{.mark} settler sexuality as [the context
traversed by]{.mark} non-Native and Native people formulating [queer
modernities]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The queering of native peoples
defined]{.underline}]{.mark} [not only settler sexuality, broadly, but
also the definition of [queer subjects]{.mark} among white settlers: [as
a primitive, racialized sexual margin]{.mark} akin to what white
settlers attempted to conquer among natives]{.underline}. when queer
white settlers reversed such discourses---notably by laying claim to the
colonial object berdache3---they argued their inclusion in settler
society by traversing normative paths to settler citizenship, which
incorporate and transcend ties to native roots to achieve national
belonging. non-native [queer modernities form by gathering a
multiracial, transnational constituency as a diversity that exists in a
non-native relationship to disappearing indigeneity]{.underline}. Yet,
[[narrating native disappearance distinguishes]{.mark} non-native queer
modernities from [the survival of native queer people, who negotiate
settler sexuality by recalling knowledges and practices queered by
colonial hetero-patriarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}. native people defined
unique identities, including two-Spirit, as modern, decolonizing native
critiques of settler colonialism and its structuring of non-native queer
projects. this chapter grounds my interpretation of non-native and
native queer modernities within a genealogy of white-supremacist settler
colonialism as the condition of sexual modernity and its contestation in
a settler society.

#### Settler colonialism is inextricably linked to the creation of heteropatriarchal norms in the US

**Morgensen 11** (Scott Lauria, assistant professor of gender studies at
Queen's University, "Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and
Indigenous Decolonization", University of Minnesota Press, 11/17/11, pp.
31-53)//JSL

In this light[, [native queer]{.underline}]{.mark} [and Two-Spirit
[activisms can be seen to engage]{.mark}, and contest, [the settler
colonial terms of modern sexuality]{.mark} in ways that remain distinct
from the normative affirmation of those terms in non-native queer
modernities]{.underline}. This occurs in their discrepant engagement
with [[the biopolitics of settler colonialism]{.mark} that [defines
modern sexuality]{.mark} in the United States [as a \"contact
zone]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Following Mary Louise Pratt, this term
invokes Europeans and Indigenous peoples in colonial situations
producing conflictual yet creative exchanges, in which \"conditions of
coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict\" generate \"the
interactive, improvisational dimensions of colonial encounters.\"44
Theorizing modern sexuality as a contact zone has several implications.
First, [recognizing that settler colonialism has not ended, \"contact\"
is recognizable not only in the past or in local spaces but as
[pervasive throughout settler society]{.mark} and all that transpires
within it. Indeed, modern sexuality is the contact zone, with all its
manifestations meaningfully [contextualized by a relationality of
\"natives\" to \"settlers\" on colonized land]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just
[as all modern [sexual subjects and practices]{.mark} in the United
States [arose amid settler colonization and narratives of native
disappearance, native people articulated modern sexuality as a colonial
project while countering it with distinctive Indigenous knowledges and
modes of resistance.]{.mark}]{.underline} Second, [modern sexuality acts
as a contact zone independently of encounters among non-native and
native people]{.underline}. For non-natives, sexual modernity produces
them as subjects of contact because this modernity presumes native
disappearance, by citing native sexual pasts to inspire in non-natives a
sexual future. [For native people]{.underline}, in turn, [sexual
modernity incites contact by presenting itself as the modernity of
settlers.]{.underline} Even native people who embrace it do not erase
its historical ties to colonization, while those who critique it disturb
its conflation of coloniality with modernity and create alternative
spaces for defining native modernities, including native queer and
Two-Spirit activisms. Thus, and third, while the image of a contact zone
suggests that colonization is its context[, [settler
formations]{.underline}]{.mark} [in fact [are]{.mark} being [displaced
by decolonizing native claims on
modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While they are interdependent
with non-native queer cultures and politics[, [native queer
modernities]{.underline}]{.mark} do not derive from them. Rather, they
[creatively articulate modern sexuality as settler sexuality by
[reimagining Indigenous]{.mark} knowledges of [personhood]{.mark} and
community [that]{.mark} never ceased to [trouble the supposed
universality of settler claims]{.mark}]{.underline}. This book traces
the cultural and political effects of this discrepancy in native queer
claims on modernity as a counterpoint to the ubiquitous, but not
all-powerful, effects of settler sexual culture.

#### The biopolitical imposition of settler sexuality forms the backdown of modern-day heteropatriarchy

**Morgensen 11** (Scott Lauria, assistant professor of gender studies at
Queen's University, "Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and
Indigenous Decolonization", University of Minnesota Press, 11/17/11, pp.
31-53)//JSL

In the Americas and, specifically, the United States[, **[the
biopolitics of settler colonialism was constituted by the imposition of
colonial heteropatriarchy and the hegemony of settler
sexuality]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which sought both the elimination of
Indigenous sexuality and its incorporation into settler sexual
modernity. [theorists of sexuality who address biopower and colonization
are indebted to]{.underline} Ann Stoler\'s efforts to locate Foucauldian
[accounts of modern sexuality within colonial studies]{.underline}.8
Although Foucault omitted colonialism from his work on sexuality, Stoler
demonstrated how the histories he traced in Europe explain those of
imperial metropoles and colonial societies producing modern sexuality
and \"race\" as biopower.9 Stoler displaced more common readings of
Foucault\'s history of sexuality in queer theory, which tended to frame
European societies and their normative whiteness as roots of modern
sexuality, and to pay secondary or no attention to race or colonialism.
In particular, early queer accounts of Foucault\'s history of modern
sexuality did not emphasize his reading of it as a mode of bio-politics,
by which he described modern regimes that produce subjects of life by
deploying state racism to define populations for regulation. Stoler
argued that linking theories of biopolitics and colonialism shifts
trajectories of queer theory that would interpret Foucault\'s history of
sexuality as \"a history of western desire.\"10 In light of colonial
histories, Europe is Western only to the extent that it is
metropolitan---a center of colonial empires ---which means that [neither
Europe nor western cultural legacies will be understood without first
studying their formation in relationship to both settler and franchise
colonial societies]{.underline}. Stoler and other scholars in colonial
studies examined how racial and national formations of sexuality
produced the biopolitics of colonial regimes.11 As Stoler notes, [a
focus on modes of reproduction has accounted poorly for
nonheteronormative sexualities and genders, and still requires
critically queer readings]{.underline}. Yet work in colonial strudies
shows ---in concert with Foucault\'s work, but against limits he put on
it---that [[modern sexuality may have arisen first in]{.mark} colonial
societies, including [settler colonial societies]{.mark}]{.underline},
if not in their relationship to European imperial states. On this basis,
[Stoler explains [the sexual and racial regimes of]{.mark} metropolitan
and [colonial societies]{.mark} as [based on a colonial \"education of
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Stoler here marks how [[colonial power
deployed a sovereign power]{.mark} over death [that]{.mark} nevertheless
[became complementary with a modern and disciplinary education of desire
that produced normative subjects]{.mark} of life in relation to subject
populations]{.underline}. She presents colonial biopolitics as what
Foucault called a \"society of normalization\" ---\"a society where the
norm of discipline and the norm of regularization intersect\" --- and
shows that it formed subjects of life and populations marked for deadly
regulation by educating them in their interdependent locations within
colonial regimes.12

#### Settler colonialism is at the core of the heteropatriarchy, and critiques of such heteronormativity that fail to first comprehend that role recreate settler colonialism -- only a prior breakdown of the politics of the settler can resolve either impact

**Morgensen 11** (Scott Lauria, assistant professor of gender studies at
Queen's University, "Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and
Indigenous Decolonization", University of Minnesota Press, 11/17/11, pp.
1-28)//JSL

This book examines how **[[settler colonial power relations among native
and non-native people define the status
\"queer]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" It argues that [modern queer subjects,
cultures, and politics have developed among natives and non-natives in
linked, yet distinct, ways]{.underline}. [The imposition of [colonial
heteropatriarchy relegates native people and all non-native people of
color to queered statuses]{.mark} as racialized populations amid
colonial efforts to eliminate native nationality and settle native
lands]{.underline}. [[Modern sexuality comes into existence when the
heteropatriarchal advancement of white settlers appears to vanquish
sexual primitivity]{.underline}]{.mark}, which white settlers
nevertheless adopt as their own history. [When modern sexuality queers
white settlers, [their effort to reclaim a place within settler society
produces white]{.mark} and non-native [queer politics for recognition by
the state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet [memories and practices of
discrepant sexual cultures among Indigenous peoples and peoples of color
persistently trouble the white settler logics of sexual
modernity]{.underline}. For instance, native modes of kinship,
embodiment, and desire such as those today called \"Two-Spirit\" produce
Native queer modernities that denaturalize settler colonialism. **[the
comparative studies in this book show [settler colonialism as the
context in which non-native and native people produce modern queer
subjects, cultures, and politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
methodological shift in native studies heralded by such scholars as
Linda Tuhiwai Smith and Robert warrior theorizes settler colonialism by
tracing the \"intellectual histories\" (Warrior) and methods of Native
peoples practicing survival, resistance, and decolonization.2
Scholarship in settler colonial studies must support this turn, as when
Patrick Wolfe theorizes settler colonialism as \"a structure, not an
event\" that calls for a sustained denaturalizing critique.3 Andrea
Smith calls on Native studies to refuse its \"ethnographic entrapment\"
in the description of Native cultures and instead become an
interdisciplinary site for explaining and transforming a world defined
by settler colonialism.4 She promotes this shift by invoking queer
theory, which displaced the description of sexual minorities in
gay/lesbian studies by theorizing heteronormativity as a power relation
that conditions all subjects and social life.5 [Scholars at the
intersections of Native and queer studies have responded to these calls
by demonstrating that each field is intrinsic to the
other]{.underline}.6 Smith explains that \"[[the heteronormativity of
settler colonialism\" has subjected Native and non-Native people to
settler colonial rule]{.mark} and regimes of modern
sexuality]{.underline}. In this context, \"[queer\" statuses accrue to
nonheteronormative identities---such as gay, lesbian, bisexual,
transgender, or queer---**[after colonial heteropatriarchy first
redefines embodiment, desire, and kinship to eliminate Native culture,
control racialized populations, and secure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
Sherene Razack\'s term, **[[a \"white settler
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" In this book, queer will refer to
statuses produced by the heteropatriarchal power of white supremacist
settler colonialism. My analysis joins critics of homo-normativity in
arguing that all \"queer\" statuses are not equivalent.7 Jasbir Puar
critiques \"homonationalism\" as the process whereby whiteness and
imperialism create U.S. queer subjects as \"regulatory\" over peoples
queered by U.S. rule.8 I resituate Puar\'s account to argue that **[in a
white settler society[, queer politics produces a settler
homonationalism that will persist unless settler colonialism is
challenged directly]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a condition of queer
modernities]{.underline}.9 [Native and queer studies must regard settler
colonialism as a key condition of modern sexuality on stolen land, and
use this analysis to explain the power of settler colonialism among
Native and non-Native people]{.underline}. This book investigates how
settler colonialism produces what I call \"non-Native queer
modernities,\" in which [modern queers appear definitively not
Native---separated from, yet in perpetual (negative) relationship to,
the original peoples of the lands where they live]{.underline}. The
phrase suggests [a settler colonial logic that disappears indigeneity so
it can be recalled by modern non-natives as a relationship to native
culture and land that might reconcile them to inheriting
conquest]{.underline}.10 Thus, \"non-native\" signifies not a racial or
ethnic identity but a location within settler colonialism. [non-native
queer modernities naturalize settler colonialism when they confront
queer differences as racial or diasporic in a manner that sustains
native disappearance]{.underline}. If queer subjects align with
whiteness or homonationalism, their settler colonial roots may seem
clear. But **[[even multiracial and transnational queer critiques of
racism and imperialism can erase native people]{.mark} and naturalize
settler colonialism]{.underline}** [in ways that indirectly or directly
define queer modernity as not native]{.underline}. This book examines
\"native queer modernities\" as projects that formed historically
precisely to displace the settler colonial logics that sustain
\"non-native queer modernities.\"

#### Theorizations of queerness that don't centralize settler colonialism recreate queer citizenship and homonationalism

**Morgensen 10** \[2010, Scott Lauria Morgensen, SETTLER
HOMONATIONALISM, GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 16,
Number 1-2: 105-131\]

[Modern sexuality arose]{.underline} in the United States [as crucial to
a colonial society of normalization. The violent sexual regulation of
Native peoples became a proving ground for forming settler
subjects]{.underline} as agents and beneficiaries of modern sexuality.
Their subject positions arose relationally within the colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality and call for broad analysis in queer,
American, and Native studies. 40 I now ask how colonial histories made
settlement a primary condition of the formation of modern queer subjects
and politics in the United States. I reexamine scholarship in queer
studies that suggests this claim, and I mark how future queer
scholarship can center the study of settler colonialism, including as a
condition of homonationalism. Settler colonialism is the open secret in
most historical work in U.S. sexuality studies and queer studies.
[[Settler colonialism **conditioned every aspect of**]{.mark} **the
history of [sexuality in the United States]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
only rarely has it been made a focus of study. My account has suggested
a convergence between the sexual colonization of Native peoples and the
growth in the United States of techniques of modern sexuality. These
proliferated in the decades following the frontier's "closure," a time
that in fact represented a heyday of state and religious efforts to
institute a colonial education of desire, as in the events at the Crow
Agency or during the 1879 -- 1918 tenure of the Carlisle Indian School.
Far from reflecting finality, this period witnessed tense negotiations
of active and contested settlement. In such a time, any iteration of
modern sexuality that placed Native people in the past knew itself to be
a contingent claim that remained open to challenge. Thus scholars must
recognize that modern sexuality is not a product of settler colonialism,
as if it came into being in the United States after settlement
transpired. Modern sexuality arose in the United States as a method to
produce [settler colonialism, and settler subjects, by facilitating
ongoing conquest and naturalizing its effects. The normative function of
[settlement is]{.mark} to appear inevitable and final]{.underline}. [It
is n[aturalized again **whenever**]{.mark} **sexuality or queer studies
[scholars inscribe it as an unexamined backdrop to]{.mark} the
historical formation of [modern U.S. sexual
cultures]{.mark}**]{.underline} and politics. Scholars in Native and
American studies have theorized settler colonialism as the social
processes and narratives that displace Native people while granting
settlers belonging to Native land and settler society. With Renée
Bergland and James Cox, I examine how this displacement is enabled by
settler narratives of Native absence or disappearance.41 Both terms
share a quality of invoking the very thing being argued as not present.
Stories of Native absence or disappearance thus precisely do not erase
Native people but produce particular forms of knowledge about Native
people, as already or inevitably gone. Cox argues that tales of Native
disappearance should also be read as narratives of settlement. The very
absence of Native people in a story is telling us a story about
qualities of settler subjects, cultures, and social life. Queer
scholarship on race and sexuality has been effective at marking colonial
relations and discourses and inviting the study of settlement. Scholars
reveal that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, sexual
sciences and civil institutions distinguished primitive from civilized
sexuality in order to define queer margins for sexual normality. Eithne
Luibhéid and Roderick Ferguson explain how Asian immigrants and
conquered Mexicans after the midnineteenth century, and African
Americans during slavery and the Jim Crow society, were produced as
racial and sexual populations for national regulation.42 Queers of color
in such contexts were targeted for control, but as emblems of entire
racial populations to be queered as the primitive margins of national
whiteness and its civilizational sexuality.43 In turn, Jennifer Terry
and George Chauncey, among others, explain how sexual sciences
classified perversions by documenting white subjects as degenerates who
had regressed to prior stages of racial evolution. 44 In early activism,
white sexual minorities reversed discourse on sexual primitivity in
order to embrace it as a nature deserving recognition by modern
citizenship. In the United States, Harry Hay organized the Mattachine
Society by referencing stories of berdache as the primitive nature of
sexual minorities and as a primitive model of acceptance that modern
societies could emulate --- themes that were sustained in homophile and
gay and lesbian civil rights activism.45 Each such moment is illuminated
by its relation to settlement. As Luibhéid's remarkable historical
research suggests, the structural locations of non- Native people of
color within the biopolitics of modern sexuality in the colonial and
imperial United States align with those assigned to Native peoples by
sexual colonization.46 Their distinctive encounters with racial and
sexual power thus may be examined as interrelated effects of the United
States forming as a colonial power through processes of settlement. Yet
studying their ties also will mark the many nonidentical locations
occupied by non-Natives, including queers of color, in relation to
Native people under colonial conditions of settlement. In turn[,
[white]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[sexual minorities who defended their
sexual primitivity **articulated normative practices of settler
citizenship**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Philip Deloria and Amy Kaplan have
examined settler citizenship as based on the conquest and incorporation
of primitivity, so that primitivity becomes a resource to be drawn on
when asserting the unique strengths of a settler civilization.47 Modern
sexuality discourses also taught white U.S. American men to tap and
control their primitive roots, as when G. Stanley Hall's recapitulation
theory of play or youth health movements in the YMCA invited white youth
to explore primitive developmental stages so as to become civilized
adults with virile sex and sexuality.48 White U.S. sexual minorities
thus organized in a political culture that already validated a journey
to personhood and citizenship that translated primitive roots into
settler modernity. Defending primitive sexual nature, which could
include appropriating Native American culture as part of their history,
translated their queer marginality into a normative assertion of settler
citizenship. Focusing on settlement also marks the way that theories of
degeneration assigned to modern queers in the early-twentieth-century
United States presumed Native disappearance. As degenerates, [modern
queers appeared as failed subjects, incapable of representing either
white civilization or authentic primitivity]{.underline}. Yet [this
framing **also naturalized them across racial differences as
non-Native**]{.underline}, in that it presumed that authentic Native
people had already disappeared from the modern and settled spaces where
queer degenerates would be found. If living Native people ever did
appear in those spaces, they tended to present as out of place. For
instance, Nayan Shah's compelling history of sexuality and migration
cites a California police report from 1918, which criminalized a
relationship between a South Asian migrant man and an American Indian
youth by narrating it as sexual predation. This regulatory moment
occurred amid recent histories of scalp bounties and massacres targeting
Native peoples across Northern California, including only two years
after the death of Ishi, famed survivor of the Yahi tribe. How might
popular narratives of lost Native authenticity have shaped the police
description of the youth only by his town of origin (Truckee) and his
assimilation into a multiracial underclass? How, still, might tales of
sexual primitivity persist, as his framing as the passive object of his
racialized partner's desire suggests (without naming) the logic of
berdache? 49 In turn, Siobhan Somerville and Kevin Mumford have shown
how popular stories and social practices in the early twentieth century
linked homosexuality to miscegenation, including representing it as
emblematic of white "slumming" for sexual adventure in African American
districts of New York City and Chicago.50 Yet in the Northeast,
blackness already connoted historical miscegenation with Indianness. Amy
den Ouden has explained how in the wake of normative associations of
Native people with blackness in New England, Native communities with
black family lines could be marked by white authorities as racially
inauthentic, thereby delegitimating their Native identities and land
claims. In light of this, by the early twentieth century, how did
discourses on sexual perversion tie Indianness and blackness to
homosexuality, and how did they interlink? Did the histories of
black-Indian communities and of their regulation shape modern racial
theories of homosexuality? What would a queer history of homosexuality
and miscegenation look like if Indianness --- as an identity, or an
object of colonial discourse --- were crucial to analysis?51 [[Queer
studies **must center settler colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
processes of settlement in order to pursue these directions in
scholarship. Settler colonialism appears in the relational of colonial
and modern sexual regimes; in narratives of sexuality and gender based
on Native absence and disappearance, despite evidence of Native survival
and resistance; and in the normative formation of settler sexual
subjects, cultures, and politics. I argue that queer **[[accounts of
settler colonialism will be supported by studying the colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The frame of
colonial biopolitics makes the discursive and institutional
relationality of Native and settler subject positions relevant to any
account of modern sexuality in the United States. While such accounts
have tended to exclude Native people, biopolitics marks erasure as
meaningful to narrating settlement, even as that move can be
investigated for evidence of the irruption of Native people amid stories
of their demise. The frame of colonial biopolitics will also mark how
the power relations structuring "Native" and "settler" articulate
diverse people, cultures, and politics across differences of race,
nation, class, disability, gender, and sexuality that exceed these two
terms and their opposition. Yet the normativity of the terms within
colonial biopolitics will still inform every U.S. formation of modern
sexuality. Studying their relationality can recall that the locations
they define for Native people always are exceeded by the discrepant
histories and epistemologies of Native people's interdependent and
resistant lives. In turn, the term non-Native can help mark how subjects
outside Native communities incompletely fit the term settler --- whether
excluded from it categorically or asked to pass through or appeal to it
--- as they negotiate varied non-Native lives in a settler society.
Differences among non-Native people of color, or between them and white
people, thus will not be erased by marking their shared inheritance of
settler colonialism; indeed, doing so will mark those differences, even
as their distinctive relationships to settler colonialism and its
naturalization become relevant to study.52 In the process, analyzing the
colonial biopolitics of modern sexuality will focus queer studies on the
work of denaturalizing settlement. I mean here not just that settler
colonialism will be marked as a condition of all modern sexual power in
the United States but also that the meaningfulness of its naturalization
will become a major area of study. We need many more, and more detailed
accounts of the subjects, institutions, and power relations that form
whenever settler colonialism is naturalized within modern queer projects
in the United States. [My argument invites scholars to return to
**[homonationalism]{.mark} and explain it as [one crucial effect of the
settler histories of modern sexuality]{.mark}** [in the United
States]{.mark}. We will see that if [non-Native queers become sexual
subjects]{.mark} of life, **they will do so [by joining a colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality that functions to produce modern queers
as settler subjects]{.mark} in relation to Native
peoples**]{.underline}. Normatively white and national queer politics
will arise here by naturalizing settler colonialism, notably when
appeals to the settler state fail to trouble its colonial relation to
Native peoples and its enforcement of a settler society.53 To invoke
Puar, the settler formation of U.S. queer projects will make them "queer
as regulatory" over Native peoples, whose social lives will appear
distant in time and space despite the continued existence of collective
and allied Native activisms for decolonization and calls to non-Natives
to join. Homonationalism will arise here, where the historical and
contemporary activity of settler colonialism conditions queer
modernities in the United States.
