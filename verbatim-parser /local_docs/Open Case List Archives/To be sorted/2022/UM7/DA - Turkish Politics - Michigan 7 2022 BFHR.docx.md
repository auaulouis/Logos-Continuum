# Erdoğan Disadvantage

## NOTES

The thesis of the DA is that Erdogan (the president of Turkey) is facing
a lot of backlash now because of the economy. That normally would TKO
the DA on uniqueness, but the trick is that the way he's dealing that is
ramping up anti-NATO rhetoric and actions to divert the attention of the
Turkish public. The AFF would be a flip flop by having him accept
American aid and cooperation, which would cause a) him not be able to
campaign on this and b) cause his base to backlash. In order to regain
support with his constituents, he will start a war with Greece which
escalates.

Links and thumpers --- this DA is based around generic cooperation, most
of the AT: Thumpers (in the link section) are also independent link
arguments you can make. If you are trying to diversify, look there even
if they don't read the thumper

One strength of the argument is that NATO cohesion is absolutely wrecked
by a Turkey-Greece war.

One weakness of this argument is that if Turkey says no to the plan,
there is no DA link and there's potentially a link turn.

[Between stalling Sweden and Finland's bids for NATO
membership]{.underline} and threatening a fresh military offensive
against Kurds in northern Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan
seems to be capitalising on the world's focus on Ukraine to strengthen
Ankara's geopolitical standing]{.underline} -- even **[at the expense of
NATO and Western partners]{.underline}**. [Such moves]{.underline} may
be **[target]{.underline}**ing [**a domestic audience** ahead of June
2023 presidential elections, **with Erdogan trying to galvanise
nationalist sentiment as a worsening economic crisis threatens his
popularity at home.**]{.underline}

In recent weeks, [Erdogan has once again complicated Turkey's
relationship with its NATO allies]{.underline} -- stalling Swedish and
Finnish plans to join the bloc; threatening another military incursion
into northern Syria; refusing to join Western sanctions against Russia;
and reviving tensions with perennial rival Greece over the Aegean
islands.

The [Turkish president]{.underline} seems keen to take advantage of the
West's focus on the Ukraine war, [using]{.underline} bellicose [rhetoric
in defence of Turkey's interests **and imposing his own conditions on
top of European and US priorities.**]{.underline}

Talks in Brussels on Monday on the latest NATO accession bids led to
"clear progress" on some issues, a Finnish presidential aide said. But
Turkey threw a spanner into the works -- demanding Sweden and Finland
take action against the \"terrorists\" of the Kurdistan Workers\' Party
(PKK) before approving their accession -- ahead of next week's NATO
summit in Madrid.

Erdogan is all too aware that Swedish and Finnish accession would be a
landmark expansion for the transatlantic alliance, with both nations
jettisoning their longstanding Cold War neutrality amid a re-emergent
Russian threat.

'Imposing his agenda'

Ankara sees both countries -- and Sweden, especially -- as too close to
the PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war in Turkey since 1984
punctuated by periodic ceasefires. A militant insurgency that dreams of
an independent Kurdish state uniting southeastern Turkey, northern
Syria, northern Iraq and a small slice of northeastern Iran, the PKK has
been designated a terrorist group by both the EU and the United States.

Erdogan says he wants "concrete" and "serious" steps from Sweden and
Finland before he allows them into NATO. In effect, he wants them to
bargain with him directly to get the green light.

The Turkish president also wants Western countries to lift the
restrictions on arms and technology exports imposed in late 2019 after a
Turkish attack on Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The Kurdish People's
Protection Units (YPG) were instrumental in defeating the Islamic State
group in Syria and a key ally of the US-led international coalition
battling the jihadists.

"By raising the prospect of a new offensive against Kurdish forces in
northern Syria and threatening to block Sweden's and Finland's NATO
applications, [Erdogan is trying to show that he won't compromise on
Turkish nationalist causes]{.underline} -- [and that he can impose **his
agenda and priorities** in the international arena]{.underline}," said
David Rigoulet-Roze, a Middle East specialist at the IRIS (French
Institute for International and Strategic Affairs) think-tank in Paris.

Moreover, [Erdogan is "trying to]{.underline} [**compensate for his
disastrous management of the Turkish economy**, to shore up
his]{.underline} **[electoral base]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[mobilise voters]{.underline}** [ahead of the forthcoming elections,
which look rather complicated for him"]{.underline}, Rigoulet-Roze
continued.

'Like a poker player'

With both presidential and parliamentary elections coming up in a year's
time, Erdogan's geopolitical chess game with the West could well offer
him an electoral boon.

A German Marshall Fund poll published in April showed that 58.3 percent
of Turks see the US as the "biggest threat" to Turkey's "national
interests" while 62.4 percent believe European countries want to "divide
and disintegrate Turkey as they had the Ottoman Empire in the past". An
even bigger number, 69.8 percent, believe European countries have helped
strengthen separatist organisations like the PKK.

"[Erdogan is]{.underline} a real [political]{.underline} animal; **[he
acts like a poker player on the world stage,"]{.underline}** said
Rigoulet-Roze. "[But there's]{.underline} often **[a domestic agenda
lurking behind his games with the West]{.underline}** -- [and his
various postures in the global arena are nothing]{.underline} **[more
than a response to domestic problems and a reflection of his desire to
keep his grip on power."]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} Turkish [president is more than happy to pursue
policies with an eye on the domestic agenda even if it means irritating
the West]{.underline} -- as witnessed in recent years by the decision to
drill in disputed parts of the Mediterranean and the controversial
purchase of an S-400 missile system from Russia.

[Erdogan makes such moves **on an "ad-hoc" basis**]{.underline},
Rigoulet-Roze said, instead of working from an overarching strategy.

"For the most part, they're provocative acts -- Erdogan knows he can't
burn bridges with the West or remake the world on his terms."

Indeed, Erdogan is all too aware that the EU is still Turkey's largest
trading partner (it is part of the customs union) and that the US became
Turkey's third-largest export market in 2020.

'Extremely vulnerable'

More recently, [Erdogan has refused to join Western sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}. Ankara does not want to "antagonise Russia" because
the beleaguered Turkish economy is "extremely vulnerable" to a loss of
Russian wheat and energy supplies, according to Howard Eissenstat, a
Turkey specialist at St. Lawrence University in New York and the Middle
East Institute in Washington, DC, speaking in a March interview.

[Erdogan also riled Western leaders over the past few weeks]{.underline}
by hosting Venezuela's autocratic far-left President Nicolas Maduro for
talks on June 8; neither the EU nor the United States recognises
Maduro's regime as legitimate.

A further provocation to the West came in early June, when the Turkish
president announced he would end regular bilateral meetings with the
Greek government aimed at building co-operation after decades of
antagonism between these historic enemies. Ankara claims that Athens is
stationing troops on Aegean islands near the Turkish shore in violation
of peace treaties and has threatened to reopen a debate on ownership of
the islands.

"[On the surface it sometimes looks like Erdogan is the master of this
game against the West]{.underline} -- but **[in reality he's testing
them each time]{.underline}**, [seeing how far he can go, seeing if he
can make some sort of geopolitical win]{.underline} on the regional
chessboard or an economic win to try and relieve the financial pressure
Turkey is under," Rigoulet-Roze said. "[Erdogan's]{.underline} position
isn't as comfortable as it looks, because he **[risks really
antagonising all the other NATO members and making Turkey the black
sheep of the alliance."]{.underline}**

Erdogan is trying to make Turkey a great power again -- on the global as
well as regional stage.

"Erdogan is very nostalgic for Ottoman imperial grandeur, which has a
profound resonance in the contemporary Turkish psyche -- this idea that
Turkey must once again be recognised as a great power, even if it can't
have an empire," Rigoulet-Roze said. "Unfortunately for Erdogan, reality
constrains these ambitions, because Turkey's considerable economic
difficulties mean it can't afford to be isolated."

Over the previous two decades, Erdogan's moderate Islamist Justice and
Development Party (AKP) has won and kept power because it "assured Turks
of sustained improvements in living standards", Rigoulet-Roze said.

But that [reputation for economic competence is gone]{.underline},
**[putting Erdogan at odds with millions of transactional
voters]{.underline}** he has relied on for support. Hence his diplomatic
overtures to the wealthy Gulf petro-monarchies he previously scorned.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman began his first official visit to
Turkey on Wednesday, with several agreements expected between the two
Middle Eastern powers. Erdogan went to Saudi Arabia at the end of April
after three and a half years of vexed relations between Ankara and
Riyadh following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

For all his troubles, Erdogan knows that Turkey's geographic location --
at the crossroads of Europe, the Black Sea, the Caucasus and the Middle
East -- makes it essential to the West from a strategic perspective. The
Cold War is long gone, but the factors that motivated NATO to make
Turkey the only Middle Eastern member of the Alliance in 1952 have not
gone away. As much as Erdogan's threats to the Swedish and Finnish
accession bids rile NATO members, they know they need to engage with
him.

But [while much remains the same, **the nature of Turkish politics has
changed a great deal since the Cold War,**]{.underline} Rigoulet-Roze
observed. [Back then, Turkey was "]{.underline}secular, anti-communist,
[pro-Western and pro-European]{.underline}; **[things have become very
different since Erdogan and the AKP took power]{.underline}**, [making
Turkey into a nation dominated by]{.underline} **[an Islamo-nationalist
party that is, at the very least, non-aligned"]{.underline}**.

#### NATO cooperation [decimates]{.underline} Erdogan's support

**Tremblay 22 ---** Pinar Tremblay Professor in the Economics department
at California State Polytechnic University - Pomona (Brendan Tremblays
mom lol) \"Turkish public support for NATO declines,\" Al-Monitor,
3-8-2022,
https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/turkish-public-support-nato-declines,
accessed 6-20-2022 WMK

Public opinion also seems to support President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's
policy on the conflict. Indeed, [perceptions of NATO in
Turkey]{.underline} **[are rather negative]{.underline}**, even at a
time when countries like Finland and Sweden are considering joining the
organization.

While there have not been polls on support for NATO since the invasion
began, in recent years [Turkey has]{.underline} **[consistently ranked
as having the lowest support for NATO among member
states.]{.underline}**

In January 2022, Metropoll polling agency released an interesting
finding. When asked the question, \"In its foreign policy, should Turkey
give priority to Russia and China or to the US and the EU?" 39.4% opted
for the Russia and China options, while 37.5% said the EU and the US.
And recent statements by various figures seem to indicate [sentiments
are not changing.]{.underline}

For example, a Turkish businessman known for his outspoken love for
Erdogan traveled to Moscow last week, where he [described]{.underline}
**[NATO as a "cancer."]{.underline}**

Speaking to Russian media, Ethem Sancak, who is a former member of
Erdogan\'s ruling party, also accused NATO of supporting coups against
the various Turkish governments, including the 2016 coup attempt against
Erdogan's government.

Sancak also claimed that Turkey "did not know" that the combat drones
supplied to Ukraine by Turkey "would be used like this\" against Russia.

So far, there has been no comment on Sancak's remarks from ruling party
officials in Turkey.

Yet [anti-NATO sentiment is]{.underline} **[prevailing in large segments
of Turkish society]{.underline}** [from both sides of the political
spectrum.]{.underline}

Erkan Bas, the leader of the leftist Turkey Workers Party
([TIP]{.underline}), also [described the alliance]{.underline} **[as a
terrorist organization]{.underline}** while he was calling for peace in
Ukraine. [The sentiment has been growing steadily]{.underline} in the
last decade.

Indeed, at a time when foreign policy experts question whether Erdogan's
"both Russia and Ukraine are our friends" policy is sustainable, there
are divisions within the ruling party bigwigs as well.

While Erdogan's son-in-law's family, the manufacturer of the Bayraktar
drones supplied to Ukraine, openly supports Ukraine and stands up
against the invasion, [Erdogan's]{.underline} **[ultranationalist allies
rally for Russia]{.underline}**.

[**Not much support for NATO** comes from Islamists, ultranationalists
or leftists.]{.underline} Rather, **[anyone who might dare to make a
positive comment about NATO could be placed under the label
"pro-American" or a "foreign agent."]{.underline}**

Indeed, 2019 PEW research reveals that [the Turkish public has the
**lowest favorable ratings of NATO among member states**]{.underline},
[with only]{.underline} **[21% of those polled stating a positive view
of the alliance.]{.underline}** In the same year, non-NATO member
countries such as Ukraine and Sweden held 53% and 63% favorable ratings
of the organization, respectively.

**[There is only one non-NATO country, Russia, where the public holds a
less favorable rating]{.underline}** **[of NATO than
Turkey]{.underline}**, with 16%.

The [Turkish public's low-level approval]{.underline} of NATO **[has
been consistently the lowest]{.underline}** among member countries since
2011, according to PEW, [ranging between 15% to 25%. PEW's findings
confirm left and right uniting in their disdain of NATO.]{.underline}

What are the causes of this unfavorability of the organization?

Political scientist Burak Ozpek told Al-Monitor one of the potent
reasons is the lack of credible information about NATO in the news.

"[Populist politicians]{.underline} and even academics [appear on TV
making rather childish and slogan-styled comments about international
relations]{.underline}. Media is overrun by these appearances. [We do
not hear the facts. We do not hear NATO is a security alliance. We do
not hear Turkey is a long-time member. We do not hear the benefits of
being a NATO member]{.underline}. In the last couple of years,
**[anti-American rhetoric is on the rise]{.underline}** **[in Turkish
politics]{.underline}** and authoritarian tendencies find support in
Russia," Ozpek told Al-Monitor. "[All the marginal voices about NATO and
conspiracy theories]{.underline} **[have become
mainstream.]{.underline}** Hence, now the invasion of Ukraine is not
perceived as a smaller state being attacked by a stronger one, but
rather a battle between NATO and Russia."

Despite not being a top security priority, [Greek-Turkish
relations]{.underline} **[are]{.underline}** still
[regarded]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} **[serious external
threat]{.underline}** in Ankara (Gürsoy 2017:6). The Aegean dispute,
especially [contests over territorial waters and airspace]{.underline},
is present in every Turkish National Security Policy Document (Gürcanli
2014). Moreover, a [series of surveys]{.underline} between 2017 and 2019
reveal that **[43.2% of Turks consider Greece a threat to
Turkey]{.underline}** and [59.7% oppose mending the Greek-Turkish
relations]{.underline} (Aydin et al. 2020:66--69). The importance of
Greece in Turkish strategic considerations is also evident from the
[increased number of **airspace violations**]{.underline} throughout the
last decade. Violations of the Greek-claimed airspace offer significant
benefits to Ankara, both internationally and domestically. In the
international arena, the continued Turkish objection to the status of
the Aegean islands will be helpful for future negotiations or
arbitration since they act as a proof of Turkish claims in the region.
Additionally, [airspace violations bring the issue of territory on the
bilateral agenda]{.underline} to force [Greece to acknowledge the
dispute over the island status and engage wit]{.underline}h it. What's
more, airspace incursions serve as Ankara's direct challenge to Greek
sovereignty over the area and are seen as part of long-term planning to
'Finlandize' Greece and Cyprus (Williams 2010; Ifantis and
Triantaphyllou 2018). Internationally, the airspace violations thus
[serve as a tool to project Turkish sovereignty claims]{.underline} on
the contested territory. **[Domestically]{.underline}**, the
**[incursions]{.underline}** [may allow the ruling party]{.underline} to
**[gain points with its constituents.]{.underline}** Particularly in the
last years, the [AKP has become]{.underline} **[challenged electorally
and had to accept the ultranationalist MHP as junior coalition
partner]{.underline}** (Ulgen 2018). Likewise, the Turkish economy has
stagnated and inflation is soaring. [In]{.underline} such [times
of]{.underline} **[domestic challenges,]{.underline}** [governments have
an]{.underline} **[incentive for diversionary behaviour,]{.underline}**
**[and given the historic rivalry]{.underline}**, [Greece is
a]{.underline} **[particularly likely target for Turkish acts of
diversion]{.underline}** (Mitchell and Prins 2004; Mitchell and Thyne
2010, Tir 2020). To that end, Mehrl and Choulis (2021) find that the
number of [Turkish incursions in the Greek-claimed airspace]{.underline}
**[increases when leader approval ratings are low.]{.underline}**
[Incursions into the contested airspace may thus also serve as acts of
diversion for Ankara]{.underline}, [benefitting its domestic
position]{.underline}. Turkish incursions in the Greek claimed airspace
also enable the Turkish armed forces to gather data on Greek air
defences, such as response times, that may be useful for future military
endeavours. Consequently, as long as the risk of an escalatory response
is sufficiently low, the costs of Turkish **[airspace incursions, namely
operational costs and potential accidents, are outweighed by the
benefits.]{.underline}**

#### Greece war goes [nuclear]{.underline} -- accidental and intentional escalation is likely 

**Psaropoulos 18** (John Psaropoulos, independent journalist based in
Athens, with two decades of experience covering Greece, Cyprus and
southeast Europe. Freelance correspondent for Al Jazeera International,
NPR, the Daily Beast and others; "Greece vs. Turkey: Are We Headed for
an Intra-NATO War?"; Washington Examiner; 3/28/18;
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/greece-vs-turkey-are-we-headed-for-an-intra-nato-war
kp)

The [Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey hosts one of the world's
**highest concentrations** of **high-tech weaponry**. Sixty-seven
surface ships and two dozen submarines are deployed on a body of water
the size of Lake Superior]{.underline}. The [two air forces command 448
fighter jets armed with **smart bombs** and **guided
missiles**]{.underline}. On land, 832 heavy tanks and more than 2,500
lighter artillery vehicles---[as much tank firepower as in all the
**rest of Europe** **combined**]{.underline}---could rapidly be brought
to bear along a Greek-Turkish border only 105 miles long.

[These arsenals]{.underline}, built up over decades and constantly
modernized, [were]{.underline} not merely [a boon to U.S. and German
defence contractors]{.underline}. Western policymakers wanted to believe
that loyalty to NATO's mission of containing the USSR, rather than
regional rivalries, motivated this exemplary level of Greek and Turkish
defense spending. After the Soviet Union collapsed, [good
diplomacy]{.underline} and Turkey's EU aspirations [made it possible,
most of the time, to overlook the downsides of an **arms race** between
**uneasy neighbors**. Recently, however, the Aegean has become a
**dangerously narrow sea**.]{.underline}

For decades, [Turkish military aircraft have **regularly violated**
Greece's 10-mile airspace around its islands]{.underline}, on the
grounds that Greece's territorial waters extend only six nautical miles
from shore, and that air and sea borders should match. Turkish ships
also ignore the territorial waters around a number of small islands
whose Greek ownership Turkey questions. These ships and planes are
intercepted by their Greek counterparts, and mock dogfights result.
[Occasionally **fatal accidents** occur.]{.underline}

Kostas [Grivas]{.underline}, who [teaches advanced weapons systems at
the Hellenic Army Academy, calls it a "a unique **theater of
confrontation**," where "land, sea and air forces are simultaneously in
use in a **very confined area**]{.underline}, and there is an enormous
amount of weapons systems and men-at-arms in deployment." [In the event
of war]{.underline}, he believes, [it would be very difficult to
maintain **c**ommand-**and-c**ontrol systems because of the **intensity
and speed** of activity, meaning heavy fratricidal losses]{.underline}.
In such chaos, the outcome might ultimately be up to local commanders'
ability to take intelligent initiatives. [An Aegean war]{.underline},
Grivas says, [would resemble]{.underline} "a mini-[**nuclear war**
because there will be so much high-tech ordnance **discharged** it will
cause a huge amount of **damage**]{.underline}."

The prospect of such hostilities has been suddenly brought closer this
year, following events that are individually and as a series without
parallel in recent decades.

Last autumn, Greek foreign minister Nikos Kotzias expressed concern that
[Turkey had become an "**irritable power**."]{.underline} What inspired
this concern was [a record **3,317 airspace** and **1,998 territorial
water** violations recorded in the Aegean last
year]{.underline}---respectively double and quadruple the previous
year's numbers. "Our job is to behave responsibly," Kotzias declared, so
he invited Recep Tayyip Erdogan to become the first Turkish president in
six decades to visit Greece.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan's December 7 visit was a disaster. On its eve,
Erdogan gave an interview calling for revisions of the Lausanne Treaty
of 1923. This is the treaty that defines the borders of the modern
Turkish state, while guaranteeing the rights of Greek and Muslim
minorities in the two countries. It has kept Greece and Turkey at peace
for a century and forms the bedrock of their détente. No Greek or
Turkish head of state or government had ever publicly called for its
revision. Greece's President Prokopis Pavlopoulos reacted by
overstepping his role as ceremonial head of state to lecture Erdogan.
Lausanne, he asserted, was "non-negotiable."

\"It has no gaps. It needs neither revision nor updating. It stands as
it is, it covers absolutely the issues that it needs to cover, and
stresses that among other things it leaves no leeway for gray zones or
minority issues,\" Pavlopoulos said.

Erdogan gave as good as he got. Greece had plunged its Muslim minority
into poverty, he said, and is racially prejudiced against it. Erdogan
also demanded of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras the extradition of ten
Turkish military officers who fled to Greece after the failed July 2016
coup. The Greek Supreme Court had barred their extradition on the
grounds that their lives would be endangered in Turkey. The government
cannot overrule the decision and there is no higher court of appeal, but
Erdogan insisted: "What I told Mr. Tsipras is that these putschists may
be returned to Turkey, a country that has abolished the death penalty, a
country where torture does not take place."

Kotzias's charm offensive has since collapsed. A planned February
revival of the Greek-Turkish Supreme Council, a diplomatic forum, never
took place, and a May visit to Athens by the Turkish foreign minister is
very much in doubt. But there is worse.

On February 12, a Turkish coast guard vessel rammed a Greek one while
performing what the Greek coast guard called "dangerous maneuvers
inconsistent with international collision avoidance practices." Turkish
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim called Tsipras to explain that the
ramming was accidental; but the fact that it happened near Imia, a pair
of Greek islets whose ownership Turkey has disputed for 20 years,
suggests to the Greeks a territorial power play.

Turkey upped the ante on the last day of February, arresting two Greek
officers who apparently strayed into Turkish territory while on a
routine patrol on the Thracian border. The standard practice for both
sides during the last three decades has been to return wayward patrols
at the nearest checkpoint after a routine procedure. Turkish authorities
instead jailed the men and charged them with illegal entry. More serious
charges may follow. Greek Defense minister Panos Kammenos refers to the
two soldiers as "hostages," and Greek public opinion takes for granted
their seizure as connected with the ten Turkish military fugitives.

Since these incidents, polls say [**92 percent** of Greeks believe
Turkey constitutes Greece's **biggest threat**]{.underline}. Is Turkey
generating grievances as a pretext for war? Who would gain from such a
war? How would America react? And why has Erdogan chosen this moment to
escalate tension?

Brinkmanship in 1996: preview of a far worse confrontation?

"[What I worry about is]{.underline} the [risk of an **unintentional
confrontation**]{.underline}," says U.S. ambassador to Athens Geoffrey
Pyatt. Greece and Turkey nearly did stumble into war two decades ago. On
Christmas Day 1995, the Figen Akat, [a small Turkish cargo ship, ran
aground on the western twin islet of **Imia**]{.underline}. A [Greek tug
was dispatched to refloat her, but the Turkish captain refused Greek
help]{.underline}, saying he was in Turkish territorial waters. He
eventually accepted Greek assistance, but not before the Turkish
government had voiced a claim to the Imia islets as Turkish.

In the new year, the mayor of the largest nearby Greek island, Kalymnos,
hoisted a Greek flag on Imia. The owners of a newly-licensed Turkish
television channel CNN Turk decided to boost ratings by filming two
journalists replacing the Greek flag with a Turkish one. Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller fueled the fire. "We can't let a foreign flag fly on
Turkish soil. The flag will come down," she said.

"The Turkish claims have no basis at all. There is no space for
negotiations in ... matters which concern our sovereignty," said Greek
Premier Kostas Simitis. Greece landed special forces on one of the two
islets while Turkish frogmen took the other. As many as 20 Greek and
Turkish ships and submarines converged on Imia (or Kardik, as the Turks
call it).

On January 31, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[intervened]{.underline}** to avert an unintended war. "In 1996 the
Americans stepped in and that sobered both sides," says retired
ambassador Christos Rozakis, one of Greece's leading experts on
international law. "We parted under the understanding, "no ships, no
flags," and reverted to the status quo ante. It wasn't exactly that, but
until the latest incident it was almost that. Greek shepherds didn't
herd their goats there any more, but neither did Turks go there."

Treaties vs. politics

[Imia stands as a textbook case of **calculated escalation** leading to
the brink of an **unintended war**, and conditions now are even **more
conducive** to such a war than they were in 1996, because **new causes**
of **instability** have been added]{.underline} to older ones.

## Uniqueness

### UQ --- Erdogan Support Fine

#### Erdogan popularity is [sufficiently high]{.underline} now. His [anti-Western]{.underline} rhetoric and actions are boosting public support.

**Ghitis 6-16**-2022, world affairs columnist and a regular contributor
to CNN and The Washington Post (Frida, "Sensing Opportunity, Erdogan Is
Back to Playing the Spoiler," World Politics Review,
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/30615/under-erdogan-turkey-is-back-to-playing-the-spoiler)//BB>

[So what exactly is going on with Ankara's foreign policy?]{.underline}

[To understand Erdogan's]{.underline} seemingly contradictory
[maneuvers, it's important to notice the calendar, the polls, the
economy and the current state of geopolitics]{.underline}.

[Presidential elections are scheduled for exactly one year from this
week, on June 18, 2023. With Turkey's economy
limping]{.underline}---partly as a result of the explosive inflation
rates produced by Erdogan's own misguided monetary meddling---[the polls
show the president's Justice and Development Party **neck-and-neck**
with the opposition]{.underline}. In this context, the effort to repair
Turkey's relations with neighbors was partly driven by the need to boost
foreign investment. Erdogan also wanted to avoid being excluded from an
emerging new alliance in the Middle East that includes regional economic
powers like Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

And yet, **[openly irking the West]{.underline}** and defying former
rivals **[is]{.underline}** still **[effective in boosting support at
home]{.underline}**. Crucially, [Erdogan now finds himself in possession
of **valuable new leverage**]{.underline}. Turkey's hand has been
strengthened by Russian President Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine,
which has unified NATO in a way nothing had in decades. Supporting
Ukraine and denying a victory to Putin has become NATO's most urgent
priority---but the alliance operates by consensus. That means that
Turkey, which has long played an obstructionist role in NATO, is
suddenly in a position to make demands.

A [narrow majority of respondents]{.underline} of a public survey
conducted by the Ankara-based Metropoll company [believe]{.underline}
that incumbent President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan would not win
re-election]{.underline} if a presidential vote had been held in May.

\"Would Erdoğan win re-election if the presidential election was held
this Sunday?\" was the question asked to respondents in Metropoll\'s
\"Turkey\'s Pulse\" survey conducted in May.

A **[slight majority]{.underline}** of respondents, [49
percent]{.underline}, [said they believed Erdoğan would not win
re-election, while 46 percent said they thought he would]{.underline}.
Most undecided voters also felt Erdoğan would not win re-election.

Erdoğan was first elected president for a five-year renewable term in
2014 by a direct vote under the parliamentary system. Turkey switched to
presidential system of governance with a referendum in 2017 and held
snap presidential and parliamentary polls in 2018, when Erdoğan was
elected president again.

[Metropoll has been asking people regularly]{.underline} since August
2020 [about their views concerning Erdoğan\'s chances of winning the
next presidential election.]{.underline}

Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party ([AKP]{.underline}) [have
been losing public support in public surveys]{.underline} at a time when
a staggeringly high cost of living has become the new normal in Turkey,
where recent increases in food and utility prices are pushing up
inflation, further crippling the purchasing power of citizens.

#### Ignore polls---lack of opposition unity and election reform boosts Erdogan

[Turkey\'s parliament passed a law]{.underline} [reducing the threshold
for votes won in the general election for a party to enter parliament
from 10% to 7]{.underline}% on 30 March and President Erdogan gave his
approval on 6 April.

This [change]{.underline} **[suits the MHP]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[parliamentary ally of AKP.]{.underline}** This is
because the [MHP\'s support in opinion polls has dropped below the old
10% threshold]{.underline} to nearer 8%.

[The next election is due before June 2023]{.underline}. When the bill
[was initially presented in mid-March it was expected that it would take
a year]{.underline}, once the bill became law, for it to come into
effect. **[This makes an early election unlikely]{.underline}**.

[The ongoing economic crisis gives]{.underline} **[the opposition a
chance]{.underline}** [to defeat]{.underline} President
[Erdogan]{.underline} and the AKP-MHP parliamentary coalition, **[but
only if they unite first.]{.underline}**

The [evidence for that unification **is patchy**]{.underline}. The
[joint declaration]{.underline} on 28 February by six opposition parties
-- including the largest, the CHP -- to campaign for a shift back to a
parliamentary system, [was a start]{.underline}. [But the third-largest
party]{.underline}, the pro-Kurdish HDP, **[was absent.]{.underline}**

The [largest opposition party]{.underline}, the CHP, [has three
politicians with opinion poll support that, in aggregate, matches that
of Erdogan]{.underline}. But **[as yet there is no sign of clear unity
behind one of them.]{.underline}**

Investors cannot be confident yet that an opposition presidential
candidate and parliamentary coalition that espouse a return to orthodox
monetary policy and are competitive enough to unseat Erdogan and the AKP
are in place. And [this electoral law change]{.underline} **[makes the
opposition\'s challenge tougher.]{.underline}**

Erdogan and the central bank seem resolute in their aversion to rate
hikes and that means the disinflation process is likely to be slow and
painful. Rising political pressure and the deteriorating inflation and
current account outlook are unlikely to be sufficient to prompt a policy
reversal.

Without a full-blown currency or balance of payments crisis, we think
such a shift is unlikely, and any tightening would more likely rely on
unconventional methods rather than direct rate hikes.

Against this backdrop, we maintain our Sell recommendation on the TRY,
TRY-denominated government debt, and cannot ground a sustainable
investment case in Turkish equities. 5x forward PE and 5% forward
dividend yield are not that appealing when the most recent inflation
reading is over 60%.

**[Lower election threshold suits AKP]{.underline}**-MHP

The [MHP won 11% of votes in the 2018 election]{.underline}, but its
[support in opinion polls has dropped to nearer 8%.]{.underline}
**[Hence the reduction of the legal threshold to 7% works in the
AKP-MHP\'s favour.]{.underline}**

However, [there also are]{.underline} **[obstacles]{.underline}** in
[the way of opposition parties winning the next elections.]{.underline}
[There still is not a **common presidential candidate against
Erdoğan**]{.underline}. Akşener is the only leader who has openly stated
that she would not be a presidential candidate and that she prefers
becoming the prime minister in the new parliamentary system. As the
leader of the main opposition party, Kılıçdaroğlu is the opposition's
most likely candidate who could be trusted to oversee the dismantlement
of Erdoğan's presidential system and its replacement with a
parliamentary one. However, [in a country that is heavily polarized and
impacted by Erdoğan's narratives]{.underline} emphasizing Sunni Islam,
Kılıçdaroğlu's Alevi identity (Alevis are considered by many from the
Sunni majority as a heterodox group somewhat like the Shia) [makes him a
questionable candidate]{.underline} for conservative Sunnis. The popular
mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoğlu, appears to be interested in
presenting himself as a candidate, while the mayor of Ankara, Mansur
Yavaş, is also cited as a potential contender. Both names performed
better than Kılıçdaroğlu or Erdoğan in recent polls. While the existence
of several viable candidates could be an asset for the opposition, the
[candidate selection process **may open rifts**]{.underline} between the
CHP and İYİ Party.

Another challenge arises from the fact that [there is a **large pool of
undecided voters,**]{.underline} [many of whom **supported AKP and MHP
in the past**]{.underline}. [Although these voters are hurt by the
economic crisis and the government's limited social
assistance]{.underline} during the pandemic, [the opposition parties
**have not yet secured their support**]{.underline}. [Erdoğan still
enjoys **considerable popularity among older voters**]{.underline} [with
a pious background]{.underline} who are [worried about losing the
benefits and privileges]{.underline} they have received under AKP rule.
[In a polarized country where **elections are won or lost with small
margins**]{.underline}, [these voters may determine whether the
**opposition is able to defeat Erdoğan**]{.underline} and win a
sufficient number of seats to secure a transition to the "strengthened
and improved" parliamentary system.

The [toxic and divisive climate that Erdoğan has created]{.underline}
against the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) by associating them with the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Kurdish separatist organization that
now also controls large swaths of northeastern Syria, [makes it
difficult for the opposition to openly engage the pro-Kurdish
party.]{.underline} Yet, [HDP is critical to winning
elections.]{.underline} The [party played a decisive role in defeating
the AKP candidates in the 2019]{.underline} local elections in large
metropolitan centers including Ankara and Istanbul.

[The 2019]{.underline} municipal [elections]{.underline}, coupled with
Turkey's economic hardship over the last couple of months, notably
**[boosted the opposition's confidence]{.underline}**. It is perfectly
normal for any political party (or alliance) to aspire to win the next
election. I maintain, however, that two [phenomena]{.underline} **[have
devastated the psychology of opposition voters]{.underline}**:
Primarily, [those folks]{.underline}, [who engaged in a harsh brand of
opposition and ignored the government's accomplishments]{.underline},
**[have turned their supporters into fanatics]{.underline}**. One could
observe that situation by glancing at pro-opposition news websites: From
their perspective, everything is horrible! Let aside the critique of
inflation or those columnists whose job is to insult others or be
\"doomsday preachers.\" Opposition outlets even portray major projects
such as the indigenously developed electric car Togg and the COVID-19
vaccine Turkovac, or the armed drone program's success and normalization
in foreign policy, as negative developments. Needless to say, [the
opposition's propaganda of uncertainty, concern and imminent
devastation]{.underline}, which incessantly references negative points,
**[undermines the spirit of its own base.]{.underline}**

Misplaced confidence

Secondly, [the opposition's confidence in Erdoğan losing the 2023
election]{.underline} **[translates into exaggeration and
propaganda]{.underline}** [that take a]{.underline} **[toll on their own
voters]{.underline}**. Luckily, [opposition leaders now realize that
their lack of policy proposals and an actual platform]{.underline}
**[cannot be concealed by joining forces on the basis of
anti-Erdoğanism.]{.underline}** That realization, however, gives rise to
another negative and problematic -- albeit more sophisticated -- claim
that the pro-government People's Alliance has run out of tricks and
will, therefore, move to securitize politics or resort to extraordinary
measures. Still, they say, the outcome won't change.

Nowadays, Western media outlets give a platform to those people who go
beyond that speculation and tell their readers stories about the
"collapse\" of Turkish democracy, civil war and a coup d'etat. Of
course, one could not reasonably take issue with the opposition
motivating itself by saying that "we can win unless we make mistakes."
It is a source of concern, however, that [their overblown cockiness
fuels the illusion that]{.underline} "**[the government will resort to
election fraud or reject the outcome instead of stepping down in case of
a loss."]{.underline}** Indeed, [they have already voluntarily dragged
their supporters into the most inescapable pitfall of
polarization]{.underline}. That effort alone [attests to the
opposition's fear that they won't win the 2023 election]{.underline}.

Let us recall that the single most important outcome of the Justice and
Development Party\'s (AK Party) 19 years in power has been to ensure
that the Turkish people, rather than domestic and foreign \"guardians,\"
decide Turkey's future. The campaign is just beginning. [Erdoğan is on
the stage **and he will demonstrate his ability to set the political
agenda in 2022.**]{.underline}

Anti-Imperialism, **[Anti-Westernism]{.underline}**: Varieties of
[Discontent with the West]{.underline}

[As a major driver of Turkey's geopolitical balancing
policy]{.underline}, **[anti-Westernism]{.underline}** or dis­content
with the West has come to mean different things during different times
for Turkey. However, nuance is called for: Dis­content with the West and
anti-Westernism are not necessarily interchangeable. Dis­content tends to
be issue-based, whereas anti-Westernism [describes]{.underline} a more
**[comprehensive political and ideological stance.]{.underline}** Yet an
accumulation of [discontents]{.underline}, as is the case in Turkey,
**[feeds into and sustains the broader anti-Westernism at the elite and
societal levels.]{.underline}** This can make these two terms
indistinguishable at times. Addition­ally, [elites can **exploit
discontent on indi­vidual issues to serve wider anti-Western political
and ideological outlooks**]{.underline}. While there are similarities
between the Turkish and Russian anti-Western narratives, their policy
responses and geopolitical aspirations differ. And that prevents their
respective [anti-Westernism morphing into a]{.underline} shared
**[vision of and stance on the global order.]{.underline}**

There are basically two sides to Turkey's discontent with the West:
political and geo­political. In the [political realm]{.underline} a
**[whole series of political factors]{.underline}** [have driven wedges
between Turkey and the West]{.underline}, and gener­ated mutual
discontent, if not animosity: from Europe's often identity-centric
oppo­sition to Turkey's EU membership to the personalisation of power and
the authoritarian turn in Turkish domestic politics; from the West's
tepid response to the attempted coup of 2016 to the evisceration of the
rule of law in the post-coup era.

Ankara's geopolitical discontent with the West has multiple sources.
Washington's support for the PYD-dominated Syrian Kurds and Turkey's
disputes with the EU and European powers over the Eastern Mediter­ranean
conflict are two major issues. The West, for its part, takes issue with
Turkey's military operations in Syria, its drilling activ­ities in
disputed waters and its military posturing in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Many in the West saw Turkey's acquisition of the Russian S-400 air
defence system as a manifestation of a new geopolitical identity
premised on balancing, rather than merely a defence purchase. It is
noteworthy that Tur­key has recently made moves to purchase military
equipment from Western sources. Turkey reached out to the US to purchase
40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernisation kits for its existing fleets,
and to France and Italy about a potential cooperation on the joint
production of Eurosam SAMP/T defence systems. These initiatives are
important and can be seen as Ankara's indirect recognition of the limits
of its bal­ancing policy, which included defence industry cooperation
with Russia.

Fundamentally, the [current anti-West­ern­ism]{.underline} of both Turkey
and Russia is **[pri­marily US-centric.]{.underline}** Both experience
status [anxiety concerning the]{.underline} US**[/Western-centric
inter­national order]{.underline}**. However, as indicated above, what
matters -- in terms of the im­plications of their anti-Westernism on
their approaches towards the global order-- is the difference in their
policy responses and aspirations.

[Anti-Americanism]{.underline} in Turkey failed --- until
**[recently]{.underline}** --- to **[produce an enduring effect on
Turkish politics]{.underline}**. Unlike other Mediterranean countries
where a legacy of anti Americanism grew out of historical reasons and
had a persistent negative effect on their relations with the United
States, such a trend did not appear in Turkey\'s case.8 With regard to
Spain, a long historical rivalry in Latin America and the Pacific, along
with US support for the authoritarian Franco regime in the aftermath of
World War II, created a legacy of anti-Americanism. In the case of
Greece, US involvement in the civil war (1946-9) and firm US support for
the 1967-74 military regime created a strong popular predisposition
against the United States. Despite the rise of the Turkish left in the
1960s and 1970s, such a legacy of persistent anti-Americanism did not
find fertile ground. This was prob ably because the United States also
had strong allies within Turkey who wielded clout disproportionate to
their numbers, as Turkey\'s influential military and bureaucratic elites
maintained a clear pro-US position. They prioritized Turkey\'s strategic
alliance with the United States and saw it as the strongest security
guarantee for the country as well as its best link to the West. This
became more pronounced after the September 1980 military coup, which
dealt a heavy blow against the Turkish left and political Islam, and
meant that opposition to US policies and the improvement of US-Turkey
relations would be dispersed and politically ineffective. As Turkey\'s
democratic consolidation remained un finished, elites could afford to
dismiss public opinion. The US-Turkey strategic alliance developed to
the point of Turkey forming a regional alliance with Israel in the
1990s, de spite the opposition of a large segment of the Turkish public,
spearheaded by supporters of the Welfare Party (Refah Partisi), which
won a plurality of votes in 1995. This reaction was not considered more
important than the strategic benefits which this alliance would garner
Turkey --- mainly the consolidation of the US-Turkey alliance, access to
military technology, intelligence, and training, improved economic
relations, and a strengthening of its strategic position vis-a-vis
Greece, Syria, Iraq, and Armenia. US policies in the Middle East were
not always popular within Turkish public opinion. Many Turks felt
sympathy for the Palestinians and opposed what they saw as an overtly
pro-Israeli US stance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Nonetheless,
this did not seriously affect the formation of Turkish regional strategy
and policymaking. Stra egic alliance and cooperation between the United
States and Turkey meant that Turkey would support US strategic
priorities in the Middle East, even when this came to the point of
forging a strategic alliance with Israel and thus alienating the Arab
states and Iran. This equilibrium was disturbed by what followed the
terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The relapse of violence in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the rise of the Jus tice and Development
Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, AKP) to power in 2002, and the US
invasion of Iraq in 20039 brought this alliance under considerable
pressure. As the interests of US foreign policy shifted towards the
Middle East, it became increasingly clear that the strategic and
tactical aims of both states could diverge in some of the region\'s
conflicts. [The situation became further complicated]{.underline} with
the [occupation of Iraq by the United States]{.underline} and its
allies. The expansion of the Kurdish-controlled zone in northern Iraq
and the [subsequent creation of a Kurdish federal entity]{.underline}
there facilitated the re-emergence of the PKK as a significant security
threat for Turkey. A milestone in the deterioration of US-Turkey
relations was the refusal of the Turkish Parliament on March 1, 2003 to
allow US troops the use of Turkish territory in preparation for their
invasion of Iraq.10 As the United States was preparing an invasion of
Iraq in early 2003, it became clear that the chances of a swift victory
over Saddam Husayn\'s armed forces would drastically increase if a
second front was opened on the Turkish-Iraqi border. This led to a
formal US request for the deployment of US military forces within
Turkish territory. Many in Turkey felt that the country would have to
pay the price of US adventurism in the Middle East for a second time ?
the first being in 1991. [While Turkish public opinion was firmly
against the US invasion of Iraq,]{.underline}11 [the AKP
government,]{.underline} led by Abdullah Giil, [decided to support the
US request]{.underline}, trying to trade agreement for a generous US
military and monetary aid package. As time was pressing, a major
logistics operation was already on its way when the Turkish Parliament
voted on March 1,2003 on a bill permitting the use of Turkish territory
by US troops. Despite the wide parliamentary majority which the AKP
enjoyed in the Parliament, the bill failed to collect the necessary
majority of votes and was thus rejected. About 90 AKP delegates took
advantage of the secret character of the vote to express their
opposition to the bill and US policies in the region in general. They
apparently included in their ranks delegates as high-ranking as the
Speaker of Parliament Biilent Anng and Deputy Prime Minister Ertugrul
Yalgmbayir.12 The blow against US war planning and prestige was heavy.
The US troops ready to de ploy on Turkish territory had to abandon their
operations after weeks of preparations, and the planning of the US
invasion of Iraq was upset. The war followed suit without a second front
in the north. It was only due to the unexpectedly weak resistance of
Iraqi troops and the relatively easy victory of US forces on the
battlegrounds of southern Iraq that the issue received less attention.
This refusal of the Turkish Parliament has been considered a case where
[anti-Americanism]{.underline} **[produced tangible effects which harmed
US interests.]{.underline}** While Keohane and Katzenstein argue that
anti-Americanism has failed to pro duce strong global effects on US
diplomacy, they add that the March 1, 2003 vote showed how
anti-Americanism can be consequential in specific conjunctures.13 Such a
change of Turkish policy could not go unattended in the United States.
In fact, it alienated Turkey from many of its longstanding allies within
US policymaking circles. Prominent Neoconservative figures and think
tanks which had traditionally supported Turkish positions and
constituted a key part of the US Turkish lobby felt betrayed and exposed
by Turkey\'s decision.14 What made the situation even harder to accept
was that opposition to the US campaign did not emanate solely from the
AKP government, but also from the Turkish military and bureaucratic
elites, old and trusted partners of the United States. While the AKP
government had formally endorsed the bill, the military failed to take
an open position in favor of US operations. At the critical meet ing of
the National Security Council (Milli G?venlik Kurulu, MGK), on February
28, 2003, just a few days before the March 1, 2003 voting, no clear
support for the US request was expressed. In the words of the then-US
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz: \[M\]any of the institutions
in Turkey that we think of as the traditional strong sup ort \... were
not as forceful in leading in that direction. \... particularly the
military. I think for whatever reason they did not play the strong
leadership role on that issue that we would have expected.15 Turkey\'s
refusal to join the US \"coalition of the willing\" had a major
consequence. The absence of Turkish troops meant that the leverage
Turkey had to influence devel opments in post-war Iraq was limited. In
contrast, Iraqi Kurds gained increasing sig nificance due to their role
as the most stable and trustworthy ally of the United States in Iraq. In
addition, the proclamation of the new Iraqi Constitution turned the
country into a federal state with a predominantly Kurdish Kurdistan
Regional Government (KRG) in the north. The growing relative
significance of the Iraqi Kurds as key regional allies of the United
States also meant that US-Turkey interests found a new point of
contention. While Turkey initially had opposed any plans for Kurdish
autonomy in Iraq, it later moderated its stance to conform with post-war
reality. On the one hand, it accepted the prospect of a federal system,
while stressing its full opposition to any partition plan. On the other
hand, it included support for Turcomans in its Iraq agenda.16 By
assuming the role of the guard ian of Iraq\'s Turcoman minority, Ankara
hoped to gain additional leverage in domestic Iraqi politics. This
became evident when Turkey openly took sides in the domestic Iraqi
dispute over the future status of the city of Kirkuk. However, playing
the Turcoman card yielded little to Turkish foreign policy, as many of
the Turcomans ? particularly those who were Shi\'ites ? remained
indifferent to Turkish sponsorship. Ankara\'s involvement in Kirkuk
became an additional thorn in US-Turkey talks over Iraq.17 The Kirkuk
province, in which the second biggest oilfield in the world is located,
was claimed by the Iraqi Kurds who pointed at Saddam\'s intensive and
violent efforts to alter the demographic balance of the city in favor of
Sunni Arabs. In the aftermath of the 2003 war, Kurds started
repopulating it, allegedly in an effort to restore the previous
demographic balance.18 Consequently they claimed it for the Iraqi
Kurdistan Regional Government. Controlling oil-rich Kirkuk was thought
to be a crucial lifeline for the Kurdish federal entity, and potentially
could financially support an independent Kurdish state. Turkey
vehemently objected to these plans, fearing that such a development
would destabilize Turkey\'s Kurdish-inhabited southeastern and eastern
provinces. Instead, it championed the rights of Kirkuk\'s sizable
Turcoman minority. While the future status of Kirkuk was set to be
decided by a referendum, Turkey objected to any measure which could lead
to the incorporation of Kirkuk into the KRG. An event whose details
still remain unclear triggered a major crisis in US-Turkey relations and
further fueled anti-Americanism. On July 4, 2003, US soldiers arrested
11 Turkish special forces officers in the northern Iraqi city of
Sulaymaniya, who were suspected of planning the assassination of a local
Kurdish politician.19 The arrested Turkish officers were hooded and led
away from their headquarters for questioning. When this news became
public, the media and popular reaction was unprecedented. Such treatment
was deemed disgraceful and a national insult coming from a traditional
ally.20 The fact that the victim of the insult was the Turkish army made
things even worse for US-Turkey relations. The military has
traditionally enjoyed high popularity and esteem in Turkish public
opinion, and it also was among the most pro-US actors in Turkish
domestic politics. The Sulaymaniya incident alienated even some of the
most loyal supporters of the US-Turkish strategic alliance. It was added
to claims that the United States was considering partition plans of Iraq
and the establishment of a fully independent Kurdish state in the north
of the country, or even a large-scale redrawing of the map of the Middle
East which would entail territorial losses for Turkey. These [added fuel
to existing nationalist conspiracy theories]{.underline} and **[further
aroused anti-US feel ings in Turkey]{.underline}**, which for the first
time [appeared significantly among secularist elites.]{.underline} This
shift was clearly documented in opinion surveys.21 According to the 2006
Pew Global Attitudes Survey, the number of Turks who had a favorable
view of the United States fell from 32% in 2004 to 23% in 2005 and to a
mere 17% in 2006. The corresponding numbers were 27% in Pakistan, 36% in
Indonesia and Egypt, and 38% in Jordan.22 Support for the US-led War on
Terror fell from 37% in 2004 to 17% in 2005, and 14% in 2006.23 At 3%,
Turkey recorded the lowest level of confidence in President George W.
Bush among the 15 countries of the survey.24 In 2007, the results of the
same survey were even more telling. The [number of Turks who had a
favorable view of the United States]{.underline} fell to a tiny 9%, the
[lowest among all states]{.underline} and **[considerably less than even
the Palestinians]{.underline}**, of whom 13% expressed a favorable view
of the United States.25 [Eighty-one percent of Turks expressed their dis
like of US ideas about democrac]{.underline}y, while [83% expressed
their opposition **to US \"ways of doing business\" in international
affairs**]{.underline}.26 Twenty-two percent expressed positive views of
US movies, music, and television, 37% for US science and technology, but
[only]{.underline} **[4% for the spread of US ideas.27]{.underline}**
The situation slightly improved in the following years. The election of
Barack Obama to the US presidency was a primary reason for that. As in
most countries, Turkish public opinion favored Obama, who was seen as a
harbinger of change in US foreign policy, particularly in the Middle
East. His decision to visit Ankara in early April 2009 made Turkey the
first Muslim country that he visited. This was well received in Turkey.
In his address to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Obama took the
opportunity to send a message to the Muslim world. He argued that The
United States is not and will never be at war with Islam. In fact, our
partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling back
the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject but also to
strengthen opportunity for its people. \... America\'s relationship with
the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot be based just on the
opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual
interest and mutual respect.28 Nonetheless, the visit proved to be of
little avail regarding the restoration of the US image in Turkey.
According to the 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Survey, the number of Turks
with a favorable view of the United States rose to 14% in 2009 --- up
from 12% in 2008.29 These were still the worst ratings for the United
States among all sur veyed countries. According to the same survey, 40%
of Turks saw the United States as an enemy while only 18% saw it as a
friend.30 **[Mistrust of US foreign policy remained
strong]{.underline}**. Only 19% of Turks expressed the view that Obama
would be fair in the Middle East, while 52% argued the opposite.31
Although 33% of Turks expressed confidence in President Obama ? compared
to only 2% for President Bush in 2008 ? 52% showed little or no
confidence in Obama.32 These [findings seem to confirm]{.underline} that
**[anti-American ism in Turkey is not ephemeral, but tends to establish
its position]{.underline}**33 [and is becoming]{.underline} **[an
important component of contemporary Turkish nationalism.]{.underline}**
ANTI-AMERICANISM IN MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE The rise of
anti-Americanism in Turkish society also can be documented in the media
and popular culture. Beyond the legitimate reaction to US wrongdoings in
Iraq, [wide publicity was given to unfounded claims or conspiracy
theories regarding the US role in the Middle East]{.underline} and the
actions of US troops in the region. The Abu Ghraib prison scandal of
2003 was presented as evidence of the evil character of the US
occupation and of the United States itself. Accusations that US soldiers
were harvesting organs from Iraqi prisoners and insurgents and selling
them abroad found a following in Turkey.34 Scathing attacks against the
United States during the bloody operations for the recapture of the city
of Fallujah in November 2004 were followed by the publication of
official statements in which US operations were called genocide and
compared to the Holocaust.35 The alleged role of Israel in post-war Iraq
also stirred the ire of the Turkish press. Widespread claims appeared
that Israel was actively involved in northern Iraq36 to support Iraqi
Kurds and the creation of a Kurdish state as an Israeli client between
Turkey, Iran, and the Arab world. This often resulted in the coupling of
anti-American and anti-Semitic feelings in parts of Turkish society.
These attacks were not only limited to the Islamist media. **[Anti
Americanism was crossing political and ideological
lines]{.underline}**.37 In the field of popular culture, [books and
films in which Turkey came into direct --- and successful --- military
confrontation with the United States]{.underline} [met with unprece
dented commercial success.]{.underline}38 The fictional book Metal Storm
(Metal Firtina), narrated a war between Turkey and the United States in
the near future.39 According to the plot, the United States invades
Turkey from Iraq. Operation \"Metal Storm\" results in the occupation of
Turkey\'s large cities. In a second phase, Operation \"Sevres,\"40
Turkey\'s archenemies --- Greece, Armenia, and the Kurds --- plan the
partition of the country. The Turks then forge a global anti-US alliance
with China, Russia, and Germany, while a Turkish agent detonates a
nuclear device in Washington, DC. This brings the occupation to an end,
and Turkey triumphs.41 The book, which ran to ten editions and sold
about 500,000 copies in the first 18 months of its publication in late
2004, was a prominent example of a best-selling book characterized by
rampant anti-Americanism. The authors skillfully capitalized on emerging
anti-American feelings and existing phobias in Turkish society. They
created a nationalist epic, in which Turkey defeats new --- the United
States --- and the Kurds --- and old enemies --- Armenia and Greece --
to trium phantly reclaim its independence. The commercial success of the
book led to the pub lication of a sequel, which also was well-received
by the public.42 The [commercial success of a movie based on a popular
TV series]{.underline} was [an addi tional manifestation of rising
anti-Americanism in Turkey]{.underline}. The Valley of Wolves: Iraq
(Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak) was, at the time of its release, the most
expensive production in the history of Turkish cinema and eventually
became its biggest commercial success as well. It featured the
adventures of Polat Alemdar, a Turkish intelligence agent who operates
in Iraq, defending justice, restoring Turkish honor, and avenging
American atrocities in Iraq. The movie combines nationalist,
Orientalist, and Occidentalist stereo types.43 Alongside anti-American
and anti-Semitic tones, the movie depicts the Iraqis as backward,
cowardly, overtly religious, and clearly inferior to Turks. The only
groups that enjoy a positive portrayal are the Turcomans, Turkey\'s
alleged ethnic brethren in Iraq, and those Kurds who collaborated with
Turks. Positive critiques of the film were found not only in the
nationalist media but also came from high-ranking ministers and MPs.44
The spectacular commercial success and popular appeal of a book and a
movie replete with nationalistic and [anti-American messages **comprised
a clear signal of the growing popular anti-American nationalism in
Turkey.**]{.underline}

A transactional relationship is increasingly seen as the only solution
for the future of U.S.-Turkey relations. As the relationship has lost
its values-based spirit and diplomatic crises have exhausted both sides,
a business-like understanding has emerged as a last attempt to keep the
relationship alive. Yet, as even transactional relations have
significant shortcomings, [Washington and Ankara]{.underline} **[should
be prepared for a messy divorce.]{.underline}**

The [last decade]{.underline} has **[seen an unprecedented
decline]{.underline}** i[n U.S.-Turkey relations]{.underline}, going
from a model of strategic partnership to the level of "so-called
allies." [America's partnership]{.underline} with the Kurdish People\'s
Protection Units ([YPG]{.underline}) in northern Syria[, Turkey's
relations with radical groups]{.underline} and its [purchase of Russian
S-400 air defense systems, a]{.underline}nd [democratic
backsliding]{.underline} in Turkey are [only some of the issues that
have harmed the relationship.]{.underline}

On top of that, **[deep anti-American and anti-Western
sentiments]{.underline}** [that cut across]{.underline} **[different
political cleavages]{.underline}** [in Turkish politic]{.underline}s,
revisionism in Turkish foreign policy, and President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan's **opportunist understanding of diplomacy**]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} not only **[undermined both sides'
trust]{.underline}** but also the perception of shared values.

Given this grim picture, a transactional relationship comes forward as
the only viable option to manage the issues that still necessitate
cooperation on both sides. As Washington aims to allocate its resources
to great power competition and broaden its alliances, reaching an
understanding with Turkey, albeit on a limited basis, has a number of
advantages. Moreover, Erdogan's short-sighted opportunism seems quite
suitable for such an interest-based understanding. Yet, the
characteristics of U.S.-Turkey relations and their bilateral
expectations complicate a transactional turn in relations. Instead of a
business-like exchange of interests, policymakers in Washington must be
ready to put up a stiff fight for every bit of America's interests
vis-a-vis Ankara.

Transactional relations have mostly been associated with populist
authoritarians like former President Donald Trump and Erdogan. Instead
of pursuing long-term grand strategies with defined goals and
principles, these leaders prefer give-and-take relationships primarily
based on short-term economic interests, rendering values, shared goals,
or bilateral commitments no longer relevant. In this respect, Turkey's
relationship with Europe is a typical example of such a transactional
relationship. Although values and principles played a key role when
European Union (EU) membership was a serious goal for Ankara, Turkey-EU
ties have evolved into an interest-based relationship in which the sides
respect each other's red lines. Ankara's systematic human rights
violations and Erdogan's authoritarianism still draw criticism from the
European leaders, but Turkey-EU trade, European investments in Turkey,
the Turkish diaspora in Europe, geographic proximity, and cooperation on
stopping the flow of refugees keep the relations working. In this
respect, the economic and social characteristics of the relationship
have helped the sides reach an understanding, while the most significant
challenge has been a geopolitical conflict in the eastern Mediterranean.

However, U.S.-Turkey relations have different dynamics. First, they rely
more on geopolitical calculations and less on economic interests, which
makes a trade-off much more difficult, if not impossible. The
disagreements over Syria policy, the U.S.-YPG partnership, Turkey's
military operations against the Kurds, and Erdogan's flirtation with
Putin are mostly about core national interests, security perceptions,
and grand political strategies. If Turkey maintains its aggressive
interventionism and the United States stays in the region, these
conflicts will further increase and make bargaining more complicated.
Besides, as the problems between Washington and Ankara have increased
both quantitatively and qualitatively, a transactional relationship has
become more complicated. Although economic sanctions might bring great
harm to the weak Turkish economy, they are unlikely to ensure a change
in Turkey's strategic orientation.

The geopolitical and strategic character of U.S.-Turkey relations also
complicates the compartmentalization of the relationship. The issues
that are more convenient for making trade-offs---Halkbank's involvement
in Iranian sanctions evasion, S-400 and F-16 fighter jet deals, and the
incarceration of U.S. citizens in Turkey---are mostly extensions of
broader strategic conflicts. The sides consider all these issues to be
in the same basket, which makes them all interconnected and thus more
difficult to solve. As recently seen, Ankara has brought up the issue of
the Kurdistan Workers' Party and Gulenists as Sweden and Finland pursue
NATO membership.

[Another difficulty for]{.underline} a transactional [relationship is
both sides' **expectations of each other**]{.underline}. Despite the
difficulties in relations, [neither Washington nor Ankara seem ready for
a spli]{.underline}t. The [Biden]{.underline} administration [still
expects Turkey to turn away from Russia and return to NATO.]{.underline}
"We have an interest in trying to keep Turkey anchored to the West,"
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last year. Indeed, the war in
Ukraine has shown that a Turkish "charm offensive" can still be very
influential in improving Ankara's image and turning the tide of its
relations with the United States.

In return, [Ankara expects its strategic **autonomy, regional influence,
and global role** to be recognized]{.underline} and accepted by the
United States. Yet, [Ankara still cannot digest America "working around"
Turkey's geopolitical importance]{.underline} by substituting Incirlik
Airbase with Greece or partnering with the Kurds in northern Syria. So
long as these strategic expectations dominate the nature of U.S.-Turkey
relations, it will continue to be difficult to establish a transactional
understanding.

Moreover, [Erdogan's hot-tempered and **undiplomatic
character**]{.underline} [is a constant threat that can blow up a
business-like exchange of interests]{.underline}. Statecraft is useful
for establishing an understanding, particularly when values and
strategic interests do not align. Yet, [acts like]{.underline}
**[beating U.S. citizens]{.underline}** [during an official
visit]{.underline} to Washington or insulting counterparts as "Nazi
remnants and fascists" [might increase the **challenge of reaching a
diplomatic tradeoff.**]{.underline}

On the other hand, transactional relations are not a completely new
phenomenon within the context of U.S.-Turkey relations. The relationship
has always had a strong transactional character, particularly after the
Cold War. Conflicting values and ideals have never been a serious
obstacle between Washington and Ankara. As Cihan Tugal eloquently
argued, the United States and other NATO countries have long been
accustomed to turning a blind eye to Turkey's authoritarianism and human
rights violations, particularly against the Kurds. Besides,
communication channels have always been open in order to keep relations
and negotiations functioning. However, despite all that, the
relationship has remained dysfunctional for the last few years.

U.S.-Turkey [relations are more like an **endless, messy
divorce**]{.underline} [in which even **trivial matters can cause
fights**]{.underline}. But at the same time[, it is not possible for
Washington and Ankara **to go completely separate ways
either**]{.underline}. As the Ukraine crisis has shown once again[,
Turkey is not a country to be discarded]{.underline}. Turkey will
[continue to be an attractive option for balancing Russian and Iranian
influence]{.underline} in the region. Moreover, [thanks to Ankara's
foreign policy activism]{.underline}, **[Erdogan will do much to draw
international attention.]{.underline}** Instead, U.S. policymakers must
be ready to fight for their interests vis-à-vis Ankara.

#### Erdogan is [not cooperating now]{.underline}---Finland and Sweden proves---throw-out old evidence this is a [new start]{.underline}

The big suspicion that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan **is
playing hardball** in refusing to accept the Nato applications of
Finland and Sweden]{.underline} **[because he needs to reassert his
nationalist credentials]{.underline}** [ahead of his country's national
elections]{.underline} is not something Western diplomats are likely to
point to as things stand, with difficult negotiations aimed at getting
Ankara on board at a delicate stage. However, that explanation for
Erdogan's intransigence looked even more like the right explanation by
the end of June 15, a day in which [Turkey]{.underline} **[rejected
invitations by Nato to participate in trilateral talks with Finland and
Sweden.]{.underline}**

If set up, the [talks would be aimed at finding a solution to Turkey's
threat to veto]{.underline} the Nordic countries' applications to join
the Western military alliance, which are supported by all other Nato
countries**[. But Erdogan's domestic woes are immense]{.underline}**.
The [president of nearly three decades is accused by many Turks mired in
their country's excruciating economic crisis o]{.underline}f having
mismanaged the economy. [His]{.underline} **[opinion poll ratings are
dire]{.underline}** [and his bid for re-election must take place by June
next year at the latest]{.underline}. Erdogan is likely to do far more
muscle-flexing on the Nato expansion issue before giving ground, while
-- as the authoritarian cranks up the hard power politics he perceives
as attractive to his core voters -- a Turkish invasion of northern Syria
in pursuit of Kurdish militants remains on the cards and Ankara's war of
words with Greece over certain Aegean islands could grow ever more
alarming.

#### US-Turkey cooperation is [low]{.underline} but [malleable]{.underline}

On October 31, US President Joe Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan met on the margins of the G20 gathering in Rome, ending weeks of
speculation about whether such a summit would take place. Earlier that
month, a [short-lived diplomatic crisis]{.underline} had **[demonstrated
just how strained ties between the two countries are.]{.underline}**

The US ambassador to Ankara David Satterfield and [nine other Western
envoys had **been threatened with expulsion**]{.underline}
[after]{.underline} they called for the release of jailed Turkish
philanthropist Osman Kavala -- an act the Turkish government perceived
as **[meddling in its internal affairs.]{.underline}**

Biden and Erdogan's meeting -- their second this year -- indicated that
[lines of communication are still open]{.underline}. **[But it cannot be
denied that Turkish-American relations are at an all-time
low.]{.underline}**

From the Turkish side, the perception that the US is an unreliable ally
and is in fact seeking to undermine [Ankara has been]{.underline}
growing and **[feeding anti-Americanism]{.underline}** over the past
five to six years. Washington's decision in 2015 to arm Kurdish forces
in Syria affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which
Ankara -- and its Western allies -- consider a "terrorist" organisation,
and allegations of US involvement in the attempted coup against
Erdogan's government in 2016 have all fuelled this sentiment.

[From]{.underline} the [US perspective]{.underline}, **[Turkey's
decision to foster closer ties with Russia]{.underline}** has [caused
concern]{.underline}. The Turkish purchase of Russian-made S-400 defence
systems in 2017 [sent]{.underline} **[shockwaves through
Washington]{.underline}**, which has been wary of Russia's resurgence.

The [delivery of the advanced weapons]{.underline} to Ankara in 2019
**[triggered sanctions]{.underline}** against Turkish officials under
the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) a
year later. More importantly, it [resulted]{.underline} **[in Turkey's
expulsion from the international consortium]{.underline}** behind the
development of a new generation of fighter jets, the F-35. Erdogan's
recent statements that the Turkish government is looking to buy another
batch of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems further incensed
Washington.

So with all this tension between them, [are Turkey and the US on the
cusp of a breakup]{.underline}? **[Probably not]{.underline}**. [Neither
Biden nor Erdogan]{.underline} is **[pushing for a complete
decoupling]{.underline}**. Indeed, the Turkish government is hoping to
clinch a deal with the Biden administration for the purchase of 40 F-16
fighter jets and 80 modernisation kits to upgrade older military
aircraft. Turkey is keen to bring up-to-date its air force which is
largely composed of F-16s. It is also keen to recoup the \$1.4bn advance
payment it made for the F-35 project.

#### Cooperation is low now---Biden won't even visit

Asked on May 18 how he would convince Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan to agree to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, US President Joe
[Biden]{.underline} said, \"I'm **[not going to Turkey]{.underline}**,
but I think we're going to be OK.\"

[Nine days later]{.underline}, **[all is not yet OK]{.underline}**.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on May 27 that
"[an]{.underline} [approach of]{.underline} 'we'll convince Turkey in
time anyway, **[we are friends and allies' would not be
correct,\"]{.underline}** and that Sweden and Finland \"need to take
concrete steps."

The [Biden administration's position that]{.underline} \"**[this is not
a US issue]{.underline}**,\" meaning it can be worked out among Sweden,
Finland and Turkey, may require a rethink. Direct negotiations this week
in Ankara ended without resolution. Erdogan is dug in that the two
Nordic countries must take \"concrete steps\" to crack down on the
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Turkey, as well as the United
States, consider a terrorist organization.

#### Biden is giving Erdogan the [cold shoulder]{.underline}

[With just seven days until]{.underline} Joe [Biden assumes office,
the]{.underline} US **[president]{.underline}**-**[elect is yet to
respond to]{.underline}** Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdogan\'s
offer of a phone call]{.underline}**, [an **unusual snub**]{.underline}
[for a powerful Nato ally]{.underline}.

Three people familiar with the issue told Middle East Eye that
[Erdogan\'s office requested a call with Biden last month**, but weeks
later no conversation has been arranged.**]{.underline}

[Biden's decision not to pick up the phone]{.underline} is [hardly
surprising considering his remarks]{.underline} last year [to the New
York Times,]{.underline} in which he said that [Washington should take a
**different approach towards Erdogan and support the Turkish
opposition**]{.underline}.

[Erdogan also wasn't particularly quick to congratulate
Biden]{.underline} on his 3 November election victory, as Ankara [was
mindful of its warm relations with the Trump
administration]{.underline}. The Turkish president was one the last
world leaders to do so, in a message sent in November.

Both Biden's transition team and the Turkish presidency have avoided
giving MEE direct answers to queries on the issue.

A spokesperson for Biden said that his team would continue to read out
any congratulatory calls the president-elect takes part in. "Beyond that
we'll decline to comment," the spokesperson said.

Likewise, a spokesperson for the Turkish presidency said his office
would release a readout if Erdogan had a phone call with Biden.

Beyond the phone call issue, Turkish officials in Ankara have publicly
said that they are willing to establish a constructive relationship with
the new administration.

Ibrahim Kalin, the chief adviser and the spokesperson for Erdogan, told
Turkish TV on Sunday that Ankara's contacts with the transition team so
far were "very positive".

"They say they want to develop good relations with Turkey and turn a new
page," Kalin added.

However, [reluctance to talk to Erdogan**, while calling up all the
leaders of major allies,**]{.underline} from South Korea to Australia to
New Zealand, [suggests Biden **won\'t be quick to turn a page with the
Turkish government.**]{.underline}

"Everyone understands the importance of Turkey for this part of the
world, and the Biden administration, too, will seek to have a
problem-free relationship with Ankara," Asli Aydintasbas, a senior
policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told
MEE. "But [there are]{.underline} **[outstanding issues and a toxic
narrative in bilateral ties."]{.underline}**

Aydintasbas said [the new administration's first instinct will
be]{.underline} **[to have a little distance in the
relationship]{.underline}**: "Neither uphold Turkey as a model for the
region nor target Turkey as a geopolitical troublemaker. Just
**[neutrality and distance."]{.underline}**

Biden and Erdogan's personal history goes back to 2011, when the
then-vice president paid a visit to Erdogan in his personal residence
after he had undergone surgery.

On many occasions during the Obama presidency, Biden played the role of
interlocutor, channelling Erdogan's frustrations to the administration
over the years, and their friendship got closer.

In 2014, Biden blamed Turkey and the UAE for strengthening the Islamic
State group through their policies, particularly highlighting Ankara's
failure to seal the border to prevent the flow of foreign fighters in
Syria. An angry Erdogan said in response that Biden should apologise or
he would become "history to him". And the vice president followed
through.

Then in 2016, after the coup attempt in Ankara, Biden visited Erdogan
and publicly apologised for not making a trip sooner and showing support
for the Turkish government.

But [Biden\'s warm and conciliatory sentiments **began to change out of
office**]{.underline}, particularly when Turkey staged an offensive in
October 2019 against US-backed Kurds in Syria.

"[Turkey is the real problem here]{.underline}," Biden said at the time,
during a televised Democratic Party debate. "[And I would be having a
real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he\'s
going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that
price."]{.underline}

### UQ --- AT: Low Polls

[There may be **political motivations**]{.underline} [behind the
move]{.underline} [as Turks return to the polls next June]{.underline}
**[amid a biting economic crisis.]{.underline}**

This is \"another [strategy deployed]{.underline} by the Turkish
government [to reach out to the]{.underline} **[nationalist voters in a
crucial year for Turkish politics,\"]{.underline}** said Francesco
Siccardi, senior program manager at the Carnegie Europe think tank.

The **[timing]{.underline}** of the name change [is \"crucial\" to next
year\'s elections]{.underline}, he said. \"The [decision]{.underline} on
the name change [was announced last]{.underline} December,
[when]{.underline} President [Erdogan **was trailing in all opinion
polls**]{.underline} and the country was navigating one of the worst
economic crises of the last 20 years.\"

Erdogan\'s [position in the polls has dropped significantly over the
year]{.underline}s. Polls from late last year [show support for the
ruling AK party at around 31-33%]{.underline} according to Reuters, down
from 42.6% during the 2018 parliamentary elections.

Ulgen however said the name change was more of a rebranding strategy to
boost the country\'s international standing rather than a pre-election
stunt.

Turkey\'s foreign trade deficit climbed 98.5% year-on-year to \$6.11
billion in April, Reuters reported, citing the Turkish Statistical
Institute. Annual inflation jumped to 73.5% last month, a 22-year high.

Analysts say that at times of crisis, [the president tends to resort
to]{.underline} **[populist moves]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[deflect attention from problems at home.]{.underline}** [The economic
turmoil,]{.underline} having already brought people into the streets,
[has been a headache for the government.]{.underline}

\"The new name will both [distract]{.underline} **[the domestic audience
from more concrete, pressing problems]{.underline}** [and offer
President Erdogan another argument for his case for a]{.underline}
**[stronger, more traditional Turkey]{.underline}**,\" said Siccardi.

In another populist move in 2020, Erdogan issued a decree to convert
Istanbul\'s historic Byzantine Hagia Sofia Museum into a mosque.

\"In the absence of concrete policies to handle the country\'s economic
and political problems, [Erdogan seeks salvation in **populist identity
politics**]{.underline},\" Political analyst Seren Korkmaz wrote of the
move at the time. \"**[He boosts Turkish nationalism]{.underline}** and
Islamism **[and targets opposition figures.\"]{.underline}**

Indeed, President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan delivered]{.underline} **[a
strong message at a public ceremony]{.underline}** in Van
[regarding]{.underline} the **[Kurdish community's rights and his stance
during the resolution process]{.underline}**: "For me, [there is
absolutely no difference between my Kurdish brothers and sisters and my
Turkish brothers and sisters]{.underline}. For we love the created due
to the creator. **[We cannot engage in discrimination]{.underline}**. We
haven't discriminated in the past. We are not discriminating today.
**[Nor will we discriminate in the future]{.underline}**. Whereas some
people hid behind terrorist groups and exploited democracy, [we fought
to grant you the rights and liberties that you deserved without
question]{.underline}. Wherever you see those, who exploit your identity
when they open their mouth, grab them by the collar and ask them: Who
asked you to re-embrace the guns and end the resolution process?"

On the second level of the identity debate -- the national identity --
we will witness intense discussions.

The [government and the opposition will engage in a]{.underline}
**[fierce rhetorical competition over how to treat questions of foreign
policy]{.underline}** [and security vis-à-vis Turkey's national
interests/identity.]{.underline}

The [decision to block Sweden and Finland's NATO membership, Greece's
militarization of the Aegean islands, military operations against
PKK-YPG]{.underline} in Syria and Iraq, and **[dialogue with the Western
governments over those issues immediately come to mind.]{.underline}**
Again, [an important issue will be which definition of '**national
interest' and 'national identity'**]{.underline} would best prepare
Turkey for its next century.

At a time when great power competition leads to war -- in Ukraine, which
is just the beginning -- and emboldened nationalism fuels fresh
uncertainty in the international system, the discourse of "defending
national interests" cannot be treated as a simple discourse of national
survival.

[Politicians must refrain from]{.underline} **[alienating any groups in
Turkey]{.underline}** [while engaging in a rhetorical competition over
"defending the national identity and interests."]{.underline} The
political [parties and candidates]{.underline}, **[which discriminate
against the various identities that collectively form
Turkey,]{.underline}** [cannot possibly make the electorate accept their
definition of national interest.]{.underline}

[Turkey's allies]{.underline} and rivals, along with Turks themselves,
[might want to buckle up for **12 months of turbulence.**]{.underline}
[The US and Europe should brace **themselves for even more mudslinging
and contrariness**]{.underline} [from Erdogan]{.underline} at a time
**[when they need his cooperation]{.underline}** in containing Russian
adventurism.

Ornery in the best of times[, Erdogan has grown]{.underline} **[even
more quarrelsome with the West]{.underline}** [as he has
become]{.underline} **[politically vulnerable at home.]{.underline}**
His fortunes are now at their lowest ebb since he first took the reins
in Ankara in 2003. [He and his party have slipped in opinion
polls]{.underline} over the past couple of years[, as Turkey's economy
has been hammered by]{.underline} a combination of [the
pandemic]{.underline} and the president's economic policies.

[Although]{.underline} the lira has tanked and [inflation has soared,
Erdogan has stubbornly resisted calls to raise interest
rate]{.underline}s. "Turkey is again stuck in a vicious cycle. High
inflation causes the lira to weaken, which results in even higher
inflation" said Ziad Daoud, chief emerging markets economist at
Bloomberg Economics. "Lifting interest rates would break this cycle, but
that's unlikely to happen."

[With little prospect of an economic turnaround]{.underline} in time for
the vote[, the president must]{.underline} **[find other ways to make
his case for re-election]{.underline}**. All the early signs are that
[he will dip into the **old populist's playbook**]{.underline},
appealing [to ethno-nationalism at home and **raising alarms about
foreign enemies**]{.underline} --- real and imagined.

Some **[of his favorite bogeymen are now out of]{.underline}**
**[bounds]{.underline}**: Turkey's economic troubles have forced
[Erdogan]{.underline} to **[make nice with the Gulf Arab
states]{.underline}** [he used to pillory,]{.underline} to popular
acclaim. He [can't very well portray the ruling families of Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [United Arab Emirates as
perfidious reactionaries]{.underline} **[while pleading with them
for]{.underline}** investment and trade **[deals]{.underline}**.

[Erdogan]{.underline} has also **[softened his rhetoric against
Israel]{.underline}**, thanks in no small part to a friendship he has
struck with President Isaac Herzog.

[This leaves him with one familiar fall guy:]{.underline} **[the
West]{.underline}**. [He has already begun to]{.underline} **[ratchet up
his rhetoric against the US and Europe.]{.underline}** In a carefully
choreographed meeting with young Turks last week, [he denounced the West
as **mendacious and untrustworthy**]{.underline}. He has lashed out at
another old bugbear, demanding that Greece demilitarize islands in the
Aegean Sea, adding that he was "not joking."

In the months ahead, [expect Erdogan to **build on the general themes of
Western duplicitousness**]{.underline} and to double down on his
conspiracy theory that Turkey's woes are the result of a deliberate
campaign by "global barons of politics and money." [Turks]{.underline}
groaning under the twin burdens of inflation and currency depreciation
[will be encouraged **to blame the US**]{.underline} and the Europe
**[rather than their president.]{.underline}**

In addition to using progressively more astringent rhetoric, [the
president will be **less cooperative in his dealings with the
West**]{.underline}. We're already seeing this in his refusal to budge
on NATO expansion: [By framing his objection]{.underline} to Sweden and
Finland as a matter of national security (he accuses them of harboring
Kurdish terrorists) [Erdogan is **exaggerating the threat**]{.underline}
as well as [portraying his recalcitrance as **patriotic
resistance**]{.underline} in the face of foreign bullying.

[There is no point in **expecting reasonableness from any
politician**]{.underline} [who has their]{.underline} **[back to the
wall,]{.underline}** and certainly not from one who has decided
intransigence is in his best interest. As frustrating as it will be for
President Biden and European leaders, they should recognize where
Erdogan is coming from, and act accordingly. Threats won't work since
they will only play into his narrative of heroic defiance.

[Their best bet might be to signal to him that if Turkey won't join the
consensus]{.underline}, **[they will devise workarounds]{.underline}**.
This may require the NATO powers to build a separate security
architecture for Sweden and Finland outside the alliance --- at least
until next summer, when they will either be dealing with a new Turkish
president or with a victorious [**Erdogan**]{.underline} who no longer
**[needs them as bogeymen.]{.underline}**

Turks often expose degrees of confusion when asked about their foreign
policy preferences. A [public opinion poll]{.underline} in the mid-2000s
**[found that most Turks viewed the US as a threat to world
security]{.underline}** -- but the same poll found that Turks expected
the US, before every other ally, to come to Turkey's help if needed.

[Conspiracy theories]{.underline} have **[always been
abundant]{.underline}** in the Turkish psyche. Schoolchildren grow up
hearing maxims like "A Turk's only friend is another Turk" and "Our
Ottoman ancestors had to fight seven worlds (the big powers)." According
to this worldview, the [world's major powers construct intricate
conspiracies as they tirelessly plot to stop Turkey's rise.]{.underline}

In an age of rising populism, Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdoğan]{.underline} has **[systematically fueled the common
thinking]{.underline}** [that "the entire world is conspiring against
us]{.underline}." [His]{.underline} Islamist,
**[anti-western,]{.underline}** isolationist [narrative]{.underline} is
creat[ing a vicious circle that threatens to take]{.underline} Turkey's
**[foreign policy]{.underline}** calculus **[hostage]{.underline}** --
not only today, but well into the future.

Until Erdoğan came to power in November 2002, most Turks would not have
known or even been interested in the names of their foreign ministers.
In the 1990s, I saw a group of party supporters clamor to kick the then
foreign minister out of a party meeting, mistaking him for a journalist.

[Erdoğan's ambitious neo-Ottoman ideology **introduced foreign policy
into Turks' daily lives.**]{.underline} [Coffeehouse talk changed
from]{.underline} standard ruminations on inflation, joblessness,
**[economic]{.underline}** hardships, and football **[to]{.underline}**
pontifications about the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Arab Spring, the
Syrian civil war, **[America]{.underline}**, the EU, and Russia.

Two different surveys in 2011, conducted just after Erdoğan's party had
won 49.5% of the national vote in a general election, found the
following:

[75% of Turks thought problematic relations]{.underline} between Islamic
countries and the West **[were the West's fault]{.underline}**

[53% blamed **poverty** in Muslim countries on the West and
America]{.underline}

[82% had a negative opinion about Christians]{.underline}

only 9% believed Arab groups had carried out the 9/11 attacks

41% thought the most violent religion in the world is Judaism

[65% said they approved of Erdoğan's foreign policy]{.underline}

In August, the Washington-based Pew Research Center's global survey
found that **[72% of Turks saw America as a threat to their country's
security]{.underline}**. [In Turkey]{.underline}, a NATO member state,
[the US is perceived as]{.underline} **[a greater threat than Russia or
China]{.underline}**. "[**America's influence is a top concern in
Turkey**,"]{.underline} the survey read. "[This figure
\[72%]{.underline}\] **[is up 28 percentage points]{.underline}** since
2013, when just 44% named US power and influence as a major threat."

Bizarrely, [similar numbers of Turks view the US and ISIS as a threat to
their country.]{.underline} Pew did not ask Turks about their
perceptions of ISIS this year, but its 2015 research found that 73% of
Turks had a negative opinion of ISIS and 72% had a negative opinion of
America. (In that poll, 8% of Turks had a favorable opinion of ISIS
while 19% had no opinion.)

The explanations for anti-Americanism vary in different countries. For
instance, in Greece, the sentiment is a largely historical phenomenon,
as many blame the violent Greek civil war on the US. [In Turkey, it has
a different nature]{.underline}. [As Turkish society becomes more and
more ethnically and religiously conservative]{.underline} and
xenophobic, **[anti-American thinking gains ground and spreads to more
segments of the society.]{.underline}** [Erdoğan's]{.underline}
**[populist rhetoric only makes things worse.]{.underline}**

"It \[the presumed American hostility toward Turkey\] is because we are
Muslim," a schoolteacher explained to me when I asked her why she
thought America was conspiring against Turkey. Her husband, a government
banker, broadened the issue: "Also because we \[Turkey\] stand against
the Jewish oppression of the Palestinians ... America doesn't like
this."

[Such theories]{.underline}, **[pumped up by Erdoğan]{.underline}** and
his powerful media machinery, [are quite palatable to the conservative
masses]{.underline}, **[making this kind of manipulation a winning game
for Erdoğan]{.underline}**. [The more Turks feel "**imperial**"
again]{.underline} -- the more they believe they have a strong leader
and government at long last -- **[the more votes Erdoğan can
garner.]{.underline}**

In this game, [Erdoğan has to]{.underline} **[show that he really cares
about "my nation's foreign policy preferences"]{.underline}** -- a
concern he does in fact share. [The deal he offers is to make voters
feel proud **again in exchange for their support**]{.underline}. **[All
Erdoğan has to do is give the impression that he is
fighting]{.underline}** the world powers, **[America]{.underline}**
included. He then tells the world powers in private that they should
ignore his rhetoric, which is only for domestic consumption.

#### Turkey needs to remain strongly anti-American in order to shore up political support. Cooperation would be a [major reversal of policy]{.underline} which [undercuts]{.underline} Erdogan's base messaging

Over the past decade, [the Turkish government has slowly consolidated
its power]{.underline}; media outlets have been shut down, opposition
politicians have been jailed, and Turks have been arrested for social
media posts deemed critical of government policies.\[i\] [As the country
has shifted away from an open society and democratic
government]{.underline}, **[so too has it shifted away
from]{.underline}** its alliance with the country that long encouraged
these values: **[The United States]{.underline}**. In recent years,
**[Turkey]{.underline}** under current President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,
**[has]{.underline}** not only **[reoriented itself away
from]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) and its relations with the U.S., but has also
**[actively engaged]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[anti-American
messaging]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} **[anti-American propaganda
employed by Turkey's government]{.underline}** and pro-government allies
[has served to]{.underline} [**stoke anti-Americanism in Turkish
society** that has enabled the country's movement away from strategic
alignment]{.underline} with the West. This strategic shift has
geopolitical implications for the United States' strategic interests in
NATO and in the Middle East.

Turkey first aligned with the United States in the early years of the
Cold War. Joining NATO gave Turkey the promise of collective security in
reaction to a threatening Soviet Union to the north, while the United
States gained an ally strategically located on the Black Sea and the
Turkish Straits. However, this initial alliance did not mean that Turkey
always had strong pro-American feelings. At the height of the Cold War,
[strong]{.underline} **[anti-American factions emerged within the
Turkish ruling elite]{.underline}**. [These factions were representative
of]{.underline} a **[strong anti-American sentiment within the
population]{.underline}** that originated from Leftist circles.\[ii\]
After the Cold War, anti-American [feeling reemerged in Turkey over the
2003]{.underline} US invasion of Iraq. The Turkish parliament under the
Justice and Development Party (AKP) government---the first Islamist
party to successfully take and hold power and the party of
Erdoğan---rejected by three votes an agreement that would have allowed
American troops and military logistics to pass from Turkey into
Iraq.\[iii\] US **[favorability]{.underline}** with Turks
**[dropped]{.underline}** from 52% in 2000 **[to only 15%]{.underline}**
in 2003. [Turkish opinion]{.underline} of the U.S. **[has not
changed]{.underline}** since 2003, despite changes in US leadership.
\[iv\]

[Turkish leaders]{.underline} have **[capitalized on the strong
anti-American sentiment]{.underline}** [in the population to
make]{.underline} **[the U.S. a scapegoat in domestic messaging both
directly]{.underline}**---[through statements and public
comment]{.underline}s---and indirectly---through surrogates in the
Turkish media. Directly through government statements and comments,
[Erdoğan]{.underline} and his allies have [blamed the United States for
being **behind domestic problems**]{.underline} in Turkey. For example,
in 2016, many government officials labeled the U.S. as a major player in
planning a failed coup d'état in the country by a faction within the
military.\[v\] Turkey interpreted the Obama Administration's slowness to
condemn the unsuccessful coup as tacit approval, souring relations
between the two countries and [encouraging the use of anti-American
rhetoric]{.underline} by authorities.\[vi\] American support for Kurdish
forces in Syria, too, has drawn intense condemnation from Turkish
officials who accuse the U.S. of supporting terrorism and of seeking to
"encircling \[Turkey\] from the south" by enabling a proxy force along
Turkey's Syrian border capable of launching cross-border
incursions.\[vii\] Erdoğan has even hinted that the Turkish military
might target American forces embedded in Kurdish-held areas if they do
not withdraw.\[viii\] Indirectly, [the government has used its influence
over Turkish media to further spread anti-American
messages.]{.underline} Recent years of crackdowns against opposition
media and censorship of reporting have [reinforced the ability to spread
these messages across the Turkish media landscape]{.underline}.\[ix\]
Pro-government newspapers, such as Yeni Şafak, spread unsubstantiated
claims that the United States government actively broadcasts propaganda
of the Gülen movement, the religious-political movement that the
government blamed as behind the 2016 coup attempt.\[x\] [Even outlets
once deemed independent or even politicly opposed]{.underline} to the
Erdoğan government, such as the liberal Hürriyet, [publish
uncorroborrated claims that the United States controls Kurdish terrorist
groups]{.underline} opposed to the Turkish state.\[xi\] These media
proxies enable the Turkish government to amplify and promulgate
anti-American rhetoric.

The rise of anti-American rhetoric poses challenges to U.S.-Turkey
strategic relations. Turkey has long been a strategic ally for the U.S.,
both with its location south of an antagonistic Soviet Union---now a
Russian Federation seeking to restore its global clout---and with its
position to influence and project power into the Middle East and the
Eastern Mediterranean. However, [anti-American messaging]{.underline}
from the Turkish government has **[coincided with the country's broader
shift away from its ties]{.underline}** with the U.S. Since the 2016
coup, the government has purged large numbers of pro-NATO and
pro-American military personnel from the Turkish Armed Forces. Their
replacements have been those who support stronger ties with Russia,
China, and "Eastern" countries. These "Eurasianists," who increasingly
hold sway in top circles of Turkish leadership, reject strong ties with
the West, which they see as a threat to Turkey's strength and
independence.\[xii\] As this view becomes more prominent in Turkey, it
has challenged the cohesion of the NATO alliance. Without this cohesion,
the alliance will cease to serve the security interests of its
constituent members and could be compromised from within. For example,
The Turkish government recently leaked sensitive NATO intelligence,
including the locations of U.S. Special Forces bases in northern
Syria.\[xiii\]

[The Turkish government's]{.underline} **[anti-American messaging serves
as a tool to influence the domestic Turkish audience]{.underline}** and
gives justification for a strategic reorientation away from the U.S. and
the West. At the same time as it has pushed the country away from the
U.S., Turkey has sought to improve relations with Russia, at a time when
U.S.-Russian relations and NATO-Russia relations have reached a
nadir.\[xiv\] President Erdoğan has also publicly floated the idea of
joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security arrangement of
Eurasian states led by China and Russia.\[xv\] [By railing **against the
United States**]{.underline} in the domestic information environment,
the [Turkish government primes]{.underline} its population for
geo-strategic shifts away from the alignment with the U.S. and the West
with **[minimal domestic opposition.]{.underline}** If anti-Americanism
in Turkey continues, and the government's antipathy towards the U.S.
does not change, the United States' strategic interests in NATO and in
the Middle East will be seriously threatened.

### Link --- AI Catch All

#### Erdogan uses [AI-independence]{.underline} as point of national pride and prestige. Plan undermines it

**Shkurti, 21** --- PhD candidate at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University
(September 27, 2021, Gloria Shkurti, "Can Turkey's Artificial
Intelligence Strategy Be a Game Changer?; Turkey\'s publication of the
national artificial intelligence strategy is vital as it \"officially\"
brought Turkey into the AI race,"
<https://politicstoday.org/can-turkeys-artificial-intelligence-strategy-be-a-game-changer/>,
JMP)

[For Turkey, declaring its **own national AI strategy** is an important
step to becoming more influential in international affairs]{.underline}
and is highly important for tangible reasons. First and foremost, [there
is an ongoing AI race between several countries, with the U.S. and China
at the forefront]{.underline}. At this point, [the publication of the
national strategy]{.underline} of a country [is vital as it "officially"
brought Turkey into the AI race, **bolstering its competitiveness
regionally and globally**]{.underline}. [Having a leading role in the AI
industry is key for a **global leadership role** and a determinant in
power struggles.]{.underline} Countries with an effective national AI
strategy will have higher chances to leapfrog towards global leadership.

Most national AI strategies focus mainly on maximizing societal benefit.
However, [AI is a **military trump card** with a major impact on global
AI competition and the concomitant strengthening of national
security]{.underline}. It is very important that Turkey's national AI
strategy takes into account the military aspect. Leading countries in AI
R&D such as the U.S., China, and Russia have indicated their intentions
to use AI in the military field and increase their advantage. Turkey's
current national AI strategy does not have specific indications on how
AI will be applied in the military, and it is imperative that in the
following years Turkey announces a road map on how it intends to do so.

Another reason why the announcement of a national AI strategy is
important is related to R&D. The strategy itself, by providing a road
map, prompts research, development, and the adoption of AI. In this
regard, Turkey's national AI strategy is extremely adequate as it
clearly specifies the main steps that need to be followed by respective
institutions. Specifically, it prescribes the creation of new
institutions that will use AI R&D including the Department of Big Data
and Artificial Intelligence Applications under the Digital
Transformation Office and the TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence Institute.

Furthermore, to increase AI R&D, Turkey declared that AI-oriented
venture capital funds will be established and scaled up. This is a very
important step considering that the global AI funding has increased
extensively in the last years.

Seen from such a perspective, [Turkey's national AI strategy seems to be
effective]{.underline}; however, as mentioned previously, the
announcement of a national AI strategy is only a first step. Now,
[Turkey has to focus on the application of AI and the maximization of
its benefits]{.underline}. It is noteworthy to mention that [the more
efficient the adoption of the national strategy, the greater the gains
will be for Turkey]{.underline}.

[In terms of AI application in Turkey, there are several successful
examples]{.underline} that can be mentioned, [especially in terms of
military application]{.underline}. AI-augmented unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) produced by Turkey's state-owned company STM such as KARGU®,
ALPAGU®, and TOGAN® are great examples of Turkey's capabilities in the
AI race. At the same, STM is developing two other very promising
projects based on AI: the Swarm Intelligence UAV Project and the Kerkes
Project.

In the same context, as announced in April 2021 by Selçuk Bayraktar, the

[Turkey's flourishing drone industry]{.underline} is **[back in the
international spotlight]{.underline}** following a UN report suggesting
that [Turkish-made **artificial intelligence-based** drones]{.underline}
**[might have been used to kill enemy troops]{.underline}** in Libya
last year. If confirmed the incident would [mark the debut
of]{.underline} "**[killer robots" in the global theater of
war.]{.underline}**

The report by the UN Panel of Experts on Libya indicates that a Kargu-2
kamikaze drone manufactured by Turkey's state-owned company STM was
likely used in March 2020 in clashes between the forces of the
Turkish-backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan National
Army of eastern warlord Khalifa Hifter following the latter's
besiegement of Tripoli. Logistics convoys and retreating Hifter forces
"were hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial
vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM
Kargu-2 and other loitering munitions," the report says.
"[The]{.underline} **[lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed
to attack targets]{.underline}** without requiring data connectivity
between the operator and the munition: in effect, a true 'fire, forget
and find' capability," it noted without specifying whether anyone was
actually killed.

Turkish military sources familiar with the matter confirmed that
[Kargu-2s had been used]{.underline} in Libya on multiple occasions, but
denied that the drones --- which have both autonomous and manual
operation modes --- were [allowed to use]{.underline} **[artificial
intelligence to select and hit targets]{.underline}**. The [drones
operated]{.underline} **[autonomously only to reach target
areas]{.underline}**, after which operators on the ground made the
decisions to strike, the sources told Al-Monitor on condition of
anonymity.

STM describes Kargu-2 as a loitering rotary-wing attack drone with
real-time image processing capabilities and embedded machine learning
algorithms that are also equipped with swarming capabilities that allow
up to 20 drones to work together. In its autonomous mode, Kargu-2 can be
programmed to attack targets without data connectivity between the
ground unit/operator and the munition.

The [UN report was met with **nationalist euphoria** in Turkey's
pro-government media,]{.underline} **[which lauded Kargu-2 as further
proof of how far the domestic defense industry has progressed

Ever since the outbreak of the Ukraine-Russia war, the [Turkish
government]{.underline} under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been
busy [trying to restore its alliance with the West]{.underline} after a
period of discord following its acquisition of Russian S-400 missiles.
Appearing at the NATO summit in Brussels and hosting a number of Western
leaders in Ankara since the invasion, [Erdogan seems eager to go back to
business as usual with Turkey's Western allies]{.underline}. However,
**[the Turkish public is not as fast in readjusting its position
vis-à-vis the West]{.underline}** [as its president who had
been]{.underline} **[galvanising anti-Westernism up until very
recently.]{.underline}**

A poll conducted by Metropoll in January shows that [Russia and China
have]{.underline} **[outdone the US and the EU in winning the sympathy
of ordinary Turks.]{.underline}** While 37.5 per cent of respondents say
that Turkey should prioritise the EU and the US in its foreign affairs
[39.4 per cent prefer Russia and China.]{.underline} Even after the
invasion of Ukraine by Russia, according to a Metropoll survey in March,
29.5 per cent of Turks still think that relations with Russia and China
should be given priority. It seems that, in recent years, [an eastern
foreign policy orientation]{.underline} for Turkey **[has gained
significant acceptance]{.underline}** in a NATO member and EU candidate
country. The poll also reveals that not only the voters of Erdogan's AKP
but **[also the base of opposition parties favour Russia and
China.]{.underline}**

[Western scepticism surfaces]{.underline} **[even in the context of the
Russian aggression]{.underline}** in Ukraine. A recent survey reveals
that [only 33.7 per cent of Turks think Russia is responsible for the
war in Ukraine]{.underline} while [48.3 per cent say that it is the
responsibility of the US and NATO.]{.underline}

These [figures]{.underline} **[reflect a deep-rooted
anti-Westernism]{.underline}** among the Turkish people that has been
stirred under the rule of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP).
[The scope of anti-Westernism]{.underline} **[raises questions about the
prospect of Turkey as an ally of the West in the long
run]{.underline}**. [Given the]{.underline} **[prevailing scepticism
toward the West and emerging sympathy for Russia and
China,]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} **[rehabilitation of the alliance
with the West may be too optimistic]{.underline}** -- even in a
post-Erdogan Turkey.

While [the Erdogan government presented the West as the **mother of all
evils**]{.underline}, pl[otting against]{.underline} **[Turkey's
economy, sovereignty, and security]{.underline}** until very recently,
the [impact of the AKP's anti-Western narratives]{.underline} could
**[have remained limited if it had not established a propaganda
network]{.underline}** controlling all communication channels except
social media. The Turkish public has never been exposed to such
continuous and orchestrated narratives about how the West plotted
against Turkey. [The AKP has built a discursive hegemony
effectively]{.underline} **[delegitimising any expression of favourable
views of the West.]{.underline}**

As the masses were manipulated by Erdogan's propaganda machine,
[opposition parties]{.underline} [were also trapped to echo the
prevailing negative perception of the West]{.underline}, effectively
normalising and further popularising the AKP's anti-Western narrative.

Besides, the growing anti-Westernism in Turkey can also be attributed to
the successful efforts of a minor but resourceful Eurasianist clique,
especially among the retired military officers, with whom the Erdogan
government has formed a political alliance after the 2016 coup attempt.

Since the late 1990s, [they have been consistently calling for
a]{.underline} **[strategic move of abandoning the West and embracing
the East]{.underline}**. Invigorated by Turkey's growing strategic ties
with Russia and China and as a partner of the ruling party, the
Eurasianists gained a new position of influence in the public debate on
the question of Turkey's direction towards the West or the East. Often
appearing on government-controlled media, [the Eurasianists have turned
the anti-Western rhetoric of the ruling party into favourable views
towards **Russia and China.**]{.underline}

While the anti-Western narratives dominated the public debate, [there
has been **no significant political actor,** ideological or social group
**that would defend Turkey's traditional Western
vocation.**]{.underline}

[Turkish leftists have always been critical towards the
West]{.underline} and understood it as the hotbed of imperialism, a
position that helped spread and further legitimise the AKP's
anti-Western stand, especially among the secularists. [The
secularists]{.underline}, in turn, with their leftist and rightist
variants, [have developed a strong distaste for the West despite their
apparently Western lifestyle.]{.underline} They tend to believe that the
Western powers pursued a 'green belt' policy during the Cold War years
working together with Islamists throughout the Middle East and more
recently have supported moderate Islamists including the AKP in Turkey.

Finally, there's a widespread belief among the Turks that Western states
and organisations have been aiding the separatist Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) in Turkey and its offspring, the People's Defense Units
(YPG), ) in Syria. This has spurred and cemented anti-Westernism across
the political spectrum.

[Despite President Erdogan's very recent U-turn]{.underline}, **[it is
extremely rare to see public advocacy for a Western outlook in Turkey's
foreign policy]{.underline}**. Those who remain committed to Turkey's
traditional Western-oriented foreign policy represent a silent group
without political and intellectual representation or the institutional
backing of the military, once a staunch defender of Turkey's Western
direction. **[Public debates continue to be dominated by anti-Western
and Eurasianist personalities and ideas.]{.underline}**

As the Ukrainian crisis evolves, the Turkish president makes overtures
to Turkey's Western allies. But [the anti-Westernism that he has
fostered among the Turkish people **remains an obstacle to usher a new
era of cooperation.**]{.underline}

[When Turkish voters go to the polls in coming elections in 2023,
**Erdogan's political future will be decided**]{.underline}. It is a
critical election for a man who loathes losing an election and despairs
of what the future holds for him if the voters reject his bid for
re-election. A relaxing life in retirement would not await him after
having violated the human rights of thousands of Turkish citizens, been
the subject of the anti-corruption investigations based on solid
evidence, and been responsible for financing and sponsoring jihadist
groups operating in conflict zones.

Erdogan's domestic politics are based on the consolidation of power into
himself through three distinct actions. First, Erdogan works to send a
strong message to the people that his leadership of the country is an
insurance of Islamic freedom for his followers who for many years have
complained about the pressures of a secular system. The people who fall
for this message strongly believe that, under Erdogan's rule, mosques
will be open and women will be allowed to wear headscarves in schools
and in state institutions. Second, Erdogan used economic-development
projects during the early years of his presidency to send a message that
Turkey and its citizens are prospering financially thanks to his
leadership. Third, [Erdogan works to craft]{.underline} **[a foreign
policy message that portrays him as a powerful leader who can defy all
of Turkey's "Western enemies]{.underline}**." [An example of
this]{.underline} message in practice [is]{.underline} [Erdogan's
**stance on**]{.underline} the expansion of **[NATO.]{.underline}** To
win the support of Turkey's nationalistic voters, Erdogan stresses his
opposition to allowing Finland and Sweden to join NATO.

In the [face of an uncertain outcome in the coming
elections]{.underline} in 2023, [Erdogan]{.underline} knows that with
the financial situation in Turkey [he cannot play the economy-is-booming
card to rally voter support for his re-election]{.underline}. [All
Erdogan has left is]{.underline} his political Islamist identity and a
**[rowdy attitude toward the world]{.underline}**. Erdogan's [strategy
of not focusing on the economy]{.underline} may **[serve him well in his
bid for a return to office]{.underline}** because [Turkey's nationalist
voters]{.underline} **[increasingly tend to agree with Erdogan's
approach to foreign politics.]{.underline}**

To conclude, [the world will be watching to see whether **Erdogan** can
succeed by openly playing hi**s** **trump cards** in]{.underline} the
**[arena of international politics]{.underline}**. Putin's threat to
veto NATO expansion most likely will force Finland and Sweden to knock
even louder on NATO's door, which in turn will create more leverage for
Erdogan to get what he wants from EU and U.S. The world also will be
watching to see how much the EU and U.S. will surrender to Erdogan's
self-interest wishes. If Erdogan succeeds at striking several pigeons
[with]{.underline} one bean, then other authoritarian leaders around the
world will emulate the Turkish leader's strategy and usher in a new
playbook for international politics with instructions on how
authoritarian leaders can achieve their goals at the expense of the
country and the people who live there.

#### Erdogan campaigns [against NATO]{.underline} to distract from economic problems

**Rubin 2019 ---** Michael Rubin \"WHY THE TURKISH PRESIDENT REVELS IN
CONSPIRACY THEORIES\" March 7, 2019.
advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5VKJ-XJ71-JCBF-S2RN-00000-00&context=1516831.
Accessed June 23, 2022. WMK

It was [simply the latest temper tantrum for]{.underline} Turkey\'s
mercurial leader Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}. \"**[What kind of
NATO alliance is this]{.underline}**?\" [he said]{.underline} in
mid-February **[during an election]{.underline}** [rally]{.underline}
ahead of March\'s local elections. \"You give terrorists around 23,000
truckloads of weapons and tools through Iraq, but when we asked, you
won\'t even sell them to us,\" he added.

On its face, this is nonsense. The United States began supporting Syrian
Kurds fighting the Islamic State against the backdrop of the 20142015
Siege of Kobane , in which Syrian Kurdish fighters stood their ground
and ultimately rebuffed an Islamic State assault on the border town. Not
only did Turkey refuse to support the resistance to the Islamic State
for the bulk of the siege, but it also allowed its border to be used to
support and supply the Islamic State; and 90 percent of Islamic State
foreign fighters during the period traversed the Turkish border, often
with Turkish government facilitation.

While Erdogan considers Syrian Kurdish militias to be terrorists because
of their links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey, his
insistence that all Syrian Kurds be stigmatized as terrorists because of
their ethnicity has undercut the seriousness with which his diplomatic
entreaties are accepted. So too has the tendency of his own forces to
engage in ethnic and cultural cleansing of historically Kurdish towns
and villages in Syria occupied on supposed counter-terror grounds.

A broader reason for Western and European cynicism toward Erdogan\'s
complaints is the growing evidence that much of the terrorism about
which Erdogan complains is actually sponsored by Erdogan himself as a
means to demonize political enemies and fuel the emergencies which allow
him to consolidate power. In effect, Erdogan has become the twenty-first
century\'s chief peddler of the \"Reichstag Fire\" strategy. Just as
Germany\'s Nazis blamed rivals for burning down Germany\'s Reichstag
(parliament) building and used the crisis to suspend civil liberties and
deepen Nazi control of the state, so too does Erdogan repeatedly promote
false conspiracies in order to consolidate his control.

The Turkish government (initially perhaps with the support of its
then-allies in exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen\'s movement) promoted two
patently false coup plots in order to marginalize secularists within the
Turkish military. By the time the conspiracies had unraveled, Erdogan
had succeeded in ruining his opponents\' careers and utilizing the
accusations to fast-track the dismantling of the check-and-balance
system that saw the military act as guarantors of the constitution.

It\'s not a coincidence that the worst terrorist attacks in Turkey occur
before elections. Consider the bombing of an October 2015 peace rally in
Ankara. While the Islamic State perpetrated that attack, the notion that
Erdogan was responsible was not a conspiracy. Ahval, a
professionally-operated independent portal that reports news which
Erdogan no longer allows Turkish newspapers to cover, revealed a
European Union intelligence report which assessed that \"forces within
the AKP commissioned the Da\'esh \[Islamic State\] operatives.\"

There was the July 2016 abortive coup attempt , which Erdogan used both
to launch a purge of opponents and to declare a state of emergency which
allowed him to achieve in practice what Turkish law prohibited. While
Erdogan blamed the coup on one-time ally gulen (and some gulenists may,
indeed, have participated), the narrative Erdogan embraces and insists
the Turkish press amplify seems no more real than the earlier alleged
coup plots and the Ankara bombing. Indeed, many questions remain
unanswered .

The inexcusable (though now resolved) detention of Pastor Andrew Brunson
and then continued detention of other American and Turkish Americans
like NASA scientist Serkan Golge [reflects]{.underline} more on the
**[desire of Erdogan to fan anti-Americanism]{.underline}** [and fuel
the **paranoid fantasies of his followers**]{.underline} than any notion
of evidence or justice.

[Erdogan may now spin]{.underline} **[conspiracies about alleged U.S.
and NATO support]{.underline}** for terrorism. And, [he will **fuel**
the]{.underline} already **[endemic anti-Americanism]{.underline}**
[inside Turkey]{.underline} by doing so. There is nothing to be done
about that other than clear, persistent, and daily pushback to expose
reality to Turks conditioned by Erdogan\'s lies. But [with the Turkish
**economy teetering**]{.underline} and Turkish forces increasingly
bogged down in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, [Erdogan]{.underline}, of
course, [has no interest in the truth]{.underline}. His [only real goal
remains to **fan the flames of hatred in order to distract from his own
sorry economic and military record.**]{.underline}

[Anti-Western narratives t]{.underline}hat the war has accentuated
**[echo within far-left circles]{.underline}** as well. [At the center
of the denunciation of the West **is anti-Americanism**]{.underline}.

Following the acquittals of various politi­cal and security factions in
the early 2010s in the Ergenekon and Sledgehammer trials, [it is no
coincidence that they did not shy away from endorsing and even
shaping]{.underline} -- implicitly and explicitly -- some of the
[**AKP's foreign policy adventures**, and that they are now watching the
invasion closely]{.underline}. As important carriers of Eurasianism in
today's Turkey, [these actors see the war in Ukraine first and foremost
as a proxy war]{.underline} between the [US]{.underline} (in cooperation
with Europe and NATO), on the one hand, [and Russia and China on the
other.]{.underline} They also approach the war as the new militarized
phase of a process through which the cen­ter of gravity is shifting to
Asia.

[**A general bitterness about the US underlines this view.** The
perceived attempts by the US to push Turkey away from]{.underline}
[**Russia by utilizing the war in Ukraine are seen** as part of a
longstanding trend to pull Turkey]{.underline} **[into the American
sphere of influence]{.underline}** following the fall of the Soviet
Union (a view para­doxically shared by Islamists as well). The post--Cold
War history of US-Turkey rela­tions is accordingly one of resistance by
the Turkish Armed Forces against the US and the collaborative Turkish
governments attempting to get Turkey to act as a satellite country to
further American interests in the Middle East. Not only are the undue
Sledge­hammer and Ergenekon trials, which led to the arrest of many
high-ranking military officers on allegations of coup-plotting against
the AKP government, seen as an American conspiracy, but also the failed
2016 coup attempt.

As the logic of the narrative goes, [the Turkish military's objection
to]{.underline} [**unconditional alignment with US interests** during
the post--Cold War era was a direct chal­lenge to "US hegemony,
furthering Ameri­can interests]{.underline} behind the cover of a
rule-based international order." This desire to withstand perceived US
unilateralism is the root cause of aspirations to build close ties with
Russia and China.

[Anti-American narratives also spread beyond the
**Eurasianists**]{.underline} and echo among the secularist nationalist
far left (the so-called ulusalcılar). [Russia is generously spared
criticism and **NATO is perceived as the main culprit of the war**.
Security anxieties]{.underline} abound [over the belief that the US is
instigating the wa]{.underline}r as an **[opportunity to pressure
Turkey]{.underline}** to apply the Montreux Convention liberally in
order [to]{.underline} **[enhance]{.underline}** the "**[NATO
presence]{.underline}** in Black Sea," which would in turn harm
"Turkish-Russian co­operation."

For these actors, the [denunciation of the US and NATO has **deeper
roots**]{.underline} [and reflects long-standing]{.underline} **[Cold
War grievances]{.underline}**. Accord­ingly, Tu[rkey's participation in
NATO is seen as the **core reason behind the growth of
ultranationalism**]{.underline} (associated with the Grey Wolves) and
political Islam as the ideo­logical currents that formed the back­bone of
anti-communist rhetoric as well as the organizational networks that
undergirded anti-communist mobilization in Turkey. The original sin --
the rise of anti-communism and the simultaneous fall of the Turkish left
-- according to this view continues to ensure that pro-NATO atti­tudes
dominate Turkish politics, even today.

Even though the [possibility of a growing]{.underline} **[American
influence over Turkey]{.underline}** through Erdoğan's seeming
rapprochement with [NATO remains a concern]{.underline} fo**[r different
fac­tions]{.underline}** of the far left, Ankara's [ongoing emphasis on
Turkey's]{.underline} **[autonomous foreign policy]{.underline}** and
[Erdoğan's]{.underline} recalcitrant, **[critical tone of the West
appear to have partially eased these anxieties for the
moment.]{.underline}**

[Russia's]{.underline} unprovoked [war of aggression in
Ukraine]{.underline} has [forced countries around the world to reexamine
their geopolitical choices. Turkey]{.underline}, a strategic partner to
both of the states at war, [has been affected more than most
nations]{.underline}. Caught in a lose-lose situation where taking any
side in the conflict would lead to a major rupture with the other
partner, [it has tried to maintain amicable relations with both Russia
and Ukraine.]{.underline}

At the same time, [the war has given Turkish leadership a chance to turn
the challenges of this shaky equilibrium into an opportunity by
positioning Ankara as a potential mediator]{.underline} between Moscow
and Kyiv.

[While brokering]{.underline} a [quick peace]{.underline} or even a
ceasefire in this war [is highly unlikely]{.underline} in the short
term, [Turkey nonetheless had a unique opportunity]{.underline} to mend
its shattered relations with the West.

However, nearly [four months into the war,]{.underline} **[hopes for
such a rapprochement are starting to fade]{.underline}**, as [Turkey's
balancing act gives way to a **tilt toward Moscow**]{.underline}. [If
Turkey wants to use the crisis to build bridges with the
West,]{.underline} **[its time is running out.]{.underline}**

Promising start

Prior to Russia's invasion, Turkey and Ukraine had begun to develop a
defense industry partnership that served as a security boost for both
nations. It also drew praise for anchoring Turkey in the West, seemingly
at the cost of deeper military ties between Ankara and Moscow.

[Turkey has been firm in its political support for the territorial
integrity of Ukraine]{.underline} and has consistently refused to
recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Over the past few
months, it has dismissed Russian criticism to deliver "Bayraktar" drones
to Ukraine. In the early stages of the war, it closed off the Bosporus
and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships, further raising hopes that it
would align with the rest of NATO in Ukraine's defense.

Meanwhile, Turkey's [active diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution
of the conflict have also garnered public praise from its NATO
allies]{.underline}---something Turkish leadership highly appreciated
after years of frosty relations with the West and with national
elections looming in 2023. Senior American diplomats have made several
visits to Turkey since the April launch of a new US-Turkey Strategic
Mechanism aimed at normalizing bilateral relations. Turkish Foreign
Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has traveled to the United States to meet
Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the first bilateral meeting of
cabinet officials since President Joe Biden took office.

For the first time in a while, [Turkey was not only acting in line with
transatlantic allies but also taking a lead]{.underline} in the region
in a way that has bolstered its importance as a key NATO member. [US
officials have gone as far as to suggest that Turkey transfer its S-400
missile-defense systems to Ukraine]{.underline} in a bid to finally
solve the problem of Russian air defense systems stationed in a NATO
member state and the consequent Western sanctions imposed on Ankara.

**[Turkey has bluntly rejected that proposal.]{.underline}**

Instead, it [has slowly **allowed domestic problems,**]{.underline}
regional geopolitics, and pragmatism to **[dictate its approach to the
war]{.underline}**. As a result, [Turkish leadership once again appears
eager to **continue business as usual with an increasingly isolated
Russia.**]{.underline}

straits]{.underline} for the naval ships of states at war under Article
19 of the Montreux Convention, [Ankara has denied access to non-littoral
NATO states as well]{.underline}. Turkey's fears of losing out to the
West in its ambitions for a kind of regional ownership of the Black Sea
prevailed over the security threats posed by Russia.

[Turkey's desire to limit the **presence of NATO**]{.underline} vessels
in the Black Sea, which might lead to further escalation with Russia,
[is understandable]{.underline}---even if not in line with the
Alliance's objectives. It is harder to justify the statements of Turkish
Defense Minister Hulusi Akar wondering whether mines discovered in the
Black Sea had been laid there deliberately to create an excuse for NATO
minesweepers to enter those waters.

[Turkey is also **blocking the quick addition of Sweden and
Finland**]{.underline} to NATO, [trying to use the situation to solve
its own problems and voice its own security concerns]{.underline}. It is
highly unlikely that Turkish leadership will block the membership of the
two Nordic countries in the long term. Nevertheless, [its current
diplomatic bargaining has revealed major differences in threat
perceptions]{.underline} as seen from Ankara and other capitals. While
for most of the European states, the major threat on NATO's eastern
borders is a revisionist Russia, for Turkey it is Kurdish People's
Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) fighters
operating in Syria and allegedly finding a safe haven in Finland and
Sweden.

Obviously, **[skyrocketing anti-American sentiments]{.underline}** in
Turkey [and a traditional mistrust for the West]{.underline} **[limit
the possibilities for cooperation on Ukraine]{.underline}**. [Whereas
the majority of Turks support Ukraine in this war]{.underline}, **[polls
show that more than 48 percent blame the United States]{.underline}** or
NATO for the conflict [while only 34 percent hold Russia
responsible.]{.underline} There is a [widespread belief]{.underline} in
Turkish society that [the war in Ukraine is just another regional
conflict instigated by Western powers]{.underline} after Afghanistan,
Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others. Russia's invasions and aggression in in
South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, and more
recently in Ukraine and Syria don't evoke a similar response among
Turks.

**[Populist rhetoric]{.underline}**, [burgeoning ahead of]{.underline}
**[next year's elections]{.underline}**, [as well as massive
anti-Western propaganda]{.underline} on Turkish media mostly featuring
retired generals, nationalist pundits, and (pro-)Russian experts with a
strong Eurasianist agenda, **[do not help]{.underline}** either.

President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan's economic and strategic
agendas]{.underline} also [**depend on close coordination with Moscow.**
Russia supplies]{.underline} almost [half of Turkish domestic gas
demand, provides tech]{.underline}nology [for the country's first
nuclear power plant]{.underline} in Akkuyu, and [serves as the source of
more than five million tourists annually]{.underline}. The Kremlin's
support is also vital for Turkey to maintain its presence in the South
Caucasus and Middle East.

The recent meeting of Çavuşoğlu with his Russian counterpart Sergei
Lavrov in Ankara clearly showed that Turkey is keen to stick to
mechanisms for cooperation with Russia, like the Astana Platform in
Syria or the 3+3 format in the South Caucuses (which also involves Iran,
Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). Instead of using this crisis as a
chance to decrease its strategic dependence on Russia, **[Turkey seems
eager to bind itself even more to Moscow within new
formats.]{.underline}**

Money matters

Ukraine has so far largely respected Turkey's sensitivities and not
pushed too hard on sanctions, instead focusing on arms supplies and
Ankara's mediator role. However, that dynamic is coming under stress
with Russian oligarchs using Turkey as a safe haven to bypass European
Union restrictions.

According to Lavrov's recent statements, Russia-Turkey bilateral trade
doubled in the first quarter of 2022, and [there are now ongoing talks
on **expanding the use of Russia's MIR payments system**]{.underline} in
Turkey. In March, [Erdoğan suggested to Putin]{.underline} [**that their
countries switch to national currencies or gold** in commercial
deals]{.underline} [instead of the dollar or euro.]{.underline} Izzet
Ekmekcibashi, the head of the Turkish-Russian Business Council (DEIK),
said that mor[e than one thousand new Russian companies opened in Turkey
**in March alone.**]{.underline} Most recently, [a well-connected
Turkish journalist reported on a Russian-Turkish agreement]{.underline}
to [move the European headquarters of forty-three leading Russian
companies including Gazprom]{.underline} **[to Turkey]{.underline}**.

Turkish-Russian cooperation in tourism has also quickly developed.
Turkish media outlets have reported that Turkish carriers are operating
438 flights per week to Russia this summer at a time when sanctions have
made it difficult for Moscow to arrange flights. According to the
pro-government Sabah newspaper, Turkish Airlines has signed a deal to
bring 1.5 million Russian tourists over in 2022. The newspaper's report
suggests that Ankara also plans to issue loans under state guarantees to
support Turkish travel companies working with Russian tourists and back
a new airline with the specific mandate of transporting Russian tourists
to Turkey.

Ankara, which earlier called on Moscow to end its blockade of Ukrainian
ports so grain exports could restart, is now taking a more pro-Russia
position, advocating for the international community to help unblock not
only Ukraine's but also Russia's trade in grain and fertilizers through
safe logistics, ship insurance, and a return of Russian banks to the
SWIFT system. During Lavrov's recent visit to Turkey, Çavuşoğlu said
that Turkey considered Moscow's demands "reasonable" and "feasible" and
backed easing Western sanctions against Russia.

[There is]{.underline} also [ample evidence of Ankara's involvement in
the illegal shipment and trade of Ukrainian grain stolen by Russian
forces]{.underline} to the Middle East via the Turkish ports of Samsun,
Derince, Bandırma, and Iskenderun. So far, despite strong evidence of
Russian crimes and official appeals from Ukraine, Turkish authorities
have remained silent on these cases.

These [moves by Turkey don't just undermine its credibility as a
mediator between Ukraine and Russia]{.underline} **[but also raise
questions about Ankara's geopolitical choices in a broader regional and
transatlantic framework]{.underline}**. A[s it leans toward Russia in a
bid for stability]{.underline} at home, **[Turkey risks finding itself
estranged from the West and aligned with a pariah state on the
international arena]{.underline}**. The Ukrainian case will become a
major test for Turkey. Whether Ankara prefers to use it to bridge the
gaps with the West or to burn the bridges remains to be seen.

### Security Mechanism Link Mod/AT: Thumper

#### [Security mechanism]{.underline} fails now because of lack of [US security cooperation]{.underline} --- BUT this is [another link]{.underline} because the AFF would make it [credible]{.underline}

Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. His research

[The mechanism]{.underline} grew out of an understanding reached between
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and U.S. President Joe Biden
during their meeting on the margins of the October 2021 G20 summit in
Rome. Though the idea is said to belong to Biden, [the U.S. readout
after the meeting **lacked any reference to the
mechanism**]{.underline}, whereas it was the highlight of the Turkish
narrative. [This difference in emphasis]{.underline} initially
**[triggered rumors that the United States might be dragging its
feet.]{.underline}**

After the initiative was announced, U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for
International Trade Marisa Lago visited Turkey to explore opportunities
in commercial relations and to discuss how Turkey's Russia-dependent
energy mix could be diversified. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt
Çavuşoğlu will travel to the United States to meet with U.S. Secretary
of State Antony Blinken on May 18 in the first cabinet-level bilateral
visit between the two countries since the Biden administration took
office. The initial plans had been to have this meeting in Washington,
DC, but the venue has been moved to New York, and the program has been
curtailed, reportedly at the behest of the United States and probably in
reaction to the conviction of Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala. While
the process hasn't been derailed, this experience serves as a reminder
that the mechanism is vulnerable to different dynamics[. Its
sustainability and **potential to have a positive impact**]{.underline}
[depend on]{.underline} Ankara and **[Washington making the right
choices to facilitate]{.underline}** and not undermine **[policy
convergences.]{.underline}**

Turkish and American sources talk of the Strategic Mechanism as a
structured platform in which all matters can be discussed, with an
emphasis on advancing practical bilateral cooperation. [The]{.underline}
[**level of ambition** that Ankara and Washington will set]{.underline}
for the mechanism **[is yet to be seen and will be
important]{.underline}**, [particularly in view of]{.underline} the
**[failure of some past attempts]{.underline}**. The two [governments
established working]{.underline} groups in 2018 to [resolve disputes on
consular affairs, Syria policy, and Turkey's purchase of the Russian
S-400 air defense system]{.underline}, **[but these efforts failed to
deliver results]{.underline}** and were quickly forgotten. [The United
States had been]{.underline} **[reluctant to go forward with the idea at
the time]{.underline}**, and the lesson from that experience is that,
unless the parties have a shared sense of understanding of and joint
commitment to the process, its chances of success are slim.

If the Strategic Mechanism is to avoid the fate of the 2018 working
groups, [Washington]{.underline} and Ankara [will need to **invest
seriously in the process and display real political
ownership;**]{.underline} agree on clear, shared, and diverse
objectives; and simultaneously work to resolve or at least minimize
their bilateral disputes.

DEMONSTRATING POLITICAL OWNERSHIP

[The mechanism will be]{.underline} **[dead on arrival]{.underline}**
[unless there is]{.underline} shared **[commitment in]{.underline}**
Ankara and **[Washington]{.underline}**. Geopolitical considerations are
currently driving this commitment in both countries. Russia's brazen war
in Ukraine and the global divide of systemic rivalry have affected how
Turkey and the United States view each other. These events have changed
their calculus in favor of closer relations and, in turn, have nurtured
the idea of such a mechanism.

For Turkey, balancing Russia has consistently been a consideration. From
Ankara's perspective, the reality is that its security, deterrence, and
economic livelihood are bolstered by its membership in NATO, its
alliance with the United States, and its albeit shaky inclusion nowadays
in the family of liberal democracies. Meanwhile, the Turkish economy is
in dire straits as the country's 2023 parliamentary and presidential
elections loom on the horizon, forcing the government into looking for
international success stories. The United States, on the other hand, is
grappling with the fact that Turkey is a significant geopolitical middle
power in its immediate region and beyond. Having Turkey as an ally has
started to matter more again. In short, realpolitik calculations are at
play for both sides.

For the purposes of optics and practicality, the [Strategic Mechanism
would benefit from being designed]{.underline} and **[seen as something
more than a bureaucratic exercise]{.underline}**. For this to happen,
[it needs a]{.underline} **[meaningful political embrace]{.underline}**
from both sides. Underscoring the mechanism's importance with a meeting
between the two countries' presidents would give it a big boost. **[It
is no secret that the Biden administration has been cold-shouldering
Turkey.]{.underline}** [This has been evident in the choice Biden and
his senior team have made to limit their interactions]{.underline} with
their Turkish counterparts, something that Erdoğan has publicly
lamented.

accessed 6-24-2022, WMK

"The [launch of the mechanism]{.underline} is certainly the prelude to a
more constructive era in the relationship," Sinan Ulgen, a former
diplomat and visiting fellow of Carnegie Europe, told Al-Monitor. "It
**[will not be a cure-all to all the tough spots in the
relations]{.underline}** - [from the US policy on Syria to Turkey's
acquisition of Russia's S-400 missile defense system]{.underline} - but
neither should it be dismissed as window dressing. The mechanism
provides a comprehensive platform, with consultations at different
levels, to deepen cooperation on issues such as trade or regional
hotspots."

The process was accelerated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ulgen
said. Wendy Sherman, US Deputy Secretary of State, came to Ankara ten
days later and underscored the importance of the strategic mechanism.

[Disputes]{.underline} between Ankara and Washington [include Turkey\'s
acquisition of S-400 missile defense systems]{.underline} from Russia,
[Washington's cooperation with the]{.underline} Syrian-Kurdish People's
Protection Units ([YPG]{.underline}) militia, [policy differences on
Libya and the eastern Mediterranean, as well as human rights
issues.]{.underline} Moreover, Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdogan
has taken]{.underline}** US President Joe **[Biden's lack of engagement
as a personal affront]{.underline}**.

Ankara sources say that the reconciliation efforts have intensified with
the arrival of new US Ambassador Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican
senator who went against his party to endorse Biden's presidency and a
former member of the Senate Foreign Relations, Energy and Natural
Resources committees. "He knows how Washington works, and he is eager to
use his knowledge, ties, and time here to improve and deepen Turkey's
relations with Washington," said one diplomatic source in Ankara.

The open line between Onal and Nuland is essential, but it still falls
short of the regular contact with US President Joe Biden that Erdogan
craves, Cagaptay told Al-Monitor. "The Ukrainian war is a blessing and a
curse for Erdogan,\" he said. \"It has acted as a catalyst that has
pushed Turkey out of isolation with NATO and its Western allies. But it
is also a curse because if the war goes on, it comes with political and
economic costs, particularly if Ankara were forced to take steps that
would antagonize Russia.\"

US Department of Commerce undersecretary Marisa Lago visits Ankara on
April 5-6 to advance the mechanism's economic and trade cooperation
goals. Given the economic situation in Turkey, Erdogan needs a narrative
of good relations with Washington to woo foreign investment, Cagaptay
said. "So it would be good for him to be on regular calls with Biden,
but Biden has neither the bandwidth nor the inclination at this stage."

While Nuland said in an interview with Hurriyet Daily News' Serkan
Demirtas that the new mechanism would allow meetings at the ministerial
or even presidential level, no Turkish pundit would yet like to bet on a
face-to-face meeting between Erdogan and Biden, particularly after such
a meeting failed to materialize at the fringes of the NATO summit in
Brussels last month, despite Turkish side's hints.

Such [a meeting]{.underline} \"**[is unlikely to happen as long as the
S-400 issue remains unsolved,"]{.underline}** opined Cagaptay. [After
Turkey bought the S-400s from Russia, the United States expelled Turkey
from the F-35 joint strike fighter program]{.underline}. [Turkey's
request to upgrade its existing F-16 fleet]{.underline} and buy new
F-16s [has been snagged by Congress.]{.underline}

"There is the possibility of progress on the F-16 issue - at least from
the administration if not from the Congress," said Ulgen. In a letter
dated March 17, the State Department said the potential sale of F-16
fighter jets to Turkey would be in line with US national security
interests and would also serve NATO's long-term unity, Reuters reported.

But Ulgen cautioned [that it would be more difficult for both Ankara and
Washington to **come to terms on S-400 missiles**.]{.underline} "[Their
current positions]{.underline} **[seem starkly apart]{.underline}**,"
Ulgen told Al-Monitor. "Both sides will need to show flexibility there."

In March, [Sherman suggested that Turkey send its S-400 missiles to
Ukraine]{.underline}, with whom Ankara has a military cooperation
accord. **[Turkey flatly refused]{.underline}**.

First, Turkey and the West (particularly the US), can take steps to
consolidate their geo­political convergence. It is notable in this
respect is that the Biden administration has told Congress that meeting
Turkey's request to purchase F-16 jets and modernisation kits would
serve US national security inter­ests and NATO's long-term unity in light
of the war in Ukraine. However, on the F‑16 question, **[Turkey is
facing the opposition of a hostile US]{.underline}** Congress. But if
the Biden administration uses its political capital and this purchase
goes through, it could signifi­cantly improve Turkish-US relations and
po­tentially pave the ground for more serious engagement to find a
formula to address the S‑400 crisis -- probably this crisis can not be
resolved soon but it can be better managed so that it does not
contaminate the overall Turkish -- US relations. [Another]{.underline}
positive [development is that the US-Turkey launched]{.underline} a new
"[Strategic Mechanism"]{.underline} to review bilateral topics to boost
ties. [But if Turkey's problematisation of the Swedish and Finnish NATO
membership bids is not resolved]{.underline}, ideally before the next
NATO meet­ing on 30 June 2022 in Madrid, **[this can then easily dispel
the recent positive atmos­phere in Turkey-Western/NATO
relations]{.underline}**, [which was largely a result of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. On the Turkey-EU level, launching a
more structured foreign policy dialogue between Ankara and Brus­sels,
including a potential Turkish role in the EU's Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP), paired with more clarity on the part of the EU
on the role of non-EU NATO members, namely Turkey, the UK and the US, in
the new European security architecture can further aid and sustain this
process of convergence. Indeed, with­out a presence or contribution of
these three actors, no serious European security order can be
established, yet their roles remain undefined in the European debate on
this prospective order.

Yet, the facts on the ground point out to a different reality. The
[latest wave of]{.underline} **[anti-Americanism in
Turkey]{.underline}** [has a **much larger scale and scope than previous
ones.**]{.underline} [Putting Turkish-American relations back on
track]{.underline} **[may prove an insurmountable
challenge]{.underline}** [when]{.underline} **[both the Turkish body
politic and public opinion is caught in an anti-Western nationalist
frenzy]{.underline}**. Most opinion polls show that about **[80 percent
of Turks consider the United States the country\'s top national-security
threat.]{.underline}** Almost [90 percent support the Turkish military
incursion]{.underline} in Afrin, in northern Syria. That operation,
though now largely over, **[could still escalate into a military
confrontation between Turkey and the US]{.underline}** because American
special forces are training the Syrian Kurds in Manbij, not too far from
Afrin.

The [driving factor]{.underline} of anti-Americanism in Turkey has
traditionally been based on [conspiracy theories]{.underline}. For
decades, Turkish nationalists believed [America]{.underline} had a
[hidden agenda to support Kurdish nationalism]{.underline} in the Middle
East. Stories of American military support for the PKK - a Kurdish
separatist movement recognized as a terrorist organization by
Washington - have long circulated in Turkish nationalist circles. Such
**[rumors came to be accepted as conventional wisdom]{.underline}**.
Well, this conspiracy theory has now become reality. In the absence of a
better alternative, the YPG - the Syrian extension of the PKK - has
become America\'s main military partner on the ground in the fight
against ISIS. This, [in the eyes of Ankara, **makes its Nato ally a
supporter of terrorism**]{.underline} [and it validates]{.underline}
**[the worst conspiracies fueling anti-Americanism.]{.underline}**

While the PKK represents an existential threat for Turkey, ISIS does
not. In fact, many in Washington believe Ankara has for years turned a
blind eye to ISIS sympathizers and has actively supported Syrian jihadi
terrorist groups linked to Al Qaeda. Add to the already tense
Turkish-American blame game the issue of Fetullah Gulen, a US-based
Turkish cleric accused by Ankara of masterminding the failed coup in
2016, and you have an even more toxic mix. Erdogan is infuriated by
Washington\'s reluctance to extradite Gulen. Not surprisingly, the Gulen
affair adds an additional layer of conspiracy to arguments that
Washington was behind the failed the coup. [All these factors enable
Erdogan to]{.underline} [stoke anti-Americanism as part of his populist
nationalist **discourse to win the upcoming presidential
elections.**]{.underline}

What is striking in the anti-Kurdish and anti-American nationalist
frenzy in Turkey is the perception of Russia as a potential ally in
Syria. Erdogan and the pro-government media are remarkably silent on
Russian-Kurdish cooperation in northern Syria. No one in Turkey uttered
a word when the Russian commander at Syria\'s Hmeimim military base and
a YPG spokesman appeared before cameras to announce they were conducting
joint operations against ISIS. Russian warplanes provided air cover for
the YPG while the Kurdish forces protected Russian forces on the eastern
side of the Euphrates.

In fact, Russia\'s support of Syrian Kurds gained much more momentum in
2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet for violating its
airspace. Shortly after the incident, Moscow began delivering weapons to
the YPG in western Syria. In March last year, despite reconciliation
between Ankara and Moscow, reports surfaced that Russia was building a
military facility in Kurdish-controlled Afrin, where Russian military
advisors were to provide training to Kurdish forces. Russia has also
provided diplomatic support to the YPG. Late last year, Moscow proposed
a draft constitution for Syria that included Kurdish autonomy, and more
recently Russia decided to invite the Democratic Union Party --- the
political arm of the YPG --- to a congress of Syrian ethnic groups in
Sochi and announced the party would be included in the Astana talks.

So why is Erdogan silent on such blatant Russian-Kurdish cooperation?
[Ankara]{.underline} [appears reluctant to]{.underline}
**[alienate]{.underline}** [both Russia and the United
States]{.underline} at the same time. Erdogan probably wants to
cultivate good relations with Russia in order to gain further leverage
in relations with Washington. At a time when Russia is gaining ground in
the Middle East and Iran appears to be winning in Syria, [he clearly
believes American policymakers cannot afford to\"lose\"
Turkey]{.underline}. After all, Turkey is home to a major American
airbase as well as to Nato defense shield radars that serve to contain
Iran. These are assets [give]{.underline} **[Ankara]{.underline}** the
**[leverage]{.underline}** it needs with Washington. As usual, there is
a strong belief in Ankara than Washington needs Turkey more than Turkey
needs America.

### AT: Foreign Affairs Don't Matter Domestically

#### Foreign Affairs and Domestic Politics are [intrinsically linked]{.underline} --- the AFF is viewed as Western Powers [constraining Turkey]{.underline} 

**Ülgen 22 ---** Sinan Ülgen is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in
Brussels, where his research focuses on Turkish foreign policy, nuclear
policy, cyberpolicy, and transatlantic relations. Horizons: Journal of
International Relations and Sustainable Development , WINTER 2022, No.
20, A Cyber Odyssey: Quantum of Hope (WINTER 2022), pp. 220-229 WMK

The [third point of departure relates to the **nexus between domestic
politics and foreign policy.**]{.underline} [For a long time, foreign
policy in Turkey was viewed as being almost hermetically sealed from
domestic political considerations]{.underline}. Foreign policy
decisionmaking had been under the prevailing influence of the Foreign
Ministry, which was staffed almost exclusively by professional career
diplomats. The military was also an influential actor in areas of
strategic relevance. The political leadership had the final say, sure,
but it was essentially swayed by the calculations, assessments, and
recommendations of these two powerful, professional institutions. [Under
the AKP]{.underline}, **[the balance of power shifted to
politicians]{.underline}**---to the detriment of the institutional
players. In many ways, Turkey lurched from one extreme to the other. In
the olden days, the body politic was heavily influenced by institutional
thinking, with little interest in the domestic impact of their calculus.
In the new Turkey, the body politic wanted no institutional pressure.
[Foreign-policy-making]{.underline} disassociated itself from the
"weight" of these institutions and increasingly **[became guided and
even led by domestic political concerns.]{.underline}**

The shift away from a parliamentary system and back to a presidential
one as a result of a April 2017 constitutional referendum accentuated
these negative changes and further usurped the institutional
underpinnings of Turkish foreign policy. Decisionmaking became opaquer
and increasingly driven by a close set of presidential advisors.

As a result, [Turkish foreign policy became less predictable**, changing
its agenda in accordance with fastmoving domestic
objectives**]{.underline}. This shift was accentuated by a change in the
foreign policy rhetoric as well. [The]{.underline} [**highly-polarizing
and combative language of Turkish domestic politics** began
to]{.underline} **[permeate the country's foreign policy
discourse]{.underline}**. The public speeches of the Turkish leadership
[had made]{.underline} **[foreign countries]{.underline}** and leaders
**[just as much of a target as domestic opposition
figures]{.underline}**.

Unsurprisingly, the end result of these radical departures from the
traditional tenets of Turkish foreign policy proved to be detrimental to
Turkey's aspirations to project its prestige, influence, and power in
its neighborhood(s). In fact, Ankara became more isolated and its
relations with established partners in the West became increasingly
antagonistic.

All this finally compelled the current leadership to recalibrate its
approach to Turkish foreign policy. The rhetoric towards the United
States and the EU became less incriminating and combative. Ankara has
also undertaken de-escalation measures in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Diplomatic openings were initiated with a view to improving bilateral
relations with the region's countries including Israel, Egypt, and the
UAE---even some type of normalization with Armenia appears to be on the
horizon. It is the form and longevity of this recalibration that will
determine the future trajectory of Turkey's diplomacy.

Looking to the Next Decade

Turkey's [foreign policy inclinations]{.underline} in the next decade
will essentially be determined by how its political leadership will
decide to conceptualize the country's role as a rising power. A [major
element]{.underline} of continuity in Turkey's international relations
will therefore be its self-perception of its new role. Regardless of
whether Turkey ends up with a different constellation **[of political
leadership after the critical 2023 elections]{.underline}**, Ankara's
self-assessment of being a rising power in a multipolar world will be a
permanent fixture of Turkey's future diplomacy

As briefly examined in this essay, this identity has been interpreted
over the past decade in a way that encouraged unilateralism. [Turkish
policymakers]{.underline} intended to [demonstrate both domestically and
to outside actor]{.underline}s that the **[country had acquired the
capability to conduct an independent foreign policy.]{.underline}** The
tensions inherent to this type of accentuated unilateralism further
complicated policymaking and [undermined the traditional
alliances]{.underline} of a country already exposed to the many
instabilities stemming from the Middle East. But these tensions also
[played an important role in]{.underline} [**nurturing a domestic
narrative about Turkey's indomitable rise** and the]{.underline}
**[negative reactions of outside powers that wanted to constrain and
contain Turkey's foreign policy]{.underline}** activism and autonomy.

Although Western media likes to portray Erdogan as an Islamist
determined to destroy Ataturk\'s secularist legacy, today [the real
trend in Turkish politics is]{.underline} not Islamization but
**[nationalism driven by anti-Americanism]{.underline}** and
anti-Kurdish sentiments. [Erdogan is]{.underline} currently **[riding
this nationalist wave]{.underline}** with his military adventure in
Syria. Once again, it is [domestic dynamics of populist, **anti-American
nationalism**]{.underline} [that dictates foreign policy.]{.underline}
[Erdogan needs to **galvanize nationalism in order to stay in
power**]{.underline}. [All his calculations, in domestic and foreign
policy,]{.underline} [are above all motivated **by regime
survival**]{.underline}. [Most opinion polls show]{.underline} the Afrin
operation **[helps Erdogan\'s AKP thanks to the nationalist frenzy it
created]{.underline}**. Instead of waiting until 2019 for presidential
elections, Erdogan is therefore likely to capitalize on such dynamics
and call early elections this summer.

In short, [if you want to understand Turkey]{.underline}\'s timing in
Syria**[, look no further than Erdogan\'s domestic
agenda.]{.underline}** Finally, Erdogan needed this war because of
another **[urgent domestic problem: the economy]{.underline}**. [High
inflation, growing unemployment and diminished consumer confidence means
t]{.underline}hat **[time is not on his side]{.underline}**. Under such
circumstances, **[Erdogan doubled down on nationalist
populism]{.underline}** and launched the Afrin incursion.

The [United States also appears to be a target of Erdogan's manipulative
behavior **aimed at squeezing** concessions from other countries and
serving his own self-interests.]{.underline} When Turkish Foreign
Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken in mid-May to discuss bilateral relations, Cavusoglu presented
[Erdogan's agenda:]{.underline} "**[persuade" the United
States]{.underline}** [to follow through on the sale of F-16 fighter
jets]{.underline} to Turkey, end its support for Kurdish groups in
northern Syria, [lift the sanctions imposed on Turke]{.underline}y under
Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act, and [end the ongoing Halk Bank investigation]{.underline}.
[Erdogan's demands are rooted in his unhappiness with the Biden
administration and his inability to melt the ice between two
countrie]{.underline}s. Erdogan is particularly annoyed about the Biden
administration's refusal to end the Halk Bank investigation. Under the
Trump administration, Erdogan was allowed to exert at least some measure
of influence over the case. Erdogan, however, understands the value in
repairing relations with the United States. Doing so could create for
Erdogan the momentum needed to mend his country's relations with the
Western world. **[That momentum and mended relations, however, may not
materialize]{.underline}**. To date, the [Western world has been
**harshly critical of Erdogan's authoritarian regime**]{.underline} [and
actions such as jailing journalists and destroying democratic
constitution of the country.]{.underline} A smiling face from the
Western world, Erdogan likely knows, could boost his chances of victory
in the coming presidential elections.

## Impact

### Impact --- Draws in US

#### Turkey-Greece war [draws-in]{.underline} the US

Ted Galen **Carpenter 20**, Vice President for Defense and Foreign
Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. He received his Ph.D. in U.S.
diplomatic history from the University of Texas, "An Old NATO Nightmare
Returns: Possible War between Greece and Turkey," 9/10/20,
<https://www.cato.org/blog/old-nato-nightmare-returns-possible-war-between-greece-turkey>

[U.S. and other Western leaders have long worried about what to do if an
**armed conflict** ever **erupt**ed between two **NATO members**.
**Rapidly rising tensions** between **Greece and Turkey**, primarily
involving a maritime dispute over oil, natural gas, and other
resources]{.underline} under the eastern Mediterranean[, **have brought
that nightmare to the surface** once again]{.underline}. Germany's
Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, warned both governments in late August
against further military escalation. "[Fire is being played with and any
small spark could **lead to catastrophe**," he stressed]{.underline}.
The heart of the North Atlantic Treaty is Article 5, which proclaims
that an attack on any member of the Alliance will be considered an
attack on all. The underlying assumption is that there would then be a
collective response to repel and punish the aggressor. Obviously, that
approach would not work if two NATO signatories went to war against each
other. Even determining which country was the aggressor and which the
victim could be quite challenging. Throughout NATO's history, the
greatest risk of an intra‐​alliance conflict has always been one
involving Greece and Turkey. Although both countries joined NATO in
1952, mutual membership in that security partnership did not erase the
centuries of animosity between the two populations. Athens and Ankara
have nearly come to blows on several occasions, most notably when Turkey
invaded majority‐​Greek Cyprus in 1974, proceeded to occupy nearly 40
percent of the island, and expelled Greek Cypriots from that territory.
The occupation continues to this day. There have been several lesser,
but still worrisome, incidents over the years. Among other problems,
Turkish military planes continuously violate Greek airspace. Athens then
sends its fighter planes up to intercept and challenge the Turkish
aircraft---in some years as many as 2,000 times. Thus far, there have
been no armed clashes, but as I've written elsewhere, similar games of
aerial "chicken" involving the United States and such countries as
Russia and China are extremely reckless. One such episode between U.S.
and Chinese planes in 2001 resulted in a midair collision that killed
the Chinese pilot and created an ugly diplomatic row between Washington
and Beijing. All it would take is one miscalculation by a Greek or
Turkish pilot to trigger a similar (or worse) crisis between Athens and
Ankara. The Cyprus episode suggests what Washington's reaction would be
to the outbreak of a Greco‐​Turkish armed conflict. Under the guidance of
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the United States pressured both
countries to dampen their quarrel, and Kissinger used maximum leverage
to get the other NATO members to adopt the same position. However,
Kissinger's stance was far from neutral. Even though Turkey had been the
aggressor, the \[US\] United States soon tilted in favor of Ankara's
position. Congressional anger compelled Gerald Ford's administration to
implement sanctions against the Turkish government, but the White House
moved inexorably to dilute those measures as quickly as possible. That
approach continued under Jimmy Carter's administration, and by the
beginning of the 1980s, the restrictions were effectively moot.
Washington's response reflected the belief that Turkey was a much more
important ally than Greece in terms of strategic considerations. There
is little reason to believe that the U.S. attitude has changed. Even if
a Biden administration would not share Donald Trump's apparent
admiration for Turkey's autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both
security and economic calculations would push Washington toward that
conclusion. There is one important difference, though, between the
Cyprus crisis and a possible new confrontation between Athens and
Ankara. Key NATO powers, most notably France and Italy, are not happy
about Erdogan's increasingly undemocratic rule and his government's
maverick, often pro‐​Russian, behavior on security issues. In addition,
France has openly challenged Turkey's territorial and resource claims in
the eastern Mediterranean, and in late August, French warships and
planes joined a joint military exercise with Greece and Cyprus to convey
a blunt message of displeasure to Ankara. Washington may find it far
more difficult today to drag its NATO allies into taking a pro‐​Turkish
stance in case of an armed confrontation between Greece and Turkey than
it did in 1974. [The mere prospect of a possible **Greco‐​Turkish war
underscores** one of the major drawbacks of the United States being the
leader of a nearly 30‐​member military **alliance**. America
automatically is **entangled** in the grievances and quarrels of every
one of those members]{.underline}. And when two members openly hate each
other, that situation can create not only a headache but an outright
nightmare for the United States.

#### Turkey-Greece war escalates and the US gets drawn-in

**Stratfor 20**, Shadow CIA, iykyk, "What\'s Driving Turkish Aggression
in the Mediterranean Sea," 9/9/20,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/whats-driving-turkish-aggression-mediterranean-sea>

[Turkey is putting its 50-year view on maritime rights into practice
through its **Blue Homeland** Doctrine, growing its naval and commercial
presence in Mediterranean waters that it claims are part of its
exclusive economic zones]{.underline} (EEZs). Oil and gas exploration is
becoming a crucial tool in implementing this strategy. [But Ankara\'s
attempts to claim extensive maritime resource rights risk broadening to
a **wider conflict with Greece and** other **NATO allies** that would
bring foreign energy projects, and potentially the United States, into
the fray]{.underline}. Turkey\'s Maritime Ambitions Turkey claims that
all of its neighboring waters in the Aegean, Black and Mediterranean
seas deserve special treatment under international law, and that the
islands in the Aegean Sea (which Greece controls the majority of) should
not enjoy the same rights as large countries like Turkey with lengthy
coastlines. The international community never adopted these
distinctions, which is why Turkey is not a signatory to the United
Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and prefers to
resolve disputes through bilateral negotiations in lieu of not
international arbitration. This has so far led to two major disputes
with Greece in the Aegean and Mediterranean seas, as well as a major
dispute with Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey\'s most
important dispute is in the Aegean Sea, where thousands of Greek islands
help boost Greece\'s maritime claims over Turkey\'s, and where the two
countries disagree on how to even start drawing a maritime border due to
the disparity in the number of islands between them. Turkey has just
three islands in the Aegean Sea, while Greece claims more than 3,000.
Given the higher number of Greek islands, Turkey has long maintained
that any expansion of Greek maritime claims from six nautical miles (nm)
to 12 nm off Greece\'s shores would constitute a \"casus belli,\" or
cause of war. While Greece and Turkey have nearly gone to war several
times over disputes in the Aegean Sea, the two countries have so far
avoided declaring full EEZs in the region, as well as claiming
territorial waters beyond six nautical miles. But that doesn\'t mean
they can\'t do so in the future. Ankara has argued that if both Greece
and Turkey extended their claims beyond 12 nm, Turkey\'s percent
ownership of the territory would only marginally increase, while Greece
would see its territorial control reach nearly three-quarters of the
entire Aegean Sea. The use of Greece\'s islands in the Aegean Sea to
demarcate a maritime border for EEZs, which extend up to 200 nm from the
coast, would also leave Turkey with virtually no rights to the natural
resources and fisheries in the Aegean Sea. Turkey has argued that a more
equitable way to split the sea\'s resources would be by ignoring the
islands altogether and starting off with an equidistant line between the
Greek and Turkish mainlands. Ankara Takes Action [By more **aggressively
flexing its claims** through energy exploration and naval exercises in
the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey is trying to both **legitimize its**
declared **EEZ** claim, as well as delegitimize any potential EEZ claims
in the region that Greece has through its islands of Crete, Rhodes and
Kastellorizo]{.underline}. Kastellorizo, in particular, has the
potential to generate a significant EEZ claim for Greece that could
connect to Cyprus\'s own claimed EEZ, thus significantly limiting
Turkish claims to resources between Crete and Cyprus. [Further
escalation could result in Greece finally claiming its full EEZ in the
eastern Mediterranean, which Athens has so far been reluctant to do for
fear of spurring a wider **conflict**]{.underline}. Protected by a
Turkish naval convoy, Turkey\'s Oruc Reis surveying vessel has been
active throughout the Mediterranean Sea since the beginning of the year.
Turkey\'s December 2019 maritime agreement with Libya\'s Government of
National Accord aims to legitimize Turkey\'s claims by establishing a
border between Turkish and Libyan waters that ignores Crete and
Kastellorizo. On Aug. 27, the Greek parliament ratified a maritime
border agreement with Egypt aimed at countering Turkey\'s pact with
Libya by legitimizing a potential EEZ border generated via its control
of Crete with Egypt. Greece\'s deal with Egypt is a first step in
potentially declaring a full EEZ in the eastern Mediterranean, but the
agreement with Egypt does not legitimize potential claims that
Kastellorizo could give Greece rights to. [Turkey has also been actively
attempting to **delegitimize Cyprus\'** claimed **EEZ** in the eastern
Mediterranean by both conducting energy exploration in waters that
Cyprus directly claims, as well as harassing foreign companies that are
operating on behalf of the Cypriot government]{.underline}. Turkey has
argued that Cyprus\' claimed EEZ is not legal because it was not done in
coordination with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which Ankara
recognizes as a legitimate government for all of Cyprus. Turkey also
argues that, as an island, Cyprus cannot claim a full EEZ. Turkey\'s
Yavuz vessel is currently drilling off the coast of Western Cyprus.
Turkey\'s Barbados vessel is also currently researching in the Northern
Cyprus territorial waters that Turkey recognizes as a part of an oil
exploration block held by the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corporation.
In 2018, the Turkish navy prevented the Italian oil firm Eni from
drilling on its Cuttlefish prospect in an exploration block the company
received from Cyprus. The Specter of War [Turkey\'s increased
provocations will continue to drive the United States and other NATO
countries, including France and Greece, to boost their own naval
**presence** in the eastern Mediterranean]{.underline}. Both Turkey and
Greece will try to refrain from crossing red lines that could spur a
larger confrontation that neither wants, but the higher presence of
ships in the eastern Mediterranean will nonetheless increase the
possibility of incidents, as evidenced by the Aug. 10 collision between
the Greek frigate Limnos and the Turkish frigate Kemal Reis.
International mediation would likely avoid further escalation to a
military conflict between Greece and Turkey, but is unlikely to result
in a diplomatic solution to their dispute. [In the case of a wider
**crisis**, most NATO members would view Turkey as the aggressor and
would likely **back Greece**. This would likely reinforce Ankara\'s
overall pursuit of its **maritime strategy** and intensifying national
security push by offering Turkey further proof that NATO does not
prioritize its national security priorities]{.underline}. Countries can
only leave NATO on their own accord, which Turkey remains is unlikely to
do. [Instead, Ankara would probably continue to **reduce collaboration
with NATO** countries]{.underline}. Despite Cyprus and Greece\'s calls
for a more significant response to deter Turkey\'s behavior, the
European Union will likely be hesitant to impose more drastic measures
for fear of prompting Ankara to reduce cooperation on migration and
other EU priorities. Unless Turkey starts to more directly protect its
claims in the Aegean Sea, fires upon a Greek or another European vessel,
or conducts drilling or exploration activities around Crete, Brussels
will likely limit its sanctions pressure to companies and individuals
supporting Turkish activities in the Mediterranean. Decisions on
implementing EU sanctions require unanimity among the bloc\'s member
states. And some countries, such as Germany, are more concerned about
aggressive sanctions only inflaming Brussels\' tensions with Turkey. If
the European Union does not take significant action on Turkey, Cyprus is
now threatening to veto proposed EU sanctions against Belarus amid the
country\'s ongoing political crisis. This may result in slightly
stronger EU sanctions that target more Turkish individuals and
companies, but more broad-based economic sanctions against the Turkish
government remain unlikely. Energy Projects in the Crossfire [The United
States will likely let the European Union continue to take the lead in
responding to Turkey\'s attempts to delegitimize Greek and Cypriot
maritime claims, but Chevron\'s recent entry into the eastern
Mediterranean could eventually **draw Washington** more directly
**in**to the conflict]{.underline}. On July 20, Chevron announced an
agreement to acquire the Houston-based oil and gas firm Noble Energy,
which operates both the Leviathan gas field off the coast of Israel and
the Aphrodite gas field off the coast of Cyprus. Ankara, however, will
likely adopt a more hands-off approach to U.S. companies operating in
the region, as the United States would be more willing to impose
hardline sanctions in response to American firms being drawn into its
maritime disputes. By continuing to increase the cost of developing
resources in Cypriot waters, Turkey\'s ongoing harassment of foreign
energy firms will drive its neighbors closer together on both maritime
security and energy exploration issues. [But it could also
**potentially** halt their construction of the proposed East Med
pipeline.]{.underline} Cyprus, Egypt, Greece and Israel created the East
Mediterranean Gas Forum in 2019. The quartet has since collaborated to
construct the roughly \$6 billion pipeline project, which would carry
natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. Under
international law, Turkey is technically required to allow other
countries to build pipelines through its EEZ. But Ankara retains the
power to demand that any constructors of the East Med pipeline adhere to
its environmental reviews and oversight, which would be de facto
recognition of Turkey\'s EEZ. Otherwise, Turkey could send its navy to
harass or intercept vessels involved with construction as Ankara did in
2018 with a drillship planning to spud a well in Cypriot waters.

### Turns Case --- Cohesion

#### Even if it doesn't escalate it [destroys]{.underline} NATO cohesion

**Salacanin 20 ---** Stasa Salacanin, Author for Inside Arabia.
10/21/2020. "NATO's Dilemma Over Greece-Turkey Friction", Inside Arabia,
https://insidearabia.com/natos-dilemma-over-greece-turkey-friction/ WMK

[Tensions between Turkey and Greece have increased]{.underline} after
**[a series of disputes]{.underline}** over the interpretation of
[international maritime law and territorial waters]{.underline} in the
Eastern Mediterranean, [where rich gas deposits have been
found.]{.underline} Last month, Greek and Turkish military ships
collided in contested waters near the Greek island of Kastellorizo,
which lies just 2 km (1.2 miles) from the Turkish coast. Turkish
military vessels guarded the country's seismic research ship. This
[flexing of military muscles]{.underline} has **[raised concerns of
confrontation]{.underline}** [between the two NATO members, who share a
long history of disputes.]{.underline}

In short, while Greece has insisted that a country's continental shelf
should be measured from islands that belong to a particular state -- an
interpretation that has been supported by the UN Law of the Sea --Turkey
builds its case by claiming that a nation's continental shelf should be
measured from its mainland coast.

Turkey's exploration of the Mediterranean for hydrocarbons has pushed it
at loggerheads over energy resources with many other countries in the
region. Ankara has been criticized for its foreign and security
policies, which have often been seen as incompatible with the interests
of NATO members. Many analysts suggest that one of the main causes for
the current discord with Turkey lies in Ankara's implementation of the
Blue Homeland Doctrine developed over 15 years ago, that seeks to expand
Turkey's influence in the Mediterranean as well as the Black Sea, and to
exploit energy and other resources.

The disagreement grew when Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt in
August, to counter Ankara's agreement with the Tripoli-based Government
of National Accord, which defines the maritime border between Turkey and
Libya, and permits Turkey to jointly exploit energy sources in the
Mediterranean. The accord has triggered a series of incidents in the
Mediterranean, adding to the list of Turkey's unilateral moves in Syria
and Libya as well as the decision to buy Russian S-400, and pushing
Ankara in serious odds with NATO and the EU.

[NATO has tried to de-escalate the situation.]{.underline} Its Chief,
Jens Stoltenberg, [encouraged the Greek and Turkish sides to engage in
dialogue]{.underline}, along with Germany and the US---two influential
NATO members seeking to take a mediator role in the dispute. The EU,
however, explicitly threatened Turkey with sanctions if it continues
with its unilateral drilling activities and aggressive moves.

Although NATO has never been designed to adjudicate disputes between its
members, [the alliance has developed some basic deconfliction
arrangements]{.underline}, such as minimum distances between aircrafts
and ships and the establishment of hotlines.

The [later]{.underline} has been [set up as a military mechanism to
prevent serious clashes following talks between Turkey and Greece at the
NATO headquarters in Brussels.]{.underline} The hotline will enable
direct communication between the two sides, similar to one that was
installed during the Cold War between Moscow and Washington.

Whil[e current initiatives may calm the brewing tension in the short
run, it is obvious that]{.underline} **[NATO faces much deeper dilemmas,
which seriously undermine its cohesion]{.underline}**.

According to Barah Mikaïl, Founding Director of Stractegia -- a
Madrid-based consultancy specializing in Middle Eastern geopolitics,
this is why NATO's Secretary-General is trying to mediate between the
two countries. "NATO -- and most of its members -- know that they need
to calm things down if they want to maintain NATO's image of cohesion.
They also know that Turkey is an important military, geographic, and
strategic partner, and that if they don't handle all this with care,
they could be facing a fierce and aggressive reaction from Turkey," he
told Inside Arabia.

It seems that [Turkey is]{.underline} trying to write a new set of rules
while **[testing the patience of the alliance]{.underline}**, [knowing
that it is an important geostrategic member of NATO.]{.underline} On the
other hand, Tarik Basbugoglu, a PhD candidate at Glasgow Caledonian
University in Scotland and an expert on Turkey's foreign policy,
explained that although Turkey does not want to leave NATO, it has been
disappointed over the lack of understanding and solidarity it received
regarding the Gulenist military coup, Turkish military operations in
Syria against Syrian Kurds, and Turkish policy in the broader MENA
region.

In Mikaïl's view, Turkey is trying to get the maximum benefit before it
takes a break and considers negotiations, recognizing that it is in a
position of power. "It did so in Libya; it tried to do so in Syria; it
is pushing in the same way on Nagorno Karabakh---of course,
Ankara/Erdogan could always push things beyond some red lines and create
a risk zone, but Turks also know where to stop," Mikaïl explained. "And
they know how to pressure NATO in order to get what they want, and to
make themselves feared and taken \[seriously\]," he added.

Nevertheless, it seems that [NATO has become]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~
\[[immobilized]{.underline}\] **[over the Turkey-Greece]{.underline}**
issue---two nominal allies that have never been very friendly.

Basbugoglu observes that although the Trump administration seemed to be
neutral towards the recent Turkish-Greek tensions, US Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo went to Cyprus and Greece to calm down both sides. He
recalls that Pompeo warned the Turkish government to not escalate the
friction by sending the Oruc Reis survey vessel to the East
Mediterranean during his Cyprus visit.

Yet, Basbugoglu noted, the US Embassy in Turkey expressed its support to
Ankara by saying that the US did not accept the Sevilla map which
increases the maritime border zones of Greece. Therefore, according to
Basbugoglu, "the Trump leadership sought to play a constructive role in
decreasing the tensions in the East Mediterranean."

However, in Mikaïl's opinion, [it is impossible to broker between Greece
and Turkey without taking sid]{.underline}es, as their demands are
diametrically opposed. "This is why an 'external' mediation may be
needed, but **[there is not much NATO can do since it also cares about
keeping in its ranks a country]{.underline}** \[Turkey\] that is
essential for both its military and geographic projection -- especially
towards Russia, the endless raison d'être for NATO," he added.

Moreover, by being overly obsessed with Russia and focusing primarily on
its eastern flank, NATO has long neglected its southern flank that is
highly vulnerable and exposed to the destructive impact of Middle
Eastern conflicts and growing tensions among its members.

Furthermore, in the absence of firm leadership, [NATO has **not been
able to respond to the particular interests of some of its larger
members**]{.underline}. Thus countries like [Turkey often pursued their
own geopolitical tactics **which collided with the aims of other members
of the alliance,**]{.underline} [causing frictions that]{.underline}
**[seriously undermine the stability and very foundation of the
organization.]{.underline}**

Turkish obstructionism against Swedish and Finnish NATO membership, its
limited offensive in Iraq, and its prospective offensive in Syria have
grabbed international attention. But [more significant is Turkey's
growing diplomatic tension]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
**[Greece]{.underline}**, [an ever-festering lesion]{.underline} **[that
threatens to burst.]{.underline}**

[Considering Turkey's]{.underline} **[domestic situation]{.underline}**
and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [the United States must be
wary.]{.underline} Turkish President Recip Tayyip [Erdogan could
capitalize on]{.underline} [**international distraction and wage a
diversionary war** to boost his popularity**, a conflict that would
disrupt NATO's cohesion and threaten the alliance.**]{.underline}

Washington should act now to resolve the current incarnation of this
long-standing Mediterranean dispute.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics since 2001, when his
AKP party first won a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Although
Erdogan was banned from Turkish politics for anti-secular incitement,
his prime ministerial --- and, later, presidential --- predecessor,
Abdullah Gül, until the mid-2010s at least, was functionally a stand-in
for him. Erdogan may have restricted his Islamist proclivities and
international assertiveness until he consolidated power in 2014-2016.
However, Turkey's break with the United States over the latter's
invasion of Iraq, and Turkey's growing hostility towards Israel,
indicated a deeper rift between Washington and Ankara. Erdogan
consistently sought a greater regional role; through diplomatic pressure
against Israel culminating with the Gaza Flotilla --- a bald-faced
attempt to prompt a confrontation with Israel --- Erdogan hoped to
position himself as the spiritual leader of the Islamic world.

The Arab Spring, however, transformed the regional balance. No power
could pretend that the "Palestine Question" still defined regional
politics. The Libyan and Syrian civil wars, and the subsequent rise of
ISIS, thrust Islamism to the fore once again, while Iranian expansion in
Iraq, Syria and Lebanon demonstrated the relevance of traditional
coalition competition, rather than religious rivalry.

Turkey's response has been to sharpen its shift away from the United
States by alternating between Russophilic and Russophobic policies.

The Levantine maelstrom that began in Syria and exploded in Iraq stoked
Turkish fears of Kurdish revanchism. Even before that, Russian presence
in Syria prompted Turkey to pursue a more aggressive policy, supporting
Islamist elements in the Syrian opposition and destroying a Russian
Su-24 that briefly violated Turkish airspace. Two years later, Turkey
agreed to purchase S-400 anti-air systems from Russia that, in 2019,
prompted its ejection from the West's F-35 fighter-jet program and U.S.
sanctions.

More generally, Turkey asserted itself militarily since 2016,
intervening directly in Syria and Libya. In the latter conflict, Turkey
aligned with the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, opposing
the Tobruk-based French-, Russian-, Emirati- and Egyptian-supported
House of Representatives. Although fighting there has subsided, tensions
may again explode --- and by striking a territorial deal in Libya,
Turkey can lay claims to the Eastern Mediterranean's natural gas
deposits, threatening Israel, Egypt and Greece.

Turkish actions during the Ukraine war have indicated Ankara's desire to
return to the Western fold. Initially, Turkey refrained from engaging,
likely seeking to determine if Ukraine would collapse within days.
However, three days into the war, when it became apparent Ukraine would
resist, Turkey closed the Bosphorus Straits to Russia; Russian Black Sea
Fleet warships in the Levantine Basin can still return to their home
port in Sevastopol, but their inability to sortie from Sevastopol into
the Mediterranean will disrupt Russian outer naval defenses in the
long-term.

Turkey also attempted to position itself as a mediator between Kyiv and
Moscow, and it spearheaded a half-hearted attempt (albeit with great
public fanfare) to ensure grain exports from Ukraine.

Yet, Turkey's resistance to Swedish and Finnish NATO memberships is a
ploy to extract concessions from Washington: If the Biden administration
reinstates Turkey in the F-35 program and approves F-16 sales, Erdogan
likely will relent.

Buying Turkish acquiescence is no way to ensure a long-term strategic
partnership, however. Indeed, [Erdogan is laying the groundwork for
**another Greco-Turkish confrontation.**]{.underline}

The focal point, once again, is Cyprus. Gree[ce and Cyprus are linked by
ethno-linguistic ties, political history and strategic
interest.]{.underline} If Crete "caps" the Aegean, [Cyprus provides
Greece a pressure point against any Anatolian or Near Eastern power that
would threaten it.]{.underline} Greece maintains a small military force
in Cyprus, is a supplier to Cyprus' small National Guard, and is a
crucial Cypriot trading partner. However, in 1974, Turkey invaded
Cyprus, capturing a third of the island and collapsing the Greek
military junta that had organized a coup in Cyprus earlier that year.
Turkey has not annexed Cyprus outright, instead establishing a satellite
state on the island's north that only Ankara recognizes. The current
situation is tenable, although Turkey has used Northern Cyprus to
tacitly extend its presence in the Levantine Basin.

Turkey's agreement with Libya solidified its claims to the Eastern
Mediterranean's petrochemicals. With the Libyan civil war's apparent
conclusion, and Turkey's desire to return to the Western camp, [Erdogan
might be expected to refrain from spoiling Greco-Turkish relations with
moves in Cyprus or elsewhere]{.underline} --- **[but he has done the
opposite.]{.underline}** [Turkey has struck a major economic
deal]{.underline} with Northern Cyprus [that would increase Ankara's
direct leverage over the statelet]{.underline}; it would list Ercan
airport, Northern Cyprus's international aerial hub, as a domestic
destination on Turkish flights. [Cypriot authorities fear this is the
**first step towards outright annexation,**]{.underline} [which
would]{.underline} **[shatter a UN-brokered ceasefire and undoubtedly
prompt a Greek military response.]{.underline}** [Erdogan has also
leveled threats over]{.underline} **[Greece's alleged militarization of
Aegean islands,]{.underline}** despite Greece's long-standing military
presence in the Aegean.

In turn, an [escalating economic crisis is ravaging Turkey]{.underline}.
Food and energy supply disruptions have sharpened inflationary pressures
with which Turkey has grappled since 2017. Erdogan's refusal to increase
interest rates and tighten the money supply is an advanced form of
macro-economic foolishness; in 2021, the Turkish lira's value was
slashed by half. Yet inflation remains at 60-plus percent and is likely
to climb.

[Erdogan's AKP lost ground in nearly all major cities]{.underline} in
the 2019 local elections. As the 2023 parliamentary and presidential
elections approach, [Erdogan may seek to **distract domestic attention
with a major foreign policy crisis, such as a confrontation with
Greece.**]{.underline}

#### Erdogan starts a war with Greece if there is [voter backlash]{.underline} to his policies

Greece and mobilizes Imams in his re-election bid,\" ThePrint,

accessed 6-25-2022, WMK

[As Turkey is facing a serious economic crisis, Erdogan, seeing his
popularity falling rapidly in repeated opinion polls,]{.underline} [is
trying to win votes]{.underline} by **[escalating his rhetoric against
Greece]{.underline}** and by mobilizing the big network of imams to
persuade Turkish expatriates to vote for him.

Speaking after watching military exercises in Izmir, on the same day he
confirmed that he will run in the June 2023 elections,
[Erdogan]{.underline} **[increased tensions]{.underline}** with
Turkey\'s neighbour Greece, [warning Athens]{.underline} **[to stop
arming Aegean islands]{.underline}** that do not have a military status.

In Turkey\'s view, the Aegean islands were given to Greece under the
1923 Lausanne Treaty and the 1947 Paris Treaty on the condition that
they would not be armed. [Ankara accuses Greece of having military units
and weapons systems]{.underline} mainly on the Dodecanese islands in
East Aegean.

\"I warn Greece to avoid dreams, acts and statements that will result in
regret. Come to your senses, \" Erdogan said and added that Turkey will
not renounce its rights in the Aegean and will not back down from using
rights that are established by international agreements when it comes to
arming islands.\"

Erdogan\'s coalition partner and leader of the ultra-nationalist MHP
Party Devlet Bahceli also [accused Greece]{.underline} **[of escalating
tensions]{.underline}** and said that **[the Greeks are playing with
fire.]{.underline}**

\"The question of the Dodecanese islands, which is the continuation of
Anatolia, is a wound that has not yet closed,\" declared Bahceli and
ominously added: \"The stolen items must be returned to the owner,
whether voluntarily or by force.\"

Furthermore, Bahceli claimed that the nine military bases that the US
has set up in Greece are a threat to Turkey\'s national identity.
\"Greece\'s request for F-15 and F-16 aircraft from the US is not an
invitation to peace, but to polarization, \" he said.

The response of the Greek Government is that Turkey deliberately
misinterprets the treaties regarding armed forces on these Greek islands
and insists that it has legal grounds to defend itself in the face of
Ankara\'s hostile actions.

[Ankara has recently launched a **barrage of violations** of Greek
airspace]{.underline}. Greek aircraft always identify and intercept the
Turkish fighter jets.

It is noted that [in]{.underline} the summer of [2020]{.underline}, the
ongoing [dispute]{.underline} between Athens and Ankara over significant
gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean [**almost led to a military
conflict** after Turkish research ships had been crossing Greek waters
for many days.]{.underline}

[Erdogan]{.underline} in the past few weeks **[has kept lashing out at
Greece]{.underline}**, trying to \"put it in its place\", [threatening
it with **severe consequences**.]{.underline} He does this because, on
the one hand, he sees Athens as a soft and easy target, and, on the
other, he increases tensions with NATO ally Greece as a leverage on the
United States regarding his plans to invade northern Syria and to get
recognition of his demands on the energy resources of Eastern
Mediterranean.

The [Turkish President]{.underline} and his ultra-nationalist ally
Bahceli [have seen their **popularity falling**]{.underline} in opinion
polls [and fear a]{.underline} **[voter backlash]{.underline}**, [as
Turkey\'s inflation keeps soaring at 73 per cent]{.underline}, while
energy and food prices are reaching unprecedented heights, unemployment
keeps rising and the value of the Turkish Lira is declining rapidly.

That is why on March 31, the Turkish Parliament, where Erdogan\'s AKP
and Bahceli MHP currently control the majority, voted to lower the
election threshold from 10 to 7 per cent, because polls showed that MHP
will remain under the 10 required per cent threshold in a possible
election.

[Erdogan is]{.underline} also [greatly worried about the declining
popularity of his own party AKP,]{.underline} because the [latest
opinion polls show that the support it enjoys]{.underline} has [fallen
to 27.7 per cent]{.underline}, from the 42.6 per cent it scored in the
2018 elections. So, [Erdogan needs]{.underline} **[every single
vote]{.underline}** [he can get]{.underline} to narrow the gap with the
opposition parties.

#### Erdogan uses Greece as a diversionary target

[Facing presidential and parliamentary elections next June, it is
essentially Erdogan's future that hangs in the balance, not to speak of
Turkey's]{.underline}. Sagging behind in the polls, Erdogan faces defeat
from two of his rivals, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the CHP
(Republican People's Party), Atatürk's old party, and Ekrem Imamoglu,
the mayor of Istanbul. It was Imamoglu who three years ago defeated the
AKP's candidate in a re-run of the mayoral election, engineered by
Erdogan. Now an attempt is being made to nobble Imamoglu's candidacy
with a charge of "insult," carrying a four-year jail sentence. [Ten
years ago, Erdogan declared it was the government's intention to raise
"a pious generation," but already the following year his plan
backfired]{.underline} with the Gezi Park protests, which spread to most
of Turkey. Therefore, it must come as a disappointment that more than
half of Turkey's first-time voters have declared they will never vote
for him. The overriding issue for most Turkish voters is the economy,
which in the view of former Turkish economy minister, Ali Babacan, is on
the verge of bankruptcy. The Turkish lira is in free fall and raging
inflation, which in May reached 73 percent, has left 90 percent of the
population struggling to make ends meet. As the Bipartisan Policy Center
earlier pointed out, [Erdogan]{.underline} relied on the narrative of a
booming economy for electoral success but now he [is facing the
backlash]{.underline}. Russian economist Sergei Gurlev writes of a
similar pattern in Putin's Russia, when Russia's GDP growth slowed to
almost zero and Vladimir Putin's approval ratings dropped. According to
Gurlev, [Putin decided to address an economic problem with a
non-economic solution, the annexation of Crimea, which boosted his
popularity]{.underline}. [Erdogan has followed the same
recipe]{.underline}. For example, when **[Turkey invaded and occupied
Afrin]{.underline}**, a Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria, in 2018,
it gained him support from almost 90 percent of the electorate. [Now he
is playing the same card again]{.underline}, using security concerns to
justify a new incursion into northern Syria and block Finland and
Sweden's NATO membership. A "special operation" **[targeting Greece's
Aegean islands would also be grist to Erdogan's mill]{.underline}**.

There has never been any love lost between Turkey and Greece, but [the
danger of war between the two NATO members]{.underline} **[has not been
this high since the Cyprus conflict more than forty-five years
ago]{.underline}**. In the past, Turkey and Greece have gone to the
brink, but [policies initiated by]{.underline} Turkish President Recep
Tayyip [Erdoğan]{.underline} **[may very much push the two neighbors
over the edge.]{.underline}**

Greek and Turkish fighter jets engaged in mock dogfights this week over
the Greek island of Kastellorizo, just a mile and a half from the
Turkish coast, causing tourists to flee. Meanwhile, there is a [growing
risk]{.underline} that the Turkish and Greek [navies will
clash,]{.underline} hundreds of miles to the west if [Turkey **pushes
forward** with its plans to survey for has in Greece's exclusive
economic zone]{.underline}. Greek officials say that all options are on
the table, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has rushed to mediate as
U.S. officials remain largely absent.

### AT: Other Divisionary War Scenarios

#### War against Greece is the [most likely scenario]{.underline} for diversion 

**Atlamazoglou 21 ---** Atlamazoglou, Defense journalist specializing in
special operations, a Hellenic Army, and a Johns Hopkins University
graduate. "What A War Between Greece And Turkey Would Look Like" October

WMK

A conflict between Greece and Turkey could spark in several
different---intentional and accidental---ways. The two [countries could
go to war over]{.underline} an islet dispute---of which there are
hundreds in the Aegean Sea, which borders the two countries---after an
escalation following an air or naval accident---there have been several
over the years---or in [an attempt]{.underline} **[to placate domestic
unrest]{.underline}**---[in]{.underline} the case of
**[Turkey]{.underline}**.

It's important to note that in all of the above scenarios, **[Turkey
would be the aggressor.]{.underline}** Contrary to Ankara, [Athens has
no revisionist or expansionist aspirations]{.underline}. Greece doesn't
weaponize illegal immigrants to pressure Turkey into concessions. Greece
doesn't violate Turkey's air space with armed fighter jets multiple
times a day. Greece doesn't send survey ships, accompanied by warships,
in the exclusive economic zones of other countries.

Ruling a country with approximately 83 million people and a gross
domestic product of close to \$800 billion, Erdogan [sees
Greece]{.underline}, which has a population of 10 million and about
\$210 billion GDP, as a small nuisance. But a [nuisance that is standing
between Ankara's ambition to expand its influence]{.underline} in the
Mediterranean, Middle East, and Africa.

With the Turkish economy in a free fall without a parachute, [Erdogan
might try to]{.underline} **[appease domestic displeasure and unrest
with foreign adventures]{.underline}**. [With his numbers
falling,]{.underline} **[Erdogan might try to do something before the
2023 elections]{.underline}**.

The [AKP government]{.underline} continued to **[manipulate the
country's foreign policy]{.underline}** [through]{.underline}
**[military operations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[escalated
tension]{.underline}** [with foreign countries to]{.underline}
**[contain domestic opposition]{.underline}**, [especially]{.underline}
(as noted in Figure 1) **[prior to elections or whenever the approval
rating of the government declined]{.underline}**.46 A [series of
incidents and dog fights between]{.underline} the **[Turkish and Greek
warplanes]{.underline}** in April 2018 [before the snap
elections]{.underline} in June is **[an example of these
policies]{.underline}**.47 [Turkey's traditional competition with
Greece]{.underline} and the RoC [was periodically used to increase
**tension and mobilize the nationalist base**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[distract people's attention from problems at
home.]{.underline}**48 During this episode with Greece and the RoC,
Bahçeli and Erdoğan submitted another joint proposal to move the
elections forward (originally scheduled to be held in November 2019),
and on June 24th, the presidential election and parliamentary elections
were held on the same day. Although the AKP failed to secure the
necessary majority of 300 deputies in the election, its alliance with
the MHP gained 342 out of 600 seats. Interestingly, the new system was
designed to reduce the possibility of coalitions to ensure that
coalition governments were not able to return decades of instability.
However, the AKP failed to obtain the 300 deputies needed for the
majority of the seats in the first general election of this new system.
Therefore, it had no choice but to continue cooperating with the MHP.
Hale points out that in the American presidential system, if a president
lacks the majority in Congress, then a 'log-rolling' method is utilized,
which requires compromise and individual persuasion.49 Under the new
presidential system, the AKP adopted a log-rolling strategy to maintain
its parliamentary majority. The AKP gained the MHP's support after the
failed coup attempt, but following the June 2018 election, it became
dependent on the MHP's support in the National Assembly. Along with the
mobilization strategy, the AKP also adopted insulation and accommodation
strategies against its ostensible ally. The AKP-MHP alliance is a
nationalistic partnership, and it is based on the creation of external
problems and military engagement abroad like the 'forever war' where
conflicts constantly remain in the political background. Neack describes
this as Hagan's 'insulation strategy with a twist' where the coalition
of elites wants to stay in power by creating 'an external situation that
diverts attention from them, insulating them from critical domestic
opponents and popular demands.' 50 The MHP exerted a greater influence
on Turkish politics as the AKP needed its help to pass legislation.
Thus, the alliance empowered the MHP to actively participate in the
country's foreign policymaking process. However, this alliance has been
faced with challenges and a clash of interests. The MHP proposed a
partial amnesty law in May 2018, but the AKP chose to insulate the MHP
by overriding this request and rejected the proposal (this was before
the election in June and the AKP's dependency on the MHP). The Student
Oath issue became another divisive problem between the AKP-MHP
partnership that led the MHP to suspend the People's Alliance during the
local elections in March 2019. Bahçeli announced that his party would
not use the alliance to propose joint candidates. Later, he agreed not
to nominate any candidate for big cities and announced his party's
support for the AKP's candidate in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. This
example illustrates how the AKP utilized an insulation strategy along
with a mobilization strategy where policymaking elites gained support
for their policies, but also coopted the MHP to achieve a dual agenda of
staying at power and building a coalition. At this point, insulation and
mobilization strategies were entwined, making it difficult to indicate
where insulation ends and mobilization begins. Neack's statement of
'insulation with a twist' points out the complexity and difficulty of
implicitly separating these two strategies from each other. In February
and March 2019, the TAF launched the 'Blue Homeland' naval exercise
simultaneously in the Black Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean. This
action allowed the AKP-MHP coalition to pursue coercive policies and
gunboat diplomacy against Greece, but was also intended to regain
domestic support to achieve their policy objectives. The word 'homeland'
has a strong meaning for the Turkish population, which is oversensitive
about national sovereignty, especially due to the failed coup attempt.
Military training was also held a few weeks before the 2019 local
elections. However, despite the MHP's support and naval training that
appealed to nationalists, the AKP lost to CHP candidates in all of the
big cities. In response, the AKP applied to the Supreme Electoral
Council to annul election in Istanbul, while also launching a
cross-border military operation, 'Operation Claw', in Northern Iraq
against Kurdish separatists before the June 23rd re-run election
election in Istanbul, which was similar to its 2015 general re-election
strategy. In addition, in May, the government also announced that
Turkish ships would drill for natural gas off the southern coast of the
RoC and sent two drill ships that were accompanied by Turkish naval
frigates and three gunboats.51 Nevertheless, this mobilization strategy
and manipulation of Turkish foreign policy in the Eastern Mediterranean
and cross-border operations in Iraq failed to bring the desired result.
The CHP's candidate, Ekrem İmamoğlu won again by increasing his margin
from 13,000 to nearly 775,000 votes.52 The CHP's victory in Istanbul
demonstrated declining support for the AKP's policies and ended the
25-year rule of Erdoğan in Istanbul. Despite this failure, [it is clear
that Turkey's **cross-border operations** to address security concerns
and **assertive policies**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} **[Eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}** [correlate with]{.underline}
**[general/local election dates.]{.underline}** [Therefore, the timing
of these policies]{.underline}/operations **[further strengthens
suspicions that the AKP]{.underline}**MHP alliance in**[tentionally
exploits and manipulates Turkey's national security]{.underline}** and
national inter[est related issues to suppress and prevail over
**domestic opposition. Economic problems**]{.underline} ha[ve become the
most important]{.underline} **[domestic challenge to the
AKP]{.underline}**. The Turkish lira (TL) has dramatically lost value,
falling against the US dollar from 4.70 on July 2018--18.05 by December
2021. Weak institutions, declining rule of law, growing political
influence over the judiciary, and failed monetary policies have
negatively affected foreign direct investments (FDI) in Turkey.
According to the World Investment Report, FDI inflow to Turkey was
reported at \$19 billion in 2015, fell to \$13.5 billion in 2016, \$11
billion in 2017, and dropped to \$9.2 billion in 2019.53 The failed coup
attempt, political instability, deepening problems with the West over
the Kurdish issue, and the snap elections in 2018 contributed to
declining FDI inflows and Turkish economic performance. Erdoğan
portrayed the economic crisis as an economic war against 'the devil's
triangle of interest and exchange rates and inflation.' 54 He compared
current economic problems with the War of Independence that Turkey
fought against the Western imperialist powers almost a century ago. In
this way, [he identified this new 'war' as another historical
figh]{.underline}t **[against those who want to divide the Turkish
nation]{.underline}** through terror attacks, coup attempts, and
economic restrictions.55 [Erdoğan framed the country's struggles as
']{.underline}us vs them' or '**[Turkey vs the West']{.underline}**,
which [allegedly tries to weaken and destabilize Turkey]{.underline}.56
[Through anti-Western rhetoric, Erdoğan **not only found a means to
exploit nationalism, but also portrayed the AKP-**]{.underline}MHP
alliance **[as an ultimate force to fight against foreign
enemies]{.underline}**. The ongoing anti-terror operations in Syria and
Iraq, and Turkish military activism abroad were also presented as a part
of Turkey's historical fight against its enemies. [The nationalistic
rhetoric and military operations]{.underline}, **[while appealing to the
nationalist base]{.underline}** at home, also discourage foreign
investors and further deepen the country's economic problems. However[,
the parties in the Nation Alliance]{.underline} were hesitant to oppose
Turkey's military operations. They **[did not want to be labeled as
being against Turkey's national security interests]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[pro-American]{.underline}** and pro-Western, [which
would only **strengthen the AKP-MHP alliance's hand
domestically**]{.underline}. Turkey's military activism against Kurdish
militias to contain domestic opposition also weakened domestic support
for pro-Kurdish HDP. Following the US withdrawal from Syria in the fall
of 2019, the TAF launched largest operation in Syria, 'Operation Peace
Spring', to create a 32km (20-mile) safe zone along the Syrian border.
With this operation, Turkey aimed to eliminate terror corridors in
northeastern Syria, push the Kurdish militia forces back from the
Turkish border, and resettle Syrian refugees in the safe zone. The
mobilization strategy as a risk-taking strategy escalated the conflict
in Syria, and resulted produced costs for Turkey, notably when dozens of
Turkish soldiers were killed by Russian-backed Syrian Air Forces in
Idlib in February 2020. The government reacted to the incident by
lifting the Western sea and land border controls, which allowed refugees
to cross into Europe through Greece. The AKP's reaction was also the
result of the EU's lack of financial commitment to Syrian refugees in
Turkey as part of the 2016 migration deal, as well as a lack of support
for Turkey's policies and military operations in Syria. In this way, the
government attempted to contain possible negative blowback from the
Turkish public, which was increasingly critical of Syrian refugees and
less supportive of Turkey's military operations in Syria. In addition,
to prevent domestic opposition and conceal Turkey's inability to respond
to the Russian-backed Assad regime, Turkish elites manipulated the
country's foreign policy and further escalated tension with Greece.
Thus, they have aimed to divert people's attention away from the Idlib
incident and foreign policy failures in Syria. 16 M. KARA The AKP has
also shifted its insulation strategy vis-à-vis the MHP to one of
cooptation with political favors and policy concessions. This shift
became visible during the summer of 2020. The AKP agreed to pass the
previously rejected amnesty law as a policy concession to contain the
MHP and a recognition that ignoring the MHP's demands and challenges was
no longer an option since it did not have a parliamentary majority to
rule on its own. The convicted former mafia leader, Alaattin Çakıcı, was
released from prison by benefiting from the partial amnesty law.57 Soon
thereafter, he posted a threatening letter on Twitter targeting the CHP
leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, as a response to Kılıçdaroğlu's criticism of
Bahçeli during the party parliamentary group meeting. AKP policymakers
initially remained silent to protect their alliance with the MHP, but
later initiated a probe against Çakıcı. Bahçeli backed Çakıcı and
described him as a 'son of an 'Ülkücü' (an ultra-nationalist) who loves
his country and nation.' 58 Since the AKP's political survival depends
on maintaining an alliance with the MHP, it combined its insulation
strategy accommodation by avoiding conflict on this issue. Another
example of the accommodation strategy is the AKP's adoption of the
ultra-nationalist rhetoric to show unity with the MHP. This strategy
raises an important problem for the AKP's authority because it provides
disproportionate power for the MHP compared to its size in parliament
and may lead to unintended consequences.59 Based on the idea of the
extremity of coalitions' foreign policy choices, coalition governments
are usually vulnerable to being hijacked by junior parties and are more
likely to adopt extreme foreign policy behaviors than single-party
governments.60 The hijacking is more likely if the government's survival
depends on the junior party and if the junior party's ideology is more
extreme than the larger parties within the coalition government.61 The
MHP offers a life vest for the AKP, but in return, hijacks the
government, receives policy concessions, and finds an opportunity to
implement its hawkish/nationalist policies. By 2021, Bahçeli was seen as
a very powerful person in Ankara, and he pulled Erdoğan toward
ultranationalism.62 The [AKP]{.underline}-MHP alliance **[constantly
underlines]{.underline}** [its capacity to **provide security and
protect Turkey's national interests**]{.underline} against all forms of
enemies. [Erdoğan claimed that]{.underline} 'We \[the
[AKP]{.underline}\] [continue to collaborate with MHP on issues
regarding our country's survival and future]{.underline}.' 63 His
statement stresses that cooperation between the two parties is necessary
for a country's survival rather than party survival. The nationalist
approach in the alliance aims to gain support for the government's
policies. Bahçeli uses similar rhetoric and underlines that the People's
Alliance 'will be the main protector of Turkey's future.' 64 He claims
that the alliance is'Turkey's only hope, its only guarantee against the
world.' 65 He [creates]{.underline} **[imaginary enemies and a 'Turkey
versus the rest' perception]{.underline}**. To this end, the
[AKP]{.underline}-MHP alliance [is no longer only targets opposition
figures]{.underline}, journalists, or foreign countries/nationals as the
enemy of the state, but **[anyone who opposes any of their
decisions]{.underline}** regardless of the issue. Being in opposition or
a dissident to the AKP or the alliance is equated with being a terrorist
or an enemy of the state who seeks to undermine the country's prosperity
and stability. From university students who protest state-appointed
rectors to medical workers who claim that official figures of actual
COVID19 cases were manipulated, everyone and anyone can be labeled as an
enemy of the state. In addition to military operations, Turkey has also
deployed military troops abroad as part of the government's mobilization
strategy. Turkey's pro-Qatari stance in Qatar dispute with its Gulf
neighbors facilitated the deployment of Turkish troops on Qatari soil in
June 2017. Turkey also opened its biggest overseas military base in the
Somali capital, Mogadishu, in September 2017. Nearly 1,500 Turkish
troops have been training Somali soldiers to help rebuild the country.
Turkey's commitment to the Somalis is part of the country's policy to
expand its influence in the Horn of Africa. In November 2019, Turkey
signed a memorandum with the UNbacked GNA government in Libya to
cooperate on various areas including military, maritime rules, and
drilling rights in the Mediterranean.66 The Turkish parliament also
approved military assistance and the deployment of Turkish troops in
Libya. Turkey's presence in Libya is a part of the Blue Homeland
doctrine and is important for maintaining a country's assertive policies
in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's cooperation with Libya is also an
act of retaliation against the alliance of the RoC, Greece, Egypt, and
Israel, which was created to limit Turkey's regional maneuvers and
isolate Turkey from regional issues. Thus, the AKP-MHP alliance portrays
the Blue Homeland doctrine from the nationalist narrative and describes
it as 'striking a balance' that has transformed Turkey into a 'game
setter' in the Eastern Mediterranean.67 To divert people's attention
from economic problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, Erdoğan also announced
the discovery of a total of 405 billion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves in the Black Sea, the largest hydrocarbon resource discovery in
Turkish history.68 These discoveries were announced as a way to reduce
the country's external dependency on natural gas by appealing to
nationalist sentiments. Through this, the AKP-MHP alliance would like to
validate the country's Blue Homeland doctrine and gain support for its
adventurous policies. This new doctrine offers an new area of
manipulation for Turkish foreign policymakers to contain domestic
opposition and change the narrative to something other than Turkey's
somewhat failed policies in Syria. The AKP's alliance with the MHP is
necessary to retain power, but, notably, it also limits the AKP's
foreign policy options on several issues. The AKP's conflict avoidance
strategy on the Çakıcı issue (the AKP initiated the probe case late and
is likely to stall the case for years) demonstrates the AKP's dependency
on the MHP. As the accommodation strategy suggests, any significant 18
M. KARA changes in Turkish foreign policy behavior without the MHP's
consent is almost impossible. For instance, it is difficult to initiate
a new phase in the Kurdish peace process, make a deal with Greece and
the RoC, change policies in Syria, and normalize Turkey's relations with
the US without the MHP's support or consent. Clashing statements from
both sides of the alliance over the recent crisis with Greece highlights
this problem. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Çavuşoğlu,
emphasized Turkey's openness to negotiations in settling differences
with Greece. However, Bahçeli claimed that 'Turkey will not negotiate
its interests.' 69 His statement restricts the AKP's ability to
de-escalate the crisis. [Although the AKP]{.underline} and MHP leaders
[insist on solidarity for the upcoming general election]{.underline}
(set to be held in 2023), [ongoing economic problems and domestic
instabilities continue]{.underline} **[to undermine constituents'
support for both parties and the alliance.]{.underline}**

[Faced with numerous challenges]{.underline} from outside and within,
**[it is rather unclear whether NATO possesses enough capabilities to
alleviate rivalries in the Mediterranean.]{.underline}**

Basbugoglu believes that while NATO played a crucial role in decreasing
the tensions between Turkey and the French-Greek alliance in the East
Mediterranean, the [bilateral problems within NATO]{.underline} like the
Turkish-French spat **[could decrease its conflict mitigation
capacity.]{.underline}**

Mikaïl, on the other hand, is [not sure if NATO can find a solution and
impose it on Turkey and Greece]{.underline}, but he believes it can
succeed in moderating stances. Still, unless Ankara gets some benefits
from negotiations, **[it will be hard to soften its
stance]{.underline}**.

[Under]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** of these
**[scenario]{.underline}**s, [there would likely b]{.underline}e **[less
change in Turkish foreign policy]{.underline}** [than what foreign
observers might expect or desire. **Turkey is no
exception**]{.underline} [to the fact that a country's foreign
policy]{.underline} **[is determined by factors]{.underline}** [such as
**history**, **geography**, the **international system**]{.underline},
[the regional **balance of power**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
**[national capacity,]{.underline}** as well as values, public opinion,
and the interests of the ruling elite. The [structural factors
wil]{.underline}l **[continue to play a significant]{.underline}**,
perhaps **[dominant role,]{.underline}** but values, public opinion, and
elite interests may be more variable over time.

Structural factors determine a country's long-term strategy. However,
how this is pursued could change significantly in the case of a change
in government.

Democratic reforms---whether limited, as in the "change of season"
scenario, or comprehensive, as in the "climate change" scenario---would
lead to warmer relations with Europe and the United States.
[Differences]{.underline} over Iraq, Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean,
the Southern Caucasus, or Libya **[would not just go
away]{.underline}**. However, warmer relations would mean that these
could be managed more effectively without turning into major crises.
Turkey has already started to seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and
its regional network as well as with Israel to overcome the diplomatic
isolation it is facing in its region, but it could do so much more
credibly with a new government that does not support the Muslim
Brotherhood and similar networks in the Middle East.

[A new government]{.underline} **[would not abandon Turkey's
relationship with Russia]{.underline}**, but one that enjoys warmer
relations with Western allies would probably frame this relationship in
a way that does not conflict with Turkey's NATO membership. The country
would continue to pursue its perceived interests in the Eastern
Mediterranean under a new government but, no longer diplomatically
isolated, it would use diplomacy as opposed to coercion as its principal
tool. In short, [Turkish foreign policy would change in
style]{.underline} **[if not essence in the case of a political
transition.]{.underline}**

#### His predecessors won't change anything. This answers [every scenario]{.underline}

Both his admirers and detractors agree that President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan has radically transformed Turkish foreign policy. But[, if
Erdoğan were to leave power, would Turkey's approach to the world
"normalize"]{.underline} and turn back to its pre-Erdoğan settings? With
economic conditions in Turkey worsening, public outrage over the country
' s mismanagement mounting, and Erdoğan ' s health visibly declining,
this question has generated increasing debate.

Under Erdoğan, [Turkey has embraced aggressive military
initiatives]{.underline}, worked with radical or criminal groups, made
friendly overtures to revisionist powers like Russia and China, and
distanced itself from Western institutions and values. **[Yet, it would
be misleading to attribute all these changes to Erdoğan or his
party.]{.underline}**

Beyond any doubt, the [absence]{.underline} of a reckless, ambitious,
and hot-tempered leader [will have a positive impact on decision-making
in Ankara.]{.underline} Institutions, particularly the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, might have more influence, bringing greater stability
and consistency to Ankara ' s foreign relations. Turkey ' s NATO and E.U
partners would most likely find Erdoğan ' s successors more agreeable
and easier to communicate with.

[But, if Erdoğan is voted out of office]{.underline}, [**no one in
Washington or Brussels should expect Turkey to suddenly turn into a
docile and obedient ally**. Structural changes in the international
environment, broader bureaucratic and ideological trends]{.underline} in
Turkey, and new facts on the ground that Erdoğan has created [will all
limit]{.underline} the **[potential for "normalization" in post-Erdoğan
Turkey.]{.underline}**

Navigating a Changing World

The first factor to consider is the [role of **changing global
dynamics**]{.underline} in [encouraging Ankara to look for
alternatives]{.underline} to its traditional allies and
[embrace]{.underline} **[a more independent foreign
policy.]{.underline}**

In an increasingly multi-polar world, the Justice and Development Party
(AKP) government has improved its relations with countries like Russia,
Iran, and China. And, when its interests have diverged from those of its
NATO and E.U allies, Turkey has taken unilateral diplomatic and military
initiatives such as joining the Astana mechanism together with Russia
and Iran or carrying out its own energy exploration in disputed waters
in the Eastern Mediterranean.

For [Turkish policymakers, Washington ' s handling of the Syrian civil
war exemplified the shift toward a more multi-polar world]{.underline}.
President Barack Obama ' s failure to adhere to his chemical weapons red
line in Syria was a major disappointment for Turkey. Tellingly, Ankara
initiated negotiations with a Chinese defense company for an FD-2000
missile system in the wake of Obama ' s 2013 decision, while Erdoğan
also reiterated his desire to join Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

More broadly, [NATO ' s hesitant stance toward the dangers
Turkey]{.underline} has perceived from Syria **[sharpened Ankara ' s
sense of loneliness]{.underline}**. In 2012, the Syrian military shot
down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, and Syrian rockets hit
southern Turkish cities. In 2015, [Russian warplanes repeatedly violated
Turkish airspace]{.underline}, leading Turkey to shoot down a Russian
jet. NATO ' [s failure to wholeheartedly support Turkey]{.underline} in
each of these crises **[helped push Ankara toward a more independent
foreign policy]{.underline}**.

This is not to say Turkey has managed these new dynamics well. Instead
of safely navigating in a changing global and regional environment,
[Turkey seems to oscillate between great powers.]{.underline} Many in
the U.S and European capitals now see Turkey as a hostile power rather
than as an ally. Yet, despite this, Ankara has still failed to establish
a sound and healthy relationship with Russia and China.

[Future Turkish governments will wrestle]{.underline} with the same
structural factors but may do so more effectively than the current
government. If Washington continues shifting attention to the
Asia-Pacific while conducting a rudderless or absentee policy in the
Middle East, and if the European Union remains incapable of engaging
effectively with developments beyond its borders, Turkish policy will
respond accordingly. This does not mean a rupture in Turkey ' s
relations with the United States or the European Union. But it does mean
that [Ankara will push back if Western audiences don ' t share its
concerns about terrorism or regional crises, especially in Syria and
Iraq.]{.underline} In the meantime, [Ankara will still have to cooperate
with Russia in order to manage the challenges the Syrian crisis
poses.]{.underline} And, in parallel with China ' s growing influence in
the region, Ankara might get even closer to Beijing. Regional power
vacuums and instability may force Turkey to take direct action. In
short, compared to the Cold War period, **[Ankara may choose a more
autonomous way between great powers]{.underline}** [rather than sticking
to its]{.underline} **[Western allies]{.underline}**.

Cross-Party Trends

Key aspects of Turkey ' s current foreign policy also reflect
longstanding bureaucratic and ideological trends that cross party lines.

[Turkey has]{.underline} **[never been shy about using its military
might]{.underline}**, [even before Erdoğan.]{.underline} The [annexation
of Hatay in]{.underline} 1939 was an early example of Ankara ' s
willingness to [back up diplomacy with bribes, guerilla tactics, and the
threat of military intervention]{.underline} in order to achieve its
expansionist goals. In 1974, [Turkey took half of the island of
Cyprus]{.underline} and still [keeps thousands of its troops
ther]{.underline}e. **[On-and-off tensions with Greece]{.underline}**
[over maritime issues]{.underline} in the Aegean Sea have [escalated
into armed confrontations]{.underline} quite often. [Turkish
intelligence,]{.underline} according to Behlül Özkan, [intervened in the
Syrian government ' s conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood in the
1980s]{.underline} by covertly assisting the latter. In 1998, the
Turkish military threatened Syria by piling up military units at the
Turkish-Syrian border in order to oust Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of
the Kurdistan Workers ' Party (PKK), from Damascus. More importantly,
the [Turkish military has been fighting with the Kurdistan Workers '
Party for almost 40 years]{.underline} and has carried out countless
cross-border operations into Iraqi territories. **[Hence, it is possible
to consider Turkey ' s recent armed operations as part of this bellicose
tradition.]{.underline}**

Indeed, [Erdoğan ' s military expansionism]{.underline} **[has received
vigorous support from the military and civil bureaucracy]{.underline}**.
The inventors and promoters of the concept of "Blue Homeland," which was
coined to express Turkey ' s maritime objectives in the eastern
Mediterranean, were retired generals Cihat Yaycı and Cem Gürdeniz. Ryan
Gingeras argues that their popularity in the Turkish media [revealed
"the ascendency of a more aggressive and antagonistic strain of thought
within Turkish security circles]{.underline}" --- which **[implies a
more enduring strategic view]{.underline}**. Even in the absence of
Erdoğan, [this line of thought]{.underline} **[may maintain its
dominance]{.underline}** in Ankara.

Similarly, [there was agreement among the high echelons of the
bureaucracy about]{.underline} Turkey ' s operations in
[Syria]{.underline}. In a leaked voice recording from 2014,
then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmet Davutoglu, his
then-undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, then-Deputy Chief of the
General Staff Yasar Güler, and head of intelligence Hakan Fidan were
discussing the necessity of intervention, whether be it covertly or
militarily. Since then, widespread purges after the 2016 coup attempt
have eliminated more restrained views and have homogenized the military
bureaucracy. Turkish generals who had defied Erdoğan ' s plans to carry
out a military intervention between 2011 and 2016 have been imprisoned
for more than five years.

[The Turkish bureaucracy ' s security-oriented mindset draws a boundary
for Turkish foreign policy]{.underline}. [Given that **regional
challenges, instabilities, and a power vacuum**]{.underline} [will
continue to exist for the foreseeable futur]{.underline}e, **[armed
interventions will continue to be an attractive option]{.underline}**
for an increasingly more confident bureaucratic elite. What ' s more,
[Turkey ' s non-combat missions,]{.underline} like the Turkish military
base in Qatar, [provide a lucrative career track for the military
elite]{.underline} --- which is another bureaucratic incentive to
maintain Turkey ' s military expansionism.

[There is also an ideological dimension]{.underline}. [Anti-Americanism
is not a phenomenon limited to Justice and Development Party voters or
ultra-nationalists either]{.underline}. Today, **[the great majority of
Turkish society finds the United States unreliable]{.underline}**,
[while trust in Russia is higher]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
**[hostile suspicion]{.underline}** of the United States, which is
prevalent among the opposition too, [will continue to]{.underline}
**[complicate bilateral relations as Erdoğan ' s successors will be
obliged to demonstrate Turkey ' s autonomy]{.underline}** from the
United States. In this context, many of the [disputes]{.underline}
between Ankara and Washington, such as Halkbank sanctions and U.S
-Democratic Union Party (PYD) relations, **[will not be easy to
solve]{.underline}**.

The Russian S-400 air defense systems, for example, will continue to
pose a challenge to U.S -Turkish relations even after Erdoğan. The
attitude that the opposition Republican People ' s Party (CHP) has
adopted toward the S-400 issue falls short of satisfying NATO partners.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the party ' s leader, openly supported the purchase
on the grounds of Turkey ' s urgent need for an air defense system, and
he has criticized U.S sanctions against Turkey ' s sovereign acts. Even
though Kılıçdaroğlu later began questioning the necessity of the S-400s,
his party ' s position has not changed dramatically. For example, Ünal
Çeviköz, a former career diplomat who serves as Kılıçdaroğlu ' s foreign
policy advisor, not only supports the S-400 purchase but also demands
their immediate activation.

The opposition has also supported many of the government ' s military
initiatives. From 2012 up until this year, the Republican People ' s
Party backed bills that mandate the government conduct military
operations in Syria, Libya, and Azerbaijan. Kılıçdaroğlu expressed his
support for the 2016 Operation Euphrates Shield, the 2018 Afrin
operation, and the 2019 Peace Spring operation. After all, in its
election bulletin, Kılıçdaroğlu ' s party promises a withdrawal from
Syria after the successful accomplishment of Turkey ' s military
missions there --- a position in line with government ' s current
policy.

What ' s Done Is Done

[Turkey ' s expansionism]{.underline} in recent years has **[introduced
a new reality in the region]{.underline}** --- a [reality
that]{.underline} **[cannot be undone easily]{.underline}**. [Ankara has
made **new commitments**]{.underline}, become entangled in webs of
interests, [and]{.underline} made [investments in the areas where
Turkish troops and intelligence have set foot. Although these are
politically, militarily, and economically expensive
initiatives]{.underline}, **[a retreat might be costlier]{.underline}**
[in terms of]{.underline} the **[regional power balance and domestic
political standing]{.underline}**. Thus, [even if a new Turkish
government wants disengagement,]{.underline} **[withdrawing Turkish
troops or ending military engagements would be quite
complicated.]{.underline}**

In Libya, for example, withdrawing support from the Government of
National Accord would be hard if Turkey wants to keep its maritime deal
in the Eastern Mediterranean afloat or protect \$20 billion worth of
business interests. In Syria, the refugee issue, the existence of the
Democratic Union Party, and the activities of radical jihadist groups
will complicate any withdrawal plan. Turkey ' s fight against the
Kurdistan Workers ' Party may stimulate new military initiatives in
northern Iraq. The drones that have been delivered to Ukraine will be an
issue in relations with Russia. Likewise, the Turkish military ' s (and
Turkish drones ' ) existence in Qatar, the Horn of Africa, and the
Caucasus will be potential sources of conflict with the Gulf countries,
Egypt, and Iran.

[Ankara's relations]{.underline} with new regional blocs, which have
been designed to balance Erdoğan's government, [will be delicate
too.]{.underline} Energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean and
[Turkey ' s aggressiveness]{.underline} have [facilitated a pact between
Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, and Israel, plus the United Arab
Emirates]{.underline}. But a new government in Ankara and renewed
diplomatic niceties do not automatically mean that this alliance will
break, or that Turkey will enter into it. Greco-Turkish rivalry and
maritime borders might continue to generate tensions in the region.

The Syrian diaspora in Turkey could also be an influential factor,
particularly in Turkey ' s relations with the Assad regime and Israel.
There are 3.6 million registered Syrian refugees in Turkey. The Syrian
population in the country is most likely much higher if unregistered
immigrants and those who have already received their citizenships are
accounted for. Even though the Turkish state, the opposition, and
Turkish society hope for these Syrian refugees ' re-settlement in Syria,
it is likely that the great majority of them will stay permanently in
Turkey. When they gain the voting rights that come with Turkish
citizenship, this new constituency may have long-lasting effects on
Turkey ' s Middle East policy.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, [Erdoğan has time and again
proved how **assertiveness and expansionism**]{.underline} [in foreign
policy **can be useful in domestic politics**]{.underline}. [They help
to mobilize]{.underline} **[nationalist sentiments among
voters]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[divert attention away from
domestic troubles.]{.underline}** Furthermore, throughout the last few
years, [Turkish voters have enjoyed the feelings of grandeur Turkey ' s
military operations and drones have aroused]{.underline}. **[The popular
demand for mightiness]{.underline}**, [or the need for diversion from
internal problems]{.underline}, **[could also seduce Erdoğan ' s
successors, who will command a seasoned military force.]{.underline}**

So far, there is little sign that western nations or any other regional
or world power are preparing for any outcome other than a clean Erdogan
victory. But [Turks are already discussing what could
happen]{.underline} **[if he loses the election and refuses to
relinquish power.]{.underline}**

Like Belarus dictator Aleksander Lukashenko in 2020, [some worry that
Erdogan and his allies would cheat so egregiously and crack down on
opponents]{.underline} so harshly that world [leaders would be unable to
sweep the matter under the rug]{.underline}. There is also the
possibility that Erdogan wins the presidency but loses the parliament,
or that a new centre-left administration comes into power in Ankara and
renews demands to enter the EU.

None of this is high on the agenda of western policymakers. They are now
focused on trying to convince Erdogan to allow Finland and Sweden to
join Nato and bolster the coalition confronting Russia in Ukraine.

\"We are not there yet,\" said one senior western official, when asked
what if any preparations were being made for a scenario in Turkey in
which protests would be violently crushed, opposition leaders jailed and
results possibly forged.

Whether Erdogan defies the polls and cleanly wins, loses and gracefully
steps aside to allow the opposition to take over or goes the Lukashenko
route, Turkey\'s Nato allies, neighbours, and western business partners
will face big questions.

\"I have the feeling that the west is in a waiting mode about what is
going to happen in 2023,\"says Senem Aydin-Duzgit, a professor of
international relations at Istanbul\'s Sabanci University. \"They don\'t
have a plan for what they\'ll do if the opposition wins. And that
baffles me, because it could mean huge changes.\"

Trailing badly to several prominent opposition figures in multiple
polls, [Erdogan is **already attempting to level the playing
field**]{.underline}. [Turkish courts, heavily packed with loyalists to
Erdogan]{.underline} and his Justice and Development Party (AKP), have
[targeted a number of his opponents on specious criminal
charges.]{.underline}

Last month, a court upheld a four-year sentence against Canan
Kaftancioglu, head of the centre-left opposition Republican People\'s
Party\'s (CHP) Istanbul branch, on charges that include insulting
Erdogan. The charismatic rising political star is widely considered the
architect of the 2019 victory by Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu over
Erdogan\'s hand-picked candidate.

Imamoglu, among the possible presidential contenders against Erdogan, is
facing charges of insulting the country\'s election commission in a case
that was adjourned last week until September.

Meanwhile, Selahattin Demirtas, the youthful onetime leader of the
opposition People\'s Democratic Party (HDP) remains in prison after
being locked up in 2016 on various terror-related charges. HDP members,
including members of parliament, are regularly arrested and charged with
security-related offences.

Erodgan\'s impending ground incursion against ethnic Kurdish-led armed
groups in Syria is meant in part to rally the Turkish public around the
flag. He claims hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, which Turks
increasingly consider a burden, will voluntarily relocate to the
expanded buffer zone he hopes to forge.

[So far, the]{.underline} [machinations have failed to win over voters,
enraged and disillusioned by what they perceive as economic
mismanagement]{.underline}, with inflation reaching a 24-year high of
73.5 per cent.

Multiple opinion polls conducted over months by various firms suggest
that Imamoglu, as well as CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu and Ankara mayor
Mansur Yavas, would handily trounce Erdogan were elections held now.
Despite its legal troubles, HDP still polls over the 10 per cent
threshold necessary to win a parliamentary bloc.

On the other hand, Erdogan\'s coalition partner, the far-right
Nationalist Movement Party, has sunk to single digits while the CHP\'s
partner, the Good or Iyi Party has become the country\'s third most
popular political group.

All this points to a trouncing that few who know the pugnacious Erdogan
and have closely watched Turkey over the years believe he would accept.
[Erdogan]{.underline} **[has a track record of refusing to bow down in
the face of electoral setbacks]{.underline}**. [In 2015,
after]{.underline} faring poorly in general elections, [he engineered a
second election in which the AKP did well enough to govern without a
coalition. In 2019, he refused to accept]{.underline} Imamoglu\'s
[narrow victory,]{.underline} **[demanding another
election]{.underline}**, which Imamoglu won even more handily.

[Many dread the political upheavals]{.underline} **[that could erupt in
the Nato nation]{.underline}** in 2023 - or sooner if Erdogan decides to
call early elections. While staff at western embassies and consulates
have begun quiet discussions for the sake of the security of their
personnel and to offer up potential policy options, key decision-makers
in western capitals have yet to place Turkey on their agendas.

\"I really worry about it,\" says Nicholas Danforth, a Turkey expert at
the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. **[\"I don\'t
think anyone has a plan.\"]{.underline}**

Among the options that could be considered in case Erdogan seeks to
egregiously steal the election are sanctions, an arms embargo or
expulsion from the Council of Europe. \"It would probably depend on how
ugly it was,\" says Danforth. \"If there were protests and violence and
arrests, I could see some slightly stronger measures.\"

[Western leaders]{.underline} will be careful. If they [punish Erdogan
too harshly,]{.underline} it **[could push Turkey further into the
sphere of influence of Russia and China]{.underline}**. Ankara could
also renege on the multi-billion-dollar deal that requires it to prevent
refugees from crossing over into Europe.

Given the major questions that could arise in any election dispute, some
wonder whether [leaders in]{.underline} Brussels, London and
[Washington]{.underline} **[would prefer a victory by
Erdogan]{.underline}**, whom they have been grappling with for 20 years,
over the messiness of a new administration in Ankara.

\"I feel no one wants to think about it,\" says Aydin-Duzgit. \"[They
are comfortable dealing with the leader they are used to dealing with.
He\'s someone they don\'t want to totally include into the western
security alliance]{.underline}, **[but as long as there is not much
trouble, they won\'t feel the need of having a Turkey
policy.\"]{.underline}**

Erdogan may engage in more subtle chicanery that provides him with
enough of a clean win to give western leaders an excuse to let any
transgressions slide, as they do with Hungary\'s prime minister, Viktor
Orban. He regularly uses gerrymandering of electoral districts and
control of media to win elections that are technically free but grossly
unfair.

As one Washington insider quipped: \"I **[don\'t think]{.underline}**
Recep Tayyip **[Erdogan has any plan to lose.\"]{.underline}**

accessed 6/23/2022) ng

The West has greater leverage [The West]{.underline}, however, [has its
own tools to bind Turkey to NATO]{.underline}. Most importantly, **[the
West has a superior power to reward Turkey]{.underline}**. For instance,
analysts often refer to close economic ties between Turkey and Russia,
but [the EU is by far Turkey's largest trading partner and main source
of investments, accounting for 33.4% of Turkey's imports and 41.3% of
its exports in 2020 (and 21 out of the 27 EU member states are also
members of NATO). Military relations between Turkey and NATO also favour
the West]{.underline}. **[NATO's collective defense protects Turkey, and
the decades-old alliance ties have made Turkey far more dependent on the
West than on Russia.]{.underline}** The S-400 system is expensive, but
the delivery to Turkey began only in 2019, and Russia accounts for only
5% of arms import by Turkey in the last ten years between 2012 and 2021.
During the decade, Russia ranked below other weapons suppliers of Turkey
such as the United States (51%), Italy (16%), Spain (13%), and South
Korea (6%) according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute's Arms Transfers Database. For binding Turkey to NATO and
wedging Turkey away from Russia, we recommend reward-based strategies
rather than coercion. Academic literature suggests that [positive
sanctions work better and that a coercive approach is chosen by those
with weaker reward power]{.underline}. A coercive strategy can easily
antagonize the target, whereas a reward-based strategy is unlikely to
worsen the status quo. Reward-binding is particularly important in
relation to the Turkish public, who have resented the West's treatment
of their country in the aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis and the
2016 coup attempt against Erdoğan. This anti-Western sentiment has been
further exacerbated by pro-government Turkish media. In fact, unlike the
seemingly neutral position of the Turkish government in this
Russia-Ukraine war, Turkish mass media is dominated by anti-Western
discourse and criticism against NATO. A poll in March revealed that
48.3% of Turks blamed the United States and NATO for the current
situation in Ukraine and only 33.7% thought Russia was responsible. In
the same poll, 51.7% of Turks see the United States as the biggest
threat to their country as opposed to Russia (19.4%). As a Turkish
scholar points out, anti-Western sentiments that developed for years
will not easily disappear from the Turkish public opinion even after
Erdoğan's recent U-turn. In international security and diplomacy,
**[NATO allies have already begun taking a conciliatory approach toward
Ankara]{.underline}**. This can be [seen in]{.underline} the [recent
Franco-Turkish rapprochement and the Biden administration's support for
"appropriate U.S. defense trade ties with Turkey." **Economic
reward-binding by NATO allies is likely to be appreciated by
Erdoğan**]{.underline}, who faces the presidential election in 2023.
More importantly, this is a chance for the West to offer the olive
branch to the Turkish public as Turkey experiences the highest level of
inflation in 20 years, with Erdoğan's economic mismanagement, the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine creating a perfect storm for
the economy. Deepening of the EU-Turkey customs union and other positive
economic incentives are useful tools to improve media freedom and human
rights in Turkey, and the West should ask for domestic political
concessions from Erdoğan. Rather than using Turkey's political problems
as excuses to keep Turkey at distance, however, economic rewards should
be employed to bind the hearts of the Turkish public to NATO.

So far, the **[machinations]{.underline}** [have]{.underline} **[failed
to win over voters]{.underline}**, [enraged and disillusioned by what
they perceive as economic mismanagemen]{.underline}t, with inflation
reaching a 24-year high of 73.5 per cent.

Multiple [opinion polls conducted]{.underline} over months by various
firms [suggest]{.underline} that [Imamoglu]{.underline}, as well as [CHP
leader]{.underline} Kemal Kilicdaroglu and [Ankara mayor]{.underline}
Mansur Yavas, **[would handily trounce Erdogan were elections held
now]{.underline}**. Despite its legal troubles, [HDP still polls over
the 10 per cent threshold necessary to win a parliamentary
bloc.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [Erdogan\'s coalition partner]{.underline}, the
far-right Nationalist Movement Party, [**has sunk to single digits**
while the CHP\'s partner,]{.underline} the Good or Iyi Party has
**[become the country\'s third most popular political
group.]{.underline}**

[All this points to a]{.underline} **[trouncing]{.underline}** that few
who know the pugnacious Erdogan and have closely watched Turkey over the
years believe he would accept. Erdogan has a track record of refusing to
bow down in the face of electoral setbacks. In 2015, after faring poorly
in general elections, he engineered a second election in which the AKP
did well enough to govern without a coalition. In 2019, he refused to
accept Imamoglu\'s narrow victory, demanding another election, which
Imamoglu won even more handily.

[Turkish opposition figures]{.underline} **[are gaining ground among
voters]{.underline}** [ahead of the]{.underline} country\'s critical
[2023]{.underline} presidential [elections]{.underline} and are
**[likely to pose a major threat to]{.underline}** President Recep
Tayyip **[Erdogan]{.underline}** and his ruling party,recent surveys
show.

Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yavas, who head
two opposition-controlled municipalities in Turkey\'s largest cities,
previously challenged Erdogan and his party in the March 2019 local
elections.

And recent meetings between leaders of the opposition have hinted at
efforts to develop a joint candidate figure who can appeal to wider
segments of Turkish society.

[The latest survey from]{.underline} Istanbul Economics, a leading
research company, [showed]{.underline} that **[Yavas and Imamoglu are
now performing better than Erdogan in polls.]{.underline}**

Results show that **[52.5 percent of voters prefer Yavas against
Erdogan\'s 38.1 percent]{.underline}** [when asked who they would vote
for if a presidential election was held today.]{.underline}

Similarly, **[51.4 percent of voters would choose Imamoglu against
Erdogan\'s 39.9 percent]{.underline}** [in a presidential election. They
would also prefer Meral Aksener, chairwoman of the center right IYI
Party, with 45.4 percent, against Erdogan\'s 39.1 percent.]{.underline}

[The survey]{.underline}, titled Turkey Report, [was conducted across 12
cities using 1506 respondents.]{.underline} The polling company recently
[revealed]{.underline} that [**popular support** for]{.underline} the
ruling Justice and Development Party (**[AKP]{.underline}**) [and its
nationalist partner MHP]{.underline} **[was down to 45
percen]{.underline}**t, with the opposition standing at 55 percent.

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic has **[also undermined trust in the
government]{.underline}**, [due to perceived failures in handling the
outbreak in Turkey.]{.underline}

[Erdogan]{.underline} recently [asked for \"forgiveness\" from Turks who
have faced financial struggles due to pandemic restrictions **and the
subsequent economic downturn.**]{.underline}

Dr. Berk Esen, a political scientist from Sabanci University in
Istanbul, said that there are [several reasons for the decline in
Erdogan\'s popularity in recent months.]{.underline}

\"The **[pandemic has worsened]{.underline}** th[e economic downturn
that had already severely hit the urban poor]{.underline}, **[many of
whom are loyal to the ruling party,\"]{.underline}** he told Arab News.

\"[Many voters fee]{.underline}l that the [Erdogan]{.underline}
administration [has done a poor job of dealing with the
pandemic,]{.underline} both medically and economically,\" Esen said.

\"Although Turkey has been spared the catastrophe seen in other
right-wing populist cases like Brazil and India, [case numbers are still
too high and vaccination efforts have not gone smoothly]{.underline}.
Turkey has only managed to vaccinate 13 percent of its population and
has experienced difficulty acquiring more vaccines from multiple
sources,\" he added.

The number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in Turkey reached 25
million on Monday, however, over-reliance on China\'s Sinovac jab and
shipment [delays]{.underline} **[thought to be politically
motivated]{.underline}** [have put the country in a dangerous position
amid surging infection rates.]{.underline}

The pandemic has also threatened the livelihoods of disadvantaged people
in the country, with family suicides and bankruptcies of small business
owners becoming more prevalent. Many people, including AKP voters, are
beginning to feel left behind, Esen said.

\"Government precautions against the pandemic are seen by many to be
insufficient, scientifically not all that helpful, ill-planned and
selectively applied. Such restrictions hurt local businesses and created
unemployment across the country,\" he added.

During the first quarter of 2021, about 29,000 shopkeepers closed their
businesses, an increase of 11 percent compared with the same period in
2020.

Large pro-government rallies and other \"super-spreader\" events like
mass protests have also sparked public outcry in the country. Many Turks
have accused the government of double standards regarding pandemic
measures, including social distancing rules.

Esen said that [despite rising poverty and unemployment figures, the
government has offered only limited social assistance to the
poo]{.underline}r, distributing less than most other OECD member
countries.

\"[There is a growing sentiment among voters]{.underline} that the [AKP
treats its own members favorably thanks to **cronyism**, vast
**corruption schemes** and **shady business deals,\"**]{.underline} he
added.

\"Against this backdrop, [opposition mayors]{.underline} of major
metropolitan areas like Istanbul and Ankara [have seen their popularity
rise]{.underline} due to the increased reliance on social assistance by
the urban poor and the provision of public services to low-income
neighborhoods,\" Esen said.

https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/how-turkeys-election-bill-could-backfire-erdogans-ruling-party,
accessed 6-24-2022, WMK

[Turkey's ruling party and its de facto coalition partner revealed a
long-awaited draft amendment to the country's election law]{.underline}
March 14. The bill is expected to become law in April with the
alliance's majority vote. According to Turkey's constitution, [electoral
changes must come into effect]{.underline} **[at least one year before
elections]{.underline}**, [meaning that it\'s too late for the bill to
affect any snap elections]{.underline} before the general and
presidential elections scheduled for 2023.

[Erdogan has been talking about an overhaul in the election law since
last year, promising "a very different" electoral system]{.underline}. A
senior bureaucrat working for the Ministry of Interior told Al-Monitor
on condition of anonymity, "Experts studied this bill over a year and
there were different proposals, simulations run. They picked this
version."

The [changes]{.underline} that the draft [introduced in the country's
electoral system affect vote distribution, election monitoring and
presidential privileges]{.underline}.

First, the [draft lowers the country's **notoriously high** threshold
for a party to win parliamentary seats from 10% of the national vote to
7%.]{.underline}

According to Kemal Ozkiraz, founder and chairman of the Avrasya polling
company, the move [might motivate small parties to]{.underline} **[form
coalitions of their own]{.underline}**, apart from the major parties.
Yet the change also allows the ruling Justice and Development Party
(AKP) and its ally the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) to enter the
parliament, as their vote shares are projected below 10%, Ozkiraz
argued.

[The bill is a reversal of the 2018 alliance system that allowed parties
to form alliances in a bid to clear the 10%]{.underline} threshold
together but remain distinct. The coalitions received a percentage of
the overall vote and then the seats were distributed proportionally.

The [bill aims to eliminate the alliance vote-sharing
system.]{.underline} Each party will instead win seats based in a
proportional system called the D\'Hondt system. Accordingly, [small
parties with a vote share of 3-4% will not be able to win any
seats.]{.underline}

Gokhan Ozbek, director of the independent 23 Derece YouTube news
channel, calculated how the votes would have been distributed if the
amendment had been in effect during Turkey's 2018 general election.
According to his findings, the AKP and its coalition partner would have
gained 12 and four more seats, respectively.

[Turkey's pro-Kurdish]{.underline} People\'s Democratic Party
([HDP]{.underline}), meanwhile, **[would also have won four more
seats]{.underline}**. [Its gains would have cost]{.underline} the main
opposition Republican People's Party ([CHP]{.underline}) **[15
seats]{.underline}** and its ally the Good or Iyi Party another five,
meaning the Good Party would not have won any seats if the new law had
been in effect in 2018.

However, Ozkiraz and Ozbek concurred that the AKP's vote share, which
had been some 42%, today ranges between 25% and 35%, so **[the new bill
could backfire and hurt the ruling alliance.]{.underline}**

Professor emeritus of public law Levent Koker told Al-Monitor, "[On the
basis of the 2018 vote distribution, the AKP-MHP coalition would gain
the advantage]{.underline} with this law**[, but that advantage could
turn into disadvantage in 2023 if the vote distribution is
different.]{.underline}** [Small right-wing parties in the opposition
coalition]{.underline} **[might enter the election as a part of a bigger
party to overcome this hurdle."]{.underline}**

If [the ruling alliance's goal was to shock and awe in a bid to
dismantle the opposition]{.underline}, so far **[it hasn't
worked.]{.underline}** [The mood]{.underline} among left-leaning
politicians and political pundits in Ankara **[has been
sanguine]{.underline}**. [The CHP's leadership appeared]{.underline}
**[unfazed]{.underline}**, with its parliamentary leader Ozgur Ozel
commenting in a televised interview, "**[The AKP will fall into the
trap]{.underline}** they are setting for us."

### 2AC --- Thumper --- Ukraine

#### Ukraine thumps---gives Erdogan a [political win]{.underline} which will [swing the election]{.underline} --- [diverts attention]{.underline} from the economy and political crackdowns

accessed 6-24-2022, WMK

Yet [since the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} began nearly
three weeks ago, [there has been]{.underline} a newfound **[optimism
among the AKP ranks]{.underline}**. No one can deny that the invasion
will cost Turkey, as it will lead to revenue losses from tourism to
agriculture.

However, [AKP elites]{.underline} also **[see this as a God-sent
opportunity to sweep the 2023 elections.]{.underline}**

One senior bureaucrat told Al-Monitor on the condition of anonymity,
"[From every crisis]{.underline} --- including the 2008 recession, the
Dec. 17-25 attacks, the July 15 coup attempt, you name it --- [Erdogan
has managed to come out with]{.underline} **[fine colors, sometimes even
with a stronger grip on the political institutions.]{.underline}** [Now
he is on a charm offensive, hosting leaders from Greece to Israel to the
UAE]{.underline}. We are confident that **[we will wipe the opposition
off the table for good in the 2023 elections."]{.underline}**

[It is not just those associated with the AKP]{.underline} **[who can
see opportunities]{.underline}** for Erdogan in this crisis. One can
explain three prominent reasons for this optimism.

First are the [security vulnerabilities]{.underline} that will [snowball
due to the war]{.underline} and **[Erdogan\'s ability to blame the
worsening economy on the regional turmoil.]{.underline}**

Levent Gultekin, a prominent political analyst and author, told
Al-Monitor that alongside the economic shock, \"[The war on Ukraine will
create a security concern. **The public will now worry about the
possibilities of the spread of this conflict.**]{.underline} [When
publics worry about their national security]{.underline}, **[they also
start yearning for strong leadership]{.underline}**. So, I can see that
the [increasing fear and unease]{.underline} added with a divided
opposition [can easily **benefit the incumbent**]{.underline}. In
addition, [the national security concerns could]{.underline} **[cloud
judgment]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} **[economic
despair]{.underline}** and blur the focus on accountability. The weak
economy will be accepted as due to war, and [the reality of the
government-made economic vulnerabilities]{.underline} **[will be
invisible."]{.underline}**

The second reason is [the war will detract attention from]{.underline}
the [crackdown on]{.underline} the country's [political
opposition]{.underline}. With regards to controlling the opposition, the
[government has gradually cracked down on opponents,]{.underline}
particularly the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). [Several
party members]{.underline}, including its former co-chair, Selahattin
Demirtas, [remain behind bars]{.underline}.

[Fair media representation stands as another factor. Most of the
country's media outlets are effectively under the control of the
government.]{.underline}

Seren Selvin Korkmaz, a political analyst and executive director of
IstanPol Institute, told Al-Monitor that the "visibility of opposition
parties in the press is already low, and [with war going on in the
region]{.underline} **[their voices will be heard even
less."]{.underline}**

[On Feb. 28,]{.underline} the country's [six opposition parties revealed
their roadmap]{.underline} outlining their [plans to reinstate the
parliamentary system]{.underline} and to strengthen the country's
democracy. [The gathering did not generate **much
excitement**]{.underline} among the public, [with Turks\' attention
focused **sharply on Ukraine.**]{.underline}

There is still one and a half years left until the presidential and
parliamentary elections in Turkey, due simultaneously in June 2023,
according to the law. But the country appears to have already switched
to poll mode, as [political tensions]{.underline}
**[escalate]{.underline}** between the ruling alliance and opposition
bloc over the question of when to hold the elections.

But today, with the presidential system, both [political]{.underline}
successes and **[failures are attributed directly to
politicians]{.underline}**. [This puts civilians at the centre of
political discussions]{.underline} and shows that the government will be
held directly responsible for its failures.

The new system also forces political parties with clear differences -
from ideology to ethno-cultural issues - to work together in certain
alliances, showing how fundamentally the political space of Turkey has
transformed.

In this context, besides the alliance of the AKP and MHP, the diverse
character of the opposition bloc has revealed an interesting picture.
Under the Nation Alliance, the CHP, a centre-left secular party with a
strong Kemalist emphasis, has been allied with the nationalist and
centre-right Iyi Party, and the Felicity Party, a party that defends
some sort of Islamism.

But the Nation Alliance also has some unlikely partners, such as the
Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP), a predominantly Kurdish movement with
leftist tendencies. During the latest municipality elections, the HDP
gave strong support to the Nation Alliance's candidates in Istanbul and
Ankara.

Also, newly established centre-right operations the Future Party and
DEVA Party, which broke from the AK Party ranks, appear to support the
Nation Alliance.

It shows that for the first time in the republic's history, seeking a
political consensus has become a dominant aspect of the country under
the presidential system, even though tensions between the ruling and
opposition camps have continued to escalate. As a result, the most
decisive factor in the upcoming elections will be the character of
political alliances and their ability to forge reconciliation and
national consensus.

The empty pot

As with every other country, [in Turkey]{.underline}, **[economic
conditions will be a crucial factor]{.underline}** in the election. As
the late president and prime minister Suleyman Demirel famously said:
"[There is no government which is able to resist the empty
pot."]{.underline} **[The pandemic hit Turkey\'s economy
severely]{.underline}**, as it has across the globe. [Inflation has also
recently increased across the world,]{.underline} **[but its effects
have been more negative in Turkey due to decreasing interest
rates.]{.underline}**

Moreover, the declaration opposes the "[exploitation of foreign policy

conduct military operations in Tal Rifaat and Manbij, and vocally
criticizing Greece's militarization of the Aegean islands. It goes
without saying that the government took those steps in line with the
principle of counterterrorism while keeping in mind the impact that the
Russian invasion of Ukraine has had on the regional balance of power as
well as the situation in Syria. Turkey must prevent the Iranian militias
from creating a new refugee wave, the evolution of the YPG Syrian
offshoot of the PKK into a state-like entity and the resurgence of
Daesh. In other words[, it makes no sense to associate that military
operation with "**electioneering**" or "**exploiting foreign policy for

#### Diversionary war theory is [bunk]{.underline}---there's no good data

Theories of Conflict: The Promises and Challenges of an Opportunities
Approach,\" International Studies 3-25-2021,

While a [consideration of international and dyadic contexts]{.underline}
as [opportunities for diversionary uses of force is]{.underline} an
[important]{.underline} part of the diversionary puzzle, **[there are
some key challenges with these considerations.]{.underline}** Overall,
one of the key challenges with scholarship on diversionary conflict is
that [it is extremely difficult to]{.underline}
"**[prove]{.underline}**" [that diversionary motives]{.underline} **[are
the primary cause of the use of force.]{.underline}** Th[e motives of
leaders,]{.underline} especially if they are diversionary in nature,
**[are not usually extremely transparent]{.underline}**. As such,
[scholars must make **assumptions** about motives]{.underline} based on
the best available information and situational contexts.

When considering the interplay between domestic problems and unrest,
domestic opportunities for diversion, and international or dyadic
contexts and opportunities for diversion, [it may be difficult
to]{.underline} **[specifically test diversionary
motives]{.underline}**. The fact that leaders consider both domestic and
international factors when making decisions is certainly not new, but
[only a **small number of**]{.underline} such
**[decisions]{.underline}** [are likely to be **motivated by
diversionary desires**]{.underline}. Large-n quantitative analyses can
help uncover patterns related to the connection between domestic factors
and international ones but may not be able to fully ascertain whether
diversionary motives were actually present in any given set of cases.
Mo[st large-n studies use measures of domestic unrest or
problems]{.underline}, such as protest, leader popularity, and economic
crises, [to help demonstrate diversionary motives]{.underline}, but
again, [there are likely cases within these data that appear
diversionary]{.underline} **[but really are not due to broad nature of
measures of diversionary motives.]{.underline}**

This [problem is **confounded further**]{.underline} [as more
opportunities---]{.underline}and particularly international
opportunities---[for diversionary uses of force **are added to the
mix.**]{.underline} In these cases, [international
opportunities]{.underline} for diversionary uses of force may [also
represent clear]{.underline} **[international security issues that
affect the national interests of a state]{.underline}**. As such, [it is
difficult to parse out conflicts that are occurring amidst both
international and domestic pressures from those that **have diversionary
motives**]{.underline}. This problem has yet to be fully explored within
the diversionary literature.

In fact, some of the research discounting diversionary tactics has
incorporated an international analysis, showing that these international
factors are more important than domestic ones for impacting
international conflict. For example, Meernik (1994) argued that, [while
some scholars previously found domestic political reasons to be
important motivations for the use of force]{.underline} by U.S.
presidents, [these studies fail to fully consider the **international
considerations**]{.underline} [that affected]{.underline} presidential
[decision-making]{.underline}. When international considerations, such
as the presence of an American military base, U.S. military aid, and
prior use of force, are considered, Meernik found that the [domestic
political conditions]{.underline} **[are no longer statistically
significant in affecting presidential decisions to use
force]{.underline}**. Instead, [presidents]{.underline} **[seemed to be
primarily motivated by these international conditions.]{.underline}**
Meernik found such [domestic considerations]{.underline} **[are not
important even in the face of international crises.]{.underline}**
Meernik's study suggested the importance of focusing on international
factors, but his analysis was limited only to the United States, and
thus the generalizability was unclear. Similarly, [DeRouen]{.underline}
(2000) also considered the U.S. use of diversionary force, while
controlling for international factors such as international crises and
Soviet/Russian crisis activity and interactions. The author [similarly
found **less support for diversionary tactics**]{.underline}, [and more
support for the fact that]{.underline} Soviet **[crisis activity, was a
major factor driving the use of force.]{.underline}** Like Meernik
(1994), these results suggested that, while international considerations
are important in discussions of diversionary conflict, in some
situations, when international factors are considered, diversionary
tactics no longer seem present. These [examples demonstrate]{.underline}
the **[difficulty in parsing out the role of diversion as a motive in
conflict.]{.underline}**

The fact that [many of the international opportunities that are linked
to diversionary incentives]{.underline}, such as territorial disputes
and rivalry, [are also situations where wars are most
likely,]{.underline} also **[makes it difficult to fully tease out the
role of diversion.]{.underline}** Another challenge with focusing on
opportunities, particularly international ones, is that [domestic
problems]{.underline} (like economic crises) [could be linked to the
actions of other states]{.underline} (including rivals), [and thus could
represent **legitimate grievances**]{.underline} between states and
grounds for potential armed conflicts. The conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea provides an example---where the economic crisis that Eritrea
experienced was directly related to actions taken by the Ethiopian
government (Butcher & Maru, 2018). In these cases, it becomes very
difficult to disentangle traditional measures of domestic problems used
as indicators of potential diversionary motives with other types of
national security motives for imitating conflicts.

### 1AR --- AT: Diversionary War Theory

#### Studies are [at best]{.underline} uncertain

Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Holger Albrecht, \"Diversionary Peace:
International Peacekeeping and Domestic Civil-Military Relations,\"

To introduce an important caveat, [the research programme on
diversionary war]{.underline} **[hardly ever presents robust
evidence]{.underline}** for the fact that a decision to go to war was
prompted mainly by an incumbent's intent to coup-proof. While
intentionality is uncertain, scholars found empirically that war reduces
the likelihood of military coups in autocracies.16 Cemal Eren Arbatli
and Ekim Arbatli most forcefully described the mechanisms believed to
underlie the effects that a military's engagement in war has on coup
risk.17 For one, the 'rally-around-the-flag mechanism' implies the
emergence of a public cry for national unity at the time of war,
increased political support for executive office holders, and hence less
support for a coup among officers and the broader public. For another,
the 'feasibility mechanism' means that a military's deployment abroad
reduces the organizational and combat capacities necessary to undertake
a coup attempt. Finally, the 'credible commitment mechanism' implies
that an increased external threat catalyzed through a militarized
dispute substantiates the importance of the military in politics and
society more broadly. Hence, the military's political and economic
interests would most likely be sustained as a consequence of its role as
a 'savior' of nation and state, rather than an ordinary power grab.

[Arguments assuming a connection between war and the reduced likelihood
of coups are intuitively compelling and have received some empirical
support]{.underline}. **[Yet, quantitative tests of the effect of
diversionary wars suffer from methodological challenges]{.underline}**
that, at least in part, explain inconclusive results in existing
studies.18 What has largely gone unnoticed is a [problem related to the
selection of the universe of empirical cases]{.underline}. In fact,
[many systematic studies in diversionary war theory]{.underline}
[disguise an empirical blind spot:]{.underline} **[not all states have a
credible threat at challenging their neighbours, let alone to going to
war,]{.underline}** for their own limitations in military strength
and/or their neighbour's superior firepower. It does not make much sense
to assume that incumbents in a small country, with military capacities
vastly inferior to those of its adversaries, would even consider going
to war for coup-proofing. While a stake in international conflict might
generate an initial rallying-around-the-flag effect at home, **[almost
certain defeat in war reduces the likelihood of authoritarian leaders to
stay in office]{.underline}**.19

Empirically, [proponents of diversionary war theory
therefore]{.underline} **[often ignore relative military
strength]{.underline}** as [an important context factor fo]{.underline}r
the assumed effects of war on coup-proofing. Theoretically, however, it
remains an inspiring point of departure to explore alternative
strategies in foreign policy decisions and their possible effects on
domestic civil-military relations. While war may not always be an
option, opportunities may appear for weak states to link foreign policy
making to coup-proofing: the diversionary peace.20 In a nutshell, I
argue that participation in peacekeeping missions abroad produces
similar effects for coup-proofing as diversionary wars. As an added
benefit, participation in peacekeeping operations avoids the risk for
incumbents associated with losing a war. Rather, the humanitarian nature
of peacekeeping missions allows politicians to claim additional support
from both their own populace and the international community.

[Greece\'s armed forces are on high alert]{.underline} in the Eastern
Aegean Sea as tensions escalate with Turkey. [Officials have been
responding to what they say are mounting provocations by Turkey\'s
leadership.]{.underline}

Senior Greek Defense Ministry sources say the [military intelligence
they have gathered point to the prospect of so-called hybrid
threats]{.underline} that Greece may face from its neighbor Turkey as
the two NATO allies compete for oil and gas drilling rights in contested
parts of the Aegean and Mediterranean seas.

The [points of friction between the two countries are many.]{.underline}

A crisis, the sources say, may also spring from a sudden surge in
refugee flows from Turkey, or from unexpected wildfires in remote
locations or islands in the Aegean Sea that [Turkey wants to see
demilitarized]{.underline}.

Some [security analysts say that while Turkey\'s recent
actions]{.underline} - including the bellicose remarks of its leader -
[are serious]{.underline}, **[an armed conflict is
unlikely]{.underline}**. Retired General Leonidas Tzoumis said [both
countries **stand to lose from a military confrontation**]{.underline},
but he warned that Turkish actions may lead to a miscalculation. That
prospect, he said, requires heightened vigilance by Greece\'s armed
forces.

Tzoumis said [Greece is facing]{.underline} what he calls a **[classic
Turkish game of controlled escalation,]{.underline}** [one of repeated
provocations that can trigger a serious enough incident that would
eventually force Greece to negotiate matters]{.underline} like the
Aegean Sea dispute and territorial rights that Greece has been refusing
to discuss because - the analyst said - it does not want to cede an
inch.

### 2AC --- Erdogan Bad Turn

#### Erdogan's [consolidation of power]{.underline} causes Turkish adventurism and miscalculation---there are [no checks]{.underline}

[Erdogan's centralisation of power]{.underline}

[Turkey's assertive defence of the interests]{.underline} noted above
[has run]{.underline} **[parallel to the growing concentration of
power]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[Erdogan's]{.underline}**
[hands]{.underline}. For example, [the first Turkish military
operation]{.underline} in Syria in August 2016 [came after Erdogan had
declared a domestic state of emergency]{.underline} and initiated a
massive purge of the officer corps following the failed coup attempt in
July, the origins of which are still largely unexplained. In June 2015,
even though its once considerable political influence was already
waning, the Turkish armed forces had defied an order from Erdogan to
draw up plans for a military incursion into Syria.

[Erdogan renewed the state of emergency every three months until July
2018]{.underline}, when he [introduced a de facto executive presidential
system]{.underline} that was formalised by changing the Turkish
constitution. [The concentration of executive power]{.underline} **[in
Erdogan's hands]{.underline}** [has been accompanied by the
personalisation **and de-institutionalisation of foreign
policy**]{.underline}, [the formulation and implementation of which are
now shaped]{.underline} **[by his abrasive character.]{.underline}**
[Expert input]{.underline} into the formulation of foreign policy **[has
been significantly reduced:]{.underline}** [decisions are now made by
Erdogan]{.underline} **[in the relative isolation of consultations with
a small circle of advisers]{.underline}** [chosen on the basis of
loyalty rather than experience or expertise.]{.underline} There has been
a similar shift in the conduct of foreign policy. The role played by
institutions -- including the Ministry for Foreign Affairs itself, which
previously conducted discreet and detailed negotiations -- has
diminished. Erdogan prefers instead to have one-to-one meetings and
telephone conversations with other heads of government -- and often
suddenly announces major policy shifts during his daily public
appearances on national television.

[Erdogan's long-running domination]{.underline} [of Turkish domestic
politics may have]{.underline} **[fuelled a belief that he could act
with similar assertiveness abroad.]{.underline}** US President Donald
Trump has been willing to accommodate him in many areas, permitting the
October 2019 Turkish incursion into Syria against the SDF, Washington's
main partner in its war against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or
ISIL). The European Union has been reluctant to take concrete action
against him, such as by suspending or cancelling Turkey's accession
negotiations, despite factors that should weigh against accession:
growing domestic repression, including prosecutions of journalists and
other critics in civil society; his encouragement of refugees and
migrants to breach Greece's border in late February 2020; and his
aggressive assertion of maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean.
Even though Ankara's relations with Moscow have been strained by the two
countries' support for opposing sides in the civil wars first in Syria
and now in Libya, Erdogan still seems confident that he can defuse a
potential crisis through direct talks with President Vladimir Putin. He
appears to hold the rather questionable view that the EU, Russia and the
US all need Turkey more than it needs them.

[Erdogan's]{.underline} more **[assertive foreign policy]{.underline}**
i[s also underpinned by the recent development of the Turkish defence
industry,]{.underline} **[including its production of weapons, armoured
vehicles and, above all, drones]{.underline}**. Virtually all of the
military aid that Ankara is providing to the GNA in Libya and rebel
forces in Syria has been manufactured in Turkey -- thus significantly
reducing the inherent constraints, such as the risk of sanctions or
interruptions in supplies, that Ankara faced when it was heavily
dependent on sourcing arms and equipment from abroad. (However, it is
still dependent on other countries for the supply of major military
equipment, such as aircraft.) In southeast Turkey and northern Iraq, the
deployment of Turkishmade drones has resulted in a shift in the balance
of power on the battlefield, enabling Ankara to contain, though not
eradicate, the PKK's insurgency. Turkishmade drones have also been
deployed in Syria and Libya. Earlier this year they played an important
role in the GNA first halting and then driving back an offensive by the
LNA. In Libya in particular, the development of the [Turkish defence
industry has also brought Erdogan political advantages,]{.underline}
[enabling him to project power while avoiding the risk of high
casualties]{.underline} -- and domestic repercussions -- that would have
accompanied the commitment of large numbers of Turkish troops.

[What role has Erdogan played?]{.underline}

[Erdogan and his AKP]{.underline}, **[a conservative party with Islamist
roots]{.underline}**, [came to power]{.underline} in 2002, [following a
decade marked by political instability]{.underline} and a financial
crisis. The AKP advanced economic and political reforms to bring Turkey
closer in line with EU standards, and the country's economy grew by 7.5
percent on average annually between 2001 and 2011. On foreign policy,
the AKP's motto was "zero problems with neighbors," and Ankara aimed to
expand Turkey's influence by building trade ties, encouraging democracy,
and emphasizing its Islamic identity.

But by the late 2000s, the [AKP]{.underline} had **[become more
authoritarian]{.underline}**. It [consolidated control over media
organizations, purged the military of perceived dissidents, prosecuted
and jailed critics, and quashed protests]{.underline}. In 2016, Erdogan
seized on an attempted military coup to crack down further on his
perceived opponents, who he alleges are led by Fethullah Gulen, a cleric
living in exile in the United States who was once Erdogan's ally.
Through a referendum the following year, [Erdogan replaced the country's
parliamentary system with a presidential one;]{.underline} abolished the
office of prime minister, among other major changes; and [effectively
rendered himself Turkey's sole power holder.]{.underline}

[Erdogan has engineered an]{.underline} **[assertive shift in foreign
policy]{.underline}** [that focuses on]{.underline} **[expanding
Turkey's military]{.underline}** and diplomatic footprint. To this end,
[Turkey has launched **military interventions**]{.underline} [in
countries including]{.underline} **[Azerbaijan, Iraq, Libya, and
Syria]{.underline}**; [supplied partners such as Ethiopia and Ukraine
with drones]{.underline}; and built Islamic schools abroad.
