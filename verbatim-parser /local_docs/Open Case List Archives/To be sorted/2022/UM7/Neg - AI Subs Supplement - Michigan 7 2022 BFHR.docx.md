[[In]{.mark} the game of [chess, there's a concept called \"**forced
mate**]{.mark}.\" The term refers to one side maneuvering its pieces to
guarantee victory in a set number of moves, regardless of what the
opponent does.]{.underline} On Feb. 11, representatives of the Chinese
and Taiwanese government met in the mainland Chinese city of Nanjing.
Expected to produce few, if any breakthroughs, the symbolism of the
event is still great: It is their [first formal
meeting](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/world/asia/china-and-taiwan-hold-first-official-talks-since-civil-war.html)
in 65 years. Since the Nationalists fled to Taiwan at the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949, Beijing has viewed the island as a renegade
province and has made its \"reunification with the motherland\" a
paramount objective. Tensions have occasionally flared: As recently as
the 1990s, China
[lobbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis)
missiles into the strait between the mainland and Taiwan, Taiwanese
politicians threatened to declare independence, and the United States
moved two aircraft carrier groups into the region. Today, however, [the
link between mainland China and the self-governing entity of 23 million
people just 110 miles off its eastern coast is warmer than it's ever
been]{.underline}, even as Taiwan continues to insist on its rights as a
self-governing body. So if China makes the right moves, and continues to
successfully and peacefully draw Taiwan into its orbit, can it create a
\"forced mate\" situation? [Beijing has been making Taipei an offer it
can't refuse: a readily accessible market of **1.3 billion
people**.]{.underline} In arguably its greatest foreign policy success
over the last decade, Beijing has been taking a patient and long-term
approach toward the island, offering sweetheart economic deals and a
reduction of military rhetoric (though China still maintains an
estimated 1,600 missiles
[aimed](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/10/09/2003574061)
across the strait) while isolating Taiwan internationally. The 2008
election in Taiwan of Ma Ying-jeou, the head of the Kuomintang Party,
helped: Ma's party favors closer ties with China, unlike the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which ran Taiwan for the previous
eight years. After Ma took power, Beijing visibly softened toward
Taiwan, authorizing a series of economic deals that were favorable to
the island, like the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA),
which reduced tariffs. \"We can give up our profits because Taiwanese
compatriots are our brothers,\"
[said](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10442557) then-Premier Wen Jiabao. In
June 2008, the two sides
[agreed](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/business/worldbusiness/04iht-04fly.14224270.html)
to begin direct tourist flights, and, in December of that year, they
[started](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/news/15iht-15TAIWAN.18675854.html)
direct shipping traffic and mail service. Some 2.85 million Chinese
nationals
[visited](http://news.yahoo.com/record-2-85-million-chinese-visited-taiwan-2013-171651510.html)
Taiwan in 2013, up 10 percent from the year before (more than
[double](http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/01/05/397603/Taiwan-sees.htm)
the number coming from Japan, the second-largest source of visitors).
And in 2013, bilateral trade
[reached](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-28/taiwan-china-government-officials-to-meet-feb-11-for-first-time.html)
\$197.2 billion, up nearly 100 percent from when Ma was elected.
Bloomberg, citing government statistics, reported that, today, roughly
40 percent of Taiwan's exports head to China. Many analysts now see this
as the endgame. \"[Cross-strait interdependence has been an
**irreversible process**, at least in **economic**, **social** and
**cultural terms**]{.underline},\" notes Titus C. Chen, an associate
research fellow at the National Chengchi University in Taipei. He adds,
\"[The prospects of Taiwan can no longer be separated from those of
China]{.underline}.\" When asked about the chess analogy, June Teufel
Dreyer, an expert on China's international relations at the University
of Miami, offered a different one instead. \"[There's a type of insect
that a horde of ants will attack. The ants lay their eggs in the insect,
and then eat it,\" Dreyer says. \"That's what happening with Taiwan.\"
While [Taiwan]{.mark} has become closer to China, it [has]{.mark} also
[grown **more isolated** from the rest of the world]{.mark}. Only 21
nations
[recognize](http://www.dw.de/taiwans-diplomatic-charm-offensive/a-17380254)
Taiwan]{.underline}, the largest of which is the poor African nation of
Burkina Faso, which has a population of 15 million. The Holy See
recognizes Taiwan, but it's the only European state to do so. (Taiwan is
not a member of the United Nations and
[participates](http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/chinese_taipei_e.htm)
in the World Health Organization as a \"separate customs territory.\")
Taiwan strives, and mostly fails, to attend international summits. In
September 2013, I received an e-mail from the U.S. Taiwan Economic and
Cultural Representative Office, Taiwan's embassy-like presence in
Washington, crowing that Taiwan \"has been invited to attend the 38th
session of the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly for
the first time since losing its ICAO seat in 1971.\" Washington,
Taiwan's most important ally, has long said it recognizes that there is
only one China, and that it hopes Beijing and Taipei can peacefully
resolve their differences. \"The administration is very supportive of
improved cross-strait relations,\" says a senior U.S. defense official,
who asked to speak on background. The United States has
[sold](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL30957.pdf) tens of billions
of dollars of arms to Taiwan over the last few decades, though the
number has dropped recently. \"The United States makes available to
Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable Taiwan to
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,\" says Jeff Pool, a
Pentagon spokesman. [U.S. policy toward Taiwan is often described as
\"**strategic ambiguity**]{.underline}\" --- [not stating if America
will or will not defend Taiwan if China seizes it by force. There is
great strategic and symbolic value to the United States maintaining its
alliance with Taiwan. But the status of Taiwan matters far less to
Washington]{.underline}, and to Americans, than it does to Beijing and
the Chinese. \"[There's the Inevitability Theory]{.underline},\" says
Mark Stokes, the executive director of the Project 2049 think tank,
which focuses on security in Asia, and a former U.S. defense official.
\"[[Beijing says it's inevitable]{.mark} \[that [the two sides]{.mark}\]
[will fulfill **reunification**]{.mark} on China's terms, [and they
actually believe it]{.mark}]{.underline}. The idea is: If Taiwan is
going to be eaten up by China anyway, why do we want to risk the
trouble?\" Inevitable or not, [Beijing still faces the challenge of
convincing Taiwan that unification is beneficial]{.underline} --- and
convincing its own people that patience continues to be the best
strategy. For the last 20 years, most Taiwanese have
[favored](http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/english/modules/tinyd2/content/tonduID.htm)
the tenuous status quo over declaring independence or reunifying with
the mainland, according to data from the Election Study Center at the
National Chengchi University in Taiwan. From 2012 to 2013, the number of
Taiwanese wanting to maintain the status quo but eventually move toward
independence rose from 15.1 percent to 17.9 percent, while 2.1 percent
wanted immediate unification. This may be a gain for the
pro-independence side, but roughly 58 percent of Taiwanese still don't
want things to change. These numbers are far less favorable to China
than the most relevant comparison: Britain's return of Hong Kong to the
mainland in 1997. In February 1993, 42 percent of Hong Kongers
[wanted](http://www.hktp.org/list/first_5_yrs.pdf) to join China, while
25 percent wanted independence, according to the Hong Kong Transition
Project, a research organization. In the weeks before the handover, as
people adjusted to the new reality, those numbers changed to 53 and 17
percent, respectively. But Beijing and London agreed to return Hong Kong
in 1984; the mainland had 13 years of preparation to make it palatable.
[As China and Taiwan continue to move closer together, Beijing may feel
like it lacks the luxury of time it had with Hong Kong]{.underline}.
\"The political pressures on the Chinese government when it comes to
Taiwan are tremendous and growing. In the past, Chinese people knew that
China was weak and could not stop the United States from selling weapons
to Taiwan. Now many believe that China should no longer tolerate such
insulting behavior,\" wrote Jia Qingguo, associate dean at the school of
international studies at Peking University, in the 2014 book Debating
China. \"[Because national unification is an important source of
political legitimacy, the \[Communist Party\] could face a serious
domestic **political crisis** if it does not handle the Taiwan issue
deftly]{.underline}.\" Xi Jinping, China's most powerful and assertive
leader in decades, may be keen on resolving the issue once and for all.
In October 2013, Xi
[said](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013xiapec/2013-10/06/content_17011186.htm)
the problems caused by the cross-strait issue should not be handed on
from generation to generation. \"The question is, was Xi shifting away
from \[his predecessor\] Hu Jintao's policy of patience?\" asks Alan D.
Romberg, director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center and a
former State Department official. Internationally, too, the timing is
propitious. As tensions increase between China and its neighbors over
territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, \"this has
diverted the attention away from Taiwan --- very few people talk about
it anymore,\" says Stokes. (Both China and Taiwan agree that the Diaoyu,
the disputed islands that Japan administers and calls the Senkaku,
belong to Taiwan. The only marked difference between China's and
Taiwan's claim is who owns Taiwan.) There's increased pressure to make
progress before Ma --- who will likely be succeeded by a less
China-friendly politician --- leaves office in 2016. So what will China
do? Beijing's representative at the Feb. 11 meeting, Zhang Zhijun,
[said](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/uk-china-taiwan-idUKBREA1A0G920140211)
both sides should have \"a little more imagination\" without
elaborating. The only concrete takeaway so far is that both sides have
agreed to set up representative offices \"as soon as possible,\" though
it is unclear when. One thing \"imagination\" probably does not mean is
war: It is extremely unlikely that China will invade Taiwan in the near
term. The mountainous island would have a lot of advantages in that
fight. The Taiwanese could focus on asymmetrical capabilities, good
beach defenses, and smaller units that are difficult to target. Even if
the United States decided not to intervene, a Chinese victory would not
be assured. In October 2013, Taiwan released a national defense report
[stating](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/10/09/2003574061)
that Beijing would be able to mount a comprehensive cross-strait
offensive by 2020. If China were to succeed in a military campaign
against Taiwan, it would create a tremendous amount of resentment, not
only in Taiwan, but around the region --- belying Beijing's assertion
that China's rise will be peaceful. [Ultimately, China will win if it
can convince Taiwan to give in without a fight: through economic
cooperation, technology sharing, and, if Beijing can improve its image,
a chance for Taiwan to be a part of greater China]{.underline}. \"The
whole point of China's policy is to try to create an environment where
people in Taiwan want to unify,\" said Romberg. [For Taiwan, [the
**greatest danger** is not]{.mark} **military [attack]{.mark}**[, but
that Beijing \"might]{.mark} exploit its growing power to '[**intimidate
Taiwan into submission'**]{.mark} on China's terms]{.underline},\"
Richard Bush, a former head of the American Institute of Taiwan, the
private corporation that manages U.S. interests on the island,
[said](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/01/16/2003581393)
in January, according to the newspaper Taipei Times. Chen of National
Chengchi University believes \"[the only option]{.underline} --- indeed
a risky one --- [is to **engage China**, further integrate into her
economic and social systems, and change her political and ideological
architecture from within]{.underline}.\" A liberalized or democratic
China would treat Taiwan differently --- but drastic political change in
Beijing is unlikely. \"[Barring an unexpected event, the prospects for
**continued independence** in Taiwan **do not look good**,\" Dreyer
says. [As China continues to **expand** ]{.mark}**in influence**[, the
world increasingly sees the Middle Kingdom]{.mark}, rather than the
United States, [as the future. When large numbers of Taiwanese]{.mark}
begin to [do]{.mark} the same, **[that's
checkmate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Why do great powers fight great wars? The conventional answer is
a]{.underline} story of rising challengers and declining hegemons. [An
ascendant power]{.underline}, which chafes at the rules of the existing
order, [gains ground on an established power]{.underline}---the country
that made those rules. [Tensions multiply; tests of strength ensue. The
outcome is a spiral of fear and hostility leading, almost inevitably, to
conflict. "]{.underline}The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm
which this inspired in Sparta, made war inevitable," the ancient
historian Thucydides wrote---a truism now invoked, ad nauseum, in
explaining the U.S.-China rivalry.

[[The]{.mark} idea of a [Thucydides Trap]{.mark}]{.underline},
popularized by Harvard political scientist Graham Allison, [holds that
the danger of war will skyrocket as a surging China overtakes a sagging
America]{.underline}. Even Chinese President Xi Jinping has endorsed the
concept arguing Washington must make room for Beijing. [As tensions
between the United States and China escalate, the **belief that the
fundamental cause of friction is a looming "power
transition**]{.underline}"---the replacement of one hegemon by
another---[has become canonical]{.underline}.

[**The only problem** with this familiar formula **[is]{.mark}** that
**it's [wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The Thucydides Trap]{.underline} doesn't really explain what caused the
Peloponnesian War. It [**doesn't capture the dynamics** **that have
often driven revisionist powers**]{.underline}---whether that is Germany
in 1914 or Japan in 1941---[to start some of history's most devastating
conflicts]{.underline}. [And **it doesn't explain why war is a very real
possibility in U.S.-China relations today**]{.underline} [because it
**fundamentally misdiagnoses where China now finds itself on its arc of
development**]{.underline}---the point at which its relative power is
peaking and will soon start to fade.

[There's indeed a deadly trap that could ensnare the United States and
China.]{.underline} But it's not the product of a power transition the
Thucydidean cliché says it is. [It's **best thought of instead as a
"peaking power trap."**]{.underline} And if history is any guide,
**[[it's China's]{.mark}---not the United States'---[impending decline
that could cause it to snap]{.mark} shut.]{.underline}**

The retreat of the Athenians from Syracuse in the Peloponnesian War

There is an entire swath of literature, known as "power transition
theory," which holds that great-power war typically occurs at the
intersection of one hegemon's rise and another's decline. This is the
body of work underpinning the Thucydides Trap, and there is, admittedly,
an elemental truth to the idea. The rise of new powers is invariably
destabilizing. In the runup to the Peloponnesian War in the 5th century
B.C., Athens would not have seemed so menacing to Sparta had it not
built a vast empire and become a naval superpower. Washington and
Beijing would not be locked in rivalry if China was still poor and weak.
Rising powers do expand their influence in ways that threaten reigning
powers.

But the calculus that produces war---particularly [the [calculus]{.mark}
that [pushes]{.mark} revisionist [powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, countries
seeking to shake up the existing system, [[to lash out
violently]{.mark}---is more complex.]{.underline} [A country whose
relative wealth and power are growing will surely become more assertive
and ambitious.]{.underline} All things equal, it will seek greater
global influence and prestige. **[But [if its position is]{.mark}
steadily [improving]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[[it should postpone
a]{.mark} deadly [showdown]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[with the]{.mark}
reigning [hegemon]{.mark}]{.underline}** [until it has become even
stronger]{.underline}. [Such a country should follow the dictum former
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping laid down]{.underline} for a rising China
after the Cold War: [It should hide its capabilities and bide its
time.]{.underline}

Now **[imagine a different scenario]{.underline}**. [**A dissatisfied
state** has been building its power]{.underline} and expanding its
geopolitical horizons. **[But then the country peaks]{.underline}**,
[perhaps **because its economy slows**, perhaps because its **own
assertiveness provokes a coalition**]{.underline} **[of determined
rivals,]{.underline}** or perhaps because both of these things happen at
once. The future starts to look quite forbidding; a sense of imminent
danger starts to replace a feeling of limitless possibility. [In these
circumstances, [a revisionist power **may**]{.mark} **[act]{.mark}
[boldly]{.mark}, even aggressively**, **[to grab what it can]{.mark}
before it is too late**.]{.underline} The most dangerous trajectory in
world politics is a long rise followed by the prospect of a sharp
decline.

As we show in our forthcoming book, Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict
with China, this scenario is more common than you might think. Historian
Donald Kagan showed, for instance, that [Athens started acting more
belligerently in the years before the Peloponnesian War because it
feared adverse shifts in the balance of naval power]{.underline}---[in
other words, because it was **on the verge of losing influence**
vis-à-vis Sparta]{.underline}. We see the same thing in more recent
cases as well.

**[Over the past 150 years]{.underline}**, [peaking
powers]{.underline}---[great powers that had been growing dramatically
faster]{.underline} than the world average **[and then suffered a
severe, prolonged slowdown]{.underline}**---[usually **don't fade away
quietly**]{.underline}. Rather, [they become **brash and
aggressive**]{.underline}. They suppress dissent at home and try to
regain economic momentum by creating exclusive spheres of influence
abroad. They pour money into their militaries and use force to expand
their influence. This behavior commonly provokes great-power tensions.
In some cases, it touches disastrous wars.

This shouldn't be surprising. Eras of rapid growth supercharge a
country's ambitions, raise its people's expectations, and make its
rivals nervous. During a sustained economic boom, businesses enjoy
rising profits and citizens get used to living large. The country
becomes a bigger player on the global stage. Then stagnation strikes.

[Slowing growth **makes it harder for leaders to keep the public
happy**]{.underline}. Economic underperformance weakens the country
against its rivals[. [**Fearing upheaval**, **leaders crack down on
dissent**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [They **[maneuver]{.mark} desperately
[to keep]{.mark} geopolitical [enemies at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Expansion seems like a solution]{.underline}---[a way of grabbing
economic resources and markets, making nationalism a crutch for a
wounded regime, and beating back foreign threats]{.underline}.

**[2NC -- AT: Military Confrontation Inevitable]{.underline}**

**Xi has signaled that while force [isn't]{.underline} off the table,
China prefers unification through economic integration**

**Chang 20** -- a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Graduate Institute of East
Asian Studies at National Chengchi University Chia-Chien Chang and Alan
H. Yang, "Weaponized Interdependence: China\'s Economic Statecraft and
Social Penetration against Taiwan," Orbis, 2020,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102596/

[On January 2, 2019]{.underline}, Chinese leader [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping
[delivered a speech]{.mark}]{.underline} on the 40 th Anniversary of the
Issuance of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, [[unveiling]{.mark}
the People\'s Republic of China\'s **primary [strategies
toward]{.mark}** the Republic of China]{.underline}
(**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**). In the speech, [Xi stated that the
[reunification]{.mark} of Taiwan [is the foundation for Chin]{.mark}a\'s
national rejuvenation]{.underline} and the "China dream." To fulfill
China\'s ambition, [Xi emphasized, China will not renounce the use of
force]{.underline} and will reserve the option of taking all necessary
measures. **[More importantly]{.underline}**, [[China will be eager to
**promote the reunification** **through**]{.mark} **a variety of
means**]{.underline}, [including institutionalizing **cross-Strait
[trade and]{.mark} economic [coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline},
**[creating a common market]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark} granting
[favored treatment to "compatriots" in Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Furthermore, [China is seeking [to influence public opinion]{.mark} in
Taiwan]{.underline} by "forging closer bonds of heart and mind" through
various social exchanges and communication. [Xi\'s speech reveals
that]{.underline}, in a world of interdependence, [both
[economic]{.mark} statecraft [and social penetration have become]{.mark}
two [crucial strategies for China]{.mark} to expand its sphere of
influence over Taiwan.]{.underline}

Xi\'s policy statement is just the tip of the iceberg for China\'s
broader socio-economic statecraft. Economic globalization and
technological revolution have created various forms of global
connectivity, including trade, investment, infrastructure, digital, and
people-to-people connectivity. Those interconnections not only
facilitate China\'s national development, but they also enable Beijing
to conduct comprehensive economic manipulation and social penetration
all over the world. For instance, China curtailed the import of Japanese
autos in 2012 to protest Japan\'s policy toward the Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands. China also banned the import of Philippine bananas to retaliate
against the Philippines' policy regarding the South China Sea dispute.
In 2017, to signal its disapproval of Seoul\'s decision to accept the
U.S. bid to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
system, the Chinese government halted Chinese group tours to South Korea
and implicitly supported a domestic boycott of South Korean goods. In
addition, China has provided significant financial assistance to
countries in Africa and Latin America in exchange for their support.
Furthermore, Beijing has launched numerous social exchange programs
worldwide, including cultural, educational, professional, journalistic,
and think-tank exchanges. Those programs usually include
all-expenses-paid events, job opportunities (offered by Chinese
companies), and financial rewards. They help cultivate an international
group for China\'s "Grand External Propaganda" (大外宣, dà wài xuān)
China\'s global strategy of public diplomacy. Finally, as senior fellow
and director of China strategy at the Brookings Rush Doshi points out,
China is attempting to utilize its financial muscle and technology to
influence every stage of global information supply chains.

Clearly, [[China\'s economic]{.mark} [statecraft]{.mark} and social
penetration [are **different from using coercive hard power**]{.mark}
**based on brute force**]{.underline}. They should not be considered as
"soft power," a notion Harvard scholar Joseph Nye uses to describe the
power of attraction based on values, culture, institutions, and
policies. [In essence, [China seeks to manipulate the target]{.mark}
country [by creating]{.mark} economic [dependence]{.mark} and by
penetrating the target\'s society]{.underline}. China is certainly not
the first country to embrace these strategies. [What makes it
special]{.underline}, however, [is how China uses its position in the
global networks in conducting this sort of statecraft]{.underline}.
China exploits global connectivity and weaponizes interdependence
between countries, creating the structural foundation of its economic
statecraft and social-penetration operations.

The third strategic consideration for Beijing is that its
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} say they [[remain]{.underline}
[committed]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[to peaceful
reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a televised speech at the 110th

reunification is in the mainland and Taiwan's best interests.

At a press conference last month during the National People's Congress,
[Li pledged to advance]{.underline} [peaceful]{.underline} growth in
[relations with Taiwan]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
"[reunification]{.underline}", though he also stressed that China
remained firmly opposed to [separatist

[[on maintaining peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cross-strait

logic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Chinese history, civil
[wars]{.underline} [are]{.underline} often [associated]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [turbulence and chaos.]{.underline}

An illustrative example is the Chinese civil war fought between the
Communists and Nationalists. Under the mantra that Chinese people should
not fight against their own, the Communist Party criticised the ruling
Nationalist government for throwing the country into the cauldron of
civil war and bringing more suffering to the people.

Back then, the mantra represented people's anti-war sentiment and
explained why the Nationalist government gradually lost the hearts and
minds of the Chinese people. Showing aggression against your own
compatriots, therefore, would be morally wrong and politically unviable.
The Communist Party would be careful not to follow in the Nationalist
government's footsteps.

[[Peaceful]{.mark} [reunification]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[lend
greater credence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to Beijing's
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} [[at projecting an
image]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as a benign]{.underline}]{.mark},
responsible [[global power]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would also help to
bring clarity to China's intentions and ambitions.

[China's]{.underline} image [problem]{.underline}, [the need for

The third strategic consideration for Beijing is that its
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} say they [[remain]{.underline}
[committed]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[to peaceful
reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a televised speech at the 110th
anniversary of China's 1911 revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty
and turned China into a republic,
Xi [said](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3151755/chinese-president-xi-jinping-says-peaceful-reunification-taiwan?module=inline&pgtype=article) peaceful
reunification is in the mainland and Taiwan's best interests.

At a press conference last month during the National People's Congress,
[Li pledged to advance]{.underline} [peaceful]{.underline} growth in
[relations with Taiwan]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
"[reunification]{.underline}", though he also stressed that China
remained firmly opposed to [separatist
activities](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3152544/will-beijing-sharpen-its-laws-punish-taiwan-separatists?module=inline&pgtype=article) and
foreign interference.

Chinese [[leaders']{.underline}]{.mark} [[emphasis]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[on maintaining peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cross-strait
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[carries historical
logic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Chinese history, civil
[wars]{.underline} [are]{.underline} often [associated]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [turbulence and chaos.]{.underline}

An illustrative example is the Chinese civil war fought between the
Communists and Nationalists. Under the mantra that Chinese people should
not fight against their own, the Communist Party criticised the ruling
Nationalist government for throwing the country into the cauldron of
civil war and bringing more suffering to the people.

Back then, the mantra represented people's anti-war sentiment and
explained why the Nationalist government gradually lost the hearts and
minds of the Chinese people. Showing aggression against your own
compatriots, therefore, would be morally wrong and politically unviable.
The Communist Party would be careful not to follow in the Nationalist
government's footsteps.

[[Peaceful]{.mark} [reunification]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[lend
greater credence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to Beijing's
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} [[at projecting an
image]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as a benign]{.underline}]{.mark},
responsible [[global power]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would also help to
bring clarity to China's intentions and ambitions.

[China's]{.underline} image [problem]{.underline}, [the need for
stability]{.underline} to address domestic woes and the weight of
history **[should weigh on Beijing's strategic
calculations]{.underline}**. These should caution Chinese leaders
against an invasion of Taiwan. Reunification with Taiwan is just one of
many priorities and issues that leaders in Zhongnanhai have on their
agenda.

However, **[[the above strategic]{.mark}
[considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[would only work]{.mark}
[barring]{.mark} any [unexpected geopolitical
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}** or crises [[that might exhaust
China's]{.underline}]{.mark} [[patience]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[or

[In the tunnels of the]{.underline} "[Underground Great
Wall]{.underline}" [are stacked hundreds of **nuclear
ICBMs**]{.underline}, hidden from the eyes of the world.
[This]{.underline} 5,000 kilometer passageway [is]{.underline} just one
[part of China's plan to **modernize** and increase the
size]{.underline}, [power]{.underline}, [and efficiency of
its]{.underline} already gargantuan [military]{.underline}. [In
2019]{.underline}, [the People's Liberation Army's annual defense budget
was]{.underline} 1.19 trillion yuan (\$177.5 billion), [up 7.5 percent
from last year's defense budget]{.underline}. [[China is
allocating]{.mark} **increasing amounts** of [money to
programs]{.mark}]{.underline} and initiatives [[that increase the
**quantity** and **quality** of]{.mark} their military
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Defense Department claims that one of
its most recent developments --- the New Type 055 guided missile
destroyer --- is akin to the United States' marine destroyers.
Additionally, the PLA is growing its stockpile of nuclear weapons. Dean
Cheng, an expert in the Chinese military at the Heritage Foundation,
commented in an interview with the HPR that "China's ICBM force
currently is very limited, maybe 50. But there are reports ... that
suggest that [China is engaged with a longer term nuclear modernization
program that will also expand the number of nuclear weapons it
fields]{.underline}." In April 2017, Beijing announced that one of its
aircraft carriers had reached the final stage of testing, with two
others under production. That would bring China to a total of four
aircraft carriers by 2022. [Though this may not compare to the U.S.
Navy]{.underline}'s 10 functional aircraft carriers --- out of a fleet
of 19 deployable carriers --- [this]{.underline} **[rapid
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} [[indicate China's
commitment to]{.mark} quickly expand and [modernize its army]{.mark} in
order [to **protect**]{.mark} its **[national
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} and weaken the United States' influence
in Asia. Competition in the South China Sea Part of the reason for the
PLA's rapid military modernization effort seems to be its interest in
maintaining authority in the South China Sea by decreasing U.S.
influence there. The South China Sea is a long-contested territory; in
1947, China announced its eleven-dash policy (which it amended in the
1950s to a "nine-dash" policy), declaring Chinese jurisdiction over
almost 90 percent of the Sea. However, the nine-dash policy is not
internationally recognized, and China's territorial claims overlap with
the competing claims advanced by five other countries bordering the
South China Sea. The South China Sea connects China to Africa and
Europe, allowing the People's Republic to efficiently transport its
exports. Over 40 percent of China's trade is transported through the Sea
because of its easy access to global markets. ChinaPower estimated that
if the Strait of Malacca, a thin strip of water that creates a path to
Europe and Africa from Asia, was blocked due to alternate South China
Sea borders, Chinese transporters would pay an additional \$64.5 million
per week. The water route also allows creates a simple path for
importing oil into China. More than 80 percent of Chinese oil imports
sail across the South China Sea before docking at a Chinese port. The
South China Sea does more than support trade --- it provides a new
source of valuable resources like natural gas and oil. Scientists
estimate that there are between 11 and 22 billion barrels of oil under
the Sea. By growing its military, especially the Navy, the Chinese
government can thwart the five feuding countries that claim control over
parts of the South China Sea. Michael Chase, a researcher at the RAND
Corporation, told the HPR, "Their focus has really been on having the
military capabilities that lets them deter challenges to their influence
by their neighbors or the United States." The recent trend of Chinese
military modernization seems at least partially motivated by a desire to
intimidate smaller countries that might otherwise seek to compete with
China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. "One China" President
[[Xi has]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[vocalized]{.mark} his [intention
of **reuniting Taiwan**]{.mark} with the mainland]{.underline} to create
"One China." [However]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [presents an obstacle to this vision]{.underline}.
Currently, the United States maintains an unofficial embassy in Taiwan
--- the American Institute in Taiwan --- which provides a dose of
political deterrence to China's behavior in the region and legitimizes
claims of Taiwanese independence. Additionally, the United States
allowed the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, to stop in New York on
July 11, 2019 --- a highly unusual move. In the past, to maintain its
respectful diplomatic ties with China, the United States would disallow
the Taiwanese president from touching down on U.S. land. [Though the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has solidified U.S.-Taiwan
diplomatic ties over recent years]{.underline}, [the **growth** of the
PLA may **rupture** that budding relationship]{.underline}. [On June
14]{.underline}, [the PLA conducted [military
exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} on China's Southeast Coast, [near the
Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. [The exercises [were a **response**
to]{.mark} a \$2.2 billion **[arms deal]{.mark}** between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Taiwan]{.underline},
[[indicating]{.mark} China's [willingness to intervene]{.mark} over
Taiwan with military force]{.underline}. [When President Trump did not
cancel the deal at China's request --- and instead started negotiations
to sell **Taiwan [F-16 fighter jets]{.mark}** --- the PLA
[promptly]{.mark} conducted [another set of **military
exercises**]{.mark} near the Taiwan Strait]{.underline} on July 29. [[If
China develops]{.mark} this [**herculean**
military]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[might be forced to
**reconsider**]{.mark} its [support]{.mark} for Taiwanese
independence]{.underline}. [Faced with a bolstered Chinese
military]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[may [become **less likely** to get involved]{.mark} in Taiwan-China
disputes]{.underline} --- [[a stronger]{.mark} Chinese [military
could]{.mark} certainly **[splinter]{.mark}** the current strength of
U.S.-Taiwan [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A stronger PLA
could]{.underline} also [[discourage the]{.mark} Taiwanese [government
from]{.mark} any attempts at [declaring
independence]{.mark}]{.underline}. On January 2, 2019, Xi offered Taiwan
a "one country, two systems" model --- if Taiwan is willing to unite
peacefully. Thus [if China gains a]{.underline} "[first class
military]{.underline}" [like Xi has promised]{.underline}, [[Taiwan
becomes more likely to accept]{.mark} the **[peace]{.mark}ful
deal**]{.underline}, due to the new threat posed by its superior
military. [If the Chinese military presence in the region becomes as
strong and capable as the United States' has been, [U.S. support]{.mark}
for Taiwanese independence [would]{.mark} quickly [become less
reassuring]{.mark}. The [threat of]{.mark} possible [military
intervention]{.mark} by the PLA [may]{.mark} be the factor that
[push]{.mark}es **[reunification]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China's
undisputed control over the South China Sea and reunification with
Taiwan would significantly decrease U.S. influence in the Asian region,
reversing the historically large U.S. presence in Asia.

Byers argues that the [exclusive submarine forums in which]{.underline}
the **[RCN]{.underline}** [participates with its]{.underline} **[closest
allies]{.underline}** [can be preserved in the absence of strict
possession of these systems]{.underline}. Of course, this is just his
opinion, as no evidence is provided that such arrangements would, in
fact, be possible. While he speculates that essentially [it would be in
the **interest of Canada's allies**]{.underline} to [continue to
cooperate due to safety and search and rescue issues]{.underline},
especially in the Arctic, [he fails to understand that waterspace
management is not about search and rescue, but **rather about route
deconfliction**]{.underline}. [Allies participating in submarine
waterspace management do not specifically reveal where each of their
submarines are at any given moment]{.underline}. [Waterspace management
is all about the **safe operation**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[submarines]{.underline}** [among]{.underline} [friendly partners to
**ensure that their submarines do not collide with each
other**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} [are detected as unknown and
potentially hostile targets]{.underline}.19 Remove Canadian submarines
from the game, and there is no longer a 'need to know' basis for sharing
information. In terms of their most highly guarded secrets, nations do
not operate on the basis of charity. This was made dramatically evident
to Canada in 2003 when its decision to abstain from the Iraq invasion
caused the momentary loss of all military information sharing with the
United States.20 New Zealand still feels the reverberations of its
decision to ban US naval vessels from its ports in the 1980s. While the
concept of 'need to share' has been in vogue since the events of 9/11,
it has never been fully embraced, and information sharing, even in
organizations such as NORAD, where Canadian and American operations are
completely integrated and command and control is shared, remains
problematic.21 [Even in terms of waterspace management, **not all
information is shared among allies**]{.underline}, [as the collision
between HMS Vanguard and the French SSBN Le Triomphant
demonstrates]{.underline}.22 Further, Canada's decision to eschew
offensive cyber capabilities for its armed forces has limited cyber
cooperation with 'Four-Eyes' allies. Getting out of the submarine
business would most certainly end any role for Canada in allied
waterspace management. [Byers also dismisses Canadian naval cooperation
with the USN as unnecessary, given that the US could find other NATO
partners to conduct ASW training against conventional diesel powered
submarines]{.underline}. While this is undoubtedly true, it misses the
whole point of why such training is conducted in the first place. [The
US benefits from training against Canada's conventional submarines, but
our navy (and air force) also gain significant benefits from
these]{.underline} [activities]{.underline}. Canada's navy is rightly
regarded as a world class professional force, despite its small size.
Such professionalism makes Canadian ships highly desired in
multinational formations, and has also allowed the RCN to lead those
formations in many instances. International cooperation is a critical
aspect of maintaining this level of world class professionalism.
[Furthermore, given the highly technical nature of submarine operations,
working with American units is a **key way to ensure that our submarine
crews are every bit as good as their colleagues on the
surface**.]{.underline}

[2,800 of these satellites are already in orbit]{.underline}.

outfitted with a wide range of sensing technologies, including synthetic

[The UISS system is a Textron-made **mine countermeasures unmanned

works by sending the unmanned vehicle into a potential mine field ---
with the manned LCS or other host ship at a safe distance --- and using
the USV to "mow the lawn" up and down the area of interest, with the

combination mines in the area.

[The sweep system is among the original requirements for the LCS mine

seen several changes over the past decade of development and
testing.]{.underline}

[The Navy announced Aug. 24 it conducted at-sea testing aboard LCS
Manchester off the coast of California in May and June]{.underline}. The
test event included both "end-to-end minesweeping missions versus Navy

[The **Navy currently operates eight

domain, additionally unchecked subsurface traffic within Canada's
claimed territorial waters pose a direct threat to sovereign claims.
Unfortunately, [both the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited

**comprehensive approach**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[A]{.underline}**nti-**[S]{.underline}**ubmarine

or]{.underline} response [plans for **unwanted subsurface**]{.underline}
Arctic [incursions]{.underline}. The extant threat from widely
proliferated conventional and nuclear submarine technology highlights
North America's vulnerability in the underwater domain. As the number of
[submarines capable of **transiting** below the]{.underline} Arctic [ice
**increases globally**]{.underline}, in the interests of defending North
America the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and

**[w]{.underline}**arfare [that is supported by a **thoroughly

beneath the sea. Additionally, assignment of appropriate anti-submarine
warfare assets and advances in current technology are required to
complete this complex mission in an Arctic environment. This essay has
highlighted through ample data the impending influx of submarine
operations in the Arctic additionally deducing some of the current and
future challenges and vulnerabilities. [From the **structural

There are inherent risks when autonomous systems with any level of
decision-making interact with adversary forces in contested areas. Given
the brittleness of algorithms, the deployment of autonomous systems in a
crisis situation could increase the risk of accidents and
miscalculation. [AI-related CBMs could build on Cold War agreements to
reduce the risk of accidental escalation,]{.underline} with some
modification to account for the new challenges AI-enabled autonomous
systems present. [States have long used established "rules of the road"
to govern the interaction of military]{.underline} forces operating
[with]{.underline} a high degree of [autonomy]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} at [naval vessels]{.underline} at sea, and there may be
similar value in such a CBM for interactions with AI-enabled autonomous
systems. The 1972 [Incidents at Sea Agreement]{.underline} and older
"rules of the road" such as maritime prize law provide useful
[historical examples for how nations have managed analogous challenges
in the]{.underline} past. Building on these historical examples, [states
could adopt a modern-day "international autonomous incidents agreement"
that focuses on military applications of autonomous systems,
especially]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the air and **[maritime
environments]{.underline}**. Such an agreement could help reduce risks
from accidental escalation by autonomous systems, as well as reduce
ambiguity about the extent of human intention behind the behavior of
autonomous systems. In addition to the Incidents at Sea Agreement,
maritime [prize law]{.underline} is [another]{.underline} useful
[historical analogy for how states might craft a rule set for autonomous
systems']{.underline} interactions. Prize law, which first began in the
12th century and evolved more fully among European states in the 15th to
19th centuries, regulated how ships interacted during wartime. Because
both warships and privateers, as a practical matter, operated with a
high degree of autonomy while at sea, prize law [consisted of a set of
rules governing acceptable wartime behavior]{.underline}. Rules covered
which ships could be attacked, ships' markings for identification, the
use of force, seizure of cargo, and providing for the safety of ships'
crews.61 [Nations face an analogous challenge with autonomous systems as
they become increasingly integrated into military forces]{.underline}.
[Autonomous systems will be operating on their own for some period of
time, potentially interacting with assets from other
nations]{.underline}, [including competitors]{.underline}, and there
could be [value in establishing internationally agreed upon "rules of
the road]{.underline}" for how such systems should interact.
[The]{.underline} goal of such an [agreement]{.underline}, which
**[would not have to be as formal]{.underline}** as the Incidents at Sea
Agreement, **[would be to increase predictability and reduce ambiguity
about the behavior of autonomous systems.]{.underline}** Such an
**[agreement could be legally binding but would not necessarily need to
be in order to be useful]{.underline}**. [It would likely need to be
codified]{.underline} in an agreement (or set of agreements), however,
so that expectations are clear by all parties. An ideal set of rules
would be self-enforcing, such that it is against one's own interests to
violate them. Examples of rules of this kind in warfare include
prohibitions against perfidy62 and giving "no quarter,"63 violating
either of which incentivizes the enemy to engage in counterproductive
behavior, such as refusing to recognize surrender or fighting to the
bitter end rather than surrendering. An [**autonomous incidents
agreement could also include provisions for information-sharing about
potential deployments of autonomous systems in disputed areas and
mechanisms for consultation** at the military-to-military level to
resolve questions that arise (**including** potentially **a hotline** to
respond to incidents in real time).]{.underline} One challenge with
[autonomous systems]{.underline} is that their autonomous [programming
is not immediately observable and inspectable from the outside, a major
hurdle for verifying compliance with arms control]{.underline}. One
benefit to an international rule set that governs the behavior of
autonomous systems, particularly in peacetime or pre-conflict settings,
is that [the outward behavior of the system would be observable, even if
its code is not]{.underline}. [Other nations could see how another
country's]{.underline} autonomous air, ground, or maritime drone
[behaves and whether it is complying with the rules]{.underline},
depending on how the rules are written. One benefit to an international
rule set that governs the behavior of autonomous systems, particularly
in peacetime or pre-conflict settings, is that the outward behavior of
the system would be observable, even if its code is not. [Given
the]{.underline} perceived [success of the Incidents at Sea Agreement in
decreasing the risk of accidental and inadvertent escalation between the
United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline}, **[an equivalent
agreement in the AI space might have potential to do the same for a new
generation]{.underline}**. The efficacy of any agreement would depend on
the details, both in the agreement itself and in states' execution. For
example, the United States and China have signed multiple CBM agreements
involving air and maritime deconfliction of military forces, including
the 1998 U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement and the
2014 Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Rules of Behavior for
Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters, yet U.S.-China air and naval
incidents have continued.64 However, the existence of these prior
agreements themselves may be a positive sign about the potential for
U.S.-China cooperation on preventing accidents and could be a building
block for further collaboration. Moreover, in a February 2020 article,
Senior Colonel Zhou Bo in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA)
advocated for CBMs between the United States and China, including on
military AI, drawing on the example of the 1972 Incidents at Sea
Agreement.65 Interest in at least some quarters in the Chinese military
suggests that cooperation may be possible even in the midst of
competition, especially if the PLA is willing to reciprocate American
transparency.66 [In the absence of an internationally agreed upon common
rule set, a country could unilaterally make declaratory statements about
the behavior of its autonomous systems.]{.underline} For example, a
country could say, "If you fire at our autonomous ship/aircraft/vehicle,
it will fire back defensively."67 In principle, [such a rule could
incentivize the desired behavior by other nations]{.underline} (i.e.,
not shooting at the autonomous ship, unless you want to start a
conflict). If every nation adopted this rule, coupled with a
"shoot-second posture" for autonomous systems---they would not fire
unless fired upon first---the result could be a mutually stable
situation. [A unilateral declaration]{.underline} of a set of rules for
avoiding incidents would be analogous to declaring, "I will drive on the
right side of the road. I suggest you do the same or we both will
crash." This [could work if countries' aim is to coordinate their
behavior to avoid conflict]{.underline}, meaning they have some shared
interests in avoiding accidental escalation.

Amid more than two months of intense media focus on the war in Ukraine,
one story was largely overlooked. In late April, the United States and
Russia carried out an exchange of prisoners. [Russia released an
American]{.underline} (a former marine) whom it detained some three
years ago, [while the US released a Russian pilot]{.underline}
imprisoned over a decade ago on drug smuggling charges. What makes [the
exchange]{.underline} noteworthy is that it [took place at a time when
Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has brought relations with the US to
their lowest point since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. The US
has opted to avoid direct military involvement in the war, but it is
doing a great deal to affect its trajectory, including providing Ukraine
with large quantities of increasingly advanced arms, intelligence, and
training so that it can successfully resist and potentially defeat the
Russian forces. The US has also taken steps to strengthen NATO and
impose severe economic sanctions on Russia. The war is likely to stretch
on for some time. Although Ukraine's fundamental interest is to end the
war and prevent more death and destruction, President Volodymyr
Zelensky's desire for peace is conditional. He seeks to regain territory
that Russia occupies and ensure the country's sovereignty is respected
so that, among other things, Ukraine can join the European Union. He
also wants those responsible for war crimes to be held accountable. The

President Vladimir Putin, for his part, needs to achieve an outcome that
justifies his costly invasion lest he appear weak and be challenged at
home. There is little chance that a peace could be negotiated that would
bridge the gap between these two seemingly irreconcilable positions. It
is far more likely that the conflict will continue not just for months,
but for years to come. This will be the backdrop for US and Western
relations with Russia. One possibility for the West would be to link the
entire relationship with Russia to Russia's actions in Ukraine. This
would be a mistake, though, because Russia can affect other Western
interests, such as limiting the nuclear and missile capabilities of Iran
and North Korea, and the success of global efforts to limit the
emissions that cause climate change. The good news is that, as the
prisoner exchange demonstrates**[, profound differences over Ukraine
need not preclude conducting mutually useful business if both sides are
willing to compartmentalize]{.underline}**. But [protecting the
possibility of selective cooperation will require sophisticated,
disciplined diplomacy]{.underline}. For starters, the US and its
partners will need to prioritize and even limit their goals in Ukraine.
This means renouncing talk of regime change in Moscow. We need to deal
with the Russia we have, not the one we would prefer. Putin's position
may come to be challenged from within (or he may succumb to reported
health challenges) but the West is not in a position to engineer his
removal, much less ensure that someone better replaces him. Likewise,
Western governments would be wise to put off talk of war crimes
tribunals for senior Russian officials and stop boasting about helping
Ukraine target senior Russian generals and ships. The war and
investigations are ongoing, and the Russians need to see some benefit in
acting responsibly. The same holds for reparations. Similarly, although
Russia will likely find itself worse off economically and militarily as
a result of initiating this war of choice, the **[US government should
make clear that]{.underline}**, contrary to Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin's remarks, **[America's goal is not to use the war to weaken
Russia]{.underline}**. On the contrary, the US should underscore that it
wants the war to end as soon as possible on terms that reflect Ukraine's
sovereign, independent status. As for the war in Ukraine, the West
should continue to provide support for Ukraine and prevent escalation by
avoiding direct combat. The Kremlin, though, should be made to
understand that this restraint is premised on its not widening the war
to a NATO country or introducing weapons of mass destruction, at which
point such self-imposed Western limits would disappear. The West also
should consider carefully its war aims and how to pursue them. The goal
should be that Ukraine controls all its territory, but this does not
necessarily justify trying to liberate Crimea or even all of the eastern
Donbas region by military force. Some of these goals might be better
sought through diplomacy and selective easing of sanctions. But, until
Russia's behavior changes, sanctions should not just remain in place but
be extended to cover energy imports that are funding the Russian war
effort. **[Diplomacy is a tool of national security to be used, not a
favor to be bestowed, and it should continue to be pursued with
Russia]{.underline}**. [Private meetings between senior civilian and
military officials of Western countries and Russia should resume, in
order to reduce the risk of a miscalculation]{.underline} that could
lead to confrontation or worse, and to explore opportunities for limited
cooperation. It may well be that constructive relations with Russia do
not emerge until well into a post-Putin era. But this in no way alters
the West's interest in seeing that relations do not fall below a certain
floor in the interim.

POST--COLD WAR U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS---WHAT WENT WRONG?

U.S. policy toward Russia since the end of the Cold War is a story of
different administrations pursuing essentially the same set of policies.
[Two aspects stand out as **major irritants**]{.underline} in the
bilateral relationship[: a refusal to accept Russia **as it
is,**]{.underline} as evidenced by repeated initiatives to reform and
remake its political system[; and the **extension of the Euro-Atlantic
security architecture** into the Eurasian space surrounding Russia. Both
of these highly ambitious pursuits have been attempted **repeatedly and
unsuccessfully**, yet both continue to be **cornerstones of official
U.S. policy toward Russia**]{.underline}. In retrospect, it is hard to
escape the conclusion that [a less ambitious U.S. approach to dealing
with Russia]{.underline} and the states of the former Soviet Union
[could have established a **better basis** for a less rocky U.S.-Russian
relationship.]{.underline}

BOOM TO BUST

Addressing a joint session of Congress in January 1991, then president
George H. W. Bush spoke about his desire "to continue to build a lasting
basis" for cooperation with Russia.6 His wish, no doubt sincere, was
expressed at a time of widely held hopes that the Cold War was ending
and the two superpowers would put their differences aside and begin
collaborating on the world's many problems "for a more peaceful future
for all mankind."7

It was indeed a promising phase in relations between Washington and
Moscow, full of significant accomplishments and optimism about the
future. In a short period of time, the two Cold War adversaries
negotiated a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons (START II),
signed a multilateral treaty on conventional forces in Europe,
negotiated the terms for German reunification and a unified Germany's
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and agreed
on a charter for European security and stability after the Cold War.
Moreover, their cooperation was not confined to Europe; they also
jointly sponsored a major conference in Madrid on the Middle East and
successfully dealt with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's aggression against
Kuwait. Most important, they entered into all of these endeavors with a
new spirit of U.S.-Russian partnership, a far cry from the threatening
rhetoric and tensions that had been a hallmark of their relationship for
more than a generation.

For the three decades that followed, the U.S.-Russian relationship went
through a series of boom-bust cycles, reaching its nadir after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and interference in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Through the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and
Barack Obama administrations, U.S. policy toward Russia followed a
familiar pattern. First, a new presidential administration comes into
the White House deeply dissatisfied with the state of the U.S.-Russia
relationship. It commits to do better and launches a policy review that
generates a new approach---a "reset"---toward Russia aimed at developing
a partnership. The road toward partnership looks promising, but
obstacles gradually begin to emerge and eventually escalate into a
full-blown crisis. By the end of the administration's time in office,
the relationship is at the lowest point since the Cold War.

Thus, the spirit of partnership that marked the end of the Cold War did
not last long. The elder Bush's hope for a new relationship with Russia
in a new world order ran into the harsh reality of the rapid
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the chaos that engulfed Russia
less than a year after his speech. The Bush administration had little
chance to prepare for such a dramatic turn of events and develop a
policy commensurate with the magnitude of the change in Russia and
elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. Consumed by domestic economic and
political crises, Russia largely retreated from the world stage and for
the most part was rendered largely incapable of acting as a partner to
the United States as envisioned by Bush. Demoralized and embittered
Russian elites soon constructed a narrative---greatly amplified by the
Kremlin throughout Vladimir Putin's presidency---that the United States
had taken advantage of their country at a moment of weakness, which
created a sense of victimhood and soured the overall atmosphere in
U.S.-Russian relations.

The Clinton administration, frustrated with what it saw as its
predecessor's insufficiently robust engagement to support reforms in
Russia, declared its intent in 1993 to build "the foundation for a new
democratic partnership between the United States and Russia."8 Speaking
in Vancouver, Canada, in April 1993, at the first of his many summits
with Russia's then president Boris Yeltsin, Clinton promised:

> Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it
> comes to democracy and Russia. We know where we stand. We are with
> Russian democracy, we are with Russian reforms, we are with Russian
> markets. We support freedom of conscience and speech and religion. We
> support respect for ethnic minorities. We actively support reform and
> reformers and you in Russia.9

Soon after these hopeful words were spoken, [the relationship
encountered its first bumps]{.underline}. In late September and early
October 1993, tensions between the Russian executive and legislative
branches came to a head in a bloody confrontation in Moscow, as the
constitutional crisis between Yeltsin and his rebellious parliament led
to violence in the streets. When the dust settled, Yeltsin had managed
to push through a new constitution that consolidated executive power to
such an extent that in effect it placed the presidency above all other
branches of government. That same [autumn, Russian officials expressed
their strong **opposition to NATO enlargement**]{.underline}1[, which
was emerging as the **principal pillar of U.S. policy** in
Europe.]{.underline}0

In recent weeks, a fair amount of speculative ink has been spilled about
the prospect of Vladimir Putin using nuclear weapons to achieve his war
aims in Ukraine. Thankfully, despite Putin's overt nuclear signaling,
the conflict remains well below the nuclear threshold. However, [this
doesn't mean that Putin's war in [Ukraine]{.mark} won't have potentially
profound long-term [consequences for]{.mark} [Russia's nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}----[specifically**, its [ability to
complete its modernization]{.mark}** program on time in the face of
overwhelming sanctions. Russia is in the midst of a decades-long nuclear
modernization]{.underline} campaign to replace all of its Soviet-era
weapons with new systems by the mid-2020s. [This modernization is the
top priority]{.underline} for both Russia's military and for Putin. In
his annual end-of-year speech in 2020, Putin underscored the importance
of keeping pace with Russia's nuclear competitors: "It is absolutely
unacceptable to stand idle. The pace of change in all areas that are
critical for the Armed Forces is unusually fast today. It is not even
Formula 1 fast -- it is supersonic fast. You stop for one second, and
you start falling behind immediately." [Despite Putin's stated emphasis
on speedy nuclear [modernization]{.mark}, several big-ticket systems
[have been **plagued by** ]{.mark}**multi-year [delays]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}----in some cases----**[abrupt
[cancellations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These [[chronic delays have
affected]{.mark} some of the most highly anticipated delivery systems in
Russia's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. [Russia's]{.underline} new Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile ([[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}) [was
supposed to be operational by 2018]{.underline} but [wasn't even flight
tested until April 2022]{.underline}. Additionally, in 2018, Russia also
postponed the Rubezh ICBM----originally intended to be one of the
primary carriers for Russia's Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle----and
canceled the development of a rail-based ICBM known as Barguzin. The
development of both Russia's new Borei ballistic missile submarines and
their Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) were delayed
by several years, along with the development of the next-generation
PAK-DA strategic bomber. All this is to say, Russia's nuclear
modernization hasn't exactly been "Formula 1 fast."

[implicat]{.mark}ions for **[global security]{.mark}**. Concealed
submarines bearing ballistic missiles provide the threat of retaliation
against a first nuclear strike. What if that changes]{.underline}? "[We
take for granted]{.underline} the degree to which we rely upon [having a
significant portion of our forces exist in an]{.underline} essentially
[invulnerable position]{.underline}," Lewis says. [[Even if new]{.mark}
[developments did not reduce submarine stealth by much, **the mere
perception**]{.mark} of such a reduction [could **undermine strategic
stability**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A gray unmanned helicopter,
notably lacking a cockpit or any kind of window, is shown hovering
against a clear, blue sky. It carries a downward-poinging sensor under
its nose. A Northrop Grumman MQ-8C, an uncrewed helicopter, has recently
been deployed by the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific area for use in
surveillance. In the future, it will also be used for antisubmarine
operations. NORTHROP GRUMMAN Gottemoeller warns that "[[**any
perception** that nuclear-armed submarines have become]{.mark} [more
targetable will lead to]{.mark} questions about the survivability of
second-strike forces]{.underline}. Consequently, [[countries]{.mark} are
going to [do everything they can to counter]{.mark} any such
[vulnerability.]{.mark}"]{.underline} Experts disagree on the
irreversibility of ocean transparency. Because any technological
breakthroughs will not be implemented overnight, "nations should have
ample time to develop countermeasures \[that\] cancel out any improved
detection capabilities," says Matt Korda, senior research associate at
the Federation of American Scientists, in Washington, D.C. However,
Roger Bradbury and eight colleagues at the National Security College of
the Australian National University disagree, claiming that [any
technical ability to counter detection technologies will start to
decline by 2050.]{.underline} Korda also points out that ocean
transparency, to the extent that it occurs, "[will not affect countries
equally]{.underline}. And that raises some interesting questions." For
example, [U.S. nuclear-powered submarines are "the quietest on the
planet. They are virtually undetectable. Even if submarines become more
visible in general, this may have zero meaningful effect on U.S.
submarines' survivability."]{.underline} Sylvia Mishra, a new-tech
nuclear officer at the European Leadership Network, a London-based think
tank, says she is "more concerned about the overall problem of ambiguity
under the sea." Until recently, she says, movement under the oceans was
the purview of governments. Now, though, there's a growing industry
presence under the sea. For example, companies are laying many
underwater fiber-optic communication cables, Mishra says, "which may
lead to greater congestion of underwater inspection vehicles, and the
possibility for confusion." A large, cylindrical vehicle is shown just
as it has been lowered below the surface of the water, suspended by two
green cables. A Snakehead, a large underwater drone designed to be
launched and recovered by U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines, is shown
at its christening ceremony in Narragansett Bay in Newport, R.I.U.S.
NAVY Confusion might come from the fact that drones, unlike surface
ships, do not bear a country flag, and therefore their ownership may be
unclear. This uncertainty, coupled with the possibility that the drones
could also carry lethal payloads, increases the risk that a naval force
might view an innocuous commercial drone as hostile. "Any actions that
hold the strategic assets of adversaries at risk may produce new touch
points for conflict and exacerbate the risk of war," says Mishra. Given
the strategic importance of submarine stealth, Gower asks, "Why would
any country want to [[detect and track]{.mark}
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}? **[[It's only something you'd do if
you want to make a nuclear-armed power nervous]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Even [in the Cold War, when the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the U.K. routinely [tracked Soviet]{.underline}
ballistic-missile [submarines**, they did so only because they knew
their activities would go undetected**]{.underline}---that is,
**[without risking escalation]{.underline}**. Gower postulates that this
was dangerously arrogant: "[**[To actively track second-strike nuclear
forces is about as escalatory as you might
imagine]{.mark}**."]{.underline} "[All nuclear-armed states place a
great value on their second-strike forces]{.underline}," Gottemoeller
says. [If [greater]{.mark} ocean [transparency produces new
risks]{.mark} to their survivability]{.underline}, **[[real or
perceived]{.underline}]{.mark}**, she says, [[countries]{.mark}
[may]{.mark} respond in two ways: [build up their nuclear forces
further]{.mark} and take new measures to protect and defend them,
**[producing a new arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}; or else keep the
number of nuclear weapons limited and find other ways to bolster their
viability.

Although the risk of [[**nuclear war** between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} may not appear to be as much of a threat as
it was during the Cold War, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} still a
**[[looming]{.underline}]{.mark}** possibility. As a matter of doctrine,
[Russia]{.underline} has [articulated]{.underline} its [**willingness**
to **use nuclear weapons** in response to anything it deems]{.underline}
to be [an existential threat]{.underline}, stating,

> The Russian Federation shall reserve for itself the right to employ
> nuclear weapons in response to the use against it and/or its allies of
> nuclear and other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, as well as in
> the case of aggression against the Russian Federation with use of
> conventional weapons when the state's very existence has been
> threatened.86

Against the backdrop of Russia's violations of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty and the U.S. announcement that it would walk away
from that treaty, as well as the earlier U.S. 2002 withdrawal from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, [Russia's [**strategic enhancements**
to]{.mark} its [nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}---including changes
to its intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles---[appear **[particularly
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.87

In this context, [any changes or perceived changes in]{.underline} U.S.
and NATO **[nuclear forces]{.underline}**---such as the recent placement
of missile defense systems in Eastern Europe and discussion of
increasing nuclear force posture---[serve to **further jeopardize
strategic stability** with Russia]{.underline}.88 [Putin]{.underline}
has [expressed]{.underline} a great deal of [concern about]{.underline}
U.S. [nuclear force developments, which he sees as being targeted at
Russia]{.underline} despite U.S. assertions that the focus of its
nuclear deterrence is on threats from Iran and North Korea.89 Thus far,
[nuclear deterrence has largely rested on the [strategic stability
enabled by]{.mark} the **[relative parity]{.mark}** between U.S. and
Russian nuclear forces. Any [shifts]{.mark} in this balance, coupled
with the Russian belief that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [intends to launch a nuclear attack, may [spark
Russian fears]{.mark} that [it will **lose**]{.mark} its
**[second-strike]{.mark}** capability, [increasing]{.mark} its
[incentive to **strike first**]{.mark}]{.underline}.90 In a classic
security dilemma scenario, [U.S. and NATO [attempts to
**strengthen**]{.mark} their **[defensive
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly in the nuclear realm,
[may **[inadvertently appear]{.mark}** to be
**[offensive]{.mark}**---and therefore threatening---behavior and
[trigger]{.mark} the outbreak of [**conventional** or]{.mark} even
**[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.91 [Given Russia's]{.underline}
expressed [willingness to use nuclear weapons and Putin's tendency to
interpret any]{.underline} U.S. [nuclear force developments as
offensive, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should]{.underline} be careful to [avoid **inadvertently provoking a
nuclear response** from Russia while attempting to deter this exact
behavior. Risks of **Russian nuclear escalation** might also be prompted
by major changes in the balance of **conventional forces**]{.underline}.
From this perspective, [the ultimate risk associated with enhancing
**any form** of U.S. or NATO **military capabilities** is that Russia
may feel that it has to respond with a **nuclear attack** if it is
unable to **match** U.S. and NATO combined conventional military
strength]{.underline}. Therefore, [enhancing and expanding
[capabilities, **even if**]{.mark} they are **[defensive]{.mark}** in
nature, [may create such a **strong perception of threat**]{.mark} for
Russia [that it could prompt a **preemptive nuclear
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.92

**Nuclear modernization is slow, took over 20 years for Sarmat**

**Harddie et al 4/28** (Anthony Ruggiero, Bradley Bowman and John
Hardie, "Russia's Sarmat test underscores need to modernize US nuclear
triad" Defense News, 4/28/2022,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/04/28/russias-sarmat-test-underscores-need-to-modernize-us-nuclear-triad/)//mcu>

Russia conducted its first flight test of the RS-28 Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile on April 20. [The launch represents a
notable milestone in Russia's ongoing nuclear modernization]{.underline}
designed to hold the American homeland at risk, underscoring the
importance of modernizing the U.S. nuclear triad and associated nuclear
command, control and communications system. Russia's Defence Ministry
announced the Sarmat "was successfully test-launched from a silo at the
Plesetsk state testing cosmodrome" in northwestern [Russia. The test
"confirmed" the missile's "design characteristics"]{.underline} during
"all phases of its flight," the ministry declared, adding that its
"practice warheads arrived at the designated area at the Kura proving
ground on the Kamchatka Peninsula." Although [Russia has conducted three
Sarmat ejection tests since December 2017,]{.underline} this latest test
was the missile's first flight test. The Sarmat is a three-stage,
silo-based, liquid-fuel, heavy ICBM with a reported range of 18,000
kilometers. Dubbed "Satan II" by NATO, the missile is a Russian-built
replacement of the Soviet-era SS-18 "Satan" ICBM, which is reaching the
end of its life cycle. The Sarmat reportedly can carry a 10-ton payload
consisting of 10-plus multiple independent reentry vehicles along with
penetration aids used to evade missile defenses. Moscow says the new
missile can also carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles. The
**[Sarmat has reportedly been under development since the
2000s]{.underline}** but gained notoriety after being publicly touted
during a March 2018 address by Russian President Vladimir Putin. [The
Russian leader boasted that the Sarmat would be impervious to existing
or potential missile defenses thanks to its short boost phase and
extremely long rang]{.underline}e, which would allow the missile to
travel over the North or South poles. Missiles are often their most
vulnerable during the boost phase, and most American missile sensors
normally focus on threats traveling over the North Pole rather than the
South Pole. Regardless, [existing U.S. missile defense capabilities are
focused on rogue states such as North Korea and stand no chance of
defending against a massive Russian nuclear attack against the American
homeland, reinforcing the need for a robust and reliable U.S. nuclear
deterrent.]{.underline} Moscow claims serial production of the Sarmat
will commence this fall, and that the missile will begin combat duty
with Russia's 62nd Missile Division in Uzhur, Krasnoyarsk Krai, before
year's end, although that timeline is likely unrealistic. The test
itself was "routine" and "not a surprise," as Pentagon press secretary
John Kirby noted. Indeed, Sarmat's **[flight tests have been delayed for
years, making this test long overdue.]{.underline}** That, however, did
not stop Putin from calling the test a "momentous event," vowing the
missile "will be a wakeup call for those who are trying to threaten"
Russia. That [provocative language follows several instances of nuclear
saber-rattling by Putin]{.underline} both before and after Russia
launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Putin's behavior stands in
stark contrast with the Biden administration's decision to postpone and
then cancel a March 3 launch of an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM. The
administration had already notified Russia and provided a notification
for civilian air traffic. Kirby attempted to justify the postponement as
an effort to ensure U.S. actions were not "misunderstood or
misconstrued," saying the decision demonstrated Washington is "a
responsible nuclear power." Putin, however, may interpret such
concessions by Washington as weakness and an indication that his nuclear
saber-rattling is working. Asked about the Minuteman III test during a
March hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. Charles
Richard, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, recommended "that we
maintain our normal set of operations." Richard emphasized he needs
these tests to "maintain confidence and reliability" in the 50-year-old
Minuteman III, which faces growing reliability concerns as it nears the
end of its service life. Another test is slated for later this year,
which the administration should conduct as planned. That will remind
Putin that the United States has the means to respond to a nuclear
attack. More broadly, the Sarmat test --- not to mention China's rapid
nuclear expansion --- underscores the need to modernize America's own
nuclear triad, including by urgently replacing the Minuteman III with
the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, otherwise known as the LGM-35A
Sentinel.

**Russian military modernization has been halted by the war in Ukraine
-- sanctions prevent development of advanced weapons because they rely
on foreign microelectronics.**

[U.S. and international [economic sanctions and export
controls]{.mark}]{.underline} are [likely to [significantly **hamper**
Russia's ability to produce **advanced**]{.mark} **fighter
[jets]{.mark}**[, **naval platforms**, and **space
capabilities**]{.mark} essential to the Kremlin's efforts to modernize
its military]{.underline}, the U.S. Defense Department's No. 2 official
said. The Pentagon and Western governments have indicated for weeks that
[Russia]{.underline} is [struggling to restock precision-guided
munitions that use foreign-made computer chips and guidance systems to
help them hit targets]{.underline}, [which has an immediate impact on
Russia's war in Ukraine]{.underline}. But U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary
Kathleen Hicks, who is in Europe on her first international trip after a
year on the job, told reporters on Tuesday that [the [Kremlin's]{.mark}
deep [reliance on foreign-produced microelectronics]{.mark} that are now
[under harsh economic controls]{.mark} is [expected to hamper]{.mark} a
much [wide]{.mark}r [range of]{.mark} [platforms]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"The [economic costs of Putin's decision to undertake this war are going
to be significant for Russia, and Russia's defense industry will feel
that]{.underline}," Hicks told reporters during a press conference at
U.S. European Command headquarters, where she traveled to visit U.S. and
European troops helping to oversee the transit of military aid to
Ukraine. "I do anticipate you'll see that across the breadth of their
major modernization areas." "Whether it's advanced fighter aircraft,
whether it's in their advanced munitions, whether it's in their naval
platforms, **[microelectronics are central]{.underline}**," Hicks added.
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[military modernization
plan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [set to conclude in 2027,]{.underline} is
[[focused on backing up]{.mark} the [Kremlin's ground forces]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} a bevy of long-range weapons systems that could hold NATO
nations at bay, including two varieties of **[hypersonic]{.mark}
missile[s]{.mark}**, sea- and air-launched Kalibr [**cruise missiles**,
and]{.mark} short- and intermediate-range **[Iskander
missiles]{.mark}**---all of which have been used in combat in
Ukraine.]{.underline} A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on
condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the Pentagon, said
[[Russia has aimed to perfect **"non-contact"** war]{.mark}fare
[against]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} alliance, using standoff strikes if
it were to come to blows with European nations in a wider regional
war---areas of military modernization where Russia could now face
significant headwinds.]{.underline} But even before Russian President
Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February,
eight years of fighting in the country's Donbas region had helped sever
vital links with Ukrainian aerospace industries and shipbuilders,
delaying the rollout of new ships and submarines and forcing the Kremlin
to turn to Soviet-era designs for some aircraft. Dating back to the 2002
U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, [Putin has
sought to concentrate the Kremlin's focus on developing the nuclear
triad and emerging technologies, highlighted by six novel nuclear
weapons systems unveiled in 2018 that are not covered by arms control
treaties.]{.underline} And [[Russia has]{.mark} long [struggled to get
its fifth-generation Sukhoi]{.mark} Su-57 [fighter jet]{.mark} [program
running]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with]{.mark} just [**four** aircraft
entering service since the program was inaugurated]{.mark} in
2020]{.underline}. The modern fighter was missing in action during
Russia's "Victory Day" parade in Moscow at the beginning of the month,
and [three months into the war, Russian forces still have not achieved
air superiority.]{.underline} The [[microelectronics that Russia is
struggling to get ahold of "form the **backbone** of modern military
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jesse Salazar, who was the
Pentagon's top official for industrial policy until earlier this year.
He said the [coronavirus [pandemic]{.mark} has also
**[stressed]{.mark}** the [defense industry]{.mark}, [forcing]{.mark}
some [product lead times from six months to two years]{.mark} with
digitization moving forward rapidly.]{.underline} "[The [sanctions on
Russia]{.mark} will likely [exacerbate]{.mark} this [supply chain
challenge and make production of advanced technology systems much harder
and longer]{.mark}, especially in defense,"]{.underline} he said. The
senior U.S. defense official said Russia's game plan for a wider
regional war, known as "active defense," envisions using preemptive
strikes to bloody the nose of NATO forces and deter them from attack.
U.S. officials are still trying to understand how Russian military
aspirations to field high-grade weapons compare with their actual
capabilities on the battlefield, where Russian forces have struggled to
ensure basic logistics and have incurred disastrous troop losses in just
a few months of fighting. The [economic impact of Russia's war in
Ukraine is also taxing the Kremlin's weapons sales abroad]{.underline},
officials said. [Russia is responsible for about a fifth of [global arms
sales](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46937) around the
world since 2016, including to India, which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has been trying to dissuade from buying Russian
weapons]{.underline}. "What [we're seeing]{.underline} is a [significant
challenge for them on arms sales because of all the economic effects
that they're experiencing from their decision to pursue this war in
Ukraine,"]{.underline} said Hicks, the Pentagon's No. 2 official. She
called [arms sales one of Russia's "major levers" of influence in
Africa.]{.underline} Russia has increasingly sought to try to insulate
itself from international supply chains, boosting state spending to fund
the electronics industry by 800 percent in 2021 alone. "This was likely
to have been used to finance the development of electronics to replace
those banned by Western sanctions imposed in 2014," wrote Richard
Connolly, an expert on the Russian economy who leads the Eastern
Advisory Group consultancy, in a recent report commissioned by the
Pentagon. Connolly said Chinese firms could also help Russia with the
production of components and with designs for advanced missiles.
[Russian pilots]{.underline} have already [struggled to navigate the
skies over the battlefield]{.underline}, and their [obstacles go beyond
just Ukraine's air defenses]{.underline}. In a speech this month,
British defense secretary [Ben
Wallace](https://nixolympia.com/ben-wallace-russian-pilots-are-taping-basic-gps-devices-to-their-dashboards-in-ukraine/)
said [crashed Russian SU-34 jets in Ukraine had been found with GPS
receivers taped to their instrument panels "so that the pilots knew
where they were because of the poor quality of their own
systems]{.underline}." Experts expect that [semiconductor and computer
chip sanctions will force the Kremlin to put more **Soviet-era**
equipment onto the battlefield]{.underline}. (Russia is reportedly
preparing to deploy old T-62 tanks, first deployed in the early 1960s,
to the fight in Ukraine due to ongoing losses of more advanced
equipment.) "They'll not lack for basic platforms in storage that they
can bring into use to replace losses, but [advanced navigation,
sighting, stabilization, and weapon seeker components won't be available
due to sanctions, so the quality will be lower]{.underline}," said
Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services
Institute in London focused on air power and technology. "They'll
struggle to produce modern cockpit displays, navigation equipment,
radars, and weapon seekers for their combat aircraft."

The [U.S.-Russia relationship is defined by Russian fear of its own
weaknesses]{.underline} (economic, technological, etc.) and paranoia
about U.S. and NATO threats to its security. [Russia currently fears
U.S. conventional superiority]{.underline}20 and has invested in
capabilities and tactics to circumvent it.21 It is [embarking on a
modernization program for its nuclear weapons]{.underline} in part
[because it **feels insecure about the survivability of its nuclear
forces**]{.underline} as the United States increases its progress on
ballistic missile defense. [If the **U**nited **S**tates were able to
**track Russian** nuclear-armed **submarines** with increased
confidence, it could **exacerbate these Russian fears** even more,
causing Russia to **respond in destabilizing ways**]{.underline}. While
it is true that Russia has never relied as much on submarine-based
weapons as the United States has, [the degradation of the survivability
of Russia's nuclear-armed submarines would likely cause Russia to
compensate for this new vulnerability.]{.underline} This is especially
true if continued advancements in precision strike make Russia's air-
and land-based nuclear forces more vulnerable. If [Russia can no longer
rely on hardening and concealment for survivability]{.underline}, they
[may double down on redundancy, producing and **deploying larger
numbers** of **nuclear** **weapons**]{.underline} to [complicate U.S.
targeting and increase the odds that a retaliatory capability survives
any U.S. first strike]{.underline}. This, in turn, could put the [final
**nail in the coffin of arms control** and lead to an **arms race** with
the United States that drains resources]{.underline}, [intensifies
**mistrust**, and makes **miscalculation** more **likely**.]{.underline}
In short, [a significant U.S. advantage in submarine
detection]{.underline} (which would [likely]{.underline} [develop in
parallel with a U.S. advantage in remote sensing and precision strike
capabilities in other domains]{.underline}) would [likely be
**destabilizing** due to **Russian sensitivity** **over** its
**technological inferiority**]{.underline}. This could compel Russia not
only to [increase redundancy with a larger number of
warheads]{.underline}, but to [change the doctrine governing their use
as well]{.underline}. It is possible that in an environment of degraded
second-strike stability, Russia [could move further towards a first-use
doctrine]{.underline} to deter escalation and [to avoid the "lose them
or lose them" dilemma]{.underline}. China would likely be less sensitive
to advancements in U.S. submarine detection capabilities for two
reasons. First, China's strategic relationship with the United States,
at least currently, is not defined by an assumed need for parity but by
a need for a minimum reprisal capability, which it believes it has and
will continue to have in the future.22 It currently has a much smaller
nuclear arsenal than the United States and relies on hardened and
road-mobile land-based ICBMs for its retaliatory capability, which it
believes is sufficient as long as it can hit the United States with just
a few nuclear warheads, or even a single nuclear warhead.23 Second,
China has not historically relied on SSBNs for its second-strike
capability, and even as it begins deploying a credible sea-based nuclear
deterrent for the first time,24 it recognizes that its submarines are
less advanced and thus more vulnerable to ASW than U.S. submarines.
Therefore, China will likely continue to rely on land-based nuclear
forces.25 The remote sensing and precision strike revolution will
certainly have implications for U.S.-China relations, but in the narrow
hypothetical of U.S. superiority in submarine detection,
**[China]{.underline}** would be less concerned than Russia. They [may,
however, be sufficiently concerned that they decide to **expand** the
size of **their** **arsenal** as a hedge]{.underline}. Overall,
[conditions under which the United States had a significant advantage in
submarine detection]{.underline} could [push some adversaries away from
an assured retaliation nuclear posture]{.underline} and
[towards]{.underline} what Vipin Narang calls an **[asymmetric
escalation nuclear posture.]{.underline}**26 An [asymmetric escalation
nuclear posture entails **threatening to use nuclear weapons first** in
a]{.underline} [conflict to deter conflict]{.underline} and to prevent
successful counterforce targeting by an adversary. If nations currently
predisposed towards adopting assured retaliation postures no longer feel
that the second-strike forces necessary for such a posture are secure,
they [may be forced to adopt asymmetric escalation
postures]{.underline}.

STEALTH?," IEEE Spectrum, 16 JUL 2022,
<https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-submarine)//mcu>

[SUBMARINES ARE VALUED]{.underline} primarily [for their ability to
hide.]{.underline} The [assurance that submarines]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} likely [survive the first missile
strike]{.underline} in a nuclear war [and]{.underline} thus [be able to
respond by]{.underline} launching missiles in a [second strike is key to
the strategy of deterrence known as mutually assured destruction. **Any
new technology that might render the oceans effectively transparent,
making it trivial to spot lurking submarines, could thus undermine the
peace of the world**]{.underline}. For nearly a century, naval engineers
have striven to develop ever-faster, ever-quieter submarines. But they
have worked just as hard at advancing a wide array of radar, sonar, and
other technologies designed to detect, target, and eliminate enemy
submarines. The balance seemed to turn with the emergence of
nuclear-powered submarines in the early 1960s. In a 2015 study for the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, Bryan Clark, a naval
specialist now at the Hudson Institute, noted that the [ability of these
boats to remain submerged for long periods of time made them "nearly
impossible to find with radar and active sonar.]{.underline}" But even
these [stealthy submarines produce subtle, very-low-frequency noises
that can be picked up from far away by networks of acoustic hydrophone
arrays mounted to the seafloor]{.underline}. And now [the game of
submarine hide-and-seek may be approaching the point at which submarines
can no longer elude detection and simply disappear]{.underline}. It may
come as early as 2050, according to a recent study by the National
Security College of the Australian National University, in Canberra.
This timing is particularly significant because the enormous costs
required to design and build a submarine are meant to be spread out over
at least 60 years. A submarine that goes into service today should still
be in service in 2082. Nuclear-powered submarines, such as the
Virginia-class fast-attack submarine, each cost roughly US \$2.8
billion, according to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. And that's
just the purchase price; the total life cycle cost for the new
Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine is estimated to exceed \$395
billion. The twin problems of detecting submarines of rival countries
and protecting one's own submarines from detection are enormous, and the
technical details are closely guarded secrets. [Many naval experts are
speculating about sensing technologies that could be used in concert
with **modern AI**]{.underline} methodologies [to neutralize a
submarine's stealth]{.underline}. Rose Gottemoeller, former deputy
secretary general of [NATO, warns that "the stealth of submarines will
be difficult to sustain, as sensing of all kinds, in multiple spectra,
in and out of the water becomes more ubiquitous]{.underline}." And [the
ongoing contest between stealth and detection is becoming increasingly
volatile]{.underline} [as]{.underline} these [new technologies threaten
to overturn the balance.]{.underline}

This is not to say that the NPT is a complete failure. The world had
tens of thousands of nuclear weapons during the cold war era, and that
number has been significantly brought down. NPT [was also successful in
keeping a check on the states that successfully developed nuclear
capabilitie]{.underline}s. **[However]{.underline}**, despite an
undertaking in 2000 to eliminate nuclear arsenals from the planet,
existing **[nuclear powers continue upgrading their existing
arsenals]{.underline}** at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars.

Events like the Russia-Ukraine war and the [resultant perceived
helplessness and erosion of trust in global organisations
like]{.underline} the UN and international accords like the Budapest
Memorandum could potentially cause a **[renewed surge of interest in the
development of nuclear capabilities]{.underline}** [as the ultimate
deterrent against invasion]{.underline} and guarantor of sovereignty.
However, [building and implementing a comprehensive control]{.underline}
and [command program is **significantly more difficult**]{.underline}
[than building the actual weapon,]{.underline} and [spurred nuclear
proliferation especially in developing **countries could exponentially
increase the risk of a catastrophic, nuclear event**]{.underline},
accidental or deliberate.

**That causes [global nuclear war]{.underline}.**

The move comes as the administration is proposing to increase spending
to more than \$44 billion next year to continue and, in some cases,
accelerate programs to replace and upgrade all the major elements of the
bloated U.S. arsenal. Unless curtailed, the plan, which departs in
important ways from long-standing U.S. policies, will accelerate [global
nuclear [competition]{.mark}]{.underline} and [increase]{.underline} the
[[risk]{.mark} of **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As if to underscore the dangers of the administration's strategy, the
Defense Department led an exercise last month simulating a limited
nuclear war. "The scenario included a [European
contingency]{.underline}.... [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} decides to
[[use a]{.mark} **low-yield**, [**limited nuclear weapon**
against]{.mark}]{.underline} a site on **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
territory," and [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[fires back with a "**limited" nuclear
response**]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the Pentagon. The U.S.
response presumably involved the low-yield sub-launched warhead, known
as the W76-2.

The exercise perpetuates the dangerous illusion that a nuclear war can
be fought and won. The new warhead, which packs a five-kiloton explosive
yield, is large enough destroy a large city. It would be delivered on
the same type of long-range ballistic missile launched from the same
strategic submarine that carries missiles loaded with 100-kiloton
strategic warheads. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n military leaders
would be [[**hard pressed** to know, in the **heat
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**crisis**, whether the missile was part
of a "**limited" strike** or]{.mark} the first wave of [an
**all-out**]{.mark} nuclear **[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, Trump officials insist that the president needs "more
credible" nuclear use options to deter the possible first use of nuclear
weapons by Russia. In reality, [[once nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} of any kind [[are detonated]{.mark} in a
conflict between nuclear]{.underline}-armed [adversaries, [there is **no
guarantee** against a **cycle of escalation** leading to]{.mark} all-out
**[global nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Lowering the
[threshold]{.underline} for nuclear use by making nuclear weapons "more
usable" takes the United States and Russia and the world in the wrong
direction.

**[The United States, waging a "maximum pressure" sanctions campaign

has been trying to build an international consensus that Iran was behind
last week's blasts, as well as a May 12 strike on four oil tankers off
the United Arab Emirates.

[**Tehran has denied any involvement** in both attacks near the Strait

which was hit by explosions along with the Norwegian-owned Front Altair
ship on June 13.

"[The limpet mine that was used in the attack is distinguishable and

already been publicly displayed**]{.underline} in Iranian military
parades," said Commander Sean Kido, commanding officer of an explosive
ordinance dive and salvage task group in the Naval Forces Central
Command (NAVCENT).

He was speaking to reporters at a NAVCENT facility near the UAE port of
Fujairah. Small fragments said to have been removed from the Kokuka
Courageous were on display alongside a magnet purportedly left by the
IRCG team allegedly captured on video.

ISTANBUL --- [**Turkey and Romania have scrambled in recent days to
neutralize potentially explosive mines** amid concerns]{.underline} that
the weapons may be [drifting across the Black Sea from Ukraine's
shores]{.underline} toward neighboring countries.

Defense ministries for both countries, in separate announcements Monday,
said they had dispatched their naval forces to defuse mines of unknown
origin that appeared near their coasts.

[**A mine that appeared Monday was the second reported in the waters
near Turkey** in three days. Turkey's government had said previously
that it was in contact with both Moscow and Kyiv]{.underline} about the
weapons, but did not specify which side, if either, was responsible for
the mines.

Bulgaria's government last week warned people living in three districts
near its Black Sea coast to beware of possible drifting mines, according
to [local media
reports](https://www.novinite.com/articles/214374/Bulgarian+Fishermen+should+not+Enter+the+Sea+because+of+Dangerous+Mines+in+the+Water).

[**The scramble comes after Russia's intelligence service**, the
FSB, [claimed](http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm%21id%3D10439461%40fsbMessage.html) on
March 19 that poor weather **had caused more than 400 naval mines to
become disconnected** from the cables that were anchoring
them]{.underline}, and warned that the mines were "drifting freely in
the western part of the Black Sea," which includes the territorial
waters of Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey.

Ukraine at the time dismissed the assertion as untrue and politically
motivated. "This is complete disinformation from the Russian side,"
Viktor Vyshnov, deputy head of Ukraine's Maritime Administration, [told
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/mines-ukraine-drift-into-black-sea-russia-shipping-sources-say-2022-03-21/).
"This was done to justify the closure of these districts of the Black
Sea under so-called 'danger of mines.' " The Washington Post was not
able to independently verify either side's claim.

A 1907 [international
treaty](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague08.asp) prohibits
countries from laying [unanchored
mines](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/215-250002?OpenDocument) designed
to damage ships unless they can be controlled or are "constructed as to
become harmless one hour at most after the person who laid them ceases
to control them."

[**The [Romanian Defense
Ministry](https://www.mapn.ro/cpresa/17361_mina-marina,-observata-in-largul-marii-negre,-la-70-de-kilometri-travers-de-capu-midia) said
Monday that a fishing vessel had spotted a drifting mine** about 8 a.m.
and alerted maritime authorities,]{.underline} which then undertook an
operation to neutralize it about 39 nautical miles from the Port of
Midia, in southeast Romania. The ministry did not say where the mine
came from and an update on the operation was not immediately available.

[Meanwhile,
**Turkey [said](https://twitter.com/tcsavunma/status/1508341676640776193?s=20&t=y7Ix2flzoa7FytGg4IjrEQ) Monday
that it had [neutralized a
mine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/26/russia-ukraine-war-news-putin-live-updates/#link-IX52NM2WY5BHTLZ62OUEUDA5F4?itid=lk_inline_manual_16) detected
off the coast of Igneada**, a town in the country's northwest near the
border with Bulgaria]{.underline}, while on Saturday another mine, which
was thought to have drifted from the Black Sea, forced a temporary
closure of the Bosporus, the key waterway that runs through Istanbul.

**[The incident raised fears that the conflict between Russia and
Ukraine could threaten traffic in the Bosporus]{.underline}**, [a choke
point for global energy supplies and
commerce](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/09/bosporus-strait-canal-istanbul-erdogan/?itid=lk_inline_manual_93&itid=lk_inline_manual_17).

Photographs purporting to show the mine depicted what appeared to be a
metallic orb with spikes. On Saturday, Turkey's defense minister, Hulusi
Akar, described the mine as "old" and said Turkey had been in touch with
the Kremlin and with Kyiv about its appearance in the Bosporus.

Ukraine says," Politico,
https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-holds-key-to-unblocking-black-sea-grain-deal-ukraine-says/

[**Ukraine is looking to Turkey for security guarantees that would
unlock a deal with Russia to allow millions of tons of grain to be
shipped** through the Black Sea to a hungry world.]{.underline}

A government official in **[Kyiv told POLITICO a plan is under
discussion that would open up blocked Ukrainian ports for ships loaded
with grain]{.underline}**. [A security guarantee provided by Turkey or
another state --- likely one within NATO --- is now the crucial missing
piece of a deal, and if all sides can agree, a plan could be finalized
within days, the official said.]{.underline}

[The official cautioned that it is \"premature to be too optimistic\"
about the prospects of an agreement]{.underline}, given how sensitive
and difficult the talks are. But the outline of a potential deal, as
seen by Kyiv, comes amid positive noises from the leaders of Turkey and
Italy in recent days.

[The stakes are high as the world faces a struggle to cope without wheat
and other agri-food exports from the super-productive farms of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Russia's blockading of over 20 million tons of
grain in Ukraine threatens to turn an international food crisis into a
hunger emergency for countries in North Africa and the Middle East that
are most reliant on Ukrainian supplies.

Before Russia\'s invasion, 90 percent of Ukraine\'s exports went through
Black Sea ports such as Odesa and Mariupol. But the war has destroyed
Mariupol and forced Ukrainian authorities to lay defensive mines around
Odesa in preparation for a feared Russian attack.

The United Nations [is pushing](https://www.politico.eu/?p=2127211) to
open a protected shipping lane in the Black Sea to allow the country to
export significant volumes again. But officials in Kyiv, [as well as
Western governments](https://www.politico.eu/?p=2122298), are suspicious
that Russia will take advantage of opening the Odesa port to launch an
attack.

[On Tuesday, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi hinted that a
breakthrough could be close. He said a potential deal **could be done
which would not require Ukraine to remove the mines**, and that an
agreement was mainly contingent on \"a final yes from the
Kremlin.\"]{.underline}
He [cited](https://www.politico.eu/?p=2149037) information from U.N.
Secretary-General António Guterres, who briefed G7 leaders at a summit
earlier this week.

[On Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan voiced his
optimism over the prospects for an agreement]{.underline}, during talks
with U.S. President Joe Biden at the NATO summit in Madrid.

\"We are trying to solve the process with a balancing policy,\" Erdoğan
said, according to [the Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-politics-finland-05bee518928c878dc3c170ff3044fa93).
\"Our hope is that this balance policy will lead to results and allow
the possibility to get grain to countries that are facing shortages
right now through a corridor as soon as possible."

[The Ukrainian official suggested Turkey itself could provide the
necessary security guarantees to Ukrainian grain shipments]{.underline}.
Previously Kyiv has suggested the U.N. could play a role in guaranteeing
the safe passage of commercial shipping in the Black Sea. That idea
seems to have receded.

"U.N. is just brokering the deal," the Ukrainian official said. Now Kyiv
is "looking for \[a\] national-level security guarantee --- from Turkey
or \[another\] state." The official added that most of the countries
that could play such a role "are NATO states."

Explaining the contours of a potential agreement, the official said:
"The idea is to use the itinerary that will not require any changes in
military presence together with coordination via Turkey." The Ukrainian
official confirmed this meant using the routes that don\'t need
de-mining.

Although Draghi told reporters that the talks between Russia, Ukraine
and Turkey were speeding up, the Ukrainian official said that a deal
could be reached "today, or never ... everything depend on politics."
Then again, if the parties reach an "understanding," an agreement could
be completed "within days," the official added.

On Sunday, the Turkish president's spokesperson İbrahim
Kalın [said](https://www.haberturk.com/cumhurbaskanligi-sozcusu-ibrahim-kalin-dan-haberturk-tv-ye-aciklamalar-3472768) it
could take three to four weeks for a deal to be struck and for ships to
start sailing via the safe passage.

Turkey, which has been trying to coordinate negotiations between Russia
and Ukraine, [sent a military
delegation](https://www.reuters.com/world/turkish-team-discuss-black-sea-grain-corridor-russia-this-week-media-2022-06-21/#main-content) to
Moscow last week to negotiate a safe Black Sea passage. Kalın said that
"if both sides agree, we will hold a Turkey-Ukraine-Russia-U.N. meeting
in Istanbul." He added that Ankara hopes to hold the meeting "as soon as
possible."
