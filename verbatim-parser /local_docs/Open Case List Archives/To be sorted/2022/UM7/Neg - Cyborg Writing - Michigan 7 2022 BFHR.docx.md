In his recent book, Normal Life, Dean Spade, a law professor at Seattle
University School of Law and noted transgender activist, criticizes
several law-reform movements, including those to improve prison
conditions, win marriage equality for same-sex couples, and ensure that
hate crimes and antidiscrimination laws include transgender people.
Spade finds fault with LGBTQ rights organizations\' efforts to win
mainstream acceptance, arguing that instead of pursuing an equality
agenda, they should focus on changing \"the distribution of life
chances,\" by \"demand\[ing\] radical redistribution of wealth and an
end to poverty.\" Spade\'s critique has the most force in the context in
which it originated\--calling for an end to what David Garland first
described as mass incarceration, the system many refer to as the
\"prison industrial complex.\" It is less persuasive when applied to the
realm of free-world LGBTQ rights. Spade\'s perspective is shaped by the
prison-abolitionist movement, as well as, he says, by critical race
theory and \"woman of color feminism.\" In 2002, Spade founded the
Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP), which provides free legal services to
transgender and gender nonconforming people, and whose mission,
according to its website (slrp.org/about), is \"to guarantee that all
people are free to self-determine their gender identity and expression,
regardless of income or race, and without facing harassment,
discrimination, or violence.\" Normal Life is rooted in this experience,
and fits comfortably within a series of recent prison-abolitionist works
focusing on the experiences of queer and transgender people, including
Queer (In)Justice: The Criminalization of LGBT People in the United
States (2010), and Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison
Industrial Complex (2011), a collection of essays to which Spade
contributed. Spade writes that his purpose in Normal Life is to describe
a \"critical trans politics \... that demands more than legal
recognition and inclusion.\" Arguing that equality of life chances, or
distributive justice, cannot be achieved through law reform alone, he
calls for a broader agenda: \"prison abolition, the elimination of
poverty, access to full health care, and an end to immigration
enforcement.\" These goals, he submits, \"cannot be conceptualized or
won within the realm of US law.\" Citing the work of critical race
theorist Alan Freeman, Spade questions the focus of antidiscrimination
law on violations of individual rights, which, he argues, tends to
obscure more systemic and structural kinds of disadvantage. Instead of
pursuing a rights-based law reform strategy, Spade writes, the trans
movement should focus on \"population-level operations of power,\" such
as ending mass incarceration. The models he recommends for pursuing
\"transformative change\" will resonate with those familiar with the
work of organizers such as \"rebellious lawyering\" proponent Gerry
Lopez, Brazilian educational reformer Paolo Freire, or civil rights
campaigner Ella Baker: \"\[M\]eaningful change,\" Spade says, \"comes
from below,\" and \"those most directly impacted\" should lead the
fight. Normal Life\'s leftist critique of liberal reform has deep roots
in the history of US social movements. For example, in his book Stories
of Scottsboro, James Goodman describes how, in 1931, during the trial of
the Scottsboro Boys (nine African American teenagers falsely accused of
raping two white women), leaders of the International Labor Defense
(ILD) organization attacked the NAACP as \"an instrument of the white
capitalist class for the perpetuation of the slavery of the negro
people.\" ILD members marched with signs equating \"lynchers, reformers,
and enemies of the Negro people.\" Then as now, leftists viewed the
racialized criminal-punishment system as a tool of broader economic
oppression. Spade writes that advocates seeking to remedy prison
conditions should beware of inadvertently strengthening the prison
system. He explains: We must avoid proposals that include constructing
buildings or facilities to house trans prisoners, to hire new staff, or
make any other changes that would expand the budget and/or imprisoning
capacities of the punishment system. He goes on to say, \"\[W\]e must
ensure that legal work is always aimed at dismantling the prison
industrial complex \... \[k\]nowing that the system is likely to try to
co-opt our critiques to produce opportunities for expansion.\" This is
essentially [the [criticism of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}prison
[[reform]{.underline}]{.mark} leveled by Angela Y. Davis in her 2003
book, Are Prisons Obsolete? She [[argues]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} despite the good intentions of
advocates, prison reform can produce more prisons\--new and sanitized
versions built to reduce overcrowding. Davis warns that discussions of
prison reform focus \"almost inevitably on generating the changes that
will produce a better prison system.\" Although some reforms may be
significant, she writes, [[\"frameworks that rely]{.underline}]{.mark}
exclusively on [[reforms]{.underline}]{.mark} help to [[produce
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [stultifying [idea that nothing lies beyond
]{.mark}]{.underline}prison.\" It is not only prison abolitionists who
share Spade\'s concern about the unintended consequences of prison
[[reform.]{.underline}]{.mark} The sociologist Heather Schoenfeld writes
that prison-conditions litigation in Florida contributed to a prison
building boom there. Other commentators\--including James Jacobs,
Malcolm Feeley, and Van Swearingen\--argue that prisoners\' rights
litigation contributed to the \"bureaucratization\" of prisons,
consolidating administrators\' power even as it asserted prisoners\'
rights. Examples of double-edged US criminal-punishment reforms extend
well beyond prison conditions. As described by Kate Stith and Steve Y.
Koh (in \"The Politics of Sentencing Reform: The Legislative History of
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,\" Wake Forest Law Review, 1993), some
of the initial proponents of federal sentencing guidelines were liberal
academics and judges, who wanted to rationalize sentencing to make it
fairer and more consistent. **[Unfortunately,]{.underline}** as
innumerable commentators have recounted, the implementation of the
guidelines produced draconian sentences, ultimately contributing to the
growth of US prisons. In [**adopting [an all-or-nothing
approach]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} however]{.underline}, Spade [[fails to
acknowledge]{.mark} ways]{.underline} [in which]{.underline} the
[[liberal]{.underline}]{.mark} prisoners\' rights [[movement has
**helped**]{.underline} ]{.mark}to advance critical trans
politics**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** At a minimum, prison-reform
litigation generated information, through civil discovery, that
advocates used to draw attention to prison conditions.
[Access]{.underline} to prisoners [has been facilitated by]{.underline}
the minimal [legal protections]{.underline} and professional norms that
the prisoners\' rights movement helped to achieve. **[[Rather than
undermining]{.mark} the [radical project]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
Spade promotes**[[, liberal]{.mark} law-[reform
]{.mark}]{.underline}**efforts arguably **[[laid foundations
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
prison-**[[abolition]{.underline}]{.mark}**ist
[movement**[.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As for hate crimes prohibitions,
Spade writes that they \"strengthen and legitimize the criminal
punishment system,\" which targets poor people of color and singles out
poor trans people of color for particular harassment. \"Changing what
the law explicitly says about a group,\" he points out, \"does not
necessarily remedy the structured insecurity faced by that group.\" We
ourselves are agnostic on the question of hate crimes penalties for
crimes against LGBTQ people: the exclusion of sexual orientation and
gender identity from existing laws not only minimizes the seriousness of
anti-LGBTQ violence but also nearly guarantees a dearth of law
enforcement resources. Nevertheless, we are also acutely aware of the
danger of expanding the already massive criminal-punishment system in
any way. [In the context of mass incarceration, in which reform can
produce]{.underline} ever cleaner and [more]{.underline} technologically
[advanced human warehouses]{.underline}, Spade\'s arguments are
well-taken. His critique is less persuasive when he moves into the
broader arena of LGBTQ rights. Spade believes that law reform is at odds
with distributive justice. In his view, advocacy that departs from the
idealized approach he champions harms the transgender community. While
we laud his critique of some elements of liberal law reform, **[[we
disagree with]{.underline}]{.mark}** his **[[zero-sum
frame.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Law [reform]{.mark}]{.underline} is only
one piece of a strategy. It cannot achieve everything, but it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes [[**a necessary precondition** to
reach]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [other]{.underline}
[[goals]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and,]{.mark} at a minimum, **[is not a
causative element for diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**opportunities** and [**status**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [A]{.underline}
transgender equality [movement that includes **expansion**
of]{.underline} antidiscrimination **[laws]{.underline}** and marriage
equality [among its goals **is coextensive with** the project of
**\"transformative change**.\"]{.underline} Spade argues that
antidiscrimination [laws \"create the false impression that]{.underline}
\... [fairness has been imposed, and]{.underline} the
[legitimacy]{.underline} of the distribution of life chances
[restored.]{.underline}\" [But such protections merely
ensure]{.underline} that a person\'s sexual orientation or [gender
identity cannot be an obvious basis for an adverse employment
action.]{.underline} They are nowhere near broad enough to promise
substantive equality, for transgender people or anyone else. However,
**[[excluding gender identity]{.underline}]{.mark}** and sexual
orientation [[from existing]{.underline}]{.mark} employment
**[[protections is far more damaging]{.underline}]{.mark}** than
committing the resources for the advocacy required to expand them. In
addition, [organizing to pass]{.underline} [antidiscrimination laws has
activated and radicalized LGBTQ advocacy organizations]{.underline}. The
California-based Transgender Law Center (incubated by the National
Center for Lesbian Rights) and the Massachusetts Transgender Political
Coalition (first envisioned by GLAD staff members and interns) are two
examples of the generativity of liberal law reform efforts. Both
organizations share many of the distributive justice goals of SRLP.
Spade is not the first to criticize the movement for marriage equality
for same-sex couples. In \"Arguing Against Arguing for Marriage\"
(University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 2010), Shannon Gilreath claims
that \"marriage is dangerous for Gays conceptually, in its patriarchal
and heteropatriarchical foundations.\" In less absolute terms, Katherine
Franke writes in the New York Times (June 23, 2011) that same-sex
marriage is a \"mixed blessing,\" which may undermine other arrangements
that LGBTQ people have used to \"order our lives in ways that have given
us greater freedom than can be found in the one-size-fits-all rules of
marriage.\" Spade goes too far in applying the same critique to both
prison reform and marriage equality. Removing gender discrimination from
the institution of marriage does not strengthen it in the way that
modifying the criminal-punishment system reinforces mass incarceration.
The institution of marriage has an evolving social meaning. Extending it
to lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgender people reaffirms our
human dignity. Even the most steadfast [[critics]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the marriage-equality movement\--including the lesbian activists and law
professors Nancy Polikoff and the late Paula Ettelbrick\--have
acknowledged that critiques of marriage and the marriage equality
movement need not be on a collision course. In addition, Spade
[[ignore]{.underline}]{.mark}s []{.mark}[law-reform efforts]{.underline}
[spearheaded by LGBTQ]{.underline} legal [organizations]{.underline}
other than those focused on hate crimes, anti-discrimination, and
marriage. [These include **challenges to [discriminatory health care
access]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} to **[prison regulations
that deny [essential]{.mark} medical [care to
trans]{.mark}]{.underline}**gender **[[inmates]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
**[immigration reform advocacy]{.underline}**; [[and]{.mark} [support
for]{.mark} trans]{.underline}gender [students and [homeless LGBTQ
youth.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[To ignore these]{.mark} efforts [is to

#### The claim that reform, or learning about it, produces queer subjects in any structurally predictive way actually [inhibits queer becoming]{.underline}\-\--particular demands for reform [enables queer flourishing]{.underline}

**Greteman 18**---Department of Art Education, School of the Art
Institute of Chicago (Adam, "Introduction: An Opening for Queer
Thriving," *Sexualities and Genders in Education* pp 1-35, springer,
dml)

I begin with this general sense of queer youth and the complicated
relationship they have to queer adults to draw attention to the everyday
complexities that go into being and becoming queer in the twenty-first
century. It is, to put it simply, not a straightforward process or
experience. I forgo specificity to think broadly about the diverse ways
in which [[queer youth, in **varied contexts**]{.mark} and
**realities**, are]{.underline} generally going about their day and
becoming in relationship to the broader worlds they inhabit. They are,
by means of being youth, [going about their days [think]{.mark}ing [less
about]{.mark} many of [the issues queer scholars]{.mark}
engage]{.underline}---including myself in the coming pages---[[and more
about the possibilities and limitations]{.mark} that lie before them.
They, with their youthful zest, see a world **filled with potential**
and **possibility**[. It is **not a perfect world**]{.mark}, as queer
youth inching toward an explicit queer relation to the world are **[far
from ignorant]{.mark}** of the issues queerness raises in and for their
lives. However, it is a world that [they are **increasingly sure** they
have a **right to** ]{.mark}**inhabit**, [**engage**, and
**transform**]{.mark}. They are, unlike other generations, **asserting
themselves earlier in life** and, as such, could **benefit from queer
opportunities** that **connect them with queer
generations**]{.underline} (a topic for the next chapter).

This is, for me, a hopeful image of queer youth and an image that I try
to hold with me in my own daily engagements where conversations, by and
large, focus on queer youth as victims. It is also the image that
propels the purpose of this book---a book that as you will read builds
upon decades of queer scholarship that has pushed and prodded the world
to become kinder to queers (to put it quite simply). After decades of
generating queer scholarship that honors (often perversely) queerness,
emerging generations have expanded opportunities to come into presence.
To be clear, while I hold this image of queer youth with me, this book
is not about queer youth, but about the histories and futures of queer
realities that were once youthful and a push for recognizing unseen
queer potentials in the youth of the future. This may, for some, sound a
bit wishy-washy. The lack of specificity might read unsure or unaware of
the specific challenges and realities queer youth and adults face in the
present. And this may be the case---I am not an expert in specific
realities beyond my own and those within my vicinity. My refusal to
specify here is a recognition that queerness---at its heart---is ever
shifting and difficult to pin down. Any specific mention of a queer
youth, for instance, one who became prom king (or queen) or one who
recently committed suicide, would already begin to foreclose other queer
possibilities and the complexities therein. For me, the move to specify
also feels like a move to use a queer youth to make an argument. I sense
queer youth---particularly queer youth who are victimized, bullied, or
commit suicide---are taken up in the grind of the media and academy to
become a "cause," often simplified or reduced to a particular talking
point. There is, to be sure, a political salience to this and one I
myself will take up on several occasions. However, I begin with and
honor the general because for me it is helpful in allowing readers to
read in their own specifics, in their own contexts, given the diversity
of experiences and intersectional realities of our lives. Additionally,
I am a "generalist" in education, so I tend toward the general "big
picture," leaving specificity to those more suited to such work. For
now, as readers, hopeful queers might see their optimism reflected back
at them, but with a recognition that there is work to be done; while
pessimistic queers might scoff at such optimism while secretly realizing
the world can (and should) be different. Bored queers may simply remain
bored, bored by the incessant academizing of queer experiences. But,
back to the issues at hand---childhood, children, and queerness.

When I was a child, Whitney Houston taught me that it was her belief
"the children are our future."1 It was an important lesson for me as a
child, because I was allowed to imagine the future. I was the future and
it was important to teach me well so that I, and other children, could
lead the way in that, what seemed then, rather distant future. The
future is, to be sure, a rather complicated concept. I am here in the
future of my then-imagined childhood, although it is both more and less
fabulous than I could have imagined. The future is always there, in the
distance, and there are always more children for whom that future is.
However, which children are allowed to be children and have a future is,
as significant scholarship has shown, quite narrow (Greteman &
Wojcikiewicz, 2014; Letts & Sears, 1999; Meiners, 2017; Pritchard, 2013;
Weems, 1999).

Children, particularly queer children, and the future have been
something educational scholars and queer theorists have contemplated for
some time. In this chapter, I assemble some of the ways in which queer
children and the future have been contemplated to build upon such work
in further elucidating what I am calling "queer thrival." If children
are our future---and in some sense, they always are---the ways in which
we imagine or are allowed to imagine both "children" and the "future"
greatly impact the ways in which those very concepts come to function in
our daily work, particularly in education. In assembling previous work
addressing children, the future, and queerness, I attend closely to such
work that exposed---through their paranoia---the violence, the limits,
and challenges faced by queerness in education. Such paranoia has been
central in recognizing the challenges queer youth face, yet changes have
happened that would do well to be engaged to not only push for the
safety of queer youth, but their ability to thrive. We need, to harken
back to the last chapter, heterogeneous reading practices that recognize
the contributions of paranoid readings while opening space for
contingently, reparative readings and their possibilities.

Queerness and Challenges to Liberalism

The challenge of children "growing up" is central to the work of schools
where children are presumably taught well to lead the way when they
become "grownups." We know for sure, however, that many students are not
taught well and are never able to lead the way due to any number of
cultural, institutional, interpersonal, and disciplinary barriers
(Collins, 2010). Students that are in such a marginalized position are,
at the same time, more often than not, the students that push the
limits, demanding recognition and access through various means---be that
walk-outs, protests, or other forms of resistance. It is in fact, as we
have seen since desegregation, children who lead the way into hostile
environments so that the future has the possibility of being different.
While there are demands to protect children and arguments made "for
their own good," I suspect history shows us that children, when faced
with adversity, are able to survive and thrive, leading the way not
there in some imagined future but in their present, as they demand they
have a future. This is not meant to romanticize children or childhood,
but to call attention to the material lives of children who we have
historically seen push the limits of democratic liberalism.

Cris Mayo (2006) recognized the need to push the limits of liberalism in
education because, "liberalism has been suspiciously unwilling to extend
its analysis of freedom to sexual freedom, its embrace of autonomy to
queer critique, its sense of progression toward new possibilities to
queer futurities" (p. 471). Liberalism, to put it bluntly, has been
uninterested in queerness. In liberal discourses, as Mayo noted,

There is a tension between discussing how people, such as lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) people, might be recognized by law and
given (or denied) certain legal rights on the basis of their identity
and how queer people, not always fully recognizable as inhabiting
particular identity categories, might also live their potentials. (p.
469)

Liberalism requires recognizable identities by which to protect. Recent
gains in LGBT rights illustrate this requirement as LGBT persons have
gained rights and recognitions, be it to marriage, the military, or
anti-discrimination. Yet, queer---as a political stance---is tasked with
pushing against such recognitions and norms (Ford, 2007). LGBT people
are a voting block more and more recognized through LGBT advocacy
groups. Queer people, on the other hand, fall outside and beyond such
recognitions to illustrate the persistence of exclusion and the
possibility for alternatives. Or, as Puar (2007) illustrated, LGBT
rights can be used as a cudgel against other queer forms of being.

Mayo focused part of her argument on the issue of gay marriage as a
struggle for access to a particular liberal institution. While gay
marriage may be, from certain queer vantage points, quite conservative,
on an educational level, it is an issue that opened some possibilities
for queer students in seeing a queer future. "The drawback," Mayo (2006)
noted, " paralleling gay rights with marriage rights is that while kids
may eventually decide to enter into unions, that is not the only form of
gay (or, for that matter, heterosexual) life open to them" (p. 485).
However, something is better than nothing, particularly because no
"thing" can encapsulate all queer possibilities. The issue is that some
things become sanctioned by the state and, in becoming so, present a
double-edged sword---both providing approval for types of relationships
while also imposing a penalty on those who refuse such approval. To be
sure, any given time will see some battles waged as they gain traction
(and funding) while others unable to break through. [The
task]{.underline}, particularly [for education]{.underline}, [is to
**grapple with broadening possibilities**, both those **limited in
scope** and those **more radical**. This]{.underline}, however,
[**cannot be done without the insights** and **views of youth
themselves**. We need to **provide youth more agency in decision
making**, **not less**, particularly if they are, themselves, "**our
future**."]{.underline} As Mayo noted, ["**[access to queer]{.mark}
possibilities** and **[futures]{.mark}**]{.underline} is not just a
right crucial to queer adults, it [[is **critical to** ]{.mark}**queer
[youth]{.mark}**, for their **current [flourishing]{.mark}** [as well
as]{.mark} for their **[future participation]{.mark}** in communities
and as citizens"]{.underline} (p. 486).

[Queer [youth and adults **cannot only access narratives of**
]{.mark}**their [marginalization]{.mark}**. [Such narratives
inform]{.mark} them, more often than not, that [there is **no
future**]{.mark}. Yes, it is true that for **most of education's recent
past**, queer children have been **denied access to representations**
and **access to queer futures**, but [with the **explosion of**
]{.mark}**youth [expression]{.mark}** on social media and elsewhere,
[such denials look]{.mark} **more** and **more
[outdated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Queer youth have faced innumerous
forms of physical violence and emotional turmoil]{.underline}, as
illustrated by, for instance, GLSEN's School Climate Research, for close
to 20 years. [However, [there is need to **address such research** and
**push beyond it**]{.mark}, **not to deny such realities** but **[work
to change them]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Thorpe & Greteman, 2015).
"Arguably ," Mayo (2006) concluded:

[queer communities are **populated by paradigmatically modern
citizens**]{.underline}, and, as much as one may tire of citing dire
statistics and want instead to point to innovations and resiliency among
queer youth, [it **remains a fact** that]{.underline} liberal theory and
[[the liberal state **need to provide more support for queer
possibilities**,]{.mark} through **education** and **other
institutions**]{.underline}, and to recognize the particular challenge
to traditional family forms, autonomy, and sexuality that queer youth
bring. (p. 487)

[The liberal state]{.underline}---whether one cites dire statistics or
examples of resiliency---[has **work to do**. The future for queerness
has **looked rather grim for some time**]{.underline}, in part, [because
the liberal state has **failed to attend to queer possibilities** and
**institutional support**. However, [queerness has]{.mark} also
**[survived]{.mark} into** and **[against such threats]{.mark}** and
**assaults**. It has **benefited from the liberal state's slow
movement** while **continuing its slow march demanding that queerness
stays**]{.underline}.

Kevin McDonough (2007), took up Mayo's challenges to liberalism and
explored the possibility of liberalism in addressing the challenges that
queer youth raise for schools. "Can the common school ideal, and the
liberal political principles that underwrite it," McDonough (2007)
asked, "coherently accommodate reasonable and legitimate forms of moral
and cultural diversity, especially those forms that have historically
been marginalized, discriminated against, or excluded" (p. 795)? The
demands of queer people and queer communities have, for decades now,
pushed up against the liberal political principles that ground American
public education. And these demands have over those very decades seen
some progress in achieving some forms of recognition and rights.

McDonough is, however, skeptical of an uncritical embrace of queer
recognition for fear that such an embrace will get "distorted into forms
that are both anti-liberal and against the best interests of queer
children" (p. 797). This is a key skepticism, as he argued, given that

if identities are poorly understood then the danger may arise that
schools will socialise children into pre-existing moulds based on
educators' distorted and inauthentic conception of what a queer identity
should be, rather than leaving children free to choose and endorse their
own conceptions of queerness through an examination of how queer people
actually might live worthwhile lives. (p. 797)

One of the matters at hand, for McDonough, is not limiting the queerness
of children to those that are imagined to potentially grow up to be
queer adults. "It is precisely because we cannot pick out beforehand
which children will be \[queer\]," he maintained, "that all children
require exposure to alternative models of identity, including queer
models, upon which to base their individual sexual identities" (p. 798).
No one, as we remember from the introduction, is born queer. Rather, one
must decide to become queer and such a decision requires lessons in such
matters.

Queerness is then a matter that must be visible to all as a possible way
of becoming in the world, recognizing that there are also other ways of
becoming in the world, often that are yet known, to be created by new
generations. The simple task, in all of this, may be that the rule of
becoming is that we shouldn't be mean to those who decide to live and
join and create the diverse possible ways of being and becoming in the
world. This was a lesson Kate Bornstein offered in her contribution to
the "It Gets Better Campaign" started in 2010 after a spate of queer
youth suicides. While there have been important critiques of this
project (see Gilbert, 2014), Bornstein refused to tell youth "it gets
better" because she is not sure it does. Rather, she offered youth
advice to stay alive to find out if it would, the one rule being "don't
be mean." Of course, such a simple task is not in fact that simple, as
all kinds of institutional, structural, cultural, and interpersonal
barriers emerge that impact the lives of those who become in ways
rarely, if at all, recognized. Meanness seems to be more palatable and
easier to engage in than kindness. After all, we do prefer Mean Girls,
which ironically ends quite kindly.

McDonough's argument developed a prima facie reason that [queer
[children's autonomy "**depend\[s\] on actual engagement**]{.mark}
**with queer options**"]{.underline} (p. 800). [It is
**necessary**]{.underline}, in other words, [[that queer children **gain
access to queer options** in order to **imagine possible futures**. To
not have such access **denies**]{.mark} **children opportunities** to
encounter a **[wide range of possibilities]{.mark}** by which to
**develop** and **see their own futures**]{.underline}. Quoting
McDonough:

[If]{.underline} the [communities]{.underline} of which children are a
part (here I do not just mean those children who turn out to be queer,
but all children) [**fail to include expansive visions of queer
possibilities**, then the ability of queer children]{.underline} (i.e.
those who turn out to be unable to live their lives as heterosexuals)
[to **develop into independent practical reasoners** will be
**constrained** to the extent that they will be **unable to link up
their reasoning** to **realistic** and **expansive** '**imagined
futures**' [involving **valuable**]{.mark} and **worthwhile queer
[roles]{.mark}**, **communities**, and **identities**]{.underline}. (p.
801)

His argument that expansive possibilities are necessary, particularly
for liberal education, connects us back to the subjectification function
of education. [Schools **inevitably play a significant role** in the
ways students can **imagine their futures**. And for much of the history
of American public education, what futures are open to students has been
**limited**.]{.underline}

[When it comes to providing students]{.underline}---queer and
otherwise---[**actual engagement** with queer]{.underline} roles,
communities, and [identities]{.underline}, however, [a number of issues
have emerged]{.underline}. For McDonough these included the reality that
queer communities are often few and far between and located primarily in
urban areas; that queer communities are often viewed disapprovingly by
parents and society; and that queer children often come from families
that are disapproving of queerness (p. 802). [Such issues
are]{.underline}, I sense, [still present, but]{.underline} I want to
suggest that [[there have been **gains in accessibility** to]{.mark}
engaging queer roles, [communities]{.mark}, and identities]{.underline}.
It is, in fact, one of the purposes of this book to highlight [such
gains]{.underline} in order to [**further push for** and **cultivate
ways** in which schools could **provide queer lessons** for their
students]{.underline}. It may be, in part, following Airton's (2013)
advice---more fully addressed shortly---to "leave 'those kids' alone"
(p. 532).

Diverse queer lessons are, for me, less about reiterating the data that
illustrates "hatred in the hallways" or reproducing the paranoid
arguments that queer students and teachers have enemies. We've been
hearing that for decades . Eric Rofes (1983), in "I Thought People Like
That Killed Themselves": Lesbians, Gay Men, and Suicide, offered an
assessment of then emerging discourses on suicide and homosexuality.
"Perhaps the most pernicious trick played on lesbians and gay men,"
according to Rofes , "has been the creation of the dual myth of
homosexual suicide" (p. 1). This dual myth "asserts that lesbians and
gay men not only commit suicide at a rate higher than society-at-large,
but that somehow a person's homosexuality is itself the source of
self-destruction" (p. 1). Rofes , to be clear, is not contesting the
reality of "gay" suicide, but drawing the reader's attention to the ways
in which arguments centered on suicide and homosexuality are intimately
tied to the discourses of the time, particularly those of the medical
profession and media. The futures that were visible to queer people
(then defined largely as gay and lesbian) were quite narrow. The gay
liberation movement was little over a decade old and the known AIDS
epidemic in its infancy. The social world, with its homophobia and
violence against queer people---notably through expert discourses---was
literally killing queers, but blaming such deaths on queer individuals.
Rofes refused such a place for gay men and lesbians, offering insights
on intervention, postvention, and prevention for the living taken from
the dead.

Such queer lessons were, returning to McDonough, provided in recognition
that [[to envision "queer futures," there are **things**]{.mark} **that
[education]{.mark} can** and **[should
do]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [both in **making sure queer youth
survive** the precariousness of childhood and **can

that, to go back to Mayo's earlier comment, needs to provide support to
queer youth---be this at the K-12 level or higher education. [Schools,

continue]{.underline}---despite or in spite of neoliberal
rationalities---[to be spaces where **futures can be envisioned**. It
is]{.underline}, to be sure, [a **challenge to broaden such futures**
given neoliberal rationalities, but **try we must**]{.underline}.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Queer Sameness

#### The fetishization of difference ironically collapses into a singular sameness, as the dominant culture's white supremacy comes to regulate queerness into an ideal. This works to mystify racial and colonial violence, furthering marginalizing people of color.

**Perez 5** \[Hiram, Associate Professor of English at Vassar College,
"You Can Have My Brown Body and Eat It, Too!" *Social Text* 23.3/4
(Fall/Winter 2005): 171-191\]

The category \"Latino,\" used as a racial descriptor rather than a
political affiliation, is nearly as vague as \"brown.\" Consider, for
example, how easily \"Latin\" (or for that matter, \"Spanish\" and
\"Hispanic\") may substitute for \"Latino.\" However, most uses of
\"Latina/o\" disregard the politics of that ambiguity, together with the
differences that the category itself already collapses. Remarkably,
queer theory understands the politics of difference as fundamental to
its practice, yet it can participate in the circulation of categories
like \"Latin\" without appreciating in the least its function within a
complex web of identifications and desires. While the variations on the
category \"Latina/o\" collapse innumerable differences, queer theorizing
seems for the most part quite content to let that sameness alone.
[\"[Queer\" needs to interrogate its own investments in
sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ironically, [these investments deploy the
rhetoric of difference precisely so that the presumed anti-identity of
queer might dissimulate profiting by sameness]{.underline}. By this
means, [[establishmentarian queer theory has colluded in rendering
material and psychic violences of racialization
unintelligible]{.underline}.]{.mark} I agree that [communities are bound
by fictions, but that does not diminish the violences enacted in
constituting those communities. Queer theory has exchanged]{.underline}
too hastily [the politics of identity for the politics of difference.
[To combat oppression it is necessary to theorize how communities are
bound by shared]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}fantasies and [desires, in
other words, how they are bound at some level by sameness. This is
especially crucial where sameness makes itself transparent, as it does
with whiteness]{.underline}. Sometimes, people are not so different from
one another. [[Queer theory, when it privileges difference over sameness
absolutely, colludes with institutionalized racism in vanishing, hence
retrenching, white privilege. **It serves as the magician\'s assistant
to whiteness\'s disappearing act.**]{.underline} ]{.mark}Hanson
acknowledged that he had anticipated my response and had heard exactly
the same protest before. Oddly, these repeated protests only invalidate
one another. I should in fact feel shamed at this revelation of the
commonplace nature of my thinking. Hanson\'s accusation constitutes a
defensive posture, a way to dismiss criticism. However, I think the
solace I received (much of it from white lesbian theorists) may
similarly indicate a form of defensiveness. I absolutely experienced
solidarity with white lesbian theorists at the conference, but there was
also from some an expression of solace that I think masqueraded (and
only just barely) as solidarity.231 am sure that reactions to the
dispute between Hanson and me had to have been more complicated than the
(apparent) polarization, the taking of sides that occurred after the
final roundtable. But I also wonder if that\] (apparent) polarization
did not in fact need to happen to preserve the status quo, to further
bind queer theory\'s white indivisibility. As I alternately inhabited
the body of an intransigent and vulgar savage as well as that of a noble
one (depending on where you sat), as I performed my brownness---and what
choice did I have really, fated to my performance of the unsophisticated
and banal---I understood the rupture I witnessed as one that needed to
happen in order to fortify that white body of queer theory, to
strengthen its immunity against foreign agents. I did experience genuine
intellectual engagement with colleagues. Otherwise, I would not waste my
energy formulating this critique. However, that engagement was subsumed
by a reductive polarization; like the brown body (poor Mario\'s,
Kiko\'s, my own, and, most important, the brown body missing in action),
it was an obligatory sacrifice to the status quo of Gay Shame\'s queer
theorizing. Although the ironies of Ellis Hanson\'s presentation were
lost on me, I was keenly aware of another much crueler irony. The brown
body in his schoolboy uniform, invited into the university classroom of
a cosmopolitan gay male fantasy for a game of show and tell, remains
simultaneously shut out of the university classroom. Increasingly, [the
brown body finds itself expelled from civil society---if not expelled
outright from the nation]{.underline}. Seeing Kiko up on the screen, his
dick hanging out of his khaki shorts, made the absence of gay men and
lesbians of color at the conference all that much more pronounced. [The
brown body is variously sacrificed at the exigencies of white privilege
and white desire]{.underline}. As peculiar as this may sound, [[I am not
convinced that institutionalized forms of queer theory really care to
investigate desire]{.underline}]{.mark}. An established group of queer
theorists remain quite riled, understandably, about the normalization of
queer. However, [[queer theory resists the critique of its
own]{.underline}]{.mark} even more [[alarming normalizations. The
dominant queer culture, like any dominant culture, demands assimilation.
Queer theory does not want]{.underline}]{.mark} to be normalized, but
neither does it want [[to be queered.]{.mark} Unruly subjects are
expelled to its margins]{.underline}. This expulsion is telling.
Establishmentarian [[queer theory]{.mark}, despite its]{.underline}
oft-professed [revulsion at mass culture assimilation,
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}also quite [[comfortably settled
at]{.underline}]{.mark} the center or, rather, [[that comfortably
furnished space just left of center]{.underline}]{.mark}. We would be
deluded to think that queer theory is not invested in protecting the
institutional structures that have accommodated it, including, most
significantly, white patriarchal structures of knowledge. This does not
call for abandoning the field but rather for greater vigilance,
imagination, and accountability, as well as a reinvigorated inquiry into
the complex trajectories of desire and identity.

[[Before]{.mark} the [colonization]{.mark} of this land, [there
were]{.mark} as [many]{.mark} as six traditional [gender]{.mark}
orientation [roles among numerous tribes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cameron,
124). [However, due to boarding schools erasing these traditions through
the [Christianization]{.mark} of those who would later become the Elders
within our community, the Christianized [related the]{.mark} existence
of the [Two-Spirit as sin]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cameron,124) and [this
is because we have internalized the dominant culture's concepts of
gender and sexuality]{.underline} (Driskill, 55[). [The Western Gender
Binary is]{.mark} thus [superimposed upon all cultures and their
histories seen through]{.mark}]{.underline} the gaze of [not only male
dominance but [a male/female paradigm that does not account for the
existence of]{.mark} third, fourth, fifth and even more [varieties of
non-male/female]{.mark} expressions and [identities.]{.mark}
Colonization, as previously elaborated upon, brought to Indigenous
societies the patriarchy and beliefs of natural male
dominance]{.underline}. But an overlooked aspect of the patriarchy -
this Western gender binary, also found its way impacting Indigenous
thought through the process of colonization[. [The Western Gender Binary
does not see the Two-Spirit,]{.mark} the Western Gender Binary only sees
a Man acting in "Unmanly" ways or a Woman acting in "Unwomanly"
ways.]{.underline} What has resulted from this has been our very own
communities becoming hostile to Gay, Lesbian, Bi/Pan, Trans\* and
Two-Spirit Indigenous peoples due to the influence of violent and
assimilative colonialism. Many of these people not being accepted by
their own families, by their own tribes, even those with traditions
normalizing their existences. A [further [**demonizing of Native bodies
occurs when the Native refuses to conform to the invading culture's
normative behaviors of gender**]{.mark} expression. The influence of
[Western culture]{.mark} on the erasure of Indigenous "Queer" and Two
-Spirit peoples **[has created a system of sexual assault, homophobia
and transphobia]{.mark}** used against our peoples, entangled with the
history of colonialism]{.underline} (Driskill, 51). As part of the
settler mentality, we can see these actions as colonial violence against
the Two-Spirit (ibid) and are also the results of genocide (Driskill,
52). To reiterate previous statements, [the Western gender binary is a
form of superimposed and universalized colonialism upon Indigenous
bodies and minds]{.underline}. Often, the fight for decolonization fails
to include or may even openly alienate and exclude Indigenous "Queers,"
Two -Spirits, non-cisnormative and non-heteronormative individuals. Even
amongst those attempting post colonialism, the adverse effects of
gendered colonialism finds itself difficult to erase from the
consciousness. Be that as it may one not achieve decolonization without
also including an eradication of the Western gender binary. [Healing our
identities is part of the ongoing process of decolonization (Driskill,
51) [because besides]{.mark} our [land]{.mark}, our [identities are
colonized as well]{.mark} (Driskill, 52) and expressing our identities
as Two-Spirit peoples is to resist colonialist definitions defining who
we are while also proclaiming ourselves sovereign from the identities of
the white dominated LGBTQ rights movement (ibid).]{.underline}
Two-Spirit is a term used to describe our experiences of intersecting
oppressions (race, colonialism, queerness, sexuality transgenderism,
two-spirit identity) and is therefore a culturally specific term which
cannot be transferred into other cultures (Cameron, 126[). [Colonization
operates as a mechanism of white supremacy]{.mark} which as previously
defined is built around paranoia, white solidarity and consensus, white
exclusiveness ("otherizing"), defensiveness, colonial aggression and
violence]{.underline}. As has been described, [white supremacy and
settler-colonialism not only colonizes the bodies of Indigenous peoples,
but their minds as well. This has effectively been done through the
erasure of traditions and introduction of patriarchy imposed upon
Indigenous peoples in the boarding schools.]{.underline} [[Settlers want
the Indigenous]{.mark} person [to "disappear"]{.mark} and history has
shown they've attempted this [not only through physical]{.mark} genocide
[but cultural genocide as well. **This disappearance of Native peoples
includes those often most threatening to patriarchy and Western culture,
the Two-Spirit**.]{.mark} White supremacy through violence has sought
the destruction of the Two-Spirit. White supremacy through paranoia,
considering the Two-Spirit to be sin have sought the destruction of the
Two-Spirit. White supremacy through white solidarity and consensus has
imposed its Western concept of sexuality and gender upon Indigenous
peoples, seeking the destruction of the Two-Spirit.]{.underline}
Assimilation and annihilation have been tools at the hands of the
settler-colonialists to erase Indigenous peoples as people and as a
unique set of cultures residing in the United States. Existing is
therefore resistance.

Foucault and, all too often, **[[queer theory treats]{.mark} the
politics of [non-identity as uniformly accessible]{.mark}, an uncritical
assumption for which both are taken to task]{.underline}**. Foucault is
reproached for the "sexist focus in his work \[that\] cannot be solved
simply by adding women to his analysis" and this exposes the need "to
fundamentally reconsider the way in which his focus on men alone skews
some of \[his\] insights," a need queer theory also frequently ignores
(Mills 2003, 7). For similar sorts of reasons, queer theory is said by
David M. Halperin and Valerie Traub (2009) [to "despecify the lesbian,
gay, bisexual, trangender or transgressive content of queerness, thereby
**[abstracting 'queer' and turning it into a generic badge of
subversiveness]{.mark}, [a]{.mark} more [trendy]{.mark}, [nonnormative
version of 'liberal']{.mark} or 'oppositional'" practice**]{.underline}
(17); **[this observation also has implications for queerness [as an
unconscious mode of whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, [there is
some "alarm over queer theory's wholesale transition from gender to
sexuality as the proper object of its analysis,"]{.underline} as Perez
(2005) has noted while drawing on Judith Butler, because **[queer
theory's increasing neglect of women and gender is not irrelevant to its
neglect of race and vice versa]{.underline}** (173). In part, these
effects are due to the ways Foucault's theories, as queer theories, have
almost completely enframed contemporary queer thought and being.
**[Another problem [queer non-identity politics obfuscates]{.mark} is
[its role in the maintenance of whiteness as a pre-condition for subject
effacement]{.mark}: it entails a [de facto colour-blind]{.mark}
liberalism or [racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [On the one hand,
"'queering' ... is both a protest against foreclosure of possible
inclusion and a demand that the liberal]{.underline} (white, yuppified,
Western) [gay and lesbian establishment recognize the 'subalterns' in
its midst"]{.underline} (Hawley 2001, 6). On the other, **[[it "colludes
with institutionalized racism in vanishing, hence retrenching, white
privilege"]{.mark} simply [because it]{.mark} "[has exchanged]{.mark}
too hastily [the politics of identity for the politics of
difference]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Perez 2005, 187). Like Foucault,
"'\[q\]ueer theory' has promised to complicate assumptions about routes
of identification and desire" (Butler and Martin 1994, 3). **[In
practice]{.underline}**, however, **[[the idea that queerness
presents]{.mark} those [who enter its spaces with the same
opportunity]{.mark} for "limitless anonymous encounters" and subject
effacement, [belies a liberal, colour-blind assumption that people who
enter queer spaces are equally welcomed, desired, and entitled to act on
desire: this is the paradoxical, invisible foundation of
queerness]{.mark}---[it]{.mark} too readily [refuses interruptions of
whiteness at the same time that it opens onto the possibility of (white)
sexual de-subjectification]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Where [queer
anti-identity politics]{.mark} may [afford white queers an opportunity
at effacement, it may not so readily do so for queers of colour]{.mark}
when whiteness dominates queer space]{.underline}**. [And in unique
instances where queer space is not predominantly white, but racialized,
**it can still fail to do so for [Indigenous queers]{.mark}, because
queer spaces [are just as likely to be dominated by the broad
unconsciousness of settlers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Andrea Smith
(2011) argues, [what can also "disappear within queer theory's
subjectless critique \[is\] **settler colonialism and the ongoing
genocide of Native peoples** ... **[queer theory]{.mark} (even queer of
color critique), then, [rests on the presumption of the]{.mark} U.S.
[settler colonial state]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (47). Sara Ahmed (2010)
writes that "[\[y\]ou learn to see yourself as you are seen by those who
can inhabit the familiar, because they can recede into its
form]{.underline}" (86). [Where the queer familiar is white and/or
settled, queers who are of colour or Indigenous are less likely to be
seen or allowed to see themselves as equally susceptible to the infinite
possibility of self; their **difference as racialized and [Indigenous
subjects]{.mark} in a queer, white, and settled familiar [will
not]{.mark} be read or [operate as non-identity, because racialized and
Indigenous queerness is visibly qualified in ways that]{.mark} queerness
unqualified (i.e., as [invisible whiteness]{.mark}) [is
not]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, **[the queer condemnation of
visibility politics fails to recognize that [invisibility politics is
still a privilege afforded primarily to white
queers]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Binaries Not Violent

**Binaries aren't inherently violent**

**Carson 9** -- PhD in English @ Toronto and MA @ Queen's, Associate
Professor of English -- since 2008 - at Hobart and William Smith
Colleges (Rob, "DIGESTING THE THIRD: RECONFIGURING BINARIES IN
SHAKESPEARE AND EARLY MODERN THOUGHT,"
https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17736/1/Carson_Robert_B_200906_PhD_thesis.pdf)

There seems to be a widespread consensus among current literary critics
that there is a problem with binaries, so much so that even the word
\"binary\" itself has taken on a strong pejorative connotation. To begin
with, then, I should go on the record as saying that even though the
hemiolic strategy that I develop in this chapter sets out to redescribe
binary structures using ternary strategies, **[[I am by no means opposed
to all binaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[whatsoever. Many of them, in
fact, seem to me to be entirely unproblematic, i]{.underline}**f not
wholly indispensable: for example, [[I have no
misgivings]{.underline}]{.mark} at all [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} it
comes to flipping [[light-switches]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[place
\"off\" and \"on\"]{.mark} in binary opposition]{.underline} to each
other**[; I am not at all concerned that my computer saves my work in an
enormous chain of [1's and 0's]{.mark}; I feel no compulsion to seek out
creative alternatives to \"[heads\" or \"tails\"]{.mark} during a
coin-toss; and so]{.underline}** on. [[The world is
full]{.underline}]{.mark} of a great [[many]{.underline}]{.mark} wholly
**[[sensible binary oppositions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I suggest,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[one]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[shortcoming]{.underline}]{.mark}s that I [frequent]{.underline}ly find
[[in]{.mark} post-structural]{.underline}ist [and deconstructive
[critiques]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of binary thinking
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[knee-jerk]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[or even
[essentialist]{.mark}?)]{.underline}** [[assumption]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[that binaries are]{.underline}]{.mark} [[somehow]{.mark} problematic
[\"violent]{.mark} hierarchies[\"]{.mark}]{.underline} by their very
nature. Furthermore, I think it is important to acknowledge that the
term \"binaries\" is used to represent quite a varied range of dyads:
not just dichotomous oppositions, but also more open-ended competing
alternatives, and even at times dyads that seem to me to be wholly
complementary pairs of ideas. We might see a confusion of this sort, I
suggest, at the core of Anna Maria Cimitile\'s argument in Shakespearean
Orders, which offers a deconstructive reading of how Shakespeare\'s
plays subvert a whole range of binaries that she envisions as being
parallel to one another, including nature and culture, good and evil,
justice and mercy, matter and spirit, filiation and usurpation, and
commerce and law (23). I would argue in response that there seem to be
crucial differences to be found between these dyads. Good and evil, for
example, quite clearly form a dichotomous binary opposition, whereas
justice and mercy seem to present us with a much more ambiguous pair of
partly-competing alternatives, and commerce and law in turn seem to be
little more than two vaguely related concepts that Cimitile considers
alongside each other. Surely, I suggest, these dyads are not all
\"binaries\" in the same way, structured on a model of presence and
absence. [I greatly appreciate the work that the past generation of
critical theorists has done]{.underline} in drawing attention to the
ways in which violent hierarchies of social power are often constructed
and maintained through particular binary oppositions in **[language.
However, at]{.underline}** the same time, [I am far from persuaded by
the strategies that]{.underline} both the [post-structuralists and the
deconstructivists have adopted]{.underline} in their attempts to address
this concern. It seems to me that [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [usual
post-structuralist]{.underline} [[strategy of **inverting
binaries**]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to privilege whatever position
had previously been marginalized]{.underline} [[does **little** to
overcome the problem]{.underline}]{.mark} [of binaries]{.underline},
[[since the inversion of a binary **preserves it
intact**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[An upside-down binary,]{.mark} after
all, [is undoubtedly still a binary nonetheless]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is, as I understand it, the thrust of the complex and convincing
argument that Derrida develops against Foucault in \"Cogito and the
History of Madness.\" To make the same point much more prosaically,
however, I am reminded of the famous quip that the cartoonist Bob Thaves
made about Ginger Rogers, namely that she was a better dancer than Fred
Astaire because she managed to do everything that he did, only backwards
and in high heels. I sometimes find myself thinking the same thing about
Foucault and Descartes. Foucault, of course, undoubtedly comes across as
the more compelling philosopher as he tackles Enlightenment metaphysics
so daringly and so stylishly, but it seems to me that in the end what
Foucault is doing is very much the same old song and dance that
Descartes did, only backwards and in high heels.9 In cases where binary
thinking really is a problem, the post-structuralist response challenges
the hierarchy within a binary, privileging the marginalized and
validating the undervalued, and although I see this as a worthwhile task
in its own right, I do not see how it enables us to overcome the problem
of the binary itself.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Lesbianism \<3

#### Queer theory collapses lesbian theory and asserts violent hegemony over the knowledge industry -- this reinscribes categories and makes a broad movement impossible

Over the past decade [scholarship on lesbian and gay issues has rapidly
increased not only in scope and size but also in level of acceptance as
\"valid\" research within the academy]{.underline}. Although
lesbian-feminist theory has long been a part of the academic field of
women\'s studies, [only recently has it begun to gain a degree of
critical autonomy]{.underline}, a development that has been attributed
to the need of some lesbian theorists to define their projects over
against those of both feminist theory and the new darling of academia:
\"queer theory.\" [[While lesbian theory diverges]{.mark} in some
important ways [from feminist theory, it\'s opposition with queer
theory]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, I would argue,
[[much greater and more fundamental]{.mark}, to the extent that [the two
may be]{.mark} wholly [incompatible as politically useful theoretical
positions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not all lesbian theorists would agree,
however, as the most recent work on these issues attests; even when
lesbian theorists wholeheartedly embrace queer theory, they are often
reluctant to give up on some of the basic premises of lesbian feminism.
[This]{.underline}, I believe, [suggests that [lesbian-feminism]{.mark}
provides a certain type of social [and political analysis]{.mark} that
[is not available through queer theory,]{.mark} a case I intend to make
through a critical review of some of the scholarship on these issues
produced over the last five years. [Some of the issues that
divide]{.mark} lesbian-feminists and queer theorists [are the very
issues that]{.mark} threatened to [divide lesbians from feminists in the
early stages of the women\'s movement]{.mark}]{.underline}\[1\]. [The
practice of [identity politics]{.mark}, with its concern for the nature
and boundaries of identity]{.underline}, [[has been central to most
social movements of the past few decades]{.mark},]{.underline} with
perhaps the most visible example being that of the Black Power movement.
[Identity politics assumes a coherent, unified, and stable
identity]{.underline} on the basis of which individuals should not be
discriminated against; [while activists concerned with ending racism and
classism have used identity politics with some success, gender and
especially sexuality pose a more difficult problem,]{.underline} as we
will see in the work of both lesbian-feminists and queer theorists.
Another related issue that divides these two critical perspectives is
the nature and function of the sex/gender system[; [for
lesbian-feminists, sex and gender are conceptually interdependent
categories]{.mark}, best exemplified by the institution of compulsory
heterosexuality, but for queer theorists, sex and gender are and must be
conceptually distinct]{.underline}, which opens up the possibility for
an analysis of homophobia that excludes the role of sexism\[2\].
[[Lesbian-feminists and queer theorists]{.mark} also [come to heads
over]{.mark} the meaning of \"[sexual difference]{.mark},\" [the
construction of identities through hierarchical, binary gender roles,
and what it means to be \"anti-normative]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" These
are but some of the issues that scholars have recently taken up, as a
way both of understanding the historical role and importance of
lesbian-feminist theory, and of coming to terms with the emergence of
queer theory. Arlene Stein\'s article, \"Sisters and Queers: the
Decentering of Lesbian Feminism\" (1992), offers a brief but thorough
account of the history and development of lesbian-feminism, as well as
an analysis of the fallout from lesbian feminism\'s recent encounter
with queer theory. According to Stein, the recent increase in lesbian
visibility and diversity has led lesbian feminists to reconceptualize
what is meant by \"lesbian community,\" since it seems more accurate to
refer to lesbian \"communities,\" and to recognize that not all of these
communities will identify as feminist (35). But this has certainly not
always been the case, and in order to understand the hegemony that
lesbian feminism has had over constructions of lesbian identity, Stein
reviews the basic assumptions of lesbian feminism as a political
philosophy. [Early lesbian feminism developed in an attempt to counter
the dominant medical construction of lesbianism as the congenital defect
of \"inversion.\" The medical model clearly suggested that lesbianism
was a biological trait]{.underline}, albeit a defective one, and early
homosexual rights advocates used this evidence to claim that lesbians
should be pitied for their condition rather than oppressed because of it
(37). With the rise of the women\'s movement in the seventies came an
increasing dissatisfaction with the association of lesbianism with
biological \"abnormality,\" as early feminists began to analyze other
explanations for the existence of lesbians. [The theory that came to
dominate early lesbian feminism was that [lesbians were those who
resisted the regime of compulsory heterosexuality, that they]{.mark},
unlike heterosexual women, [refused to become part of the male
economy]{.mark} by choosing to identify only with other women; thus was
born the concept of the \"woman-identified woman.\"\[]{.underline}3\]
Lesbian feminist activists in the seventies claimed not only that
lesbianism had nothing to do with a medical, or biologically
\"essential\" condition, but that it was, in fact, a choice available to
all women, and a choice that any woman aware of the oppressive nature of
heteropatriarchy would make. While lesbian feminism at first sought to
\"liberate the \'lesbian\' in every woman\" (38), the movement soon
found itself faced with the dilemma of identity politics. In order to
gain political ground, lesbian feminists felt the need to fix lesbian
identity as somewhat stable and coherent, in order to classify lesbians
as a \"minority\" deserving of protection against discrimination, but
the boundaries of this identity were fairly narrow, and excluded those
whose experience of being lesbian didn\'t measure up to the feminist
\"ideal\" (45). The tension produced by this move, away from recognizing
lesbianism as a personal and political choice and towards a more
essentialist understanding of lesbian identity (ironically not too far
removed from the medical models), sowed the seeds for the demise of
lesbian feminism as a powerful political force in the eighties, although
it also opened up the possibility for more specifically lesbian
varieties of political analysis, such as those taken up by the
sex-radicals of the early eighties (48).\[4\] Towards the late eighties,
Stein observes, lesbian feminism and lesbian politics in general were
separate entities, often with contradictory assumptions and political
aims. While the lesbian feminist analysis of oppression assumed an
inherent link between sex and gender \-- arguing, in the words of
Suzanne Pharr, that \"homophobia is a weapon of sexism" \[5\] \-- other
kinds of lesbian analysis (some of which also insisted on being
considered feminist) argued for the \"relative autonomy of gender and
sexuality, sexism and heterosexism\" (50). This latter position more
closely resembles that taken by many queer (male) activists in the late
eighties and early nineties, with whom these lesbians would come to
identify as a way of marking their difference from \"traditional\"
lesbian feminism. \"[Queerness,\" for these gay men and lesbians, is
understood as \"a non-normative sexuality which transcends the binary
distinction homosexual/heterosexual to include all who feel
disenfranchised by dominant sexual norms\"]{.underline} (50). Stein\'s
primary critique of this newly emerging \"[[queer\"
theory]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [[fails to adequately
\"compensate for]{.mark} real, persistent [structural differences in
style, ideology, and access to resources among men and
women]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (50). In other words[, [it privileges
sexuality]{.underline}]{.mark}[, in both political analysis and cultural
expression, [over gender, and]{.mark} thereby [threatens to erase or
reduce the gender-bound experience of lesbians]{.mark} as
women]{.underline}. While feminism may have failed to adequately address
the multiplicity of sexual difference in its analysis of the sex/gender
system, she argues, [[the new \"**queer theory\" fails to address gender
at all**]{.mark}**,** which makes it an arguably less effective
political philosophy for many lesbians.]{.underline} But a possible
benefit of the clash between lesbian feminism and queer theory is that
lesbian feminists have had to rethink their commitment to the belief in
the primacy of the sex/gender system over other forms of oppression, to
the extent that they have begun to theorize lesbianism as a provisional
identity \"situated in a web of multiple oppressions and identities
\"(51), taking into account differences of race, class, ethnicity in
ways that queer theory has so far failed to do. According to Stein,
then, this newer version of lesbian feminism, which has shifted away
from an exclusive focus on gender towards an understanding of multiple
oppressions, is a more \"decentered\" movement, which \"may present new
democratic potential\" (52). Not all lesbian-feminists have let queer
theory off the hook quite so easily, though. While Stein argues that a
newly \"redesigned\" lesbian feminism is more politically useful to
lesbians than queer theory, she does not critique the assumptions and
indeed arrogance of queer theory to the extent that other scholars have.
This is perhaps in part due to the most recent developments in queer
theory which Stein may not have been aware of in 1992; by 1994, however,
lesbian scholars have become acutely aware of the hegemony that queer
theory threatens to hold over all studies of gender and sexuality in the
academy, and have thus launched into full-scale critiques of its
totalizing tendencies. Perhaps the most scathing critique comes from
Sheila Jeffreys, whose work is not always received well by non lesbian
feminist scholars because of her tendency to claim to speak for all
lesbian feminists, when in fact she only speaks for a particularly
radical group. In her most recent article, \"The Queer Disappearance of
Lesbians: Sexuality in the Academy\" (1994), Jeffreys states simply,
\"[The appearance of [queer theory and queer studies threatens to mean
the disappearance of lesbians]{.mark}]{.underline}[\"]{.mark} (459).
Jeffreys\' concern, like that of so many lesbian feminists, is that
[queer theory threatens to offset the advances made by feminism by
failing altogether to recognize its impact in shaping contemporary
understanding of sexuality and gender; queer theory, she argues, is
\"feminism free]{.underline}\" (459). Despite its supposedly
counter-normative associations, Jeffreys [believes [the word \"queer\"
has come to signify white gay male]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [which renders
any project]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark} this signifier [simply
\"more of the same,\" while masquerading as \"new and uniquely
liberating]{.mark}]{.underline}[\"]{.mark} (469). Thus, unlike Stein,
whose critique of queer theory is relatively mild in comparison,
Jeffreys accuses this new theoretical discourse of deliberately
reinscribing the very oppression(s) [that feminists and lesbian
feminists have been fighting against for years, in order to privilege
(homo)sexuality and gay male culture as the epitome of the
\"anti-discourse\" made so much of by postmodern theory.]{.underline}
Central to Jeffreys\' critique is that [[queer theory privileges]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} indeed [naturalizes the masculine]{.mark} in a way that
runs [counter to the aims and goals of most forms of
feminism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The notion of \"camp\" or
\"drag]{.underline},\" which Jeffreys sees as one of the key concepts of
queer theory, [is built on gay male notions of performative femininity,
which not only excludes biological women but enshrines the dominant
construction of masculine as the binary opposite of
feminine;]{.underline} a drag queen\'s enactment of femininity for the
pleasure of other men, rather than calling into question the
performative nature of all gender roles, instead fixes perceived sexual
difference at the core of desire, a claim early lesbian feminists were
most anxious to refute. According to Jeffreys, then, [while queer theory
may claim to expand the limits of gender by \"playing\" with the terms
that constitute it \-- by supposedly separating femininity from the
female body in the persona of a drag queen,]{.underline} for example \--
[it in fact fails to account for the sexism inherent in the terms as
they are constituted by the dominant culture.]{.underline} A man
\"playing at\" being a coy, submissive woman, for the benefit of other
men, is hardly a vision of sophisticated gender analysis to most lesbian
feminists \-- which is not to criticize drag queens in and of
themselves, so much as to point out the inadequacy of drag as core
theoretical concept. [Jeffreys also criticizes the tendency of queer
politics to \"\[accept\] and \[celebrate\] the minority status of
homosexuality.\"]{.underline} [This]{.underline}, she believes, [is a
politics \"which is in contradiction to lesbian feminism]{.underline}\"
(469) [because of its insistence on a stable, coherent albeit
counter-normative identity.]{.underline} She continues: Lesbian
feminists do not see themselves as being part of a transhistorical
minority of 1 in 10 or 1 in 20, but as the model of free womanhood.
Rather than wanting acceptance as a minority which is defined in
opposition to an accepted and inevitable heterosexual majority, lesbian
feminist theorists seek to dismantle heterosexuality, and one strategy
is the promotion of lesbianism as a choice for women. (469)

#### Queer theory assumes a male identity---turns the movement

In the Academy," Women's Studies International Forum, 1994, JSTOR,

[The appearance of queer theory and queer studies threatens to mean the
disappearance of lesbians. The developing field of lesbian and gay
studies is dominated now by the queer impulse]{.underline}. Lesbian
feminism is conspicuous by its absence. [Lesbian feminism starts from
the understanding that the interests of lesbians and gay men are in many
respects very differen]{.underline}t because [lesbians are members of
the political class of women. [Lesbian liberation
requires]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to this analysis, [the
[destruction of men\'s power over women]{.mark}.]{.underline} In queer
theory and queer studies, [lesbians seem to appear only where they can
assimilate seamlessly into gay male culture and politics. No difference
is generally recognised in interests]{.underline}, culture, history
between lesbians and gay men. [[The new field of the study of
\'sexuality\' seems]{.mark} similarly [to be dominated by gay male
sexual politics and interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both areas are
remarkably free of feminist influence. As I discuss here, [there is
seldom any mention in queer theorising of sexuality of issues which are
of concern to feminists and lesbian feminists,]{.underline} such as
sexual violence and pornography or any politics of sexual desire or
practice, and there is no recognition of the specificity of lesbian
experience. [Within traditional Women\'s Studies, lesbian students and
teachers have long been angry at the \'lesbian-free\' nature of courses
and textbooks]{.underline}. A good example is Rosemarie Tong\'s Women\'s
Studies reader Feminist Thought (1989). Although many of the feminist
theorists covered in the book are lesbians, lesbian feminism is not one
of the varieties of feminist thought included here. The index directs
the reader to find lesbian feminist thought in three pages under the
heading of \'Radical feminism and sexuality\' (Tong, 1989). [[Lesbians
might well have expected to find the new lesbian and gay studies more
sympathetic to their interest]{.mark}s, [but that is only true in
practice if they see themselves as a variety of gay men rather than as
women.]{.mark} The new lesbian and gay studies is \'feminismfree.\' By
not recognising the different interests, history, culture, experience of
lesbians, lesbian and gay studies homogenises the interests of women
into those of men]{.underline}. It was precisely this disappearance of
women\'s interests and experience in the malestream academic world which
caused the development of Women\'s Studies in the first place. It cannot
therefore be an unalloyed cause for celebration in the 1990s that
lesbian and gay studies are becoming sufficiently well recognised to
have a whole new journal GLQ and a first reader, The Lesbian and Gay
Studies Reader (Abelove, Barale, & Halperin, 1993). Both are American in
origin and content. Even a casual glance at these publications suggests
that lesbians and feminists have considerable cause for concern. It is
not simply an abstract desire to right the injustice of lesbian
disappearance which motivates my concern at the way that lesbian and gay
studies are going. [The work of this new field does and will
increasingly influence the ideas and practices of lesbian and gay
culture]{.underline}. Academia is not hermetically sealed but reflects
and influences the world outside the academy. [[The disappearance of
lesbians into an economically powerful commercial gay culture]{.mark} in
the streets and the clubs [will be exacerbated by what is happening in
queer theory]{.mark}.]{.underline} The editorial of the first issue of
GLQ celebrates its commitment to \'queer\' politics. [The queer
perspective is not a gender-neutral one. [Many lesbians]{.mark}, perhaps
the vast majority of lesbian feminists, [feel nothing but hostility
toward and alienation from the word queer and see queer politics as very
specifically masculine.]{.mark}]{.underline} The editorial tells us that
the journal will approach all topics through a queer lens. \"We seek to
publish a journal that will bring a queer perspective to bear on any and
all topics touching on sex and sexuality\" (Dinshaw & Halperin, GLQ,
1993; p. iii). [We are told that the Q in the title of the journal GLQ
has two meanings, quarterly and also \"the fractious, the disruptive,
the irritable, the impatient, the unapologetic, the bitchy, the camp,
the queer\"]{.underline} (p. iii). [This definition of the word
\'queer\' should alert readers to its masculine bias.]{.underline} The
adjectives accompanying it here refer to male gay culture. [[They arise
from traditional notions of what is camp.]{.mark} Camp]{.underline}, as
we shall see[, lies at the very foundation of queer theory and politics
and is inimical to women\'s and lesbian interests]{.underline}. But
before looking at the problems with camp in detail, it is worth
considering another way in which this list of adjectives might not sit
well with lesbian feminism. [Although gay men\'s rebellion against
oppression might well have been so mild that it could be expressed in
terms like irritability, this has not been the way that lesbians have
traditionally phrased their rebellion]{.underline}. Perhaps because
lesbians have a great deal more to fight, that is, the whole system of
male supremacy, rage has been a more prevalent emotion than
irritability. The early womanifesto of lesbian feminism, the Woman-
Identified-Woman paper, expressed it thus: \"A Lesbian is the rage of
all women condensed to the point of explosion\" (Radicalesbians, 1988,
p. 17). [Irritable is how one might feel about not having garbage
collected, not about ending the rape, murder, and torture of women,
including lesbians. Some queer studies writers are currently seeking to
establish that \'camp\' is a fundamental part of \'queer.]{.underline}\'
There is still a controversy about what constitutes camp, with gay male
critics opposing their own notions to that expressed in the famous Susan
Sontag piece and pointing out that her version is heterosexist (Miller,
1993; Sontag, 1986). Sontag saw camp as a sensibility and one that was
not necessarily queer or gay. Moe Meyer, in the volume the POLITICS and
POETICS of CAMP, which is said on the blurb inside the cover to contain
essays by \"some of the foremost critics working in queer theory\" says
that [camp is \"solely a queer discourse\" and certainly not just a
\"sensibility\" but \"a suppressed and denied oppositional critique
embodied in the signifying practices that processually constitute queer
identities\"]{.underline} (Meyer, 1994b; p. 1). Rather, the function of
camp is the \"production of queer social visibility\" and the \"total
body of performative practices and strategies used to enact a queer
identity\" (Meyer, 1994b; p. 5). So [camp is defined here not just as
one aspect of what it is to be queer, but as absolutely fundamental to
queer identity. Camp appears]{.underline}, on examination, [to be based
largely on a male gay notion of the feminine.]{.underline} As his
example of camp political tactics, Meyer uses the Black drag queen, Joan
Jett Blakk, who ran as a mayoral candidate in Chicago in 1991. This man
ran as a \'Queer Nation\' candidate. He is referred to by female
pronouns throughout this piece, which raises some difficulties in itself
for women who wish to recognize themselves in the text. Meyer tells us
that [there were some objections from what he calls \"assimilationist
gays\" who saw the drag queen political tactic as \"flippant and
demeaning.\" The implication is that men who objected did so for
conservative motives, whereas in fact they might have been expressing
profeminist sympathies. For women and lesbians who have rejected
femininity, the celebration of it by a gay man is likely to be seen as
insulting rather than as something with which to identify in \'queer\'
solidarity]{.underline}. Actually, women might well want more women in
parliament rather than men wearing the clothing that has been culturally
assigned to women.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Materiality

**Queer theory fails**

AND INSTITUTIONS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDER PERSONS: A
QUEER/CRITICAL RACE FEMINIST CRITIQUE By LORI A. SAFFIN DOCTOR OF
PHILOSOPHY WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY Program of American Studies
AUGUST 2008

Despite the productive and effective strategies offered by Queer
Theorizing, [I am hesitant to firmly adhere]{.underline} only to this
body of knowledge. Many academics and activists alike have challenged
the political efficacy of queer theory, pointing out that [[the
pluralizing of identit]{.underline}y]{.mark}, though important,
[[continues to denigrate the importance of race, class, and
gender]{.underline}]{.mark}, as sexuality becomes the signifying element
of identification. Likewise, [I have concerns about the open ended
politics proclaimed under Queer Theory]{.underline}. As John D\'Emilio
illustrates in 12 his account of American gay and lesbian politics,
\"identity\" and \"difference\" have simultaneously served as the crux
as well as the crisis for most gay and lesbian organizing.13 So, [[if
\"queer\" is fluid, boundariless, oppositional]{.mark}, and
multiplicitous, [how do \"we\" organize around \"difference\" or ground
in politics]{.mark}]{.underline}? [What are these politics, and who sets
the agenda? [Queer Theory seeks \^definition in order to combat]{.mark}
the inherent [divisiveness created within identity politics]{.mark} and
disrupt rigidly constructed binaries. [However, materiality]{.mark},
material reality, and the lived experiences of individuals/communities
residing in the margins and [overlaps of structural racism, classism,
sexism]{.mark}, and heterosexism [seem overlooked]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [[Queer Theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps, purports
alternative and liberatory strategies in theory, but
[[encounters]{.mark} many [difficulties when attempting]{.mark}
coalitional [politics and]{.mark} everyday
[activism]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Queer theory [fails]{.underline} --- it provides [no solution]{.underline} to improve [real living conditions]{.underline} for LGBTQ individuals

[[Queerness as a deviant form of heterosexuality results in
**oppression**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [When this fact is not
confronted, it can lead to maladaptive responses that include the
markings of internalized homophobia]{.underline}: depression, psychosis,
resignation, and apathy. These are very much reactions to the ways in
which we view ourselves, which in turn are, at least in part, due to the
ways in which we are constantly told to view ourselves. Here, the
production of consciousness takes a very concrete form. [[Those
enduring]{.mark} this form of [violence **cannot**]{.mark}, even in the
academy, [simply **decide to disengage**. We cannot **simply refuse** to
acknowledge these facts of social life in our present society, and
**hope** that our circumstances will change]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Although the lack of definition is what has inspired the use of
\"queer,\" it cannot, as Butler herself asserts, \"overcome its
constituent history of injury\" (1993b: 223). Be that as it may,
\"queer,\" as put forward by Queer theorists, has no inherent historical
or social context. We continually return to the following question: to
whom does it belong and what does it represent? These advocates of
\"queer\" do not acknowledge that *queer* is produced by social
relations, and therefore contains the attributes of existing social
relations. As I have shown, [[Queer theory]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly as it is expressed in Butler\'s writings on performativity,
[[dichotomizes the political as personal and]{.mark} the political as
[social action into a **binary** that positions political action in
**impossible terms**.]{.mark} The nature of the \"political\" is never
clearly discussed, and remains a chasm]{.underline} (cf. Kaufman and
Martin, 1994). [However appealing the notion of positioning the self
through a reinterpretation of the \"I\" may be,]{.underline} it is
misguided as political action: [it [**cannot generate** the **collective
energy** and **organization** necessary to **challenge existing
structures of power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Michael Aglietta
observes, \"[There is **no magical road** where the most abstract
concepts magically command the movement of society]{.underline}\" (1979:
43). The question of polities, then, brings us back to where we began:
what is the nature of the political and how do we address it? Is it
beneficial to maintain alliances with established political parties? Can
we adopt the dominant values of our culture and still hope to change the
dynamics of those values? How do we form alliances with other oppressed
groups? Is there a structural economic basis for such an alliance, or
should we look elsewhere? Perhaps most importantly: is it possible,
given the tremendous resources represented by the dominant and coercive
ideology of our present social relations, to maintain the energy
necessary to develop and continue modes of resistance that counter it?
In the last question, as I will show, lies an answer to the issue of
alliances and structural identification. But first, we need to refocus
the discussion.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Futurism Bad

#### The promise of better future begs the question of whether future will ever arrive. This future is underwritten by black, brown, and queer death. The only starting point is a refusal of the future that demands the endless accumulation of these deaths. This turns the case which invests in futurity. 

Dillon 13

\[Stephen Dillon, "'It's here, it's that time:' Race, queer futurity,
and the temporality of violence in *Born in Flames*. Women &
Performance, 2013, 38-51. At 44-6. MYY\]

Throughout Born in Flames, countless members of theWomen's Army declare:
"This is our time." The time of the revolution was not the time to
abolish anti-blackness, white supremacy, and heteropatriarchy. It was a
time that left behind and captured poor (queer) women of color through
the progress of democracy and equality[. In this way, "[our time" and
state time are two antagonistic temporalities]{.mark} [of
violence]{.mark} in the film. As James Scott argues, [the modern state's
utopian aim is to reduce the disorderly and chaotic social order]{.mark}
under its purview [into a mirror of the administrative knowledge central
to its]{.mark} observations and [governance]{.mark}. **[The state works
to produce temporal and spatial intelligibility with the goal of
manufacturing the orderly administration and regulation of the nation's
population]{.mark}**, resources, and infrastructure. [By disrupting and
dismantling]{.mark} spaces[, populations]{.mark}, and 0epistemologies
that are [illegible to]{.mark} its [regimes of knowing]{.mark} and
governance, [the modern state creates a utopia of]{.mark} visibility and
[legibility]{.mark} that is open [to polici]{.mark}ng [and
control]{.mark} (Scott 1998, 82). The [management of time is
central]{.mark} to this process.]{.underline} "Our time" is what the
state seeks to capture. In Born in Flames, state time extends and
expands the violence of the past, while "our time" is a temporal regime
that exceeds and undoes state time. Again, Fanon proves useful for
understanding these differences. In The Wretched of the Earth, Fanon
describes [a "time lag, or a difference of rhythm, between the leaders
of a nationalist party and the mass of the people"]{.underline} (Fanon
1963, 107). According to Fanon, [the rank and file of anti-colonial
rebellions demand the complete and utter immediate destruction of the
forms of power that render them "more dead than alive," while both
colonial and nationalist governments attempt to manage, temper, and
restrain the demands of those who have no more time to give to the
promises of a future that is always coming, but never
arrives]{.underline} (51). For example, in the film, the state promises
that "in the future" there will be jobs, an end to sexual violence, and
racial and gender equality. But for Fanon, the "hopeless dregs of
humanity" (or the wretched of the earth) are filled with an
"uncontrollable rage" and thus exist in a temporal regime apart from
that of the party or the nation. This is a time of intensity and
immediacy ("the slaves of modern times are impatient"), where the future
of the present as it is means no future at all (74). Like the financial,
epistemological, and racialized legacies of slavery Baucom sees
intensifying in our current moment, [Fanon diagnoses [the future of
colonialism as the accumulation of]{.mark} the social, biological, and
living [death of the native]{.mark}. The native lives a death in life
produced by the racism of slavery and colonialism]{.underline}. **[[The
future's horizon is the accumulation of past forms of racial terror and
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this way, Baucom and Fanon draw
[[connections between race and time]{.mark} that [are crucial to
questions of queer futurity]{.mark}. The relationship between race,
gender, death, and the future is central to the immediacy and
spontaneity of the Women's Army and is foundational to the film's
critique of the future]{.underline}. We can turn to the
Fanonian-inspired prison writings of George Jackson to further explore
the relationship between death, race, and the future. In his 1972 text
Blood in My Eye, published shortly after he was shot and killed by
guards at San Quentin prison, Jackson writes of racism, death, and
revolution: Their line is: "Ain't nobody but black folks gonna die in
the revolution." This argument completely overlooks the fact that we
have always done most of the dying, and still do: dying at the stake,
through social neglect or in U.S. foreign wars. The point is now to
construct a situation where someone else will join in the dying. If it
fails and we have to do most of the dying anyway, we're certainly no
worse off than before. (Jackson 1972, 6) Here, Jackson argues that [the
social order of the United States is saturated with an anti-blackness
that produces]{.underline}, in the words of RuthWilson Gilmore, "**[the
state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of
group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death]{.underline}**"
(2007, 28). Jackson's text is littered with a polemic that links race
and death in a way that preemptively echoes Michel Foucault's
declaration that [racism is the process of "introducing a break into the
domain of life that is under power's control: the break between what
must live and what must die"]{.underline} (Foucault 2003, 254). When
Jackson, Gilmore, and Foucault define race as the production of
premature death, they make a connection between race and the future.
[[Race is the accumulation of premature death and
dying]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Jackson, race fractures the future so
that the future looks like incarceration or the premature death of
malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion. The future was not the
hopefulness of unknown possibilities. It was rather the devastating
weight of knowing that death was coming cloaked in abandonment, neglect,
incarceration, or murder. In other words, according to Jackson, death
was always and already rushing towards the present of blackness. In the
last line of No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive, Lee [Edelman
similarly connects the future to premature death when he references the
murder of Matthew Shepard. He writes: "Somewhere, someone else will be
savagely beaten and left to die -- sacrificed to a future whose beat
goes on, like a pulse or a heart -- and another corpse will be left like
a mangled scarecrow to frighten the birds who are gathering now, who are
beating their wings, and who, like the death drive, keep on
coming"]{.underline} (Edelman 2004, 154). For Edelman, [[the future
will]{.mark} necessarily continue to [produce a world]{.mark} that is
[unlivable for queer people]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this way, the
polemics of black liberation and Edelman's anti-social thesis share an
affinity around the theorization of the future as overdetermined by
premature death, yet they diverge in how they imagine death's
relationship to race and power. For Edelman, the future looks like
repetition of the death of Matthew Shepard (a white gay man), while for
Jackson, it looks like the premature death of incarceration, the ghetto,
and chattel slavery's haunting contortion of the present. In other
words, the state and anti-blackness were central to the anti-sociality
of the black liberation movement. Within Jackson's analysis, the state
is the primary mechanism for unevenly distributing racialized regimes of
value and disposability. Following the writing of Fanon, Jackson argued
that for this relationship to be abolished: "The government of the U.S.A
and all that it stands for, all that it represents, must be destroyed.
This is the starting point, and the end" (Jackson 1972, 54). Jackson's
polemic crescendos when he describes the future he desires: We must
accept the eventuality of bringing the U.S.A to its knees; accept the
closing off of critical sections of the city with barbed wire, armed pig
carriers criss-crossing the city streets, soldiers everywhere, tommy
guns pointed at stomach level, smoke curling black against the daylight
sky, the smell of cordite, house-to-house searches, doors being kicked
down, the commonness of death. (Jackson 1972, 55) **[[If the past and
present have produced the accumulation of the premature death]{.mark} of
black people, [then]{.mark} Jackson imagines the complete undoing of the
social order as the way out of temporal capture]{.underline}**. [[The
future of the social order means no future,]{.mark} and so [the future
must]{.mark} come to an [end]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Fanon similarly
imagines the relationship between the native and the future of the
social order: "They won't be reformed characters to please colonial
society, fitting in with the morality of its rulers; quite on the
contrary, they take for granted the impossibility of their entering the
city save by hand grenades and revolvers]{.underline}" (Fanon 1963,
130). [Here, [the invitation to the safety and security of the]{.mark}
city (or the [social order as it is]{.mark}) [is an offer to continue a
life that is a half-life. Possibility comes from a starting point that
is an end]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 1NC \-- Turn \-- Politics Good

#### Their theory of the political is incorrect -- politics is a site of reform -- that's why people vote, care about the environment and live in communities -- there is value in tangible improvements in the human condition

**Brenkman 2** (John, Distinguished Professor of English and Comprative
Literature at CUNY Graduate Center, Narrative, "Queer Post-Politics",
Volume 10, Issue 2, p. 174-180, Project Muse)

But Edelman interprets this nonrecognition in very different terms from
those I have just used. When he asserts that \"there are no queers in
that future as there can be no future for queers,\" he is not making a
mere statement of protest; rather, he is announcing the theoretical
position that is the explicit stake of his entire argument. I \[End Page
175\] now want to turn to his theoretical project, which involves an
argument in political theory and an argument from psychoanalysis and a
link between the two. The Political Theory Argument For Edelman the
image of the child-as-future is more than a powerful trope in the
political discourse of the moment. It in effect defines the political
realm: \"For politics, however radical the means by which some of its
practitioners seek to effect a more desirable social order, is
conservative insofar as it necessarily works to affirm a social order,
defining various strategies aimed at actualizing social reality and
transmitting it into the future it aims to bequeath to its inner child\"
(19). The burden of this argument is that a genuinely critical discourse
cannot arise via the marking or symbolizing of the gap between the
present and the future. Such symbolizing has indeed been the defining
feature of modern critical social discourse, whether among the
Enlightenment\'s philosophes, French revolutionaries, Marxists, social
democrats, or contemporary socialists and democrats. Jürgen Habermas, in
The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, defines modern
time-consciousness itself as a taking of responsibility for the future.
Edelman sees in such a time-consciousness an inescapable trap. [For him
any]{.underline} such [political]{.underline} discourse or [activity
steps into \"the logic by which political engagement serves always as
the medium for reproducing our social reality\"]{.underline} (26).
Certainly the political realm---whether viewed from the perspective of
the state, the political community and citizenship, or political
movements---is a medium of social reproduction, in the sense that it
serves the relative continuity of innumerable economic and non-economic
institutions. **[But it is not simply a mechanism of social
reproduction; it is also the site and instrument of social
change.]{.underline}** Nor is it simply the field of existing power
relations; it is also the terrain of contestation and compromise.
[Edelman]{.underline} compounds his reductive concept of the political
realm by in turn postulating an ironclad intermeshing of social
reproduction and sexual reproduction. Here too he [takes a fundamental
feature of modern society, or any society, and **absolutizes it.**
Sexual reproduction is a necessary dimension of social
reproduction]{.underline}, almost by definition, [in the sense that a
society\'s survival depends upon]{.underline}, among many other things,
the fact [that its members reproduce.]{.underline} Kinship practices,
customs, religious authorities, and civil and criminal law variously
regulate sexual reproduction. [However, that is **not to say** that the
imperatives of social reproduction **dictate** or **determine** or fully
functionalize the institutions and practices of sexual
reproduction]{.underline}. **[The failure to recognize the relative
autonomy of those institutions and practices underestimates how
seriously]{.underline}** feminism and **[the gay and lesbian movement
have already challenged]{.underline}** the norms and institutions of
compulsory **[heterosexuality]{.underline}** in our society. They have
done so **[through creative transformations in civil society and
everyday life and through cultural initiatives and political and legal
reforms.]{.underline}** The anti-abortion and anti-gay activism of the
Christian Right arose, in response, to alter and reverse the fundamental
achievements of these movements. How then to analyze or theorize this
struggle? A motif in Edelman\'s analysis \[End Page 176\] takes the
rhetoric and imagery of the Christian Right and traditional Catholicism
to be a more insightful discourse than liberalism when it comes to
understanding the underlying politics of sexuality today. I think this
is extremely misguided[. The Right does not have a truer sense of the
social-symbolic order than liberals and radicals; it simply has more
reactionary aims]{.underline} and has mobilized with significant effect
to impose its phobic and repressive values on civil society and through
the state. The Christian Right is itself a \"new social movement\" that
contests the feminist and gay and lesbian social movements. [To grant
the Right the status of exemplary articulators of \"the\" social order
strikes me as **politically self-destructive** and **theoretically just
plain wrong.**]{.underline}

#### Democratic politics can transform social relations without reaffirming homophobia -- the affirmative conflates contingent flaws with structural antagonisms.

School, "Politics, Mortal and Natal: An Arendtian Rejoinder," Narrative

p. 187-8,

In my view, [Edelman effaces this difference between democracy and
totalitarianism]{.underline}. He attributes to democracy the workings of
totalitarianism: [he makes no distinction between civil society and the
state, equates \"the social order\" with politics as such, and equates
both with the symbolic order. This misconception]{.underline} of
democratic politics [is what anchors his call for \"a true oppositional
politics]{.underline}\" whose meaning-dissolving, identity-dissolving
ironies would come from \"the space outside the frame within which
\'politics\' appears\" (\"Post-Partum\" 181). [The democratic state, as
opposed to the totalitarian, does not rule civil society but secures its
possibility and flourishing; conversely, civil society is the
nonpolitical realm from which emerge those initiatives that
transform]{.underline}, moderately or radically, [the
political]{.underline} realm of laws and rights. For that very reason,
the political frame of laws and rights, and of debate and decision, is
intrinsically inadequate to the plurality of projects and the social
divisions within society---[there is always a gap]{.underline} in its
political representation of the \"real\" of the social---[and for that
very reason the political realm itself is **open to change and
innovation**]{.underline}. Innovation is a crucial concept for
understanding the gay and lesbian movement, which emerged from within
civil society as citizens who were stigmatized and often criminalized
for their sexual lives created new forms of association, transformed
their own lifeworld, and organized a political offensive on behalf of
political and social reforms. There was an innovation of rights and
freedoms, and what I have called innovations in sociality. Contrary to
the liberal interpretation of liberal rights and freedoms, I do not
think that gays and lesbians have merely sought their place at the
table. Their struggle has radically altered the scope and meaning of the
liberal rights and freedoms they sought, first and foremost by making
them include sexuality, sexual practices, and the shape of household and
family. Where the movement has succeeded in changing the laws of the
state, it has also opened up new possibilities within civil society. To
take an obvious example, [wherever it becomes unlawful to deny housing
to individuals because they are gay, there is set in motion a
transformation]{.underline} of the everyday life of neighborhoods,
including the lives of heterosexuals and their children. Within civil
society, this is a work of enlightenment, however uneven and fraught and
frequently dangerous. [It is **not** a reaffirmation of the symbolic and
structural underpinnings of homophobia; on the contrary, it is a
challenge to homophobia and a volatilizing of social
relations]{.underline} within the nonpolitical realm.

#### The 1AC's reductive conceptualization of the political homogenizes queer subjectivity \-- locks in oppression and makes change impossible

**Power 9** (Nina, Professor at Roehampton University, "Non-Reproductive
Futurism" p. 5-6
<http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol8no2_2009/power_futurism.pdf>)

**[The supposed futural 'reason' of]{.underline}** representative
**[politics is in effect profoundly fractured and
contradictory,]{.underline}** not in the least bit reconciled to either
its image of the child, or to its image of itself. **[Edelman's notion
of the queer]{.underline}** nevertheless **[seems to depend on an overly
homogenous picture of the social world. To write, as
Edelman]{.underline}** claims to, from 'the space outside the framework
within which politics as we know it appears and so outside the conflict
of visions that share as their presupposition that the body politic must
survive' (Edelman, 2004: 3) **[involves deliberately superimposing
various 'political' categories onto various non-political
categories]{.underline}**. Thus, **[Edelman conflates democracy with the
child, rationality with a naïve concept of progress and heterosexuality
with reproduction, sweeping away the possibility of collective
organisation and action.]{.underline}** As John Brenkman puts it:
'**[Edelman compounds his reductive concept of the political realm by in
turn postulating an ironclad intermeshing of social reproduction and
sexual reproduction']{.underline}** (Brenkman, 2002: 176). By neglecting
the contradictory economic imperatives at work in political conceptions
of the family and fusing politics with reason **[Edelman leaves no room
at all for what we could call a 'queer reason'-- queer from the
standpoint of representational politics, and neither committed to the
child nor to sexual essentialism]{.underline}**. It is here that
Rancière's ideas are relevant. **[If a 'queer reason' is to make any
sense, it is important to separate out two different kinds of
rationalism, which Edelman refuses to do]{.underline}**. In a section in
Disagreement entitled 'The Rationality of Disagreement,' Rancière states
the following: Political rationality is only thinkable precisely on the
condition that it be freed from the alternative in which a certain
rationalism would like to keep it reined in, either as exchange between
partners putting their interests or standards up for discussion, or else
the violence of the irrational (Rancière, 1999: 43).

I will, in the following description, focus on the situation in the
human sciences (rather than the hard sciences), where [the explosion of
publication creates an ever-expanding circle in which there is always
**too much to read**]{.underline}---[too many positions, too many
arguments, too much contradictory evidence]{.underline}---so that
scholars have to rely on either the author\'s stature or theoretical
and/or political agreement. [[It has become]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[**[impossible to read everything]{.mark}** one must read]{.underline},
everything necessary to legitimate, at least in traditional terms, the
claim of academic expertise or scholarship. In fact, given this
situation (and its consequences as I will describe below), the most
surprising thing is how much good work continues to be produced.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} situation [[has **serious
consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [First,]{.underline} one\'s
[expertise becomes defined in increasingly narrow terms, resulting in
[the proliferation of]{.mark} sub-fields.]{.underline}9 **\[insert
footnote 9\]** [For example, one might point to [security
studies]{.mark}, surveillance studies, [transition studies, game
studies]{.mark}, code studies, [hip-hop studies, horror studies,]{.mark}
etc.]{.underline} **\[Footnote 9 ends\]** And [[while each of them is
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark} for their interdisciplinary efforts around
a new empirical field, they all too often act as if the questions (and
the realities they interrogate) are new; unfortunately, [they rarely say
anything new or surprising]{.underline}, anything that has not been said
elsewhere. [They frequently simply re-discover in their own empirical
\"pocket\" universe what others have said previously in other
fields]{.underline}. For example, all sorts of technologically defined
sub-fields rediscover the rather old assumption that media audiences are
active. This is partly because, [within each subfield, one gets the
impression of witnessing endless redistributions of a highly
circumscribed set of citations and authors, under a series of
ever-changing terms to describe their]{.underline} fields or
[positions]{.underline}. So, [[academics create]{.underline}]{.mark}
ever shrinking circles in which authors cite a few theoretically and
politically compatible works, and then follow the footnotes, all of
which ultimately lead back to the original authors, creating **[[an
endlessly self-referential closed system of citations,]{.mark} a
numbingly predictable, circular tissue of references]{.underline}**.
[Second, one is less likely to read work that appears tangential but may
nevertheless be absolutely decisive to producing truly interesting and
insightful research]{.underline}. Asking significant questions should
demand that one makes reference to all sorts of concepts and questions
which would lead one to follow other unexpected traditions and lines of
research, since [[any investigation]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., around
questions of participation, publics, or leadership, to use only a few
examples that have irked me recently) [[is likely to open up to an
entire history of]{.mark} problematization, of conversations and
[debates, but]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[who can afford the time and
energy]{.mark} anymore]{.underline}**. [Third, one tends to read only
the most recent work since so much is being published]{.underline}---in
various media---[so rapidly that there is **little time to go back and
read**]{.underline}. [Fourth, one tends to select one\'s sources
according to criteria that have more to do with]{.underline} theoretical
and [political sympathies than with an understanding of research as **a
conversation with difference**]{.underline}. [One reads selectively,
finding those ideas that are already in line with what one assumes one
already knows]{.underline}, and one establishes a body of near-sacred
texts; fifth, one selects topics that are au courant, partly because
there is less scaffolding that one has to build upon and partly because
one\'s work is more likely to gain visibility and impact. Sixth,
**[[complexity goes out the door]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as one
increasingly \"sees the world in a grain of sand]{.underline}.\" One can
no longer be satisfied claiming to have discovered merely a new piece of
a complex puzzle or even an interesting redeployment of an older
practice or structure, because such claims do not bring fame and
glory---either to oneself or the university. Instead, one has to have
discovered the leading edge, the new key or essence. One good but
relatively small idea is expanded into a metonym for the entire economy,
culture or society. Instead of seeking new discursive forms to embody
complexity, uncertainty and humility, one goes with elegance, hyperbole
and the ever receding new.

"Extremist Politics: Debating the Nuts and Bolts."
<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/extremist-politics-debating-the-nuts-and-bolts_b_1914307>}//JM

Starting next week and through October, President Barack Obama and Gov.
Mitt Romney will face off in a series of four televised debates,
designed to clarify the candidates' positions on the most pressing
public policy issues confronting the nation today. In place of the
ideals and elegant rhetoric of the campaign trail, the leaders of the
two major parties will have an opportunity to describe the nitty-gritty
of governing: how they will deal with complex matters like affordable
health care, foreign policy in the Middle East, job creation, equitable
taxation, and more.

But [the unfortunate reality is that [Americans]{.mark} won't get much
in the way of detail and explanation]{.underline}. If history is any
guide, the [debate moderators will not press very hard for nuts and
bolts, instead]{.underline} allowing the candidates to evade and attack
and [talk in unhelpful generalities. They will [preach in pre-tested
catch phrases to the already converted rather than]{.mark} really
[explaining]{.mark} the difficult day-to-day realities of decision
making]{.underline} in a democracy.

Cynics will say that it doesn't matter, that voters' minds are made up
anyway. But if national debates aren't the venue for challenging
citizens' thinking, then what is? [Voters need to understand [the
prosaic details of complex policies]{.mark}. Most have staked out
positions on these issues, but they are not often reasoned positions,
which take hard intellectual work.]{.underline} Most citizens opt
instead for simplistic explanations, assuming wrongly that they
comprehend the nuances of issues.

[Psychological scientists have a name for this easy, automatic,
simplistic thinking: the illusion of explanatory depth. [We strongly
believe that we understand complex matters, when]{.mark} in fact [we are
clueless]{.mark}]{.underline}, and these false and extreme beliefs shape
our preferences, judgments, and actions --- including our votes.

[Is it possible [to shake]{.mark} such [deep-rooted
convictions]{.mark}?]{.underline} That's the question that Philip
Fernbach, [a psychological scientist at the University of Colorado's
Leeds School of Business,]{.underline} wanted to explore. Fernbach and
his colleagues wondered if [[forcing people to explain complex policies
in detail]{.mark} --- not cheerleading for a position but really
[considering the mechanics of implementation]{.mark} --- might [force
them to confront their ignorance]{.mark} and]{.underline} thus [weaken
their extremist stands on issues. They ran a series of lab experiments
to test this idea.]{.underline}

They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in their 30s ---
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents --- and asking them to state
their positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat tax to a
cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. They indicated how strongly
the felt about each issue and also rated their own understanding of the
issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to write elaborate
explanations of two issues. If the issue was cap and trade, for example,
they would first explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is
implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could hurt, the sources of
carbon emissions, and so forth. They were not asked for value judgments
about the policy or about the environment or business, but only for a
highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.

Let's be honest: [Most of us never do this]{.underline}. Fernbach's
[idea was that such an exercise would force many to realize just how
little they really know]{.underline} about cap and trade, and confronted
with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm. [They
would]{.underline} [be humbled and as a result take less extreme
positions]{.underline}. And that's just what happened.
[Trying]{.underline} --- and failing --- [to explain complex policies
undermined the extremists' illusions about being
well-informed]{.underline}. They became more moderate in their views as
a result.

[[Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts]{.mark} of a policy
[is]{.mark} not the same as trying to sell that policy]{.underline}. In
fact, talking about one's views can often strengthen them. Fernbach
believes [it's [the slow, cognitive work]{.mark} --- the [deliberate
analysis]{.mark} --- [that changes people's
judgments]{.mark},]{.underline} but he wanted to check this in another
experiment. This one was very similar to the first, but some volunteers,
instead of explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it.
Consider universal health care, for example: It's highly complex and
challenging to explain, but much easier to label it "compassionate" or,
alternatively, "European" or "socialist." So some volunteers were
assigned to do the hard explaining and others the simplistic labeling.

The results were clear. As described in a forthcoming issue of the
journal Psychological Science, [[those who simply]{.mark} listed reasons
for their positions --- [articulating their values --- were less
shaken]{.mark} in their views]{.underline}. They continued to think they
understood the policies in their complexity, and, notably, they remained
extreme in their passion for their positions. In a final version of the
study, volunteers who were forced to confront their inadequate knowledge
actually gave less money to the cause, suggesting that with their
extremism attenuated, they actually acted more moderately.

[Americans in 2012 are about as polarized and partisan as they've ever
been, and such polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are
unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out information that
bolsters their views,]{.underline} often without knowing it. They also
process new information in biased ways, and they hang out with people
like themselves. All of these [psychological forces increase political
extremism, and no simple measure will change that. But]{.underline}
forcing the candidates to [provide concrete and elaborate plans might be
a start]{.underline}; it gives citizens a starting place. As former
presidential hopeful Ross Perot famously stated, "[The devil is in the
details."]{.underline}

These [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} or quasi-government think tank
[[simulations]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}
very similar [[lessons for]{.underline}]{.mark} high-level players as
are learned by [[students in educational
simulations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Government [[participants
learn]{.underline}]{.mark} about [the importance of understanding
[foreign perspectives]{.mark},]{.underline} the need to practice
internal coordination, [[and]{.mark} the necessity to
[compromise]{.mark}]{.underline} and coordinate with other governments
in negotiations and crises. During the Cold War, political scientist
Robert Mandel noted how [crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} and war
games [[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} government [[officials]{.mark} to
overcome ''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving [beyond their normal
organizational roles]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [thinking]{.mark} more
[creatively]{.mark} about how others might react in a crisis or
conflict]{.underline}.6 The [[skills of imagination
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the subsequent [ability to predict [foreign
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} and reactions [[remain critical for
real-world]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign [[policy]{.underline}
[makers]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, simulations of the Iranian
nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings Institution's
Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center, and involving
former US senior officials and regional experts\*highlighted the dangers
of misunderstanding foreign governments' preferences and misinterpreting
their subsequent behavior. In both simulations, the primary criticism of
the US negotiating team lay in a failure to predict accurately how other
states, both allies and adversaries, would behave in response to US
policy initiatives.7∂ [By university age, students]{.underline} often
[have a pre-defined view of international affairs]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the literature on [[simulation]{.underline}s]{.mark}
in education has long emphasized how such [exercises [force students to
challenge their assumptions]{.mark} about how other governments behave
and how their own government works]{.underline}.8 Since simulations
became more common as a teaching tool in the late 1950s[, educational
literature has expounded on their benefits, from encouraging engagement
by breaking from the typical lecture format, to improving communication
skills]{.underline}, to promoting teamwork.9 More broadly, [[simulations
can deepen]{.mark} [understanding]{.mark} [by asking students to link
fact and theory,]{.mark} providing a context for facts while bringing
theory into the realm of practice]{.underline}.10 These exercises are
particularly valuable in teaching international affairs for many of the
same reasons they are useful for policy makers: [[they force
participants to ''grapple with]{.mark} the [issues]{.mark} arising from
a world in flux.'']{.underline}11 [[Simulations]{.mark} [have]{.mark}
[been used]{.mark} successfully [to teach students]{.mark} about such
disparate topics as European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US
response to the mass killings in Darfur]{.underline}.12 Role-playing
exercises certainly encourage students to learn political and technical
facts\* but they learn them in a more active style. Rather than sitting
in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, students actively
research ''their'' government's positions and actively argue, brief, and
negotiate with others.13 Facts can change quickly; simulations teach
students how to contextualize and act on information.14

Policy simulations stimulate Creativity [[Participation in **policy
games**]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[proved to be a highly effective way
of developing]{.mark} new combinations of [experience and
creativity]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which is]{.underline}
]{.mark}[precisely [what innovation requires]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Geurts et al. 2007: 548). **[[Gaming]{.mark},]{.underline}** whether in
analog or digital mode, has the power to stimulate creativity, and
[[is]{.mark}]{.underline} one of the most engaging and
[[liberating]{.underline}]{.mark} ways for making group work productive,
challenging and enjoyable. Geurts et al. (2007) cite one instance where,
in a National Health Care policy change environment, 'the many
[[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} involved [**[accepted the]{.mark}**
invitation to participate]{.underline} in what was a [[**revolutionary**
and **politically very sensitive experiment**]{.underline} **[precisely
because it was a game']{.underline}**]{.mark} (Geurts et al. 2007: 547).
[Data from other policy simulations also indicate the uncovering of
issues of which participants were not aware]{.underline}, the emergence
of new ideas not anticipated, [and a perception that [policy simulations
are also an enjoyable way to formulate
strateg]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark} (Geurts et al. 2007). [Gaming
puts the players in an 'experiential learning' situation,]{.underline}
where they discover a concrete, realistic and complex initial situation,
and the gaming process of going through multiple learning cycles helps
them work through the situation as it unfolds. [[Policy gaming
stimulates 'learning how to learn']{.mark}, as in a game, and learning
by doing alternates with reflection and discussion]{.underline}. [The
[progression through learning cycles can]{.mark} also [be **much
faster** than in real-life]{.mark}]{.underline} (Geurts et al. 2007:
548). The bottom line is that problem solving in policy development
processes requires creative experimentation. This cannot be primarily
taught via 'camp-fire' story telling learning mode but demands hands-on
'veld learning' that allow for safe creative and productive
experimentation. [This is exactly what good policy simulations
provide]{.underline} (De Geus, 1997; Ringland, 2006). In simulations
**[[participants cannot view issues solely from either their own
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[or that of one dominant
stakeholder]{.underline}]{.mark} (Geurts et al. 2007). Policy

historically people seek and enjoy the tension of competition, positive
rivalry and the procedural justice of impartiality in safe and regulated
environments. [As in games, simulations temporarily remove the
participants from their daily routines, political pressures, and the
restrictions of real-life protocols.]{.underline} In consensus building,
**[[participants engage in extensive debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
need to act on a shared set of meanings and beliefs [[to guide the

#### The AFF's conception of "queerness as transgression" presumes a foundational whiteness which privileges fluidity, ability, and mobility at the expense of racialized peoples. This upholds an individualist liberal humanism complicit with capitalism and American exceptionalism.

Times*, 2007, p. 21-24\]

Some may strenuously object to the suggestion that [[queer
identities]{.underline}]{.mark}, like their \"less radical\"
counterparts, homosexual, gay, and lesbian identities,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[implicated in]{.mark} ascendant white
[American nationalist formations]{.mark}, preferring to see queerness as
singularly transgressive]{.underline} of identity norms. [This [focus on
transgression]{.mark}]{.underline}, however [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
precisely [[the term by which queerness narrates its own sexual
exceptionalism]{.underline}.]{.mark} While we can point to the obvious
problems with the emancipatory, missionary pulses of certain (U.S.,
western) feminisms and of gay and lesbian liberation, queerness has its
own exceptionalist desires: **[exceptionalism is a founding impulse,
indeed the very core of a queerness that claims itself as an anti-,
trans-, or unidentity]{.underline}**. The paradigm or gay liberation and
emancipation has produced all sorts of troubling narratives: about the
greater homophobia of immigrant communities and communities of color,
about the stricter family values and mores in these communities, about a
certain prerequisite migration from home, about coming-out teleologies.
We have less understanding of [[queerness]{.mark} as a biopolitical
project]{.underline}, one that both [[parallels]{.mark} and intersects
[with]{.mark} that of [multiculturalism]{.mark}, the ascendancy of
whiteness, and may collude with or collapse into liberationist
paradigms]{.underline}. While [liberal underpinnings]{.underline} serve
to constantly recenter the normative gay or lesbian subject as
exclusively liberatory, these same tendencies [[labor to insistently
recenter the normative queer subject as an exclusively transgressive
one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Queerness here is the modality through which
[\"freedom from norms\" becomes a regulatory queer ideal that demarcates
the ideal queer]{.underline}. Arguing that \"more reflection on queer
attachments might allow us to avoid positing assimilation or
transgression as choices,\" Sara Ahmed notes, \"[[The idealization of
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, or transformation of movement into a
fetish, [[depends on the exclusion of others who are already positioned
as not free in the same way]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"55 [Individual
freedom becomes the barometer of choice in the valuation,
and]{.underline} ultimately, [regulation]{.underline}, [of
queerness]{.underline}. Ahmed\'s post-Marxian frame focuses on the
material, cultural, and social capital and resources that might delimit
\"access\" to queerness, suggesting that queerness can be an elite
cosmopolitan formulation contingent upon various regimes of mobility.
Ironically, [\"[those that have access\" to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}such [[cultural capital and material resources may constitute
the very same populations that many would accuse of assimilation, living
out queerness in the most apolitical or conservatively political
ways]{.underline}.]{.mark} I am thinking of [queerness as
exceptional]{.underline} in a way that [is wedded to individualism and
the rational, liberal humanist subject]{.underline}, what Ahmed denotes
as \"attachments\" and what I would qualify as deep psychic registers of
investment that we often cannot account for and are sometimes best seen
by others rather than ourselves. **[\"Freedom from norms\" resonates
with liberal humanism's authorization of the fully self-possessed
speaking subject, untethered by hegemony or false consciousness, enabled
by the life/stylization offerings of capitalism, rationally choosing
modern individualism over the ensnaring bonds of family]{.underline}**.
[In this problematic definition of queerness, individual agency is
legible only as resistance to norms rather than complicity with them,
thus equating resistance and agency]{.underline}. Both Saba Mahmood and
Ahmed critique this conflation and redirect their attention to agency
that supports and consolidates norms, but even this turn presupposes
some general universal understanding of what counts as norm, resistance,
and complicity. As Mahmood asks, \"\[Is it\] possible to identify a
universal category of acts---such as those of resistance---outside of
the ethical and political conditions within which such acts acquire
their particular meaning?\"56 [[The rhetoric of freedom
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also of course [[a mainstay in philosophies of
liberal democracy and is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[a foundational
tenet of American exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. But finally,
[[queerness as transgression]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is one step
ahead of resistance, which has now become a normative act) [[relies on a
normative notion of deviance, always defined in relation to normativity,
often universalizing.]{.mark} Thus deviance, despite its claims to
freedom and individuality, is ironically cohered to and by regulatory
regimes of queerness---through, not despite, any claims to
transgression]{.underline}. While Ahmed also looks to queerness as a
challenge predominantly to heteronorms, queer theorists such as Cathy
Cohen implicate queer politics in an intersectional model that should
also ideally challenge race and class norms as they intersect with
heteronorms.57 Other queer theorists might articulate queerness as a
poststructuralist endeavor that deconstructs not only heteronorms, but
the very logic of identity itself. In the first version of queerness,
[resistance to heteronorms may be privileged in a way that effaces the
effects of this resistance in relation to possible complicities with
other norms, such as racial, class, gender, and citizenship privileges.
Queer intersectional analyses challenge this regulatory queerness, but
in doing so]{.underline} may fail [to subject their own frames to the
very critique they deploy. In this]{.underline} second [formulation,
queer of color]{.underline} and queer immigrant
[communities]{.underline} (not to mention queer of color critique) [are
always beyond reproach, an untenable position given the]{.underline}
(class, religious, gender-queer, national, regional, linguistic,
generational) [tensions within, among, and between queer diasporic,
immigrant, and of color communities]{.underline}, thus [obfuscating any
of their own conservative proclivities]{.underline}. Conversely,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[holds queer of color organizing and
theorizing to impossible standards]{.underline}]{.mark} and
expectations, always [[beholden to spaces and actions of resistance,
transgression, subversion]{.underline}.]{.mark} In the last instance,
[all (of one\'s) identities]{.underline} (not just gender and sexual)
[must be constantly troubled, reading to an impossible transcendent
subject who is always]{.underline} already [conscious of the
normativizing forces of power and]{.underline} always [ready and able to
subvert, resist, or transgress them. [It is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}precisely [[by denying culpability or assuming that one is not
implicated in violent relations toward others]{.underline},]{.mark} that
one is outside of them, [[that violence can be perpetuated.
Violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially of the liberal varieties,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often most [[easily perpetrated
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[spaces and places where its possibility
is]{.underline}]{.mark} unequivocally [[denounced]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### The 1ACs approach to queerness as intrinsically subversive, counterhegemonic, and individuated cleaves the ontological from the political generating a settler neutrality that colludes with settler homo-nationalism and turns the case. The desire to dismantle the notion of identity is a settler desire for the elimination of native people. 

**Rosenburg 14** (Jordana Rosenberg, Literature Professor at UMass
Amherst "The Molecularization of Sexuality: On Some Primitivisms of the
Present," *Theory & Event* Volume 17 Issue 2 GC)

[To the extent that queer studies has shifted focus from queer objects
to objects more generally, this shift has a double
resonance]{.underline}. On the one hand, [it represents the critical
force of diasporic and [queer of color critique to broaden the
understanding of sexuality]{.mark} to a set of conjunctural questions
[that contextualizes the ontological illusion of
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline} within what Roderick Ferguson
describes as the ineluctably political field of subject formation and
the production of desire: ["If the intersections of race, gender,
sexuality and class constitute social formations within liberal
capitalism, then queer of color analysis obtains its genealogy within a
variety of locations.]{.underline} We may say that women of color
feminism names a crucial component of that genealogy as woman of color
theorists have historically theorized intersections as the basis of
social formations. Queer of color analysis extends women of color
feminism by investigating how intersecting racial, gender, and sexual
practices antagonize and/or conspire with the normative investments of
nation-state and capital."20

Queer of color critique insists that queerness cannot be understood in
isolation from a range of social formations. In doing so, Ferguson notes
that this composite of forces ("racial, gender, and sexual practices")
operates with a double valence: an "and/or" logic. It's this "and/or"
that has marked queer theory for the past decade or more. [Even as
queerness remains a site of resistance to]{.underline} what Elizabeth
Freeman has indispensably termed ["chrononormativity" -- or, what we
might understand as the demands of racial capitalism for certain forms
of productivity and submission to the status quo]{.underline} -- as
Jasbir Puar has made clear, queerness has also, in crucial ways, become
folded into chrononormativity. For Puar[, [the conspiring between queer
subjects and the nation-state is marked by the "incorporation of queers
into the domains of consumer markets and social recognition]{.mark} in
the post-civil rights late twentieth century ... \[as\] queers \[enter
into\] the biopolitical optimization of life," and become "tied to ideas
of life and productivity."]{.underline}21 In both accounts, however, we
notice the ways that [queer studies has expanded its focus from
explicitly "queer" objects to an intersectional or conjunctural account
of the social world.]{.underline}

In a special issue of Social Text, "What's Queer About Queer Studies
Now?," David Eng, J. Jack Halberstam, and Jose Munoz describe this
expansion as queer theory's "subjectless turn": "[What might be called
the '[subjectless' critique of queer studies disallows any positing of
a]{.mark} proper [subject]{.mark} of [or object for the field by
insisting that queer has no fixed political referent]{.mark} ... A
subjectless critique establishes ... a [focus on a 'wide field of
normalization' as the site of social violence]{.mark}]{.underline}."22
It should be said that this subjectless critique is, itself, marked by a
kind of and/or logic. As Andrea Smith has argued, while the subjectless
turn [opens up queer work beyond the kind of "ethnographic
multiculturalism" that attends the neoliberal Humanities more generally,
there is also [a tendency for this turn to ontologize queerness
itself]{.mark}]{.underline} such that the fundamental plays of power
that [constitute that social world become normalized and
de-specified.]{.underline} Drawing on Puar, Smith argues that [the
["subjectless" subject]{.mark} of queer critique often [unwittingly puts
into place a racialized subject that bears the burden of
subjectivity]{.mark}: "Puar's analysis of biopower suggests that modern
white queer subjects can live only if racialized subjects trapped in
primitive and unenlightened cultures pass away"]{.underline} (49).

Smith's focus here has to do with [[explicating the relationship between
settler colonialism and queerness -- tracing how this relation comes to
be encoded at the level of the body,]{.mark} of [desire,]{.mark} and in
the habitus of the everyd]{.underline}ay. More than this -- and more to
the point for our work here -- Smith elucidates how [origin narratives
embed themselves at the heart of not only queer subject formation, but
queer theory as well. Building on her claims regarding the subjectless
turn,]{.underline} and citing Elizabeth Povinelli, Smith argues that:
["**[queer politics and consciousness often rely on a primitivist notion
of the indigenous as the space of free and unfettered sexuality that
allows the white queer citizen to remake]{.mark}** his or her \[their\]
[sexuality]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, once [[**this sexual praxis is
engaged, it does not translate into solidarity with indigenous peoples'
land struggles. The subjectless critique thus calls attention to both
the importance of Native peoples within scholarly work and their
disappearance within this work**.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the same time,
it may be the case that [it is in fact a [subjectless critique that
disguises the fact that the queer, postcolonial, or environmentally
conscious subject is simultaneously a settler
subject"]{.mark}]{.underline} (52).

To reiterate: [the despecification of the queer object]{.underline}, for
Smith, [runs the risk of despecifying, as well, the historical forces
that make "queerness" appear legible as an ontologically abstract force
in the first place: "what seems to disappear within queer theory's
subjectless critique are settler colonialism and the ongoing genocide of
Native peoples"]{.underline} (49).23 [When [queerness comes to indicate
an ontological or essential form of resistance]{.mark}, we can lose
sight of the conditions that make queerness as such legible in the first
place]{.underline}. Scott Morgensen describes this in terms of [[a
"settler rationality" at the heart of Western queer subject-formation;
"settler rationality" might thus be understood as a way for queer
whiteness to appropriate fantasized forms of primitive indigeneity, so
to naturalize the displacement and extermination of indigenous people
from the settler colony]{.underline}]{.mark}.24

Although this is a necessarily hasty summary of recent developments in
queer theory, we might say that the broadening of the ambit of [queer
study beyond the queer subject follows an "and/or" logic: it both
reaches toward historical materialist and (pace Ferguson) intersectional
analyses, and it has the potential to ["conspire" with the erasure of
the specificities of racial capitalism and the underlying
settler-colonial logic]{.mark} of modern Western culture]{.underline}.
Let us simply say, then, that [[the subjectless turn has been]{.mark} at
once a turn toward the historical specification of queerness in the
context of racial capitalism, and, at times, [a flight into an
ontological queerness]{.mark} that at times attenuates such
specification.]{.underline}

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Competing Pedagogies

#### Engaging in critical theories and pedagogies in order to have a competing narrative of oppression distracts from the initial problem of settler colonialism that enabled that oppression in the first place

**Byrd 11** (Jodi A., citizen of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma and
assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the
University of Illinois at Urbanandash;Champaign. "The Transit of Empire:
Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism," University of Minessota Press) AF

There is more than one way to frame the concerns of The Transit of
Empire and more than one way to enter into the possibilities that
transit might allow for comparative studies. On the one hand, [I am
seeking to join ongoing conversations about sovereignty, power, and
indigeneity---and the epistemological debates that each of these terms
engender---within and across disparate and at times incommensurable
disciplines and geographies. American studies, queer studies,
postcolonial studies, American In dian studies, and area studies have
all attempted to apprehend injury and redress, melancholy and grief that
exist in the distances and sutures of state recognitions and
belongings.]{.underline} Those distances and sutures of recognitions and
belongings, melancholy and grief, take this book from the worlds of
Southeastern Indians to Hawai\'i, from the Poston War Relocation Center
to Jonestown, Guyana, in order to consider how **[[ideas of "Indianness"
have created conditions of possibility for U. S. empire to manifest its
intent]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [As liberal multicultural settler
colonialism attempts to flex the exceptions and exclusions that first
constituted the United States to now provisionally include those people
othered and abjected from the nation-states origins, [it]{.mark} instead
**[creates a cacophony of moral claims that help to deflect]{.mark}
progressive and [transformative activism from dismantling the ongoing
conditions of colonialism that continue to make the United States a
desired state formation within which to be
included]{.mark}.**]{.underline} That cacophony of competing strug gles
for hegemony within and outside institutions of power, no matter how
those struggles might challenge the state through loci of race, class,
gender, and sexuality, serves to **[[misdirect and cloud attention from
the underlying structures of settler colonialism that made the United
States possible as oppressor in the first place.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
As a result, the cacophony produced through U.S. colonialism and
imperialism domestically and abroad often coerces struggles for social
justice for queers, racial minorities, and immigrants into complicity
with settler colonialism.

### 1NC \-- Root Cause \-- Heteropatriarchy

#### Heteronormativity in today's society can be directly traced back to settler colonialism

Queen's University, "Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and
Indigenous Decolonization", University of Minnesota Press, 11/17/11, pp.
31-53)//JSL

[Modern sexuality arises in settler societies as a function of the
biopolitics of settler colonialism]{.underline}. In the United States,
[[the sexual colonization of Native peoples produced]{.mark} modern
sexuality as [\"settler sexuality\": a white and national
heteronormativity formed by regulating native sexuality and
gende]{.mark}r while appearing to supplant them with the sexual
modernity of settlers.]{.underline} [[Queer modernities in a settler
society are produced in]{.mark} contextual [relation]{.mark}ship t[o the
settler colonial conditions of modern sexuality. White settlers]{.mark}
promulgating colonial heteropatriarchy [queered native peoples
and]{.mark} all [racialized]{.mark} subject [populations for elimination
and regulation]{.mark} by the biopolitics of settler
colonialism]{.underline}. Achille Mbembe has adapted Giorgio Agamben\'s
account of biopower to colonial situations by explaining colonial rule
as \"necropolitics,\" or a positioning of the space-time of the colony
in a state of exception to Western imperial rule.1 Mbembe invites
revisiting the racialization and sexualization of colonial situations,
including in white settler societies in the Americas that formed
multiracial societies from the transatlantic slave trade, colonized
indentured labor, and genocidal control of Indigenous peoples under
European settlement. However, to pursue such an account, scholars must
explain how the colony comes to be located in a state of exception in
context of white-supremacist settler colonialism and the logic of
Indigenous elimination. Mbembe\'s account limited its analysis to modern
regimes of colonial biopolitics that arose in the nineteenth-century
European franchise colonization of Africa and Asia. As a practice that
is not past but continues today, the biopolitics of settler colonialism
requires specific study.2 This chapter names necessary elements to such
an account, narrowed to explain the settler colonial necropolitics that
queered native peoples in the Americas by targeting modes of embodiment,
desire, and kinship that Native queer and Two-Spirit people reclaim as
their and their peoples\' histories. I argue that [[the biopolitics of
settler colonialism produces]{.mark} settler sexuality as [the context
traversed by]{.mark} non-Native and Native people formulating [queer
modernities]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The queering of native peoples
defined]{.underline}]{.mark} [not only settler sexuality, broadly, but
also the definition of [queer subjects]{.mark} among white settlers: [as
a primitive, racialized sexual margin]{.mark} akin to what white
settlers attempted to conquer among natives]{.underline}. when queer
white settlers reversed such discourses---notably by laying claim to the
colonial object berdache3---they argued their inclusion in settler
society by traversing normative paths to settler citizenship, which
incorporate and transcend ties to native roots to achieve national
belonging. non-native [queer modernities form by gathering a
multiracial, transnational constituency as a diversity that exists in a
non-native relationship to disappearing indigeneity]{.underline}. Yet,
[[narrating native disappearance distinguishes]{.mark} non-native queer
modernities from [the survival of native queer people, who negotiate
settler sexuality by recalling knowledges and practices queered by
colonial hetero-patriarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}. native people defined
unique identities, including two-Spirit, as modern, decolonizing native
critiques of settler colonialism and its structuring of non-native queer
projects. this chapter grounds my interpretation of non-native and
native queer modernities within a genealogy of white-supremacist settler
colonialism as the condition of sexual modernity and its contestation in
a settler society.

#### Settler colonialism is at the core of the heteropatriarchy, and critiques of such heteronormativity that fail to first comprehend that role recreate settler colonialism -- only a prior breakdown of the politics of the settler can resolve either impact

**Morgensen 11** (Scott Lauria, assistant professor of gender studies at
Queen's University, "Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and
Indigenous Decolonization", University of Minnesota Press, 11/17/11, pp.
1-28)//JSL

This book examines how **[[settler colonial power relations among native
and non-native people define the status
\"queer]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" It argues that [modern queer subjects,
cultures, and politics have developed among natives and non-natives in
linked, yet distinct, ways]{.underline}. [The imposition of [colonial
heteropatriarchy relegates native people and all non-native people of
color to queered statuses]{.mark} as racialized populations amid
colonial efforts to eliminate native nationality and settle native
lands]{.underline}. [[Modern sexuality comes into existence when the
heteropatriarchal advancement of white settlers appears to vanquish
sexual primitivity]{.underline}]{.mark}, which white settlers
nevertheless adopt as their own history. [When modern sexuality queers
white settlers, [their effort to reclaim a place within settler society
produces white]{.mark} and non-native [queer politics for recognition by
the state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet [memories and practices of
discrepant sexual cultures among Indigenous peoples and peoples of color
persistently trouble the white settler logics of sexual
modernity]{.underline}. For instance, native modes of kinship,
embodiment, and desire such as those today called \"Two-Spirit\" produce
Native queer modernities that denaturalize settler colonialism. **[the
comparative studies in this book show [settler colonialism as the
context in which non-native and native people produce modern queer
subjects, cultures, and politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
methodological shift in native studies heralded by such scholars as
Linda Tuhiwai Smith and Robert warrior theorizes settler colonialism by
tracing the \"intellectual histories\" (Warrior) and methods of Native
peoples practicing survival, resistance, and decolonization.2
Scholarship in settler colonial studies must support this turn, as when
Patrick Wolfe theorizes settler colonialism as \"a structure, not an
event\" that calls for a sustained denaturalizing critique.3 Andrea
Smith calls on Native studies to refuse its \"ethnographic entrapment\"
in the description of Native cultures and instead become an
interdisciplinary site for explaining and transforming a world defined
by settler colonialism.4 She promotes this shift by invoking queer
theory, which displaced the description of sexual minorities in
gay/lesbian studies by theorizing heteronormativity as a power relation
that conditions all subjects and social life.5 [Scholars at the
intersections of Native and queer studies have responded to these calls
by demonstrating that each field is intrinsic to the
other]{.underline}.6 Smith explains that \"[[the heteronormativity of
settler colonialism\" has subjected Native and non-Native people to
settler colonial rule]{.mark} and regimes of modern
sexuality]{.underline}. In this context, \"[queer\" statuses accrue to
nonheteronormative identities---such as gay, lesbian, bisexual,
transgender, or queer---**[after colonial heteropatriarchy first
redefines embodiment, desire, and kinship to eliminate Native culture,
control racialized populations, and secure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
Sherene Razack\'s term, **[[a \"white settler
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" In this book, queer will refer to
statuses produced by the heteropatriarchal power of white supremacist
settler colonialism. My analysis joins critics of homo-normativity in
arguing that all \"queer\" statuses are not equivalent.7 Jasbir Puar
critiques \"homonationalism\" as the process whereby whiteness and
imperialism create U.S. queer subjects as \"regulatory\" over peoples
queered by U.S. rule.8 I resituate Puar\'s account to argue that **[in a
white settler society[, queer politics produces a settler
homonationalism that will persist unless settler colonialism is
challenged directly]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a condition of queer
modernities]{.underline}.9 [Native and queer studies must regard settler
colonialism as a key condition of modern sexuality on stolen land, and
use this analysis to explain the power of settler colonialism among
Native and non-Native people]{.underline}. This book investigates how
settler colonialism produces what I call \"non-Native queer
modernities,\" in which [modern queers appear definitively not
Native---separated from, yet in perpetual (negative) relationship to,
the original peoples of the lands where they live]{.underline}. The
phrase suggests [a settler colonial logic that disappears indigeneity so
it can be recalled by modern non-natives as a relationship to native
culture and land that might reconcile them to inheriting
conquest]{.underline}.10 Thus, \"non-native\" signifies not a racial or
ethnic identity but a location within settler colonialism. [non-native
queer modernities naturalize settler colonialism when they confront
queer differences as racial or diasporic in a manner that sustains
native disappearance]{.underline}. If queer subjects align with
whiteness or homonationalism, their settler colonial roots may seem
clear. But **[[even multiracial and transnational queer critiques of
racism and imperialism can erase native people]{.mark} and naturalize
settler colonialism]{.underline}** [in ways that indirectly or directly
define queer modernity as not native]{.underline}. This book examines
\"native queer modernities\" as projects that formed historically
precisely to displace the settler colonial logics that sustain
\"non-native queer modernities.\"

#### Theorizations of queerness that don't centralize settler colonialism recreate queer citizenship and homonationalism

**Morgensen 10** \[2010, Scott Lauria Morgensen, SETTLER
HOMONATIONALISM, GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 16,
Number 1-2: 105-131\]

[Modern sexuality arose]{.underline} in the United States [as crucial to
a colonial society of normalization. The violent sexual regulation of
Native peoples became a proving ground for forming settler
subjects]{.underline} as agents and beneficiaries of modern sexuality.
Their subject positions arose relationally within the colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality and call for broad analysis in queer,
American, and Native studies. 40 I now ask how colonial histories made
settlement a primary condition of the formation of modern queer subjects
and politics in the United States. I reexamine scholarship in queer
studies that suggests this claim, and I mark how future queer
scholarship can center the study of settler colonialism, including as a
condition of homonationalism. Settler colonialism is the open secret in
most historical work in U.S. sexuality studies and queer studies.
[[Settler colonialism **conditioned every aspect of**]{.mark} **the
history of [sexuality in the United States]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
only rarely has it been made a focus of study. My account has suggested
a convergence between the sexual colonization of Native peoples and the
growth in the United States of techniques of modern sexuality. These
proliferated in the decades following the frontier's "closure," a time
that in fact represented a heyday of state and religious efforts to
institute a colonial education of desire, as in the events at the Crow
Agency or during the 1879 -- 1918 tenure of the Carlisle Indian School.
Far from reflecting finality, this period witnessed tense negotiations
of active and contested settlement. In such a time, any iteration of
modern sexuality that placed Native people in the past knew itself to be
a contingent claim that remained open to challenge. Thus scholars must
recognize that modern sexuality is not a product of settler colonialism,
as if it came into being in the United States after settlement
transpired. Modern sexuality arose in the United States as a method to
produce [settler colonialism, and settler subjects, by facilitating
ongoing conquest and naturalizing its effects. The normative function of
[settlement is]{.mark} to appear inevitable and final]{.underline}. [It
is n[aturalized again **whenever**]{.mark} **sexuality or queer studies
[scholars inscribe it as an unexamined backdrop to]{.mark} the
historical formation of [modern U.S. sexual
cultures]{.mark}**]{.underline} and politics. Scholars in Native and
American studies have theorized settler colonialism as the social
processes and narratives that displace Native people while granting
settlers belonging to Native land and settler society. With Renée
Bergland and James Cox, I examine how this displacement is enabled by
settler narratives of Native absence or disappearance.41 Both terms
share a quality of invoking the very thing being argued as not present.
Stories of Native absence or disappearance thus precisely do not erase
Native people but produce particular forms of knowledge about Native
people, as already or inevitably gone. Cox argues that tales of Native
disappearance should also be read as narratives of settlement. The very
absence of Native people in a story is telling us a story about
qualities of settler subjects, cultures, and social life. Queer
scholarship on race and sexuality has been effective at marking colonial
relations and discourses and inviting the study of settlement. Scholars
reveal that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, sexual
sciences and civil institutions distinguished primitive from civilized
sexuality in order to define queer margins for sexual normality. Eithne
Luibhéid and Roderick Ferguson explain how Asian immigrants and
conquered Mexicans after the midnineteenth century, and African
Americans during slavery and the Jim Crow society, were produced as
racial and sexual populations for national regulation.42 Queers of color
in such contexts were targeted for control, but as emblems of entire
racial populations to be queered as the primitive margins of national
whiteness and its civilizational sexuality.43 In turn, Jennifer Terry
and George Chauncey, among others, explain how sexual sciences
classified perversions by documenting white subjects as degenerates who
had regressed to prior stages of racial evolution. 44 In early activism,
white sexual minorities reversed discourse on sexual primitivity in
order to embrace it as a nature deserving recognition by modern
citizenship. In the United States, Harry Hay organized the Mattachine
Society by referencing stories of berdache as the primitive nature of
sexual minorities and as a primitive model of acceptance that modern
societies could emulate --- themes that were sustained in homophile and
gay and lesbian civil rights activism.45 Each such moment is illuminated
by its relation to settlement. As Luibhéid's remarkable historical
research suggests, the structural locations of non- Native people of
color within the biopolitics of modern sexuality in the colonial and
imperial United States align with those assigned to Native peoples by
sexual colonization.46 Their distinctive encounters with racial and
sexual power thus may be examined as interrelated effects of the United
States forming as a colonial power through processes of settlement. Yet
studying their ties also will mark the many nonidentical locations
occupied by non-Natives, including queers of color, in relation to
Native people under colonial conditions of settlement. In turn[,
[white]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[sexual minorities who defended their
sexual primitivity **articulated normative practices of settler
citizenship**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Philip Deloria and Amy Kaplan have
examined settler citizenship as based on the conquest and incorporation
of primitivity, so that primitivity becomes a resource to be drawn on
when asserting the unique strengths of a settler civilization.47 Modern
sexuality discourses also taught white U.S. American men to tap and
control their primitive roots, as when G. Stanley Hall's recapitulation
theory of play or youth health movements in the YMCA invited white youth
to explore primitive developmental stages so as to become civilized
adults with virile sex and sexuality.48 White U.S. sexual minorities
thus organized in a political culture that already validated a journey
to personhood and citizenship that translated primitive roots into
settler modernity. Defending primitive sexual nature, which could
include appropriating Native American culture as part of their history,
translated their queer marginality into a normative assertion of settler
citizenship. Focusing on settlement also marks the way that theories of
degeneration assigned to modern queers in the early-twentieth-century
United States presumed Native disappearance. As degenerates, [modern
queers appeared as failed subjects, incapable of representing either
white civilization or authentic primitivity]{.underline}. Yet [this
framing **also naturalized them across racial differences as
non-Native**]{.underline}, in that it presumed that authentic Native
people had already disappeared from the modern and settled spaces where
queer degenerates would be found. If living Native people ever did
appear in those spaces, they tended to present as out of place. For
instance, Nayan Shah's compelling history of sexuality and migration
cites a California police report from 1918, which criminalized a
relationship between a South Asian migrant man and an American Indian
youth by narrating it as sexual predation. This regulatory moment
occurred amid recent histories of scalp bounties and massacres targeting
Native peoples across Northern California, including only two years
after the death of Ishi, famed survivor of the Yahi tribe. How might
popular narratives of lost Native authenticity have shaped the police
description of the youth only by his town of origin (Truckee) and his
assimilation into a multiracial underclass? How, still, might tales of
sexual primitivity persist, as his framing as the passive object of his
racialized partner's desire suggests (without naming) the logic of
berdache? 49 In turn, Siobhan Somerville and Kevin Mumford have shown
how popular stories and social practices in the early twentieth century
linked homosexuality to miscegenation, including representing it as
emblematic of white "slumming" for sexual adventure in African American
districts of New York City and Chicago.50 Yet in the Northeast,
blackness already connoted historical miscegenation with Indianness. Amy
den Ouden has explained how in the wake of normative associations of
Native people with blackness in New England, Native communities with
black family lines could be marked by white authorities as racially
inauthentic, thereby delegitimating their Native identities and land
claims. In light of this, by the early twentieth century, how did
discourses on sexual perversion tie Indianness and blackness to
homosexuality, and how did they interlink? Did the histories of
black-Indian communities and of their regulation shape modern racial
theories of homosexuality? What would a queer history of homosexuality
and miscegenation look like if Indianness --- as an identity, or an
object of colonial discourse --- were crucial to analysis?51 [[Queer
studies **must center settler colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
processes of settlement in order to pursue these directions in
scholarship. Settler colonialism appears in the relational of colonial
and modern sexual regimes; in narratives of sexuality and gender based
on Native absence and disappearance, despite evidence of Native survival
and resistance; and in the normative formation of settler sexual
subjects, cultures, and politics. I argue that queer **[[accounts of
settler colonialism will be supported by studying the colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The frame of
colonial biopolitics makes the discursive and institutional
relationality of Native and settler subject positions relevant to any
account of modern sexuality in the United States. While such accounts
have tended to exclude Native people, biopolitics marks erasure as
meaningful to narrating settlement, even as that move can be
investigated for evidence of the irruption of Native people amid stories
of their demise. The frame of colonial biopolitics will also mark how
the power relations structuring "Native" and "settler" articulate
diverse people, cultures, and politics across differences of race,
nation, class, disability, gender, and sexuality that exceed these two
terms and their opposition. Yet the normativity of the terms within
colonial biopolitics will still inform every U.S. formation of modern
sexuality. Studying their relationality can recall that the locations
they define for Native people always are exceeded by the discrepant
histories and epistemologies of Native people's interdependent and
resistant lives. In turn, the term non-Native can help mark how subjects
outside Native communities incompletely fit the term settler --- whether
excluded from it categorically or asked to pass through or appeal to it
--- as they negotiate varied non-Native lives in a settler society.
Differences among non-Native people of color, or between them and white
people, thus will not be erased by marking their shared inheritance of
settler colonialism; indeed, doing so will mark those differences, even
as their distinctive relationships to settler colonialism and its
naturalization become relevant to study.52 In the process, analyzing the
colonial biopolitics of modern sexuality will focus queer studies on the
work of denaturalizing settlement. I mean here not just that settler
colonialism will be marked as a condition of all modern sexual power in
the United States but also that the meaningfulness of its naturalization
will become a major area of study. We need many more, and more detailed
accounts of the subjects, institutions, and power relations that form
whenever settler colonialism is naturalized within modern queer projects
in the United States. [My argument invites scholars to return to
**[homonationalism]{.mark} and explain it as [one crucial effect of the
settler histories of modern sexuality]{.mark}** [in the United
States]{.mark}. We will see that if [non-Native queers become sexual
subjects]{.mark} of life, **they will do so [by joining a colonial
biopolitics of modern sexuality that functions to produce modern queers
as settler subjects]{.mark} in relation to Native
peoples**]{.underline}. Normatively white and national queer politics
will arise here by naturalizing settler colonialism, notably when
appeals to the settler state fail to trouble its colonial relation to
Native peoples and its enforcement of a settler society.53 To invoke
Puar, the settler formation of U.S. queer projects will make them "queer
as regulatory" over Native peoples, whose social lives will appear
distant in time and space despite the continued existence of collective
and allied Native activisms for decolonization and calls to non-Natives
to join. Homonationalism will arise here, where the historical and
contemporary activity of settler colonialism conditions queer
modernities in the United States.

The question arises, then, why is settler colonialism so seriously
undertheorized in queer studies, even within queer of color critique?
One possibility may be that∂ **[[queer studies has not
considered]{.mark} the possibility of [alternative forms of national-ism
that are not structured by nation-states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To be
fair, [queer theory does offer strong critiques of the heteronormativity
of the nation-state as well as the heter-onormativity of the citizen,
particularly the U.S. citizen]{.underline}. Puar's and Gopinath'swork
demonstrates how the noncitizen, particularly in the ﬁgure of the
refugee or the immigrant, queers the state's heteronormativity. Berlant
also looks at how queer activist groups within the United States attempt
to reconﬁgure citizenship within the current nation-state and even to
question the "censoring imaginary of the state."∂ 66∂ Muñoz similarly
gestures to "beyond" the current political system when he says, "[Our
charge as spectators and actors is to continue disidentifying with this
world until we achieve new ones]{.underline}."∂ 67∂ Thus, queer
theorists seem to exhibit some desire to think beyond the nation-state
.At the same time, **[[queer theory seems to lapse back into presuming
the givenness of]{.mark} the nation-state in general, and [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in particular.]{.underline}**
Forinstance, Berlant contends: "It must be emphasized . . . that
disidentiﬁcation with U.S. nationality is not, at this moment, even a
theoretical option for queer citizens. . . .We are compelled, then, to
read America's lips. What can we do to force the ofﬁ-cially constituted
nation to speak a new political tongue?"∂ 68[∂]{.underline}
[[This]{.mark} statement curi-ously [occludes]{.mark} the struggles of
many [indigenous peoples who have articulated themselves as]{.mark}
belonging to [sovereign nations]{.mark} rather than as being U.S.
citizens]{.underline}.[The reason for this occlusion can be found in
another statement: Berlant contendsthat Native peoples "have long
experienced simultaneously the wish to be fullcitizens and the violence
of their partial citizenship]{.underline}."∂ 69[∂ She collapses Native
peo-ples into the category of racial minority rather than recognize them
as colonized peoples struggling against a settler state]{.underline}. So
[the settler state is presumed within queer theory]{.underline}, while
(as mentionedpreviously) indigenous nationhood is imagined [as simply a
primitive mirror image of a heteronormative state]{.underline}. However,
many Native scholars and activists are offering internal critiques of
contemporary Native politics to imagine potentially nonheter-onormative
forms of indigenous nationhood. As Taiaiake Alfred, Glen
Coulthard,Denetdale, and others note, **[[Native]{.mark} sovereignty
[struggles are]{.mark} themselves often [articulated
within]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather than in resistance to, **[[the
logics of settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.∂ 70∂ That is,
**[[articulations of Native]{.mark} governance and [sovereignty]{.mark}
often [mimic the logics of the settler state]{.mark} rather than draw on
forms of indigenous governance that call into question many of the
logics of nation-state forms of governance.]{.underline}** As they
argue, [Native sovereignty struggles often focus on gaining recognition
from the surround-ing settler state. To gain this recognition, Native
nations model themselves after∂ colonial states, mirroring their similar
colonial logics]{.underline}. Coulthard explains that this politics of
recognition also entraps colonized peoples in a death dance with their
colonizers. The "key problem with the politics of recognition when
applied to thecolonial context . . . \[is that it\] rests on the
problematic assumption that the ﬂour-ishing of Indigenous Peoples as
distinct and self-determining agents is somehow dependent on their being
granted recognition and institutional accommodation from the surrounding
settler-state and society. . . . Not only will the terms of rec-ognition
tend to remain the property of those in power to grant to their
inferiorsin ways that they deem appropriate, but also under these
conditions, the Indig-enous population will often come to see their
limited and structurally constrained terms of recognition granted to
them as∂ their own∂ . In effect, the colonized come to∂ identify∂ with
'white liberty and white justice.' "∂ 71∂ He calls on indigenous
activiststo shift their focus from seeking recognition from the settler
state to seeking rec-ognition from each other as well as other oppressed
communities. Native peoples'ethnographic entrapment within the academy
presumes the politics of recognitionthat Coulthard critiques. That is,
Native peoples are compelled to represent them-selves properly in order
to gain recognition within the academy --- they are notsupposed to deﬁne
the terms of discourse itself. ∂ As I have discussed elsewhere,
**[[these alternative models of sovereignty are not]{.mark} based [on a
narrow deﬁnition of nation that entails]{.mark} a closely bounded
com-munity and [ethnic cleansing]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
[Native activists often articulate indigenous forms of nationhood
organized around a logic of citizenship based less on rights withina
nation and more on a system of interrelatedness and mutual
responsibility]{.underline}.∂ 72**[∂ Because [these visions of national
liberation do not]{.mark} necessarily [entail a nation-state form of
governance]{.mark} as their end goal, they do not imagine a social
struc-ture based on social domination]{.underline}**. As such,
[[they]{.mark} can∂ potentially∂ [challenge logics of
heteronormativity]{.mark} because heteropatriarchy is a logic that
naturalizes socialhierarchy]{.underline}. That is, if under the logic of
heteropatriarchy, men are supposed torule women on the basis of biology,
this social hierarchy becomes naturalized. As Karen Warren notes, social
domination is effective primarily because it seemsnatural --- otherwise,
there is no reason why people would want to live under con-ditions of
domination.∂ 73∂ **[[Once we challenge the idea that domination
is]{.mark} somehow "[human nature," we have the potential to question
the naturalization of all its manifestations, including
heteropatriarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Gender and settlerism are intrinsically tied together- Heteropatriarchal colonialism has sexualized indigenous lands while transforming native people into violable subjugated kin to be assimilated into white settler societies- colonial heteropatriarchy structures the lives of all indigenous persons, and that divesting from it will be necessary to collective work for decolonisation.

[Indigenous feminist and LGBTQ/Two-Spirit criticisms have established
the ineluctably gendered and sexual quality of settlers' attempted
conquest of indigenous peoples. **This literature teaches that
[heteropatriarchal colonialism has sexualised indigenous lands and
peoples as violable, subjugated indigenous kin ties as perverse,
attacked familial ties and traditional gender roles]{.mark}, and all [to
transform indigenous peoples for assimilation]{.mark} within or excision
from the political and economic structures of white settler
societies**.]{.underline}1 Although these lessons are recorded in
scholarly texts, the violences they name have been challenged by
indigenous women and LGBTQ/Two-Spirit people who organise for their own
and their people's liberations. Among many examples, the Aboriginal
women's movement in Canada, Two-Spirit organising across North America,
and takatapui organising in Aotearoa New Zealand offer grounded theories
of gendered and sexual colonisation and of indigenous resistance.2
[Crucially, **such movements do not restrict their address to persons
so-identified, for they argue that [colonial heteropatriarchy structures
the lives of all indigenous persons,]{.mark} and that divesting from it
will be necessary to collective work for decolonisation. Activist and
intellectual legacies such as these make possible this collection and
its investigations of gender, sexuality, and settler colonialism, and
recur continually in our account**s]{.underline}. 'Calling', Karangatia,
invokes the opening of an exchange of words in which Morgensen,
'Theorising Gender, Sexuality, and Settler Colonialism' 5 many will
listen and may eventually speak, but within a context first defined by
[[indigenous women]{.mark} who [call a diversity of gendered and sexual
subjects into conversation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This title, by Michelle
Erai's suggestion, positions both the issue's contents and our
collaboration as co-editors. Whereas I write this introduction as sole
author, I do so to present my response as a white settler critic to a
context of speaking, listening, learning, and acting that has been
defined by the calls of indigenous feminist and LGBTQ/Two-Spirit
scholars and activists. [With these histories in mind, this introduction
and our collection theorise gender, sexuality, and settler colonialism
by advancing beyond similar scholarship in colonial studies. For some
time now, the very ubiquity of feminist and queer accounts in colonial
studies has appeared to explain gender and sexuality in settler-colonial
situations. Yet as recent scholarship indicates[, the specificity of
settler colonialism is obscured]{.mark} if it is presumed to have been
explained by general theories of 'colonialism'.3 All such theories must
be revisited to ask if they erroneously generalise specific colonial
situations, and to provincialise all such situations by positioning them
comparatively. Scholars in colonial and postcolonial studies long have
observed that [colonial rule comes into being by mobilising gendered and
sexual power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet this observation in itself does
not denaturalise gender or sexuality, as is apparent when even major
texts in these fields leave the impression that a natural gendered or
sexual order underlies what colonial violence produced.4 Anticolonial
feminist and queer accounts show that colonisation's sexual and gendered
methods are inventive, not foreordained; and that liberation will follow
disturbing all that colonisation taught, so that distinctive ways of
life might be recalled or imagined. [Such accounts position 'gender' and
'sexuality' alongside 'race' and 'nation' as analytical categories that
are freed from any universal referent, in that they designate
power-laden arenas of contested knowledge and embodied practice that
call for critical and creative engagement.]{.underline} While such
insights appear diversely without cohering in any single body of work,
they were made possible by the signal contributions of critics within
feminist antiracist and anticolonial movements. Indigenous, Black,
US/Third World, and women of Morgensen, 'Theorising Gender, Sexuality,
and Settler Colonialism' 6 colour feminisms synergised with feminists
engaged in anticolonial and postcolonial nationalism to displace white
settler and Western feminist thought: a history that at the end of the
20th century produced postcolonial and transnational feminisms as arenas
where scholars across the global north and south could form alliances in
critiquing colonial, racial, gendered, and sexual power.5 The scholarly
projects of queer of colour and queer diasporic critique formed in
relation to these lineages, as have transnational queer studies that
trouble racial or diasporic identity to address the global and imperial
scales of sexual power.6 [Denaturalising gender, sexuality, race, and
nation is a hallmark of such work, as when Chandra Mohanty's review of
writings from the 1980s argued for '**[the inherently political
definition of the term women of color' as designating 'a political
constituency]{.mark}, not a biological or even sociological one' [that
coheres around 'a common context of
struggle]{.mark}**[']{.mark}.]{.underline} 7 Jacqui Alexander joined
Chandra Mohanty in emphasising their commitments to decolonisation,
arguing that if 'decolonization involves thinking oneself out of the
spaces of domination', then this will transpire only 'through praxis',
which they sought by holding their work responsible to 'the concrete
analyses of collective and organizational practice within feminist
communities that offer provisional strategies for dismantling the
psychic and social constellations put in place by colonization'. 8

#### Feminist work needs to center settler colonialism---the aff devolves to a liberal multiculturalism where the demands of Indigenous women can never be met. Decolonization is necessary to any true project of emancipation---anything else furthers whiteness and its global settling missions like the war on terror.

[[Native feminist theories centrally address two intertwined ideas that
are significant but often overlooked in feminist discourses: the United
States]{.mark} and many other Western countries]{.underline}, including
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, [[are settler colonial
nation-states, and settler colonialism has been and continues to be a
gendered process]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because [the United States is
balanced upon notions of white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, everyone
living in the country is not only racialized and gendered, but also has
a relationship to settler colonialism. [Native feminist theories offer
new and reclaimed ways of thinking through not only how settler
colonialism has impacted Indigenous and settler communities, but also
how feminist theories can imagine and realize different modes of
nationalism]{.mark} and alliances in the future]{.underline} (see also
Smith 2007).1 This article highlights five central challenges that
Native feminist theories pose to gender and women's studies. [With these
challenges, we offer suggestions for meaningful engagement, arguing
overall that attending to the links between heteropatriarchy and settler
colonialism is intellectually and politically imperative.]{.underline}
Although this article focuses primarily on gender and women's studies,
[Native feminist theories also importantly highlight how ethnic studies
has failed to adequately address settler colonialism]{.underline}.
[[Attending to settler colonialism requires a significant departure from
how gender and women's studies and ethnic studies are regularly
understood and taught]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conventionally, it is
assumed that gender and women's studies is inclusive of those who
identify as women and indeed all people who are gendered, and that
ethnic studies addresses Indigenous concerns, along with those of other
ethnic groups. These fields teach people to think about themselves in
relation to a gendered and racialized society (Omi and Winant 1994).
However, [engaging settler colonialism involves different frameworks
from the ones these fields often prioritize. While both gender and
women's studies and ethnic studies unmask gender and race as social
constructions, with often devastating material effects for women and
nonwhite people, respectively, these fields also expose various
mythologies about gender and race, including the myth of misogyny and
racism as to-be-expected characteristics of human nature]{.underline}.
Yet, within this important work, [[too often the consideration of
Indigenous peoples remains rooted in understanding
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark} (like statesanctioned slavery) [as an
historical point in time away from which our society has progressed.
Centering settler colonialism within gender and women's studies and
ethnic studies instead exposes the still-existing structure of settler
colonization and its powerful effects on Indigenous peoples and
others]{.underline}. This recognition within gender and women's studies
and ethnic studies makes possible new visions of what decolonization
might look like for all peoples. [It also opens up the possibility of
new forms of activism based on critically thought-out alliances, rather
than always taking the shape of alliances within and between seemingly
naturally formed and identifiable groups of people---namely, women and
people of color---as given.]{.underline} In fact, [the prevalence of
liberal multicultural discourses today effectively works to maintain
settler colonialism because they make it easy to assume that all
minorities and ethnic groups are different though working toward
inclusion and equality, each in its own similar and parallel
way]{.underline}. Justice is often put in terms that coincide with the
expansion of the settler state (see Scott Lauria Morgensen \[2011\] for
a discussion of the compatibility of queer politics with white
normativity and settler society). [While Indigenous peoples do form
important alliances with people of color, Indigenous communities'
concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights
within a nationstate, but instead achieving substantial independence
from a Western nationstate--- independence decided on their own
terms]{.underline}. The feminist concerns of white women, women of
color, and Indigenous women thus often differ and conflict with one
another. [In other words, within the context of land and settler
colonialism, the issues facing Indigenous women, as inseparable from the
issues facing Indigenous peoples as a whole, are resolved via
decolonization and sovereignty, not (just) parity.]{.underline} We write
as three Indigenous women--identified scholars situated variously in the
disciplines of ethnic studies, education, and Indigenous studies.2 [Each
of us works to apply Indigenous theories and decolonizing frameworks to
contemporary social realities in order to contest the rampant
misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples and their lives in school
curricula, the media, and the sociological imagination, and Native
feminism has given us important tools to do such work.]{.underline} We
believe that the challenges this article describes will be relevant to
many disciplines, including our home disciplines of ethnic studies,
education, and Indigenous studies, where feminist theories have long
been important[. Yet, we address this article primarily to theorists and
activists of mainstream, or "whitestream," feminism, as well as to other
feminisms and nationalisms, including Asian, black, Latina, third world,
transnational, and queer feminisms and nationalisms, because greater
engagement between Native feminist theories and other feminisms is
sorely needed]{.underline}.3 [[Our challenges respectfully push both
conventional modes of feminism and more radical ones]{.mark}, as we see
the need to interrogate everywhere what Rey Chow has termed "the
ascendancy of whiteness," a concept denoting the multiple ways that the
condition of being white, and enjoying the often nationalist privileges
of that whiteness, is made to seem neutral and inviting or inclusive of
racial, sexual, and other minorities]{.underline} (Chow, qtd. in
Morgensen 2010, 105; see also Puar 2007). By being included (whether by
choice, coercion, or force) [[in whiteness, a wide array of Indigenous
peoples, people of color, and queer communities are given the
"opportunity" to take part in the settling processes that dispossess
just such "other-ed" peoples globally]{.underline}.]{.mark} Such
opportunities include everything from participating in the global War on
Terror, as scholars like Jasbir K. Puar (2007) brilliantly critique, to
naturalizing and maintaining settler colonialism in the United States.
We argue that [allying one's self with feminism should not require
consenting to inclusion within a larger agenda of
whiteness]{.underline}; indeed, we believe that [Native feminist
theories]{.underline} demonstrate that feminisms, when allied with other
key causes, [hold a unique potential to decolonize the ascendancy of
whiteness in many global contexts.]{.underline}

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Queer Subject Formation

#### Queer Subject formation depends upon indigeneity as a transitive site for the manifestation of desire as a subject.

Jodi A. **Byrd 18** (citizen of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma and

University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign where she is also a faculty

"LOVING UNBECOMING: The Queer Politics of the Transitive Native,"
[CRITICALLY SOVEREIGN: Indigenous Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist
Studies,]{.underline} joanne barker,-editor, /ejb)

As an emergent field in its own right, then, queer Indigenous studies
has begun to stage difficult and important questions about the nature of
identity and its discontents, posing quandaries about the possibilities
and limits of the transformative politics of gender and sexuality
especially where they intersect with race, transnationalism, and
colonialism. As queer Indigenous studies begins to articulate some of
the stakes for culturally and tribally inflected counter-practices of
gender and sexuality, kinship, governance, and relationally, one of the
remaining challenges for the field is to interrogate whether the queer
in Indigenous studies is the same as the queer in queer studies. At
first blush, it might be tempting to assume that the answer is
self-evident, the question slightly coy. The question, however, might
trouble some of the methodological, theoretical, and quotidian horizons
that intersectionality and interdisciplinarity seek to make visible
within the fields of Indigenous, gender, and sexuality studies. The
queer within Indigenous studies has already come to signify a range of
prescribed practices attached to decolonizing desire, gender
performance, kinship socialities, and relationities to land and
community. Faced with the quandaries that the colonial, racial,
gendered, and historical disjunctions of encounter, contact, and
orientation have left us, what can desire and grief mean to the
colonized if they signal, at their core, modes of dispossession,
undoing, firsting, and lasting? What might the subjectlessness that
Andrea Smith suggests as intervention to ethnographic entrapment offer
queer Indigenous critique if it disallows anything fixed, grounded,
located, or, most important, accountable to community, relationality,
and connection? [As a concept, indigeneity admittedly has had and has
required a political referent that is tied to land, relation, and
community, even if such referents are fluid and mutable. But at the same
time, and as an ideological referent that is always up for grabs,
indigeneity remains elusive, ontologically ephemeral, temporally
challenged, and captured within the discourses of discovery,
enlightennment, and sovereignty. Caught within modes of possession and
its lack, Indigenous subjectlessness at the site of the queer
simultaneously straddles the threshold between the colonialist practices
of replacing the Indigenous, on the one hand, and emptying the
Indigenous of any prior signification, on the other]{.underline}. [In
the grammars of empire where subject formation occurs through the
Hegelian dialectics of freedom and enslavement, ownership and property,
civilized and savage, sovereign and beast, the Indigenous might be
understood as the domain or register in which the tensions between and
among these antagonisms become sensible]{.underline}. [Indigeneity's
challenge to settler colonial subjectivity and its loss, then, requires
us to shift the frame slightly askew to apprehend how the processes of
subjectivity---be they queer or normative---cohere, entangle, and
unravel in relation to what Elizabeth Povinelli has identified as the
governance of the prior. That governance, defined as "the priority of
the prior person (or people) as a natural right of all persons and the
people as such emerged as an impediment to the previous logics of kingly
seizure and to the emergent logic of colonial governance," hinges on an
unresolvable temporal paradox that produces the conditions of
indigeneity as prior to and a priority of the law at the same time that
the law abjects indigeneity from having any priority at
all]{.underline}.24 Returning to a distinction within the
conceptualization of subjectless critique may help parse some of these
tensions that exist within and between the queer and the Indigenous that
have made questions of subjectivity and its temporality so fraught. In
Imagine Otherwise, Kandice Chuh advocates for the creation of
subjectlessness as a way to "prioritize difference by foregrounding the
discursive constructedness of subjectivity," where the subject "only
becomes recognizable and can act as such by conforming to certain
regulatory matrices."25 [[I want to pry open this space of subjectivity,
its regulatory matrices, and its queer refusals to posit that a prior
presence, whether we name it Indigenous or something else, retains key
transitive properties that enable and, in fact, are required to adhere
relationality within the intimacies and violence of
empire]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Karen Elizabeth Gordon,
[[transitive verbs "are those that cannot complete their meaning without
the help of a direct object]{.underline}]{.mark}."26 [[Like vampires,
such verbs feed off an object to sustain, fulfill, and extend themselves
in embodied orientations that require the object in order to exist. Such
orientations,]{.underline}]{.mark} after Sara Ahmed, "[[are about the
intimacy of bodies and their dwelling places"; they "allow us then to
rethink the phenomenality of space---that is, how space is dependent on
bodily inhabitance]{.underline}]{.mark}." 27 [[Caught in a transitive
relationality with indigeneity, settlers cannot achieve their sovereign
subjectivities and embodiments without the help of the Native as object
to orient them]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [[the discursive
frameworks and "regulatory matrices" of the subject have already been
formulated in response to the colonization of American Indians. Within
the structuring elements of settler colonialism, subjectivity, claiming
to be, and speaking for have gone hand in hand with the theft of lands,
the politics of replacement, and the forced normativities of compulsory
heterosexuality and lineal descent]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The fraught
and contradictory desires for and against subjectivities embedded within
the ontological orientations of empire are located within the diversity
of experiences that have shaped such positionalities as settler,
arrivant, and Native]{.underline}. These colonial contexts inform modern
claims to Indigenous identity within the racial regimes of U.S.
neoliberal multiculturalism and intersect with those queer politics that
disrupt static, essential, and normalized privileges of race, class, and
gender, on the one hand, and Indigenous identities that are tied to
community recognition, sovereignty, and land, on the other. [[How might
desire]{.underline}]{.mark}---which, as Holland has argued, is
imbricated within quotidian racist practices---[[function to reproduce
the logics of dispossession at the site of reinvention and becoming for
the other?]{.underline}]{.mark} The U.S. Supreme Court, building on an
interlocking foundation of precedence for its juridical authority,
issued four rulings in June 2013 that hinged on equal protection to
arbitrate the triad of sexuality, race, and indigeneity. [In the process
of maintaining white normativity within heterosexual---and now, by
extension, same-sex--- family units, the court inveighed on Indigenous
identity, fearing the possibility of a remote Indian ancestor to be a
disability hampering a child's full incorporation into the rights due
her as a transracial Indian-into- white subject. That fear not only
demonstrates the degree to which the legal normativities of embodied
ability depend on racializing and colonizing logics to produce the
righted subject, but also highlights the transitive form through which
the law interpellates indigeneity as difference and
recourse]{.underline}. But how did indigeneity become transitive within
the regulative fictions of rights and liberties? That answer might be
found within the racial integrity acts of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries that the Loving v. Virginia landmark ruling in 1967
purportedly overturned. By framing these concerns at a slight slant, it
is my hope that we might be able to begin to apprehend how [[desire and
identity function within the context of an ongoing colonialism that
adjudicates inclusion and exclusion through a transitive relationality
that requires the Native other to make visible the biopolitical
structures of race, sexuality, gender, and
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Anti-Normativity

#### Adopting the position of queer anti-normativity inverts rather than eliminates the structures of oppression. 

**Oswin, 2008** (Natalie -- Department of Geography @ the National
University of Singapore, "Critical Geographies and the Uses of
Sexuality: Deconstructing Queer Space", *Progress in Human Geography*
32.1, shae)

This move to distinguish queer geographies from the mere study of sexual
others is a productive one since queer is indeed not merely a synonym
for LGBT. [[Queer theory is a critical approach that interrogates sexual
normativities and orthodoxies]{.underline}]{.mark}. And it recognizes
sexuality as a non-essential or unfixed aspect of subjectivity. But to
state that subjectivity is unfixed is not to state that it is fluid and
capable of obliterating boundaries. Browne states that she does not see
'queer' as a 'simplistically appropriated identity category' (2006a:
888). Yet she does not repudiate identity politics and ponders what
constitutes queer subjectivities and queer spatialities. So, though not
a straightforward process, for Browne it is possible to live queer
lives. Even if we accept this proposition that queer is a thing that can
be possessed or animated by individuals, [we must call attention to the
fact that no individual that lives in the social world is free-floating
or disembodied]{.underline}. As Judith Halberstam argues, '[[postmodern
gender theory has largely been (wrongly) interpreted as both a
description of and a call for greater degrees of flexibility and
fluidity']{.underline}]{.mark} (2005: 19). [As are all binaries, the
[binary division of fluidity or rigidity is a fiction that is more
productively deconstructed than embraced.]{.mark}]{.underline} So while
I agree with Browne that queer and LGBT are not synonymous, [I question
the [analytical usefulness of defining queer as fluid and beyond
normativity]{.mark}. Such a move does not [reconfigure the mapping of
resistant/oppressive onto homosexuals/ heterosexuals. It merely
supplants the homosexuals in this equation with 'queers' and
dismisses]{.mark}]{.underline} Foucault's lesson [that '[where there is
power, there is resistance,]{.mark} and yet]{.underline}, or rather
consequently, [[this resistance is never in a position of exteriority in
relation to power']{.underline}]{.mark} (Foucault, 1978: 95).

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Queer Pessimism

#### The AFFs queer pessimism operationalizes nativeness and the state of nature in order to cohere death as queer. Reject the desire of biopolitical settler sovereignty to become native.

**Schotten, 2018** (C. Heike -- Associate Professor of Political Science
@ the University of Massachusetts-Boston, [Queer Terror: Life, Death,
and Desire in the Settler Colony]{.underline}, p. 49-61, shae)

THE FUTURE IS SETTLER COLONIAL Despite my emphasis so far on life and
survival, the production of \"death\" through the inauguration of
temporality is just as important as the constitution of life. After all,
if life only becomes recognizable as life retrospectively, the same can
and must be true about death. Thus, while the sovereign is consistently
presented as the beacon of peace in Leviathan, war and death are just as
much his creations as are peace and life. This is one, merely formal way
of substantiating the claim that [biopolitics is]{.underline}
simultaneously and [necessarily a necropolitics]{.underline}. However,
[what is also evident]{.underline} in Hobbes (but notably absent in
Edelman) [is the important qualification of this bio/necropolitics as
specifically colonial.]{.underline} Closer examination of the time/place
that is the state of nature makes clear that Hobbes\'s [[championing of
life is a celebration and protection]{.mark} only [of]{.mark} the lives
of those who are [\"civilized,]{.mark}\" a safeguarding that comes at
the necessary expense[, obliteration, transfer, removal, and
dispossession of \"savage\" others]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words,
[[\"life\" in biopolitical sovereignty is specifically settler life,
characterized as \"civilization,\" while\" death\" demarcates
\"savagery]{.mark},\" or all those who cannot or will not conform to
this particular political formation, as its foremost
threat]{.underline}. In other words, it is the specifically settler
character of \"life\" that explains the simultaneity and coincidence of
sovereignty\'s bio- and necropolitics. Returning once more to that
notorious state of nature, recall my claim that time cannot exist there.
Hobbes might potentially be seen as acknowledging this fact insofar as
he refers to the state of nature as not only a \"time\" but also a
\"condition,\" two terms he seems to use interchangeably throughout
chapter 13. For example, in the first sentence of the paragraph about
war, he writes that \"during the time men live without a common Power to
keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called
Warre.\"68 Later, entertaining objections to his arguments about the
state of nature, he muses, \"It may peradventure be thought, there was
never such a time, nor condition of warre as this.\" 69 He then further
complicates things by proceeding to conflate time and condition with
geographical location, noting immediately thereafter, \"and I believe it
was never generally so, over all the world: but there are many places,
where they live so now\"70 -- for example, \"the savage people in many
places of America.\"71 These ambiguous and confusing characterizations
of the state of nature nevertheless cohere around one feature that
unites them, which is their ultimately civilizationalist character.
First, as already discussed, if the state of nature is a time-an era,
say, or an epoch-it is simultaneously a moment that is completely
timeless, an existence lacking any dynamism or principle of change.
Indeed, although Hobbes famously characterizes life in the state of
nature as \"solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short,\"72 that last
adjective is simply unwarranted given that no time is possible there.
However rhetorically effective it may be, lodged at the end of a litany
of dreary adjectives, life in the state of nature cannot be
characterized as short any more than it can be characterized as long or
even average because, as Hobbes makes clear, temporality does not
pertain to it.73 However, if the state of nature is instead a condition,
then it is one of \"savagery,\" as Hobbes makes explicit. Bolstering the
view that the state of nature is a story about humanity\'s prehistory,
Hobbes here rehearses the colonialist trope of indigenous peoples as
European humanity\'s ancestors or premodern childhood. [Savagery is
therefore associated with stalled temporality, timelessness, and the
failure of forward movement or progress.]{.underline} Conclusively,
however, when referenced as geographical location, Hobbes materializes
the state of nature in \"America\" and the seventeenth-century European
notion of the New World, an uncharted territory ripe for exploration and
conquest. The specifications of the state of nature as premodern,
timeless, \"savage,\" and \"America\" make clear that the establishment
of the commonwealth imposes a distinction not simply between life and
death, peace and war, but also between progress and timelessness,
modernity and backwardness, civilization and savagery. Each of these
categorial pairs functions as a surrogate for the others; taken
together, they suggest the deep implication of categories of life and
death with colonization and conquest for European political theory.
[Once [sovereignty, civilization, and peace are established as the
domain of life, the state of nature, \"savagery,\" and war are
established as the domain of death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nichols writes,
[\"The \'savage\' of the Americas thus becomes the symbolic negative --
[the embodiment of the state of nature itself,]{.mark} and thus all
which is to be [avoided by]{.mark} civilized men living in [civil
(]{.mark}political[) society.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}74 The state of
nature is most concrete, in Hobbes\'s varying descriptions of it, as a
place-that is, \"America.\" Immediately after declaring this, however,
he concedes: But though there had never been any time, wherein
particular men were in a condition of warre against one another; yet in
all times, Kings, and Persons of Soveraigne authority, because of their
Independency, are in continuall jealousies, and in the state and posture
of Gladiators; having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on
one another; that is, their Forts, Garrisons, and Guns upon the
Frontiers of their Kingdomes; and continuall Spyes upon their
neighbours, which is a posture of War. But because they uphold thereby,
the Industry of their Subjects; there does not follow from it, that
misery, which accompanies the Liberty of particular men.75 Rescinding
his prior example of native North Americans, Hobbes concedes that there
never really was any such time or condition as this state of nature. Not
only are native peoples not in a state of nature, then, but also, and
quite literally, there is no state of nature because, as we have seen,
no time is possible there. Instead, Hobbes now claims, in \"all times,\"
the situation of international relations is like that of the state of
nature, because heads of state are in perpetual warfare with one
another. The state of nature, then, is neither a time nor a condition
nor a place but, rather, an allegory of interstate behavior. And yet,
even in this new global location, anarchy does not lead to the misery of
the state of nature Hobbes described earlier because, as he says,
sovereigns engage in foreign wars in the interest of securing their
domestic subjects (rather than their own personages, presumably). Thus
even as a metaphor the state of nature does not exist. It is a time that
is no time, a condition that cannot exist in its unconditionality, a
place that is nowhere, a representation of the unrepresentable.76
Hobbes\'s vacillation, confusion, and ultimate retraction of any
concrete examples of the state of nature can be productively deciphered
by linking it to theories of settler colonialism, on the one hand, and
Edelman\'s critique of futurism, on the other. Regarding the first,
Lorenzo Veracini has argued that [[settler colonialism is distinct from
other types of colonialism insofar as its seeks consistently to erase
itself as settler colonial]{.underline},]{.mark} to "supersede the
conditions of its operation.\"77 Following Patrick Wolfe\'s argument
that [settler colonialism [pursues a "logic of elimination\" whereby
settlers seek to replace the natives and indigenize
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} post facto,78 Veracini argues that
because it aims at the elimination of the native, settler colonialism
necessarily aims at its own elimination: The successful settler colonies
\"tame\" a variety of wildernesses, end up establishing independent
nations, effectively repress, co-opt, and extinguish indigenous
alterities, and productively manage ethnic diversity. By the end of this
trajectory, they claim to be no longer settler colonial (they are
putatively \"settled\" and \"postcolonial\"-except that unsettling
anxieties remain, and references to a postcolonial condition appear
hollow as soon as indigenous disadvantage is taken into account).
Settler colonialism thus covers its tracks and operates towards its
self-supersession (this is why, paradoxically, settler colonialism is
most recognizable when it is most imperfect-say, 1950s Kenya or 1970s
Zimbabwe-and least visible in the settler cities).79 [The truly
["successful\" settler colonial project]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other
words, [[would manage to efface the native entirely, whether through
genocide or assimilation or]{.underline}]{.mark} some other form of
disappearance-more recently, via a politics of
[[recognition]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Glen Coulthard has argued.80 One
way this happens is through [the [narration of
settlement]{.mark}]{.underline} itself, which [[disappears the native
through discourses of nonexistence, invisibility, or terra
nullius]{.underline}]{.mark}.81 In Hobbes, this emerges as his inability
to definitively locate or circumscribe the state of nature. This is
consistent with the originary imaginings of all settler polities. As
Veracini observes, "It is not a coincidence that the cultural traditions
of the settler polities often focus on real or imaginary locales
putatively epitomising specific national attributes: the \'outback,\'
the \'backblocks,\' and, most famously, the \'frontier.\' Generally
speaking, these are not specific locations, and their most important
characteristic is to be always somewhere else."82 The state of nature is
one such highly abstract geographical imagining and, as we have seen,
Hobbes displaces it from a time to a condition to a place to a metaphor,
eventually determining that it never existed at all, even as a
hermeneutic. Of course, regardless of how Hobbes defines or determines
the \"state of nature,\" the fact of the matter is that neither
settlement nor indigenous people are, in fact, \"elsewhere,\" but
ever-present facts of the here and now.83 Yet Veracini argues that
[[settler colonialism must]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless
[[constantly imagine native peoples as elsewhere, an act of symbolic
displacement that effaces]{.mark} the actual existence of [native
peoples]{.mark} and erases them even in their existence]{.underline}: If
the indigene is fundamental to the settler relation, where the indigene
is located does matter. Thus, the \"real\" indigence is always somewhere
else; that is why, to play on Philip J. Deloria\'s insight, he is always
\"unexpected\" in actual places. Likewise, indigenous peoples are
generally not seen in the settler cities, the places where the settlers
live. Examples abound; the main point is that discursive devices aimed
at redirecting attention away from emplaced settler-indigenous
relationships are indeed many. 84 Veracini suggests that all forms of
indigenous removal can be characterized as different versions of
\"transfer,\" which he argues is foundational to the settler colonial
project.85 Regardless of whether we call it transfer or elimination,
however, unless and until it is accomplished, settler states engage in
all sorts of contortions, both political and ideological, to obscure the
native in order to naturalize conquest. In short, disappearance of the
land\'s indigenous inhabitants and subsequent attempts to \"indigenize\"
settlers are the means by which land expropriation is simultaneously
naturalized and obscured. Veracini presents [this iterative, imaginary
displacement]{.underline} either as conceptually embedded in the
definition of settler colonialism or else [as a kind of bad faith on the
settlers\' part, potentially [implying that a guilty conscience gives
rise to a host of defense mechanisms to ward off]{.mark} (knowledge of)
[conquest]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other contexts, political theorists
have considered that such recursive movement is definitive of
sovereignty itself, which can establish the law only via a prior,
extralegal, and illegitimate assertion of force. Yet the recursive
ideological contortions of settler sovereignty are neither the result of
guilt nor somehow intrinsic to its conceptual definitions. Robert
Nichols has already persuasively argued that [[the recursive character
of settlement is a means of facilitating dispossession,]{.mark} denying
the existence of indigenous peoples, and disregarding their claims to
land and sovereignty]{.underline}.86 So the materiality of this
operation is clear. Yet what to make of the specifically ideological
character of this recursivity? What explains the reiterative rationales
for conquest that attempt to erase it as conquest at all? Borrowing from
Edelman, one might say that while [these ideological
contortions]{.underline} are fundamental to settler colonialism, they
are also fundamental to any futurist narrativization of \"life.\" In
other words, the reason why Hobbes cannot definitively locate or
circumscribe the state of nature is the same the reason why the settler
state seeks ideologically to naturalize settlers as native to the lands
they have conquered. It is because, to use Edelman\'s vocabulary, both
[are [futurist narrativizations of the
drive]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} his Lacanian term for [that [aspect
of human existence that resists any temporal or symbolic
determination]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Hobbes talks about this in
terms of \"endeavor.\" But Edelman\'s drive/Hobbes\'s endeavor is what
in fact defines the unending present that is the time/condition/place of
the state of nature; indeed, Hobbes\'s state of nature is effectively an
attempt at a representation of this drive/endeavor, which both thinkers
are clear is unrepresentable. For, while Hobbes defines the motion of
human life in terms of desire and aversion, these terms are only
appropriate monikers for motion once it becomes perceptible. Before it
is manifest in the form of desire, it exists as \"small beginnings of
Motion, within the body of man, before they appear in walking, speaking,
striking, and other visible actions.\"87 In other words, [it is only
once endeavor takes an object and becomes motion toward something that
it becomes simultaneously apprehensible and also properly called
desire,]{.underline} while endeavor away from an object \"is generally
called AVERSION.\"88 [This [drive]{.mark}]{.underline}/endeavor [[is not
only prior to or outside of representation, but it also has no intrinsic
justification]{.mark}, much less any clear or uncontroversial narrative
articulation.]{.underline} It simply is. Thus any imposition of terms
onto it -- in order to render it apprehensible, coherent, or legible --
is precisely that, an imposition, and thus an explicitly ideological
move that serves a particular political agenda. For Edelman, this act of
transforming the otherwise unsignifiable endeavor of human existence
into \"the fictive form of a narrative\" 89 is the very definition of
politics. As he says, \"[[politics is a name for the temporalization of
desire, for its translation into a narrative, for its teleological
determination]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"90 This definition of politics
explains his insistence that politics is necessarily \"conservative\" --
because \"it works to affirm a structure, to authenticate a social
order\"91 in its very existence -- and also destined to fail. For
Edelman, [[futurism perpetuates \"the fantasy of meaning\'s eventual
realization,\"]{.mark} a realization that is by definition impossible
insofar as endeavor itself has no intrinsic meaning and [\"the future\"
as its justification is always only ever to come.]{.mark} As the future,
it is just out of reach]{.underline}, ever beyond our grasp, "an always
about-to-be-realized identity.\"92 [Rather than confront its own,
necessary impossibility]{.underline}, Edelman argues that [[futurism
instead generates scapegoats to distract]{.underline}]{.mark} from and
take the fall for it, people or places or events that become the
displaced, [[villainized obstacles to futurism\'s]{.mark} otherwise
successful [realization]{.mark}]{.underline}. His [name for these
scapegoats is "queer.\"]{.underline} This queerness, also
unrepresentable because it is another name for the drive/endeavor that
politics (that is, narrativization) impossibly seeks to domesticate and
resolve, takes on the figure of whatever or whoever threatens the
disarticulation of the self and social order, which are ideologically
presumed to be the prepolitical premises of our existence. [This futile
and fantasmatic futurism is]{.underline} a surprisingly apt
characterization of [the settler state]{.underline}, the full
realization of which would, as Veracini notes, effect its erasure.
[[Settler colonies resort to]{.underline}]{.mark} any number of
[[destructive forms of managing futurism\'s
failings]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [from transfer and removal to
outright extermination through war, massacre, starvation, and
disease.]{.underline} (There are also a multitude of cultural forms of
indigenous "transfer,\" whether it be the usage of indigenous peoples as
sports team mascots, [the fetishization of indigenous religious and
spiritual practices in order to deny Indianness to Indians while
claiming it for settlers, or the racialization of Indians into minority
populations]{.underline}.) Yet this anxious, reiterative activity is
wholly predictable from an Edelmanian perspective and ineliminable from
the structure of settler sovereignty, because [[the futurist narration
of the drive]{.underline}]{.mark}/endeavor [[has rendered settlers
beholden to an unsustainable temporality that must produce queerness or
death in order to continue to produce meaning, survival, and
civilization]{.mark} for itself. [Settler sovereignty
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words, [[do without the
death-native it brings into being; **the native as death must exist in
order to purchase life and survival for the settler and is the figure
of**]{.mark} **[queerness in this futurist
scheme]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} \"Queerness\" in Hobbes is
represented, figured, or embodied by those who fail to conform to the
lineaments of rationality that his particular sovereign formation takes
for granted-in this case, the rational character of life and its value.
Hobbes calls these figures \"absurd\" rather than queer, but the meaning
is the same. The queer or absurd are those who do not seek to preserve
themselves or flee death. Such figures barely show up in this text and
are largely incomprehensible in his schema. They both instantiate death
and invite it as the only proper response to their incomprehensible and
insupportable rejection of the social order. For example, any remaining
holdouts in the state of nature unwilling to join a majority decision to
create a commonwealth must be forced to go along with them \"or be left
in the condition of warre he was in before; wherein he might without
injustice be destroyed by any man whatsoever.\"93 This is the
rationalization of conquest, however abstract, unmarked, or \"rational\"
it may seem to be. For, as has become clear, those who do not recognize
the value of life are not simply absurd or irrational; they are
specifically those \"savage\" or precivilizational people(s) who have no
concept of time or established system of governance. Of course, [[the
\"savage\" as deathly threat has been produced precisely as that threat
by the settler polity itself,]{.mark} which [can only sustain itself via
this anxious, recursive, and impossible-to-resolve dynamic of producing
and eliminating the enemy]{.mark} of its own order[,]{.mark} the enemy
that it requires if it is to be an order at all and yet that it must
eliminate if it is to \"overcome\" what it is]{.underline}. As Alyosha
Goldstein observes, \"United States colonialism is a continuously
failing-or at least a perpetually incomplete-project that labors to find
a workable means of resolution to sustain its logic of possession and
inevitability by disavowing the ongoing contestation with which it is
confronted and violent displacement that it demands.\"94 [This constant
aspiration toward an [unrealizable future is a promise bought at the
expense of effacing the founding violence that]{.mark} is the
institution of [settler sovereignty]{.mark} itself.]{.underline} Because
that foundation is impossible to leave behind, because the native has
not been finally eliminated once and for all, because the subjects of
the commonwealth remain [[settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}, they cannot
rest. They [[cannot rest until the last trace of the native has been
eliminated]{.mark}, such that settlement can become a truly legitimate
commonwealth founded on the basis of a free and equal social contract of
its \"native\" citizens.]{.underline} [In the face of the impossibility
of this achievement]{.underline}, however, [they must find other outlets
for their anxious desire. This is how and why the settler colonial
foundation of biopolitical sovereignty transforms itself into an
expansionist, imperial security state that finds new enemies abroad, new
obstacles to its endless expansion, thereby solving]{.underline} (albeit
only ever [temporarily and incompletely) the problem of futurist failure
that constituted settlement to begin with]{.underline}. This
transformation is immediately apparent in Hobbes\'s astute psychology of
the life of futurist desire. Regarding desire, Hobbes claims that one
seeks not simply \"enjoyment\" in the present or \"to enjoy once onely,
and for one instant of time.\" Rather, one seeks \'\'to assure for ever,
the way of his future desire.\"95 [If the [nature of desire is such that
we seek to assure satisfaction forever, indefinitely into the future,
then life/desire is inevitably bound up with anxiety]{.mark}, on the one
hand, [and power-seeking,]{.mark} on the other. Perpetually uncertain
about the prospects of successfully getting what we want, we must
continually seek to enlarge our power in order to secure the objects of
our desire]{.underline}. It is important to note that this
ever-expanding sphere of influence is not the result of a snowballing or
addictive sort of pleasure-seeking behavior, nor is it due to some
essential will to power at the heart of human nature. It is, rather,
simply what is required in order to preserve the status quo: \'\'It is
not alwayes that a man hopes for a more intensive delight, than he has
already attained to; or that he cannot be content with a moderate power:
but because he cannot assure the power and means to live well, which he
hath present, without the acquisition of more.\"96 Mere maintenance of
the present, in other words, requires accumulation, undertaken in
perpetual reference to an uncertain future. The successful maintenance
of an indefinite present is, for Hobbes, the content of human happiness:
\"Continuall successe in obtaining those things which a man from time to
time desireth, that is to say, continuall prospering, is that men call
Felicity.\"97 Such felicity is impossible, of course, as Hobbes concedes
in the very next sentence: \"I mean the Felicity of this life. For there
is no such thing as perpetuall Tranquillity of mind, while we live here;
because Life itself is but Motion, and can never be without Desire, nor
without Peare, no more than without Sense.\"98 Hobbes acknowledges, in
other words, that, based on his own futurist accounting of life/desire
and in fact precisely because of it, \"happiness\" (that is, getting
what you want) is impossible. Even supposing one were able to secure the
requisite amount of power necessary to maintain the status quo, such an
(impossible) achievement would mean that our desire would be satisfied,
and therefore extinguished. It would mean, in other words, no longer
being alive, since \"to have no desire is to be dead.\"99 As he
explains, To which we are to consider, that the Felicity of this life,
consisteth not in the repose of a mind satisfied. For there is no such
Finis ultimus, (utmost ayme,) nor Summum Bon um, (greatest Good,) as is
spoken of in the Books of the old Morall Philosophers. Nor can a man any
more live, whose Desires are at an end, than he, whose Senses and
Imaginations are at a stand. Felicity is a continuall progress of the
desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being
still but the way to the later.100 Suggesting that (attainment of) the
highest good of Aristotelian ethics is itself a kind of stasis or death,
Hobbes plainly rejects the idea that the endless motion that
characterizes human life could come to a halt in some fashion that does
not entail death. Understood psychologically, he is making clear that
human happiness-the only kind available to us in "this life\" -means
never actually being satisfied. The perpetuity of enjoyment at which
desire aims is a consumption that is never, can never fully be (allowed
to be) complete(d). Hobbes\'s specifically futurist and expansionist
understanding of desire makes clear that, rather than confront the
impossibility of security, happiness, and immortality, he instead offers
the commonwealth and an everexpanding pursuit of power as a substitutive
satisfaction. In other words, he both institutes life and pushes it
forward via a futurist narrativization of endeavor into an insatiable,
accumulative desire. Rather than face the founding violence that brought
peace and \"life itself\" into being, Hobbes instead naturalizes this
act by declaring it to be \"a generall inclination of all mankind\" to
engage in \"a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power after power, that
ceaseth onely in Death.\"101 Yet [[while desire may push us ever
forward, ever beyond the initial moments of settlement, it cannot erase
that settlement or relieve settler sovereignty of the burden of
conquest.]{.mark} This is]{.underline} neither because of settler
colonialism\'s theoretical definition nor because settlers secretly feel
guilty about conquest, but rather [because of the impossibility of
fulfilling futurism\'s fantastical promises. [Empire functions
as]{.mark} a kind of substitutive [satisfaction to compensate for the
failure of settler sovereignty to]{.mark} finally and fully [exterminate
indigenous peoples.]{.mark} The pleasures of endless imperial
expansion-the restless desire of \"power after power\" in an attempt to
secure the future, once and for all-relieve the burden of the failed
\"completion\" of the settler colonial project and the impossible
promise of happiness. [**Empire is thus the settler impulse turned
outward**.]{.mark} It is a salve for settlement in its promise of an
impossible, if now-externalized, future happiness and
security]{.underline}.102 Built into Hobbes\'s understanding of desire,
then (and, therefore, the Commonwealth), is the failed teleology of
futurism, which, as Edelman instructs, is fundamentally and futilely
political. The reason the commonwealth cannot alleviate the anxiety that
runs apace with desire is because it cannot eliminate the foundations of
its existence and the basis of its regime: on the one hand, indigenous
removal and dispossession; on the other, the futurist constitution of
\"life\" and/as desire. Indigenous removal and dispossession are
accomplished, therefore, not only via the exertion of violence,
domination, war, famine, genocide, and disease, but also via a
specifically ideological imposition of the meaning of \"life\" and\"
death\" that requires an indigenous removal and dispossession that it
cannot accomplish without killing itself. [This intractable dilemma
explains the transformation of settler societies into security states,
which reformulates [the indigenous threat of \"savagery\" and death into
external, terroristic opponents of its \"way of
life.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} As Jodi Byrd observes, [[\"Indianness
becomes a site through which U.S. empire orients and replicates itself
by transforming those to be colonized into \'Indians\' through continual
reiterations of pioneer logics]{.mark},]{.underline} whether in the
Pacific, the Caribbean, or the Middle East.\"103
[[Empire]{.underline}]{.mark}, in other words, [[relocates the state of
nature from the domain of the indigenous \"savage\" to the
\"wilderness\" abroad,]{.mark} itself in need of taming and civilizing
if life and its value are to be satisfactorily protected.]{.underline}
Twenty-first-century [empire is thus legible]{.underline}, as Byrd and
others have argued, [as an outgrowth of the settlement of the United
States and a contemporary episode of its ongoing
structure]{.underline}.104 Stephen Silliman has documented the US
military\'s usage of \"Indian country\" to describe Iraq and Afghanistan
in the War on Terror. While the Revolutionary War or Civil War possess
just as much \"resonance in the psyche of the United States as wars for
freedom, unity, and democracy,\" nevertheless \"soldiers in the Middle
East draw on the \'Indian wars\' of the 19th century to inform their
daily experiences in combat.\"105 Silliman argues that \'\'The efficacy
of this metaphor relies not in the accuracy of the historical or
cultural details \... but on the believability and acceptability of them
as part of a narrative of conquest and nation building.\"106 The
\"Indian country\" characterization serves, in other words, to
naturalize the \"success\" of the conquest of North America by casting
contemporary US empire as an inevitably victorious, if now-worldwide,
battle against \'\'savagery,\" this time in the form of lslam and
\'\'terrorism.\" Of George W. Bush\'s expressed desire to \"smoke\"
Osama Bin Laden \'\'out of his cave,\" for example, Alex Lubin writes,
The invocation of the Western drama of settler colonialism has always
animated American thinking about and activity in the Middle East, and
Bush is merely tapping into a well of affective politics that links the
United States to the Middle East as well as provides support for
increased surveillance and the suspension of rights domestically. Yet,
in the contemporary era of neoliberal globalization, the United States\'
comparative rendering of the Middle East through its own settler
colonial past has been multiplied and transformed into a \"global war on
terror.\" That is, the United States\' unparalleled superpower status
enables it to universalize and globalize its comparative politics into a
global \"clash of civilizations.\"107 Simultaneously, then, [as the
[\"terrorist\" obstacles to empire become projected versions of Indians,
Indians become retroactively legible as the first or foundational
examples of \'\'terrorism]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Of the Declaration of
Independence, for example, which complains that King George \"has
endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless
Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions,\" Byrd observes, The
non-discriminating, proto-inclusive [\"[merciless Indian Savage\" stands
as the terrorist, externalized from \"our frontiers,\"]{.mark} and
functions as abjected horror through whom civilization is articulated
oppositionally]{.underline}. This non-recuperative category, a
derealization of the Other, serves as a paranoid foundation for what
Jasbir K. Puar defines in Terrorist Assemblages as Islamic
\"monster-terrorist-fags,\" the affectively produced and queered West
Asian (including South Asian, Arab American, and Muslim) body that is
targeted for surveillance and destruction by U.S. patriotic
pathology.108 The \"terrorist\" of today, the contemporary obstacle to
empire, is the native of an alleged "yesterday,\" the archaic obstacle
to settlement. [Whether in the domain of conquest or
empire]{.underline}, however, [[the failed futurism of settler colonial
sovereignty produces abjected queer repositories of death that stand as
a threat to the civilized life of the settler]{.mark}
society[.]{.mark}]{.underline}109 Their interconnection is crucial; the
logic that connects them continuous. Unsurprisingly, then, Hobbes\'s
political theory serves as a justification for what it claimed only to
describe. While an unmarked self-preservation and fear of death have
typically been taken to be the natural and logical preconditions of the
sovereign politics Hobbes institutes in Leviathan, an Edelmanian
approach to this text reveals them to be the premier values settler
sovereignty ideologically seeks retroactively to (re)produce and uphold.
What this means, then, is that Hobbes\'s entire state of nature story is
an anachronism. Like all origin stories, it is fundamentally ideological
and offered primarily in order to legitimate an already-existing
political order and the political commitment of its storyteller.110 The
particular agenda being naturalized in Hobbes\'s biopolitical story of
the state of nature is settler conquest, and its futurist determination
is the reason why he cannot decide when and where it is, and also why
settler colonial societies seek constantly to erase themselves as
settler societies. m [[The insecurity lodged at the heart of settler
colonialism\'s futurist desire renders satisfaction impossible,]{.mark}
an impossibility that remains unacknowledged and is instead [foisted
onto those "savages" who refuse]{.mark} collaboration with [its
ideological ruses]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Leviathan is thus a
settler colonial text par excellence. Like Agamben in this regard, it is
a rationalization of empire that ignores all those queered by its
machinations. Unlike Agamben, however, it makes explicit the connection
between the biopolitics of settler colonialism and that of contemporary
empire, revealing the futurist temporality that links them together and
renders them continuous projects.

#### Edleman is correct that the white child should not be the center of society but incorrect about futurity. The investment of no future is just a rehashing of settler colonial tactics. Any form of decolonization should grapple with the histories and futures of indigenous sovereignty and ways of knowing.

Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and
Heteropatriarchy, Feminist Formations, Vol. 25 No. 1, Spring)

[As our discussions of Indigenous epistemologies about land and
sovereignty have demonstrated[, recognizing that Indigenous sovereignty
struggles are gendered frequently requires revising conventional
concepts of sovereignty]{.mark}, decolonization, and social change
altogether]{.underline}. For us, [the real promise of [Native feminist
theories]{.mark} lies precisely in the ways that, along with recognizing
the very real challenges that Indigenous peoples face daily, these
theories are simultaneously constructing what Smith]{.underline} (2008b)
[[compellingly describes as "the history of the future of sovereignty,
what sovereignty could mean for Native peoples]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(257). [By directing our attention toward the beautifully evocative
"history of the future of sovereignty[," she is reframing futurity---a
concept important to a number of disciplines, including queer studies
and performance studies---with Indigenous peoples at the
center]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, Smith demonstrates that one of the
most radical and necessary moves toward decolonization requires
imagining and enacting a future for Indigenous peoples---a future based
on terms of their own making. [In a GLQ special issue titled "Sexuality,
Nationality, Indigeneity," Smith]{.underline} (2010) [specifically
elaborates on the concept of futurity as theorized by]{.underline} queer
theorist Lee [Edelman.]{.underline} She notes that Edelman's book No
Future forwards a useful critique of the figure of "the Child" as the
symbol of society's reproductive future and an excuse for justifying the
reproduction of the existing social order (46). Yet, Smith also
demonstrates that [refusing to participate in the reproduction of
society by declining to reproduce the Child is a mode of radical
activism that is only possible, desirable, and otherwise "thinkable" for
certain economically privileged white queers.]{.underline} She argues
that [[\[a\]n indigenous critique must question the value of "no future"
in the context of genocide, where Native peoples have already been
determined by settler colonialism to have no future]{.mark}. If the goal
of queerness is to challenge the reproduction of the social order, then
the Native child may already be queered.]{.underline} [For instance,
Colonel]{.underline} John [Chivington]{.underline}, the leader of the
famous massacre at Sand Creek, [charged his followers to not only kill
Native adults but to mutilate their reproductive organs and to kill
their children because "nits make lice."]{.underline} In this context,
[the Native Child is not the guarantor of the reproductive future of
white supremacy; it is the nit that undoes it]{.underline}. (48)
[Smith's critique exposes the ways that radical queer theory can
participate in the "ascendancy of whiteness" even when it disavows
it---in Edelman's case, because he fails to acknowledge or consider the
ways that having children is a privilege that has been historically
denied to many nonwhite and nonaffluent people. Given the pervasive
violence perpetuated on Indigenous peoples through campaigns focused on
managing Indigenous reproduction and childrearing]{.underline} (from
boarding schools to eugenics and forced sterilization[), [proposing to
invest in "no future" seems not only irrelevant to Indigenous peoples,
but a rehashing of previous settler colonial
tactics.]{.mark}]{.underline} Smith's critique is meant to be a
generative one, insisting on making real connections between Native and
queer studies for the future of both fields and all of the peoples these
fields engage. She further argues that ["while both 'tradition' and 'the
future' must be critically engaged, it does not follow that they can be
dismissed]{.underline}" (ibid.). [We also place importance on ideas of
Indigenous futures, which are always also interlaced with Indigenous
traditions, histories, and even ghosts, in our own theories of
decolonization]{.underline}. Eve Tuck (2009) has written about
desire-based research as a key counterpoint to damage-centered research
frameworks, which too often present [Indigenous peoples as broken,
arguing that "\[d\]esire is involved with the not yet and, at times, the
not anymore]{.underline}. . . . [Desire is about longing, about a
present that is enriched by both the past and the future]{.underline}"
(417). Angie Morrill (forthcoming) further writes that ["\[g\]hosts
haunt the future with expectations," noting that we share desires with
ghosts, therefore Native desire is a kind of time machine]{.underline}.
For Maile Arvin (forthcoming), [[decolonization involves
regeneration,]{.mark} which she defines as "desires and practices
oriented by transforming settler colonial dispossession [and
recreating]{.mark} a people-possessed]{.underline} (rather than an
individually self-possessed) [[Indigenous future]{.mark}."]{.underline}
In each of our approaches toward decolonization, we do not intend to
recommend to our readers one proper set of decolonial practices, but
rather create spaces in which decolonization can be deeply considered
and experimented with in the specific contexts of different places.
Overall, [with this challenge to recognize Indigenous ways of knowing,
we insist that it is most important to acknowledge Indigenous concepts
and epistemologies as complex, knowledgeable, and full of both history
and desire[. Engaging Indigenous epistemologies]{.mark}, without
appropriating them or viewing them merely as a mystical metaphor[, is a
method of decolonization that could play a significant role in creating
a future for Indigenous peoples and Indigenous ways of
knowing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The settler colonial project requires the disappearance or assimilation of the Native, who produces Settler anxieties that confound national belonging -- this is an ongoing genocide that also exists in premature moves to reconciliation and the desire to not have to deal with the Indian problem anymore.

Recently in a symposium on the significance of Liberal Arts education in
the United States, Eve presented an argument that [**Liberal** **Arts
education has historically excluded any attention to or analysis of
settler colonialism.**]{.underline} **[This, Eve posited, makes Liberal
Arts education complicit in the project of settler colonialism and, more
so, has rendered the truer project of Liberal Arts education something
like trying to make the settler indigenous to the land he
occupies.]{.underline}** The attendees were titillated by this idea,
nodding and murmuring in approval and it was then that Eve realized that
she was trying to say something incommensurable with what they expected
her to say. She was completely misunderstood. **[Many in the audience
heard this observation: that the work of Liberal Arts education is in
part to teach settlers to be indigenous, as something admirable,
worthwhile, something wholesome, not as a problematic point of evidence
about the reach of the settler colonial erasure.]{.underline}** Philip
Deloria (1998) explores how and why the settler wants to be made
indigenous, even if only through disguise, or other forms of playing
Indian. **[[Playing Indian is a powerful U.S. pastime]{.mark}, from the
Boston Tea Party, to fraternal organizations, to new age trends, to even
those aforementioned Native print underwear.]{.underline}** Deloria
maintains that, "From the colonial period to the present, the Indian has
skulked in and out of the most important stories various Americans have
told about themselves" (p. 5). **[[The indeterminacy of American
identities stems]{.mark}, in part, [from the nation's inability to deal
with Indian people.]{.mark} Americans wanted to feel a natural affinity
with the continent, and it was Indians who could teach them such
aboriginal closeness.]{.underline}** **[Yet, in [order to control the
landscape they had to destroy the original
inhabitants.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Deloria, 1998, p.5) L. Frank Baum
(author of The Wizard of Oz) famously asserted in 1890 that the safety
of white settlers was only guaranteed by the "total annihilation of the
few remaining Indians" (as quoted in Hastings, 2007). D.H. Lawrence,
reading James Fenimore Cooper (discussed at length later in this
article), Nathaniel Hawthorne, Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, Henry
David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman and others for his Studies
in Classic American Literature (1924), describes Americans' fascination
with Indigeneity as one of simultaneous desire and repulsion (Deloria,
1998). **["No place," Lawrence observed, "exerts its full influence upon
a newcomer until the old inhabitant is dead or absorbed."]{.underline}**
Lawrence argued that in order to meet the "demon of the continent" head
on and this finalize the "unexpressed spirit of America," white
Americans needed either to destroy Indians of assimilate them into a
white American world\...both aimed at making Indians vanish from the
landscape. (Lawrence, as quoted in Deloria, 1998, p. 4).
**[[Everything]{.mark} [within]{.mark} a [settler co]{.mark}l[onial
society strains to destroy or assimilate the Native in order to
disappear them]{.mark} from the land [-]{.mark} this is how a [society
can have multiple]{.mark} simultaneous and [conflicting messages]{.mark}
about Indigenous peoples, [such as all Indians are dead, located in
faraway reservations, that contemporary Indigenous people are less
indigenous]{.mark} than prior generations, [and that all Americans are a
"little bit Indian."]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[These [desires to
erase]{.mark} - to let time do its thing and wait for the older form of
living to die out, [or]{.mark} to even help speed things along
([euthanize]{.mark}) because the death of pre-modern ways of life is
thought to be inevitable - these [are]{.mark} all [desires for]{.mark}
another kind of [resolve to the colonial situation, resolved through the
absolute and total destruction or assimilation of original
inhabitants.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Numerous scholars have observed that
**[[Indigeneity prompts]{.mark} multiple forms of [settler
anxiety]{.mark}, even if only [because the presence of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} - who make a priori claims to land and ways of being -
[is]{.mark} [a]{.mark} constant [reminder that the settler colonial
project is incomplete]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Fanon, 1963; Vine Deloria,
1988; Grande, 2004; Bruyneel, 2007). The easy adoption of decolonization
as a metaphor (and nothing else) is a form of this anxiety, because it
is a premature attempt at reconciliation. **[[The absorption of
decolonization by settler social justice frameworks is one way the
settler]{.mark}, disturbed by her own settler status, [tries to]{.mark}
escape or [contain]{.mark} the [unbearable]{.mark} searchlight of

of the imbrication of settler colonialism with [transnationalist,

themes that challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors
broadly assembled into three areas: Transnational or Third World
decolonizations, Abolition, and Critical Space-Place Pedagogies. For
each of these areas, we offer entry points into the literature -
beginning a sort of bibliography of incommensurability. Third world
decolonizations **[The anti-colonial turn towards the transnational can
sometimes involve ignoring the settler colonial context where one
resides and how that inhabitation is implicated in settler colonialism,
in order to establish "global" solidarities that presumably suffer fewer
complicities and complications.]{.underline}** This deliberate
not-seeing is morally convenient but avoids an important feature of the
aforementioned selective collapsibility of settler colonial-nations
states. Expressions such as "the Global South within the Global North"
and "the Third World in the First World" neglect the Four Directions via
a Flat Earth perspective and ambiguate First Nations with Third World
migrants. **[For people writing on Third World decolonizations, but who
do so upon Native land, we invite you to consider the permanent settler
war as the theater for all imperial wars]{.underline}**: ● the
Orientalism of Indigenous Americans (Berger, 2004; Marez, 2007) ●
discovery, invasion, occupation, and Commons as the claims of settler
sovereignty (Ford, 2010) ● heteropatriarchy as the imposition of settler
sexuality (Morgensen, 2011) ● citizenship as coercive and forced
assimilation into the white settler normative (Bruyneel, 2004;
Somerville, 2010) ● religion as covenant for settler nation-state (A.J.
Barker, 2009; Maldonado-Torres, 2008) ● the frontier as the first and
always the site of invasion and war (Byrd, 2011), ● U.S. imperialism as
the expansion of settler colonialism (ibid) ● Asian settler colonialism
(Fujikane, 2012; Fujikane, & Okamura, 2008, Saranillio, 2010a, 2010b) ●
the frontier as the language of 'progress' and discovery
(Maldonado-Torres, 2008) ● rape as settler colonial structure (Deer,
2009; 2010) ● the discourse of terrorism as the terror of Native
retribution (Tuck & Ree, forthcoming) ● Native Feminisms as
incommensurable with other feminisms (Arvin, Tuck, Morrill, forthcoming;
Goeman & Denetdale, 2009). Abolition **[The abolition of slavery often
presumes the expansion of settlers who own Native land and life via
inclusion of emancipated slaves and prisoners into the settler
nation-state.]{.underline}** As we have noted, it is no accident that
the U.S. government promised 40 acres of Indian land as reparations for
plantation slavery. Likewise, indentured European laborers were often
awarded tracts of 'unsettled' Indigenous land as payment at the end of
their service (McCoy, forthcoming). **[Communal ownership of land has
figured centrally in various movements for autonomous, self-determined
communities. "The land belongs to those who work it," disturbingly
parrots Lockean justifications for seizing Native land as property,
'earned' through one's labor in clearing and cultivating 'virgin'
land.]{.underline}** For writers on the prison industrial complex,
il/legality, and other forms of slavery, we urge you to consider how
enslavement is a twofold procedure: removal from land and the creation
of property (land and bodies). **[Thus, abolition is likewise twofold,
requiring the repatriation of land and the abolition of property (land
and bodies).]{.underline}** Abolition means self-possession but not
object-possession, repatriation but not reparation: ● "The animals of
the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any
more than black people were made for white, or women created for men"
(Alice Walker, describing the work of Marjorie Spiegel, in the in the
preface to Spigel's 1988 book, The Dreaded Comparison). ●
Enslavement/removal of Native Americans (Gallay, 2009) ● Slaves who
become slave-owners, savagery as enslavability, chattel slavery as a
sign of civilization (Gallay, 2009) ● Black fugitivity, undercommons,
and radical dispossession (Moten, 2008; Moten & Harney, 2004; Moten &
Harney, 2010) ● Incarceration as a settler colonialism strategy of land
dispossession (Ross, 1998; Watson, 2007) ● Native land and Native people
as co-constituitive (Meyer, 2008; Kawagley, 2010) Critical pedagogies
The many critical pedagogies that engage emancipatory education, place
based education, environmental education, critical multiculturalism, and
urban education often position land as public Commons or seek
commonalities between struggles. Although we believe that "we must be
fluent" in each other's stories and struggles (paraphrasing Alexander,
2002, p.91), we detect precisely this lack of fluency in land and
Indigenous sovereignty. Yupiaq scholar, Oscar Kawagley's assertion, "We
know that Mother Nature has a culture, and it is a Native culture"
(2010, p. xiii), directs us to think through land as "more than a site
upon which humans make history or as a location that accumulates
history" (Goeman, 2008, p.24). The forthcoming special issue in
Environmental Education Research, "Land Education: Indigenous,
postcolonial, and decolonizing perspectives on place and environmental
education research" might be a good starting point to consider the
incommensurability of place-based, environmentalist, urban pedagogies
with land education. ● The urban as Indigenous (Bang, 2009; Belin, 1999;

colonialism fuels imperialism all around the globe.]{.underline}** Oil

Settler sovereignty over these very pieces of earth, air, and water is
what makes possible these imperialisms. The same yellow pollen in the
water of the Laguna Pueblo reservation in New Mexico, Leslie Marmon
Silko reminds us, is the same uranium that annihilated over 200,000
strangers in 2 flashes. The same yellow pollen that poisons the land
from where it came. Used in the same war that took a generation of young
Pueblo men. Through the voice of her character Betonie, Silko writes,
"Thirty thousand years ago they were not strangers. You saw what the
evil had done; you saw the witchery ranging as wide as the world\"
(Silko, 1982, p. 174). In Tucson, Arizona, where Silko lives, her books
are now banned in schools. Only curricular materials affirming the
settler innocence, ingenuity, and right to America may be taught. In
"No", her response to the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq,
Mvskoke/Creek poet Joy Harjo (2004) writes, "Yes, that was me you saw
shaking with bravery, with a government issued rifle on my back. I'm
sorry I could not greet you, as you deserved, my relative." Don't Native
Americans participate in greater rates in the military? asks the
young-ish man from Viet Nam. **["Indian Country" was/is the term used in
Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq by the U.S. military for 'enemy
territory'.]{.underline}** The first Black American President said
without blinking, "There was a point before folks had left, before we
had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to
base, where they said Geronimo has been killed, and Geronimo was the
code name for bin Laden." Elmer Pratt, Black Panther leader, falsely
imprisoned for 27 years, was a Vietnam Veteran, was nicknamed
'Geronimo'. Geronimo is settler nickname for the Bedonkohe Apache
warrior who fought Mexican and then U.S. expansion into Apache tribal
lands. The Colt .45 was perfected to kill Indigenous people during the
'liberation' of what became the Philippines, but it was first invented
for the 'Indian Wars' in North America alongside The Hotchkiss Canon- a
gattling gun that shot canonballs. **[The technologies of the permanent
settler war are reserviced for foreign wars, including boarding schools,
colonial schools, urban schools run by military
personnel.]{.underline}** It is properly called Indian Country.
Ideologies of US settler colonialism directly informed Australian
settler colonialism. South African apartheid townships, the kill-zones
in what became the Philippine colony, then nation-state, the
checkerboarding of Palestinian land with checkpoints, were modeled after
U.S. seizures of land and containments of Indian bodies to reservations.
The racial science developed in the U.S. (a settler colonial racial
science) informed Hitler's designs on racial purity ("This book is my
bible" he said of Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race). The
admiration is sometimes mutual, the doctors and administrators of forced
sterilizations of black, Native, disabled, poor, and mostly female
people - The Sterilization Act accompanied the Racial Integrity Act and
the Pocohontas Exception - praised the Nazi eugenics program. Forced
sterilizations became illegal in California in 1964.

liberation of the petite-bourgeoisie opposed to the collective
liberation of the proletariat. [Sex and personal relationships cannot
be]{.underline} **[revolutionized]{.underline}** [except
through]{.underline} **[subordinating them to proletarian
discipline]{.underline}**. Marxists do not view sexuality as a private
affair, since humans are social animals and all things are subject to
criticism from the standpoint of the proletariat. At the same time,
[we]{.underline} seek precisely to [avoid]{.underline} the
**[overemphasis on sex]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[personal
identity]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} postmodernism uses to
[evade]{.underline} the question of **[class struggle]{.underline}** and
to replace political struggle with individual choice.

We repeat Lenin, who pointed out that an overemphasis on questions of
sex plays a destructive role, especially among the youth and the
petite-bourgeoisie.

> Dissoluteness in sexual life is bourgeois, is a phenomenon of decay.
> The proletariat is a rising class. It doesn't need intoxication as a
> narcotic or a stimulus. Intoxication as little by sexual exaggeration
> as by alcohol. \[Lenin on the Women's Question\]

[Capitalism]{.underline} alienates people from one another, and
**[creates relationships based on economic calculation]{.underline}**
and base physical and emotional needs as a rule. [Postmodernism worships
these]{.underline} alienated **[relationships]{.underline}**
[under]{.underline} the **[guise of individual choice]{.underline}**,
[subordinating]{.underline} the **[collective to the
individual]{.underline}** instead of subordinating the individual to the
collective.

Only repeated cultural revolutions under [socialism]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} create a new man and woman and a new society,
[allowing]{.underline} the development of **[authentic
relationships]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} the basis of
**[love]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[social need]{.underline}**.
This orientation places the political question at the forefront: the
struggle for socialist revolution followed by repeated cultural
revolutions, and the subordination of personal relationships to the
political needs of the revolution.

The facts of biological reproduction and the oppression of women rooted
in private property divide society into men and women. While biological
reproduction is the basis, which is reflected for instance in the
struggle over reproductive rights, humans are primarily social animals
and so social relationships conditioned by class society are primarily
determinate on sex and sexuality. [Hence homosexuality and transition to
the social role of the opposite sex has an objective existence that is
conditioned by the historical development of society]{.underline}.

On the other hand, the ideology that underlies non-binary identification
is rooted in idealism and reactionary postmodernism. It argues that [one
can escape the contradiction between]{.underline} **[men and
women]{.underline}** [at]{.underline} an **[individual
level]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} **[personal
feeling]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[superficial]{.underline}**
changes in presentation. [This is positioned as]{.underline}
**[progressive and liberating]{.underline}**. [We see this as part of
the]{.underline} '**[sexual liberation']{.underline}** thesis [that one
can **change society**]{.underline} [solely by changing one's **ideas or
behavior**]{.underline}, or that the only thing which matters is one's
ideas or behaviors, a total **[idealism]{.underline}** [opposed
to]{.underline} **[materialism]{.underline}**. It obscures the basis of
women's emancipation which is an essential question for revolution.

The metaphysics behind the non-binary concept in fact
**[ossifies]{.underline}** the categories of **[men and
women]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} a set of **[superficial
traits]{.underline}**. Rather than a historical materialist approach
which studies how the **[man-woman contradiction]{.underline}** as it
exists today came into being [conditioned by]{.underline} **[private
property]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} thus **[studies how it will
pass away]{.underline}** [with the **abolition** of **private
property**]{.underline}, this ideology poses that, for instance, women
simply are a set of prescribed traits and to deviate from said traits is
to deviate from womanhood. Instead of combating the negative traits
associated with manhood and womanhood as part of understanding the
historical basis and development of the man-woman contradiction, manhood
and womanhood itself is combated, a metaphysical viewpoint that is
distant from the reality of the masses. Marx puts this reality as such:

\[A\]s soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has
a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and
from which he cannot escape. \[The German Ideology\]

We assert that men and women must be remolded in the process of
revolution and social transformation to create a new socialist man and
new socialist woman. Militarization and the reorganization of society
have a transformative effect on men and women: the negative traits
associated with manhood and womanhood will be combated not because men
and women are to be abolished, but to serve the needs of the revolution.
**[Personal relationships]{.underline}** [will be transformed on an
**egalitarian basis**]{.underline}, not for their own sake detached from
class struggle, but precisely to subordinate them to the demands of
proletarian discipline and organization.

Contrary to postmodernism, Marxism places politics as primary and
rejects the view that issues affecting a minority population without a
key role in production is determinate in politics. **[LGBT
people]{.underline}** [are not]{.underline} a **[distinct social
force]{.underline}** and do not have a decisive role in politics as
such. [Imperialism does not depend on]{.underline} the **[discrimination
of LGBT people]{.underline}**, and today 'pink-washes' itself by giving
LGBT people a large degree of legal equality in order to create a false
image of progressivism---the productive forces are developed enough in
the imperialist countries that capitalism has lost its pressing need to
reproduce the oppressed class as not every family needs to produce
children to maintain a socially-necessary proletarian population. The
most advanced revolutionary movements have arisen in the less
'developed' countries, and thus the question of reproduction plays a
more prominent role. We should look at these phenomena in the context of
economic development and remember that the new is born stamped with the
old, and never as a 'pure' new thing.

We reiterate the message of the essay Consumer Options that monogamy and
polyamory both are bourgeois and backwards; similarly both
heterosexuality---[understood as the superstructural support reproducing
the economic unit of the family---and]{.underline}
'**[queerness']{.underline}** [are **old bourgeois forms**]{.underline}
[that oppose the **new**, **socialist social relations**]{.underline}.
In both cases the latter is pushed by postmodernism as the more
progressive option, a new fad to jump onto. Just as the
**[bourgeoisie]{.underline}** cynically [uses]{.underline} the
**[people's alienation]{.underline}** and dissatisfaction with twisted
and corrupted personal relationships [to push]{.underline} **[false
solutions like]{.underline}** polyamory and
'**[queerness]{.underline}**,' the monopoly media uses identity in their
cultural productions [to push]{.underline} the false solutions of
**[inclusivity and positivity]{.underline}**. This is the context in
which non-binary was used in our recent essay Bourgeois Culture is a
Cadaver, showing it to be a hip term cynically used by the bourgeoisie
to [paper over]{.underline} **[people's]{.underline}** subjective
dissatisfaction and their **[oppression]{.underline}**.

### 1NC \-- Link \-- Atonality

#### The aff starts from a politics of queer atonality -- a reduction of queerness to basic deviance that deprives it of moral or political force -- instead, we should have a politics of queer communality that refuses the 1AC's strong commitment to anti-normativity in favor of direct institutional transformation

**Galloway 2014** (Alexander, Professor of Media, Culture, and
Communication at New York University, "Queer Atonality,"
http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/queer-atonality)

Rosenberg devotes much of her attention to queer theory's "subjectless
turn" and the shift toward what David Eng, Judith Halberstam, and José
Muñoz in 2005 called the "wide field of normalization." Yet here [the
question is not so much a shift within queer theory, but a growing
normalization]{.underline}\--and a newfound trendiness perhaps\--[of the
concept of queer in culture at large.]{.underline} Thus **[today any
number of folks in straight relationships might still wish to label
themselves "queer," just as there is a growing trend to think about
queer societies,]{.underline}** queer **[animals,]{.underline}** and
indeed queer **[organisms,]{.underline}** queer molecules,
**[and]{.underline}** queer **[ontologies.]{.underline}** Rosenberg
calls out Tim Morton\'s essay "Queer Ecology," but the trend is wider
than a single text can reveal, as evidenced by Karen Barad\'s work on
"Nature's Queer Performativity," or the promulgation in other circles of
what we might call a Queer-Deleuzian metaphysics. Borrowing the concept
of the \"atonal\" (atone) from Badiou\'s theory of points, it is
possible to assign a name to the specific form of queerness that
Rosenberg finds unnerving: queer atonality. [By **queer atonality** we
mean the notion that queerness can be abstracted to mean **deviation as
such**]{.underline}, aleatoriness as such, or openness as such, [and
thus, through such extreme abstraction, queerness may be assigned as a
proper monicker for biological and even ontological
systems.]{.underline} In other words, if biology is that thing that
works via difference and radical openness, then it is, by definition,
queer. Or if ontology is a scenario of swerves and deviations, then it
is, by definition, queer. As Rosenberg puts it, on the one hand "biology
\[is understood\] as a kind of sheer queerness (or, aleatoriness)," and,
on the other, matter "is coded as ontologically \'queer.\'" But ["do we
truly want **to be unleashed into pure aleatoriness**?"]{.underline}
wonders Rosenberg. [Such **is the Pyrrhic victory of queer atonality**:
"If queerness is nothing but the productive force of matter, then why
continue to call it queer?"]{.underline} [As a deviation from normality,
queerness has typically carried a kind of ethical or political force
simply by virtue of intervening and resisting. We\'re here, we\'re
queer]{.underline} demands acknowledgement, and thus a disruption of
bourgeois morality. [In this sense, queer means essentially
\"queering.\"]{.underline} As Nicholas de Villiers writes in his book on
queer opacity, queering is a tactic aimed at appropriating,
transforming, or deviating from a particular normative category. In this
way, queer might have no ontological dimension per se, but rather might
be defined as that thing unable to be integrated into existing symbolic
economies, be they sexual or otherwise. **[But]{.underline}** if
**[today]{.underline}**, following in the wake of the new queer
metaphysics, matter and organic life themselves are queer, then the
**[queer intervention becomes as atonal as anything else]{.underline}**:
the queerness of quantum superposition, the queerness of interspecies
viral transfection, the queerness of non-carbon-based life forms.
**[What started as a process of strategic intervention, has now
congealed into a state of \"sheer\" queerness.]{.underline}** Further,
[ontologizing queerness produces a number of secondary
effects]{.underline}, not all of which we can discuss here. [One
important additional issue]{.underline} though\--and this parallels some
of my previous commentary on Catherine Malabou, whose work I find
tremendously useful\--[is]{.underline} what might be called [the
"morality conundrum."]{.underline} In short: [if ontology is pure
aleatoriness and if ontology has no particular political]{.underline} or
moral [valence, then, **barring the kind of unmitigated nihilism that
makes all politics impossible, one is obligated to graft on a secondary
moral theory**]{.underline} to supplement the primary ontological one.
Consider Malabou: [if all is plasticity,]{.underline} then [how can an
individual judge good]{.underline} plasticity [from bad
plasticity?]{.underline} By what criterion may we assert, with
confidence, that capitalist precarity (one form of plasticity) is
odious, while neuronal adaptiveness (another form of plasticity) is not?
Such is the curious irony of queer atonality. **[What began as a
movement that, in part, sought to purge itself of the priggish
prejudices of sexual moralism]{.underline}**, and the bigotry and
oppression that goes with it, **[must now author its own treatise on
morality!]{.underline}** Having been elevated to the level of being,
[queer theory must demonstrate its own deviation from
being.]{.underline} [Having been neutralized, queerness must now
un-neutralize itself.]{.underline} I follow this thread not to revel in
futility, nor to expose queer theory to another kind of derision, now
from the left rather than the right. Instead let\'s ask what we might
gain from ontologizing queerness? And what we might lose? Or to put the
question another way: if there were a queering of ontology, what should
it look like? I can think of two ways to address the question, one more
negative and the other more affirmative. But there are certainly many
other possible approaches suggested by others. Response A: Viewed
skeptically, queer ontology appears to be something of a contradiction
in terms, simply because ontology itself is offensive and oppressive to
queer life and identity. Ontology reproduces the very structure of queer
alterity, given how ontology tends to be transcendental, abstracting,
totalizing, and tied historically to concepts of hierarchy and morality,
etc. "Ontology," Frantz Fanon wrote in Black Skin, White Masks, "does
not permit us to understand the being of the black man." And thus, by
homology, [ontology does not permit us to understand the being of the
queer.]{.underline} This response seems absolutely valid and yet at the
same time somewhat limiting. Absolutely valid\--in the sense that
metaphysics has often been used as a weapon against the poor, women,
people of color, or anyone on the losing end of moral or metaphysical
models of alterity. But also limiting\--in the sense that ignoring such
questions will not magically cause them to disappear; any theoretical
undertaking, when pursued long enough, must come to terms with questions
of being, appearing, and existing. Indeed, ontology "does not
permit"\--as Fanon rightly said\--but only when ontology is understood
as representation or metaphysics. What if there were such a thing as a
non-standard ontology? Could a non-standard ontology allow us to
withdraw from structures of oppression? And could it facilitate such a
withdrawal, while avoiding the problem of atonality and maintaining the
many specificities of people\'s real culture and history? Response B:
This leads to a second response, one that I see as much more useful: [a
queer theory of ontology is]{.underline} indeed [possible]{.underline}.
**[But]{.underline}** how would it look? **[It might not "look queer" in
the]{.underline}** aforementioned **[sense of queer
atonality]{.underline}** that Rosenberg calls into question, that is, an
ontology [rooted in aleatoriness, deviation,
non-normativity]{.underline}, and so on. **[Such a new queer theory of
ontology would not be queer per se]{.underline}**\--that\'s by
design\--**[but]{.underline}** would be **[roomy enough for
queerness]{.underline}**, along with other forms of life and other kinds
of being in the world. Consider two different approaches. The first is a
kind of hypertrophic instance of what, in theoretical circles, is called
intersectionalism. We can understand such hypertrophic intersectionalism
as a maximally heterogenous set of all forms of difference, brought into
community without sacrificing the specificity and difference of all
members of the set. This is not unlike how Hardt & Negri have defined
the "multitude," the multitude as capacious heterogeneity unmarked by
homogenizing abstractions like "the masses" or "the people." (It would
take another blog post to demonstrate how the multitude is not simply a
new form of queer atonality; but I think the argument can be made
effectively.) The second approach comes from a different angle. If
intersectionalism is maximally heterogenous, [a different
approach]{.underline} also [exists]{.underline}, [the minimally
heterogenous.]{.underline} Here, **[the community of alterity is defined
not in terms of radical difference, but radical
commonality.]{.underline}** Similar to the concept of the "generic" in
Laruelle or Badiou, [I see a new potential for queer ontology to be
understood in terms of radical equality via axiomatic exploration of the
insufficiency of identity.]{.underline} Indeed, Rosenberg links
queerness to the concept of collectivity. This is the crucial step in my
view. Summoning the allegorical style of Fredric Jameson, Rosenberg
directs our attention not to "the subject per se, or \'the human,\' but
the collective." And isn\'t this what materialism has always sought?
"Surely the collective is that aleatory togetherness of which the
ontological turn dreams." So, [**instead of queerness as the productive
force of aleatory matter**, we might pursue]{.underline} instead [the
concept of a "queer event"]{.underline} or the "event of queer
collectivity." I suspect that [such an event would not
follow]{.underline} some of the more [familiar models from the past:
event as deviation, difference, or alterity.]{.underline} Given that
queer atonality is simply the macro form of such smaller
deviations\--the model of turbulence and churn described so well in
Queer Deleuzianism\--such theories of deviation have a limited utility.
In addition, the queer event would most certainly not follow a
productive or reproductive mandate; this being one of the most powerful
discoveries of queer theory, that the queer body is not obligated to
make anything. Instead **[we might explore the concept of a queer
communism]{.underline}**, or what Rosenberg simply labels the
collectivity. **[This strikes me as particularly useful and urgent
today.]{.underline}** In other words, **[Rosenberg\'s essay reveals that
today\'s onto-primitivism is really a march toward
proletarianization]{.underline}**, which we might simply define as the
bracketing of social collectivity in the name of material necessity.
**[Such proletarianization must be identified as such, and resisted as
frequently and as thoroughly as possible.]{.underline}** Or as Rosenberg
puts it, "Let it never be said of us that our consciousness was sheerly
molecular, that we truly believed that all the baleful historical
foreclosures of capitalism were ontologically true." **[Never believe
that capitalism is ontologically true\... This is]{.underline}**, in
essence, **[the first step toward exploring any form of
collectivity.]{.underline}** [**Queer atonality blocks such a
movement**, not because queerness has been fully co-opted]{.underline}
and hence has nothing more to offer. On the contrary, the problem with
queer ontology lies in ontology not queerness, for [the standard model
of ontology]{.underline} is one that is sufficient to itself and thus
[promulgates a structure of transcendental mastery, rational autonomy,
and sufficiency for all.]{.underline} Queer communism, by contrast,
resides in the making-insufficient of such philosophical structures.
**[Queer communism reorients queerness away from deviation and alterity
and toward the "weak" insufficiency of collectivity, a life lived in
common with others]{.underline}**, whosoever they may be.

At the same time, however, [**we still live in an era of foreclosed hope
in the possibility of a better world**.]{.underline} What makes the
tragedy of Willie Loman so universal now is [**that even [people]{.mark}
who [wonder]{.mark} whether [the capitalist dream isn't the wrong
dream]{.mark} see no way of realizing a life beyond
capitalism**,]{.underline} or fear that any attempt to do so can only
result in another nightmare. [**[Overcoming this]{.mark} debilitating
political pessimism [is]{.mark} the most [important]{.mark} question
anyone seriously [interested in social change]{.mark} must
confront**.]{.underline} Socialists search for what direction to take
under these conditions, it helps to know that others before have faced
the same problem. How to make 'the defeated man \... try the outside
world again' was precisely the question that impelled Ernst Bloch in the
1930s to write his magnum opus, The Principle ofHope.2Pessimism --
'paralysis per se' -- was the first obstacle to be
confronted:\...**[people who do not believe at all in a [happy end
impede changing the world almost as much as the sweet
swindlers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the marriage-swindlers, the charlatans
of apotheosis. **[[Unconditional pessimism]{.mark} therefore
[promotes]{.mark} the [business of reaction]{.mark} not much
[less]{.mark} than [artificially conditioned optimism]{.mark}; the
latter is nevertheless not so ~~stupid~~ that it [does not believe in
anything at all]{.mark}.]{.underline} I**t does not immortalize the
trudging of the little life, does not give humanity the face of a
chloroformed gravestone. It does not give the world the deathly sad
background in front of which it is not worth doing anything at all. In
contrast to a pessimism which itself belongs to rotten-ness and may
serve it, a tested optimism, when the scales fall from the eyes, does
not deny the goal-belief in general; on the contrary, what matters now
is to find the right one and to prove it... In recent years we have seen
all too many **[[disillusioned people]{.mark} on the left 'coming to
their senses' by [abandoning the goal of socialism]{.mark}.
[Some]{.mark} have [succumbed to a post-modernist pessimism]{.mark},
which has indeed proved to be 'paralysis per se'.]{.underline}** Even
more seem to have jumped from what Bloch called the 'evils of putschist
activism' all the way to social democracy's 'third way', **[whose
[presumption]{.mark} that [neo-liberal prescriptions of
efficiency]{.mark} are [compatible with social
justice]{.mark}]{.underline}** is the contemporary expression of what
Bloch designated as one of the key hallmarks of ideology -- 'the
premature harmonization of social contradictions' within the confines of
existing social relations. **[[Frustrated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} their
[inability to change the world overnight through sheer activism]{.mark},
they [have not]{.mark} so much [abandoned the idea of change]{.mark}
but]{.underline}**, like the Greek God Procrustes **who [adjusted the
size of his guests to fit the size of his bed, they have shrunk the
meaning of change to fit what capital and the state will
accommodate.]{.underline}** Yet it is increasingly apparent from the
extreme limitations of the 'third way' in practice that
**[[reviving]{.mark} the [goal of socialism]{.mark} is
[necessary]{.mark} even [to make small improvements]{.mark} in the
current state of the world.]{.underline}** As Bloch put it: 'If the
will-content of the goal is missing, then even the good probable is left
undone; if the goal remains, however, then even the improbable can be
done, or at least made more probable for later.'

**[Imagine a [radical movement]{.mark} which had [suffered]{.mark} an
[emphatic defeat]{.mark}. So emphatic, in fact, that it see[med unlikely
to resurface for the length of a lifetime]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if
even then. The defeat I have in mind is not just the kind of rebuff with
which the political left is depressingly familiar, but a repulse so
definitive that it seemed to discredit the very paradigms with which
such politics had traditionally worked. It would now be less a matter of
hotly contesting these notions than of contemplating them with something
of the mild antiquarian interest with which one might regard Ptolemaic
cosmology or the scholasticism of Duns Scotus. They, and the language of
conventional society, would now seem less ferociously at odds than
simply incommensurable-- the discourses of different planets rather than
of adjacent nations. **[What if [the left]{.mark} were suddenly to [find
itself less overwhelmed]{.mark} or out-manoeuvred than simply washed up,
[speaking a discourse]{.mark} so quaintly [out of tune with]{.mark} the
[modern era]{.mark} that, as with the language of Gnosticism or courtly
love, [nobody]{.mark} even [bothered any longer to enquire]{.mark} into
its truth value?]{.underline}** What if the vanguard were to become the
remnant, **[its [arguments]{.mark} still [dimly intelligible]{.mark} but
[spinning off]{.mark} rapidly [into]{.mark} some [metaphysical
outer]{.mark} [space]{.mark} where they [became]{.mark} nothing but a
[muffled]{.mark} cry?]{.underline}** What would be the likely reaction
of the political left to such a defeat? **[Many, no doubt, would drift
either cynically or sincerely to the right, regretting their earlier
views as infantile idealism.]{.underline}** Others would keep the faith
out of habit or nostalgia, **[[clinging]{.mark} anxiously [to]{.mark} an
[imaginary identity]{.mark} and [risking the neurosis which]{.mark} this
is likely to [bring in its wake]{.mark}. There are, after all, those
devotees for whom nothing whatsoever could count as a falsification of
their beliefs]{.underline}**-- those Christians, for example, who true
to what the philosophers of science call the 'under-determination of
data by theory', would continue to gather joyfully around the
eucharistic table even if it had been shown to everyone else's
satisfaction that the gospels were fraudulent from start to finish.
Indeed there are members of the Anglican church today who behave in more
or less this way. But other responses could be expected too. **[A small
clutch of left triumphalists, incurably sanguine, would no doubt carry
on detecting impending signs of revolution in the faintest flicker of
militancy. In others the [radical impulse would persist]{.mark}, but
[would be forced to migrate elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
[governing assumption of such an epoch]{.mark}, one imagines, would be
that [the system]{.mark} itself [was unbreachable]{.mark}; and a great
many [radical positions]{.mark} which [might seem]{.mark} superficially
[unrelated]{.mark} could be seen [to flow from this gloomy
presupposition]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One might expect, for example,
that there would be an upsurge of interest in the margins and crevices
of the system-- in those ambiguous, indeterminate spots where its power
seemed less implacable, the shadowy margins where it trailed off into
silence. The system could not be breached; but it could at least be
momentarily transgressed, probed for those neuralgic points where its
authority faltered and unravelled. Fascinated by these fault-lines,
**[one might even [come to imagine]{.mark} that there is [no centre to
society after all]{.mark}; but [while this might be]{.mark} a
[convenient]{.mark} way of [rationalizing one's own lack of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it could only be at the cost of
acknowledging that there can logically be no margins either. One might
expect this fact itself might be calculated into the theory-- that a
bleak awareness of the collusion between centre and margins, power and
rupture, of the stealthy cat-and-mouse game played out between them,
would go hand in hand with a more heady affirmation of whatever the
system itself expelled as so much detritus, of whatever its ruling
rationality seemed not to incorporate. One could envisage much
celebration of the marginal and minority as positive in themselves-- an
absurd enough view, of course, since margins and minorities currently
include neo-Nazis, UFO buffs, the international bourgeoisie and those
who believe in lashing delinquent adolescents until the blood runs down
their thighs. The idea of a creative majority movement, for this habit
of mind as much as for the old-style liberalism of a John Stuart Mill,
would come to seem like a contradiction in terms, precisely because this
style of thought, suitably amnesiac, could no longer remember any
instance of a beneficent system or an appealing mass movement. At its
extreme, such a case ought to find it hard to cope with a previously
marginal current becoming politically dominant (the African National
Congress, for example), given its formalist prejudice against
'dominance' as such. Logically speaking, it could only hope that its own
values would never come to power. [**The [ideas of system, consensus and
organization]{.mark} [would]{.mark} themselves [become demonized]{.mark}
in vaguely [anarchistic fashion, denounced as absolute ills by those
committed to a tolerant relativism]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The
historical basis of this belief would be that political movements which
were at once mass, central and productive had temporarily gone out of
business; but it ill befits an historicizing brand of thought to
generalize this to a universal doctrine[**. It would be the [theory of
those]{.mark} who were [too young to recall]{.mark} a mass [radical
politics]{.mark}, but who had a good deal of glum experience of drearily
oppressive majorities**.]{.underline} The notions of law and authority
might also be indiscriminately devalued, as though there was no such
thing as a protective law or a benign authority. Theorists would mock
the madness of the Law in suburban enclaves protected by private
security guards, celebrating transgression as inherently good while
worrying about child abuse. **[[Protest would still be possible]{.mark};
but because [the system would instantly recongeal]{.mark} around [this
irritant]{.mark} like a jellyfish, t[he radical sensibility would be
accordingly divided]{.mark}-- [between]{.mark} a brittle
[pessimism]{.mark} on the one hand, [and an exhilarated vision of
ceaseless difference, mobility, disruption]{.mark} on the
other.]{.underline}**
