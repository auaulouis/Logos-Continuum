Judith Butler's notion of **[[derealization]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
very well [[have become]{.mark} one of the premier analytics for
considering [the **epistemological ravages performed by the**]{.mark}
so-called "**[War on 'Terror'" upon]{.mark}** countless **[racialized
bodies and collectives]{.mark}**]{.underline} (this is, of course,
[contemporaneous to the physical ravages of bombs, bullets, metal cages
and attendant tortures]{.underline}). Butler qualifies the status
afforded the Muslim "Other," [[the]{.mark} enemy of the interminable
"War on 'Terror," as a kind of **[ontological limbo]{.mark}**, one fully
admitted neither to life nor death:]{.underline}

**[If [violence]{.mark} is done [against those who are
unreal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then, from the perspective of violence,
[**it [fails to injure or negate those lives since those lives are
already negated]{.mark}**. But they have a strange way of remaining
animated and so must be negated again]{.underline} (and again). [**[They
cannot be mourned because they]{.mark} are always already lost or,
rather, [never "were," and]{.mark} they [must be killed]{.mark}**, since
they seem to live on, stubbornly, in this state of
deadness]{.underline}... The derealization of the "Other" means that [it
is]{.underline} neither alive nor dead, but [interminably
spectral]{.underline}. (Precarious Life 33-4)

Michael Malek Najjar's gloss of Butler's concept cleanly emphasizes how
[the notion of "spectrality" ensures the endlessness of both the
paranoia of and against the Arab subject as well as the interminability
of the so-called "war" waged against the "terror" with which they are
both suddenly and transcendentally coupled]{.underline} (152). In fact,
this "war" is not only interminable; Najjar's resuscitation of Butler's
2004 framework also implies that, in a very real sense, the beginning of
this "war" in earnest is inevitably deferred, for: "[the derealization
of the Other' means that it is neither alive nor dead, but interminably
spectral"]{.underline} (Butler 33-4), an insight of Butler's that Najjar
expands to surmise that "[[**Interminable spectrality** is]{.mark} a
state where subjects are forced into a liminal position **[where]{.mark}
[they]{.mark}** are not allowed to live freely and instead **[become
victims of an infinite paranoia]{.mark}**... they are left in a state
where they cannot be freed until the socalled "war on terror" is
realized"]{.underline} (ibid, emphasis mine).

This understanding of the "war on 'terror'" as a state offensive that is
simultaneously endless and also only ever about to begin couples a
framework for racial and epistemological precarity with paradoxical
temporal inflections. That this split temporality is rife with strategic
benefit is patently obvious via the similarly contradictory ensemble of
legal neologisms its perpetuation has generated (e.g., enemy combatant,
a construct endemic to the timeless time of the "war on 'terror'" that
simultaneously marshals the full, exceptional weight of the Law against
an implicated subject that is inoculated against any of its typical
precautions). [With no fixed end---or beginning---locatable, the "war on
'terror's'" pacification prosaics enact their violence through [a
chronological assault that **exceeds the**]{.mark} **presumed
[finality]{.mark} [of notions such as]{.mark}** Fukuyama's "**[end of
history"]{.mark}**]{.underline}75 [and Jameson's cultural
"schizophrenia."]{.underline}76

[**The [players]{.mark}** in this killing farce, then, **are not only
geopolitics**, **nor racial politics**, and not even these combined with
epistemological politics alone. For the stage is also **[haunted by a
politics of time]{.mark}**, a **chronopolitics [that constellates the
workings of each of these components with fatal precision and nimble
contingency]{.mark}**.]{.underline}77 I argue that, just as the
[pacification prosaics endemic to the "war on 'terror'" are effectuated
via a politics of time, so too do security poetics likewise utilize
their own textual politics of time as a means of staging their
dissent]{.underline}. But there is a crucial distinction: while
[[the]{.mark} "[war on 'terror's" pacification prosaics are
**assembled** **around** tropes of a **single Time**,]{.mark} a
mono-Time, resistant security poetics upend this para-Time via a
temporal pluralization that is irreducible in its
complexity.]{.underline} What follows will therefore be an attempt to
illuminate the nature and significance of the chronopolitics found
within three particular texts: two plays by Ismail Khalidi---Truth Serum
Blues (2005) and Dead Are My People (2018, and still in process) and a
novel by Mohja Kahf, The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf (2006). I find it
important to note that the choice of texts is simultaneously intentional
and arbitrary, by which I mean that any number of texts with similar
topical concerns might have worked for the purposes of this analysis.
And yet, analytical intentionality is cohered through the texts'
temporal orientations (by which I refer to the date of publication for
Kahf's novel and Khalidi's earlier play, and the historical setting of
Khalidi's most recent theatrical work). On this point, I find it both
conceptually humorous and intellectually perfect that Khalidi slightly
attempted to dissuade me from using Truth Serum Blues, his first play,
within my dissertation because, as he wrote in an email, "it is nearly
fifteen years old." After all, what is a decade or more when hegemonic
registers continue to police and restrict collective access to time and
history?

Here (or now, if you will), it is necessary to sketch out some important
distinctions between time and history, though the two are certainly
interrelated. Along with "events," time is conventionally understood as
a unit of history, with the latter accommodating various strategies of
explicit reflexivity regarding the passage of time and the
transpiring---and subsequent schematization---of variously significant
occurrences. Hayden White grasped as much when he argued that
historiography is perceived as approaching the quality of "reality" the
more it reveals the trait of "narrativity,"78 that history is considered
history proper only insofar as it reveals the sequential ordering of
events over a given period into the form of a story. The implications of
this argument are, of course, a blow to the "objective" character of
history. If history is a story, or series of stories in form rather than
in essence, other stories---or "Other" stories---can be told over,
above, in between, and in place of hegemonic (hi)stories.

Of course, [history entails more of a sense of entanglement than
time]{.underline}. It is for this reason, as Eagleton notes, that it is
by no means incidental that Heidegger titled his study Being and Time
rather than Being and History:

[**[My]{.mark} own personal [history is authentically meaningful when I
accept responsibility for my own existence]{.mark}**, seize my own
future possibilities and live in enduring awareness of my own future
death]{.underline}. This may or may not be true, but it does not seem to
have any immediate relevance to how I live 'historically' in the sense
of being bound up with particular individuals, actual social relations
and concrete institutions... '**[[True' history]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for Heidegger [**is [an inward, 'authentic' or 'existential'
history]{.mark}**---a mastering of dread and nothingness, **[a
resoluteness towards death]{.mark}**, a 'gathering in' of my
powers]{.underline}---[which operates in effect as a substitute for
history in its more common and practical senses.]{.underline} As...
Georg Lukács put it, Heidegger's famous 'historicity' is not really
distinguishable from ahistoricity. (57)

Yet even as history implies more of a sense of interrelatedness and
complicity to others, its [narrativation can retain a hegemonic,
exclusionary function]{.underline}. C. Riley Snorton describes the
implications that race and racialization have for these conversations in
building upon the insights of Tavia Nyong'o:

\[O\]ne might also consider that race is a history of theory that
functions to express what is un/thinkable across complex
temporalities... history becomes less a program for examining change
over time and more an examination in disruptions in linear time. Race,
then, becomes a way of thinking history doubly, or of thinking about the
history of historicity. (Black on Both Sides 8)

[The **[security poetics]{.mark}** employed]{.underline} by writers
under analysis in this chapter, then, [are under a double-bind: on the
one hand, they must challenge the presentist exceptionalism of the "war
on 'terror's'" pacification prosaics. But in doing so, they must also be
careful not to reinscribe hegemonic historical narritivations that evade
"disruptions in linear time."]{.underline} Rather, [their challenges
**[must simultaneously dismantle artificial temporal exceptions and
overly-exclusive conceptions of temporality and
history.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The preceding comments suggest how the "war on 'terror'" insinuates a
perpetual present vis-à-vis derealization. Perhaps naturally enough, if
a perpetual present is what is at issue, the solution might seem to be a
historicization of this perpetual present. Yet a few further comments on
the chronopolitics of both the "war on 'terror'" as well as dissenting
literatures will help clarify why this would be an ultimately misguided
endeavor, according to the terms of this analysis.

[The "war on 'terror'" edifies its perpetual present via several
temporal technologies]{.underline}, the first of which I am presently
terming "**[[terrorist exceptionalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Simply put, [this refers to the phenomenon by which the currently
racialized figure of the "terrorist" **[is imbued with a transhistorical
omniscience]{.mark}**, conscripted as [**an "enemy combatant" of
fearsome existential proportions** and]{.mark} the subsequent [ability
to upend]{.mark} not only individual (white, "freedom loving"/"dutiful
citizen") life, but also **to** rend the very fabric of [**hegemonic
Western democratic "enlightened" civilization** beyond]{.mark}
[repair]{.mark}. A symptomatic reading of the current terms of
presentist racial-imperial anxiety make these dimensions evident
enough.]{.underline} But equally as important as the current
adumbrations of terrorist exceptionalization is a consideration of the
forms it has taken in the past. For example, though [the so-called
"Islamic fundamentalist" is inextricable from the category of
"terrorist"]{.underline} today, 19th century [American racial anxieties
told a far different story, one of Eastern Europeans with dynamite
ever-ready to obliterate key sites of capitalist
production]{.underline}. For this reason, Jeffory Clymer argues,
racialized anxieties about "terrorism" are indissociable from paranoid
vigilance surrounding the integrity of the capitalist system (America's
Culture of Terrorism 13). Furthermore, even following intense government
scrutiny of Arab- and Arab American activism and uprising during the
Cold War era, Sarah Gualtieri importantly reminds us that [[**Arab
American** activists]{.mark} such as the members of the Association of
Arab American University Graduates (AAUG) were **[accused of being
"godless communists"]{.mark}** for their championing of the Palestinian
freedom struggle, while today they would be far more likely to be
condemned as "Muslim terrorists"]{.underline} (Between Arab and White
173[). **[The "terrorist,"]{.underline}**]{.mark} [then, is not and
**[never has been transhistorically coherent, but rather contingently
overdetermined by capitalist, geopolitical and racial fixations and
anxieties.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Related to terrorist exceptionalization is another cultural technology
of the "war on 'terror'" that I refer to as "Muslim Exceptionalization."
Here I refer to the "war on 'terror's'" current occlusion of Muslim
identity that historically preceded post WWII Arab immigration, spanning
all the way back to Antebellum Muslim slave identity as well as the
activism of organizations such as the Nation of Islam during the Black
Power movement. The negative idealization of the "terrorist" as
ultimately Arab, even while it does not exculpate Black bodies from
ongoing interpellation into the framework of "terrorism,"79 nevertheless
symbolically levels important histories of resistance, thereby
fracturing the capacity for dissenting collectivities to more naturally
gravitate towards mutual uplift and joint struggle.80

[The final cultural technology of relevance for this investigation is
what I am terming "securitization's disciplinary tautology." This
concept is intended to capture the more individualized leveling of past
and present that occurs when the charge of "terrorism" is deployed
against a suspect. **[By way of a strategic, syntactical inversion, the
objectified subject of such a charge is suddenly deprived of any
narrational or temporal recourse for exculpation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Any and all responses to the charge merely confirm its elastic accuracy.
For, according to this disciplinary tautology: [one already always-was a
"terrorist" because one is accused. One is accused because one already
always-was a "terrorist."]{.underline}

I opt for the term disfiguring in place of historicizing to refer to
these text's resistance to the "war on 'terror's" chronopolitics because
to claim these texts "historicize" would be to imply one single,
coherent notion of time and history, a construct these texts in fact
elude and destabilize as part of their imaginative insurgency.
Disfiguring simultaneously both the possibility of "disfigurement"---of
scarring the illusionary veneer of the perpetual present to reveal
glimpses of the time-worlds surging beneath---as well as "figuring,"
meaning a textual representation of the "war on 'terror's" temporal
assaults.

In the 2013 special issue of the Journal of Literary and Cultural
Disability Studies, Merri Lisa Johnson and Robert McRuer identify
[**[cripistemologies]{.mark}** as]{.underline} forms [of "prohibited
knowledge" that **[emerge out of]{.mark}**]{.underline} the experience
of
**[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[10](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-10) Johnson
and McRuer's essay contributed to ushering in a critical form of
disability studies, joining other work such as earlier issues
of Lateral that featured Julie Avril Minich, Jina B. Kim, and Sami
Schalk.[11](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-11) Johnson
and McRuer's contribution to this conversation was to coin
"cripistemology," as [a way of **[dismantling the expectation of
knowledge from disability "experts,"]{.mark}** and prioritizing instead
the knowledges of those whose bodyminds cannot or will not be cured into
normativity.]{.underline} Johnson and McRuer are insistent on taking a
capacious view of what experiencing disability means, and consequently
who is capable of producing knowledge through cripistemological methods;
Johnson and McRuer include, importantly, the knowledge gained from being
in relation with another who has been disabled. 

[Decentering the disability expert explodes the conventional disability
studies canon]{.underline}. In a section called "Sensational Crips,"
Johnson and McRuer ground their theory in women of color feminisms and
queer
theory.[12](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-12) [What
distinguishes expertise on disability]{.underline} (conventional
disability studies) [from]{.underline} their conceptualization of
[cripistemology]{.underline} (critical disability studies), [is
[this]{.mark} specific **[genealogy]{.mark}** that insists on **[reading
disability]{.mark}** in and **[through imbrications with gender,
sexuality, class, and race]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For example, Jina B.
Kim imagines [a "crip-of-color critique"]{.underline} [that links
together women of color feminist texts that explore themes of chronic
illness]{.underline} (Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzaldúa), [with recent
disability scholarship that foregrounds race]{.underline} (Jasbir Puar,
Therí Pickens), [through [a coalitional framework of queer of color
critique]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cathy Cohen, Rodrick
Ferguson).[13](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-13) In
the present study, I pick up on the radical political economy thread
within critical disability studies that also marks it as a distinct
formation. Just as feminist of color and queer of color theory is
grounded in Marxist political economy, Johnson and McRuer's
conceptualization indicates that critical disability studies offer a
unique critique of formations of capitalism, and specifically the
disabling conditions of precarity under
neoliberalism.[14](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-14) 

[Crips and mad people offer knowledge that emanates from their position
as a "surplus" class whose presence threatens the political and economic
order.]{.underline}[15](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-15) As
other scholars have elaborated, [**[society has developed]{.mark}** the
ideology]{.underline}, since at least the end of the nineteenth century,
[that bodyminds that carry disease, illness, and impairment are a
"menace]{.underline}."[16](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-16) [This
ideology]{.underline}, that [I]{.underline} would [label as
**[eugenics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, promises a future of human
perfection through scientifically guided interventions that dispose of
diseased, ill, and impaired bodyminds. During the so-called eugenics era
of the 1890s to 1940s, state and federal policies were implemented in
the name of saving the human race and western civilization from rapid
degeneration caused by the reproduction of those from so-called
defective
bloodlines.[17](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-17) [Eugenics
policies]{.underline}, including [**[institutionalization,
sterilization, restrictive immigration]{.mark}**, and **[deportation,
articulated]{.mark}** disabled and **[mad bodyminds as crises]{.mark}**
that threatened the imagined future of human
perfection]{.underline}.[18](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-18) However,
these policies fluctuated between contradictory impulses. On the one
side, the crisis of tainted bloodlines called for the state-sanctioned
neglect and premature death of those inside eugenics institutions, those
whose bodyminds could not be made to conform to normative standards of
health. On the other side, paradoxically, the state also promised to
create perfect human health through experimental treatments,
rehabilitation programs, and cures, including reproductive sterilization
on the very same bodies that were neglected and exposed to
death.[19](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-19) 

[The surplus class of disabled and mad bodyminds constructed in the
eugenics era programs was gendered and
racialized.[20](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-20) The
sociotechnical imaginary of eugenics conjured a specifically "female"
threat, relying for justification on fears of unruly people with
uteruses  whose reproductive capacity required containment.]{.underline}
Eugenics programs had specific effects on people with uteruses 
including longer recovery from sterilization surgeries like the
salpingectomy. The [**[threat]{.mark} [of unfit reproduction]{.mark} was
[grounded in]{.mark} white supremacist [fears of race suicide]{.mark},
and eugenics programs [capitalized on long-standing legal
regimes]{.mark}** (including [slavery]{.mark} and [colonialism]{.mark})
**[that deny racialized gendered people bodily
autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[21](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-21) 

**[[When outright eugenics became outmoded]{.underline}]{.mark}**
following World War II and the stalling of the Great Society in the
United States, new modes of governance were introduced that continued to
draw on the eugenicist imaginary. These [**[new]{.mark} modes of
[governance]{.mark}**, including]{.underline} policies [of
[**privatization**, **deregulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and
[**market liberalization**, exploded into]{.mark}]{.underline} what Mia
Mingus, Eli Clare, and others call "[[the]{.mark} **[m]{.mark}edical
[i]{.mark}ndustrial
[c]{.mark}omplex**]{.underline}."[22](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-22) In
the medical industrial complex, billions of dollars are funneled into
[the discovery of new diseases and impairments, while pharmaceutical and
technological innovations are promised that can rid society of disease
and impairment "once and for all."]{.underline} [As an outcome of
neoliberalism, the medical industrial complex continued the eugenicist
project of locating crisis within disabled and mad
bodyminds,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} again [promised social health
could be achieved by curing disease and disability. [This]{.mark}
theorization]{.underline} of the medical industrial complex [[**maps**
**onto**]{.underline}]{.mark} what political theorist Giorgio Agamben
names [**[the "state of exception]{.mark}"** as a mode of liberal
governance]{.underline}.[23](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-23) According
to Agamben, [[the]{.mark} temporality]{.underline} of neoliberalism
[justifies the [permanent]{.mark}ly [temporary suspension of civil
liberties]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, the medical industrial
complex's rhetoric of crisis and recovery justifies the curtailment of
bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom for populations including mad
and disabled people, poor and racialized women, and bodyminds with
diverse genders. 

However, [[**despite** the **rehabilitative promise**]{.mark},
neoliberal policies of [**deregulation**, **privatization**, and]{.mark}
market [**liberalization** **are implicated in** **creating
the**]{.mark} very **[conditions of precarity]{.mark}** that exacerbate
illness, impairment, and mental insecurity]{.underline}. Over the last
three decades of the twentieth century, organized government divestment
from urban and rural communities that were segregated by race and class
from white suburbs left communities of color and poor communities to
rely on themselves for access to education, food, and security. [The
already flimsy social safety net was systematically dismantled through
the end of the twentieth century through privatization and
disinvestment.]{.underline} At the same time, growing wealth inequality
ground down the middle class by pushing all but the super-rich into
competition for scarce resources. It was in this context that Butler
wrote Parable of the Sower, fictionalizing her portrayal of a
multiracial neighborhood forced into extreme self-reliance. The
situation has only worsened in the twenty-first century, as the economy
rapidly concentrates jobs in low-paying service and gig industries.

These neoliberal governance policies have a particular impact on
disabled and mad people, particularly those who are also racialized and
gendered. The process of closing or reducing the size of state
psychiatric hospitals and institutions for people classified as
intellectually/developmentally disabled beginning the 1960s---known as
deinstitutionalization---was one of the first acts of privatization in
the neoliberal model in the US. Subsequently, the US has created a
bifurcated neoliberal system where the minority, typically white and
wealthy, disabled people receive care only through private medical
insurance or family members, while many more disabled and mad people of
color have been criminalized and warehoused in jails and prisons. Even
when public funds are invested in care, the neoliberal state has
repeatedly refused to invest in treatments and services that would keep
people alive, well, and out of institutions, funneling public money into
private industries like nursing homes and to the carceral system rather
than directly to sick, disabled, and mad people, or to the programs we
want, such as in home
support.[24](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-24) Preventable
deaths of high-profile disability activists, such as Carrie Ann Lucas,
attest to the tragic consequences of neoliberal governance, which is
focused more on cutting costs than supporting
life.[25](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-25) How
many other lives have been cut short due to the combination of conjured
crisis, emphasis on cure, organized neglect, and the displacement of
blame onto disabled and mad bodyminds? 

In addition to what has now become almost routine, systematic, premature
death, neoliberalism has increased vulnerability to disaster, especially
in the face of capitalism-induced rapid climate change. [From
supercharged hurricanes to wildfires entering urban spaces, mass death
and injury are the consequence, and disabled and mad bodyminds are at
increased
risk]{.underline}.[26](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-26) As
these disasters show, [government aid for communities made vulnerable to
disasters through neoliberal economic policy is not a realistic
expectation.]{.underline} The rolling power shut-offs orchestrated by
Pacific Gas & Electric company in northern California in the name of
preventing wildfires illustrate that neither local or state governments,
nor the private companies granted authority over critical
infrastructure, take any responsibility for ensuring the safety of
disabled and chronically ill
people.[27](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-27) Further,
[neoliberal governance absolves the state from blame, pointing the
finger on disabled bodyminds ourselves for any suffering and premature
death that results from conditions of precarity.]{.underline} 

[As "situated knowledge" growing out of the experience of precarity,
**[cripistemologies expose how neoliberal governance]{.mark}
simultaneously [creates and deflects responsibility for disabling
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[28](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-28) The
[**perspectives** of racialized and gendered disabled bodyminds
**surviving** **precarity** offers distinctive **[analysis of how
the]{.mark}** twin **[violences of cure and neglect operate]{.mark}
under neoliberal governance**. When **[cripistemological texts
shift]{.mark}** attention **[from the "broken" bodymind to the disabling
structure of neoliberalism]{.mark}, they are [capable of]{.mark}
[undermining]{.mark} the [urgency within which it is claimed that crises
can be solved by state-led, scientifically driven efforts of
cure]{.mark}**. Resisting]{.underline} the temptation [to counter
premature death with calls for increased and expanded state
interventions, cripistemologies are positioned to theorize the routes to
survival and flourishing within and against neoliberalism.]{.underline}
Cripistemologies are forms of what Chela Sandoval names as
"[[**oppositional** **knowledges**]{.mark}"]{.underline} that can

Octavia Butler's novel [Parable of the Sower exemplifies [a
**cripistemological critique of neoliberal
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Butler has a created [a Black femme
protagonist]{.underline} with a disabling impairment. [Devalued
under]{.underline} the terms of [neoliberalism due to her impairment,
racial status, and gender assignment]{.underline}, this protagonist
gains specific knowledge about how to survive disabling precarity.
Further, the character critiques the solutions for crisis proffered by
neoliberal governance---namely, privatization and deregulation that
facilitates medical industrial cure. [In Parable, the Black feminist
cripistemologist protagonist [orchestrates the emergence of a
collective]{.mark} that offers a powerful alternative to reliance on the
eugenicist solutions of the neoliberal state. ]{.underline}

Parable follows Lauren Oya Olamina, a teenager living with her family in
a walled-off community near Los Angeles in the year 2024. Outside of the
neighborhood walls awaits starvation, rape, sexual exploitation,
addiction, and murder. Olamina (as she was called by Butler) lives in a
neighborhood that has banded together to survive by rigging up security
systems, growing food, collecting water, schooling children, and
worshipping together at a makeshift church. When Olamina's family is
murdered and the neighborhood burned down, she forges a new destiny. She
creates a multiracial chosen family that she encourages to walk from Los
Angeles to the far northern part of California, with the promise of
building a more intentional community on more secluded land. 

[[Olamina has]{.underline}]{.mark} a fictional impairment known as
**[[hyperempathy]{.underline}]{.mark}** syndrome, which causes her to
physically feel the pain or pleasure of any person she can see.
[Throughout the novel, [she]{.mark} **[experiences]{.mark} the [gunshot
wounds, sexual violence, and starvation]{.mark}**]{.underline} of others
she encounters. Layered on top of Olamina's [hyperempathy syndrome are
symptoms of what might be diagnosed as]{.underline} post-traumatic
stress syndrome ([PTSD]{.underline}), including symptoms of
hypervigilance and insomnia. However, in her context, some of these PTSD
symptoms are practical assets. Entering debates about whether Olamina's
hyperempathy is a gift or an impairment, Sami Schalk reframes [the
syndrome as a disability given the specific social, political, and
economic context of Olamina's
life.]{.underline}[30](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-30) As
Schalk points out, [even the ability to share pleasure becomes twisted
in the dystopic future that Butler created for Olamina. **[Olamina
suffers from---and]{.mark}**, in several terrifying instances,
**[is]{.mark} completely [debilitated by---her nervous system's response
to witnessing both pain and pleasure.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[One reading of the novel might argue that it is a story about
**[crisis]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and consequently, that it [**[inhabits
the same temporality as neoliberal governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Indeed, Butler intended for the novel to depict the interlocking crises
of the neoliberal present. Butler sought to imagine where ["our current
behaviors and unintended problems might take us," honing in on patterns
in the United States of extreme wealth inequality, the abjection of
low-wage and surplus workers, carceral expansion, disinvestment in
social resources, and the effects of human-caused climate
change.]{.underline}[31](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-31) Of
interest to the present essay are Butler's additional concerns about
pharmaceutical drug abuse and declining access to life-saving medical
treatments. [Both trends are effects of the neoliberal medical
industrial complex that prioritizes profit over life and health---and
the latter trend is a specific crisis for Black women]{.underline}. 

Olamina's impairment, for example, is caused by her mother's abuse
during pregnancy of a fictional drug called Paracetco, so-called
"Einstein
powder."[32](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-32) [**[Mirroring
current real-life conditions]{.mark}** facing pregnant Black people, in
the novel such pharmaceuticals are apparently the only form of
**[medical care readily accessible, while other needs suffer, including
maternal health]{.mark}**. This racialized and gendered neoliberal
contradiction plays out in the text when]{.underline},
[after]{.underline} apparently [causing]{.underline}
[hyperempathy]{.underline} syndrome in her child due to drug use,
**[Olamina's mother dies]{.underline}** during childbirth. In 1993,
when Parable was published, the number of pregnancy-related deaths had
already jumped to 11.1 per 100,000 live births from a low of 7.2 in
1987; the number steadily climbed to 17.3 in
2017.[33](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-33) Olamina's
mother's death represents the specifically racialized dimension of this
problem, as non-Hispanic Black women experienced a pregnancy-related
mortality rate that was almost three times that of non-Hispanic white
women between the years of 2014 and 2017. A participatory research
justice study of Black women's maternal health concluded that numerous
barriers have been erected that prevent Black women from accessing
prenatal care, including "inadequate health insurance coverage,"
"distrust of and poor treatment by prenatal care providers," "structural
inequities" that produce stress that contribute to poor health outcomes,
and "institutional budget constraints" that prevent providers from
offering adequate
care.[34](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-34) Each
of these trends, I argue, can be directly attributed to the ramped up
neoliberalization of medical care in the United States over the past
thirty years. 

Common responses to these disabling conditions are either to cling to
the neoliberal promise of recovery through more privatization and
deregulation leading to market solutions, or to demand a return of
government investment in the social safety
net. [**[Parable rejects]{.mark}** both the **[neoliberal and liberal
impulses, enacting a cripistemologically grounded critique]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} emphatically [resists]{.mark}** the assumption **[that
recovery will come through either more advanced capitalism or state
interventions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the case of market solutions,
Butler imagines the return of an indentured servitude in a kind of
company town, where able-bodied individuals forfeit their freedom to the
corporation in exchange for shelter, food, and protection from outside
violence. In this extreme version of privatization, it is as if the
state does not exist. Consequently, all human value is reduced to the
ability to work, a status that Olamina recognizes as excluding disabled
bodyminds like hers. 

Butler also reminds us that [under neoliberalism, **[the state is
incentivized]{.mark} and disciplined [into accelerating its collusion
with capital, producing]{.mark} [racialized, gendered, and disabled life
as "surplus" through routine forms of
governance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}[35](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-35) Early
in the novel, Butler depicts the election of Charles Morpeth Donner as
President of the United States. [Exemplifying neoliberal logic by
insisting on operating the government like a business, Donner's proposal
for restoring the economy and "putting people back to work" is to
dismantle labor protections and environmental
regulations.]{.underline}[36](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-36) Olamina
wonders, "And what about those suspended laws? **[[Will it be legal to
poison, mutilate, or infect people---as long as you provide them with
food, water, and space to
die?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**[37](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-37) Identifying
how the disablement of citizens occurs in the name of economic profit,
Olamina exposes the fantasy of recovery to something called normal,
organized through the mode of neoliberal governance, as a farce and a
form of what Lauren Berlant calls "cruel
optimism."[38](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-38) 

Yet, exceeding mere critique of the interlocking crises of the
neoliberal present, the novel also presents alternative possible futures
for those who manage to survive neoliberal catastrophe. One other
possible future emerges through collective, community-based emergency
planning spearheaded by the visionary foresight of Olamina. Butler's
protagonist anticipates the need to prepare materially, psychically, and
spiritually for the coming disaster, challenging her parents and other
adults who cling to a restoration of normality. Olamina's differences
from her family and community, differences which include but are not
limited to her impairment and her unorthodox spiritual vision, force her
to grapple with the inadequacy of the status quo for her survival.

[Olamina's impairment has lent her a pessimistic pragmatism forged
through the need to make difficult decisions in order to survive through
the bouts of sudden and debilitating pain that her impairment
brings]{.underline}. Perhaps it is due to these attributes, gained
through impairment, that young Olamina has the ability to push past the
fantasy of normalcy in order to forge an alternative plan for survival.
While her father and other adults in the community worked to shore up
the fences that surround the neighborhood in a desperate bid to maintain
the status quo, Olamina secretly assembled an emergency kit, saved cash,
and studied edible wild foods. Olamina's preparations ultimately save
her life after the neighborhood is attacked, and she is forced to flee
alone on foot. [Olamina's **[anticipation of]{.mark} the
[failure]{.mark} of the status quo [is cripistemological and serves as a
vital model of emergency preparedness for crip collectivities]{.mark}
[facing neoliberal disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is a form of
**[planning based on]{.mark} the crip of color [knowledge
that]{.mark}**, especially in times of crisis, **[there may not
be]{.mark}** any **[government aid]{.mark}** to call upon]{.underline}.
Olamina's example is an invitation to pack emergency kits and make
collective disaster evacuation plans; to vision with our communities
about mutual aid and self-sufficiency; to learn to grow food, harvest
wild food, and make medicine; and to craft ethics and principles that
can guide our collective decision-making outside and beyond the state.
[Although categorized under the genre of speculative fiction or science
fiction, **the text provides an urgent example for [developing practical
plans]{.mark}** to survive the precarious conditions of the neoliberal
present.]{.underline} 

Powerfully, the novel moves beyond strategizing for crip survival to
imagining what Alison Kafer calls "feminist, queer, crip" futures;
futures that have until now largely been absent from eugenicist and
neoliberal sociotechnical
imaginaries.[39](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-39) Similarly,
the Sins Invalid performing arts collective of queer and trans disabled
people of color articulates "disability justice" as a demand for more
than the mere survival of disabled and mad
people.[40](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-40) While
critique offers the barest minimum necessary for the survival of those
devalued under neoliberalism, disability justice also demands a practice
of imagining possible futures where queer and trans disabled and mad
people of color can "flourish," in Sins Invalid collective member's
Patty Berne's
terms.[41](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-41) 

[**[Parable imagines possible futures for those]{.mark}** who have
**been [disabled and made mad]{.mark}** by the precarious conditions of
neoliberalism. The novel depicts more than mere crip survival, **[the
story imagines crip flourishing through the emergence of the
collective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once Olamina is forced from her
domestic space and left with virtually nothing, she cultivates
alternative public arrangements of care and intimacy, building a chosen
family and community. Butler provides the following description of this
collective emergence: 

When Olamina's birth community is destroyed, she begins to build
another. She doesn't know at first that that's what she's doing, and
she's afraid---terrified---of potentially dangerous strangers. But she
learns to reach out in spite of her fear, to choose the best people she
can find and bring them together. With her acceptance of Earthseed, she
relinquishes hope for supernatural help . . . She believes that our only
dependable help must come from ourselves and from one
another.[42](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-42)

Family and community are brought together through Olamina's visionary
creation of an unorthodox spiritual tradition that she calls Earthseed.
Earthseed grows into a multiracial and multigenerational community of
people who have been impaired, traumatized, and dispossessed by the
catastrophe of neoliberal capitalism and abandoned by the neoliberal
state. Together Earthseed as an intentional community defies relegation
to tragedy, creating possible futures for themselves through
interdependence and mutual aid. 

The Earthseed imaginary and the possible futures they create challenge
eugenicist strands within neoliberal narratives. As I have discussed,
neoliberalism structurally creates disabling conditions through
privatization and deregulation, and then continues the eugenicist
tradition of displacing responsibility for structural precarity onto
surplus disabled and mad bodyminds. The Earthseed community resists this
process of disablement, by collectively preparing for changing
conditions, building capacity to adapt to changing conditions, and
indeed, learning how to "shape" inevitable change. Through her depiction
of Earthseed, Butler depicts how **[[building collective]{.mark} crip
[resilience]{.mark} offers a path [for surviving within neoliberalist
precarity and creating flourishing futures for those]{.mark} that would
[otherwise be devalued under the neoliberal status
quo.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

I have argued that as a cripistemological fiction, Octavia Butler's 1993
novel Parable of the Sower imagines the [possibilities for [crip
flourishing through collective emergence]{.mark} within and against
neoliberal precarity.]{.underline} While this parable about crip life
beyond the state is generative, I recognize [that it is difficult to
imagine how to meet the need for modern technologies to keep disabled
and mad people alive outside of the market and state
models.]{.underline} Currently, the state seems like the best---although
not necessarily the only---way to enforce access and to distribute
life-saving services and
technologies.[43](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-43) [It]{.underline}
[may]{.underline} therefore [seem counterintuitive to conclude that a
future of crip thriving and flourishing is only possible through a
critical perspective of neoliberal modes of state
governance]{.underline}. Yet [**[without devoting energies to]{.mark}**
creating lifesaving **[services and technologies beyond the
state]{.mark}** apparatus, **[disabled and mad people]{.mark} will be
[stuck in an endless precarious neoliberal]{.mark} [loop of]{.mark}
[crisis, cure, neglect, and scapegoating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
disaster that opens Parable predicts that [**[the neoliberal state
is]{.mark} always already [imploding under the weight of]{.mark}
[problems it helped to create]{.mark}**, including **[urban
divestment]{.mark}**, **[wealth inequality]{.mark}**, and **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the real-life versions of similar
disasters have demonstrated, the most acute effect of neoliberal
precarity is on racialized communities, on women and gender diverse
people within those communities, and on disabled and mad
people.[44](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-44) The
need to think outside the state is not just speculation---[racialized
and gendered crip communities are always necessarily creating their own
terms of survival and developing communities of flourishing beyond the
neoliberal
state.]{.underline}[45](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-45)

Such community has emerged among readers of Parable. Readers and
scholars of Butler gather digitally, physically, and intellectually,
through the creation of such infrastructures as Wildseeds: New Orleans
Octavia Butler Emergent Strategy Collective (co-founded by Desiree Evans
and Soraya Jean-Louis McElroy), Emergent Strategy Ideation Institute
(founded by adrienne maree brown), and the Octavia Butler Legacy Network
(founded by Ayana A.H.
Jamieson).[46](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-46) In
these communities, [Butler's work is treated as a
pedagogical]{.underline}, at times sacred, [text containing much needed
wisdom about survival, healing, and creating a future where communities
of color, women, and gender diverse people can flourish. **[These
communities]{.mark} are** an example of the kinds of **collective
emergence that [can be scaled up from]{.mark}** the imaginary [of
**speculative fiction into the**]{.mark} level of the **[material
world]{.mark}.** ]{.underline}

If, as I join others in insisting, Butler's fiction is a
cripistemological text, then [Parable contains knowledge precisely for
developing networks of mutual aid through which crip and mad people,
specifically, can survive and
flourish.[47](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-47) **Parable offers
a critique of neoliberalism**, **an essential imaginary of "feminist,
queer, crip" "flourishing"**]{.underline} (in Kafer's and Berne's
terms), and, finally, operates as a foundation for real-life community
building, as Butler's readers and scholars connect digitally and in
person.[48](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-48) This
last is an example of putting speculative fiction as theory into
"practice" in a whole new way. [Disabled and mad people in the real
world currently face the kinds of rapid climate change catastrophe and
abandonment by the neoliberal state presciently imagined by Octavia
Butler in Parable of the Sower. **[Collective crip]{.mark} [emergence as
praxis, facilitated through]{.mark}** the gathering of **[speculative
fiction readers, is]{.mark}** an [**urgent** and **timely**]{.mark}
practice [for realizing futures]{.mark} for crip and mad
people.]{.underline}
