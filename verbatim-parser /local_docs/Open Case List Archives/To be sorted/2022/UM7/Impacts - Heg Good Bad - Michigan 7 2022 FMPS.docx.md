ACTION AND REACTION

As China burns down what remains of the liberal order, it is sparking an
international backlash. [Negative views of the country have soared
around the world to highs not seen since the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre. A 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that roughly 75
percent of people in the United States, Europe, and Asia held
unfavorable views of China and had no confidence that President Xi
Jinping would behave responsibly in world affairs or respect human
rights]{.underline}. Another survey, a 2020 poll by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, revealed that about [75 percent of
foreign policy elites in those same places thought that the best way to
deal with China was to form coalitions of like-minded countries against
it.]{.underline} In the United States, [both political parties now
support a tough policy toward China]{.underline}. The [EU has officially
declared China to be a "systemic rival]{.underline}." In Asia, [Beijing
faces openly hostile governments in every direction, from Japan to
Australia to Vietnam to India. Even people in countries that trade
heavily with China are souring on it.]{.underline} Surveys show that
South Koreans, for example, now dislike China more than they dislike
Japan, their former colonial overlord.

[Anti-Chinese sentiment is starting to congeal into concrete pushback.
The resistance remains embryonic and patchy, mainly because so many
countries are still hooked on Chinese trade]{.underline}. But the
overall trend is clear: disparate actors are starting to join forces to
roll back Beijing's power. In the process, they are reordering the
world.

[The Chinese threat could usher in the most consequential changes to
global governance in a generation.]{.underline}

The e[merging anti-Chinese order departs fundamentally from the liberal
order, because it is directed at a different threat. In particular, the
new order flips the relative emphasis placed on capitalism versus
democracy.]{.underline} During the Cold War, the old liberal order
promoted capitalism first and democracy a distant second. The United
States and its allies pushed free markets as far as their power could
reach, but when forced to choose, they almost always supported
right-wing autocrats over left-wing democrats. The so-called free world
was mainly an economic construct. Even after the Cold War, when
democracy promotion became a cottage industry in Western capitals, the
United States and its allies often shelved human rights concerns to gain
market access, as they did most notably by ushering China into the WTO.

But now [economic openness has become a liability for the United States
and its allies, because China is ensconced in virtually every aspect of
the liberal order.]{.underline} Far from being put out of business by
globalization, [China's authoritarian capitalist system seems almost
perfectly designed to milk free markets for mercantilist
gain]{.underline}. [Beijing uses subsidies and espionage to help its
firms dominate global markets]{.underline} and protects its domestic
market with nontariff barriers. [It censors foreign ideas and companies
on its own internet and freely accesses the global Internet to steal
intellectual property and spread CCP propaganda.]{.underline} It
[assumes leadership positions in liberal international institutions,
such as the UN Human Rights Council, and then bends them in an illiberal
direction]{.underline}. It [enjoys secure shipping around the globe for
its export machine,]{.underline} courtesy of the U.S. Navy, [and uses
its own military to assert control over large swaths of the East China
and South China Seas]{.underline}.

[The United States and its allies have awoken to the danger: the liberal
order and, in particular, the globalized economy at its heart are
empowering a dangerous adversary. In response, they are trying to build
a new order that excludes China by making democracy a requirement for
full membership.]{.underline} [When U.S. President Joe
Biden]{.underline} gave his first press conference, in March 2021, and
[described the U.S.-Chinese rivalry as part of a broader competition
between democracy and autocracy, it wasn't a rhetorical flourish. He was
drawing a battle line]{.underline} based on a widely shared belief that
[authoritarian capitalism poses a **mortal threat** to the democratic
world, one that can't be contained by the liberal order]{.underline}.
Instead of reforming existing rules, [rich democracies are starting to
impose new ones by banding together, adopting progressive standards and
practices, and threatening to exclude countries that don't follow
them]{.underline}. [Democracies aren't merely balancing against
China---increasing their defense spending and forming military
alliances---they are also reordering the world around it.]{.underline}

#### Deterrence and promotion of the US-led LIO is key to contain Chinese expansionism

**Beckley 22** -- *Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, associate professor at Tufts University* (Michael,

The [second feature of the emerging order is a double military barrier
to contain China]{.underline}. The [inside layer consists of rivals
bordering the East China and South China Seas.]{.underline} Many of
them---[including Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and
Vietnam---are loading up on mobile missile launchers and
mines]{.underline}. The goal is to turn themselves into [prickly
porcupines capable of denying China sea and air control near their
shores]{.underline}. Those [efforts are now being bolstered by an
outside layer]{.underline} of democratic powers---mainly [Australia,
India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.]{.underline} These
democracies are [providing aid, arms, and intelligence to China's
neighbors; training togethe]{.underline}r so they can conduct long-range
missile strikes on Chinese forces [and blockade China's oil imports; and
organizing multinational freedom-of-navigation exercises]{.underline}
throughout the region, especially near Chinese-held rocks, reefs, and
islands in disputed areas.

This [security cooperation is becoming stronger and more
institutionalized]{.underline}. Witness the [reemergence of the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad---a coalition made up of
Australia, India, Japan, and the United States]{.underline} that had
gone dormant shortly after its founding in 2007. Or look at [the
creation of new pacts, most notably AUKUS, an alliance linking
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States]{.underline}. [The
overarching goal]{.underline} of all this activity [is to maintain the
territorial status quo in East Asia.]{.underline} But a more [explicit
aim is to save Taiwan, the frontline democracy most at risk of Chinese
conquest]{.underline}. Ja[pan and the United States have developed a
joint battle plan for defending the island]{.underline}, and in November
2021, Peter Dutton, Australia's defense minister, said it was
"inconceivable" that his country would not also join the fight. The
European Parliament, for its part, has adopted a comprehensive plan to
boost Taiwan's economic resilience and international recognition.

Viewed individually, [these efforts]{.underline} look haphazard and
reactive. Collectively, however, they [betray a positive vision for a
democratic order, one that differs fundamentally from China's
mercantilist model and also from the old international
order]{.underline}, with neoliberal orthodoxy at its core. [By infusing
labor and human rights standards into economic agreements, the new
vision prioritizes people over corporate profits and state
power]{.underline}. It also elevates the global environment from a mere
commodity to a shared and jointly protected commons. [By linking
democratic governments together in an exclusive network, the new order
attempts to force countries to make a series of value judgments and
imposes real penalties for illiberal behavior]{.underline}. Want to make
carbon-intensive steel with slave labor? Prepare to be hit with tariffs
by the world's richest countries. [Considering annexing international
waters? Expect a visit from a multinational armada.]{.underline}

[If China continues to scare democracies into collective action, then it
could usher in the most consequential changes to global governance in a
generation]{.underline} or more. [By containing Chinese naval expansion,
for example, the maritime security system in East Asia could become a
powerful enforcement mechanism for the law of the sea]{.underline}. By
inserting carbon tariffs into trade deals to discriminate against China,
the United States and its allies could force producers to reduce their
emissions, inadvertently creating the basis for a de facto international
carbon tax. [The Quad's success in providing one billion doses of
COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asia, an effort to win hearts and minds
away from Beijing, has provided a blueprint for combating future
pandemics]{.underline}. Allied efforts to prevent the spread of digital
authoritarianism could inspire new international regulations on digital
flows and data privacy, and the imperative of competing with China could
fuel an unprecedented surge in R & D and infrastructure spending around
the world.

Like the orders of the past, [the emerging one is an order of exclusion,
sustained by fear and enforced through coercion. Unlike most past
orders, however, it is directed toward progressive ends.]{.underline}

#### Democracy promotion and competition with China is the only route to saving the LIO!

DOUBLING DOWN ON DEMOCRACY

History shows that [eras of fluid multipolarity typically end in
disaster, regardless of the bright ideas or advanced technologies
circulating at the time]{.underline}. The [late eighteenth century
witnessed the pinnacle of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the
continent descended into the hell of the Napoleonic Wars.]{.underline}
At the start of the twentieth century, the [world's sharpest minds
predicted an end to great-power conflict as railways, telegraph cables,
and steamships linked countries closer together]{.underline}. The worst
war in history up to that point quickly followed. The sad and
paradoxical reality is that [international orders are vital to avert
chaos, yet they typically emerge only during periods of great-power
rivalry. Competing with China will be fraught with risk for the United
States and its allies, but it might be the only way to avoid even
greater dangers.]{.underline}

To build a better future, the United States and its allies will need to
take a more enlightened view of their interests than they did even
during the Cold War. Back then, their economic interests dovetailed
nicely with their geopolitical interests. Simple greed, if nothing else,
could compel capitalist states to band together to protect private
property against a communist onslaught. Now, however, the choice is not
so simple, because [standing up to China will entail significant
economic costs, especially in the short term. Those costs might pale in
comparison to the long-term costs of business as usual with
Beijing---Chinese espionage has been estimated to deprive the United
States alone of somewhere between \$200 billion and \$600 billion
annually]{.underline}---[to say nothing of the moral quandaries and
geopolitical risks of cooperating with a brutal totalitarian regime with
revanchist ambitions]{.underline}. Yet the ability to make such an
enlightened calculation in favor of confronting China may be beyond the
capacities of any nation, especially ones as polarized as the United
States and many of its democratic allies.

I[f there is any hope, it lies in a renewed commitment to democratic
values. The United States and its allies share a common aspiration for
an international order based on democratic principles and enshrined in
international agreements and laws.]{.underline} The [core of such an
order is being forged in the crucible of competition with China and
could be built out into the most enlightened order the world has ever
seen---a genuine free world]{.underline}. But to get there, [the United
States and its allies will have to embrace competition with
China]{.underline} and march forward together through another long
twilight struggle.

#### Short-term moves to bolster heg are key to check China's rapid rise

A Strategy for Navigating the Danger Zone

[The United States obviously needs a long-term strategy to stay ahead of
China economically, mili-tarily, and diplomatically]{.underline} over
the coming decades. But [the more urgent task is to develop a short-term
strategy to blunt a potential surge of Chinese aggres-sion and expansion
this decade.]{.underline}

A useful parallel is the early Cold War. The logic of the containment
strategy Washington adopted in the late 1940s was that the contest with
Moscow would last many years, so America must set a course it could
patiently follow. Yet winning the Cold War over the long term required
not losing it in the short term. The Marshall Plan, unveiled in 1947,
was meant to prevent an imminent economic collapse in Western Europe,
which might enable Moscow to extend its political hegemony over the
entire continent. The creation of NATO and the rearm-ament program
undertaken during the Korean War were crisis-driven efforts to forge a
military shield that would allow the West to thrive\--and containment to
work\--over time. Strategic urgency was the prelude to strategic
patience: America could exploit its lasting economic and political
advantages only if it closed off more immediate, and potentially fatal,
vulnerabilities./22 Today, the United States will once again need a
danger-zone strategy, which should be based on four principles.

America should focus on denying China near-term successes, military or
otherwise, that would significantly alter the longer-term balance of
power.

[First, America should focus on denying China near-term successes,
military or otherwise, that would significantly alter the longer-term
balance of power]{.underline}. The possibilities [of greatest concern
are a Chinese conquest of Taiwan, which would fundamentally upend the
strategic equilibrium in the western Pacific, and Chinese technological
breakthroughs-]{.underline}-such as preeminence in 5G telecommunications
networks\--[that would deliver lasting dividends in economic power and
geopolitical influence.]{.underline}

[This isn\'t to say that Washington should cede the field in other areas
of competition\--such as in the struggle for influence in international
organizations]{.underline}\--but [simply to recognize that strict
prioritization is vital when dangers are acute and resources are
limited. In]{.underline} fact, a danger-zone strategy may involve
reacting calmly to, or even encouraging, some Chinese ini-tiatives as a
way to channel China\'s attention and resources in less threatening
directions. If Beijing wants to spend lavishly on white elephant
projects in Pakistan or other detours along the Belt and Road, or if it
invests in global power-projection capabilities that will take decades
to have a strategic impact, so much the better.

Second[, because a danger-zone strategy is a race against the clock, it
rewards good-enough solutions rather than perfect ones.]{.underline}
Whether in the military, diplomatic, or economic realm, [the United
States should make the most of tools, partners, and coalitions it has
now, or can quickly summon, rather than assets that would require years
or longer to develop.]{.underline}

Third[, a danger-zone strategy requires slowing down one\'s opponent and
speeding up one\'s own efforts]{.underline}. As the Chinese challenge
sharpens in the coming years, [Washington must selectively degrade
Beijing\'s capabilities and enthusiasm for expansion. This does not mean
waging all-out economic or political warfare against an insecure
regime.]{.underline} As dis-cussed subsequently, [it means identifying
discrete areas where applying pressure can throw Beijing off-balance or
complicate its geopolitical designs.]{.underline}

Finally, [a danger-zone strategy requires risk-taking. The United States
must be willing to actively roll back Chinese power and limit its
potential for aggression]{.underline}. As Dean Acheson remarked of
desperate US efforts to rearm during the Korean War, \"The only thing
that was more dangerous than undertaking this program was not
undertaking it.\"/[23 But US officials should also eschew superfluous
provocations, keeping their rhetoric calm and measured, and avoid
creating the impression that Washington is bent on all-out
confrontation. Navigating a perilous passage will require blending
strength, pressure, and reassurance.]{.underline}

### Now key

#### Now is critical for a US heg booster! Post-Ukraine encouraged international collaboration and Western leadership

**Daalder and Lindsay 22** - *\*President of the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs and served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013,
\*\*Senior Vice President and Director of Studies at the Council on
Foreign Relations.* (\*Ivo H. and \*\*James M., July/August 2022, \"Last

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine confirmed what has long been apparent: the
rules-based order created after World War II is at risk of collapse.
Russia is not content to be a responsible stakeholder in a system set up
by others, and neither is China,]{.underline} which has supported
Moscow's aggression. [Both countries want to remake the order to serve
their autocratic interests]{.underline}. As U.S. President Joe Biden
said in Warsaw in March, [the West now faces "a battle between democracy
and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based
order and one governed by brute force]{.underline}."

History was not supposed to play out this way. In the heady days after
the Cold War, the order appeared both unchallenged and unchallengeable.
Washington believed that its unquestioned primacy allowed it to
determine the future of other countries as well as its own. U.S. allies
believed they had escaped the tragedy of great-power politics and had
entered an era of self-enforcing rules. As time went on, however,
[habits of collaboration eroded, and the sense of common purpose faded.
Rather than using the unique moment of U.S. dominance to deepen and
strengthen the rules-based order, the West let that system
wither]{.underline}.

[Washington and its allies now have a chance to correct that
mistake.]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin's historic
miscalculation to attack Ukraine has reminded them not just of their
shared interests and values but also of the importance of acting
collectively]{.underline}. [The West responded to the invasion with a
show of unity not seen since the height of the Cold War. The United
States and its allies have levied unprecedented sanctions, begun weaning
themselves off Russian energy, and shipped massive quantities of weapons
to Ukraine]{.underline}. But this surprising unity may not last. As the
economic pain of sanctions increases and the war settles into the
prolonged battle of attrition that intelligence officials forecast,
domestic and other concerns may start to sow divisions within the West.

Even as the West works to manage these differences, it should turn its
newfound unity into a broader effort to save the rules-based order. The
first step should be to create a new group, the G-12, that would bring
together the United States and its leading allies in Asia, Europe, and
North America. Every member of this group has a vital interest in
preserving the order, and none of them can do it on their own. But
[formalized cooperation alone will not be enough. The United States and
its allies will need to take the second step of learning from the
mistakes they had made over the last three decades. Washington will need
to curtail its penchant for unilateralism, to listen as well as talk,
and to give as well as demand.]{.underline} Asian and European allies,
for their part, will need to accept more responsibility and overcome
their tendency to free-ride.

If the [West sticks to its old ways, it will bungle something that is
exceedingly rare in international politics: a second chance. Only by
seizing the moment, learning from its errors, and acting collectively
can the West rebuild an international order that promotes the rule of
law rather than the law of the jungle.]{.underline}

#### COVID created a hegemonic reset with a global-power step down -- now is a rare gap to positively reconstruct the world order

**Zelikow 22** - *Professor of History at the University of Virginia. A
former U.S. diplomat and Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, he
has worked for five presidential administrations* (Philip, July/August
2022, \"The Hollow Order,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-06-21/hollow-order-international-system)//KH

There they were, meeting in Beijing on February 4: Chinese President Xi
Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Shortly before the start
of the 2022 Winter Olympics, the two leaders released a remarkable
5,300-word joint statement about how the partnership between China and
Russia would have "no limits." The document went on at length about the
two nations' commitment to democracy. It called for a universalist and
open world order, with the United Nations at the center. It stressed a
commitment to international law, inclusiveness, and common values. It
did all this even though Russia, as Xi and Putin both knew, was sending
tanks and missile launchers to the Ukrainian border[.]{.underline}

By comparison, the September 1940 joint statement issued by Germany,
Italy, and Japan was a model of candor. The Axis powers were at least
truthful when they announced that it was "their prime purpose to
establish and maintain a new order of things." Russia, meanwhile, has
described its war against Ukraine as one of liberation. It decided that
the country's Jewish president was a Nazi. It declared that there was
really no such thing as "Ukraine." And it argued that a NATO alliance
with a U.S. force commitment in Europe that was only one-seventh as
large as it had been at the height of the Cold War was now an
existential threat[.]{.underline}

In their statement, China and Russia achieved peak hypocrisy. [But the
existing world order, which aspired to build a global commonwealth, had
already been failing. The free world's leaders had long ago started
favoring performative commitments over the real action needed to
safeguard the planet from crises. They expanded NATO without
meaningfully responding to increasing Russian aggression. Distracted and
chastened by misadventures in the Muslim world, Washington in particular
disengaged from practical deeds, even as its rhetorical commitment to
the international order varied.]{.underline} The [United States' high
defense spending had more to do with satisfying domestic
constituencies]{.underline} than with supporting any positive strategy.
[The world's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources
was based on hollow pledges and private action]{.underline}. As support
for globalization waned, [the United States and other countries
retreated from trade agreements and neglected international institutions
for civilian and common economic action. The world's drive in the early
years of this century to improve global health and human development
petered out]{.underline}.

The [emptiness of the supposed international system was especially
obvious]{.underline} at the end of 2019, [when the COVID-19 pandemic
broke out.]{.underline} Charged with unprecedented global
responsibilities, [China and the United States stepped down, not up.
Beijing withheld crucial information]{.underline} about the outbreak.
[Washington withdrew from the World Health Organization just when it
most needed U.S. leadership.]{.underline} Wealthy countries began a mad
scramble to develop vaccines, but they moved too slowly to create other
treatments and hoarded whatever shots and therapeutics pharmaceutical
companies could produce, leaving the rest of the world behind. The best
estimates suggest that the virus caused about 15 to 20 million deaths
and trillions of dollars of economic damage.

The most powerful idealism has usually been the idealism of what works.

[By the spring of 2020, "for all practical purposes the G7 ceased to
exist,"]{.underline} wrote the foreign policy experts Colin Kahl and
Thomas Wright in August 2021. "[Pandemic politics," they continued,
"ultimately dealt the final blow to the old international
order."]{.underline}

Six months after they published those words, Russia invaded Ukraine. It
was an attack that could truly have buried the old system, as Moscow
believed it would. Yet [Ukraine's inspiring fight has helped the G-7
roar back to life. Its members have organized an economic
counteroffensive, and they have joined a coalition providing military
aid. Amid the wreckage of so many past hopes, it is possible to imagine
a reconstructed world order emerging from this crisis]{.underline}.

But [for a new system to succeed, its would-be architects must organize
actions, not more theatrics]{.underline}. Over the course of world
history, the most powerful idealism has usually been the idealism of
what works. [Today, that means crafting a practical international order
focused on a few basic problems that rally broad interest]{.underline}.
Many [leaders want to stop unprovoked wars of aggression, especially
those that might spark **a third world war.**]{.underline} They would
welcome a new vision of economic order that does not ignore security but
is also not a huckster's promise that everything can be made at home.
They would [like to convert jolting energy shocks, such as the one
caused by Russia's invasion, into a managed transition to a more
carbon-free future]{.underline}. They [want to be better prepared for
the next pandemic]{.underline}. And most world leaders, and even many
ordinary Americans, [still hope that China will choose to be part of
these solutions, not one of the wreckers of a new international
system.]{.underline}

These aspirations may seem modest. They do not include holding war
crimes trials or spreading democracy. But effective common action on
just these items will be an enormous task. [The world order is
deglobalizing and dysfunctional, facing challenges that have never been
more planetary in scope. Leaders must craft a system focused on actually
addressing these issues rather than on striking the right
pose.]{.underline}

### Reps defense

#### Benevolent hegemonic offensive rhetoric is key -- otherwise, worse, anti-democratic rhetoric fills in

War for China Strategy Today," Center for Strategic and International

https://www.csis.org/analysis/twilight-struggle-lessons-cold-war-china-strategy-today)//KH

Mike Green: So the way you write the book is looking at different themes
in Cold War strategic competition and then, at the end of the book,
tying together some lessons or implications for us. You don\'t come out
and say, \"We need to recreate exactly NSC-68, or we need\"\... It\'s
not redo what we did but what are the implications for how we prepare
for this ourselves? There is a bit of a contradiction in there, which
may be something you can resolve for us. But, on the one hand, you want
an open educational exchange with China, for all the reasons you just
said, but you also quote\... And I agree with this, too, by the way.
[You quote Kennan on the need for offensive, not just defensive, but
offensive political warfare, information warfare, so poking at the
seams, the inconsistencies, the contradictions in the adversary\'s way
of life.]{.underline}

Mike Green: The contradiction is this. [This is the excuse Xi Jinping
and other authoritarians used to shut down civil society and free
academic learning and discourse]{.underline}, because it\'s all just
part of an American campaign of offensive political warfare. This is a
kind of tactical question, really. I don\'t think we ever figured it out
in the Cold War, really. [How do you take advantage of our open society,
the attraction of our values, even within an authoritarian state, and
therefore wanting to preserve an open exchange in academic and
intellectual,]{.underline} rich [interaction with China while at the
same time engaging in political warfare,]{.underline} which we need to
do? Do you have any sort of lessons from the Cold War or thoughts on the
way forward?

Hal Brands: Well, the framing point here is that [when Kennan and others
thought about political warfare early in the Cold Wa]{.underline}r, I
think they were motivated chiefly by the idea that [the Soviet Union
certainly isn\'t going to hold back from trying to divide and weaken our
society and pry us apart from our friends and allies, and so if we limit
ourselves to purely defensive measures, that\'s a form of unilateral
disarmament in this struggle]{.underline}. Since the struggle is really,
hopefully, going to be waged using primarily means short of war,
[that\'s a part of the toolkit you just can\'t leave to the side in a
competition like this]{.underline}. I think that\'s basically right
today as well. I think it\'s fairly well established the [Chinese have a
pretty well-developed program of political warfare that they pursue
vis-a-vis not just the United States but other democratic societies
that\'s meant to make it harder for us to be an effective
competitor]{.underline}. So I think we\'re going to have to do things in
the same area.

Hal Brands: The point I would make, though, is that you [don\'t always
have to think of political warfare as the really sexy covert action,
dangerous type stuff]{.underline} that it sometimes gets described as.
So [we did a lot of political warfare during the Cold War that frankly
wasn\'t that effective, right? We would parachute Albanian exiles back
into Albania to try to link up with the anti-Communist resistance
there]{.underline}, and they all got killed because Kim Philby had
infiltrated British and American intelligence service. [We trained
Tibetan guerillas to go fight against the Chinese communists and they
pretty much all got killed as well]{.underline}. So those types of
things weren\'t always the most effective forms of political warfare.
[Some of the most effective forms of political warfare could be things
like finding ways of introducing unbiased information into an otherwise
closed information ecosystem.]{.underline} [We used Radio Free
Europe]{.underline}, for instance, to do this during the Cold War. There
are paral[lels today that would come with finding ways of circumventing
the Great Firewall]{.underline} and things like that. Political warfare
can also be, you know, sort of a synonym for standing up for your own
best values abroad.

Hal Brands: I mean, [when the United States gets together with other
democratic allies to sanction Chinese officials who are involved in
doing terrible things to the Uighur population, that\'s a form of
political warfare. It strikes at the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist
Party]{.underline}, particularly under Xi Jinping. But it\'s something
that we ought to be doing simply to validate our own values as well, and
so I think we need kind of a broad version or a broad vision of
political warfare, one that is not entirely constituted by, sort of,
sneaky and subversive acts. I think we just have to accept the tension
as well. I don\'t think there\'s anything the United States can do, by
the way, that would convince Xi Jinping that we are not trying to
overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. It\'s not just Xi, by the way.
Deng Xiaoping thought that the United States was trying to overthrow the
Chinese Communist Party as well back in the 1980s when that was
basically the last thing that we had in mind. So there is a degree of
ingrained suspicion here that we\'re not going to be able to overcome.

Mike Green: So the political warfare, the offensive\... It\'s
unfortunate the word warfare goes with it, but the offensive tool that
works best for us is our openness and just, as you said, getting rid of
the firewalls, opening up information. I went to college during the Cold
War, so I remember it. I ran our radio station, and we used to get the
weekly world news from Radio Moscow, and they\'d encourage us to play
it. We\'d play it with a laugh track. It was so ridiculous. It was
propaganda, and we knew, and it was funny. It was like a drinking game.

Mike Green: After college, I took the Trans-Siberian Railroad from China
through the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, which made for interesting
security clearance interviews a few years later. The most [effective
piece of American political warfare I saw behind the Iron Curtain was
outside the US Embassy in Warsaw, where they had a huge placard with
Herblock cartoons making fun of Ronald Reagan]{.underline} and dozens
and [dozens of Poles just staring at it in amazement. \"You mean you\'re
allowed to make fun of your leader?]{.underline}\" So I think that\'s
what political warfare meant, probably what Kennan had in mind, too.
[Don\'t emulate the other side. Play to your own strengths, which is
openness, information, challenging conventional wisdom]{.underline}, and
all of that.

### Sustainability

#### The threat of Chinese revisionism has increased US hegemonic sustainability

**Beckley 22** -- *Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, associate professor at Tufts University* (Michael,
March/April 2022, \"Enemies of My Enemy,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2021-02-14/china-new-world-order-enemies-my-enemy)//KH

[The international order is falling apart,]{.underline} and everyone
seems to know how to fix it. According to some, the United States just
needs to rededicate itself to leading the liberal order it helped found
some 75 years ago[. Others argue that the world's great powers should
form a concert to guide the international community into a new age of
multipolar cooperation]{.underline}. Still [others call for a grand
bargain that divides the globe into stable spheres of influence. What
these and other visions of international order have in common is an
assumption that global governance can be designed and imposed from the
top down.]{.underline} With wise statesmanship and ample summitry, the
international jungle can be tamed and cultivated. Conflicts of interest
and historical hatreds can be negotiated away and replaced with win-win
cooperation.

[The history of international order, however, provides little reason for
confidence in top-down, cooperative solutions.]{.underline} The
[strongest orders in modern history]{.underline}---from Westphalia in
the seventeenth century to the liberal international order in the
twentieth---[were not inclusive organizations working for the greater
good of humanity. Rather, they were alliances built by great powers to
wage security competition against their main rivals]{.underline}. [Fear
and loathing of a shared enemy, not enlightened calls to make the world
a better place, brought these orders together]{.underline}.
[Progress]{.underline} on transnational issues, when achieved, [emerged
largely as a byproduct of hardheaded security cooperation]{.underline}.
That [cooperation usually lasted only as long as a common threat
remained both present and manageable]{.underline}. When that threat
dissipated or grew too large, the orders collapsed. Today, [the liberal
order is fraying for many reasons]{.underline}, but the underlying cause
is that [the threat it was originally designed to defeat---Soviet
communism---disappeared three decades ago.]{.underline} None of the
proposed replacements to the current order have stuck because there
hasn't been a threat scary or vivid enough to compel sustained
cooperation among the key players.

[Until now. Through a surge of repression and aggression, China has
frightened countries near and far.]{.underline} It is [acting
belligerently in East Asia, trying to carve out exclusive economic zones
in the global economy, and exporting digital systems that make
authoritarianism more effective than ever]{.underline}. For the first
time since the Cold War, [a critical mass of countries face serious
threats to their security, welfare, and ways of life---all emanating
from a single source.]{.underline}

This moment of clarity has triggered a flurry of responses. [China's
neighbors are arming themselves and aligning with outside powers to
secure their territory and sea-lanes]{.underline}. Many of the [world's
largest economies are collectively developing new trade, investment, and
technology standards that implicitly discriminate against
China]{.underline}. Democracies are gathering to devise strategies for
combating authoritarianism at home and abroad, and new international
organizations are popping up to coordinate the battle. Seen in real
time, these efforts look scattershot. Step back from the day-to-day
commotion, however, and a fuller picture emerges: for better or worse,
competition with China is forging a new international order.

ORDERS OF EXCLUSION

[The modern liberal mind associates international order with peace and
harmony.]{.underline} Historically, however, [international orders have
been more about keeping rivals down than bringing everyone
together.]{.underline} As the international relations theorist Kyle
Lascurettes has argued, t[he major orders of the past four centuries
were "orders of exclusion," designed by dominant powers to ostracize and
outcompete rivals. Order building wasn't a restraint on geopolitical
conflict; it was power politics by other means, a cost-effective way to
contain adversaries short of war.]{.underline}

Fear of an enemy, not faith in friends, formed the bedrock of each era's
order, and members developed a common set of norms by defining
themselves in opposition to that enemy. In doing so, they tapped into
humanity's most primordial driver of collective action. Sociologists
call it "the in-group/out-group dynamic." Philosophers call it
"Sallust's theorem," after the ancient historian who argued that fear of
Carthage held the Roman Republic together. In political science, [the
analogous concept is negative partisanship, the tendency for voters to
become intensely loyal to one political party mainly because they
despise its rival.]{.underline}

For the first time since the Cold War, [a critical mass of countries
face serious threats to their security, welfare, and ways of
life.]{.underline}

This negative dynamic pervades the history of order building. In 1648,
the kingdoms that won the Thirty Years' War enshrined rules of sovereign
statehood in the Peace of Westphalia to undermine the authority of the
Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. Great Britain and its allies
designed the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht to contain France by delegitimizing
territorial expansion through royal marriages and the assertion of
dynastic ties, Louis XIV's preferred method of amassing power. The
Concert of Europe, the post-Napoleonic peace established in Vienna in
1815, was used by conservative monarchies to forestall the rise of
liberal revolutionary regimes. The victors of World War I built the
interwar order to hold Germany and Bolshevik Russia in check. After
World War II, the Allies initially designed a global order, centered on
the United Nations, to prevent a return of Nazi-style fascism and
mercantilism. When the onset of the Cold War quickly hamstrung that
global order, however, the West created a separate order to exclude and
outcompete Soviet communism. For the duration of the Cold War, the world
was divided into two orders: the dominant one led by Washington, and a
poorer one centered on Moscow.

The main features of today's liberal order are direct descendants of the
United States' Cold War alliance. After the Soviets decided not to join
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (gatt), these institutions were
repurposed as agents of capitalist expansion---first, to rebuild
capitalist economies and, later, to promote globalization. The Marshall
Plan laid the foundation for the European Community by lavishing U.S.
aid on governments that agreed to expel communists from their ranks and
work toward an economic federation. NATO created a united front against
the Red Army. The chain of U.S. alliances ringing East Asia was
constructed to contain communist expansion there, especially from China
and North Korea. U.S. engagement with China, which lasted from the 1970s
to the 2010s, was a gambit to exploit the Sino-Soviet split.

Each of these initiatives was an element of an order designed first and
foremost to defeat the Soviet Union. In the absence of the Cold War
threat, Japan and West Germany would not have tolerated prolonged U.S.
military occupations on their soil. [The British, the French, and the
Germans would not have pooled their industrial resources.]{.underline}
[The United States---]{.underline}which had spent the previous two
centuries ducking international commitments and shielding its economy
with tariffs---[would not have thrown its weight behind international
institutions]{.underline}. Nor would it have provided security
guarantees, massive aid, and easy market access to dozens of countries,
including the former Axis powers. [Only the threat of a nuclear-armed,
communist superpower could compel so many countries to set aside their
conflicting interests and long-standing rivalries and build the
strongest security community and free-trade regime in
history.]{.underline}

#### States' reaction to multiple spheres of influence proves a regional shift away from Chinese revisionism and towards the USA!

Mike Green: You have a whole chapter on the contest and the periphery,
and there was a great\... The [Soviets and the Chinese had an advantage
because, for example, the fight in the Korean Peninsula or Vietnam was a
continental Asian fight]{.underline}. They had interior lines. We had to
go across the vast maritime space, and we ended up getting sucked into
continental wars. The peripheral problems this time, with a few
exceptions, are maritime. T[hat\'s different, isn\'t it? It\'s South
China Sea, it\'s East China Sea. It\'s increasingly not only the first
but the second island chain. It\'s closer to home, and it\'s sort of
more vital in the sense of American sea lanes and the, if you will,
Anglo-American source of hegemony for 400 years.]{.underline} How do we
think about these peripheral risks and which ones worry you, like
Taiwan?

Mike Green: Riffing off what I just said, to me, it sort of says,
\"Worry more about the maritime periphery than the continental.\" But
how do we think about these peripheral challenges? We\'re not looking at
a direct US-China fight. [It\'s about the periphery. It\'s about third
states. It\'s about spheres of influence]{.underline} and all
that[.]{.underline} How do you think about it? What are the ones that
worry you, and what does it mean that it\'s now increasingly maritime
and, therefore, in our face?

Hal Brands: So I think there\'s maybe at least three ways of thinking
about this issue, and so one area that I worry about is the one that you
flagged, which is basically the maritime periphery of East Asia, right?
[You think a lot about East China Sea, South China Sea, and the Taiwan
Strait as potential US-China flash points.]{.underline} [In fact, those
areas are so central to the competition]{.underline} that I [don\'t know
that we would even describe them as peripheral]{.underline}. I mean,
that [might be the **core of this competition**.]{.underline}

Hal Brands: [East Asia might be the core in another way as well in that
it\'s probably the most economically dynamic region of the
world]{.underline}, or at least it has been for a while, and so [it\'s
not like fighting in Southeast Asia during the 1960s when that was the
Third World, it was economically underdeveloped,]{.underline} and so on
and so forth. It\'s a bit of a different situation. But, nonetheless, [I
think that\'s where the potential for direct conflict between the US and
China is **most severe** because that\'s where our security commitments,
or our ambiguous security commitments in the case of Taiwan, overlap
most directly with things that China is increasingly defining as its own
vital interests]{.underline} and indicating that it is very serious
about pursuing.

Hal Brands: [The second one]{.underline} would be, I think, [kind of the
Eurasian hinterland of China]{.underline}, and so one thing that we
sometimes forget when we think about China is that it\'s a really big
country that reaches really far into Eurasia, in fact, and [Xi Jinping
doesn\'t forget this. Remember he debuted the Belt and Road Initiative
in Central Asia, and]{.underline} so there\'s certainly a realization, I
think, in Chinese policy that [China needs to be thinking about its
territorial hinterland as potentially an area to expand influence in the
context of a US-China competition,]{.underline} maybe just because [you
want better access to and sort of overland access to resources coming
from the Middle East]{.underline}, for instance, so that [they\'re not
subject to interdiction if they have to pass through the Strait of
Malacca]{.underline} or something like that, but also because the
[Chinese have been talking more and more about trying to create, sort
of, a Eurasian space that is oriented toward China
economically]{.underline} and otherwise. So that might actually be a
pretty good parallel for kind of the Cold War periphery.

Hal Brands: Then [the third area is maybe the developing world or the
developing regions writ large]{.underline}. So when we think
particularly about technological competition, it seems fairly
unlikely\... I mean, [it seemed more likely about three years ago that
China is going to get some sort of technological hammer lock on key
American allies]{.underline} in East Asia and Europe. Most of those
[countries have started throwing up firewalls against Chinese
technological influence in one way or another.]{.underline} It\'s more
plausible when you think about [developing countries in Africa, in
Central Asia, in Latin America, Southeast Asia, places where Chinese
technology will be more attractive for price reasons above all
else]{.underline} and where some of the security concerns are perhaps
less keenly felt. So [maybe that\'s a third area where you see
peripheral conflict playing out in a US-China context.]{.underline}

#### China is threatening, but the US is an early stage of competition. Sustainability indicts assume the squo, not the longer-term trends of US strength. No safe alternative to US hegemony.

https://www.csis.org/analysis/twilight-struggle-lessons-cold-war-china-strategy-today)//KH

Mike Green: My favorite quote of the people you quote in the book is the
quote you have of Kennan, who argues that\... At the very beginning of
thinking about containment, he argues [there is no real security in this
strategic competition we were starting out with vis-a-vis the Soviets,
no real security and no alternative to living dangerously.]{.underline}
That really stuck with me because [we are, it seems to me, at a
cathartic moment in American strategic thought]{.underline}, and, as you
know well, by the way, [Australia and the Japanese and a lot of other
allies, about this problem, and that just was kind of chilling. There is
no alternative to living dangerously.]{.underline} That, to me, is the
strategic point of discontinuity we\'ve hit in the last few years. We
now [realize there\'s no responsible stakeholder. There\'s no new model
of great power relations. There is no alternative to living
dangerously]{.underline}. That really stuck with me. But that\'s a
little bit of a depressing note to strike, so how would you
characterize\... What does it mean, in your words, to be preparing for a
long struggle?

Hal Brands: So it\'s a great question, and I think maybe I\'ll start by
starting in the present and then working my way backwards. You
[mentioned the transition period in US-China relations that probably
began about five years ago with the advent of the Trump presidency when
we decided that the responsible stakeholder was more or less
dead]{.underline} and we were [moving into a period of competition.
In]{.underline} a way, I think that [realization kind of felt liberating
for a lot of American policymakers]{.underline}. I mean, there was [less
concern about not rocking the boat in the US-China
relationship]{.underline}, and there was freedom to do things that the
United States might have wanted to do but felt constrained to do in
economic competition or technological competition for a while.

Hal Brands: But I think we\'ve reached the point now where it\'s
actually more sobering than anything else. I mean, competition is not
free of danger. We\'ve learned that very much over the past year, both
in the US-Russia and the US-China relationship, where I think [when a
lot of people were thinking about competition with China even a couple
of years ago, it was sort of in this abstract way]{.underline} and now
you realize that, very tangibly[, there is a danger of military conflict
that attends any geopolitical competition. It could happen in the Taiwan
Strait. It could happen in Eastern Europe. It could happen in a number
of places]{.underline}.

Hal Brands: So it\'s important going into the study of great power
competition not to have a sanitized view of what it means, and this
takes us back to the Cold War, where we look back on the Cold War now
and we think of it as the "Long Peace." The exaggerated version of this
is almost that, you know, there was a 45-year principled agreement to
compete short of war but not go into war, and that really, obviously,
wasn\'t how it worked. There were pervasive fears of global military
conflict during the Cold War. The United States had to think very
seriously about how to deter such a conflict or to fight it if it
occurred, and so competition was really kind of a terrifying experience,
especially given the presence of nuclear weapons in that competition and
how new and terrifying they were. So I think Kennan\'s quote is quite
appropriate in the sense that when we talk about competition, we\'re
actually talking about something that can be quite perilous.

Mike Green: Looking at the Cold War precedent, again[, this is not the
Cold War again, but embarking on a long struggle like this is an
experience where you got to look back at the last time you did
it]{.underline}, as you argue throughout the book[. How prepared do you
think the American people are? How much consensus is there behind this
competition compared with, say, 1948, \'49?]{.underline} The Korean War
was cathartic, but before the Korean War, before June 1950, you had the
America Firsters, you had isolationists, you had people opposing NATO.
It was not as if the entire American population read the "Long Telegram"
and got it, right? Where are we today, do you think, compared to the
beginning of that struggle?

Hal Brands: In some ways, [we\'re better placed than we were back then
for the reason that you allude to,]{.underline} which is it\'s a mistake
to think back that there was this rock solid Cold War consensus that
came about in 1946 and lasted through the end of the Cold War. That's
not how it happened. There were left-wing critiques of containment in
the late \'40s. There were right-wing critiques of containment in the
late 1940s. [There was not an acceptance, really, until the \'50s, maybe
even the \'60s, that the United States was going to maintain this
network of global military and diplomatic commitments]{.underline} that
it had kind of been left with after World War II and took up in the
course of the Cold War.

Hal Brands: So if you looked at where we are today, you know, [the
United States actually has a lot of the things that it needs to compete
with China and Russia]{.underline}, right? We have [a network of
alliances that\'s still probably our foremost tool in
competition]{.underline}. We don\'t have to build that from scratch. [We
don\'t have to build an intelligence community from scratch, a national
security state from scratch in the way that we did during the Cold
War]{.underline}. So I think we\'re better prepared in those ways. Where
we\'re maybe a little bit worse prepared comes from the fact that I
think that the consensus on competition, and let\'s focus on China here,
is probably broader than it is deep right now, and so [there is a
bipartisan consensus that China is a competitor of the United
States]{.underline}, whatever that means. [It came from the Trump
administration. It\'s come from the Biden administration]{.underline}.
It has bipartisan support in Congress, and the polling on this stuff
indicates that the American people are more or less on board with that
proposition. But when you start getting into specific issue areas, I
think the consensus looks a little bit shallower.

Hal Brands: So when you start asking people, \"Should the United States
restrict outbound investment into China to prevent Chinese companies
from using American money to pursue the goals of the People\'s
Liberation Army" and things like that, you start getting less consensus.
When it comes to aspects of technological competition, when it comes to,
you know, things that might actually pose some difficult choices for the
United States economically or politically, I think there\'s less
consensus. So I think [we\'re still at a fairly early stage of the
competition in that respect, and part of the reason is that, and I\'d
maybe put an asterisk next to this statement, there hasn\'t been
something quite like the Korean War to have the galvanizing factor in
American public opinion. COVID maybe comes close. I think COVID had a
pretty disastrous effect on China\'s global image,]{.underline} and it
certainly had a liberating effect on China hawks within the United
States, but I\'m not sure that the effect is as profound as some of the
early Cold War stuff was. So, for those reasons, I think we\'re in a
little bit better position but also maybe a little bit more tenuous
position than we were in, say, 1951.

Mike Green: And maybe the biggest difference\... And, again, you\'re not
saying this is a new Cold War. But in terms of using that experience to
understand the dynamics of geopolitical competition and what it means
for the American way of government and strategy, probably the biggest
difference, you\'d agree, I think, is you didn\'t have such a stake in
Soviet economic interests. You didn\'t have, you know, prominent Wall
Street financiers, to this day, calling for basically no decoupling and
faith in the marketplace with China. You didn\'t have soybean farmers in
most states of the union getting most of their income from exports to
China. You didn\'t have all of these stakeholders within the US system
who had so much to gain from the Chinese economy.

Mike Green: You didn\'t talk a lot about that in the book, but how would
you amend the lessons, given that piece of it? We\'ve surveyed this, you
know, at CSIS, and both thought leaders and the American public are
quite willing to decouple on high tech and do things like that. But when
it comes to stopping agricultural exports or things that benefit us or
cheap consumer goods, there\'s not a lot of support, and that\'s very
different from the Soviet Union. We had no economic relationship,
really, that affected average Americans. So what do you do with that one
when you\'re trying to look at the parallels and the lessons?

Hal Brands: Yeah. What\'s different is that [there are very powerful
interests in American society that have a very strong stake in a stable
US-China relationship and an open US-China relationship, and that\'s not
entirely a bad thing]{.underline}. I mean, I think that the [key is to
think not so much about broad or complete economic decoupling as to try
to figure out what are the areas in which we absolutely cannot be
dependent on China for critical goods or critical inputs]{.underline}?
What are the areas in which we absolutely cannot be enabling China\'s
development? Presumably, we [don\'t want to make it easier for Huawei to
wire the world with 5G telecommunications, things like that. And then
what are the larger areas of not particularly sensitive or strategic
trade where it\'s fine if there\'s a particularly extensive US-China
relationship]{.underline}? I [don\'t know that China buying a lot of
agricultural products from the United States is necessarily a point of
strategic vulnerability]{.underline} for us. I think, if anything, it
[testifies to a strategic vulnerability of China\'s, which is that they
are highly dependent on imports of food]{.underline} and other goods
from abroad.

#### Post-Ukraine, a European economic shift means the US' position as a global hegemon is secure

**Brands 22** -- *Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments* (Hal
Brands, May, 21, 2022, \"Democracies Can Out-Compete the China-Russia
Alliance,\"
https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/3657196/hal-brands/democracies-can-out-compete-china-russia-alliance)//KH

The [economic trauma of the Ukraine War is only beginning: Energy
shocks, food-supply disruption and commodity shortages will have growing
impact as the conflict persists.]{.underline} The war, moreover, is just
part of an acceleratng geo-economic realignment.

[The golden age of globalization, when countries pursued interdependence
with minimal fear of insecurity, is over. The global economy is now
being reshaped by competition and conflict. That will create some
**opportunities for the US to strengthen its position**]{.underline} ---
as well as a whole lot of worldwide turmoil.

A remarkable aspect of the [post-Cold War era was that calculations of
economic efficiency so often trumped calculations of geopolitical
risk]{.underline}. An era that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall
was dominated by the pursuit of integration across traditional strategic
divides.

A web of trade, [financial and technological ties developed between
China and the world's democracies. European countries became highly
reliant on Russian energy (notably Germany) and investment (the UK). The
pursuit of profit was accompanied by a diplomatic rationale]{.underline}
--- that economic entanglement would create a common interest in global
stability, mitigating whatever dangers might otherwise result from
trading with a prospective enemy.

That rationale proved faulty. [Globalization increased Chinese and
Russian capabilities without meaningfully decreasing their
ambitions]{.underline}. By the mid-2010s, global tensions were
increasing and interdependence came to be seen as a source of
vulnerability.

Worried that Beijing might translate technological primacy into
geopolitical primacy, President Donald Trump's administration urged
other nations to wall off their 5G telecommunications networks against
Chinese influence. It sought to forestall completion of the Nord Stream
II pipeline between Russia and Germany, lest Europe become
diplomatically paralyzed by dependence on Moscow's energy.

[When Beijing then threatened to withhold critical pharmaceutical
components amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it showed how complex supply
chains could be wielded as strategic weapons.]{.underline}

In this context, the war in [Ukraine has thrown global integration into
reverse. Western companies that pushed into Russia after the Cold War
are being forced to flee,]{.underline} with McDonald's Corp. being the
latest (and perhaps most symbolic). [US export controls have severed
Russia's access to advanced semiconductors; Germany and other European
democracies are rapidly undoing decades of economic
engagement.]{.underline} This conflict-driven decoupling [may simply be
a preview of what comes next.]{.underline}

[President Xi Jinping's China was already pursuing what Matthew
Pottinger, deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration,
calls an "offensive decoupling" strategy]{.underline} --- a program
meant to insulate the country from Western pressure and give it
tremendous coercive power by dominating critical technologies. [Xi's
"dual circulation" program is meant to develop China's internal market
and make the country less reliant on external markets]{.underline} that
might slam shut in a crisis.

It seems inevitable that this campaign will accelerate. China, whose
relations with Washington are in a nosedive, can hardly leave itself
susceptible to the sort of punishment the US and its allies have imposed
on Moscow.

Similar processes are underway across the democratic world. [Europe is
moving to wean itself off Russian oil and natural gas. The US is
considering sharper curbs on investment in China; Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen is pushing "friend-shoring," or relocating production to
countries aligned with Washington.]{.underline}

The administration of President Joe Biden is also working with allies,
such as Japan, to create technological supply chains and innovation
ecosystems that leave China on the outside.

It has refused, so far, to remove Trump's tariffs on China, a step that
would help ease inflation, for fear of surrendering a diplomatic
advantage. This turns the post-Cold War norm on its head: [Calculations
of geopolitical risk are now trumping calculations of economic
efficiency.]{.underline}

To be sure, [interdependence is hardly a thing of the past. US trade in
goods with China was more than \$650 billion last year, and American
companies such as Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. are doing more, not less,
business with Beijing.]{.underline}

But [the basic trend is toward a more balkanized global economy, in
which key rivals aim to seal off dangerous vulnerabilities and
manipulate the terms of interdependence to their advantage.]{.underline}
And if recent experience is any indication, [this process will happen
gradually until it happens rapidly --- when a grave crisis erupts, as in
Ukraine, and sunders ties that had seemed unbreakable not long
before.]{.underline}

[Structurally speaking, the US is well positioned. America and the other
advanced democracies possess a clear majority of global production and
wealth. If they, plus key developing states such as India, deepen their
integration with each other while limiting it with their rivals, they
can create a free-world economy more vibrant than anything China, let
alone Russia, can muster]{.underline}.

But [the current crisis has also revealed how delinquent the democratic
world has been in planning for the dramatic economic interruptions a
major geopolitical showdown involving China would cause.]{.underline}
And even if the US and its allies get their act together, [no one should
underestimate the dislocations headed our way.]{.underline}

As Ukraine demonstrates, [obtaining greater geo-economic security will
require rupturing supply chains, upending trade and investment patterns,
and otherwise revisiting the lucrative efficiencies of the post-Cold War
era. A world that is more divided geopolitically will be more turbulent
economically as well.]{.underline}

#### Alliance post-Trump proves East Asia and Europe will always be dependent on the US -- Ukraine marks a shift towards optimism

**Kagan and Neil 22** -- *Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution;
adjunct professor at Georgetown* (Andrew Neil interviewing Robert Kagan,
5-10-2022, \"Episode 3: Robert Kagan,\" Tortoise,
https://www.tortoisemedia.com/audio/episode-3-robert-kagan/)//KH

Andrew Neil: So, given Europe's robust response to the invasion of
Ukraine so far, are Americans still from Mars and Europeans still from
Venus, as you once memorably wrote?

Robert Kagan: I still think it's the case and, by the way, for entirely
understandable reasons that the United States is still more prone to use
force in situations than Europeans are. That derives to some extent from
European capabilities; Europe doesn't really have much in the way of
force projection capabilities and up until now, I think it has been
quite clear that Europeans haven't wanted it. The discussion has
certainly been taking place for decades, right? How many times have we
said that the Europeans, that the Europeans have said that they are
going to build up their military? They haven't; they've made their
choice. Maybe that will change to some extent but I don't see Europe
playing that kind of, becoming its own sort of stand-alone superpower,
even though I would be delighted if it did.

So, it is partly capability and capability to some extent drives
decision-making but of course, on the other hand -- and this is
something that I wish Americans were more sensitive to when it comes to
countries like Germany -- [Europe has a past that is fraught with
conflict and nationalism and two major bloody conflicts in the 20th
century and for Europe to be inclined toward peace is of great benefit
to the world and to the United States]{.underline}. I think we should,
to some extent, welcome the degree to which Europeans are more
peacefully inclined than maybe they have been in previous centuries and
I wouldn't be quick to want to push them in a different direction, quite
honestly.

I think it means, and this is where it gets complicated, is it means [to
some extent Europe is going to continue to depend for its security on
the American security umbrella. America should be willing, in fact
perfectly willing to provide that security umbrella in the interests of
global peace and there is going to be that disparity between the
two.]{.underline}

Andrew Neil: Let me move on to some wider considerations of American
foreign policy and its place in the world. [Is there not less of an
appetite for America, at home and abroad, to play its dominant role on
the world stage because of the failure of the US interventionism that
you've espoused?]{.underline}

Robert Kagan: [That's not what it seems to be the case,]{.underline}
does it? I mean, it's interesting to me how frequently since the Iraq
war, to take the obvious example, [Americans have been very slow to get
over the Iraq war and I would agree with you that it has certainly made
Americans less inclined to use force in situations where I think in
retrospect they ought to have,]{.underline} for instance Syria, to keep
Russia out and to deal with the horrific humanitarian disaster visited
upon the Syrian people by Assad, but yes, there is no question that Iraq
and to some extent Afghanistan, have had that effect.

[The effect on the rest of the world I think is much less
clear.]{.underline} [I don't notice in Japan any less of a desire to
hold on to the US security relationship. In fact, they continue to be
demandeurs in that relationship, as are other nations in East
Asia]{.underline} and what we saw [in the case of Europe was that the
United States was not only called upon to play a critical role but that
role was welcomed]{.underline} and in fact, the one reaction that I most
noted in Europe in recent years was [the horror with which Europeans
greeted the Trump administration and the whole idea of America
First]{.underline} [and Trump's discussion about perhaps getting out of
Nato and Trump's general hostility to the idea that the United States
should do anything for Europeans]{.underline}, to provide Europeans with
any security. And [what was the European reaction to that? It was horror
and hopes and prayers that we would get back to an administration like
we have now, which is willing to play that role.]{.underline}

Most people and most countries that are made up of people, they have one
question on their mind at any given moment, which is are you there for
us or not when we need you? That is the question that people ask in East
Asia, it is definitely the question that people ask in Eastern Europe
and when they ask that question, they don't talk about Iraq, they talk
about the fact that [they want the United States there to protect them
and to help them protect themselves.]{.underline}

Andrew Neil: But the American people have got a right to ask a question
too.

Robert Kagan: And they do and they have.

Andrew Neil: You want us there to help you but what are you doing to
help yourself? Look how Germany has allowed its military to be hollowed
out and is only now, in the aftermath of Ukraine, doing anything about
it.

Robert Kagan: Well, as I say, I've never quite understood why Americans
should be eager for Germany to become a big military nation again but if
that's what Americans think they want, I understand the impulse, it's
not agreeing with it. But mostly I think you're right, of course,
Americans -- and by the way, that's why I was surprised by the reaction
in this case, right. [I would have expected, based on what you're saying
and based on what American public opinion have looked like at least for
the last decade or so, that there would be less interest in a European
crisis of this nature than there has been]{.underline}. But look at
what's happened [in the United States, it's been almost a revolution of
American public opinion, which will increase by the way inevitably, but
the dissenting views have been few and far between in the United
States]{.underline} so what that indicates to me is [that there is more
in that reservoir than we may have thought in terms of American
willingness, the American public's willingness to play a more active
global role.]{.underline}

Of course, [we've seen reverses like this in the past.]{.underline} You
brought up the 1930s, clearly that was a major reversal of American
public opinion, [driven eventually by Pearl Harbour but not initially by
Pearl Harbour. I mean American's opinion began to shift after Munich,
after Kristallnacht, after the invasion of Poland]{.underline} etc, so
again you have to go back to this understanding that Americans believe
they live in a safe corner of the world, where the rest of the world
can't touch them and it is very easy for them to say 'Why did we get
involved in here and why did we get involved there?', especially when
the wars don't turn out the way we want them to but does that kill off
that sentiment for international involvement of the United States? I
would say clearly not.

Andrew Neil: I can see why America, you can argue that America still has
an appetite to protect existing democracies and it is democracies,
they're our allies -- Japan because of China, European democracies
because of Russia and so on, but it doesn't, I would suggest to you,
have an appetite now for your kind of liberal interventionism. I mean,
it's often bloody efforts to spread democracy this century, has rather
than succeeding, we've had a century of growing authoritarianism and
autocracy. So-called liberal interventionism has hardly been deemed a
success.

Robert Kagan: Well, first of all, [it's a complete myth that the United
States went into Iraq and certainly went into Afghanistan in order to
promote democracy. The reasons why the United States went into Iraq --
rightly or wrongly -- were driven by security interests and
fears]{.underline}, especially after 9/11. It was not ...

Andrew Neil: There was a whole floor of the State Department devising
plans to rebuild an Iraq based on democracy, I saw it myself. It was
called Iraq Shack.

Robert Kagan: I understand that but that was the ... [the purpose of
invading Iraq was not to spread democracy]{.underline}. Now, as you
know, [once the United States invades a country, it invariably decides
the best way to leave that country is to leave it a
democracy.]{.underline} That was the case in Germany and Japan, it was
the case in Central American countries where we were more or less --
usually less -- successful in accomplishing that goal but the question
is, if you want to say an American foreign policy, anyone's American
foreign policy, certainly my foreign policy was aimed at spreading
democracy by force: that's just a myth, okay, that's a myth that's been
created by people who want to oppose these things for one reason or
another, which is fine. There was a perfectly good reason to oppose the
war in Iraq but that's not what that was about.

Now, the fact is however, I am interested to hear you say that the world
has just become incredibly authoritarian. [Russia and China have been
authoritarian all along but it is driven by this single rule by one
individual and I do think, by the way, to some extent that is an
indication of how the order has weakened in recent decades]{.underline}
and I don't deny that the order, [the liberal order, had
weakened]{.underline}. So, countries that used to at least feel that
they needed, even dictatorships needed to put up the pretence of having
elections to legitimise their rule, I think in recent years they have
felt less and less the need to do so because the democratic idea has
been in retreat, by the way, just the way the democratic idea was in
retreat in the 1920s and 30s as well.

But I [don't think that what we have witnessed is the triumph of
authoritarianism and I would say it is even harder to say that today
where it seems to me if any country in the world, if any regime in the
world is in peril right now, it is more likely to be Moscow's than any
democratic countries]{.underline}.

Andrew Neil: Part of your case for liberal interventionism is that there
are global responsibilities which only America can bear. Would it not be
more honest to say, it's got global interests that it needs to pursue?

Robert Kagan: You would have to explain to me exactly why the United
States has more interest in stopping China's expansion or Russia's
expansion, for that matter, than any of the dozens of countries that lie
around their borders. [It seems to me that the United States has less
interest and that this is not driven, American policy is not driven
exclusively by what Americans perceive as their interests except insofar
as Americans perceive their interest as defending the democratic world
order,]{.underline} which by the way, most [Americans would not say was
their goal even though I think it ought to be their goal,]{.underline}
okay.

It is simply the case that Americans at a certain point, I would say
World War II and aftermath, decided that they didn't want to live in a
world that was dominated by authoritarians in Europe and Asia but the
anti-interventionists who argue that America would not have been
threatened if Hitler had won in Germany and Japan had won in Asia, I
don't think that we can know for sure that they were wrong about that.
So, we have to be careful about saying these are American interests
because, in many cases, what Americans have done is they have
incorporated the interests of their allies as their own, but if you just
look, if you are sitting in Iowa today, what do you care what happens in
Ukraine?

Andrew Neil: But as we move now well into the 2020s and the 20th century
becomes a bit of a memory, does America, [do Americans still have the
stomach to be a global player on a major scale in Europe and East
Asia?]{.underline}

Robert Kagan: Well, it's a good question. I don't think I can say with
any certainty that I know what the answer is. They have in the past
played simultaneously large roles in both Asia and Europe; they
certainly are capable of doing it. I think one of the things that we've
discovered in this crisis is how sort of healthy and vibrant those
relationships really are. You know, I think the most extraordinary part
of this whole thing of course was the financial response and the ability
to get [countries in Asia which are not at all threatened by what is
going on in Ukraine, to take part in these sanctions]{.underline}
because they want to make sure that when the same thing happens to them,
the Europeans will then support them and the United States will support
them. To me [that's a sign of real health on the part of the overall
structure of the system, which makes it easier for
Americans]{.underline} -- and that's why I wanted to make that point.

[It makes it easier for Americans to sustain such a role when they feel
that the allies are also heavily engaged and is it going to help in
American politics if Germany fulfils the recent commitment to increase
their defence budget? Yes, it will]{.underline}. It will be an argument
for those who want to say these alliances are important and so I do
think it is quite possible that they will sustain it but the problem is
of course, we don't know what events are going to happen, we don't know
what disasters will befall us. We don't know for instance -- and I know
this is of interest to you -- what the political situation in the United
States is going to be after 2024 for instance.

Andrew Neil: And I want to come onto that in a minute for our final part
but the reason I ask if America still has the stomach, because you will
know better than me that the demands of Europe, where the Russian bear
is still active, and Asia where you have this enormous rising power in
China, they require very different military capabilities. One is
land-based, boots on the ground, armour; the other is amphibious and
air. That's a big military build that America would have to pay to do
both.

Robert Kagan: Well, I think it ought to have been doing both all along
in any case and, you know, as it happens, [if the United States had
favoured anything in the past ten years, it has favoured preparing for a
China contingency,]{.underline} not a Russia contingency and the good
news I think on the Russia side of it is, well look, we were able to
\[33:57\] tens of thousands of troops, [the troop build-up in Eastern
Europe right now is pretty substantial and again, we may have the luxury
afforded us of having seen that the Russian military does not have the
kind of formidable capabilities that we may have thought]{.underline}.

#### NATO expansion hasn't caused conflict -- US hegemonic promotion is peaceful and sustainable

**Brands 22** -- *Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments*. (Hal, 15
March, 2022, \"Putin's Biggest Lie: Blaming NATO for His War,\"
https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/3532081/hal-brands/putin%E2%80%99s-biggest-lie-blaming-nato-his-war)//KH

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, US officials
and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the post-Cold War
peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have charged that
Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the aggressive
expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

[The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the US threw it all away]{.underline}. Rather than
conciliating a defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by
expanding a vast military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into
the former Soviet Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a
liberal-democratic guise eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. [Putin's wars are indeed meant, in
part, to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the
idea that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.]{.underline}

Far from being a historic blunder, NATO expansion was one of the great
American successes of the post-Cold War era. Far from being the act of a
domineering superpower, it was part of a long tradition of vulnerable
states begging to join America's liberal empire. And far from posing a
mortal threat to Moscow, NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with
far greater security than it could have provided itself.

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember something
that nearly everyone has now forgotten: There was no guarantee that
Europe would be mostly stable, peaceful and democratic after the Cold
War. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO expansion as a
catastrophe once warned that a post-Cold War Europe could become a
violent hellscape.

It wasn't an outlandish scenario. A reunified Germany might once again
try to dominate its neighbors; the old enmity between Moscow and Berlin
could reignite. The collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe could
liberate those states to pursue long-suppressed territorial claims and
nationalist agendas. Ethnic tensions and nuclear proliferation might
explode as the Cold War order crumbled.

[If the US pulled back once the Soviet threat was gone, there would be
no extra-European superpower to put out fires on a continent with lots
of geopolitical kindling.]{.underline} "The prospect of major crises,
even wars, in Europe is likely to increase dramatically," Mearsheimer
predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the logical answer to these fears. Expansion was a
way of binding a reunified Germany to the West and surrounding it with
democratic allies.]{.underline} Joining NATO required new members to lay
aside any revanchist designs, while allowing them to pursue economic and
political reforms rather than investing heavily in military capabilities
to defend their newly won autonomy.

NATO's move to the east also ensured that Poland and other states that
easily could have built nuclear weapons didn't need to, because they had
American protection. Most important, enlargement kept the US firmly
planted in Europe, by preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic
relationship from becoming obsolete.

No other initiative could have accomplished these objectives.
Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose security cooperation
agreements with former Soviet-bloc states --- didn't offer the ironclad
guarantees that came with NATO membership. (If you want to understand
the difference between "security partner" and "NATO ally," just look at
what is happening today to Ukraine, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power and promises could provide stability in Europe, and
NATO was the continent's critical link to the US]{.underline}. Since
1949, [Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as
France and Germany, while also protecting them from external
threats]{.underline}. After 1991, NATO expansion took this zone of
peace, prosperity and cooperation that had emerged in Western Europe and
moved it into Eastern Europe as well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "[Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier,]{.underline}" protecting the continent from
dangers within and without.

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the US exploited the
Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits such
as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a country
whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy undermined
by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all [policies have costs. The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites --- although we often forget that
Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian President
Boris Yeltsin]{.underline}, bringing Russia into elite Western
institutions such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in
the intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. Yet the cost of not expanding
NATO might have been forfeiting much of the stability that initiative
provided. [Trade-offs are inevitable in foreign policy: There was no
magic middle path that would have provided all the benefits with none of
the costs.]{.underline}

Second[, if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably benign and consensual form of empire]{.underline}.
[When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did so at the urging of
the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians.]{.underline} The Baltic countries and
others were soon banging at the door. The states of Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union were desperate to join America's sphere of
influence, because they were desperate to leave Moscow's.

This, too, was part of an older pattern: The [US has often extended its
influence by "invitation" rather than imposition. The creation of NATO
in 1949 was **mostly a European idea**:]{.underline} Countries that were
terrified of Moscow sought protection from Washington. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the US empire has trouble keeping members
out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet [this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. After the Cold War, America steadily
withdrew most of its troops and all of its heavy armor from the
continent. US allies engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Part of the answer is that [NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad.]{.underline} The Soviet Union, and the Russian
empire before it, had traditionally sought to control countries along
their frontiers and used brutal means to do it. To say that NATO
expansion caused Russian belligerence is thus [to make an extremely
dubious assertion: that absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
satisfied, status quo power.]{.underline}

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, [safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire.]{.underline} For 20 years, [Putin has been publicly lusting
after the sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once
enjoyed]{.underline}. NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by
giving Moscow's former vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO also threatened a certain type of Russian government --- an
autocracy that was never secure in its own rule.]{.underline} A
democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded being neighbors with
Western-leaning democracies, because political liberty in those
countries wouldn't have threatened to set a subversive example for
anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a US-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

To be sure, US officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia was
prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength[, US officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance]{.underline}, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving
Putin both the pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by
tearing those two countries apart.

Yet [there is a curious morality in accounts that blame the West, which
sought to protect vulnerable states in Eastern Europe, for the current
carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who has worked to dismember and
intimidate those countries.]{.underline} It is sloppy thinking to tally
up the costs of NATO expansion without considering the historic
achievements of a policy that served American, European and even certain
Russian interests remarkably well.

And if nothing else, [NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold
War]{.underline} --- a factor of great significance now that a second
cold war is underway.

The [legacy of NATO expansion isn't simply a matter of historical
interest. Americans' understanding of the past has always influenced
their view of what policies to pursue in the future]{.underline}. During
the 1920s and 1930s, the widespread, if inaccurate, belief that America
had entered World War I to serve the interests of banks and arms
manufacturers had a paralyzing effect on US policy amid the totalitarian
aggression that set off World War II.

Today, the US faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's imperial
project and protect an endangered world order. Introspection is an
admirable quality, but the last thing America needs is another bout of
self-flagellation rooted in another misapprehension of the past.

#### US hegemony is [inevitable]{.underline} and [stable]{.underline}, but renewed efforts are necessary to check transition wars and dismantle US psychological hegemonic denialism

**Kagan 21** -- *Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution; adjunct
professor at Georgetown* (Robert Kagan, March/April 2021, \"A
Superpower, Like It or Not,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/superpower-it-or-not)//KH

[All great powers have a deeply ingrained self-perception shaped by
historical experience, geography, culture, beliefs, and myths. Many
Chinese today yearn to recover the greatness of a time when they ruled
unchallenged at the pinnacle of their civilization]{.underline}, before
"the century of humiliation." [Russians are nostalgic for Soviet days,
when they were the other superpower and ruled from Poland to
Vladivostok]{.underline}. Henry Kissinger once observed that Iranian
leaders had to choose whether they wanted to be "a nation or a cause,"
but great powers and aspiring great powers often see themselves as both.
Their [self-perception shapes their definition of the national interest,
of what constitutes genuine security and the actions and resources
necessary to achieve it]{.underline}. Often, it is these
self-perceptions that drive nations, empires, and city-states forward.
And sometimes to their ruin. Much of the drama of the past century
resulted from great powers whose aspirations exceeded their capacity.

[Americans have the opposite problem. Their capacity for global power
exceeds their perception of their proper place and role in the
world]{.underline}. Even as they have met the challenges of Nazism and
Japanese imperialism, Soviet communism, and radical Islamist terrorism,
they have never regarded this global activism as normal. Even in the era
of the Internet, long-range missiles, and an interdependent global
economy, [many Americans retain the psychology of a people living apart
on a vast continent, untouched by the world's turmoil. Americans have
never been isolationists]{.underline}. In times of emergency, they can
be persuaded to support extraordinary exertions in far-off places. But
they regard these as exceptional responses to exceptional circumstances.
[They do not see themselves as the primary defender of a certain kind of
world order; they have never embraced that "indispensable"
role.]{.underline}

As a result, Americans have often played it poorly. Their continental
view of the world has produced a century of wild
oscillations---indifference followed by panic, mobilization and
intervention followed by retreat and retrenchment. [That Americans refer
to the relatively low-cost military involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq
as "forever wars" is just the latest example of their
intolerance]{.underline} for the messy and unending business of
preserving a general peace and acting to forestall threats. In both
cases[, Americans had one foot out the door the moment they entered,
which hampered their ability to gain control of difficult
situations.]{.underline}

This [on-again, off-again approach has confused and misled allies and
adversaries, often]{.underline} to the point of [**spurring conflicts**
that could have been avoided by a clear and steady application of
American power and influence in the service of a peaceful, stable, and
liberal world order.]{.underline} The twentieth century was littered
with the carcasses of foreign leaders and governments that misjudged the
United States, from Germany (twice) and Japan to the Soviet Union to
Serbia to Iraq. If the twenty-first century is not to follow the same
pattern---most dangerously, in the competition with China---[then
Americans will need to stop looking for the exits and accept the role
that fate and their own power have thrust upon them]{.underline}.
Perhaps after four years of President Donald Trump, Americans are ready
for some straight talk.

OF TWO MINDS

[Americans' preference for a limited international role is a product of
their history and experience and of the **myths** they tell
themselves]{.underline}. Other great powers aspire to recapture past
glories. Americans have always yearned to recapture what they imagine as
the innocence and limited ambition of their nation's youth. For the
first decades of the new republic's existence, Americans struggled
merely to survive as a weak republic in a world of superpower
monarchies. They spent the nineteenth century in selfishness and
self-absorption, conquering the continent and struggling over slavery.
By the early twentieth century, the United States had become the richest
and potentially most powerful country in the world, but one without
commitments or responsibilities. It rose under the canopy of a
benevolent world order it had no part in upholding. "Safe from attack,
safe even from menace," the British historian James Bryce wrote of the
United States in 1888, "she hears from afar the warring cries of
European races and faiths, as the gods of Epicurus listened to the
murmurs of the unhappy earth spread out beneath their golden dwellings."
For the moment, Bryce wrote, "she sails upon a summer sea."

But then the world shifted, and Americans suddenly found themselves at
the center of it. The old order upheld by the United Kingdom and made
possible by a tenuous peace in Europe collapsed with the arrival of new
powers. The rise of Germany destroyed the precarious equilibrium in
Europe, and the Europeans proved unable to restore it. The concurrent
rise of Japan and the United States put an end to more than a century of
British naval hegemony. A global geopolitics replaced what had been a
European-dominated order, and in this very different configuration of
power, the United States was thrust into a new position. Only it could
be both a Pacific and an Atlantic power. Only it, with weak neighbors to
the north and south and vast oceans to the east and west, could send the
bulk of its forces to fight in distant theaters for prolonged periods
while its homeland remained unthreatened. Only it could afford to
finance not only its own war efforts but also those of its allies,
mustering the industrial capacity to produce ships, planes, tanks, and
other materiel to arm itself while also serving as the arsenal for
everyone else. Only it could do all of this without bankrupting itself
but instead growing richer and more dominant with each major war. The
United States, the British statesman Arthur Balfour observed, had become
the "pivot" on which the rest of the world turned or, in President
Theodore Roosevelt's words, "the balance of power of the whole world."

The world had never known such a power---there was not the language to
describe it or a theory to explain it. It was sui generis. The emergence
of this unusual great power led to confusion and misjudgment. Nations
that had spent centuries calculating the power relationships in their
own regions were slow to appreciate the impact of this distant deus ex
machina, which, after long periods of indifference and aloofness, could
suddenly swoop in and transform the balance of power. Americans, too,
had a hard time adjusting. The wealth and relative invulnerability that
made them uniquely capable of fighting major wars and enforcing peace in
Europe, Asia, and the Middle East simultaneously also made them question
the necessity, desirability, and even morality of doing so. With the
United States fundamentally secure and self-sufficient, why did it need
to get involved in conflicts thousands of miles from its shores? And
what right did it have?

The case for a policy aimed at creating and preserving a liberal world
order was first made by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson during
World War I. With the United Kingdom and the other European powers no
longer able to preserve order, they argued, and as the war demonstrated,
it had fallen to the United States to create and defend a new liberal
world order. This was the purpose of the "World League for the Peace of
Righteousness," proposed by Roosevelt at the beginning of the war, and
of the League of Nations, which Wilson eventually championed after it:
to create a new peaceful order with American power at its center. Wilson
believed it was the only feasible alternative to a resumption of the
conflict and chaos that had devastated Europe. If Americans instead
turned back to their "narrow, selfish, provincial purposes," he warned,
the peace would collapse, Europe would again divide into "hostile
camps," the world would again descend into "utter blackness," and the
United States would again be dragged into war. The United States had an
interest in a peaceful and predominantly liberal Europe, a peaceful
Asia, and open and safe oceans on which Americans and their goods could
travel safely. But such a world could not be built except around
American power. Thus the United States had an interest in world order.

[Americans' capacity for global power exceeds their perception of their
proper place and role in the world.]{.underline}

Such arguments met powerful opposition. The Republican senator Henry
Cabot Lodge and other critics condemned Wilson's league as both
unnecessary and a betrayal of the founders' vision. For the United
States to concern itself with world order was to violate the basic
principles that made it an exceptional, peace-loving nation in a world
at war. Two decades later, as Americans debated whether to enter another
world war, another Republican senator, Robert Taft, ridiculed the idea
that the United States, which was perfectly safe from attack, should
"range over the world, like a knight-errant, protecting democracy and
ideals of good faith, and tilting, like Don Quixote, against the
windmills of Fascism." President Franklin Roosevelt argued that even if
the United States was not directly threatened by Nazi Germany or
imperial Japan, a world in which those powerful dictatorships dominated
their regions would be a "shabby and dangerous place to live in." It was
only a matter of time before the dictatorships would gather themselves
for a final assault on the remaining citadel of democracy, Roosevelt
believed, but even before that moment came, the United States might
become "a lone island" of democracy in a world of dictators, and
democracy itself might simply perish. But the opponents of American
intervention in World War II worried as much about the consequences of
winning as about the costs of intervening. They did not want their
country to subordinate itself to the interests of European empires, but
neither did they want it to replace those empires as the dominant world
power. Citing Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, they warned that in
becoming the "dictatress of the world," the United States would lose its
soul.

[The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor cut short the debate but left it
unsettled. Roosevelt fought the war with his eye on the postwar order he
hoped to create, but most Americans saw the war as an act of
self-defense,]{.underline} perfectly consistent with a continental
perspective. When it was over, they expected to come home.

[When the United States did end up dominating the world after World War
II, therefore, Americans suffered from a kind of cognitive
dissonance]{.underline}. During the Cold War, they took on unheard-of
global responsibilities, deploying troops in distant theaters by the
hundreds of thousands and fighting two wars, in Korea and in Vietnam,
that were 15 times as costly in terms of combat deaths as the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq would be. [They promoted an international
free-trade regime that sometimes enriched others more than themselves.
They intervened economically, politically, diplomatically, and
militarily in every corner of the world.]{.underline} And whether or not
they were conscious of it, [they did create a liberal world order, a
relatively peaceful international environment that in turn made possible
an explosion of global prosperity and a historically unprecedented
spread of democratic government.]{.underline}

That was the conscious aim of Roosevelt during World War II and of his
successors in the Truman administration. They believed that a world
order based on liberal political and economic principles was the only
antidote to the anarchy of the 1930s. For such an order to exist, the
United States could not "sit in the parlor with a shotgun, waiting,"
argued Dean Acheson, President Harry Truman's secretary of state. It had
to be out in the world actively shaping it, deterring some powers and
bolstering others. [It had to create "situations of strength" at
critical nodes, spreading stability, prosperity, and democracy,
especially in the world's core industrial regions of Europe and
Asia]{.underline}. The United States had to be "the locomotive at the
head of mankind," Acheson said, pulling the world along with it.

AMERICA ADRIFT

Yet even as they created this order, [few Americans ever understood
world order as the goal. For most, it was the threat of communism that
justified these extraordinary exertions]{.underline}, [that justified
the establishment of NATO and the defense of Japan, Korea, and,
ultimately, Vietnam]{.underline}. Resisting communism became synonymous
with the national interest, for communism was perceived as a threat to
the American way of life. When Americans balked at supporting Greece and
Turkey in 1947, the Republican senator Arthur Vandenberg told Truman
administration officials to "scare hell out of the American people," and
Acheson saw the expediency of making things, as he admitted in his
memoirs, "clearer than truth." [With communism as the sole enemy,
everything mattered. Every act was as an act of defense.]{.underline}

[When the Cold War ended, therefore, the disjunction between Americans'
actual role and Americans' self-perception became
untenable]{.underline}. [Without the global threat of communism,
Americans wondered what the purpose of their foreign policy should
be.]{.underline} What was the point of having a globe-girdling security
system, a hegemonic navy, far-flung alliances with dozens of nations,
and an international free-trade regime?

The rebellion began immediately. When the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait in 1990, President George H. W. Bush initially made the
case for driving him out on world-order grounds. "A world in which
brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go unchecked isn't the kind of
world we're going to want to live in," Bush said in a televised address
from the Oval Office, quoting the general who was commanding the U.S.
marines fighting Saddam's forces. But when realists and conservatives
criticized Bush's vision of a "new world order" as overly ambitious and
idealistic, the administration fell back on the kind of narrow,
continental rationale Americans could supposedly better
understand---"jobs, jobs, jobs," was how Secretary of State James Baker
explained what the Gulf War was about. When President Bill Clinton
intervened twice in the Balkans and then expanded NATO, it was in
defense of world order, both to stamp out ethnic cleansing in Europe and
to prove the United States' continuing commitment to what Bush had
called "a Europe whole and free." Clinton, too, was attacked by
realists---for engaging in "international social work."

Then came President George W. Bush. The second war with Iraq was also
aimed primarily at preserving world order---to rid the Middle East and
the Persian Gulf of a serial aggressor who fancied himself the new
Saladin. But the 9/11 attacks had caused world-order objectives to again
become confused with continental defense, even for the war's advocates.
When the intelligence on Saddam's weapons programs proved mistaken, many
Americans felt that they had been lied to about the direct threat Iraq
posed to the United States. President Barack Obama rode to power in part
on the angry disillusionment that still shapes American attitudes today.
Ironically, in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Obama observed that
American willingness to "underwrite global security" had brought
stability to the postwar world and that this was in the United States'
"enlightened self-interest." Yet it quickly became clear that Americans
were more interested in nation building at home. In the end, Obama's
realism, like Taft's, consisted of accepting "the world as it is," not
as advocates of world order might wish it to be.

In 1990, the former U.S. ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick argued
that the United States should return to being a "normal" nation with
normal interests, give up the "dubious benefits of superpower status,"
end the "unnatural focus" on foreign policy, and pursue its national
interests as "conventionally conceived." That meant protecting its
citizens, its territory, its wealth, and its access to "necessary"
goods. It did not mean preserving the balance of power in Europe or
Asia, promoting democracy, or taking responsibility for problems in the
world that did not touch Americans directly. This is the continental
perspective that still reigns today. It does not deny that the United
States has interests, but it proposes that they are merely the interests
that all nations have.

The problem is that [the United States has not been a normal nation for
over a century, nor has it had normal interests. Its unique power gives
it a unique role.]{.underline} Bangladeshis and Bolivians also have an
interest in global stability, after all, and they might suffer if
another Germany came to dominate Europe or if another Japan came to
dominate Asia. But no one would suggest that it was in their national
interest to prevent that from happening, because they lack the capacity
to do so, just as the United States lacked the capacity in 1798, when it
was most threatened by the prospect of a European hegemon. World order
became the United States' concern when the old world order collapsed in
the early twentieth century and the country became the only power
capable of establishing a new one in which its interests could be
protected.

That is still the case today, and yet, even more than in Kirkpatrick's
time, [continentalism remains the dominant perspective. **It informs the
language Americans use** to talk about foreign policy and **the
theoretical paradigms by which they understand** such concepts as
national interest and **security**.]{.underline} It also remains
suffused with moralism. Calls for "restraint" still recite the founders'
wisdom and declaim its betrayal as acts of hubris, messianism, and
imperialism. Many internationalists still believe that what they regard
as the unwarranted exercise of American power is the greatest obstacle
to a better and more just world. The mixed results of the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq are not merely errors of judgment and execution but
black marks on the American soul.

Americans still yearn to escape to a more innocent and simpler past. To
a degree they probably don't recognize, they yearn to have less power.
Re[alists have long understood that as long as the United States is so
powerful, it will be hard to avoid what the political scientists Robert
Tucker and David Hendrickson once called "the imperial
temptation.]{.underline}" That is one reason why realists have always
insisted that American power is in decline or simply not up to the task.
The columnist Walter Lippmann and the diplomat George Kennan made that
argument in the late 1940s, as did Kissinger in the late 1960s and the
historian Paul Kennedy in the 1980s, and many realists still make it
today. [Realists treat every unsuccessful war, from Vietnam to Iraq, as
if it were the equivalent of the Sicilian expedition, the final act of
folly that led to Athens's defeat in the war against Sparta in the fifth
century BC.]{.underline} [An entire generation of Americans has grown up
believing that the lack of clear-cut victories in Afghanistan and Iraq
proves that their country can no longer accomplish anything with power.
The rise of China, the United States' declining share of the global
economy, the advance of new military technologies, and a general
diffusion of power around the world---all have signaled the twilight,
once again, of the American order.]{.underline}

Americans still yearn to escape to a more innocent and simpler past.

Yet [if the United States were as weak as so many people claim, it
wouldn't have to practice restraint.]{.underline} It is precisely
because [the country is still capable of pursuing a world-order strategy
that critics need to explain why it should not]{.underline}. The fact is
that [the basic configuration of international power has not changed as
much as many imagine.]{.underline} The earth is still round; the United
States still sits on its vast, isolated continent, surrounded by oceans
and weaker powers; the other great powers still live in regions crowded
with other great powers; and [when one power in those regions grows too
strong for the others to balance against, the would-be victims still
look to the distant United States for help.]{.underline}

Al[though Russia possesses a huge nuclear arsenal, it is even more an
"Upper Volta with rockets"]{.underline} today than when that wisecrack
was coined, in the early Cold War. The Soviets at least controlled half
of Europe. [China has taken the place of Japan, stronger in terms of
wealth and population but with **unproven military capabilities** and a
much **less favorable strategic position.**]{.underline} When imperial
Japan expanded in the 1930s, it faced no formidable regional
competitors, and the Western powers were preoccupied with the German
threat. Today, A[sia is crowded with other great powers, including three
whose militaries are among the top ten in the world---India, Japan, and
South Korea---all of which are either allies or partners of the United
States.]{.underline} [Should Beijing,]{.underline} believing in
Washington's weakness, [use its own growing power to try to alter the
East Asian strategic situation, it might have to cope not only with the
United States but also with a global coalition of advanced industrial
nations]{.underline}, much as the Soviets discovered.

[The Trump years were a stress test for the American world order, and
**the order,**]{.underline} remarkably[, **passed**]{.underline}.
Confronted by the nightmare of a rogue superpower tearing up trade and
other agreements, U.[S. allies appeased and cajoled, bringing offerings
to the angry volcano and waiting hopefully for better times. Adversaries
also trod carefully]{.underline}. [When Trump ordered the killing of the
Iranian commander]{.underline} Qasem Soleimani, [it was reasonable to
expect Iran to retaliate,]{.underline} and it may still, but not with
Trump as president. The [Chinese suffered through a long tariff war that
hurt them more than it hurt the United States, but they tried to avoid a
complete breakdown of the economic relationship on which they
depend]{.underline}. Obama worried that providing offensive weapons to
Ukraine could lead to war with Russia, but [when the Trump
administration went ahead with the weapons deliveries, Moscow acquiesced
with barely a murmur]{.underline}. Many of [Trump's policies were
erratic and ill conceived, but they did show how much excess, unused
power the United States has]{.underline}, if a president chooses to
deploy it. In the Obama years, officials measured 50 times before
deciding not to cut, ever fearful that other powers would escalate a
confrontation. In the Trump years, it was other countries that worried
about where a confrontation with the United States might lead.

GREAT POWER, GREAT RESPONSIBILITY

T[he United States is "lazily playing with a fraction of her
immeasurable strength"]{.underline}---so the British historian Arnold
Toynbee commented somewhat ruefully in the early 1930s. At the time,
[U.S. defense spending was between two and three percent of GDP. Today,
it is a little over three percent]{.underline}. In the 1950s, during the
Eisenhower administration---often seen as a time of admirable restraint
in U.S. foreign policy---[the United States had almost one million
troops deployed overseas, out of a total American population of 170
million]{.underline}. Today, [in an era when the United States is said
to be dangerously overextended, there are roughly 200,000 U.S. troops
deployed overseas, out of a population of 330 million.]{.underline}
Setting aside whether this constitutes "lazily playing with a fraction"
of American strength, it is important to recognize that the [United
States is now in peace mode. Were Americans to shift to a war
footing]{.underline}, or even a Cold War--type footing, [in response to
some Chinese action---for instance, an attack on Taiwan---the United
States would look like a **very different animal.**]{.underline}

At the height of the late Cold War, under President Ronald Reagan, the
United States spent six percent of GDP on defense, and its arms industry
produced weapons in such quantity and of such quality that the Soviets
simply could not keep up. The Chinese could find themselves in a similar
predicament. They might "run wild for the first six months or a year,"
as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the commander of the Japanese fleet during
World War II, predicted about his own forces. But in the long run, as he
also warned, against a provoked America and its allies, they might well
meet the same fate as other U.S. rivals.

[The question is not whether the United States is still capable of
prevailing in a global confrontation,]{.underline} either hot or cold,
[with China or any other **revisionist** power**. It is.**]{.underline}
The real [question is whether the worst kinds of hostilities can be
avoided,]{.underline} whether China and other powers can be encouraged
to pursue their aims peacefully, [to confine the global competition to
the economic and political realms]{.underline} and thus spare themselves
and the world from the horrors of the next great war or even the still
frightening confrontations of another cold war.

[The United States cannot avoid such crises by continuing to adhere to a
nineteenth-century view of its national interest]{.underline}. Doing
[that would produce]{.underline} what it produced in the past: [periods
of indifference and retrenchment followed by panic, fear, and sudden
mobilization]{.underline}. Already, Americans are torn between these two
impulses. On the one hand, [China now occupies that place in the
American mind that Germany and the Soviet Union once held: an
ideological opponent that has the ability to strike at American society
directly]{.underline} and that has power and ambitions that threaten the
United States' position in a key region and perhaps everywhere else,
too. On the other hand, many [Americans believe that the United States
is in decline and that China will inevitably come to dominate
Asia.]{.underline} Indeed, the self-perceptions of the Americans and the
Chinese are perfectly symmetrical. The Chinese think that the United
States' role in their region for the past 75 years has been unnatural
and is therefore transient, and so do the Americans. The Chinese believe
that the United States is in decline, and so do many Americans. The
danger is that as Beijing ramps up efforts to fulfill what it has taken
to calling "the Chinese dream," Americans will start to panic. [It is in
times like this that miscalculations are made.]{.underline}

Perhaps the Chinese, careful students of history that they are, will not
make the mistake that others have made in misjudging the United States.
Whether Americans have learned the lessons of their own history,
however, remains to be seen. A century-long pattern of oscillation will
be difficult to change. It will be especially so when foreign policy
experts of all stripes regard support for a liberal world order as
impossible and immoral. Among other problems, their prescriptions suffer
from an unwarranted optimism about the likely alternatives to a U.S.-led
order. [Realists, liberal internationalists, conservative nationalists,
and progressives all seem to imagine that without Washington playing the
role it has played these past 75 years, the world will be just fine, and
U.S. interests will be just as well protected]{.underline}. But [neither
recent history nor present circumstances justify such idealism. The
alternative to the American world order is not a Swedish world
order.]{.underline} It will not be a world of law and international
institutions or the triumph of Enlightenment ideals or the end of
history[. It will be a world of **power vacuums, chaos, conflict, and
miscalculation**---a shabby place indeed.]{.underline}

The messy truth is that [in the real world, the only hope for preserving
liberalism at home and abroad is the maintenance of a world order
conducive to liberalism]{.underline}, and **[the only power capable of
upholding such an order is the United States]{.underline}**. This is not
an expression of hubris but a reality rooted in international
circumstances. And it is certainly a mixed blessing. In trying to
preserve this order, the United States has wielded and will wield power,
sometimes unwisely and ineffectively, with unpredictable costs and
morally ambiguous consequences. That is what wielding power means.
Americans have naturally sought to escape this burden. They have sought
to divest themselves of responsibility, hiding sometimes behind dreamy
internationalism, sometimes behind a determined resignation to accept
the world "as it is," and always with the view that absent a clear and
present danger, they can hang back in their imaginary fortress.

The time has come to tell Americans that there is no escape from global
responsibility, that they have to think beyond the protection of the
homeland. [They need to understand that the purpose of NATO and other
alliances is to defend not against direct threats to U.S. interests but
against a breakdown of the order that best serves those
interests.]{.underline} They need [to be told honestly that the task of
maintaining a world order is unending and fraught with costs but
preferable to the alternative. A]{.underline} [failure to be square with
the American people has led the country to its current predicament, with
a confused and angry public convinced that its leaders are betraying
American interests for their own nefarious, "globalist"
purposes.]{.underline} The antidote to this is not scaring the hell out
of them about China and other threats but trying to explain, again, why
the world order they created still matters. [This is a job for Joe Biden
and his new administration.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine proves US hegemony is inevitable and drawback causes conflict -- only increased intervention solves

**Kagan 22** -- *Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution; adjunct
professor at Georgetown* (Robert, May/June 2022, \"The Price of
Hegemony,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/russia-ukraine-war-price-hegemony)//KH

For years, [analysts have debated whether the United States incited
Russian President Vladimir Putin's interventions in Ukraine and other
neighboring countries or whether Moscow's actions were simply unprovoked
aggressions.]{.underline} That conversation has been temporarily muted
by the horrors of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A wave of
popular outrage has drowned out those who have long argued that the
United States has no vital interests at stake in Ukraine, that it is in
Russia's sphere of interest, and that U.S. policies created the feelings
of insecurity that have driven Putin to extreme measures. Just as the
attack on Pearl Harbor silenced the anti-interventionists and shut down
the debate over whether the United States should have entered World War
II, [Putin's invasion has suspended the 2022 version of Americans'
endless argument over their purpose in the world.]{.underline}

That is unfortunate. Although it is obscene to blame the United States
for Putin's inhumane attack on Ukraine, to insist that the invasion was
entirely unprovoked is misleading. Just as Pearl Harbor was the
consequence of U.S. efforts to blunt Japanese expansion on the Asian
mainland, and just as the 9/11 attacks were partly a response to the
United States' dominant presence in the Middle East after the first Gulf
War, so Russian decisions have been a response to the expanding
post--Cold War hegemony of the United States and its allies in Europe.
Putin alone is to blame for his actions, but the invasion of Ukraine is
taking place in a historical and geopolitical context in which the
United States has played and still plays the principal role, and
Americans must grapple with this fact.

For critics of American power, the best way for the United States to
cope is for it to retrench its position in the world, divest itself of
overseas obligations that others ought to handle, and serve, at most, as
a distant offshore balancer. These [critics would grant China and Russia
their own regional spheres of interest in East Asia and Europe and focus
the United States' attention on defending its borders and improving the
well-being of Americans]{.underline}. But [there is a core of unrealism
to this "realist" prescription: it doesn't reflect the true nature of
global power and influence that has characterized most of the post--Cold
War era and that still governs the world today.]{.underline} The [United
States was already the only true global superpower during the Cold
War,]{.underline} with its unparalleled wealth and might and its
extensive international alliances. The collapse of the Soviet Union only
enhanced U.S. global hegemony---and not because Washington eagerly
stepped in to fill the vacuum left by Moscow's weakness. Instead, [the
collapse expanded U.S. influence because the United States' combination
of power and democratic beliefs made the country attractive to those
seeking security, prosperity, freedom, and autonomy. The United States
is therefore an imposing obstacle]{.underline} to a Russia seeking to
regain its lost influence.

What has happened in eastern Europe over the past three decades is a
testament to this reality. [Washington did not actively aspire to be the
region's dominant power. But in the years after the Cold War, eastern
Europe's newly liberated countries, including Ukraine, turned to the
United States and its European allies because they believed that joining
the transatlantic community was the key to independence]{.underline},
democracy, and affluence. Eastern Europeans were looking to escape
decades---or, in some cases, centuries---of Russian and Soviet
imperialism, and allying with Washington at a moment of Russian weakness
afforded them a precious chance to succeed. Even if the United States
had rejected their pleas to join NATO and other Western institutions, as
critics insist it should have, the former Soviet satellites would have
continued to resist Moscow's attempts to corral them back into its
sphere of interest, seeking whatever help from the West they could get.
And Putin would still have regarded the United States as the main cause
of this anti-Russian behavior, simply because the country was strong
enough to attract eastern Europeans.

To insist that Putin's invasion was entirely unprovoked is misleading.

Throughout their history, Americans have tended to be unconscious of the
daily impact that U.S. power has on the rest of the world, friends and
foes alike. They are generally surprised to find themselves the target
of resentment and of the kinds of challenges posed by Putin's Russia and
by President Xi Jinping's China. Americans could reduce the severity of
these challenges by wielding U.S. influence more consistently and
effectively. They failed to do this in the 1920s and 1930s, allowing
aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan to go unchecked until it
resulted in a massively destructive world war. They failed to do so in
recent years, allowing Putin to seize more and more land until he
invaded all of Ukraine. After Putin's latest move, Americans may learn
the right lesson. But they will still struggle to understand how
Washington should act in the world if they don't examine what happened
with Russia, and that requires continuing the debate over the impact of
U.S. power.

BY POPULAR DEMAND

[So in what way might the United States have provoked Putin? One thing
needs to be clear: it was not by threatening the security of Russia.
Since the end of the Cold War, the Russians have objectively enjoyed
greater security than at any time in recent memory]{.underline}. Russia
was invaded three times over the past two centuries, once by France and
twice by Germany. During the Cold War, Soviet forces were perpetually
ready to battle U.S. and NATO forces in Europe. Yet since the end of the
Cold War, Russia has enjoyed unprecedented security on its western
flanks, even as NATO has taken in new members to its east. Moscow even
welcomed what was in many ways the most significant addition to the
alliance: a reunified Germany. When Germany was reunifying at the end of
the Cold War, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev favored anchoring it
in NATO. As he told U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, he believed
that the best guarantee of Soviet and Russian security was a Germany
"contained within European structures."

Late Soviet and early Russian leaders certainly did not act as if they
feared an attack from the West. Soviet and Russian defense spending
declined sharply in the late 1980s and through the late 1990s, including
by 90 percent between 1992 and 1996. The once formidable Red Army was
cut nearly in half, leaving it weaker in relative terms than it had been
for almost 400 years. Gorbachev even ordered the withdrawal of Soviet
forces from Poland and other Warsaw Pact states, chiefly as a
cost-saving measure. It was all part of a larger strategy to ease Cold
War tensions so that Moscow might concentrate on economic reform at
home. But even Gorbachev would not have sought this holiday from
geopolitics had he believed that the United States and the West would
take advantage of it.

His judgment was sensible. The United States and its allies had no
interest in the independence of the Soviet republics, as U.S. President
George H. W. Bush made clear in his 1991 speech in Kyiv, in which he
denounced the "suicidal nationalism" of independence-minded Ukrainians
(who would declare independence three weeks later). Indeed, for several
years after 1989, U.S. policies aimed first to rescue Gorbachev, then to
rescue the Soviet Union, and then to rescue Russian President Boris
Yeltsin. During the period of transition from Gorbachev's Soviet Union
to Yeltsin's Russia---the time of greatest Russian weakness---the Bush
administration and then the Clinton administration were reluctant to
expand NATO, despite the increasingly urgent appeals of the former
Warsaw Pact states. [The Clinton administration created the Partnership
for Peace, whose vague assurances of solidarity fell well short of a
security guarantee for former Warsaw Pact members]{.underline}.

[It is easy to see why Washington felt no great compulsion to drive NATO
eastward. Few Americans at that time saw the organization as a bulwark
against Russian expansion,]{.underline} much less as a means of bringing
Russia down. From the U.S. perspective, Russia was already a shell of
its former self. The question was whether NATO had any mission at all
now that the great adversary against which it was aimed had
collapsed---and given just how hopeful the 1990s felt to most Americans
and western Europeans. It was thought to be a time of convergence, when
both China and Russia were moving ineluctably toward liberalism.
Geoeconomics had replaced geopolitics, the nation-state was passing
away, the world was "flat," the twenty-first century would be run by the
European Union, and Enlightenment ideals were spreading across the
planet. For NATO, "out of area or out of business" was the mantra of the
day.

But as the West enjoyed its fantasies and Russia struggled to adapt to a
new world, [the nervous populations lying to the east of Germany---the
Balts, the Poles, the Romanians, and the Ukrainians---viewed the end of
the Cold War as merely the latest phase in their centuries-old
struggle.]{.underline} For them, [NATO was not obsolete. They saw what
the United States and western Europe took for granted---the Article 5
collective security guarantee---as the key to escaping a long, bloody,
and oppressive past.]{.underline} Much like the French after World War
I, who feared the day when a revived Germany would again threaten them,
[eastern Europeans believed that Russia would eventually resume its
centuries-long habit of imperialism and seek to reclaim its traditional
influence over their neighborhood]{.underline}. These states wanted to
integrate into the free-market capitalism of their richer, Western
neighbors, and membership in NATO and the European Union was to them the
only path out of a dismal past and into a safer, more democratic, and
more prosperous future. It was hardly surprising, then, that when
Gorbachev and then Yeltsin loosened the reins in the early 1990s,
practically every current, and soon former[, Warsaw Pact member and
Soviet republic seized the chance to break from the past and shift their
allegiance from Moscow to the transatlantic West.]{.underline}

But [although this massive change had little to do with U.S. policies,
it had much to do with the reality of the United States' post--Cold War
hegemony]{.underline}. [Many Americans tend to equate hegemony with
imperialism, but the two are different. Imperialism is an active effort
by one state to force others into its sphere,]{.underline} whereas
[hegemony is more a condition than a purpose. A militarily,
economically, and culturally powerful country exerts influence on other
states by its mere presence,]{.underline} the way a larger body in space
affects the behavior of smaller bodies through its gravitational pull.
Ev[en if the United States was not aggressively expanding its influence
in Europe, and certainly not through its military, the collapse of
Soviet power enhanced the attractive pull of the United States and its
democratic allies]{.underline}. Their prosperity, their freedom, and,
yes, their power to protect former Soviet satellites, when combined with
the inability of Moscow to provide any of these, dramatically shifted
the balance in Europe in favor of Western liberalism to the detriment of
Russian autocracy. [The growth of U.S. influence and the spread of
liberalism were less a policy objective of the United States than the
natural consequence of that shift.]{.underline}

[Russian leaders could have accommodated themselves to this new
reality.]{.underline} Other great powers had adjusted to similar
changes. The British had once been lords of the seas, the possessors of
a vast global empire, and the center of the financial world. Then they
lost it all. But although some were humiliated at being supplanted by
the United States, Britons rather quickly adjusted to their new place in
the firmament. The French, too, lost a great empire, and Germany and
Japan, defeated in war, lost everything except their talent for
producing wealth. But they all made the adjustment and were arguably
better for it.

[There were certainly Russians in the 1990s---Yeltsin's foreign
minister, Andrei Kozyrev, for one---who thought that Russia should make
a similar decision. They wished to integrate Russia into the liberal
West even at the expense of traditional geopolitical
ambitions]{.underline}. But that was not the view that ultimately
prevailed in Russia. Unlike the United Kingdom, France, and to some
extent Japan, Russia did not have a long history of friendly relations
and strategic cooperation with the United States---quite the contrary.
Unlike Germany and Japan, Russia was not militarily defeated, occupied,
and reformed in the process. And unlike Germany, which always knew that
its economic power was irrepressible and that in the post--World War II
order it could at least grow prosperous, Russia never really believed it
could become a successful economic powerhouse. Its elites thought that
the likeliest consequence of integration would be Russia's demotion to,
at best, a second-rank power. Russia would be at peace, and it would
still have a chance to prosper. But it would not determine the fate of
Europe and the world.

WAR OR PEACE

In the fall of 1940, Japan's foreign minister, Yosuke Matsuoka, posed
his country's predicament starkly in a meeting with other senior
officials. Japan could seek a return to cooperative relations with the
United States and the United Kingdom, he noted, but only on those
countries' terms. This meant returning to "little Japan," as the
minister of war (and future prime minister), General Hideki Tojo, put
it. To Japanese leaders at the time, that seemed intolerable, so much so
that they risked a war that most of them believed they were likely to
lose. The coming years would prove not only that going to war was a
mistake but also that the Japanese would indeed have served their
interests better by simply integrating themselves into the liberal order
from the beginning, as they did quite successfully after the war.

Putin's Russia has made much the same choice as did imperial Japan,
Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany, and many other dissatisfied powers
throughout history, and likely with the same end---eventual defeat. But
Putin's choice should hardly have come as a surprise. Washington's
protestations of goodwill, the billions of dollars it poured into the
Russian economy, the care it took in the early post--Cold War years to
avoid dancing on the Soviet Union's grave---all this had no effect,
because [what Putin wanted could not be granted by the United States. He
sought to reverse a defeat that could not be reversed without violent
force, but he lacked the wherewithal to wage a successful war. He wanted
to restore a Russian sphere of interest in central and eastern Europe
that Moscow had lost the power to sustain.]{.underline}

[The problem for Putin---and for those in the West who want to cede to
both China and Russia their traditional spheres of interest---is that
such spheres are not granted to one great power by other great
powers]{.underline}; they are not inherited, nor are they created by
geography or history or "tradition[." They are acquired by economic,
political, and military power.]{.underline} [They come and go as the
distribution of power in the international system
fluctuates.]{.underline} The United Kingdom's sphere of interest once
covered much of the globe, and France once enjoyed spheres of interest
in Southeast Asia and much of Africa and the Middle East. Both lost
them, partly due to an unfavorable shift of power at the beginning of
the twentieth century, partly because their imperial subjects rebelled,
and partly because they willingly traded in their spheres of interest
for a stable and prosperous U.S.-dominated peace. Germany's sphere of
interest once extended far to the east. Before World War I, some Germans
envisioned a vast economic Mitteleuropa, where the people of central and
eastern Europe would provide the labor, resources, and markets for
German industry. But this German sphere of interest overlapped with
Russia's sphere of interest in southeastern Europe, where Slavic
populations looked to Moscow for protection against Teutonic expansion.
[These **contested spheres helped produce both world wars**, just as the
contested spheres in East Asia had helped bring Japan and Russia to
blows in 1904.]{.underline}

[Russians may believe they have a natural, geographic, and historical
claim to a sphere of interest in eastern Europe because they had it
throughout much of the past four centuries. And many Chinese feel the
same way about East Asia, which they once dominated]{.underline}. But
even the [Americans learned that claiming a sphere of interest is
different from having one]{.underline}. For the first century of the
United States' existence, the Monroe Doctrine was a mere assertion---as
hollow as it was brazen. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth
century, when the country was able to enforce its claim, that the other
great powers were grudgingly forced to accept it. After the [Cold War,
Putin and other Russians may have wanted the West to grant Moscow a
sphere of interest in Europe, but such a sphere simply did not reflect
the true balance of power after the Soviet Union fell]{.underline}.
[China may claim the "nine-dash line"---enclosing most of the South
China Sea---as marking its sphere of interest, but until Beijing can
enforce it, other powers are unlikely to acquiesce]{.underline}.

Some Western analysts nonetheless argued when the Cold War ended, and
continue to argue now, that Washington and western Europe should have
given in to Russia's demand. But if Moscow could not enforce a sphere,
then on what grounds should the West have acceded? Fairness? Justice?
Spheres of interest are not about justice, and even if they were,
consigning the Poles and other eastern Europeans to subservience to
Moscow would have been a dubious justice. They knew what it was like to
be under Moscow's sway---the loss of independence, the imposition of
rulers willing to take direction from the Kremlin, the squelching of
individual liberties. The only way they would have accepted a return to
Russia's sphere was if they were compelled to by a combination of
Russian pressure and the studied indifference of the West.

In fact, [even if the United States had vetoed the accession of Poland
and others to NATO, as some suggested at the time that it should have,
the Balts, the Czechs, the Hungarians, and the Poles would have done
everything they could to integrate themselves into the transatlantic
community in every other possible way. They]{.underline} would have
[worked to join the global economy, to enter other Western-dominated
international institutions, and to gain whatever commitment they could
to their security---]{.underline}acts that almost certainly would have
still antagonized Moscow. Once Putin began taking slices out of Ukraine
(there would be no way for him to restore Russia to its previous
great-power status without controlling Ukraine), the [Poles and others
would have come banging on NATO's door. It seems unlikely that the
United States and its allies would have continued to say
no.]{.underline}

Russia's problem was ultimately not just about its military weakness.
Its problem was, and remains, its weakness in all relevant forms of
power, including the power of attraction. At least during the Cold War,
a communist Soviet Union could claim to offer the path to paradise on
earth. Yet afterward, Moscow could provide neither ideology, nor
security, nor prosperity, nor independence to its neighbors. It could
offer only Russian nationalism and ambition, and eastern Europeans
understandably had no interest in sacrificing themselves on that altar.
If there was any other choice, Russia's neighbors were bound to take it.
And there was: the United States and its strong alliance, merely by
existing, merely by being rich and powerful and democratic, offered a
very good choice indeed.

Putin may want to see the United States as being behind all his
troubles, and he is right that the country's attractive power closed the
door to some of his ambitions. But [the real sources of his problems are
the limitations of Russia itself and the choices that he has made not to
accept the consequences of a power struggle that Moscow legitimately
lost.]{.underline} Post--Cold War Russia, like Weimar Germany, never
suffered an actual military defeat and occupation, an experience that
might have produced a transformation of the sort that occurred in
post--World War II Germany and Japan. Like the Weimar Republic, Russia
was therefore susceptible to its own "stab-in-the-back myth" about how
Russian leaders supposedly betrayed the country to the West. But
although Russians can cast blame in any number of directions---at
Gorbachev, at Yeltsin, and at Washington---the fact is that Russia
enjoyed neither the wealth and power nor the geographic advantages of
the United States, and it was therefore never suited to be a global
superpower. [Moscow's efforts to sustain that position ultimately
bankrupted its system financially and ideologically---as may well be
happening again.]{.underline}

SOONER OR LATER

Observers used to say that Putin played a bad hand skillfully. It is
true that he read the United States and its allies correctly for many
years, pushing forward just enough to achieve limited goals without
sparking a dangerous reaction from the West, up until this latest
invasion. But even so, he had help from the United States and its
allies, which played a strong hand poorly. [Washington and Europe stood
by as Putin increased Russian military capabilities, and they did little
as he probed and tested Western resolve, first in Georgia in 2008 and
then in Ukraine in 2014. They didn't act when Putin consolidated
Russia's position in Belarus or when he established a robust Russian
presence in Syria,]{.underline} from which his weapons could reach the
southeastern flank of NATO. [And if his "special military operation" in
Ukraine had gone as planned, with the country subdued in a matter of
days, it would have been a triumphant coup,]{.underline} the end of the
first stage of Russia's comeback and the beginning of the second. Rather
than excoriating him for his inhumane folly, the world would again be
talking about Putin's "savvy" and his "genius."

Thankfully, that was not to be. But now that Putin has made his
mistakes, the [question is whether the United States will continue to
make its own mistakes or whether Americans will learn, once again, that
it is better to contain aggressive autocracies early, before they have
built up a head of steam and the price of stopping them
rises.]{.underline} The challenge posed by Russia is neither unusual nor
irrational. [The rise and fall of nations is the warp and woof of
international relations. National trajectories are changed by wars and
the resulting establishment of new power structures, by shifts in the
global economy that enrich some and impoverish others, and by beliefs
and ideologies that lead people to prefer one power over another. If
there is any blame to be cast]{.underline} on the United States for what
is happening in Ukraine, it is not that Washington deliberately extended
its influence in eastern Europe. It [is that Washington failed to see
that its influence had already increased and to anticipate that actors
dissatisfied with the liberal order would look to overturn
it.]{.underline}

For the 70-plus years since World War II, [the United States has
actively worked to keep **revisionists** at bay. But many Americans
hoped that with the end of the Cold War, this task would be finished and
that their country could become a "normal" nation with normal---which
was to say, limited---global interests]{.underline}. But [the global
hegemon **cannot tiptoe off the stage,** as much as it might wish to. It
especially cannot retreat when there are still major powers
that]{.underline}, because of their history and sense of self, cannot
give up old geopolitical ambitions---unless Americans are prepared to
live in a world shaped and defined by those ambitions, as it was in the
1930s.

[Americans are part of a never-ending power struggle, whether they wish
to be or not.]{.underline}

[The United States would be better served if it recognized both its
position in the world and its true interest in preserving the liberal
world order.]{.underline} [In the case of Russia, this would have meant
doing everything possible to integrate it into the liberal order
politically and economically while deterring it from attempting to
re-create its regional dominance by military mean]{.underline}s. The
[commitment to defend NATO allies was never meant to preclude helping
others under attack in Europe, as the United States and its allies did
in the case of the Balkans in the 1990s]{.underline}, and the United
States and its allies could have resisted military efforts to control or
seize land from Georgia and Ukraine. Imagine if the United States and
the democratic world had responded in 2008 or 2014 as they have
responded to Russia's latest use of force, when Putin's military was
even weaker than it has proved to be now, even as they kept extending an
outstretched hand in case Moscow wanted to grasp it. The [United States
ought to be following the same policy toward China: make clear that it
is prepared to live with a China that seeks to fulfill its ambitions
economically, politically, and culturally but that it will respond
effectively to any Chinese military action against its
neighbors.]{.underline}

It is true that acting firmly in 2008 or 2014 would have meant risking
conflict. But W[ashington is risking conflict now; Russia's ambitions
have created an inherently dangerous situation. It is better for the
United States to risk confrontation with belligerent powers when they
are in the early stages of ambition and expansion, not after they have
already consolidated substantial gains]{.underline}. Russia may possess
a fearful nuclear arsenal, but the [risk of Moscow using it is not
higher now than it would have been in 2008 or 2014, if the West had
intervened then]{.underline}. And [it has always been extraordinarily
small: Putin was never going to obtain his objectives by destroying
himself and his country, along with much of the rest of the world. If
the United States and its allies---with their combined economic,
political, and military power---had collectively resisted Russian
expansionism from the beginning, Putin would have found himself
constantly unable to invade neighboring countries.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, it is very difficult for democracies to take action to
prevent a future crisis. [The risks of acting now are always clear and
often exaggerated, whereas distant threats are just that: distant and so
hard to calculate]{.underline}. It always seems better to hope for the
best rather than try to forestall the worst. This common conundrum
becomes even more debilitating when Americans and their leaders remain
blissfully unconscious of the fact that they are part of a never-ending
power struggle, whether they wish to be or not.

But Americans should not lament the role they play in the world. The
reason the United States has often found itself entangled in Europe,
after all, is because what it offers is genuinely attractive to much of
the world---and certainly better when compared with any realistic
alternative. If Americans learn anything from Russia's brutalization of
Ukraine, it should be that **[there really are worse things than U.S.
hegemony.]{.underline}**

Mike Green: And maybe the biggest difference\... And, again, you\'re not
saying this is a new Cold War. But in terms of using that experience to
understand the dynamics of geopolitical competition and what it means
for the American way of government and strategy, probably the biggest
difference, you\'d agree, I think, is you didn\'t have such a stake in
Soviet economic interests. You didn\'t have, you know, prominent Wall
Street financiers, to this day, calling for basically no decoupling and
faith in the marketplace with China. You didn\'t have [soybean farmers
in most states of the union getting most of their income from exports to
China]{.underline}. You didn\'t have all of these [stakeholders within
the US system who had so much to gain from the Chinese
economy.]{.underline}

Mike Green: You didn\'t talk a lot about that in the book, but how would
you amend the lessons, given that piece of it? We\'ve surveyed this, you
know, at CSIS, and both thought leaders and the [American public are
quite willing to decouple on high tech]{.underline} and do things like
that. [But when it comes to stopping agricultural exports or things that
benefit us or cheap consumer goods, there\'s not a lot of
support,]{.underline} and that\'s very different from the Soviet Union.
We had no economic relationship, really, that affected average
Americans. [So what do you do with that one]{.underline} when you\'re
trying to look at the parallels and the lessons?

Hal Brands: Yeah. [What\'s different is that there are very powerful
interests in American society that have a very strong stake in a stable
US-China relationship]{.underline} and an open US-China relationship,
and that\'s not entirely a bad thing. I mean, I think that [the key is
to think not so much about broad or complete economic decoupling as to
try to figure out what are the areas in which we absolutely cannot be
dependent on China]{.underline} for critical goods or critical inputs?
What are the areas in which we absolutely cannot be enabling China\'s
development? Presumably, we [don\'t want to make it easier for Huawei to
wire the world with 5G telecommunications]{.underline}, things like
that. And then what are [the larger areas of not particularly sensitive
or strategic trade where it\'s fine if there\'s a particularly extensive
US-China relationship]{.underline}? I [don\'t know that]{.underline}
[China buying a lot of agricultural products from the United States is
necessarily a point of strategic vulnerability for us.]{.underline} I
think, if anything, it [testifies to a strategic vulnerability of
China\']{.underline}s, which is that they are highly dependent on
imports of food and other goods from abroad.

### AT: Unsustainable -- Afghanistan

#### Afghanistan wasn't a failure or a litmus test for hegemonic decline -- net success and biased hindsight prove

**Kagan 21** -- *Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution; adjunct
professor at Georgetown* (Robert, 8-26-2021, \"Opinion: It wasn't hubris
that drove America into Afghanistan. It was fear,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/26/robert-kagan-afghanistan-americans-forget/)//KH

Americans long remembered where they were when they learned about the
sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. The shock and horror of that event, in
which a German submarine deliberately sank a British ocean liner with
nearly 2,000 men, women and children aboard, produced more than moral
outrage. It also reshaped Americans' perception of the world and their
role in it, ultimately leading them into the First World War. But
neither their outrage at Germany nor their reconfigured view of foreign
policy lasted very long. Ten years later, [Americans still remembered
the Lusitania, but they did not remember why they went to war --- or,
more specifically, how they felt about the series of events, beginning
with the sinking, that ultimately led them to embrace war as their only
remaining option.]{.underline} Instead, they came to regret their
intervention in that war and to wonder what or, rather, who had gotten
them into it.

[Americans have undergone a similar experience over the two decades
since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001]{.underline}. The
[feelings and perceptions of threat that led them to war in Afghanistan
have faded, and all that is left are the consequences of that
decision]{.underline}, the costs in lives and money, the inevitably
mixed and uncertain results, and the unanswerable question: Was it all
worth it?

We live history forward, in the chaos of onrushing events, without a
clear guide. [But we judge history backward, smugly armed with the
knowledge of what did happen and uninterested in what might have
happened. This partly explains the oscillation of U.S. foreign policy
over the decades between periods of high involvement overseas and
periods of withdrawal and retrenchment]{.underline}. In the case of
World War I, the recoiling from what came to be regarded as the great
error of intervention led to two decades in which Americans so removed
themselves from involvement in Europe and East Asia that they
unwittingly helped bring about the next great war they would once again
be dragged into fighting. One wonders whether this pattern will
eventually repeat itself in Afghanistan.

[A collective failure today to recall what the world looked like to
Americans after 9/11 has certainly clouded our understanding of the
consequential decisions t]{.underline}aken in those first years. Today,
[one reads that Americans went to war "almost gleefully"]{.underline};
that in launching the intervention, President George W. Bush was filled
with "optimism" based on the belief that "democracy would flourish when
given the opportunity"; that "imperial hubris" led Americans to believe
"that we could shape the world in our image using our guns and our
money." Today, we read that even as "the twin towers and the Pentagon
were still smoldering, there was a sense among America's warrior and
diplomatic class that history was starting anew for the people of
Afghanistan and much of the Muslim world.

[This is a myth, or to use the term preferred by The Post's extensive
report on Afghanistan, a "lie." For better or for worse, it was fear
that drove the United States into Afghanistan --- fear of another attack
by al-Qaeda]{.underline}, which was then firmly ensconced in the
Taliban-controlled country; [fear of possible attacks by other groups
using chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons; fear of other
sleeper cells already hiding in the United States. Experts warned that
it was just a matter of time before the next big attack. And these fears
persisted.]{.underline}

A year after 9/11, a Pew Research Center poll found that [the attacks
had "left a lasting, perhaps indelible, imprint on life in America as
well as on attitudes toward public policy."]{.underline} More than 6 in
[10 Americans worried about a new attack; 4 in 10 expected the
terrorists to use chemical or biological weapons; and more than half of
Americans believed the perpetrators of the next attack were already
living in the United States.]{.underline} Women worried more than men,
with the result that women were, suddenly, about as likely as men to
favor increased defense spending and military action. By a margin of 48
percent to 29 percent, Americans agreed that increasing the U.S.
military presence abroad was a more effective means of combating
terrorism than decreasing it. A month before Bush went to Congress for
authorization to use force in Iraq, [64 percent of Americans polled
favored using military force to remove Saddam Hussein from
power.]{.underline}

Th[e decision to go to war in Afghanistan in October 2001 enjoyed almost
universal support --- authorizations were approved in September 98 to 0
in the Senate and 420 to 1 in the House.]{.underline} But there was no
gleeful optimism about the likely outcome. [A month into the war, 88
percent of Americans polled approved of the intervention, but only 40
percent thought it very likely that the United States would be able to
drive the Taliban from power]{.underline}, and only 28 percent thought
it very likely that the United States would capture or kill Osama bin
Laden. This pessimism persisted, thanks in part to the continual
warnings by experts and many in government that terrorist networks were
growing, along with the chances of another attack. In 2006, these
experts were still warning that it was "not over yet" and that Americans
remained "all too vulnerable to another 9/11-like tragedy at the hands
of the jihadists."

To read Bob Woodward's almost contemporaneous account of the Bush
administration's reaction to the 9/11 attacks is to read not of hubris
but of panic, confusion, fear and guilt[. Bush and his advisers were
mortified that they had allowed this uniquely horrific attack on
American soil, and their focus was on punishing those who had
perpetrated it, as well as those who sheltered them.]{.underline} Bush
personally wanted vengeance. As Secretary of State Colin Powell thought
to himself, according to Woodward, Dan Balz and Jeff Himmelman, the
president "wanted to kill somebody." He wanted to do so for strategic
reasons, as a deterrent to others. He wanted to do so partly to buoy the
crushed spirits of Americans unaccustomed to being attacked. But he also
wanted to avenge the lives that had been lost on his watch.

Bush had no idea what he wanted to do with Afghanistan once that goal
had been accomplished. In truth, the Bush administration would have been
content with any stable government capable of fending for itself and
preventing the return of the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other terrorist
groups. Bush was hardly inclined toward "nation-building." On the
contrary, he and [national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and other
advisers had criticized the Clinton administration for precisely that
--- "international social work,"]{.underline} as one critic put it ---
and had come into office intending to pursue a far more restrained
foreign policy. Faced with the problem of Afghanistan, however, Bush
officials found themselves with only unpalatable choices. On the one
hand, historian Fredrik Logevall writes, "[they feared that Afghanistan
could descend into chaos," but on the other hand, they "didn't want to
be saddled with the tasks of nation-building."]{.underline} Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, writes historian and former civilian
adviser in Afghanistan Carter Malkasian, "wanted to outsource to Afghan
partners and be done with the place as soon as possible." In the end[,
Bush officials decided they had no choice but to stay for a while and
try to establish a government that would allow American troops
eventually to depart without fear of a return to the pre-9/11
circumstances.]{.underline}

This led them into efforts that could be described as "nation-building"
but that were basically what the U.S. military has always done, or tried
to do, when engaged in occupations in Vietnam and in the Balkans in the
20th century, in Cuba and the Philippines decades before that, and even
in the South after the Civil War. Building schools and hospitals, trying
to reduce corruption and improve local administration --- this has been
standard operating procedure following nearly all U.S. interventions.

But the idea that Americans sought nothing less than creating a "Western
democracy\" rather than "what was sustainable or workable in an Afghan
context" is simply wrong. [The word "democracy" does not once appear in
Balz and Woodward's eight-part series in 2002. Top officials knew that
even bringing stability to Afghanistan was going to be a tall
order.]{.underline} When someone suggested that at least it would be
easier than dealing with the Balkans, with their centuries-old religious
and ethnic conflicts, Rice responded, "We're going to wish this was the
Balkans."

The United States turned toward nation-building in Afghanistan not
because officials were confident of success but because it seemed the
least bad of the available options. Nor were these efforts slipped past
an American public kept in the dark. One year into the war, 56 percent
of Americans favored "coming to the aid of Afghanistan to help it
recover from the war," and fully two-thirds agreed that the United
States would have to continue to "deploy troops there to maintain civil
order" for the foreseeable future. And still Americans remained doubtful
and apprehensive. A year into the war, only 15 percent regarded it as
successful; 12 percent called it a failure. And 70 percent thought it
was too early to tell. Only a third of the public believed that
terrorists were less able to launch a new attack than they had been a
year earlier.

Bush was hardly the sunny cheerleader. From the beginning, he worried
that Americans were not prepared for the long and difficult struggle
ahead. "Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and
isolated strikes," he told Congress in the days after Sept. 11.
"Americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign unlike
any other we have ever seen." Certainly, in those first few years after
9/11, that was indeed what Americans expected --- a long, nasty conflict
with many casualties on both sides. But they regarded it as necessary.
Bush never considered simply declaring victory and bringing the troops
home. He has said that an option of "attack, destroy the Taliban,
destroy al-Qaeda as best we could, and leave" was never appealing
because "that would have created a vacuum \[in\] which ... radicalism
could become even stronger." His successors all faced the same dilemma.
As Malkasian observed last year, "Ev[ery U.S. president since 2001 ...
sought to reach a point in Afghanistan when the violence would be
sufficiently low or the Afghan government strong enough to allow U.S.
military forces to withdraw without significantly increasing the risk of
a resurgent terrorist threat.]{.underline}"

[That is one reason the intervention lasted so long. Another reason was
that it was not all one steady downward spiral to failure]{.underline}.
There were periods when the situation looked to be more or less under
control. After the rapid rout of the Taliban in the fall of 2001,
Afghanistan became deceptively peaceful for roughly four years. Bush was
able to keep between 10,000 and 20,000 troops in the country, and U.S.
casualties in these years were relatively low. On the political front,
there was progress to point to: In January 2004, Afghan leaders approved
a new constitution, which led to reasonably fair presidential and
parliamentary elections and the election of the moderate Hamid Karzai as
president. Afghanistan was still far from a "success," but the progress
was enough that the Bush team kept at it, especially given what the
administration regarded as the likely consequences of withdrawal. As one
Marine and intelligence officer who served five tours of duty in Iraq
and Afghanistan recently put it, "At any given point in our 20-year
Afghan odyssey, we were always --- in our minds, at least --- only a
year or two out from a drawdown followed by an eventual withdrawal."

But progress could never be sustained. The rise of a Taliban insurgency
in the last years of the Bush administration led President Barack Obama
to accept his military advisers' recommendation for a "surge" of forces
in 2009. There followed another period of relative progress. Over the
next three years, the surge stabilized important parts of the country,
breathed new life into the Afghan army and police, and strengthened
support for the government. The costs to the United States went up,
however. It was during the Obama surge that American casualties were at
their highest --- 1,500 troops killed and 15,000 wounded between 2009
and 2012, more than in any other period of the 20-year war. The killing
of bin Laden in May 2011 led most Americans to believe that the mission
had been accomplished, and Obama started speaking about the need to
"focus on nation building here at home." But as Obama withdrew the
troops sent in for the surge and planned further drawdowns, the Taliban
recovered, and outside Afghanistan the general terrorist threat
increased with the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Much has been made of the supposed deception that successive
administrations engaged in to make the situation look better than it
was. But [the suggestion that three consecutive administrations "hid the
truth for two decades" is simply not true. Even when American officials
tried to put the best face on a bad situation, they didn't pretend there
was no bad news.]{.underline} Consider the testimony of [Gen. David
Petraeus in March 2011]{.underline}. He told Congress optimistically
that "the past eight months have seen important but hard-fought
progress," as indeed they had. But he also [said that progress remained
"fragile and reversible," that "much difficult work" lay ahead, and that
there had been "setbacks as well as successes."]{.underline}

Any cautious optimism advanced by successive administrations was more
than matched by members of Congress from both parties. At the same
hearing where Petraeus testified, Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) reported, on the basis of his own visit to
Afghanistan in January 2011, that the Afghan people in former Taliban
strongholds were "returning to villages" and had "growing confidence in
the ability of Afghan and coalition forces to provide security." Members
of Congress, and especially Democrats, were also enthusiastic about
nation-building. Congress repeatedly demanded greater civilian efforts
to complement military action, approving billions of dollars in aid and
constantly pressing the administration to beef up such efforts. This aid
also enjoyed public support. If nation-building in Afghanistan was a
mistake, it was a mistake that lots of people made.

[The fact was, no one was under any illusions, then or later, that an
outright victory was close at hand. Even as Petraeus was making his
highly qualified assessment of progress, U.S. intelligence officials
were also testifying publicly on their concerns about whether the Afghan
government had the ability to take over responsibility for
governing.]{.underline} The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency
observed at the time that, despite the surge of U.S. troops, there had
been "no apparent degradation in" the Taliban's "capacity to fight" and
that its forces remained "resilient" and would be "able to threaten U.S.
and international goals in Afghanistan through 2011."

[The notion that Americans were duped into believing that all was well
in Afghanistan is belied by polls throughout the war. Only a small
minority ever said they were "confident" that U.S. policies in
Afghanistan would eventually succeed. In the summer of 2005, 75 percent
were either "not confident" or "not sure." Five years later, in 2010,
that share was up to over 80 percent,]{.underline} while only 12 percent
expressed confidence.

Yet [despite this, a majority of Americans consistently supported
continued involvement, and in 2009 a substantial majority supported
Obama's dramatic increase in troops]{.underline}. Indeed, voters had a
higher opinion of Obama's Afghanistan policy than of his handling of the
economy and health care. Like the administration, the public and
Congress knew the war wasn't going particularly well but opposed
departing and favored a greater U.S. commitment. By and large, Americans
were all in it together, even if most have a hard time remembering that
now.

From the beginning, [the effort in Afghanistan faced severe constraints,
many self-imposed.]{.underline} Afghanistan was a classic case, repeated
many times throughout American history, of a United States with one foot
out the door from the moment of intervention. This started with the Bush
administration. The common theme of Afghanistan and Iraq was the belief
by Rumsfeld and his subordinates that both interventions could be
sustained without a large commitment of U.S. forces. Perhaps this belief
could be attributed to hubris, but it was really just an effort to keep
the American footprint to a minimum. Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the commander
of coalition forces in Afghanistan in 2002-2003, told government
interviewers that his superiors at the Pentagon mainly cared about
keeping a lid on the number of deployed U.S. troops. Rumsfeld in
particular would become exercised at any mention of additional forces.
Some argued for more troops, but as Richard Haass, who was one of them,
later recounted, "[There was a profound sense of a lack of possibility
in Afghanistan." Instead, as in Iraq, the Pentagon worked to build an
Afghan army capable of taking over. U.S. officials tended both to
inflate the numbers and exaggerate the capabilities of the Afghan
army]{.underline}. Why? To demonstrate that there was no need for more
American troops or a more extended commitment. When the British
commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan told Rumsfeld in 2006 that "we
don't have enough troops and resources," Rumsfeld responded, "General, I
don't agree. Move on."

Whatever chance of success the United States might have had was not
improved by this half-in/half-out approach. The Taliban could see how
eager the Americans were to get out and so bided its time. But as
significant was the effect on America's partners in Afghanistan. [The
very uncertainty of the American commitment worked at cross-purposes
with the effort to build a government and an army that could stand on
their own]{.underline}. As one American who served in Afghanistan has
pointed out, one of the consequences was to increase corruption. "[Our
consistent **messaging that we were on our way out** of Afghanistan
encouraged Afghans in positions of power to embrace
corruption]{.underline} --- specifically, the siphoning of resources for
personal gain --- as the one clear and sure means of survival.
Corruption became a financial contingency plan, the choice any
reasonable Afghan would make to ensure a safe future for their
children." [Afghan fighters also had to make choices. They had barely
held on in the fight against the Taliban with American help, including
air support; why imagine that they could hold on without it? No one in
the U.S. government ever believed the Afghan army was ready to stand on
its own.]{.underline} Officials misjudged only the rapidity of its
collapse, which proved embarrassing but should not have been surprising.
In any case, it seems a bit unfair to say that America's Afghan partners
were simply "rotten." [Their lives depended on making the right judgment
about American staying power, and that was always in doubt.]{.underline}

And it was not just the Afghans who had to make such calculations[.
Among the biggest obstacles to U.S. policy was Pakistan's continuing
support for the Taliban. Top Pakistani officials made no secret of the
fact that they were hedging their bets.]{.underline} As the head of the
Pakistani intelligence service told then-Ambassador Ryan Crocker, one
day "you'll be done with us, but we're still going to be here ... and
the last thing we want with all of our other problems is to have turned
the Taliban into a mortal enemy, so, yes, we're hedging our bets." As
Crocker said in 2016, the only way to have compelled a different set of
calculations would have been to make clear that there was no calendar
for withdrawal, that the United States was prepared to keep its forces
in Afghanistan for as long as necessary. As Crocker put it, "[Americans
are short-term. Our adversaries count on that, and our allies fear
it."]{.underline} [One can only wonder how the various actors might have
responded had the Bush administration and its successors said the United
States was prepared to stay in Afghanistan for 20 years, instead of
spending 20 years with one foot always out the door]{.underline}.

The further irony is that [Americans have maintained troops in other
countries for decades. They have kept troops in Korea for 70 years,
guarding against the resumption of a war that has never formally ended
and that could erupt again at any moment. They have kept American troops
on the front lines of the Cold War in Europe and elsewhere in Asia for
even longer. There were American forces in the Balkans for more than a
decade.]{.underline} The fact is, [Americans will keep troops in distant
theaters for decades, so long as casualties are minimal.]{.underline}

Could things have gone differently in Afghanistan? Possibly, although
that seems unlikely given the proclivities of all the parties involved.
Successive U.S. administrations believed the likely price of lasting
success in Afghanistan was higher than the American people wanted to
pay, especially as the fear and anger after 9/11 faded. But the price of
withdrawal was also too high. Under the circumstances, it was not
surprising that successive presidents chose the route they did. And
though there can be much second-guessing about both strategy and
tactics, this was not one of those cases where the answer was obvious
and only ideologues could not see it. So why the brutal recriminations?
[Why does every American setback have to be a morality tale, **a search
for scapegoats and an indictment of American foreign policy in
general**]{.underline}? The United States intervened in Afghanistan for
perfectly good and understandable reasons after 9/11 and then did not
know how to extricate itself with an acceptable outcome. Why has this
been treated by so many as a tale of sin and hubris? [Why has the "war
on terror" come to be viewed as a symptom and for some the source of
much of America's troubles today?]{.underline}

In fact, [the "war on terror" has been successful --- astoundingly so.
If you had told anyone after 9/11 that there would not be another major
attack on the U.S. homeland for 20 years, few would have believed it
possible]{.underline}. The prevailing wisdom at the time was that not
only would there be other attacks, but they would be more severe. In
2004, Harvard's premier foreign policy expert, [Graham Allison,
predicted that it was "more likely than not" that terrorists would
explode a nuclear weapon in the United States in the coming
decade.]{.underline} What former Obama and current Biden officials Rob
Malley and Jon Finer observed three years ago remains true today: "[No
group or individual has been able to repeat anything close to the
devastating scale of the 9/11 attacks in the United States or against
U.S. citizens abroad, owing to the remarkable efforts of U.S.
authorities,]{.underline} who have disrupted myriad active plots and
demolished many terrorist cells and organizations."

That this fact is rarely noted as Americans argue about Afghanistan is
remarkable. Does anyone think these efforts would have been as
successful if after 9/11 the United States had left the Taliban and
al-Qaeda in place for all these years? And [it is interesting that so
many Americans now believe the price has been too high. As often
happens, the fact that the United States hasn't been hit again tends to
reinforce the idea that there never was a serious threat to begin
with]{.underline}, certainly not serious enough to warrant paying such a
price. But [this is again the difference between living history forward
and judging history backward. If someone had told Americans after 9/11
that they could go two decades without another successful attack but
that it would cost 4,000 American lives and \$1 trillion, as well as
tens of thousands of Afghan lives, would they have rejected it as too
high?]{.underline} Likely not.

When Americans went to war in 2001, most believed that the dangers of
inaction had become too great, that threats of both international
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction were growing, and that serious
efforts had to be made to address them. Today, many Americans
increasingly believe that those earlier perceptions were mistaken or
perhaps even manufactured. With America's departure from Afghanistan, we
may begin to learn who was more right.

### Russia revisionist

#### Neither US influence nor NATO expansion are the cause of Russian aggression -- Putin is ideologically revisionist, proven by Russian history

**Brands 22** -- *Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments*. (Hal, 15
March, 2022, \"Putin's Biggest Lie: Blaming NATO for His War,\"
https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/3532081/hal-brands/putin%E2%80%99s-biggest-lie-blaming-nato-his-war)//KH

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, US officials
and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the post-Cold War
peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have charged that
Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the aggressive
expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

[The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the US threw it all away]{.underline}. Rather than
conciliating a defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by
expanding a vast military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into
the former Soviet Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a
liberal-democratic guise eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. [Putin's wars are indeed meant, in
part, to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the
idea that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.]{.underline}

Far from being a historic blunder, NATO expansion was one of the great
American successes of the post-Cold War era. Far from being the act of a
domineering superpower, it was part of a long tradition of vulnerable
states begging to join America's liberal empire. And far from posing a
mortal threat to Moscow, NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with
far greater security than it could have provided itself.

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember something
that nearly everyone has now forgotten: There was no guarantee that
Europe would be mostly stable, peaceful and democratic after the Cold
War. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO expansion as a
catastrophe once warned that a post-Cold War Europe could become a
violent hellscape.

It wasn't an outlandish scenario. A reunified Germany might once again
try to dominate its neighbors; the old enmity between Moscow and Berlin
could reignite. The collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe could
liberate those states to pursue long-suppressed territorial claims and
nationalist agendas. Ethnic tensions and nuclear proliferation might
explode as the Cold War order crumbled.

[If the US pulled back once the Soviet threat was gone, there would be
no extra-European superpower to put out fires on a continent with lots
of geopolitical kindling.]{.underline} "The prospect of major crises,
even wars, in Europe is likely to increase dramatically," Mearsheimer
predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the logical answer to these fears. Expansion was a
way of binding a reunified Germany to the West and surrounding it with
democratic allies.]{.underline} Joining NATO required new members to lay
aside any revanchist designs, while allowing them to pursue economic and
political reforms rather than investing heavily in military capabilities
to defend their newly won autonomy.

NATO's move to the east also ensured that Poland and other states that
easily could have built nuclear weapons didn't need to, because they had
American protection. Most important, enlargement kept the US firmly
planted in Europe, by preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic
relationship from becoming obsolete.

No other initiative could have accomplished these objectives.
Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose security cooperation
agreements with former Soviet-bloc states --- didn't offer the ironclad
guarantees that came with NATO membership. (If you want to understand
the difference between "security partner" and "NATO ally," just look at
what is happening today to Ukraine, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power and promises could provide stability in Europe, and
NATO was the continent's critical link to the US]{.underline}. Since
1949, [Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as
France and Germany, while also protecting them from external
threats]{.underline}. After 1991, NATO expansion took this zone of
peace, prosperity and cooperation that had emerged in Western Europe and
moved it into Eastern Europe as well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "[Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier,]{.underline}" protecting the continent from
dangers within and without.

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the US exploited the
Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits such
as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a country
whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy undermined
by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all [policies have costs. The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites --- although we often forget that
Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian President
Boris Yeltsin]{.underline}, bringing Russia into elite Western
institutions such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in
the intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. Yet the cost of not expanding
NATO might have been forfeiting much of the stability that initiative
provided. [Trade-offs are inevitable in foreign policy: There was no
magic middle path that would have provided all the benefits with none of
the costs.]{.underline}

Second[, if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably benign and consensual form of empire]{.underline}.
[When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did so at the urging of
the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians.]{.underline} The Baltic countries and
others were soon banging at the door. The states of Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union were desperate to join America's sphere of
influence, because they were desperate to leave Moscow's.

This, too, was part of an older pattern: The [US has often extended its
influence by "invitation" rather than imposition. The creation of NATO
in 1949 was **mostly a European idea**:]{.underline} Countries that were
terrified of Moscow sought protection from Washington. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the US empire has trouble keeping members
out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet [this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. After the Cold War, America steadily
withdrew most of its troops and all of its heavy armor from the
continent. US allies engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Part of the answer is that [NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad.]{.underline} The Soviet Union, and the Russian
empire before it, had traditionally sought to control countries along
their frontiers and used brutal means to do it. To say that NATO
expansion caused Russian belligerence is thus [to make an extremely
dubious assertion: that absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
satisfied, status quo power.]{.underline}

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, [safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire.]{.underline} For 20 years, [Putin has been publicly lusting
after the sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once
enjoyed]{.underline}. NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by
giving Moscow's former vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO also threatened a certain type of Russian government --- an
autocracy that was never secure in its own rule.]{.underline} A
democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded being neighbors with
Western-leaning democracies, because political liberty in those
countries wouldn't have threatened to set a subversive example for
anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a US-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

To be sure, US officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia was
prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength[, US officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance]{.underline}, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving
Putin both the pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by
tearing those two countries apart.

Yet [there is a curious morality in accounts that blame the West, which
sought to protect vulnerable states in Eastern Europe, for the current
carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who has worked to dismember and
intimidate those countries.]{.underline} It is sloppy thinking to tally
up the costs of NATO expansion without considering the historic
achievements of a policy that served American, European and even certain
Russian interests remarkably well.

And if nothing else, [NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold
War]{.underline} --- a factor of great significance now that a second
cold war is underway.

The [legacy of NATO expansion isn't simply a matter of historical
interest. Americans' understanding of the past has always influenced
their view of what policies to pursue in the future]{.underline}. During
the 1920s and 1930s, the widespread, if inaccurate, belief that America
had entered World War I to serve the interests of banks and arms
manufacturers had a paralyzing effect on US policy amid the totalitarian
aggression that set off World War II.

Today, the US faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's imperial
project and protect an endangered world order. Introspection is an
admirable quality, but the last thing America needs is another bout of
self-flagellation rooted in another misapprehension of the past.

#### Russian and Chinese revisionism on a double front proves now is critical for the US to leverage its ample capabilities to hedge back

**Brands 22** -- *Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor of Global
Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies
and a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute* (Hal,
2-25-2022, \"The Eurasian Nightmare,\" Foreign Affairs,

[The greatest strategic problem the United States faces is the
convergence of its two main rivals, China and
Russia]{.underline}---[countries that don't always like or trust each
other but nonetheless derive great benefits from their simultaneous
assaults on the existing international order]{.underline}. And as Moscow
and Beijing contest the balance of power at both ends of Eurasia[, they
are drawing together in ominous ways.]{.underline}

[China has refused to condemn Russia\'s brazen invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline} Instead, [on the day of Russia\'s attack, it
accused the United States and its allies of "fanning the
flames."]{.underline} China's non-denunciation is [part of a broader
pattern of Sino-Russian convergence, as both Beijing and Moscow are
using old and new methods to upend the global status quo.]{.underline}
In January 2022, China publicly supported Russia's intervention in
Kazakhstan to thwart a "color revolution" in the two countries' shared
backyard. In early February, Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a long joint statement endorsing
efforts to keep U.S. influence out of their near abroads, attacking the
United States' alliances as Cold War relics, defending their own
autocratic models of government, and declaring that Sino-Russian
friendship has "no limits." All of this follows significant, sustained
upticks in military, economic, diplomatic, and technological
cooperation. Expect more in the future: as [Russia's invasion of Ukraine
crystallizes tensions between Putin and the West, it also underscores
his need for support from Beijing.]{.underline}

[The Sino-Russian convergence gives both powers more room for maneuver
by magnifying Washington's two-front problem: the United States now
faces increasingly aggressive near-peer rivals in two separate
theaters---eastern Europe and the western Pacific]{.underline}---that
are thousands of miles apart. [Sino-Russian cooperation, while fraught
and ambivalent, raises the prospect that America's two great-power
rivalries could merge into a single contest against an autocratic
axis]{.underline}. Even short of that, the current situation has revived
the great geopolitical nightmare of the modern era: [an authoritarian
power or entente that strives for dominance in Eurasia, the central
strategic theater of the world.]{.underline}

That nightmare traces back to the writings of the political geographer
Halford Mackinder, who warned in 1904 that the coming era would feature
high-stakes struggles to rule Eurasia and its surrounding oceans. That
prophesy played out in the two cataclysmic hot wars and one global cold
war that followed. Mackinder's vision has become newly relevant in the
twenty-first century: [the United States' rivals are working to create a
radically revised global order with an autocratic Eurasia at its
core.]{.underline}

THE HEART OF THE WORLD

Mackinder is considered by many to be the father of geopolitics, and
argued in his famous "heartland" theory of political geography (as well
as subsequent publications) that three revolutions were putting Eurasia
at center stage in global affairs. First, the colonization of Africa and
much of Asia meant that possibilities for easy imperial expansion were
fading, presaging fiercer fights between great powers in Eurasia, the
world's geopolitical core. Second, the proliferation of railroads was
making it possible to project power across vast territories and creating
new opportunities for conquest on the Eurasian landmass. Third,
illiberal states were harnessing rapidly industrializing economies to
underwrite horrific repression at home and dramatic expansion abroad. If
such states were able to dominate Eurasia, global supremacy would be
within their reach.

[Eurasia, Mackinder pointed out, controlled most of the world's
population and industrial potential. A power or coalition that gained
control of Eurasia's resources could then build unrivaled navies and
expand its empire across the seas.]{.underline} The coming [geopolitical
dramas would thus play out on and around this vital
landmass.]{.underline} [Autocratic bids for expansion would trigger
fights with coalitions linking offshore powers---the United Kingdom and
later the United States]{.underline}---[to onshore allies]{.underline}
whose existence would be threatened by a Eurasian hegemon.

Mackinder got plenty wrong: the big challenges to Eurasian equilibrium
initially came not from Russia, as he had expected, but from Germany and
Japan. This led the strategist Nicholas Spykman to argue that the
supercontinent's crucial theaters were its European and East Asian
"rimlands" rather than its Russian "heartland." But [Mackinder nailed
the basic pattern. The three great showdowns of the twentieth
century---World War I, World War II, and the Cold War---were brawls
between autocratic states, which sought to dominate huge swaths of
Eurasia and its adjoining oceans]{.underline}, and the amphibious
alliances, anchored by London and then Washington, which sought to
contain them.

The contours of these contests changed over time. Germany and Japan
pursued outright conquest, often by exploiting new technologies---tanks
and tactical airpower, submarines and aircraft carriers---to project
power on an unprecedented scale. During the Cold War, nuclear stalemate
led the Soviet Union to rely mostly on military intimidation, political
subversion, and proxy forces. Yet the stakes remained the same: U.S.
policymakers, from Woodrow Wilson to George Kennan, understood that a
hostile, autocratic Eurasia would fundamentally reshape the globe. And
after a brief, post--Cold War respite, the United States confronts a new
version of the old nightmare today.

HEGEMONIC GAMBITS

The [present Sino-Russian partnership naturally invites comparison to
the Sino-Soviet alliance during the Cold War]{.underline}. But a better
analogy might be Germany and Japan before World War II. Though formally
allied, Tokyo and Berlin were ambivalent, distrustful partners with
fundamentally different long-term visions. Nonetheless, each was
committed to overthrowing the existing order, and each profited from the
chaos created by the other's advances.

Presently, [neither China nor Russia has engaged in anything approaching
World War II--scale aggression]{.underline}. But b[oth countries
fundamentally resent the U.S.-led international order because American
influence obstructs their paths to domination in world affairs, and
because the liberal principles enshrined in the international system are
at odds with the illiberal orders that their leaders have constructed at
home]{.underline}. China and Russia may be pursuing distinct agendas,
but together they present a comprehensive challenge to the geopolitical
balance in Eurasia and beyond.

Moscow and Beijing are drawing together in ominous ways.

[China's capabilities are greater than Russia's, which makes its efforts
more audacious. Beijing aims to excise U.S. power from maritime Asia in
order to consolidate a Chinese sphere of influence encompassing much of
the Western Pacific]{.underline}. China is simultaneously [reaching into
Eurasia through investment and infrastructure programs, such as the Belt
and Road Initiative and the Digital Silk Road,]{.underline} that [cast
its economic, political, and military influence into Southeast Asia,
Central Asia, and regions]{.underline} further afield. In short,
[Beijing is looking for hybrid hegemony]{.underline} on land and at sea.

[China's gambit intersects with Russia's efforts to revise the status
quo]{.underline}. For years, [Putin has been vying to reestablish
Russian primacy from Central Asia to eastern Europe. Putin seems to
envision a Europe in which NATO is effectively rolled back to its Cold
War frontiers]{.underline} and its relationship with Washington is badly
weakened. As [Russia has recovered its strength after the early
post--Cold War era]{.underline}, Moscow has [also projected power into
the Artic, North Atlantic, Middle East]{.underline}, and other flanking
theaters. [Moscow has no hope of building a Russo-centric global order,
but it can weaken the existing system from one direction as China
attacks it from others.]{.underline}

As they have throughout the past century, [attempts at Eurasian
expansion reflect the shifting nature of global power. Beijing's
record-shattering naval buildup, Moscow's serial aggression against
disobedient neighbors, and both countries' efforts to fundamentally
upend the military balance in key regions such as eastern Europe and
East Asia show that hard power hasn't gone out of style]{.underline}.
And both [countries are also using more novel methods]{.underline} to
weaken their rivals and spread their influence: [Russian cyberattacks
and digital disinformation campaigns]{.underline} are the counterpart to
[China's infrastructure projects, efforts to control the world's 5G
networks, and other non-military measures that extend its global
sway]{.underline}.

TOGETHER, AND SEPARATE

Because [both China and Russia seek to break the existing order, it is
unsurprising that convergence has birthed cooperation]{.underline}. The
[two countries have reportedly swapped tips on how to manage the
Internet and control dissent at home;]{.underline} [they have also
worked,]{.underline} through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization[, to
fortify friendly dictators in Central Asia]{.underline}. The bilateral
[trade, finance, and energy relationship between China and Russia has
broadened,]{.underline} and Beijing and Moscow have [lent each other
important]{.underline}, if sometimes tacit, [diplomatic support in the
UN Security Council.]{.underline} Not least, an expanding [military
relationship features joint exercises in Central Asia and the Baltic and
South China Seas, transfers of weaponry, and burgeoning defense
technological cooperation,]{.underline} some of which is likely
happening in secret.

Yet formal cooperation between Beijing and Moscow is an insufficient
measure of their partnership, because [the two help each other simply by
pursuing their individual goals.]{.underline} When [China and Russia use
disinformation and strategic corruption to meddle in liberal
societies]{.underline}, or work to make international organizations
friendlier to illiberal rule, they contribute to a global autocratic
resurgence that benefits both states. And it is at the strategic level
where the payoffs of convergence are most pronounced.

Both [Beijing and Moscow seem to have learned a vital lesson from the
Soviet defeat in the Cold War: that it makes poor strategy to compete
with Washington on one front while antagonizing a second enemy on
another. China and Russia have thus resolved to stand "back to
back]{.underline}" along their shared Eurasian border, freeing them to
focus on eroding the U.S.-led order.

[Washington's rivals are working to create a revised global order with
an autocratic Eurasia at its core.]{.underline}

The Russian Far East, for instance, presently houses fewer military
assets than at any time since Nazi forces were at Moscow's gates in
1941, a testament to the way that reduced tensions with China enable
Russia to concentrate on intimidating the West. By the same token, [the
existence of simultaneous threats from China and Russia prevents
Washington from concentrating its power against either rival, and leaves
it vulnerable to being whipsawed by two separate competitors. The
Sino-Russian relationship isn't an alliance, but it doesn't need to be
one in order to cause strategic migraines for the United
States]{.underline}.

To be sure, the partnership suffers from real constraints. [China and
Russia are unlikely to come to each other's defense in a conflict with
Washington, although they might seek subtle ways---such as sharing
intelligence or posturing troops menacingly---to prevent the United
States from decisively defeating one opponent]{.underline} and then
homing in on the other. Russia, having invaded Ukraine and facing
comprehensive sanctions from the West, won't find equivalent economic
relief from Beijing, in part because China isn't eager to bring down the
financial wrath of the hegemon by engaging in sanctions-busting on a
massive scale. Tensions lurk in Central Asia, where both countries can't
be preeminent simultaneously; in the Arctic, where Russia is a resident
power and China is an interloper; and in Africa, where Moscow generates
instability that hardly improves prospects for repayment of Chinese
loans. Eventually, the overall clash of interests could be severe,
because Russia wouldn't particularly enjoy living in the Sinocentric
world that Xi envisions.

For the time being, however, [Washington's Eurasian predicament will
only get worse: threats to the existing order are intensifying, and its
opponents' bellicosity]{.underline} is increasing, on both sides of that
landmass at once. Although Xi\'s and Putin\'s ultimate objectives
diverge, their intermediate goals can keep them closely aligned for
years to come.

BREAKING THE GREAT-POWER TRIANGLE

[History suggests a solution to this predicament, but the obvious
answer---using concessions and diplomacy to turn Moscow against
Beijing---is the wrong one]{.underline}. Although the idea may tempt
observers in Washington and Europe who hope to improve the strategic
geometry of the great-power triangle, [Sino-Russian tensions aren't yet
sharp enough to produce the sort of split that happened in the late
1960s,]{.underline} and any efforts to purchase Moscow's cooperation
would surely backfire.

Putin has made clear that the price of sustained de-escalation with the
West is overturning the post--Cold War settlement in Europe---and if
Putin were offered such a deal, he might well conclude that his strategy
of pressure is working and push even harder. There is no diplomatic fix
to the Sino-Russian alignment that doesn't involve gravely weakening the
United States' position at one end of the Eurasian landmass. And it is
hard to imagine that an effective U.S. global strategy can withstand
such a blow.

A more useful lesson from history is that there may be no good
alternative to facing challenges on both sides of Eurasia at once. In
1940 and 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt declined the advice of those
who argued that he must appease Japan in order to concentrate on Nazi
Germany, because he recognized that both countries posed mortal threats
to the United States' vision for the international order. And later,
throughout the first two decades of the Cold War, the United States
sought to contain both China and the Soviet Union after concluding that
there was no acceptable way of separating them for the time being.

The United States confronts a new version of the old nightmare today.

[The United States and its allies have the raw power to pursue a similar
dual containment strategy today.]{.underline} As National Security
Adviser Jake Sullivan has noted, [even a more united Sino-Russian axis
would be dwarfed in economic, diplomatic, and military capabilities by
Washington and its allies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.]{.underline}

Granted, [the United States and its friends can't do this on the cheap.
Checking dual challenges would likely require major rearmament programs
and deeper cooperation against political and economic coercion, all
underpinned by a sharper awareness of the threat posed by China and
Russia's autocratic convergence.]{.underline} Put differently, it won't
work to pursue a Cold War--style strategy with post--Cold War levels of
urgency and investment. But the best way of resisting a familiar
challenge---a bloc of autocracies at the heart of Eurasia---is through a
familiar remedy: strengthening the collective resilience of the
countries holding the balance along its periphery.

This strategy may initially encourage Sino-Russian cooperation. Yet
history also suggests that driving ambivalent partners apart may first
require pushing them together. During the 1950s, the Eisenhower
administration wagered that a policy of pressure was more likely to
break the Sino-Soviet pact than one of inducement, because it would
force the weaker party---Beijing---into a position of reliance on the
stronger---Moscow---that would ultimately make both countries quite
uncomfortable. Eisenhower reasoned, correctly, that Washington might
someday find an opportunity to exploit tensions between its two enemies,
but only after it had shown that their partnership would produce more
misery than profit.

[If the United States is to promote an eventual strategic reorientation
in Moscow, it first must demonstrate that **Putin's policy of
revisionism** and alignment with Beijing is not working---and that the
alternative to decent relations with the West is an ever-greater
dependence on a China whose abrasiveness seems to grow with its
power]{.underline}. If that message can be driven home over a period of
years, [it could have a constructive effect on Russian
thinking]{.underline}, if not under Putin then under his successor. Such
an outcome may seem like a distant aspiration, which implies waging not
one but two cold wars along the way. If nothing else, then, [the
Sino-Russian convergence has clarified how serious the new Eurasian
challenge is---and what will be required to meet it.]{.underline}

### China revisionist

#### China is revisionist -- territorial expansion, 5-year plans, and anti-democratic innovation on all fronts

Enterprise Institute, associate professor at Tufts University* (Michael,
March/April 2022, \"Enemies of My Enemy,\" Foreign Affairs,

ENTER THE DRAGON

There has never been any doubt about what China wants, because [Chinese
leaders have declared the same objectives for decades: to keep the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in power, reabsorb Taiwan, control the
East China and South China Seas, and return China to its rightful place
as the dominant power in Asia]{.underline} and the most powerful country
in the world. For most of the past four decades, the country took a
relatively patient and peaceful approach to achieving these aims.
Focused on economic growth and fearful of being shunned by the
international community, China adopted a "peaceful rise" strategy,
relying primarily on economic clout to advance its interests and
generally following a maxim of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping: "Hide
your strength, bide your time."

In recent years, however, [China has expanded aggressively on multiple
fronts. "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy has replaced friendship diplomacy.
Perceived slights from foreigners, no matter how small, are met with
North Korean--style condemnation]{.underline}. A combative attitude has
seeped into every part of China's foreign policy, and it is confronting
many countries with their gravest threat in generations.

This threat is [most apparent in maritime East Asia, where China is
moving aggressively to cement its vast territorial claims. Beijing is
churning out warships faster than any country has since World War II,
and it has flooded Asian sea-lanes with Chinese coast guard and fishing
vessel]{.underline}s. It has [strung military outposts across the South
China Sea and dramatically increased its use of ship ramming and aerial
interceptions]{.underline} to shove neighbors out of disputed areas. In
the Taiwan Strait[, Chinese military patrols, some involving a dozen
warships and more than 50 combat aircraft, prowl the sea almost daily
and simulate attacks on Taiwanese and U.S. targets.]{.underline}
[Chinese officials have told Western analysts that calls for an invasion
of Taiwan are proliferating within the CCP.]{.underline} Pentagon
officials worry that such an assault could be imminent.

C[hina has gone on the economic offensive, too. Its latest five-year
plan calls for dominating what Chinese officials call
"chokepoints"---goods and services that other countries can't live
without]{.underline}---and then using that dominance, plus the lure of
China's domestic market, to browbeat countries into concessions. Toward
that end[, China has become the dominant dispenser of overseas loans,
loading up more than 150 countries with over \$1 trillion of
debt.]{.underline} It [has massively subsidized strategic industries to
gain a monopoly on hundreds of vital products, and it has installed the
hardware for digital networks in dozens of countries]{.underline}. Armed
with economic leverage, it has used coercion against more than a dozen
countries over the last few years. In many cases, the punishment has
been disproportionate to the supposed crime---for example, slapping
tariffs on many of Australia's exports after that country requested an
international investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

[China has also become a potent antidemocratic force, selling advanced
tools of tyranny around the world. By combining surveillance cameras
with social media monitoring, artificial intelligence, biometrics, and
speech and facial recognition technologies]{.underline}, the Chinese
government has pioneered a system that allows dictators to watch
citizens constantly and punish them instantly by blocking their access
to finance, education, employment, telecommunications, or travel. The
apparatus is a despot's dream, and Chinese companies are already selling
and operating aspects of it in more than 80 countries.

#### Western encirclement, aging populations, and attempted expansion prove China is a volatile revisionist power on the verge of lash-out

Red Flags

[Most debate on America\'s China policy focuses on the dangers of a
rising and confident China.]{.underline}3 But the [United States
actually faces a more complex and volatile threat]{.underline}: an
already [powerful but increasingly insecure China beset by internal
problems and a brewing international backlash]{.underline}.

[China already has the money and muscle to challenge the United
States]{.underline} in key areas. Thanks to decades of rapid growth[,
China boasts the world\'s largest economy]{.underline} (measured by
purchasing power parity), [manufacturing output, trade surplus,
financial reserves, navy by number of ships, and conventional missile
force]{.underline}. [Chinese nationals lead four of the 15 United
Nations specialized agencies.4 Chinese investments and loans span the
globe, and Beijing is pushing for primacy in key technologies such as 5G
telecommunications and artificial intelligence]{.underline} (AI).5 Add
in that the American-led world order has experienced four years of
geopolitical disarray under President Donald Trump and that much of the
world has suffered through many months of a crippling COVID-19 pandemic,
and it is [hardly surprising that Beijing is testing the status quo
everywhere from the South China Sea to the border with
China]{.underline}.

But [China\'s geopolitical window of opportunity may be closing as fast
as it opened. Since 2007, China\'s annual economic growth rate has
dropped by more than half]{.underline}, and [productivity has declined
by nearly 10 percent]{.underline}, meaning that [China is spending more
to produce less]{.underline}.6 Meanwhile, [debt has ballooned
eightfold]{.underline} and is on pace to total 335 percent of gross
domestic product by the end of 2020.7 No country has racked up so much
debt so fast in peacetime.

[China has little hope of reversing these trends, because it is about to
suffer the worst aging crisis in history]{.underline}. Over the next 30
years, [China will lose 200 million working-age adults and gain 300
million senior citizens]{.underline}./8 Any country that has aged,
accu-mulated debt, or lost productivity at anything close to China\'s
current pace has lost at least one decade to near-zero economic growth.
And [as economic growth falls, the dangers of social and political
unrest rise./9 China\'s leaders are well aware of these trends./10
President Xi Jinping has given multiple internal speeches warning party
members of the potential for a Soviet-style collapse./11 China\'s
gov-ernment has outlawed negative economic news, and Chinese elites are
moving their money and children out of the country en
masse./]{.underline}12

Meanwhile, [China faces a rising wave of foreign hostility. According to
leaked Chinese government reports and independent Western analyses,
nega-tive views of China have soared to highs not seen since the
Tiananmen Square massacre]{.underline} of 1989./13 This surge of
anti-China sentiment [is a response to Beijing\'s internal repression
and external assertiveness]{.underline}, and it is [now manifesting in
ways that threaten to crush China\'s geopolitical ambitions. Nearly a
dozen countries have suspended or canceled their participation in Belt
and Road Initiative projects]{.underline}./14 Another 16 countries,
including [eight of the world\'s 10 largest economies, have banned or
severely restricted use of Huawei products]{.underline} in their 5G
networks./15 [India has been turning hard against China,]{.underline}
since a clash between the two countries killed 20 soldiers in June.
[Japan has ramped up military spending, turned amphibious ships into
aircraft carriers,]{.underline} and strung missile launchers along the
Ryukyu Islands near Taiwan, where a record number of citizens now
identify solely as Taiwanese, not Chinese./[16 The European Union has
labeled China a \"systemic rival,\" and Europe\'s three great
powers\--France, Germany, and the United Kingdom\--are sending naval
patrols to counter Beijing\'s expansion]{.underline} in the South China
Sea and Indian Ocean./17

These [intensifying headwinds will make China a less competitive
long-term rival to the United States but a more explosive **near-term
threat**]{.underline}. Simply put, [it is hard to see how a country
facing so many severe challenges can ultimately outpace America and its
many allies.]{.underline} Yet whereas a rising [China could afford to
shelve disputes and deescalate crises]{.underline}\--confident that its
wealth, power, and status were growing and that the Chinese Communist
Party\'s (CCP) legitimacy was secure\--[a slowing and increasingly
encircled China will be eager to score geopolitical wins while it still
can.]{.underline} There is no mystery about what China\'s ambitions are,
because [the CCP has enshrined them in national law: to make the Chinese
nation whole again; reunite Taiwan with the mainland; control the East
and South China Seas, thereby turning the western Pacific into a Chinese
lake]{.underline}; and restore China\'s status as a great power. [The
looming danger is that China will act more aggressively to achieve
them]{.underline} as its future prospects dim.

History Rhymes

If China goes down this ugly path, it wouldn\'t be the first great power
to do so. [We tend to think that rising revisionists pose the greatest
danger to the existing order]{.underline}. \"[It was the rise of Athens
and the **fear that this inspired in Sparta** that made war
inevitable,\"]{.underline} Thucydides wrote. But historically, the most
desperate dashes have often come from dissatisfied powers that had been
on the ascent but grew worried that their time was running short./18

World War I is the classic example. The growing German challenge to the
United Kingdom provided the strategic background to that conflict. Yet
in the foreground in the run-up to 1914 were nagging German fears of
decline. The growth of Russian military power and strategic mobility was
menacing the eastern flank. New French conscription laws were changing
the balance in the west. A tightening Franco-Russian-British entente was
leaving Germany surrounded. If Berlin did not act quickly, its military
strategy\--based on fighting a two-front war\--would collapse, its
dreams of world power and geopolitical greatness would vanish, and the
internal strains caused by intensifying political clashes might become
unmanageable. This was a principal reason Berlin acted so recklessly
during the July crisis\--by issuing its \"blank check\" to
Austria-Hungary and then enacting its plan for a rapid, two-front
war\--despite the obvious peril, as Chief of General Staff Helmut von
Moltke acknowledged, of a continental war that might \"annihilate the
civilization of almost the whole of Europe for decades to come.\"/19

The same decision-making dynamics were present in other cases. Imperial
Japan made its fatal gamble in 1941, after the US oil embargo and naval
rearma-ment made it clear that Tokyo\'s window to dominate the
Asia-Pacific was closing fast./20 In the 1970s, Soviet global expansion
peaked as Moscow\'s military buildup matured and the slowing of the
Soviet economy created an impetus to lock in geopolitical gains sooner
than later. Even the United States once fit this pattern. The flurry of
American expansion and the buildup of US naval power in the 1890s came
after an economic slump that exacerbated internal tensions and amid a
global upsurge of imperial aggran-dizement that left some US strategists
concerned that Washington would be left behind by emerging European
mega-empires.

In some of these instances, [it was economic dis-tress following a long
period of growth that stoked anxious aggression. In others, it was the
onset of strategic encirclement, often self-provoked, by rival
powers]{.underline}. [In all cases, an upsurge in a revisionist state\'s
power gave it the means to challenge the status quo, but an apparent
downturn in its future prospects gave it the motive to do so boldly,
even violently]{.underline}. Given that C[hina is currently facing both
a grim economic forecast and tightening strategic encirclement, the next
few years may prove partic-ularly turbulent.]{.underline}/21

#### China is rising -- domestic and international infrastructure and agricultural exports outpace any other nation

**McCoy 22** -- *Alfred McCoy is the J.R.W. Smail Professor of History
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison* (Alfred, 2-25-2022, \"Will the
Fight for Hegemony Survive Climate Change?,\" Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-china-usa-beijing/)//KH

THE RISE OF CHINESE GLOBAL HEGEMONY

[China's rise to world power could be considered not just the result of
its own initiative but also of American inattention.]{.underline} While
[Washington was mired in endless wars]{.underline} in the Greater Middle
East in the decade [following the September 2001 terrorist attacks,
Beijing began using a trillion dollars of its swelling dollar reserves
to build a tricontinental economic infrastructure it called the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) that would shake the foundations of Washington's
world order.]{.underline} Not only has this scheme already [gone a long
way toward incorporating much of Africa and Asia into Beijing's version
of the world economy]{.underline}, but it has [simultaneously lifted
many millions out of poverty.]{.underline}

During the early years of the Cold War, Washington funded the
reconstruction of a ravaged Europe and the development of 100 new
nations emerging from colonial rule. But as the Cold War ended in 1991,
more than a [third of humanity was still living in extreme poverty,
abandoned by Washington's then-reigning neoliberal ideology that
consigned social change to the whims of the free market. By 2018, nearly
half the world's population,]{.underline} or about 3.4 billion people,
[were simply struggling to survive on the equivalent of five dollars a
day, creating a vast global constituency for Beijing's economic
leadership.]{.underline}

For China, social change began at home. Starting in the 1980s, the
[Communist Party presided over the transformation of an impoverished
agricultural society into an urban industrial powerhouse]{.underline}.
Propelled by the greatest mass migration in history, as millions moved
from country to city[, its economy grew nearly 10 percent annually for
40 years and lifted 800 million people out of poverty---the fastest
sustained rate ever recorded by any country.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
[between 2006 and 2016 alone, its industrial output increased from \$1.2
trillion to \$3.2 trillion, leaving the United States in the
dust]{.underline} at \$2.2 trillion and making China the workshop of the
world.

[By the time Washington awoke to China's challenge]{.underline} and
tried to respond with what President Barack Obama called a "strategic
pivot" to Asia, [it was too late]{.underline}. With foreign reserves
already at \$4 trillion in 2014, [Beijing launched its Belt and Road
Initiative, while establishing an Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank,]{.underline} with 56 member nations and an impressive \$100
billion in capital. When a Belt and Road Forum of 29 world leaders
convened in Beijing in May 2017, President Xi Jinping hailed the
[initiative as the "project of the century," aimed both at promoting
growth and improving "people's well-being" through "poverty
alleviation]{.underline}." Indeed, two years later a World Bank study
found that [BRI transportation projects]{.underline} had already
[increased the gross domestic product in 55 recipient nations by a solid
3.4 percent.]{.underline}

Amid this flurry of flying dirt and flowing concrete, [Beijing seems to
have an underlying design for transcending the vast distances that have
historically separated Asia from Europe]{.underline}. Its goal: [to
forge a unitary market that will soon cover the vast Eurasian land
mass]{.underline}. This scheme will consolidate China's control over a
continent that is home to 70 percent of the world's population and
productivity. In the end, it [could also break the US geopolitical grip
over a region that has long been the core of, and key to, its global
power.]{.underline} The fou[ndation for such an ambitious transnational
scheme is a monumental construction effort that in just two decades has
already covered China]{.underline} and much of Central Asia with a
massive triad of energy pipelines, high-speed rail lines, and highways.

To break that down, start with this: [Beijing is building a
transcontinental network of natural gas and oil pipelines that will, in
alliance with Russia, extend for 6,000 miles from the North Atlantic
Ocean to the South China Sea.]{.underline}

For the second arm in that triad, [Beijing has built the world's largest
high-speed rail system, with more than 15,000 miles already operational
in 2018 and plans for a network of nearly 24,000 miles by
2025]{.underline}. All this, in turn, [is just a partial step toward
what's expected to be a full-scale transcontinental rail system that
started with the "Eurasian Land Bridge"]{.underline} track running from
China through Kazakhstan to Europe. In addition to its transcontinental
trunk lines, [Beijing plans branch-lines heading due south toward
Singapore, southwest through Pakistan, and then from Pakistan through
Iran to Turkey.]{.underline}

To complete its transport triad, [China has also constructed an
impressive set of highways, representing]{.underline} (like those
pipelines) a problematic [continuation of Washington's current
petrol-powered world order]{.underline}. In [1990, that country lacked a
single expressway. By 2017, it had built 87,000 miles of highways,
nearly double the size of the US interstate system.]{.underline} Even
that breathtaking number can't begin to capture the extraordinary
engineering feats necessary---the tunneling through steep mountains, the
spanning of wide rivers, the crossing of deep gorges on towering
pillars, and the spinning of concrete webs around massive cities.

### Transition wars

#### Transition wars are likely -- escalation in the SCS and empirics prove

**Ferguson 21** -- *senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and managing
director of Greenmantle, a political-economic advisory firm* (Niall
Ferguson, 8-20-21, \"Niall Ferguson on why the end of America's empire
won't be peaceful,\" Economist,
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2021/08/20/niall-ferguson-on-why-the-end-of-americas-empire-wont-be-peaceful)//KH

The end of empires

[America's empire may not manifest itself as dominions, colonies and
protectorates, but the perception of international dominance, and the
costs associated with overstretch, are similar]{.underline}. Both left
and right in America now routinely ridicule or revile the idea of an
imperial project. "The American Empire is falling apart," gloats Tom
Engelhardt, a journalist in The Nation. On the right, the economist
Tyler Cowen sardonically imagines "what the fall of the American empire
could look like." At the same time as Cornel West, the progressive
African-American philosopher, sees "[Black Lives Matter and the fight
against US empire \[as\] one and the same", two pro-Trump Republicans,
Ryan James Girdusky and Harlan Hill, call the pandemic "the latest
example of how the American empire has no clothes."]{.underline}

The right still defends the traditional account of the republic's
founding---as a rejection of British colonial rule---against the \"woke"
left's attempts to recast American history as primarily a tale of
slavery and then segregation. But few on either side of the political
spectrum pine for the era of global hegemony that began in the 1940s.

In short, like Britons in the 1930s, Americans in the 2020s have fallen
out of love with empire---a fact that Chinese observers have noticed and
relish. Yet the empire remains. Granted, America has few true colonies:
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, Guam and the
Northern Mariana Islands in the north Pacific, and American Samoa in the
south Pacific. By British standards, it is a paltry list of possessions.
Nevertheless, the American military presence is almost as ubiquitous as
Britain's once was. American armed-forces personnel are to be found in
more than 150 countries. The total number deployed beyond the borders of
the 50 states is around 200,000.

The acquisition of such extensive global responsibilities was not easy.
But it is a delusion to believe that shedding them will be easier. This
is the lesson of British history to which Americans need to pay more
heed[. President Joe Biden's ill-advised decision for a "final
withdrawal" from Afghanistan was just the latest signal by an American
president that the country wants to reduce its overseas commitments.
Barack Obama began the process by exiting Iraq too hastily and
announcing in 2013 that "America is not the world\'s policeman." Donald
Trump's "America First" doctrine was just a populist version of the same
impulse:]{.underline} he too itched to get out of Afghanistan and to
substitute tariffs for counterinsurgency.

The problem, as this month's debacle in Afghanistan perfectly
illustrates, is that [the retreat from global dominance is rarely a
peaceful process]{.underline}. However you phrase it, announcing you are
[giving up on your longest war is an admission of defeat,]{.underline}
and not only in the eyes of the Taliban. China, which shares a short
stretch of its vast land border with Afghanistan, is also closely
watching. So is Russia, with zloradstvo---Russian for Schadenfreude. It
was [no mere coincidence that Russia intervened militarily in both
Ukraine and Syria just months after Obama's renunciation of global
policing.]{.underline}

Mr Biden's belief (expressed to Richard Holbrooke in 2010) that one
could exit Afghanistan as Richard Nixon exited Vietnam and "get away
with it" is bad history: America's humiliation in Indochina did have
consequences. It emboldened the Soviet Union and its allies to make
trouble elsewhere---in southern and eastern Africa, in Central America
and in Afghanistan, which it invaded in 1979. Reenacting the fall of
Saigon in Kabul will have comparable adverse effects.

The [end of American empire was not difficult to foresee, even at the
height of neoconservative hubris following the invasion of Iraq in
2003]{.underline}. There were at least four fundamental weaknesses of
America's global position at that time, as I first argued in "Colossus:
The Rise and Fall of America's Empire" (Penguin, 2004). [They are a
manpower deficit (few Americans have any desire to spend long periods of
time]{.underline} in places like Afghanistan and Iraq); [a fiscal
deficit]{.underline} (see above); [an attention deficit]{.underline}
(the electorate's [tendency to lose interest in any large-scale
intervention after roughly four years]{.underline}); and a [history
deficit (the reluctance of policymakers to learn lessons]{.underline}
from their predecessors, much less from other countries).

These were never deficits of British imperialism. One other
difference---in many ways more profound than the fiscal deficit---is the
negative net international investment position (NIIP) of the United
States, which is just under -70% of GDP. A negative NIIP essentially
means that foreign ownership of American assets exceeds American
ownership of foreign assets. By contrast, Britain still had a hugely
positive NIIP between the wars, despite the amounts of overseas assets
that had been liquidated to finance the first world war. From 1922 until
1936 it was consistently above 100% of GDP. By 1947 it was down to 3%.

Selling off the remaining imperial silver (to be precise, obliging
British investors to sell overseas assets and hand over the dollars) was
one of the ways Britain paid for the second world war. [America, the
great debtor empire, does not have an equivalent nest-egg]{.underline}.
It can afford to pay the cost of maintaining its dominant position in
the world only by selling yet more of its public debt to foreigners.
[That is a precarious basis for superpower status.]{.underline}

Facing new storms

Churchill's argument in "The Gathering Storm" was not that the rise of
Germany, Italy and Japan was an unstoppable process, condemning Britain
to decline. On the contrary, he insisted that war could have been
avoided if the Western democracies had taken more decisive action
earlier in the 1930s. When President Franklin Roosevelt asked him what
the war should be called, Churchill "at once" replied: "The Unnecessary
War."

In the same way, [there is nothing inexorable about China's rise, much
less Russia's,]{.underline} while all the lesser countries aligned with
them are economic basket cases, from North Korea to Venezuela. China's
population is ageing even faster than anticipated; its workforce is
shrinking. Sky-high private-sector debt is weighing on growth. Its
mishandling of the initial outbreak of covid-19 has greatly harmed its
international standing. It also risks becoming the villain of the
climate crisis, as it cannot easily kick the habit of burning coal to
power its industry.

And yet it is [all too easy to see a sequence of events unfolding that
could lead to another unnecessary war, most probably over
Taiwan]{.underline}, which Mr Xi covets and which America is
(ambiguously) committed to defend against invasion---[a commitment that
increasingly lacks credibility as the balance of military power shifts
in East Asia]{.underline}. (The [growing vulnerability of American
aircraft carriers to Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles such as the
DF-21D is just one problem]{.underline} to which the Pentagon lacks a
good solution.)

If [American deterrence fails and China gambles on a coup de main, the
United States will face the grim choice between fighting a long, hard
war]{.underline}---as Britain did in 1914 and 1939---[or
folding]{.underline}, as happened over Suez in 1956.

Churchill said that he wrote "The Gathering Storm" to show:

how the malice of the wicked was reinforced by the weakness of the
virtuous; how the structure and habits of democratic States, unless they
are welded into larger organisms, lack those elements of persistence and
conviction which can alone give security to humble masses; how, even in
matters of self-preservation ... the counsels of prudence and restraint
may become the prime agents of mortal danger ... \[how\] the middle
course adopted from desires for safety and a quiet life may be found to
lead direct to the bull's-eye of disaster.

He concluded the volume with one of his many pithy maxims: "Facts are
better than dreams." American leaders in recent years have become
over-fond of dreams, from the "full spectrum dominance" fantasy of the
neoconservatives under George W. Bush to the dark nightmare of American
"carnage" conjured up by Donald Trump. As another global storm gathers,
it may be time to face the fact that Churchill understood only too well:
[the end of empire is seldom, if ever, a painless process.]{.underline}

### AT: Multipolarity

#### Unipolarity is inevitable and multipolarity collapses into anarchy with a US-China rivalry

**Beckley 22** -- *Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, associate professor at Tufts University* (Michael,

THE CLASH OF SYSTEMS

[The history of international order building is one of savage
competition between clashing systems, not of harmonious
cooperation]{.underline}. In the best of times, that competition took
the form of a cold war, with each side jockeying for advantage and
probing each other with every measure short of military force. In many
cases, however, the competition eventually boiled over into a shooting
war and ended with one side crushing the other. [The victorious order
then ruled until it was destroyed by a new competitor---or until it
simply crumbled without an external threat to hold it
together.]{.underline}

Today, [a growing number of policymakers and pundits are calling for a
new concert of powers]{.underline} to sort out the world's problems and
divide the globe into spheres of influence. But [the idea of an
inclusive order in which no one power's vision prevails is a fantasy
that can exist only in the imaginations of world-government idealists
and academic theorists]{.underline}. [There are only two orders under
construction right now---a Chinese-led one and a U.S.-led one---and the
contest between the two is rapidly becoming a clash between autocracy
and democracy]{.underline}, as both countries define themselves against
each other and try to infuse their respective coalitions with
ideological purpose. [China is positioning itself as the world's
defender of hierarchy and tradition]{.underline} against a decadent and
disorderly West; [the United States is belatedly summoning a new
alliance to check Chinese power and make the world safe for
democracy.]{.underline}

Disparate actors are starting to join forces to roll back Beijing's
power. In the process, they are reordering the world.

This clash of systems will define the twenty-first century and divide
the world. [China will view the emerging democratic order as a
containment strategy designed to strangle its economy and topple its
regime.]{.underline} In response, it will seek to protect itself by
asserting greater military control over its vital sea-lanes, carving out
exclusive economic zones for its firms, and propping up autocratic
allies as it sows chaos in democracies. The [upsurge of Chinese
repression and aggression, in turn, will further impel the United States
and its allies to shun Beijing and build a democratic
order.]{.underline} For a tiny glimpse of what this vicious cycle might
look like, consider what happened in March 2021, when Canada, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials
for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The sanctions amounted to a slap on
the wrist, but Beijing interpreted them as an assault on its sovereignty
and unleashed a diplomatic tirade and a slew of economic sanctions. The
EU returned fire by freezing its proposed EU-China Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment.

In the coming years, [the trade and technology wars between China and
the United States that began during the Trump administration will rage
on as both sides try to expand their respective spheres. Other countries
will find it increasingly difficult to hedge their bets by maintaining
links to both blocs]{.underline}. Instead, [China and the United States
will push their partners to pick sides, compelling them to reroute their
supply chains]{.underline} and adopt wholesale the ecosystem of
technologies and standards of one side's order. The Internet will be
split in two. When people journey from one order to the other---if they
can even get a visa---they will enter a different digital realm. Their
phones won't work, nor will their favorite websites, their email
accounts, or their precious social media apps. [Political warfare
between the two systems will intensify, as each tries to undermine the
domestic legitimacy and international appeal of its competitor. East
Asian sea-lanes will grow clogged with warships, and rival forces will
experience frequent close encounters]{.underline}.

The clash of systems between China and the United States will define the
twenty-first century and divide the world.

[The standoff will end only when one side defeats or exhausts the
other.]{.underline} As of now, [the smart money is on the U.S. side,
which has far more wealth and military assets than China does and better
prospects for future growth]{.underline}. [By the early 2030s, Xi, an
obese smoker with a stressful job, will be in his 80s, if he is still
alive.]{.underline} China's demographic crisis will be kicking into high
gear, with the country projected to lose roughly 70 million working-age
adults and gain 130 million senior citizens between now and then.
[Hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas Chinese loans will be due,
and many of China's foreign partners won't be able to pay them
back.]{.underline} It is hard to see how a country facing so many
challenges could long sustain its own international order, especially in
the face of determined opposition from the world's wealthiest countries.

#### Chinese hegemony is temporary -- environmental costs [zero]{.underline} its economic and military growth by 2050 [even in the world of renewables]{.underline}

**McCoy 22** -- *Alfred McCoy is the J.R.W. Smail Professor of History
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison* (Alfred, 2-25-2022, \"Will the
Fight for Hegemony Survive Climate Change?,\" Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-china-usa-beijing/)//KH

Simultaneously, China was also becoming the world's largest auto
manufacturer as the number of vehicles on its roads soared to 340
million in 2019, exceeding America's 276 million. However, [all of this
impressive news is depressing news as well.]{.underline} After all, [by
clinging to coal production on a major scale, while reaching for a
bigger slice of the world's oil imports for its transportation triad,
China's greenhouse-gas emissions doubled from just 14 percent of the
world's total in 2000 to 30 percent in 2019]{.underline}, far surpassing
that of the United States, previously the planet's leading emitter. With
only 150 vehicles per thousand people, compared to 850 in America, its
[auto industry still has ample growth potential---good news for its
economy, but terrible news for the global climate]{.underline} ([even if
China remains in the forefront of the development and use of electric
cars).]{.underline}

To power such headlong development, [China has, in fact, raised its
domestic coal production more than a thousand-fold]{.underline}, from
just 32 million metric tons in 1949 to a mind-boggling record of 4.1
billion tons by 2021. [**Even if you take into account** those massive
**natural-gas pipelines**]{.underline} it is building, its [enormous
**hydropower dams,** and its **world leadership in wind power**, as of
2020 China **still depended on coal** for a startling 57 percent of its
total energy use,]{.underline} even as its share of total global
coal-fired power climbed relentlessly to a record 53 percent. In other
words, [nothing]{.underline}, it seems, [can break that country's
leadership of its insatiable hunger for the dirtiest of all fossil
fuels.]{.underline}

On the global stage[, Beijing has been similarly obsessed with economic
growth above all else. Despite its promises to curb greenhouse-gas
emissions]{.underline} at recent UN climate conferences, [China is still
promoting coal-fired power at home and abroad. In 2020, the Institute of
International Finance reported that **85 percent** of all projects under
Beijing's BRI entailed high greenhouse-gas emissions,]{.underline}
particularly the 63 coal-fired electrical plants the project was
financing worldwide.

When the 2019 UN climate conference opened, C[hina itself was actively
constructing new coal-fueled electrical plants with a combined capacity
of 121 gigawatts---substantially more than the 105 gigawatts being built
by the rest of the world combined.]{.underline} By 2019, [China was the
largest single source of pollution on the planet, accounting for nearly
one-third of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary General António Guterres was warning that such
emissions were "putting billions of people at immediate risk." With an
impassioned urgency, he demanded "a death knell for coal and fossil
fuels before they destroy our planet" by banning all new coal-fired
power plants and phasing them out of developed nations by 2030.

Together, the planet's two great imperial powers, China and the United
States, accounted for 44 percent of total CO2 emissions in 2019 and so
far both have made painfully slow progress toward renewable energy. In a
joint declaration at the November 2021 Glasgow climate conference, the
United States agreed "to reach 100% carbon-pollution-free electricity by
2035," while China promised to "phase down" (but note, not "phase out")
coal starting with its "15th Five-Year Plan."

The US commitment soon died a quiet death in Congress, where President
Biden's own party killed his green-energy initiative. Amid all the
applause at Glasgow, nobody paid much attention to the fact that China's
next five-year plan doesn't even start until 2026, just as President Xi
Jinping's promise of carbon neutrality by 2060 is a perfect formula for
not averting the climate disaster that awaits us all.

[In its hell-bent drive for development, in other words, China is
digging its own grave (and ours as well).]{.underline}

[CLIMATE CATASTROPHE CIRCA 2050]{.underline}

[Even if China were to become the preeminent world power around
2030,]{.underline} [the accelerating pace of climate change will likely
curtail its hegemony within decades.]{.underline} As global warming
batters the country by mid-century, [Beijing will be forced to retreat
from its projection of global power to address urgent domestic
concerns.]{.underline}

In 2017, scientists at the nonprofit group Climate Central calculated,
for instance, that [rising seas and storm surges could, by 2060 or 2070,
flood areas inhabited by 275 million people worldwide,]{.underline} with
Shanghai deemed "the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious
flooding." In that sprawling metropolis, 17.5 million people are likely
to be displaced as most of the city "could eventually be submerged in
water, including much of the downtown area."

Advancing the date of this disaster by at least a decade, a 2019 report
on rising sea levels in Nature Communications found that [150 million
people worldwide are now living on land that will be submerged by
2050]{.underline} and Shanghai was, once again, found to be facing
serious risk. There, [rising waters "threaten to consume the heart" of
the metropolis and its surrounding cities, crippling one of China's main
economic engines.]{.underline} Dredged from sea and swamp since the
fifteenth century, much of that city is likely to return to the waters
from whence it came in the next three decades.

Simultaneously, [soaring temperatures are expected to devastate the
North China Plain between Beijing and Shanghai, one of that country's
prime agricultural regions currently inhabited by 400 million
people]{.underline}, nearly a third of that country's population. [It
could, in fact, potentially become one of the most lethal places on the
planet.]{.underline}

"This spot is going to be the hottest spot for deadly heat waves in the
future," said Elfatih Eltahir, a climate specialist at MIT who published
his findings in the journal Nature Communications. [Between 2070 and
2100, he estimates, the region could face hundreds of periods of
"extreme danger" and perhaps five lethal periods of 35° Wet Bulb
Temperature (where a combination of heat and high humidity prevents the
evaporation of the sweat that cools the human body). After just six
hours under such conditions, a healthy person at rest will
die.]{.underline}

Rather than sudden and catastrophic, [the impact of climate change in
North China is likely to be incremental and cumulative, escalating
relentlessly with each passing decade. If the "Chinese century" does
indeed start around 2030, it's unlikely to last long once its main
financial center at Shanghai is flooded out and its agricultural
heartland is baking in insufferable heat.]{.underline}

#### China is irredeemably hostile -- multipolarity fails even if it's the most beneficial action

**Zelikow 22** - *Professor of History at the University of Virginia. A
former U.S. diplomat and Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, he
has worked for five presidential administrations* (Philip, July/August

IN IT TOGETHER

It may be easy, and perhaps natural, for the would-be architects of the
new system to organize it around Washington. But that would be a
mistake. The enemies of this new order, united by their resentment of
the United States, will seek to discredit it as just another effort to
dominate global affairs. For this new order to be viable, it must be
conceived in such a way that the charge is false.

The new order must also be decentralized to be effective; the resources
and wisdom needed to solve many vexing problems are not concentrated in
the United States. For instance, on the enormous issue of defining rules
for a digitized world, Washington has been confused and passive,
despite---or perhaps because of---its dominance in such commerce. It is
the European Union that has led the way. The EU's General Data
Protection Regulation, its Digital Services Act, and its Digital Markets
Act created the standards that influence most of the world, including
the Americas. Decentralized leadership has also proved critical to
responding to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The nucleus of the
emerging pro-Ukraine coalition, for instance, is not just the United
States but the entire G-7, including the European Commission. South
Korea and Australia should be invited to join this coalition as well.

Yet a revised system of world order shouldn't be limited to the United
States and its traditional allies. It must be open to any countries that
can and will help attain its common objectives. India should have a
place at any symbolic high table, for example, as a permanent member of
the UN Security Council. But India's leaders are still making their
choices about their will and capacity to work on common problems. Even
China should be welcome at the table. [After much internal debate in the
early 1990s, China's leaders chose to play a major and often
constructive role in the global commonwealth system that emerged after
the end of the Cold War.]{.underline} In 2005, Zoellick famously urged
Beijing to become a "responsible stakeholder." As late as 2017, Kurt
Campbell, who now leads Asia policy for the Biden White House, thought
this invitation was a wise move.

But [Zoellick's words were a challenge, one that Beijing is failing to
meet. China's partnership with Putin---whom Xi described to the Russian
press as "my best and bosom friend"---is the opposite of
responsible.]{.underline} Instead, it [shows that China and Russia lead
a primarily Eurasian grouping of dangerous states, including the likes
of Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan]{.underline}. Their loose
confederation has its cross-purposes and [is united mainly by hostility
toward the United States]{.underline}. But it is building tighter links,
better divisions of labor, and more effective coordination than existed
among the Axis powers before or during World War II.

For these and other reasons, p[essimists believe China is irredeemably
hostile. They argue that China has written off the United States as a
country determined to resist China's rise and that Chinese leaders may
feel they have little to lose by embracing confrontation.]{.underline}
In this pessimistic view, [China is trying to shift from the post--Cold
War era's emphasis on global interdependence toward a Chinese grand
strategy of Eurasian dominance and growing national
self-sufficiency]{.underline}. [China's leaders are now using the
pandemic to keep a chokehold on international travel and strengthen
domestic surveillance]{.underline}.

[That does seem to be China's current plan. But it is unclear whether
this plan will work. It rests on unproven social, political, and
economic premises that are starting to deeply disturb parts of Chinese
society essential to its past and future success---]{.underline}such as
the many residents of Shanghai who have been trapped during the city's
draconian recent lockdown.

[The resources and wisdom needed to solve many global problems are not
concentrated in the United States.]{.underline}

Chinese leaders may also have noticed that, in backing the Putin regime,
they have tethered themselves to an adventurist Russian government that,
for 30 years, has treated its neighbors much as Japan treated China
between 1915 and 1945. For instance, Putin insists that Russia is not
invading Ukraine. There is no war, he declared; there is only a "special
military operation." Many Chinese people will recall that, from 1937 to
1941, Japan insisted that it, too, was not invading China. There was no
war, the Japanese said; there was merely a "China incident."

Throughout the years of Japanese aggression, the United States defended
China's territorial integrity. Even amid times of misjudgment and
weakness, Washington maintained that stance, refusing in November 1941
to make a deal with Japan at China's expense. Ten days later, Japan went
to war against the United States. As they watch what is happening in
2022, Chinese leaders can still reflect on this past and consider what
decisions to make.

If Beijing charts a new course, it would not be the first time it has
chosen to change. But if China does rejoin a system of world order, it
should be a new one. The old system has fractured and must be remade.
Facing tragic realities, the citizens of the free world must rebuild a
global order that is practical enough to address the most vital common
problems, even if it cannot and does not promise progress on all the
values and concerns people face. This system will be far more effective
if the world's most populous country joins it, and China faces another
time of choosing. Regardless of China's participation, responsible
actors must begin the hard, substantive work of protecting the planet
from war, climate, economic, and health risks. The time for rhetoric and
posturing is over.

A DEMOCRATIC WORLD ORDER

[After 2050, the international community will face]{.underline} a
growing contradiction, even [a head-on collision, between the two
foundational principles of the current world order: national sovereignty
and human rights]{.underline}. As long as nations have the sovereign
right to seal their borders, [the world will have no way of protecting
the human rights of the 200 million to 1.2 billion climate-change
refugees expected to be created by 2050,]{.underline} both within their
own borders and beyond. Faced with such extreme disorder, it is just
possible that the [nations of this planet might agree to cede some small
portion of their sovereignty to a global government set up to cope with
the climate crisis.]{.underline}

To meet the extraordinary mid-century challenges to come, [a
supranational body like the UN would need sovereign authority over at
least three significant priorities]{.underline}---[emission controls,
refugee resettlement, and environmental reconstruction.]{.underline}
First, a [reformed UN would need the power to compel nations to end
their emissions if the transition to renewable energy is still not
complete by, at the latest, 2050.]{.underline} Second, [an empowered UN
high commissioner for refugees would have to be authorized to supersede
national sovereignty by requiring temperate northern countries to deal
with the tidal flows of humanity from the tropical and subtropical
regions most impacted]{.underline} and made least inhabitable by climate
change. Finally, [the voluntary transfer of funds like the \$100 billion
promised poor nations at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference would have to
become mandatory to keep afflicted communities,]{.underline} and
especially the world's poor, [relatively safe.]{.underline}

In the crisis to come, such [initiatives would]{.underline} by their
very nature [change the idea of what constitutes a world
order]{.underline} from the amorphous imperial ethos of the past five
centuries [to a new form of global governance.]{.underline} To exercise
effective sovereignty over the global commons, the UN would have to
enact some long overdue reforms, notably by creating an elective
Security Council without either permanent members or the present
great-power prerogative of unilaterally vetoing measures. Instead of
superpower strength serving as the ultimate guarantor for UN decisions,
[a democratized Security Council could reach climate decisions by
majority vote and enforce them through the moral authority, as well as
the self-interest, of a more representative international
body.]{.underline}

[If a UN of this sort were indeed in existence by at least 2050, such a
framework of democratic world governance could well be complemented by a
globally decentralized system of energy]{.underline}. For five centuries
now, energy and imperial hegemony have been deeply intertwined. In the
transition to alternative energy, however, households will, sooner or
later, be able to control their own solar power everywhere the sun
shines, while communities will be able to supplement that variable
source with a mix of wind turbines, biomass, hydro, and mini-reactors.

Just as the demands of petroleum production shaped the steep hierarchy
of Washington's world order, so [decentralized access to energy could
foster a more inclusive global governance. After five centuries of
Iberian, British, American, and Chinese hegemony, it's at least possible
that humanity]{.underline}, even under the increasingly stressful
conditions of climate change, [could finally experience a more
democratic world order.]{.underline}

### Sustainability

#### Japan and Germany indicate a US hegemonic decline in Europe and East Asia

**Leonard 22** -- *Director of the European Council on Foreign
Relations* (Mark, 6-13-2022, \"The Real End of Pax Americana,\" Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2022-06-13/real-end-pax-americana)//KH

"NORMAL POWERS"?

Over the years, [Germany and Japan have had several national debates
about becoming "normal powers" and have gradually moved in that
direction]{.underline}. Both countries are [now more active militarily
than they have been in decades, but they still punch way under their
economic weight. The **war in Ukraine could change that**]{.underline},
however.

For the first time in the postwar era, [both Germany and Japan face
unavoidable threats.]{.underline} After Germany was reunified in 1990,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was fond of saying that the country was
"surrounded only by friends and partners." Now, there seems to be
societal consensus in Germany that this has changed: even before Moscow
launched its invasion, [more than half of German respondents to a
January 2022 poll claimed that Russia's stance on Ukraine posed a large
military threat to their country]{.underline}. And many [Japanese fear
that a war over Taiwan could be next.]{.underline} Polls shows that a
large majority of the Japanese public is concerned that Russia's war in
Ukraine will impact how China deals with its territorial disputes. And
as Narushige Michishita, vice president of the National Graduate
Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, told me, "[If there is a war in
the Taiwan Strait, Japan would almost automatically be involved as Japan
accommodates U.S. bases]{.underline} and China would attack them."

Also auguring for a more muscular security stance is generational
change: [German and Japanese guilt is dying out along with the last
surviving perpetrators and victims of World War II.]{.underline} As the
historian Andreas Wirsching has argued, the [war in Ukraine is
accelerating Germany's break with its Nazi past]{.underline} (in ways he
finds troubling[). Having taken a stand against Moscow, Berlin is
finally "on the right side of history]{.underline}." And with Russian
President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, there is another villain on the
European continent accused of genocide and pursuing a war of
extermination. Meanwhile, [in Japan, fear of China's rising power is
eclipsing the memory of the country's past crimes, both among the
Japanese public and in many Asian capitals.]{.underline}

Finally, [Germany and Japan may no longer feel they can rely on the
United States for their security. According to one recent poll, 56
percent of German respondents believe that in ten years, China will be a
stronger power than the United States. Fifty-three percent said that
Americans cannot be trusted after electing Donald Trump]{.underline}
president in 2016, and [60 percent said Germany cannot always count on
the United States to defend it and so must invest in European
defense.]{.underline} These fears are shared among even the most
Atlanticist segments of the elite. As Wolfgang Ischinger, a former
German ambassador to the United States, told me, "Germans are fortunate
to have Biden in the White House, but [Germany needs to have a plan B in
case there are big changes to American politics."]{.underline} He
[believes Germany should explore the possibility of a nuclear guarantee
from France]{.underline}, something that would have been unthinkable
even a few months ago.

Doubts about American power and reliability are less openly articulated
in Japan. According to an April poll, however, [nearly two-thirds of
Japanese support strengthening Japan's defense capabilities, and a
majority agree with the LDP proposal of spending two percent of GDP on
defense]{.underline}. Ken Jimbo, a security specialist at Keio
University, explained that after the tumult of the Trump years, many
Japanese strategists think the country needs to invest more in its own
defense and "diversify beyond the United States." [They watched with
concern as Washington declined to intervene directly in Ukraine after
highlighting the difference between a NATO and a non-NATO ally and
warning of the dangers of confronting a nuclear Russia]{.underline}.
"[The question," according to Jimbo, "is how much we can trust the
United States to defend Taiwan in the face of Chinese nuclear
threats."]{.underline}

#### "Hegemony sustainable" scholars [underestimate]{.underline} domestic influence on international standing -- US divisions mean [zero chance]{.underline} the plan revitalizes heg

the School of International Service at American University* (Amitav,

In the year and a half since U.S. President Joe Biden came to office,
the international order has often seemed defined by a resurgence of
great-power conflict. China and the United States remain locked in a
robust rivalry. In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Washington
and its NATO allies have been drawn into a large-scale war in Europe
that pits the liberal West against an autocratic Russia. In this
volatile world, many analysts suggest, the most important kinds of power
are once again military and economic: the continued ability of the
United States to limit the threat of authoritarian rivals depends on the
extent to which it can maintain the most advanced armed forces in the
world and ensure that its economic might can outpace China's.

[Often overlooked in the commentary]{.underline}, however, are [the ways
in which military and economic power are dependent on social stability
at home. Biden's populist predecessor, Donald Trump, exploited growing
divisions over class, race, gender, and religion for political
purposes]{.underline}. He also [shunned multilateral alliances, pulled
out of international agreements, and cultivated cozy relations with
autocrat]{.underline}s such as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
and Russian President Vladimir Putin, all in the name of rejecting the
values of liberal elites and the existing Western establishment [in
favor of a more nationalist, "America first" vision. One result is that
many U.S. allies today have much less confidence in the ability of
Washington to uphold the liberal international order]{.underline}.
Although they have welcomed renewed U.S. engagement in NATO and Europe,
many [European governments wonder how long the approach will last if
another populist president is elected in 2024.]{.underline}

The United States is not alone in facing deep social polarization. In
many countries---in both the West and other parts of the
world---political and social cleavages over class, race, gender, and
religion have become increasingly pronounced. Rising income inequality
has slowed growth and social mobility since the Great Recession of 2008,
not only in countries such as Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United
States but also in Finland, Norway, and Sweden---countries known for
their more equitable wealth distributions. Anti-Asian hate crimes have
risen sharply in the United States and globally since the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, China and India have also
experienced rising income inequality, and they now rank at the bottom of
the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index on women's health and
survival. And religious freedom is diminishing in both of these
countries, as well as in Hungary, Indonesia, and Russia.

These tensions underscore a key point: [as Western governments focus on
international conflicts, strategic competition, and disruptions to the
global economy, an even greater threat to world stability may come from
internal social divisions that sap countries' unity and
strength.]{.underline} These [forces are all part of what might be
called "power within"---the domestic social hierarchies that determine
who gets to have power and why.]{.underline} And just as these
hierarchies can affect national prosperity and social stability, they
can also enhance or constrain a country's influence in the world. For
any given country, [the internal distribution of power may be as
important to international relations as external geopolitical and
ideological forces, since social hierarchies are often more deep-rooted,
ubiquitous, insidious, and enduring]{.underline}. It is vital, then, to
address these cleavages if the United States and its allies are to
defend and revive the liberal international order.

POWER WITHIN

For decades, international relations experts have tended to downplay the
role of domestic power relationships in shaping the world order. This
has been true even with the growing recognition of soft power and other
indirect forms of international influence: the concept of international
power---whether exercised through coercion, persuasion, seduction, or
cooperation---continues to be understood as fundamentally a matter of
external relations between countries. Of course, political scientists
have long recognized that foreign policy goals and outcomes are
influenced by domestic politics. U.S. politicians often talk about
getting their own house in order as a prerequisite for maintaining U.S.
primacy in world affairs; Biden's version of this has been to call for
"a foreign policy for the middle class." But whether in the United
States or elsewhere, such rhetoric has rarely led to a systematic and
serious effort to understand how internal social hierarchies affect
international power

The neglect has two main causes[. First, scholars and policymakers have
tended to frame the concept of power around national
security]{.underline}. National security has traditionally been defined
as protecting a country's sovereignty and territorial integrity against
foreign military threats, an approach that tends to ignore nonmilitary
and noneconomic sources of power. [Second, the idea of world order is
often conflated with the distribution of military and economic
capabilities among countries, without taking account of the variations
in social hierarchies within them.]{.underline}

Racial disparities at home limit political and economic power abroad.

But as recent history has shown, [analysts ignore these internal forces
at their peril. There is now a significant body of data on the effects
of social cleavages---whether]{.underline} based on class, race, gender,
or religion---[on political and economic power.]{.underline} Uneven
access to new technology and education, for example, along with economic
deregulation and cuts in welfare benefits, has led to a growing class
divide between those at the top of social hierarchies and those lower
down. According to the Pew Research Center, [the income gap between the
top ten percent and the bottom ten percent of earners in the United
States increased by 39 percent between 1980 and 2018]{.underline}. The
pattern is being repeated in middle-income and emerging-market
countries, such as China and India, with an estimated two-thirds of the
global population now experiencing growing income inequality. A Credit
Suisse report found that at the end of 2019, only one percent of the
world's adult population controlled over 43 percent of global personal
wealth, whereas 54 percent of adults accounted for just two percent.

[Race has become another source of social and political
division]{.underline}. Although racial disparities have never been far
from the surface in the United States and other Western democracies,
they have received much greater scrutiny in recent years. The Black
Lives Matter movement has generated worldwide attention, driving
activist campaigns to remove the statues of slaveholders and colonial
rulers from public places, to seek reparations for the descendants of
enslaved people, and to remove the names of avowed racists from
venerable institutions. But these [demands have also provoked a growing
backlash from the nativistic right in]{.underline} both [the United
States]{.underline} and Europe, where racist violence has grown and
racist ideas have increasingly come into the mainstream. In the United
States, laws designed to protect the economic opportunities and voting
rights of minorities have been rolled back.

Although distinct from those of race, hierarchies of caste---social
groupings based on work or descent---continue to shape political and
economic power in many parts of the world. The Asia Dalit Rights
Forum---an organization devoted to defending the rights of members of
low castes---has estimated that some 260 million people worldwide, the
majority of them in India and Nepal, suffer discrimination on the basis
of caste identity. Under India's Hindu nationalist government,
discrimination and abuse based on caste have grown in recent years,
including a rise in violence against low-caste women.

[Gender disparities and religious persecution also continue to be widely
prevalent. Despite progress in recent decades, the World Bank has
estimated that some 2.4 billion working-age women worldwide still lack
full economic rights.]{.underline} In 95 countries, women have no
guarantee of equal pay, and 76 countries restrict women's property
rights. In the case of religion, repressive practices have not only
persisted but appear to be growing. The Pew Research Center has found
that between 2007 and 2017, the number of governments imposing "high" or
"very high" levels of restrictions on religion increased from 40 to 52,
and the number of countries experiencing high levels of "social
hostilities involving religion" jumped from 39 to 56. Notably, in a
number of major states, leaders increasingly invoke their country's
civilizational past in ways that encourage discrimination against
minority groups and faiths. Consider India, where attacks on
Muslim-owned businesses and Christian schools have dramatically
increased, or Turkey, which has witnessed a steady erosion of secular
values and a growing repression of religious minorities, or China, which
has confined hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim
minorities in "reeducation camps."

[These social fault lines can have a direct impact on international
relations. A country that can effectively manage its social hierarchies
can often enhance its productivity, economic growth, and political
stability, thereby increasing its influence in the world order. A
country that cannot, however, may damage or undercut its international
standing by eroding other countries' confidence in its stability or its
commitment to international norms of social and human
rights]{.underline}. Moreover, an unequal or socially restrictive
internal distribution of power may also affect a country's long-term
political and economic influence. It is particularly concerning, then,
that [domestic social disparities remain alarmingly high and in some
cases appear to be increasing in many liberal democracies, including the
United States.]{.underline}

DIMINISHING RETURNS

The distribution of power within countries matters to the international
order above all because of its far-reaching economic impact. A 2014
study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for
example, found that in the years leading up to the 2008 global financial
crisis, rising income inequality lowered economic growth in Italy, the
United Kingdom, and the United States by between six and nine percentage
points; for Mexico and New Zealand, the loss was an even larger ten
percent. The same study also found that France, Ireland, and
Spain---countries in which income inequality was kept in
check---benefited from higher GDP growth.

Many countries are also held back by racial disparities. Although the
institution of slavery once propelled the United States and the West to
global dominance---by cheapening the cost of labor and boosting overall
exports---there is growing evidence that the long-term legacy of this
unjust system has been lower economic growth, higher social instability,
and persistent racial hierarchies. The consulting firm McKinsey &
Company has estimated that between 2019 and 2028, the wealth gap between
Black and white Americans will cost the U.S. economy \$1 trillion to
\$1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment. In India, caste plays
a similar role. Although caste can increase economic activity and
efficiency in the short run---through networking and mutual support
within castes---the rigid social hierarchies it creates restrict capital
and labor mobility. As researchers have pointed out, persistent caste
structures have likely reduced India's growth by undermining efforts to
alleviate poverty and achieve greater income equality and by slowing the
country's transition to a full-fledged industrial economy.

Similarly large is the impact of gender discrimination on national
productivity. By restricting or limiting women's access to education,
business, politics, and other areas of economic activity, gender
discrimination also limits the labor supply. In developing countries,
this is especially true in the agricultural sector, where women play a
critical role. Constraints on women's participation in the workforce
make it harder for low-income countries to move out of poverty. But
gender barriers can affect advanced countries, as well. In 2016, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that
gender discrimination costs the global economy as much as \$12 trillion
per year, or about 16 percent of global GDP.

Religious restrictions also make the business environment in many
countries less attractive. In Egypt, for example, where tourists provide
a major source of economic activity, the tourism sector has been
negatively affected by religious conflicts, including violence between
Christians and Muslims and between the Muslim Brotherhood and the regime
of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Extensive religious
restrictions in many Arab countries---such as subjecting financial
instruments to the arbitrary and inconsistent regulations of Islamic law
boards---have prompted young entrepreneurs to take their talents
overseas. Sometimes, countries' repressive religious practices can also
interfere with major international business deals. In 1999, Goldman
Sachs had to restructure its initial public offering agreement with the
China National Petroleum Corporation, which had investments in Sudan,
after the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended
sanctions on Sudan for violations of religious freedom. (In the
restructured deal, Goldman created a new company with CNPC that would
operate only in China.) In all these ways, then, internal social
divisions can have a direct impact on a country's economic performance
and, hence, on one of the core forms of international power.

FROM CLEAVAGES TO CONFLICT

But the effects of social cleavages can go well beyond economic growth.
When social divisions are allowed to fester, they may threaten a
country's underlying social and political stability. Recent conflicts in
Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Yemen, among other places, have been
driven by internal religious divisions. In 2021, the scholars Weiling
Jiang and Igor Martek found that religious tensions ranked among the top
four "significant political risk factors" affecting foreign investment
in the energy sector in 74 developing countries. In countries with acute
income inequality, citizens may also be more prone to rise up against
the government to achieve economic, social, and political parity.
Governments that promote or sustain racial and religious discrimination
may also encourage higher rates of violence or extremism. Notably,
during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, on average, a low-caste Indian
person was victimized by a crime every ten minutes.

Gender-based violence has been particularly persistent in many
countries. According to the World Health Organization, in 2021, 27
percent of women worldwide in the 15--49 age group who were in a
relationship experienced some form of abuse, either physical or sexual
violence or both, by an intimate partner. In the developing world, women
suffer from specific forms of violence because of traditional social
practices such as requiring dowries, honor killing, and genital
mutilation. But violence against women is not restricted to poor
countries. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, for example, has included
Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom among the countries that have
the highest reported rates of sexual violence. The United States has a
notably high rate of rape.

Social tensions at home are likely to play out internationally. States
experiencing violence or social instability may be limited in their
ability to project soft power; they may also be prone to creating
bilateral tensions and undermining free-trade negotiations and other
forms of multilateral cooperation. Caste tensions are a perennial cause
of political violence in India, which has undercut the country's global
reputation.

MORE TOLERANCE, MORE POWER

Although divisions over class, race, gender, and religion are increasing
in many parts of the world, evidence suggests that when such tensions
are reduced, countries can enhance their international power. For
example, providing women with stronger legal rights and better access to
health care, education, financial services, and technology is good not
just for human rights or social justice but also for increasing
productivity. According to Oxfam, rising numbers of women in the paid
workforce in Latin America contributed to a 30 percent reduction in
poverty between 2000 and 2010. In 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute
estimated that the benefits to the world economy offered by the full
inclusion of women in the paid workforce would equal \$28 trillion by
2025.

Reducing social cleavages in the workforce could add \$7.2 trillion a
year to U.S. GDP.

Countries can make similar gains by eliminating racial disparities. A
study by the think tank PolicyLink and the University of Southern
California found that removing the pay gap between racial groups would
increase U.S. economic growth by 14 percent; the Washington Center for
Equitable Growth has estimated that reducing racial, ethnic, and gender
gaps could add \$7.2 trillion a year to U.S. GDP. Such benefits would
need to be weighed against the costs of government spending to equalize
pay, but the rewards would still be substantial.

Enhancing religious tolerance and freedom can also affect national
economic competitiveness. Notably, none of the ten countries that the
Pew Research Center has ranked as having "very high" restrictions on
religion---a group that includes Algeria, China, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia,
the Maldives, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan---is among the
top 20 most competitive countries in the World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Index.

A WARNING TO THE WEST

Recognizing that power within can affect the external strength of
countries offers important lessons for international relations. [For the
West, the growth of social cleavages should come as a warning. As a
growing body of research shows, democracy does not inevitably lead to a
reduction of hierarchies based on income, race, gender, or
religion]{.underline}. Western democracies as a group have not performed
particularly well in any of these areas. To the contrary, [democratic
institutions can provide cover for social divisions and allow them to be
exploited for political gain, as has occurred in the United
States]{.underline} and elsewhere in recent years. As these disparities
become more pronounced, moreover, [they also weaken the ability of the
West to counter the spread of autocracy.]{.underline} For example,
scholars have noted that rising income inequality has contributed to the
eroding appeal of the liberal international order.

These trends are not irreversible. In contrast to their nondemocratic
counterparts, advanced democracies have the capacity to self-correct and
challenge persistent social hierarchies. Because of their greater
transparency, freedom of expression, and culture of open debate,
democratic societies can expose these divisions, and their electorates
can change governments that are viewed as unwilling or unable to address
the root causes[. Yet in the United States]{.underline}, Europe, and
elsewhere[, democracies have been constrained by political polarization
and the rise of right-wing populism, which have made it increasingly
difficult to form a political consensus to tackle cleavages based on
class, race, gender, and religion.]{.underline} At the same time, many
advanced countries have established economic interests that may have a
stake in reinforcing existing practices.

Of course, internal power structures can also limit the influence of
many non-Western countries. Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South
Africa are particularly striking examples of countries with large
economies and significant socioeconomic disparities based on caste,
gender, and religious identity. According to the World Bank, South
Africa is the most unequal country in the world, with the wealthiest one
percent of the population holding 80.6 percent of the country's
financial assets. This is important not only because of the link between
income inequality and low growth but also because of the incentive it
creates for corruption and instability. In many countries, moreover,
different types of social hierarchies often appear in tandem and are
mutually reinforcing. Income inequality, for example, often correlates
with racial, caste, gender, and religious discrimination. Racial
prejudice is a trigger for religious intolerance and vice versa. Hence,
policymakers will need to develop strategies that go beyond specific
disparities to address the conditions that lead to all types of social
hierarchies.

Reducing social cleavages will not eliminate differences in power and
status among countries. But those that better develop and harness their
power within by ensuring fairer wage distribution and curbing
discriminatory practices---and therefore maximizing growth---are likely
to enjoy greater stability and influence in the long run. Such efforts
will need to begin at home, including in the United States and in many
of its European allies. [But given the prevalence of these divisions in
many countries, lasting progress is unlikely to be achieved through
domestic politics alone. Stepped-up global cooperation will be needed,
including collective efforts to strengthen international human rights
agreements and other international rules aimed at preventing
discrimination on the basis of race, caste, gender, and religious
belief.]{.underline} Since all countries, rich and poor, suffer from
these disparities, reform efforts can and should be framed as a common
challenge of humankind. By creating a more level playing field among
social groups, the United States and other members of the liberal
international order can better mobilize their power within and promote
their collective ability to enhance stability and peace in the world as
a whole.

#### The US' current hegemonic trajectory is unsustainable, meeting multiple markers fitting declining powers

**Mazarr 22** -- *Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation*.
(Michael J., July/August 2022, \"What Makes a Power Great,\" Foreign
Affairs,

A BALANCED RECIPE

Each of these seven characteristics is associated with national
competitiveness, but not even societies that boast all of them can be
assured of long-term success. [Nations that prevail in long-term
competitions must achieve balance in each trait, since all of these
advantages can spiral into excess and become liabilities. This is
perhaps most true of national ambition, which can lead nations to
overextend themselves.]{.underline} But it is also true of the other
characteristics. Efforts to build an active state can, for example,
produce a centralizing agenda that curdles into authoritarianism and
intolerance. Effective institutions can become bloated and stifling
bureaucracies. Too much pluralism can dissolve national unity. Most
[dynamic and successful nations have therefore sought all seven of the
essential characteristics in healthy moderation.]{.underline}

Nations gain tremendous competitive advantage from an active,
public-minded elite.

They have also enabled the characteristics to reinforce one another. The
most potent advantage of each trait arises not from its individual
consequences but from its combined effect with those of the others.
[National ambition and a culture of learning and adapting strongly
reinforce each other, as do an active state and effective institutions.
Shared opportunity must be combined with some diversity and pluralism to
gain its true value. This recipe for national success, with mutually
reinforcing ingredients, shows up in all the competitively dominant
societies,]{.underline} allowing for differences in era and approach. It
[mixes strong state-supported national ambition with varied and diverse
human capital, effective social institutions and rule of law, a spirit
of shared national community, and a deeply felt reverence for
experimentation and new ideas.]{.underline}

In order for this recipe to produce competitive success, a society must
have a public-spirited elite class. Nations gain tremendous competitive
advantage from an active, public-minded elite that is representative of
the broader society and connected to it via avenues of social mobility.
But when a nation's elite, or much of it, becomes corrupt or engages in
rent-seeking behavior, that nation's vibrancy, resilience, and
competitive edge will erode. Crucially, the quality of a nation's elite
plays a vital role in determining the legitimacy of its governing
institutions. [Where elites are seen as corrupt and self-interested
rather than devoted to the public good, societies and the institutions
that govern them often atrophy or break down.]{.underline}

OVER THE HILL?

[All this should give American leaders pause.]{.underline} In the second
half of the twentieth century, the United States mastered the recipe for
national competitiveness better than any nation in history. And even
now, aspects of American society continue to exhibit strong elements of
the seven essential characteristics: social mobility, diversity and
political pluralism, in particular. Despite their troubles, moreover,
U.S. government institutions from the local to the federal level still
rank high in global evaluations of transparency and effectiveness. But
there are also serious reasons for concern. [If the United States
continues on its current trajectory, it will risk weakening or even
losing many of the traits that for the last 75 years have made it the
world's dominant power]{.underline}.

[Four of the seven characteristics are especially at risk. One is
national will and ambition.]{.underline} [Survey evidence suggests that
younger Americans do not view the United States, its values, or its
ambitions in the same way as older Americans]{.underline}. A 2019
Eurasia Group Foundation survey, for example, found that fully [55
percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 do not think the
United States is "exceptional," compared with only 25 percent of
Americans over 60.]{.underline} Belief in American exceptionalism is not
the same as ambition, of course, but it does [indicate confidence in the
national mission]{.underline}. Taken [together with the many surveys
that show growing popular skepticism about the need to project U.S.
military power overseas, Americans' waning confidence in their national
mission suggests a country that is less self-assured than it once
was.]{.underline} Across a wide range of issues, polls reveal that
[Americans generally have less faith in the future and in their major
political and social institutions than they have in half a
century.]{.underline} Such survey results have always ebbed and flowed,
and Americans have had little faith in some institutions, such as
Congress, for many decades now. But on the whole, public opinion polls
paint a picture of a nation that is no longer sure of itself, much less
of its right and duty to impose its will on the world.

The [United States' shared national identity may be in even greater
peril]{.underline}. Increasingly, polling data and other observable
trends---such as "associative sorting," wherein people move to live
closer to others with similar views---suggest that [the country is
becoming divided into mutually suspicious camps with little common
ground]{.underline}. This [national fragmentation has been accelerated
by a siloed information environment]{.underline} that allows
disinformation and conspiracy theories to thrive.

[Shared opportunity also shows signs of waning. Inequality is rising,
and intergenerational mobility appears to be stalled.]{.underline} As
the economist Raj Chetty and his collaborators at Harvard's Opportunity
Insights project have shown, [only half of young people today earn more
than their parents did, compared with 90 percent of people born in
1940.]{.underline} Efforts to close opportunity gaps in areas such as
access to venture capital have not been sufficient to reverse these
troubling trends. [At best, the level of shared opportunity has
plateaued, and it may well be retreating after decades of
progress]{.underline}.

Finally, [the spirit of learning and adaptation in the United States is
increasingly threatened by the corrosive information environment.
Competitive societies are information-processing organisms whose various
components take insights about the world and turn them into
behavior]{.underline}. Yet the U[.S. information marketplace is being
corrupted, in part because of the tremendous amounts of misinformation
sloshing through social media, the sensationalism of the news media, the
fragmentation of information sources, and the emergence of a "trolling"
ethic that]{.underline} encourages hostility and mean-spiritedness in
public discourse.

The United States continues to exhibit clear societal strengths. But
data on issues as varied as the explosive rise of bureaucratic and
administrative functions across many U.S. public and private
institutions and the growing proportion of investment devoted to
so-called value extraction, including via stock buybacks, suggest that
the country may be living off the accumulated benefits of long-standing
advantages rather than generating new competitive strengths. The [United
States displays some of the characteristics of a once dominant power
that has passed its competitive prime: by some important measures, it is
complacent, highly bureaucratized, and seeking short-term gains and
rents rather than long-term productive breakthroughs]{.underline}. It is
socially and politically divided, [cognizant of the need for reforms yet
unwilling or unable to make them, and suffering a loss of faith in the
shared national project that once animated it.]{.underline}

Today, the United States finds itself deficient in many of the qualities
that powered its rise.

At the [same time that the United States has allowed some of its
societal strengths to atrophy, its closest rival---China---has built up
tremendous societal strengths in some areas but also allowed potentially
fatal weaknesses to fester in others]{.underline}. China clearly
[benefits from a potent national will and ambition, both domestically
and internationally, and a unified national identity]{.underline} among
much of the population. It has [an active state that is pouring
resources into human capital, research and development, high technology,
and infrastructure]{.underline}. Its subnational governments
theoretically offer platforms for vibrant, pluralistic experiments in
social policy. China has a [proud tradition of learning and education,
and its governing institutions appear to have a high degree of
legitimacy:]{.underline} in the 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer, an online
survey of public opinion in 28 countries, China scored toward the top of
the rankings for average levels of trust in nongovernmental
organizations, business, government, and media. In some ways, therefore,
Chi[na seems to be cultivating a powerful combination of essential
characteristics for competitive success and positioning itself to leap
ahead of the United States.]{.underline}

#### Insufficient institutional COVID response destroyed the US-led LIO

The coronavirus crisis as a challenge to the liberal global order

Very [early in the pandemic, the crisis was seen as a problem for the
liberal economic order (]{.underline}Norrlöf, 2020a). [Next to the
challenges of democratic and liberal capitalism on the domestic
level]{.underline} (see Chapters 30 and 31), [it also affected some of
the core pillars of the LIO in the international economic realm; for
example, the freedom of individual movement]{.underline} (see Chapter
6), [the transnational openness for the movement of goods]{.underline}
(see Chapters 17 and 20) [and the transnational openness of financial
markets]{.underline} (see Chapter 18). Importantly, these are
[challenges to the specific LIO, not to intergovernmental
cooperation]{.underline} or international organizations per se; the
latter often were even able to expand their scope and policy instruments
during the crisis (Debre and Dijkstra, 2020), although they were unable
to ensure comprehensive international cooperation on core issues such as
the prevention of 'vaccine nationalism' (Abbas, 2020).

Similarly, the [core Western institutions of the liberal global order --
in particular, the G7 and the OECD -- did not play a leading role during
the crisis]{.underline}. In general, [the latter was fought individually
on the domestic level, with very little multilateral
coordination]{.underline} (Levy, 2021: 562-- 3). [Obligations to
international institutions]{.underline}, from the WTO to the Paris
Agreement on climate change targets[, took a back seat]{.underline}. As
far as multilateral [economic coordination took place, it involved the
G20, an international institution much less dominated by the West and
quite neutral to the core normative principles of the LIO]{.underline}.
Opportunities for the [creation of powerful international institutions
were also limited by the rise of nationalism triggered by the pandemic.
The latter had a 'rally- around- the- flag' effect, which also has led
to a more confrontational climate in foreign policy between China and
Western countries]{.underline}, as for example witnessed in the case of
Australia's China policy (Pan and Korolev, 2021: 127-- 33). [China-
based observers applaud the weakening of the LIO during the pandemic --
inter alia, due to the entrenchment of authoritarianism, the increasing
nationalism and the return of big power rivalry]{.underline} -- and
[assume that it provides China with many options to increase its options
globally. They also argue that China has weathered the storm of the
pandemic better than the US]{.underline} (Dunford and Qi, 2020; Huang,
2021).

#### Their ev assumes current pandemic conditions, but long-term trends prove China's rise will outpace the US

(Frankfurt) and Senior Researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Financial
Research SAFE*. (Andreas Nolke, May 10, 2022, Post-Corona Capitalism,

Is China prepared for global leadership? A core requirement for this
leadership role would be political and economic stability. These two
aspects are interrelated, as political stability in an authoritarian
regime such as China depends primarily on the ability to guarantee a
constantly improving standard of living. In comparative political
economy research on the Chinese economy, we can identify two
perspectives on the likeliness of this stability. On the one hand, there
are mainly [Western observers with a background in liberal
economics]{.underline} (for example, Economy, 2007). [These observers of
China predict that China will be not be able to continue its economic
rise, due to the lack of sustainability of its state- centred economy --
but they have been articulating this negative prediction for many years
already, to no avail.]{.underline} The alternative perspective, [more
often articulated by political economists and non- Western observers, is
that China's economic rise will continue, since it is based on a
coherent non- liberal model of capitalism]{.underline} (Nölke et al,
2020). What does the evidence of the coronavirus crisis tell us with
regard to these two competing perspectives? Several issues are at stake.
China may suffer from a decoupling of global production networks (see
Chapter 17). It also encounters backlashes with regard to the
acquisition of foreign companies and technologies (see Chapter 18). [The
Chinese economy, however, has weathered the pandemic well so far. Based
on draconian health measures and substantial fiscal as well as monetary
policy interventions, China recovered quickly]{.underline} (Tian, 2020),
particularly [in international comparison.]{.underline}

With regard to its international leadership role, China has suffered
some setbacks, such as a bad image as country of origin of the virus.
However, [China has tried to overcome these setbacks by its concerted
diplomatic efforts in terms of health assistance, including emergency
supplies to EU member states]{.underline}: 'China's public diplomacy has
gone into overdrive' (Seaman, 2020: 8). [In contrast to the EU and the
US, China has used its health diplomacy successfully as a soft- power
weapon]{.underline} in order to further its geo- economic influence
(Gauttam et al, 2020). Moreover, China has used the crisis to promote
its pre- existing 'techno- authoritarian project' that fuses
technological surveillance, a strong focus on public security and public
health, although it is yet unclear whether this approach will diffuse
globally (Greitens, 2020).

To sum up, [it is possible that the rise of China may temporarily slow
down due to the pandemic, but there are no indications that it will not
continue in the long run. This tendency is also supported by the erosion
of the US leadership role with regard to the global institutions of
liberal capitalism. While the US is still in a more powerful position
than China, due to its control of important economic networks and over
the global reserve currency]{.underline} (Drezner, 2020: E28), [the slow
erosion of its dominant role will continue.]{.underline}

#### China won't rise to hegemon -- its leaders want a peaceful multipolar world order

**Golden 22** -- *Senior Associate Researcher, CIDOB* (Sean, March 2022,
"China's "enlightened authoritarianism" as an alternative to liberal
democracy," Barcelona Centre for International Affairs,

[China wants a new world order, but not the new world order initiated in
Ukraine by the Putin regime. A joint statement issued by China and
Russia before the invasion proposed to "uphold the outcomes of the
Second World War and the existing post-war world order"]{.underline} and
to "resist attempts to deny, distort, and falsify the history of the
Second World War". The Cold War froze in place one aspect of that
outcome ---the Yalta agreement. The fall of the USSR eroded that example
of Realpolitik. The Warsaw Pact disappeared but NATO expanded, claiming
interests that run from Vladivostok to Vancouver. [China is a nervous
observer of this process.]{.underline}

[The joint statement also proposes to "protect the United Nations-driven
international architecture and the international law-based world order,
seek genuine multipolarity]{.underline}" and to "[promote more
democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and
sustainable development across the world".]{.underline} Implicit in this
catalogue, in addition to a defence of the veto power of the victors in
WWII, is a criticism of a world order dominated in the voting systems of
the Bretton Woods institutions by the USA and Western Europe, and the
elevation of the losing WWII enemies (Germany and Japan) to the status
of NATO allies at the cost of two of the winning allies (then the USSR
and the Republic of China, now Russia and the PRC). [More important is
the insistence on "genuine multipolarity", "more democratic
international relations" and "sustainable development" without
interference in the interest of developed countries.]{.underline}

[China cannot endorse what Russia has done in Ukraine because the
maintenance of territorial integrity is primordial in Chinese foreign
policy, with special reference to the reintegration of Taiwan and
resistance to secessionist movements within continental
China]{.underline}. [Ukraine is also an important partner for China in
terms of raw materials and the Belt and Road Initiative. But China
cannot align itself either with a US-dominated NATO that it sees as an
instrument of US hegemony]{.underline}. The situation is fluid, but
[China is trying to maintain an equidistant stance and would prefer to
broker a return to a pacific rules-based world order founded on a
balance of power that favours neither NATO nor Russia]{.underline}. Such
a stance is probably more in tune with the attitude of the developing
world ---the largest part of the world's population--- as long as [China
itself does not exhibit hegemonic tendencies.]{.underline}

[Uncertainty about the constancy and reliability of the USA as a world
leader]{.underline} [(NATO's point of view)]{.underline} [or as a
hegemonic power]{.underline} ([the point of view of Russia and China and
developing countries) have eroded America's moral authority in world
affairs.]{.underline} "[America First" and neo-isolationism could return
to power in 2024 elections]{.underline} and the current opposition party
flirts with and even endorses populist nationalism and white supremacy,
defending a right-wing insurrection as "normal political discourse". At
the same time, Vladimir Putin's return to a nineteenth century "Great
Powers" vision of the world order as a response to NATO's abandonment of
the "Yalta Agreement" that cemented a post-World War II order is not the
alternative that China wants\[CC1\] .

[Xi]{.underline} [Jinping offers his "China Model" as an alternative to
neo-liberalism in a new world order. China advocates a diverse and
multipolar world as an alternative to US/NATO hegemony]{.underline}. The
[architect of Xi's China Model ideology has been Wang Huning, a discrete
member of the current Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the
PRC, who together with Wang Qishan may be one of the most powerful
leaders in China]{.underline}. It will be interesting to see what
happens with both, Wang's as well as Xi, in the renovation of the
Politburo and Standing Committee later this year

In a period when [liberal democratic political systems have been riven
by radical polarisation, lack of a broad consensus, hostile party
politics and rampant inequality, China offers its version of an
efficient technocratic "benevolent authoritarianism" as an
alternative.]{.underline} [Confucian political philosophy always
advocated government based on 仁 rén, a concept with connotations of
human, humane and humanitarian, as well as empathy, compassion and
reciprocity]{.underline}. The associated concept 共 gòng emphasises the
common good, the commonwealth, as opposed to 私 sī, private interest.

The Party's think tanks promote "Studies on China's National Condition"
(国情研究 Guóqíng yánjiū), developing the idea that [China is peaceful
by nature and will not be aggressive but will pursue "benevolent
pacifism", "peaceful development", "harmonious society", a "harmonious
world" and "harmonious inclusionism" or win-win diplomacy foreign trade
and foreign policy.]{.underline} The Party insists that it is the only
guarantor of social equity and peaceful sustainable development,
rejecting a multiparty system with alternation in power among diverse
political parties because each political "party" is "partial" and only
"a part" of society --- only the Communist Party is "common" to all of
society

Another key organic intellectual, Wang Shaoguang, distinguishes between
"formal" democratic governance ("there are some political systems that,
in terms of form, because they use competitive elections, appear to be
'representative,' yet their responsiveness may not be very high") and
"responsive" governance ("there are some political systems without
multi-party elections but which are quite responsive to the people's
demands"). He argues that, unlike Western liberal democracy, "[what
Chinese sages focused on ... was not the form of government or the form
of the political system, but rather the way of government or the goals
and methods in the functioning of the political system]{.underline}".
And he insists that the "[China model" offers advantages over liberal
democracy's "veto players" ---political parties, lobbies, interest
groups--- in promoting social equity and responsiveness to popular
needs]{.underline}. He also cautions that although having few "veto
players" in the Chinese political system may be an advantage for a
problem-solving system of governance, it can also become a danger if
centralised control of power fails to be responsive to the needs of the
common good, a problem not yet entirely solved in the case of the PRC.

It remains to be seen whether China's alternative can take hold in the
face of NATO's attempt to forge a unified response to the Ukrainian war.

#### Afghanistan and economic instability deck sustainability

\"Bin Laden and Trump: Two Bookends to America\'s Imperial Decline,\"
Foreign Policy In Focus,
https://fpif.org/bin-laden-and-trump-two-bookends-to-americas-imperial-decline/)//KH

The end of 2021 and the beginning of a new year is a convenient time to
take stock of the causes of America's decline.

This past year saw both Washington's inglorious exit from Afghanistan
after 20 years in the country that had served as the launching pad for
its direct military intervention in the Middle East and an historic
insurrection at the very heart of the empire. Add to this the [absolute
lack of traction for President Biden's recent "Democracy Summit" in
contrast to Beijing's surefooted diplomacy, the erosion of an already
weak U.S. economy by COVID-19 followed by uncontrolled inflation, and
the deepening of the country's informal but very real civil war --- and
it is hard to avoid the sense that we are indeed at the end of an
era.]{.underline}

Serving as the bookends of this era were two individuals that stamped
their personalities on it: Osama bin Laden at the beginning and Donald
Trump at the end.

Varieties of Imperial Decline

Ever since Paul Kennedy wrote The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,
historians and others have tried to discover the universal elements of
the phenomenon he called "imperial overstretch."

This might, however, be a futile enterprise. Tolstoy said that all
families are unhappy but each of them is unhappy in its own way. The
same thing might be said of the end of empires. All empires end, but
[each exits in its own distinct unhappy fashion.]{.underline}

Bankrupt at the end of the Second World War and facing spiraling
financial and political costs as independence movements challenged their
hegemony from East Asia to Africa, the British chose to cut their losses
and liquidate most of their holdings, passed the task of ruling to
indigenous elites, and largely left the defense of global capitalism to
the Americans.

The French chose to hang on despite defeat in Indochina and a bloody
stalemate in Algeria and could only be persuaded to give the latter
independence when renegade military men threatened to take over the
government itself to continue the empire. The Soviet Union was largely
dissolved by a domestic reform effort that ran out of control, though
defeat in Afghanistan made a not insignificant contribution.

Like the ascent to the zenith of empire, [the descent from it does not
follow a predetermined path but one that is shaped by contingencies,
many of them surprising and unexpected.]{.underline}

At the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. had staved off the economic
challenge of Japan and seen the political and military challenge posed
by the Soviets dissipate. Moreover, it seemed to have thrown off the
"Vietnam Syndrome" with its victory over Saddam Hussein in the first
Gulf War. The American Empire appeared to be experiencing a second wind.

At this juncture, the choices for maintaining the empire boiled down to
two. One, identified with [the Democrats, favored the U.S. ruling via a
multilateral economic order undergirded by the supremacy of its
corporations and a liberal global political order propped up by
unchallenged American military power and promoted by the "soft power" of
liberal democracy.]{.underline} The other was championed by
neoconservatives largely ensconced in the [Republican Party who claimed
the "unipolar" status of the United States provided a unique opportunity
for reordering the world to the lasting advantage of the United States
both strategically and economically]{.underline} --- and demanded
unilateral action to bring that about.

The debate between these two visions of the imperial future dominated
American politics during the eight-year reign of the Democrats presided
over by Bill Clinton.

Under the succeeding Republican administration of George W. Bush, US
power was primed to do just what the neoconservatives wanted. It was,
however, not predetermined that the Middle East would be the prime
target of their global push to reorder the world. Tension with China was
high in the first months of the new administration, with the Pentagon,
in fact, identifying Beijing no longer as a strategic partner, as the
Clinton administration did, but as a strategic rival. A new Cold War
could have been launched at that juncture, with a China that was much,
much weaker militarily and economically relative to the U.S. than it is
now.

What made the difference in the fateful calculations of the neocons was
one man: Osama bin Laden.

Bin Laden's Historic Role

Bin Laden puts paid to those historians who belittle the role of
personality in history. For what he did, probably without intending it,
was direct U.S. military power to Afghanistan and the broader Middle
East with his attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.

B[in Laden hoped to create a hundred Islamic insurgencies by boldly
baiting the Great Satan, much like Che Guevara hoped to create more
Cubas in Latin America with his guerrilla experiment in
Bolivia]{.underline}. Bin Laden failed in bringing about the purifying
Islamic revolutions he sought, but h[e was wildly successful in a way he
had not intended. For his move gave the American neocons the opportunity
for the military action they had devoutly wished for to enable them to
consolidate their new unipolar order.]{.underline}

[Desire did not, however, end up with the object of desire, for the
terrain in which the U.S. chose to wage an "exemplary war"]{.underline}
to teach the rest of the world to get out of the way of America's
[hegemonic mission turned out to be populated by people, Afghans and
Iraqis, who were no pushovers.]{.underline}

[Bush II got the war he wanted but not the outcome he
sought]{.underline}. Instead of his legions coming back home in triumph,
they were plunged into what quickly became a quicksand from which they
could not be extricated for two decades, and then [only in shame and
defeat under a Democratic administration in 2021.]{.underline}

The Economic Consequences of the Forever Wars

Being pinned down in what critics called the "[forever wars" in the
Middle East had momentous political and economic consequences for the
United States. Washington set aside its definition of China as a
strategic rival and sought instead to enlist Beijing as an ally in its
"war on terror."]{.underline} China obliged, but devoted most of its
efforts to economic diplomacy to gain markets and cultivate good
relations with countries in the Global South, a contrast with
Washington's bellicose behavior that did not go unnoticed.

The U.S. wasted trillions on fruitless military adventures, but the main
economic consequence of the Middle East wars was to boost China's
economic ascent at its expense.

With China reaffirmed as a political ally, the U.S[. transnational
corporations that had promoted the entente with China in their search
for cheap labor]{.underline} during the Clinton presidency accelerated
the transfer of their manufacturing processes to China, making t[he 16
years of the Bush II and Obama administrations a period of irreversible
deindustrialization. Thousands of factories closed down in the
industrial heartland in the Midwest and Northeast and at least 2.5
million high paying manufacturing jobs were lost to what some economists
called the "China Shock."]{.underline}

China's rise to industrial prominence was not, in other words,
predetermined. [Bin Laden's baiting the U.S. --- and Washington taking
the bait --- was a major reason why the China-TNC alliance continued and
gathered force during the Bush II presidency instead of being sidelined
by strategic concerns]{.underline} about China that were prominent both
at the Pentagon and the neocons during Bush's first months in office.

#### Unsustainable -- rising risk of civil war and domestic economic strife

**Bello 22** -- *PhD, Princeton, sociology, professor at Cal Berkeley,
former member of the Philippines House of Reps* (Walden, 1-12-2022,
\"Bin Laden and Trump: Two Bookends to America\'s Imperial Decline,\"
Foreign Policy In Focus,
https://fpif.org/bin-laden-and-trump-two-bookends-to-americas-imperial-decline/)//KH

Trump and the Crisis of the Imperial Order

But [endless wars and the unraveling of the financialized U.S. economy
are insufficient to explain the drastic decline of the empire from
"unipolarism" to severe dislocation in less than two
decades.]{.underline} One must [bring into the equation the unfolding of
what I have called the informal civil war in the United States. Central
to explaining this cancer eating at the heart of the American political
system was the evolution of white supremacy]{.underline} as a political
and ideological force.

While the Republican Party had exploited the racial insecurities of the
white population successfully since the late 1960s through the so-called
"Southern Strategy" and racist dog whistle politics, [it was not
predetermined that white supremacy would become the dominant stream in
conservative, right-wing politics that would subordinate and fuse with
other streams such as cultural and religious conservatism,
anti-liberalism]{.underline}, and populist disdain for scientific
expertise.

Again, this was not inevitable. A key contribution to the expansion and
consolidation of white supremacy was the defection from the Democratic
Party of large sections of its white working class base --- the pillar
of the once solid "New Deal Coalition" put together by Franklin Delano
Roosevelt --- as "Third Way" Democrats from Clinton to Barack Obama
legitimized and led in promoting neoliberal policies that had such a
damaging consequences on the jobs and income of workers.

The Democratic Party leadership's [surrender to neoliberalism has been
well analyzed by Thomas Piketty, who noted that the base of the party
from the 1960s on increasingly became composed of people with relatively
high levels of education]{.underline} --- professionals, academics,
intellectuals, and even managers. The relatively [well educated
leadership of the party increasingly responded to the interests of these
like-minded followers, resulting in many in the old union, working class
base being steadily alienated from them]{.underline}.

Increasingly, what Piketty terms the "[Brahmin Left" in the Democratic
Party represented by the Clintons and Obama found a coincidence of
intellectual and material interests with conservatives traditionally
ensconced in the Republican Party.]{.underline} Their common agenda came
to be espousal of neoliberalism, with the difference that the Democrats
favored neoliberalism with "safety nets." This ideological convergence
assured that while the independent left would be loud in its
denunciation of neoliberalism, the dominant political response to
neoliberalism would not come from the left but from another quarter when
the right conjuncture emerged.

That conjuncture came with the outbreak of t[he Great Recession in 2008.
Its volatile mix of high unemployment and high inequality provided an
indispensable context for white supremacy's breaking out to become the
driving force of the politics of the white population,]{.underline} a
development that took liberals and others by surprise.

Still, it could not have turned into the virulent, destabilizing
movement it became were it not for one man. This brings us again to the
role of personality, a factor that at certain historical junctures can
become decisive. It was a volatile opportunist with weak ties to either
the Republican establishment or Democratic establishment who elevated
white supremacy from one of several streams of American right-wing
politics to its hegemonic status.

In the 2016 elections, Donald Trump smelled an opportunity that a
Democratic leadership tied to Wall Street ignored. By tying the crisis
created by deindustrialization, financialization, and neoliberalism to
anti-migrant rhetoric and dog whistle anti-black appeals in a
boisterous, redneck-captivating style, he was able to break through to
the white working class that had already given signals earlier that it
was ripe to be mobilized along racial lines.

The [culmination of that process was the January 6 insurrection, a
battle that Trump lost]{.underline} which may actually serve as a
prelude to his winning the war, just as the failed Munich Beer Hall
Putsch in 1923 prefigured Hitler's gaining power in 1933.

A Third Wind?

As the era 2001 to 2021 comes to an end, the American empire continues
to be dominant, but its pillars have been severely eroded.

Its [ability to discipline the rest of the world has been shattered by
its defeat in Afghanistan. Its credibility even among its western allies
as a reliable partner is at an all-time low. Its economy may still be
the largest in the word, but it is no longer the center of global
capital accumulation and confronts the prospect of its unraveling
accelerating --- especially now that the \$1.75 trillion "Build Back
Better" social and climate public spending bill that was supposed to be
its program for revitalization faces uncertain approval]{.underline} in
a deeply divided Congress. Meanwhile white supremacist politics has
become the hegemonic force in the politics of the white population,
creating not only deep polarization but an existential threat to the
world's oldest democracy itself.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the U.S. empire seemed to have a second wind,
appearing to have put the "Vietnam Syndrome" behind it and its economy
apparently gliding into a prosperous maturity. As events proved, that
illusory second wind was short lived.

A third wind is, of course, a theoretical possibility. But while we
should be wary of deterministic projections, how such a rejuvenation can
take place is much, much less evident today. Each empire descends from
the zenith in its own unique way, but if there is one path that is
broadly similar to that being trodden by the United States, it is that
of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. Like the Ottomans then,
the [United States now is a very sick empire, faced abroad by powerful
challenges to its hegemony, eroded by economic stagnation, shorn of
ideological legitimacy, and torn apart internally by a civil war in all
but name]{.underline}.

#### Hegemony collapse via Chinese economic and military takeover is inevitable

**McCoy 22** -- *Alfred McCoy is the J.R.W. Smail Professor of History
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison* (Alfred, 2-25-2022, \"Will the
Fight for Hegemony Survive Climate Change?,\" Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-china-usa-beijing/)//KH

[Consider us **at the edge** of the sort of epochal change not seen for
centuries]{.underline}, even millennia. By the middle of this century,
[we will be living under such radically altered circumstances that the
present decade, the 2020s, will undoubtedly seem like another era
entirely]{.underline}, akin perhaps to the Middle Ages. And I'm not
talking about the future development of flying cars, cryogenics, or even
as-yet-unimaginable versions of space travel.

After leading the world for the past 75 years, [the **U**nited
**S**tates is ever so fitfully losing its grip on global hegemony. As
Washington's power begins to fade, the liberal international system it
created]{.underline} by founding the United Nations in 1945 [is facing
potentially fatal challenges.]{.underline}

After more than 180 years of Western global dominion, [leadership is
beginning to move from West to East, where Beijing is likely to become
the epicenter of a new world order that could indeed rupture
longstanding Western traditions of law]{.underline} and human rights.

More crucially, however, [after two centuries of propelling the world
economy to unprecedented prosperity, the use of fossil
fuels---especially coal and oil---will undoubtedly fade away within the
next couple of decades]{.underline}. Meanwhile, for the first time since
the last Ice Age ended 11,000 years ago, thanks to the greenhouse gases
those fossil fuels are emitting into the atmosphere, the [world's
climate is changing in ways that will,]{.underline} by the middle of
this century, [start to render significant parts of the planet
uninhabitable for a quarter, even possibly half, of
humanity.]{.underline}

For the first time in 800,000 years, [the level of carbon dioxide (CO2)
in the atmosphere has blown past earlier highs of 280 parts per million
to reach 410 parts.]{.underline} That, in turn, is unleashing climate
feedback loops that, [by century's end, if not well before, will aridify
the globe's middle latitudes, partly melt the polar ice caps, and raise
sea levels drastically.]{.underline} (Don't even think about a future
Miami or Shanghai!)

In trying to imagine how such changes will affect an evolving world
order, is it possible to chart the future with something better than
mere guesswork? My own field, history, generally performs poorly when
trying to track the past into the future, while social sciences like
economics and political science are loath to project much beyond
medium-term trends (say, the next recession or election). Uniquely among
the disciplines, however, environmental science has developed diverse
analytical tools for predicting the effects of climate change all the
way to this century's end.

Those predictions have become so sophisticated that world leaders in
finance, politics, and science are now beginning to think about how to
reorganize whole societies and their economies to accommodate the
projected disastrous upheavals to come. Yet surprisingly few of us have
started to think about the likely impact of climate change upon global
power. By combining political projections with already carefully plotted
trajectories for climate change, it may, however, be possible to see
something of the likely course of governance for the next half century
or so.

To begin with the most immediate changes, [social-science analysis has
long predicted the end of US global power. Using economic projections,
the US National Intelligence Council, for instance, stated that, by
2030, "Asia will have surpassed North America and Europe combined in
terms of global power,"]{.underline} while "[China alone will probably
have the largest economy, surpassing that of the **U**nited **S**tates a
**few years before 2030**."]{.underline} Using similar methods, the
accounting firm PwC calculated that [China's economy would become **60
percent larger** than that of the **U**nited **S**tates by
2030.]{.underline}

If climate science proves accurate, however, [the hegemony Beijing could
achieve by perhaps 2030 will last]{.underline}, at best, [only a couple
of decades]{.underline} or less [before unchecked global warming
ensures]{.underline} that the very concept of [world
dominance,]{.underline} as we've known it historically since the
sixteenth century, [may be relegated to a past age like so much else in
our world.]{.underline}

Considering that likelihood as we peer dimly into the decades [between
2030 and 2050 and beyond, the international community will]{.underline}
surely have good reason to **[forge a new kind of world
order]{.underline}---**one made for a planet truly in danger and unlike
any that has come before.

#### Unsuccessful pursuit of hegemony over China worsens current unsustainability, blows back, and pushes climate over the brink

**McCoy 22** -- *Alfred McCoy is the J.R.W. Smail Professor of History
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison* (Alfred, 2-25-2022, \"Will the
Fight for Hegemony Survive Climate Change?,\" Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-china-usa-beijing/)//KH

A planet ever more battered by climate change, one in which neither an
American nor a Chinese "century" will have any meaning, will certainly
need a newly empowered world order that can supersede national
sovereignty to protect the most fundamental and transcendent of all
human rights: survival. [The environmental changes in the offing are so
profound that anything less than a new form of democratic global
governance will mean not just incessant conflicts but, in all
likelihood, disaster of an almost-unimaginable kind]{.underline}. And no
surprise there, since [we'll be dealing with a planet all too
**literally on the brink.**]{.underline}

Whenever you hear senior [US officials tout Washington's determination
to "shape" the world order pursuant to America's vision of all that is
right and good,]{.underline} make sure you have your flak jacket handy.
In practice, "[shaping" typically culminates in exchanges of
gunfire]{.underline}.

Recently, in a much-anticipated speech, Secretary of State Anthony
Blinken outlined the Biden administration's plan to "shape the strategic
environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open, inclusive
international system." In an age that celebrates openness and
inclusivity, Blinken's vision sounds benign.

Yet, to judge by the recent past, this [latest effort to shape will
leave Americans and the world worse off. To shape is to
impose.]{.underline} Incorporating expectations of compliance, the
effort is inherently coercive. [When the United States sets out to
shape, **brace yourself for blowback.**]{.underline}

Recall that [during the Cold War, US strategy had centered on
containment.]{.underline} However imperfectly implemented, the
overarching idea was quite specific: Prevent the spread of communism and
avert a cataclysmic Third World War. Yet the Cold War's abrupt
conclusion in [1989 found the world's sole remaining superpower in a
dominant position without any sense of how to put that dominance to
work.]{.underline}

The possibility of claiming a "peace dividend"---the Pentagon
effectively declaring Mission Accomplished---apparently never received
more than perfunctory consideration. Refashioning the old mission into a
new, more proactive one caught Washington's fancy instead.
[Shaping---bringing the world into conformity with American values and
interests---appeared to fill the bill.]{.underline}

Back in September 1993, Anthony Lake, then serving as national security
adviser to President Bill Clinton, unveiled this project, which he
styled a "strategy of enlargement." This strategy was not an explicitly
military enterprise. Its advertised purpose, according to Lake, was to
"mobilize our nation in order to enlarge democracy, enlarge markets, and
enlarge our future"---shaping over multiple dimensions.

Yet Clinton administration exertions in Somalia, Haiti, the Balkans, and
the Persian Gulf soon revealed a preference for taking a strong-arm
approach. To invade, occupy, overthrow---or at the very least
bomb---seemingly offered an expedient way of obliging the recalcitrant
to shape up. With Donald Trump a partial exception, Clinton's successors
endorsed that proposition.

[Even as the US penchant for armed intervention grew (and as Pentagon
spending soared), the advertised rationale of the enterprise remained as
Lake had described it: to shape an international order conducive to
liberal democratic values.]{.underline} Especially after 9/11, however,
any connection between those values and the outcomes actually
achieved---not to mention the means employed---became increasingly
difficult to discern. [In the Greater Middle East, shaping soon yielded
to the forever war]{.underline}.

When former president George W. Bush recently confused Russia's war in
Ukraine with the American war in Iraq that he had inaugurated in 2003,
he came precariously close to uttering a very uncomfortable truth. If
not siblings, the two conflicts are at least first cousins---each one an
illegal war of choice recklessly undertaken, each justified by the
flimsiest ideological rationale (liberating Iraq, denazifying Ukraine),
and each resulting in unmitigated disaster.

Even so, as if oblivious to what prior efforts have yielded, the [Biden
administration is now eager to take another stab at shaping---this time
as a response to China's rise]{.underline}. Yet [the China "threat," to
the extent one exists, is not primarily military. It is economic,
commercial, technological, and environmental]{.underline}. If the United
States feels the need to compete with China, it should focus on such
matters.

Imagine, for example, Washington undertaking its own equivalent of
Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, by diverting a measly 10 percent of
the Pentagon's budget to fund international development programs. That
would come to a tidy \$80 billion per year.

Instead, the [Biden administration's major economic initiative in the
region amounts to a hefty serving of weak tea. The Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework isn't even a trade agreement---it's an agreement to begin
consultations over negotiations about regional rules and
standards.]{.underline} If that doesn't sound very exciting to you,
you're not alone---IPEF has utterly failed to resonate among the nations
America hopes to enlist in our "shaping" project. It's akin to an
invitation to a party no one wants to attend

An African diplomat is said to have remarked that every time China
visits we get a hospital, while every time Britain visits we get a
lecture. The diplomat might have added that when the US visits, it does
so to display American military might. Rather than an invitation to
partner, the implicit message is one of paternalism: You need our
protection. [America's actual effort to shape the strategic environment
around China will instead emphasize bases, enhanced power projection
capabilities, provocative military exercises, and arms sales. Indeed,
these already describe the principal facets of the Pentagon's
much-touted Asian "pivot." Needless to say, the Pentagon budget
continues to grow apace.]{.underline}

Back in 1993, Anthony Lake proposed his Strategy of Enlargement just two
weeks before the famous Mogadishu firefight blew a hole in the Clinton
administration's naive expectations of shaping the future of Somalia.
Nearly 30 years later, US troops remain in that recalcitrantly
out-of-shape country, with mission accomplishment nowhere in sight.

If the United States should take one lesson from its decades in Somalia,
it is this: [Relying on military power to shape the course of events in
distant countries requires very deep pockets and infinite
patience---neither of which we currently possess.]{.underline} And in
comparison with China, Somalia would seem to be an easy case.

[Emphasizing carrots rather than sticks has served China well. The US
reliance on sticks to shape the behavior of others has proven to be a
costly failure.]{.underline} Especially when our real priority should be
to reshape---and repair---our democracy at home, surely we can do
better.

### AT: China Rise

#### China is a defensive realist -- Xi will never go to war with Taiwan and will only practice strategic patience

**Nathan 22** -- *professor at Columbia polisci, Ph.D., Harvard, MA,
Harvard, BA, Harvard* (Andrew J. Nathan, 6-23-2022, \"Beijing Is Still
Playing the Long Game on Taiwan,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-06-23/beijing-still-playing-long-game-taiwan)//KH

[Concern is growing in Taiwan, in the United States, and among U.S.
allies in Asia that China is preparing to attack Taiwan in the near
future]{.underline}. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee last year, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the commander of the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned that Beijing might attempt to seize
the island in the next six years. Unifying Taiwan with mainland China is
a key element of Chinese President Xi Jinping's "Chinese dream." And as
the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro has argued in these pages,
Xi wants "unification with Taiwan to be part of his personal legacy,"
suggesting that an armed invasion could come before the end of his third
term as secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027 and
almost certainly before the end of his probable fourth term in 2032.

[Putin's war in Ukraine has intensified these concerns. Xi's
announcement just before the Russian invasion of a "no limits"
partnership with Moscow, coupled with his failure to condemn Putin's
actions and the Chinese media's endorsement of Russian propaganda, seem
to signal Beijing's support for Russia's territorial
aggression.]{.underline} Beijing may see a strategic opening now that
U.S. political and military resources are tied up in Europe. Moreover,
Chinese leaders may have interpreted the West's response to the Russian
attack as an indication that the United States will not intervene
militarily to defend a country to which it is not bound by a defense
treaty, especially against a nuclear-armed adversary. As David Sacks of
the Council on Foreign Relations has argued, "Chinese policymakers may
conclude that Russia's nuclear arsenal effectively deterred the United
States, which would be unwilling to go to war with a nuclear power over
Taiwan."

But [fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced. For decades,
China's policy toward Taiwan has been characterized by strategic
patience, as has its approach to other territorial claims and
disputes---from India to the South China Sea.]{.underline} Far from
spurring China to jettison this approach in favor of an imminent
military assault on Taiwan, [the war in Ukraine will reinforce Beijing's
commitment to playing the long game. The price Moscow has paid, both
militarily and in the form of international isolation, is but a fraction
of what China could expect if it were to attempt to take Taiwan by
force]{.underline}. [Better to wait patiently for Taiwan's eventual
surrender]{.underline}, as Beijing sees it, than to strike now and risk
winning the island at too high a cost---or losing it forever.

IMPENDING ATTACK?

Fear that China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin
invaded Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a
2021 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests.

In 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan
to normalize relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of
winning over Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically
isolated, militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on
the mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party.

But these efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against
unification in Taiwanese public opinion and politics. According to
opinion polls, the share of Taiwanese voters favoring unification fell
from 28 percent in 1999 to less than two percent in 2022. [An
overwhelming majority favor "maintaining the status quo," which in the
language of Taiwanese politics means sustaining autonomy without
formally declaring independence]{.underline}. Since 2016, the
anti-unification Democratic Progressive Party has controlled both the
presidency and the legislature, and it looks well positioned to win the
next set of national elections in 2024.

[Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced.]{.underline}

These trends have prompted China to adopt a more threatening posture
toward Taiwan. Beijing has stepped up measures to isolate the island
diplomatically, slowed imports and the tourist trade, trained the
Chinese military to conduct the complicated joint operations necessary
for a cross-strait invasion, and conducted frequent probes of Taiwan's
air defense identification zone. China has also developed what the
Pentagon calls "anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including
long-range precision missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship
ballistic missiles, cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to
hold at bay a U.S. defense of Taiwan.

These moves have fed speculation that China is building up to a
full-scale attack. In addition to Xi's desire to secure his legacy, [the
shifting balance of power between China and the United States is often
cited by U.S. analysts as a possible motivation for Xi.]{.underline}
[The scholars Michael **Beckley and** Hal **Brands**, for instance, have
suggested that China may attack in the near term because it has reached
the peak of its national strength---and China's leaders know
it]{.underline}. China is looking at a period of decline caused by a
combination of unsustainable debt, rising labor costs, an aging
population, declining productivity, and a critical water shortage.
Meanwhile, the United States and Taiwan have recently started to
readjust their military postures to counter the asymmetric threat China
poses. The Biden administration is pulling Japan and South Korea
together around a commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait," and
Western businesses are gradually moving their production sites out of
China because of rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in
the Chinese market, and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation
gathers steam, the West's economic incentives to avoid war with China
will diminish. By this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its
adversaries are ready.

WAITING GAME

T[he facts on which such forecasts are based are not wrong, but they are
incomplete. A fuller set of facts suggests that China is still pursuing
a strategy of strategic patience]{.underline} when it comes to Taiwan.
[First, Chinese leaders---rightly or wrongly---seem confident that they
can handle their own problems better than the West can handle its
problems]{.underline}. They [don't deny the challenges that Beckley and
Brands highlight, but they believe the West is in decline]{.underline},
hobbled [by ill-managed and slow-growing economies, social divisions,
and weak political leaders]{.underline}. However, [Chinese strategists
do not seem to believe that China has yet reached a favorable power
balance with the West]{.underline}. As Yan Xuetong, dean of the
Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, has argued,
"[China's global reach still has its limits. Despite being a major
power, China also thinks of itself as a developing country---and rightly
so, considering that its GDP per capita remains far behind those of
advanced economies]{.underline}."

[Beijing can afford to wait for power in the Western Pacific to tip
decisively in its favor. When Washington comes to understand that the
cost of defending Taiwan is beyond its means, and Taiwanese officials
realize that Washington no longer has the appetite for a clash with
China, Taiwan will pragmatically negotiate an arrangement that Beijing
can accept.]{.underline} In the meantime, China needs only to deter
Taipei and Washington from attempting to lock in formal Taiwanese
independence[. Beijing's shows of force are not precursors of an
imminent attack, therefore, but measures intended to buy
time]{.underline} for history to take its course.

Second, contrary to the common portrayal of China as itching for war,
[Beijing has demonstrated strategic patience in pursuit of its other
goals. A good example is Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea,
where China has built and militarized seven sand islands without
triggering a war with the United States or rival territorial
claimants]{.underline}. It did so by building only on landforms it
already controlled, claiming all along that it wasn't doing what it was
doing. The [rival territorial claimants were too weak to confront China,
while the United States lacked a justification for doing so because it
has no territorial claims where China was building]{.underline}. Beijing
restricted access to but refrained from seizing a landform it contests
with the sole U.S. treaty ally involved in these disputes---the
Philippines---which in any case lacked an appetite to invoke its
alliance with Washington by moving militarily to defend itself.

The conflict in Ukraine is reminding Xi that war is unpredictable and
rule over a resisting population is costly.

[China likewise changed the strategic status quo without triggering an
armed conflict over the contested Senkaku Islands]{.underline}, known in
China as the Diaoyu Islands, [by escalating from an occasional maritime
presence in Japanese waters to a permanent one]{.underline},
supplementing its naval forces with less confrontational coast guard,
maritime militia, and fishing vessels. [Beijing followed a similar
playbook in the contested Ladakh region of India, where Chinese troops
gradually advanced their positions and established a series of new lines
of control]{.underline} with only one confirmed outbreak of shooting
that was quickly contained.

[China has invested in ostensibly civilian port projects across the
Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as foundations for future naval
operations, raising some alarm but no counteraction]{.underline}.
Beijing has also used its economic and diplomatic influence in Africa,
Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Oceania and its norm-setting
power in international institutions to incentivize governments to align
with China's interests, again generating some alarm but no effective
resistance. [Such diplomatic, economic, and military "**gray zone
tactics"** illustrate that China's strategic behavior is geared toward
the long term rather than the short term, moving from no presence to
sustained presence in a host of arenas without generating substantial
pushback, much less armed conflict (with the exception of the fighting
in Ladakh]{.underline}). That same strategic caution has so far been
evident in China's policy toward Taiwan, where Beijing has dialed up
tension and deterred a Taiwanese drive for independence without
precipitating a crisis.

Finally, [the lesson Xi is likely drawing from Putin's war in Ukraine is
not that territorial aggression would go unpunished militarily by the
West but that it would be both difficult and costly.]{.underline} There
is no reason to believe that Xi is surrounded, as Putin seems to be, by
yes men who will tell him that a war over Taiwan can be easily won.
[Even if he is, however, the grinding conflict in Ukraine is reminding
him that war is unpredictable and rule over a resisting population is
costly. The amphibious operation China would need to undertake to seize
Taiwan would be far more difficult than the land invasion Russia has
carried out in Ukraine]{.underline}. Xi has been reforming the Chinese
military's command structure and ramping up training for such an
operation, but Chinese forces remain untested in actual combat
operations. Meanwhile, [the chances that the United States would
intervene to defend Taiwan have increased as anti-Chinese sentiment has
risen in the United States and Europe]{.underline}---and after U.S.
President Joe Biden remarked last month that defending Taiwan is "the
commitment we made."

[Even if Beijing could win a war over Taiwan, it is unclear that it
could win what would come next.]{.underline} As painful as Russia's
isolation from Western economies has been for Moscow, the [postwar
scenario for the Chinese economy would be even more damaging. China
imports 70 percent of its oil and 31 percent of its natural gas; it is
the world's largest coal producer but still needs to import
more.]{.underline} Although it is striving for food self-sufficiency,
[China is the world's largest importer of food,]{.underline} especially
corn, meat, seafood, and soybeans. Some of these [energy and food
imports come from Russia, but many come from countries that would
sanction China if it invaded Taiwan.]{.underline} And even if they did
not, [China's navy doesn't have the global reach to defend the shipping
routes across which these and many other vital commodities flow. Any war
over Taiwan, even a successful one for Beijing, would deal a devastating
blow to the Chinese economy, creating conditions that would threaten
domestic political stability]{.underline} and usher in the failure, not
the realization, of the Chinese dream.

FIGHTING PATIENCE WITH PATIENCE

None of this is reason for American or Taiwanese complacency. China is
following the dictum of the ancient strategist Sun-tzu: "To subdue the
enemy without fighting is the acme of skill." If Beijing eventually
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it will fatally undermine Washington's
credibility with its Asian---and even its European---allies, challenging
Australia, Japan, South Korea, and other countries to either come to
terms with China or prepare to defend themselves without American help.

[The only way to defeat China's Taiwan strategy of strategic patience is
to exercise corresponding patience, continually adapting American and
Taiwanese deterrence as Chinese arms and training present an
ever-changing and ever-growing threat.]{.underline} This is a tall order
for the United States at a time when its share of global GDP has
declined to less than 25 percent (from 40 percent in 1960) and the U.S.
Navy complains that it doesn't have enough ships to perform all the
missions it is charged with. It is an even taller order for an island
that spends only 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense and that has only
recently begun to move away from an unrealistic reliance on expensive
advanced platforms to stave off a Chinese attack and toward a more
realistic "porcupine strategy" involving mines, short-range missiles,
civil defense, and guerrilla resistance. But if a prolonged standoff in
the Taiwan Strait is the most likely prospect for the future, the side
that that stays in the game the longest is the one that is likely to
come out on top.

#### China isn't revisionist -- economic interdependence and conflict avoidance

**Bader 16** -- *the senior director for Asian affairs on the National
Security Council in the Obama Administration and a former United States
Ambassador to Namibia* (Jeffrey, February 2016, "How Xi Jinping Sees the
World . . . and Why," Brookings Institution,
https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/xi_jinping_worldview_bader-1.pdf)//KH

China's rise has rightfully been drawing attention since long before Xi
Jinping assumed office. But [questions about whether China is a threat
to the international system, a revisionist power, and a would-be
regional hegemon have become much sharper in the three
years]{.underline} since he assumed leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party. How valid are such concerns?

Xi is certainly a more forceful, assertive, and ambitious leader than
his predecessor. He has behind him a China with greater
capacity---economic and military---than any of his predecessors.

China's regional and global footprint is considerably larger than
before, and this has made countries near and far anxious. But [it would
be a mistake, in my view, to view the evolution of China in the last few
years primarily as the product of the vision and imagination of an
aggressive leader.]{.underline} Most of the actions and trends that
worry [observers have been present for some time: the military build-up,
the assertive behavior in the South and East China Sea, the growing
gravitational pull of China's economy, and the political repression and
denial of basic rights to its citizens.]{.underline} There are questions
that deserve attention about how Xi is steering China. But the larger
questions about China's direction both pre-date and will post-date Xi's
tenure.

China is likely to continue, whether under Xi or his successor, to
follow a zig-zag path in its attitude toward the international system
similar to the one described in this paper. [It will further develop its
relationship with the international system and interdependence with
other countries, but at the same selectively adhere to international
norms where they fit its interests and ignore or seek to change them
where they do not. For]{.underline} example, Chinese economic success is
firmly anchored in its relationship with other markets. [Autarky and
self-reliance are not feasible alternatives]{.underline}. [China
benefits from international rules and norms]{.underline} not only [in
the trade and investment area, but in the security realm as well.
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and
uncontrolled ethnic and civil strife]{.underline} in Central and Western
Asia [would be damaging to China's interests.]{.underline}

### AT: Kagan

#### Kagan's research method is biased and obfuscates American interventionist mistakes

**Bacevich 22** -- *Professor Emeritus of International Relations and
History at Boston University* (Andrew J. Bacevich, April 13, 2022,
\"Robert Kagan\'s Selective Memory,\" American Conservative,
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/robert-kagans-selective-memory/)//KH

In the pages of Foreign Affairs, [the indefatigable Robert Kagan
recently weighed in with yet another fervent appeal on behalf of
empire]{.underline}. [Ever the true-blue American, Kagan avoids using
the offensive E-word, of course. He favors the term
hegemony]{.underline}, which, he explains, is benign, involving neither
domination nor exploitation but willing submission---"more a condition
than a purpose." Scratch the surface, however, and "[The Price of
Hegemony" offers a variation on Kagan's standard theme: the imperative
of militarized U.S. global primacy, whatever the price and with little
regard for who pays.]{.underline}

[Few would charge Kagan with being a deep or original thinker. As a
writer, he is less philosophe than pamphleteer, albeit one possessing a
genuine gift for packaging]{.underline}. Recall, for example, his famous
assertion that "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus."
Once deemed to express a truth of Lippmannesque profundity, [this
warriors vs. wimps formulation has since lost much of its persuasive
appeal, not least because the warriors, a.k.a. "the troops," have not
fared especially well when dispatched to liberate, pacify, or
depose.]{.underline}

So rather than being enshrined alongside Walter Lippmann, Kagan will
likely share the fate of Scotty Reston or Joe Alsop, once prominent
Washington-based columnists who are now totally forgotten. Of course,
much the same fate awaits the entire gaggle of commentators (this writer
included) who pontificate on America's role in the world under the
mistaken impression that senior officials in the White House, Foggy
Bottom, or the Pentagon seek their counsel. Rarely do they do so.

That said, Kagan stands out from the rest of the pack in one respect:
His knack for combining consistency with flexibility is matchless. He is
nothing if not nimble. Whatever may occur in the real world, he is ready
with an explanation for how events affirm the indispensability of
assertive American leadership. In Washington (and in the pages of
Foreign Affairs), this is always a welcome conclusion.

This nimbleness is vividly on display in his most recent essay, its
subtitle posing this question: "Can America Learn to Use Its Power[?"
Kagan arrives at his own answer---the United States not only can learn
but must---even as he ignores altogether what the vigorous expenditure
of American power over the past two decades has achieved, and at what
cost.]{.underline}

So [his essay contains various dark references to Russian misbehavior,
along with a handful to objectionable actions by China. Perhaps
inevitably, Kagan also throws in a few ominous allusions to Germany and
Japan in the run up to World War II,]{.underline} in Washington circles
the go-to source of authoritative historical instruction. [As to
post-9/11 U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, he is silent. They
qualify for not a single mention---none, zero, null, nada.]{.underline}

According to Kagan, the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War occurred at least in
part due to American passivity. Successive post-Cold War U.S.
administrations fell down on the job. Put simply, they did not exert
themselves to keep Russia in check. While it would be "obscene to blame
the United States for Putin's inhumane attack on Ukraine," Kagan writes,
to "insist that the invasion was entirely unprovoked is misleading." The
United States had "played a strong hand poorly." In doing so, it gave
Vladimir Putin cause to think that he could get away with aggression.
Thus did Washington---as if sitting on its hands during the first two
decades of the present century---provoke Moscow.

By "wielding U.S. influence more consistently and effectively,"
presidents beginning with the elder Bush could have prevented the
devastation that Ukrainians have suffered. From Kagan's point of view,
the United States has been too passive. Today, he writes, "the question
is whether the United States will continue to make its own
mistakes"---mistakes of inaction, in his view---"or whether Americans
will learn, once again, that it is better to contain aggressive
autocracies early, before they have built up a head of steam."

[The reference to containing aggressive autocracies early requires
decoding. Kagan is dissimulating. What he is actually proposing is
further experiments with preventive war, which in the wake of 9/11
became the centerpiece of U.S. national security policy.
Kagan]{.underline}, of course, [supported the Bush Doctrine of
preventive war. He was all in on invading Iraq. Implemented in 2003 in
the form of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Bush Doctrine produced
disastrous results.]{.underline}

Now, even two decades later, [Kagan cannot bring himself to acknowledge
the grotesque immensity of that mistake]{.underline}, nor its side
effects, to include the rise of Trumpism and all of its ancillary evils.

"[Can America Learn to Use Its Power?" That this rates as an urgent
question is certainly the case. Yet to fancy that Robert Kagan possesses
the qualifications to offer an intelligible answer is a
delusion]{.underline}.

### AT: Transition wars

#### Empirics and growing normal powers ensure hegemony decline will be peaceful! Indicts Kagan specifically!

**Leonard 22** -- *Director of the European Council on Foreign
Relations* (Mark, 6-13-2022, \"The Real End of Pax Americana,\" Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2022-06-13/real-end-pax-americana)//KH

[Greater German and Japanese assertiveness is likely to go hand in hand
with U.S. retrenchment (and a shrinking of Washington's relative
economic and military might) over the long haul,]{.underline} a trend
that is unlikely to change with the war in Ukraine. [The United States
will be forced to concentrate its limited resources on the challenges
posed by China]{.underline}. Analysts such as Robert [Kagan have argued
that Pax Americana could give way to global chaos. That is definitely
possible]{.underline}. But it [is **not what has happened** in much of
the Middle East, where the United States was most engaged for the last
two decades and where it is now pulling back most
dramatically]{.underline}. Julien Barnes-Dacey and Hugh Lovatt of the
European Council on Foreign Relations have described how there was an
initial surge in regional competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia and
in military conflicts that drew in outside powers, such as Russia and
Turkey. But then [many of these **conflicts slowed down,** and more
locally driven reordering processes began]{.underline}, exemplified by
the August 2021 Baghdad conference that brought key regional actors into
dialogue with one another.

[In Europe, U.S. retrenchment could yield greater sovereignty once
Europeans finally realize that the war in Ukraine will not stop
Washington's long-term pivot to Asia]{.underline}. [One reason that
Europeans have failed to develop a common foreign policy is their lack
of trust in one another. But Moscow's aggression has brought Europeans
together, convincing countries that previously favored engagement with
Russia,]{.underline} such as Germany and Italy, to [embrace a policy of
containment]{.underline}. If this convergence holds, one could see a
real European strategic alignment, backed eventually by a European
armaments industry and even conceivably by a more common European
nuclear deterrent (or at least a willingness by France to share its
deterrent). [In the long term, Europe could forge a common framework to
manage relations with other powers, such as Russia and Turkey, including
through deterrence, selective decoupling to minimize tensions, and some
form of dialogue to prevent escalation]{.underline}. Instead of
continuing to expand the EU and NATO, [Europe might opt for smaller,
more flexible multilateral arrangements involving some of the most
important players, much like the Quad in Asia. In short, the European
order might become more Asian.]{.underline}

At the same time, [Asia is likely to become more European. The United
States will maintain its shift in focus to the Indo-Pacific, but its
economic and military weight will shrink compared with
China's]{.underline}. As a result, [Tokyo and other regional powers will
probably strengthen their ties with the United States yet continue to
diversify beyond their traditional alliances with
Washington]{.underline}. As Michishita put it: "[What we are trying to
do is to invite more friends into the Japan-U.S. alliance."]{.underline}
Already [a new Asian order is emerging that includes ties
with]{.underline} the United States and closer cooperation among [powers
such as Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Vietnam.]{.underline} Jimbo says [Asian countries won't form a NATO-like
alliance but rather increase cooperation in areas such as intelligence,
maritime security, and law enforcement]{.underline}. In trade and
commerce, a [certain level of regional integration has already occurred
**without Washington's participation**]{.underline} through the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership---which took shape after the United States walked away from
its predecessor---and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

In terms of security, [a more balanced division of labor could emerge.
Europeans will have to take more direct responsibility for security in
eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East.]{.underline} [In Asia,
regional powers will have to invest more in their own capabilities to
balance Chinese influence in the region]{.underline}. Elbridge Colby,
who served as a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Trump
administration, put it this way in an interview with Nikkei Asia[: "The
United States is 5,000 miles away from Japan and Taiwan, so we need
Japan to do more]{.underline}." And as [the European and Indo-Pacific
theaters become more connected---not least through the Sino-Russian
rapprochement]{.underline}---it is even possible that [European and
Asian powers will support one another]{.underline}. Japan and South
Korea, for instance, might ask Europeans to reciprocate their support
for sanctions on Russia. [The result would be more complex regional
orders in which the United States]{.underline} still plays an important
role but [no longer calls the shots.]{.underline}

### Multipolarity

#### Peaceful multipolarity is likely after a hegemonic decline \-\-- changes in German and Japanese dependence indicate broader regional shift

**Leonard 22** -- *Director of the European Council on Foreign
Relations* (Mark, 6-13-2022, \"The Real End of Pax Americana,\" Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2022-06-13/real-end-pax-americana)//KH

A DIFFERENT KIND OF ALLIANCE

[The Biden administration hopes that the war in Ukraine will cement a
global alliance of democracies, putting both Russia and China on the
back foot.]{.underline} As a result, Beijing regards the conflict as a
proxy war aimed in part at weakening China by convincing Asian countries
of the parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan. The other side of this
coin, of course, is Washington's effort to convince Europeans that if
they want to continue to benefit from U.S. support, they will need to
align with the United States against China.

But [as Germany and Japan become more powerful and more embedded in
their respective regional security orders, they are likely to become
more assertive in setting their own agendas.]{.underline} [That is
precisely what happened in the Middle East, where U.S. retrenchment has
made countries less willing to follow Washington's lead without getting
something in return]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia, for instance, rejected
U.S. requests to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and to increase
oil production to meet elevated demand. Instead, Riyadh worked with
Moscow to keep oil prices high. Other [U.S. allies in the region,
including Israel and the United Arab Emirates, have been similarly
resistant to U.S. demands.]{.underline}

Many American analysts and officials seem to think that the historic
debt of U.S. allies means that they can be expected to side with the
United States against China in more and more domains and at ever greater
cost. Trump provided the perfect illustration of this when he threatened
to withdraw from NATO while demanding that Europeans ban the Chinese
technology giant Huawei from their 5G networks.

But [the changes afoot in Berlin and Tokyo suggest that a different kind
of relationship is on the horizon, one that is more balanced than the
alliances Washington built and maintained in the postwar
era]{.underline}. As the relative importance of U.S. defense
contributions falls and the costs of alignment rise[, it seems unlikely
that Washington will be able to count on automatic support. Instead, the
United States will have to get used to more cooperative and equitable
relationships in which alignment is earned]{.underline}. This will
create challenges and headaches initially, especially as [Washington is
forced to rein in its unipolar instincts. But if the new international
order proves stable and helps promote U.S. interests, American taxpayers
might once again start to see the country's network of alliances as an
asset]{.underline} rather than a drain on public resources. Not only
could the burden of providing security be shared more equitably in such
an order but [the United States and its allies would be able to
establish standards and promote liberal values that, although not solely
American, would definitely be more American than Chinese. In other
words, Pax Americana could give way not to chaos but to a cooperative
model of shared leadership.]{.underline}

IN IT TOGETHER

It [may be easy, and perhaps natural, for the would-be architects of the
new system to organize it around Washington. But that would be a
mistake. The enemies of this new order, united by their resentment of
the United States, will seek to discredit it as just another effort to
dominate global affairs.]{.underline} For this new order to be viable,
it [must be conceived in such a way that the charge is
false.]{.underline}

The [new order must also be decentralized to be effective; the resources
and wisdom needed to solve many vexing problems are not concentrated in
the United States.]{.underline} For instance**, [on the enormous issue
of defining rules for a digitized world,]{.underline}** [Washington has
been confused and passive, despite---or perhaps because of---its
dominance in such commerce.]{.underline} It is the European Union that
has led the way. The [EU's General Data Protection Regulation, its
Digital Services Act, and its Digital Markets Act created the standards
that influence most of the world, including the Americas.]{.underline}
Decentralized leadership has [also proved critical to responding to
Russia's aggression in Ukraine]{.underline}. The [nucleus of the
emerging pro-Ukraine coalition, for instance, is not just the United
States but the entire G-7, including]{.underline} [the European
Commission]{.underline}. South Korea and Australia should be invited to
join this coalition as well.

Yet a revised system of world order shouldn't be limited to the United
States and its traditional allies. It must be open to any countries that
can and will help attain its common objectives. [India should have a
place at any symbolic high table, for example, as a permanent member of
the UN Security Council. But India's leaders are still making their
choices about their will and capacity to work on common problems. Even
China should be welcome at the table.]{.underline} After much internal
debate in the early 1990s, [China's leaders chose to play a major and
often constructive role in the global commonwealth system that emerged
after the end of the Cold War. In 2005, Zoellick famously urged Beijing
to become a "responsible stakeholder.]{.underline}" As late as 2017,
Kurt Campbell, who now leads Asia policy for the Biden White House,
thought this invitation was a wise move.

### Yes Taiwan War

#### China will look at Ukraine as motivation for a speedy, violent attack -- war!

**Brands 22** -- *Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments* (Hal,
4-22-22, \"Putin's Struggles in Ukraine May Embolden Xi on Taiwan,"

One of the biggest questions of the Ukraine war concerns tensions half a
world away: What lessons will China draw from the Russian invasion?

[Western observers hope that Russian President Vladimir Putin's
faltering invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine will convince China to go
slow --- that it [will discourage President Xi Jinping from undertaking
an invasion of Taiwan.]{.underline} Yet [there's a real possibility that
it could actually induce Beijing to go fast --- to use force more
harshly and decisively]{.underline} in hopes of avoiding the type of
quagmire into which Moscow has stumbled.

Learning from other people's wars is a time-honored tradition. In the
early 20th century, Western observers scrutinized the Russo-Japanese war
for hints about the dynamics of modern conflict. During the Cold War,
lessons drawn from the Arab-Israeli wars strongly influenced Moscow's
and Washington's preparations for a superpower showdown that,
mercifully, never occurred.

Today, [Chinese observers are surely scrutinizing events on the
battlefield as well as the global response to Putin's assault. There are
two conflicting narratives about what they are learning.]{.underline}

The first, touted by high-ranking Pentagon officials and some other
analysts, is that Ukraine offers a cautionary tale for Beijing. In this
telling, Chinese officials now see how hard it is to conquer a country
that is fighting for national survival. The People's Liberation Army,
which has not waged a significant conflict in more than 40 years, has
likely been sobered by how poorly another autocratic military has
executed the complex tasks associated with contemporary warfare.

Xi must also be stunned by the performance of US intelligence, which
deprived Putin of anything resembling strategic surprise and has thus
given fair warning that China, too, might have any aggressive plans laid
bare. The economic costs that the democratic world has imposed on
Moscow, the unity it has summoned in response to an unprovoked attack,
and the fact that the conflict is creating a larger, more invigorated
North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot escape Xi's attention, either.

From this vantage point, a bloody war in Europe could help preserve the
peace in Asia. It could force Xi's government to revisit a whole range
of assumptions about how well the PLA would perform under wartime stress
and what consequences a war might bring down on Beijing.

This is certainly the lesson Western officials want Xi to draw --- a
desire that surely reflects some of the self-congratulation that has
crept into the West's assessment of its own performance. If the
democracies have stunned themselves with their support for Ukraine, then
surely Xi has been stunned as well.

Or perhaps China's ruler is drawing a much different lesson.

[Xi has presumably noticed that the US and other democracies have given
arms, training and money to Ukraine but refrained from joining the
fighting. Beijing may not be impressed with the sanctions imposed on
Moscow,]{.underline} given Europe's reluctance to take more drastic
steps, [such as quickly halting purchases of Russian energy, that would
inflict pain on its own citizens. The Chinese know, moreover, that their
larger, more sophisticated economy would be far harder to strangle than
Russia's]{.underline}.

And maybe, [in Xi's view, Putin's mistake was not his decision to invade
Ukraine --- it was that he conducted the invasion in such a bumbling,
indecisive manner, giving the Ukrainians the chance to fight
back]{.underline} and Washington and its allies the opportunity to make
Moscow pay.

This [interpretation might push Xi in a more dangerous direction. It
could convince him that the key to winning a potential Taiwan conflict
is to use overwhelming force]{.underline} --- ~~crippling~~
[\[powerful\] missile barrages, coordinated cyberattacks, assassination
and subversion campaigns, followed by a decisive, large-scale invasion
--- to break the country's resistance before the US and other nations
can get in the way.]{.underline}

This [conclusion would mesh well with a Chinese military tradition that
has long emphasized surprise attacks]{.underline}, and with doctrinal
writings that call for asserting control of a contest in its earliest
moments. "[Seize the battlefield initiative, paralyze the enemy's war
command, and give shock to the enemy's will," one of China's
authoritative military publications exhorts.]{.underline}

There is, unavoidably, some guesswork here. Even talented China watchers
struggle to pierce the opacity of the regime and know what is in Xi's
mind. China's lessons from Ukraine may evolve as the conflict does:
Whether Russia ultimately succeeds or fails could be critical.

The two narratives sketched here aren't even necessarily contradictory.
Putin's difficulties could give Xi pause about whether to invade Taiwan,
while also pushing the PLA to be more forceful in how it conducts any
prospective assault.

Yet [if Xi is as committed to unification with Taiwan as his public
rhetoric and the PLA's feverish preparations suggest, then "go fast" is
at least as plausible a takeaway as "go slow]{.underline}." American
observers need to be wary of mirror-imaging --- of assuming that our
rivals perceive reality as we do. In supporting Ukraine, [the world's
democracies may think they are convincing Xi not to invade Taiwan. They
may simply be encouraging him to do it faster and better.]{.underline}

#### Yes invasion -- any US attempt at deterrence causes a China-Taiwan war

**Mastro 21** -- *Center Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies at Stanford University and a Senior Nonresident
Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute*. (Oriana Skylar,
July/August 2021, \"The Taiwan Temptation,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation)//KH

For more than 70 years, China and Taiwan have avoided coming to blows.
The two entities have been separated since 1949, when the Chinese Civil
War, which had begun in 1927, ended with the Communists' victory and the
Nationalists' retreat to Taiwan. Ever since, the strait separating
Taiwan from mainland China---81 miles wide at its narrowest---has been
the site of habitual crises and everlasting tensions, but never outright
war. For the past decade and a half, cross-strait relations have been
relatively stable. [In the hopes of persuading the Taiwanese people of
the benefits to be gained through a long-overdue unification, China
largely pursued its long-standing policy of "peaceful reunification,"
enhancing its economic, cultural, and social ties with the
island.]{.underline}

To help the people of Taiwan see the light, Beijing sought to isolate
Taipei internationally, offering economic inducements to the island's
allies if they agreed to abandon Taipei for Beijing. It also used its
growing economic leverage to weaken Taipei's position in international
organizations and to ensure that countries, corporations, universities,
and individuals---everyone, everywhere, really---adhered to its
understanding of the "one China" policy. As sharp as these tactics were,
they stopped well short of military action. And although Chinese
officials always maintained that they had a right to use force, that
option seemed off the table.

[In recent months]{.underline}, however, [there have been disturbing
signals that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach and
contemplating armed unification.]{.underline} Chinese President [Xi
Jinping has made clear his ambition to resolve the Taiwan issue, grown
markedly more aggressive on issues of sovereignty]{.underline}, and
[ordered the Chinese military to increase its activity near the
island.]{.underline} He has also [fanned the flames of Chinese
nationalism and allowed discussion of a forceful takeover of Taiwan to
creep into the mainstream of the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP]{.underline}). The [palpable shift in Beijing's thinking has been
made possible by a decades-long military modernization effort,
accelerated by Xi]{.underline}, aimed at allowing China to force Taiwan
back into the fold. Chinese forces plan to prevail even if the United
States, which has armed Taiwan but left open the question of whether it
would defend it against an attack, intervenes militarily. Whereas
Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the island as a
fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility.

[U.S. policymakers may hope that Beijing will balk at the potential
costs of such aggression]{.underline}, [but there are many reasons to
think it might not. Support for armed unification among the Chinese
public and the military establishment is growing. Concern for
international norms is subsiding. Many in Beijing also doubt that the
United States has the military power to stop China from taking
Taiwan---]{.underline}or the international clout to rally an effective
coalition against China in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency.
Although [a Chinese invasion of Taiwan may not be imminent, for the
first time in three decades, it is time to take seriously the
possibility that China could soon use force to end its almost
century-long civil war]{.underline}.

"NO OPTION IS EXCLUDED"

Those who doubt the immediacy of the threat to Taiwan argue that Xi has
not publicly declared a timeline for unification---and may not even have
a specific one in mind. Since 1979, when the United States stopped
recognizing Taiwan, China's policy has been, in the words of John
Culver, a retired U.S. intelligence officer and Asia analyst, "to
preserve the possibility of political unification at some undefined
point in the future." Implied in this formulation is that China can live
with the status quo---a de facto, but not de jure, independent
Taiwan---in perpetuity.

But [although Xi may not have sent out a save-the-date card, he has
clearly indicated that he feels differently about the status quo than
his predecessors did.]{.underline} He has publicly called for progress
toward unification, staking his legitimacy on movement in that
direction. In 2017, for instance, he announced that "complete national
reunification is an inevitable requirement for realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," thus tying Taiwan's future to his
primary political platform. Two years later, he stated explicitly that
unification is a requirement for achieving the so-called Chinese dream.

Xi has also [made clear that he is more willing than his predecessors to
use force]{.underline}. In a major speech in January 2019, Xi [called
the current political arrangement "the root cause of cross-strait
instability" and said that it "cannot go on generation to
generation."]{.underline} Chinese scholars and strategists I have spoken
to in Beijing say that although there is no explicit timeline, [**Xi
wants unification with Taiwan to be part of his personal
legacy.**]{.underline} When asked about a possible timeline by an
Associated Press journalist in April, Le Yucheng, China's vice foreign
minister, did not attempt to assuage concerns of an imminent invasion or
deny the shift in mood in Beijing. Instead, he took the opportunity to
reiterate that national unification "will not be stopped by anyone or
any force" and that [while China will strive for peaceful unification,
it does not "pledge to give up other options. No option is
excluded."]{.underline}

Chinese leaders, including Xi, regularly extol the virtues of
integration and cooperation with Taiwan, but the prospects for peaceful
unification have been dwindling for years. Fewer and fewer Taiwanese see
themselves as Chinese or desire to be a part of mainland China[. The
reelection in January 2020 of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who
favors pursuing more cautious ties with China, reinforced Beijing's
fears that the people of Taiwan will never willingly come back to the
motherland.]{.underline} [The death knell for peaceful unification came
in June 2020, however, when China exerted sweeping new powers over Hong
Kong]{.underline} through a new national security law. Hong Kong's "one
country, two systems" formula was supposed to provide an attractive
template for peaceful unification, but Beijing's crackdown there
demonstrated clearly why the Taiwanese have been right to reject such an
arrangement.

Many in Beijing doubt that the United States has the military power to
stop China from taking Taiwan.

Chinese leaders will continue to pay lip service to peaceful unification
until the day the war breaks out, but their actions increasingly suggest
that they have something else in mind. As tensions with the United
States have heated up[, China has accelerated its military operations in
the vicinity of Taiwan, conducting 380 incursions into the island's air
defense identification zone in 2020 alone.]{.underline} In April of this
year, [China sent its largest-ever fleet, 25 fighters and bombers, into
Taiwan's air defense identification zone]{.underline}. Clearly, Xi is no
longer trying to avoid escalation at all costs now that his military is
capable of contesting the U.S. military presence in the region. Long
gone are the days of the 1996 crisis over Taiwan, when the United States
dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to sail near the strait
and China backed off. [Beijing did not like being deterred back then,
and it spent the next 25 years modernizing its military so that it would
not be so next time.]{.underline}

Much of that [modernization,]{.underline} including updates to hardware,
organization, force structure, and training, was [designed to enable the
People's Liberation Army to invade and occupy Taiwan. Xi expanded the
military's capabilities further, undertaking the most ambitious
restructuring of the PLA since its founding, aimed specifically at
enabling Chinese forces to conduct joint operations in which the air
force, the navy, the army, and the strategic rocket force fight
seamlessly together]{.underline}, whether during an amphibious landing,
a blockade, or a missile attack---exactly the kinds of operations needed
for armed unification. Xi urgently pushed these risky reforms, many
unpopular with the military, to ensure that the PLA could fight and win
wars by 2020.

[The voices in Beijing arguing that it is time to use these newfound
military capabilities against Taiwan have grown louder, a telling
development in an era of greater censorship]{.underline}. Several
[retired military officers have argued publicly that the longer China
waits, the harder it will be to take control of Taiwan]{.underline}.
Articles in state-run news outlets and on popular websites have likewise
urged China to act swiftly. And if [public opinion polls are to be
believed, the Chinese people agree that the time has come to resolve the
Taiwan issue once and for all]{.underline}. According to a survey by the
state-run Global Times, [70 percent of mainlanders strongly support
using force to unify Taiwan with the mainland, and 37 percent think it
would be best if the war occurred in **three to five
years.**]{.underline}

The Chinese analysts and officials I have spoken to have revealed
similar sentiments. Even [moderate voices have admitted that not only
are calls for armed unification proliferating within the CCP but also
they themselves have recommended military action to senior Chinese
leadership]{.underline}. Others in Beijing dismiss concerns about a
Chinese invasion as overblown, but in the same breath, they acknowledge
that [Xi is surrounded by military advisers who tell him with confidence
that China can now regain Taiwan by force at an acceptable
cost.]{.underline}

BATTLE READY

Unless the United States or Taiwan moves first to alter the status quo,
Xi will likely consider initiating armed unification only if he is
confident that his military can successfully gain control of the island.
Can it?

The answer is a matter of debate, and it depends on what it would take
to compel Taiwan's capitulation. [Beijing is preparing for four main
campaigns that its military planners believe could be necessary to take
control of the island. The first consists of joint PLA missile and
airstrikes to disarm Taiwanese targets---initially military and
government, then civilian---and thereby force Taipei's submission to
Chinese demands. The second is a blockade operation in which China would
attempt to cut the island off from the outside world with everything
from naval raids to cyberattacks. The third involves missile and
airstrikes against U.S. forces deployed nearby, with the aim of making
it difficult for the United States to come to Taiwan's aid in the
initial stages of the conflict. The fourth and final campaign is an
island landing effort in which China would launch an amphibious assault
on Taiwan]{.underline}---perhaps taking its offshore islands first as
part of a phased invasion or carpet bombing them as the navy, the army,
and the air force focused on Taiwan proper.

Among defense experts, there is little debate about China's ability to
pull off the first three of these campaigns---the joint strike, the
blockade, and the counterintervention mission. Neither U.S. efforts to
make its regional bases more resilient nor Taiwanese missile defense
systems are any match for China's ballistic and cruise missiles, which
are the most advanced in the world. China could quickly destroy Taiwan's
key infrastructure, block its oil imports, and cut off its Internet
access---and sustain such a blockade indefinitely. According to Lonnie
Henley, a retired U.S. intelligence officer and China specialist, "U.S.
forces could probably push through a trickle of relief supplies, but not
much more." And because China has such a sophisticated air defense
system, the United States would have little hope of regaining air or
naval superiority by attacking Chinese missile transporters, fighters,
or ships.

But China's fourth and final campaign---an amphibious assault on the
island itself---is far from guaranteed to succeed. According to a 2020
U.S. Department of Defense report, "China continues to build
capabilities that would contribute to a full-scale invasion," but "an
attempt to invade Taiwan would likely strain China's armed forces and
invite international intervention." The then commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, Philip Davidson, said in March that China will
have the ability to successfully invade Taiwan in six years. Other
observers think it will take longer, perhaps until around 2030 or 2035.

The voices in Beijing arguing that it is time to use newfound military
capabilities against Taiwan have grown louder.

What everyone agrees is that Ch[ina has made significant strides in its
ability to conduct joint operations in recent years and that the United
States needs adequate warning to mount a successful defense. As Beijing
hones its spoofing and jamming technologies, it may be able to scramble
U.S. early warning systems and thereby keep U.S. forces in the dark in
the early hours of an attack.]{.underline} Xi's military reforms have
improved China's cyberwarfare and electronic warfare capabilities, which
could be trained on civilian, as well as military, targets. As Dan
Coats, then the U.S. director of national intelligence, testified in
2019, [Beijing is capable of **offensive cyberattacks** against the
United States that would cause "localized, temporary disruptive effects
on critical infrastructure]{.underline}." China's offensive weaponry,
including ballistic and cruise missiles, could also destroy U.S. bases
in the western Pacific in a matter of days.

In light of these enhanced capabilities, many U[.S. experts worry that
China could take control of Taiwan before the United States even had a
chance to react. Recent war games conducted by the Pentagon and the RAND
Corporation have shown that a military clash between the United States
and China over Taiwan would likely result in a U.S. defeat]{.underline},
with China completing an all-out invasion in just days or weeks.

Ultimately, on the question of whether China will use force, [Chinese
leaders' perceptions of their chances of victory will matter more than
their actual chances of victory.]{.underline} For that reason, it [is
bad news that Chinese analysts and officials increasingly express
confidence that the PLA is well prepared for a military confrontation
with the United States over Taiwan.]{.underline} Although Chinese
strategists acknowledge the United States' general military superiority,
many have come to believe that because China is closer to Taiwan and
cares about it more, the local balance of power tips in Beijing's favor.

As U.S.-Chinese tensions have risen, China's state-sponsored media
outlets have grown more vocal in their praise for the country's military
capabilities. In April, the Global Times described an unnamed military
expert saying that "the PLA exercises are not only warnings, but also
show real capabilities and pragmatically practicing reunifying the
island if it comes to that[." If China chooses to invade, the analyst
added, the Taiwanese military "won't stand a chance."]{.underline}

GO FAST, GO SLOW

[Once China has the military capabilities to finally solve its Taiwan
problem, Xi could find it politically untenable not to do so, given the
heightened nationalism of both the CCP and the public]{.underline}. At
this point, [Beijing will likely work its way up to a large-scale
military campaign, beginning with "gray zone" tactics, such as increased
air and naval patrols, and continuing on to coercive diplomacy aimed at
forcing Taipei to negotiate a political resolution]{.underline}.

Psychological warfare will also be part of Beijing's playbook. Chinese
exercises around Taiwan not only help train the PLA but also wear down
Taiwan's military and demonstrate to the world that the United States
cannot protect the island. The PLA wants to make its presence in the
Taiwan Strait routine. The more common its activities there become, the
harder it will be for the United States to determine when a Chinese
attack is imminent, making it easier for the PLA to present the world
with a fait accompli.

At the same time that it ramps up its military activities in the strait,
China will continue its broader diplomatic campaign to eliminate
international constraints on its ability to use force, privileging
economic rights over political ones in its relations with other
countries and within international bodies, downplaying human rights,
and, above all, promoting the norms of sovereignty and noninterference
in internal affairs. Its goal is to create the narrative that any use of
force against Taiwan would be defensive and justified given Taipei's and
Washington's provocations. All these coercive and diplomatic efforts
will move China closer to unification, but they won't get it all the way
there. Taiwan is not some unoccupied atoll in the South China Sea that
China can successfully claim so long as other countries do not respond
militarily. China needs Taiwan's complete capitulation, and that will
likely require a significant show of force.

If Beijing decides to initiate a campaign to forcibly bring Taiwan under
Chinese sovereignty, it will try to calibrate its actions to discourage
U.S. intervention. It might, for example, begin with low-cost military
options, such as joint missile and airstrikes, and only escalate to a
blockade, a seizure of offshore islands, and, finally, a full-blown
invasion if its earlier actions fail to compel Taiwan to capitulate.
Conducted slowly over the course of many months, such a gradual approach
to armed unification would make it difficult for the United States to
mount a strong response, especially if U.S. allies and partners in the
region wish to avoid a war at all costs. A gradual, coercive approach
would also force Washington to initiate direct hostilities between the
two powers. And if China has not fired a shot at U.S. forces, the United
States would find it harder to make the case at home and in Asian
capitals for a U.S. military intervention to turn back a slow-motion
Chinese invasion. An incremental approach would have domestic political
benefits for Beijing, as well. If China received more international
pushback than expected or became embroiled in a campaign against the
United States that started to go badly, it would have more opportunities
to pull back and claim "mission accomplished."

But China could decide to escalate much more rapidly if it concluded
that the United States was likely to intervene militarily regardless of
whether Beijing moved swiftly or gradually. Chinese military strategists
believe that if they give the United States time to mobilize and amass
firepower in the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, China's chances of
victory will decrease substantially. As a result, they could decide to
preemptively hit U.S. bases in the region, crippling Washington's
ability to respond.

In other words[, **U.S. deterrence**---to the extent that it is based on
a credible threat to intervene militarily to protect Taiwan---could
actually **incentivize an attack on U.S. forces** once Beijing has
decided to act. The more credible the American threat to intervene, the
more likely China would be to hit U.S. forces in the region in its
opening salvo.]{.underline} But if [China thought the United States
might stay out of the conflict, it would decline to attack U.S. forces
in the region, since doing so would inevitably bring the United States
into the war.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan war is definite -- assumes possibilities of economic isolationism

WISHFUL THINKING

What might dissuade Xi from pursuing armed unification, if not U.S.
military might? [Most Western analysts believe that Xi's devotion to his
signature plan to achieve the "Chinese dream" of "national
rejuvenation," which requires him to maintain economic growth and
improve China's international standing, will deter him from using
military force and risking derailing his agenda]{.underline}. They
[argue that the economic costs of a military campaign against Taiwan
would be too high]{.underline}, that China would be left completely
isolated internationally, and that Chinese occupation of the island
would tie up Beijing for decades to come.

But these [arguments about the cost of armed unification are based more
on American projections and wishful thinking than on fact. A protracted,
high-intensity conflict would indeed be costly for China, but Chinese
war planners have set out to avoid this scenari]{.underline}o; China is
unlikely to attack Taiwan unless it is confident that it can achieve a
quick victory, ideally before the United States can even respond.

Even if China found itself in a protracted war with the United States,
however, [Chinese leaders may believe they have social and economic
advantages that would enable them to outlast the Americans. They see the
Chinese people as more willing to make sacrifices for the cause of
Taiwan than the American people.]{.underline} Some argue, too, that
[China's large domestic market makes it less reliant on international
trade than many other countries]{.underline}. (The more China
economically decouples from the United States and the closer it gets to
technological self-sufficiency, the greater this advantage will be.)
[Chinese leaders could also take comfort in their ability to quickly
transition to an industrial wartime footing.]{.underline} The United
States has no such ability to rapidly produce military equipment.

International isolation and coordinated punishment of Beijing might seem
like a greater threat to Xi's great Chinese experiment. Eight of China's
top ten trading partners are democracies, and nearly 60 percent of
China's exports go to the United States and its allies. If these
countries responded to a Chinese assault on Taiwan by severing trade
ties with China, the economic costs could threaten the developmental
components of Xi's rejuvenation plan.

[Once China has the military capabilities to solve its Taiwan problem,
Xi could find it politically untenable not to do so.]{.underline}

But [Chinese leaders have good reason to suspect that international
isolation and opprobrium would be relatively mild]{.underline}. [When
China began to cultivate strategic partnerships in the mid-1990s, it
required other countries and organizations, including the European
Union, to sign long-term agreements to prioritize these relationships
and proactively manage any tensions or disruptions]{.underline}. All
these agreements mention trade, investment, economic cooperation, and
working together in the United Nations. Most include provisions in
support of Beijing's position on Taiwan. (Since 1996, China has
convinced more than a dozen countries to switch their diplomatic
recognition to Beijing, leaving Taiwan with only 15 remaining allies.)
In other words, [many of China's most important trading partners have
already sent a strong signal that they will not let Taiwan derail their
relationships with Beijing.]{.underline}

Whether compelling airlines to take Taiwan off their maps or pressuring
Paramount Pictures to remove the Taiwanese flag from the Top Gun hero
Maverick's jacket, [China has largely succeeded in convincing many
countries that Taiwan is an internal matter that they should stay out
of.]{.underline} [Australia has been cautious about expanding its
military cooperation with the United States and reluctant even to
consider joint contingency planning over Taiwan]{.underline} (although
the tide seems to be shifting in Canberra). Opinion polls show that most
[Europeans value their economic ties with China and the United States
roughly the same and don't want to be caught in the middle]{.underline}.
[Southeast Asia feels similarly,]{.underline} with polls showing that
the majority of policymakers and thought leaders from member states of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations believe the best approach to
U.S.-Chinese sparring is for the association to "enhance its own
resilience and unity to fend off their pressures." One [South Korean
official]{.underline} put it more memorably in an interview with The
Atlantic, [comparing the need to pick sides in the U.S.-Chinese dispute
to "asking a child whether you like your dad or your mom."]{.underline}
Such attitudes suggest that the United States would struggle to convince
its allies to isolate China. And if the international reaction to
Beijing's crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang is any indication, the
most China can expect after an invasion of Taiwan are some symbolic
sanctions and words of criticism.

The risk that a bloody insurgency in Taiwan will drag on for years and
drain Beijing of resources is no more of a deterrent---and the idea that
it would be says more about the United States' scars from Afghanistan
and Iraq than about likely scenarios for Taiwan. The PLA's military
textbooks assume the need for a significant campaign to consolidate
power after its troops have landed and broken through Taiwan's coastal
defenses, but they do not express much concern about it. This may be
because although the PLA has not fought a war since 1979, China has
ample experience with internal repression and dedicates more resources
to that mission than to its military. The People's Armed Police boasts
at least 1.5 million members, whose primary mission is suppressing
opposition. [Compared with the military task of invading and seizing
Taiwan in the first place, occupying it probably looks like a piece of
cake.]{.underline}

For all these reasons, Xi [may believe he can regain control of Taiwan
without jeopardizing his Chinese dream. It is telling that in the flood
of commentary on Taiwan that has come out of China in recent months, few
articles have mentioned the costs of war or the potential reaction from
the international community]{.underline}. As one retired high-level
military officer explained to me recently, [China's main concern isn't
the costs; it's sovereignty. Chinese leaders will always fight for what
is theirs.]{.underline} And if China defeats the United States along the
way, it will become the new dominant power in the Asia-Pacific. The
prospects are tantalizing. The worst-case scenario, moreover, is that
the United States reacts more quickly and effectively than expected,
forcing China to declare victory after limited gains and go home.
Beijing would live to capture Taiwan another day.

#### Taiwan -- half cut because I am not sure what its use is

[Of all the intractable issues that could spark a hot war between the
United States and China, **Taiwan is at the very top of the
lis**t]{.underline}. And the potential [geopolitical consequences of
such a war would be profound. Taiwan---"]{.underline}an unsinkable
aircraft carrier and submarine tender," as U.S. Army General Douglas
MacArthur once described it---[has important, often underappreciated
military value as a gateway to the Philippine Sea, a vital theater for
defending Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea from possible Chinese
coercion or attack]{.underline}. There is no guarantee that China would
win a war for the island---or that such a conflict wouldn't drag on for
years and weaken China. But [if Beijing gained control of Taiwan and
based military assets there, China's military position would improve
markedly]{.underline}.

Beijing's [ocean surveillance assets and submarines,]{.underline} in
particular, [could make control of Taiwan a substantial boon to Chinese
military power. Even without any major technological or military leaps,
possession of the island would improve China's ability to impede U.S.
naval]{.underline} [and air operations in the Philippine Sea and thereby
limit the United States' ability to defend its Asian
allies]{.underline}. And if, [in the future, Beijing were to develop a
large fleet of quiet nuclear attack submarines and ballistic missile
submarines, basing them on Taiwan would enable China to threaten
Northeast Asian shipping lanes]{.underline} [and strengthen its
sea-based nuclear forces.]{.underline}

Clearly, the [island's military value bolsters the argument for keeping
Taiwan out of China's grasp.]{.underline} The strength of that case,
however, depends on several factors, including whether one assumes that
China would pursue additional territorial expansion after occupying
Taiwan and make the long-term military and technological investments
needed to take full advantage of the island. It also depends on the
broader course of U.S. China policy. Washington could remain committed
to its current approach of containing the expansion of Chinese power
through a combination of political commitments to U.S. partners and
allies in Asia and a significant forward military presence. Or it might
adopt a more flexible policy that retains commitments only to core
treaty allies and reduces forward deployed forces. Or it might reduce
all such commitments as part of a more restrained approach. Regardless
of which of these three strategies the United States pursues, however,
Chinese control of Taiwan would limit the U.S. military's ability to
operate in the Pacific and would potentially threaten U.S. interests
there.

But the issue is not just that Taiwan's tremendous military value poses
problems for any U.S. grand strategy. It is that no matter what
Washington does---whether it attempts to keep Taiwan out of Chinese
hands or not---it will be forced to run risks and incur costs in its
standoff with Beijing. As the place where all the dilemmas of U.S.
policy toward China collide, Taiwan presents one of the toughest and
most dangerous problems in the world. Simply put, Washington has few
good options there and a great many bad ones that could court calamity.

TAIWAN IN THE BALANCE

[A Chinese assault on Taiwan could shift the military balance of power
in Asia in any number of ways. If China were to take the island swiftly
and easily, many of its military assets geared toward a Taiwan campaign
might be freed up to pursue other military objectives. China might also
be able to assimilate Taiwan's strategic resources, such as its military
equipment, personnel, and semiconductor industry, all of which would
bolster Beijing's military power.]{.underline} But [if China were to
find itself bogged down]{.underline} in a prolonged conquest or
occupation of Taiwan, [the attempt at forced unification might become a
significant drag on Beijing's might.]{.underline}

[Any campaign that delivers Taiwan to China]{.underline}, however,
[would allow Beijing to base important military hardware there---in
particular, underwater surveillance devices and submarines, along with
associated air and coastal defense assets.]{.underline} Stationed in
Taiwan, these [assets would do more than simply extend China's reach
eastward by the length of the Taiwan Strait, as would be the case if
China based missiles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, or other
weapons systems on the island]{.underline}. Underwater surveillance and
[submarines, by contrast, would improve Beijing's ability to impede U.S.
operations in the Philippine Sea]{.underline}, an area that would be of
vital importance in many possible future conflict scenarios involving
China.

The most likely scenarios revolve around [the United States defending
its allies along the so-called first island chain off the Asian
mainland,]{.underline} which starts north of Japan and runs southwest
through Taiwan and the Philippines before curling up toward Vietnam. For
example, [U.S. naval operations in these waters would be essential to
protecting Japan against potential Chinese threats in the East China Sea
and at the southern end of the Ryukyu Islands.]{.underline} Such U.S.
operations would [also be important in most scenarios for defending the
Philippines, and for any scenario that might lead to U.S. strikes on the
Chinese mainland]{.underline}, such as a major conflagration on the
Korean Peninsula. [U.S. naval operations in the Philippine Sea will
become even more important as China's growing missile capabilities
render land-based aircraft and their regional bases increasingly
vulnerable]{.underline}, forcing the United States to rely more heavily
on aircraft and missiles launched from ships.

[If a war in the Pacific were to break out today, China's ability to
conduct effective over-the-horizon attacks---that is, attacks targeting
U.S. ships at distances that exceed the line of sight to the
horizon---would be more limited than commonly supposed]{.underline}.
[China might be able to target forward-deployed U.S. aircraft carriers
and other ships in a first strike that commences a war. But once a
conflict is underway, China's best surveillance assets---large
radars]{.underline} located on the mainland that allow China to "see"
over the horizon---[are likely to be quickly destroyed. The same is true
of Chinese surveillance aircraft or ships in the vicinity of U.S. naval
forces]{.underline}.

[Chinese satellites would be unlikely to make up for these
losses.]{.underline} Using techniques the United States honed during the
Cold War, [U.S. naval forces would probably be able to control their own
radar and communications signatures and thereby avoid detection by
Chinese satellites that listen for electronic emissions]{.underline}.
[Without intelligence from these specialized signal-collecting assets,
China's imaging satellites would be left to randomly search vast swaths
of ocean for U.S. forces.]{.underline} Under these conditions[, U.S.
forces operating in the Philippine Sea would face real but tolerable
risks of long-range attacks, and U.S. leaders probably would not feel
immediate pressure to escalate the conflict by attacking Chinese
satellites]{.underline}.

[If China were to wrest control of Taiwan]{.underline}, however, the
situation would look quite different. [China could place underwater
microphones called hydrophones in the waters off the island's east
coast, which are much deeper than the waters Beijing currently controls
inside the first island chain]{.underline}. Placed [at the appropriate
depth, these specialized sensors could listen outward and detect the
low-frequency sounds of U.S. surface ships thousands of miles
away,]{.underline} [enabling China to more precisely locate them with
satellites and target them with missiles]{.underline}. (U.S. submarines
are too quiet for these hydrophones to detect.) Such [capabilities could
force the United States to restrict its surface ships to areas outside
the range of the hydrophones]{.underline}---[or else carry out risky and
**escalatory attacks** on Chinese satellites]{.underline}. Neither of
these options is appealing.

Washington has few good options on Taiwan and a great many bad ones that
could court calamity.

Chinese hydrophones off Taiwan would be difficult for the United States
to destroy. Only highly specialized submarines or unmanned underwater
vehicles could disable them, and China would be able to defend them with
a variety of means, including mines. Even if the United States did
manage to damage China's hydrophone cables, Chinese repair ships could
mend them under the cover of air defenses China could deploy on the
island.

The best hope for disrupting Chinese hydrophone surveillance would be to
attack the vulnerable processing stations where the data comes ashore
via fiber-optic cables. But those stations could prove hard to find. The
cables can be buried on land as well as under the sea, and nothing
distinguishes the buildings where data processing is done from similar
nondescript military buildings. The range of possible U.S. targets could
include hundreds of individual structures inside multiple well-defended
military locations across Taiwan.

Control of Taiwan would do more than enhance Chinese ocean surveillance
capabilities, however. It would also give China an advantage in
submarine warfare. With Taiwan in friendly hands, the United States can
defend against Chinese attack submarines by placing underwater sensors
in key locations to pick up the sounds the submarines emit. The United
States likely deploys such upward-facing hydrophones---for listening at
shorter distances---along the bottom of narrow chokepoints at the
entrances to the Philippine Sea, including in the gaps between the
Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands, and Taiwan. At such close ranges, these
instruments can briefly detect even the quietest submarines, allowing
U.S. air and surface assets to trail them. During a crisis, that could
prevent Chinese submarines from getting a "free shot" at U.S. ships in
the early stages of a war, when forward-deployed U.S. naval assets would
be at their most vulnerable.

If China were to gain control of Taiwan, however, it would be able to
base submarines and supporting air and coastal defenses on the island.
Chinese submarines would then be able to slip from their pens in
Taiwan's eastern deep-water ports directly into the Philippine Sea,
bypassing the chokepoints where U.S. hydrophones would be listening.
Chinese defenses on Taiwan would also prevent the United States and its
allies from using their best tools for trailing submarines---maritime
patrol aircraft and helicopter-equipped ships---near the island, making
it much easier for Chinese submarines to strike first in a crisis and
reducing their attrition rate in a war. Control of Taiwan would have the
added advantage of reducing the distance between Chinese submarine bases
and their patrol areas from an average of 670 nautical miles to zero,
enabling China to operate more submarines at any given time and carry
out more attacks against U.S. forces. Chinese submarines could also make
use of the more precise targeting data collected by hydrophones and
satellites, dramatically improving their effectiveness against U.S.
surface ships.

UNDER THE SEA

Over time, unification with Taiwan could offer China even greater
military advantages if it were to invest in a fleet of much quieter
advanced nuclear attack and ballistic missile submarines. Operated from
Taiwan's east coast, these submarines would strengthen China's nuclear
deterrent and allow it to threaten Northeast Asian shipping and naval
routes in the event of a war.

Currently, China's submarine force is poorly equipped for a campaign
against the oil and maritime trade of U.S. allies. Global shipping has
traditionally proved resilient in the face of such threats because it is
possible to reroute vessels outside the range of hostile forces. Even
the closure of the Suez Canal between 1967 and 1975 did not paralyze
global trade, since ships were instead able to go around the Cape of
Good Hope, albeit at some additional cost. This resiliency means that
Beijing would have to target shipping routes as they migrated north or
west across the Pacific Ocean, likely near ports in Northeast Asia. But
most of China's current attack submarines are low-endurance
diesel-electric boats that would struggle to operate at such distances,
while its few longer-endurance nuclear-powered submarines are noisy and
thus vulnerable to detection by U.S. outward-facing hydrophones that
could be deployed along the so-called second island chain, which
stretches southeast from Japan through the Northern Mariana Islands and
past Guam.

Similarly, China's current crop of ballistic missile submarines do
little to strengthen China's nuclear deterrent. The ballistic missiles
they carry can at best target Alaska and the northwest corner of the
United States when launched within the first island chain. And because
the submarines are vulnerable to detection, they would struggle to reach
open ocean areas where they could threaten the rest of the United
States.

Seizing Taiwan would offer Beijing the kind of military option that
previous great powers found very useful.

Even a future Chinese fleet of much quieter advanced nuclear attack or
ballistic missile submarines capable of evading outward-facing
hydrophones along the second island chain would still have to pass over
U.S. upward-facing hydrophones nestled at the exits to the first island
chain. These barriers would enable the United States to impose
substantial losses on Chinese advanced nuclear attack submarines going
to and from Northeast Asian shipping lanes and greatly impede the
missions of Chinese ballistic missile submarines, of which there would
almost certainly be fewer.

But if it were to acquire Taiwan, China would be able to avoid U.S.
hydrophones along the first island chain, unlocking the military
potential of quieter submarines. These vessels would have direct access
to the Philippine Sea and the protection of Chinese air and coastal
defenses, which would keep trailing U.S. ships and aircraft at bay. A
fleet of quiet nuclear attack submarines deployed from Taiwan would also
have the endurance for a campaign against Northeast Asian shipping
lanes. And a fleet of quiet ballistic missile submarines with access to
the open ocean would enable China to more credibly threaten the
continental United States with a sea-launched nuclear attack.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether China can master more advanced
quieting techniques or solve a number of problems that have plagued its
nuclear-powered submarines. And the importance of the anti-shipping and
sea-based nuclear capabilities is open for debate, since their relative
impact will depend on what other capabilities China does or doesn't
develop and on what strategic goals China pursues in the future. Still,
the behavior of past great powers is instructive. Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union both invested heavily in attack submarines, and the latter
made a similar investment in ballistic missile submarines. The
democratic adversaries of those countries felt deeply threatened by
these undersea capabilities and mounted enormous efforts to neutralize
them. A Chinese seizure of Taiwan would thus offer Beijing the kind of
military option that previous great powers found very useful.

NO GOOD OPTIONS

A fuller understanding of Taiwan's military value clearly bolsters the
argument in favor of keeping the island in friendly hands. Yet just how
decisive that argument should be depends, in part, on what overall
strategy the United States pursues in Asia. And whatever approach
Washington adopts, it will have to contend with challenges and dilemmas
stemming from the military advantages that Taiwan has the potential to
confer on whoever controls it.

If the United States maintains its current strategy of containing China,
retaining its network of alliances and forward military presence in
Asia, defending Taiwan could be extremely costly. After all, the
island's military value gives China a strong motive for seeking
unification, beyond the nationalist impulses most commonly cited.
Deterring Beijing would therefore probably require abandoning the
long-standing U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity about whether
Washington would come to the island's defense in favor of a
crystal-clear commitment of military support.

But ending strategic ambiguity could provoke the very crisis the policy
is designed to prevent. It would almost certainly heighten pressures for
an arms race between the United States and China in anticipation of a
conflict, intensifying the already dangerous competition between the two
powers. And even if a policy of strategic clarity were successful in
deterring a Chinese attempt to take Taiwan, it would likely spur China
to compensate for its military disadvantages in some other way, further
heightening tensions.

Alternatively, the United States might pursue a more flexible security
perimeter that eliminates its commitment to Taiwan while still retaining
its treaty alliances and some forward-deployed military forces in Asia.
Such an approach would reduce the chance of a conflict over Taiwan, but
it would carry other military costs, again owing to the island's
military value. U.S. forces would need to conduct their missions in an
arena made much more dangerous by Chinese submarines and hydrophones
deployed off the east coast of Taiwan. As a result, the United States
might need to develop decoys to deceive Chinese sensors, devise ways to
operate outside their normal range, or prepare to cut the cables that
connect these sensors to onshore processing centers in the event of war.
Washington would almost certainly want to ramp up its efforts to disrupt
Chinese satellites.

Should the United States take this approach, reassuring U.S. allies
would become a much more arduous task. Precisely because control of
Taiwan would grant Beijing significant military advantages, Japan, the
Philippines, and South Korea would likely demand strong demonstrations
of a continuing U.S. commitment. Japan, in particular, would be inclined
to worry that a diminished U.S. ability to operate on the surface of the
Philippine Sea would translate into enhanced Chinese coercion or attack
capability, especially given the proximity of Japan's southernmost
islands to Taiwan.

Over the longer term, U.S. allies in the region would also likely fear
the growing Chinese threat to shipping routes and worry that a stronger
sea-based Chinese nuclear deterrent would reduce the credibility of U.S.
commitments to defend them from attack. Anticipation of these dangers
would almost certainly drive U.S. allies to seek greater reassurance
from the United States in the form of tighter defense pacts, additional
military aid, and more visible U.S. force deployments in the region,
including of nuclear forces on or near allies' territory and perhaps
collaborating with their governments on nuclear planning. East Asia
could come to look much like Europe did in the later stages of the Cold
War, with U.S. allies demanding demonstrations of their U.S. patron's
commitment in the face of doubts about the military balance of power. If
the Cold War is any guide, such steps could themselves heighten the
risks of nuclear escalation in a crisis or a war.

Finally, the United States might pursue a strategy that ends its
commitment to Taiwan and also reduces its military presence in Asia and
other alliance commitments in the region. Such a policy might limit
direct U.S. military support to the defense of Japan or even wind down
all U.S. commitments in East Asia. But even in this case, Taiwan's
potential military value to China would still have the potential to
create dangerous regional dynamics. Worried that some of its islands
might be next, Japan might fight to defend Taiwan, even if the United
States did not. The result might be a major-power war in Asia that could
draw in the United States, willingly or not. Such a war would be
devastating. Yet upsetting the current delicate equilibrium by ceding
this militarily valuable island could make such a war more likely,
reinforcing a core argument in favor of current U.S. grand strategy:
that U.S. alliance commitments and forward military presence exert a
deterring and constraining effect on conflict in the region.

Ultimately, however, Taiwan's unique military value poses problems for
all three U.S. grand strategies. Whether the United States solidifies
its commitment to Taiwan and its allies in Asia or walks them back, in
full or in part, the island's potential to alter the region's military
balance will force Washington to confront difficult tradeoffs, ceding
military maneuverability in the region or else risking an arms race or
even an open conflict with China. Such is the wicked nature of the
problem posed by Taiwan, which sits at the nexus of U.S.-Chinese
relations, geopolitics, and the military balance in Asia. Regardless of
what grand strategy Washington pursues, the island's military value will
present some hazard or exact some price.

### No Taiwan war

#### Beckley and Brands are wrong -- Ukraine reinforces Xi's commitment to the long game which prevents Taiwan war!

**Nathan 22** -- *professor at Columbia polisci, Ph.D., Harvard, MA,
Harvard, BA, Harvard* (Andrew J. Nathan, 6-23-2022, \"Beijing Is Still
Playing the Long Game on Taiwan,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-06-23/beijing-still-playing-long-game-taiwan)//KH

[Concern is growing in Taiwan, in the United States, and among U.S.
allies in Asia that China is preparing to attack Taiwan in the near
future]{.underline}. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee last year, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the commander of the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned that Beijing might attempt to seize
the island in the next six years. Unifying Taiwan with mainland China is
a key element of Chinese President Xi Jinping's "Chinese dream." And as
the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro has argued in these pages,
Xi wants "unification with Taiwan to be part of his personal legacy,"
suggesting that an armed invasion could come before the end of his third
term as secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027 and
almost certainly before the end of his probable fourth term in 2032.

[Putin's war in Ukraine has intensified these concerns. Xi's
announcement just before the Russian invasion of a "no limits"
partnership with Moscow, coupled with his failure to condemn Putin's
actions and the Chinese media's endorsement of Russian propaganda, seem
to signal Beijing's support for Russia's territorial
aggression.]{.underline} Beijing may see a strategic opening now that
U.S. political and military resources are tied up in Europe. Moreover,
Chinese leaders may have interpreted the West's response to the Russian
attack as an indication that the United States will not intervene
militarily to defend a country to which it is not bound by a defense
treaty, especially against a nuclear-armed adversary. As David Sacks of
the Council on Foreign Relations has argued, "Chinese policymakers may
conclude that Russia's nuclear arsenal effectively deterred the United
States, which would be unwilling to go to war with a nuclear power over
Taiwan."

But [fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced. For decades,
China's policy toward Taiwan has been characterized by strategic
patience, as has its approach to other territorial claims and
disputes---from India to the South China Sea.]{.underline} Far from
spurring China to jettison this approach in favor of an imminent
military assault on Taiwan, [the war in Ukraine will reinforce Beijing's
commitment to playing the long game. The price Moscow has paid, both
militarily and in the form of international isolation, is but a fraction
of what China could expect if it were to attempt to take Taiwan by
force]{.underline}. [Better to wait patiently for Taiwan's eventual
surrender]{.underline}, as Beijing sees it, than to strike now and risk
winning the island at too high a cost---or losing it forever.

IMPENDING ATTACK?

Fear that China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin
invaded Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a
2021 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests.

In 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan
to normalize relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of
winning over Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically
isolated, militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on
the mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party.

But these efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against
unification in Taiwanese public opinion and politics. According to
opinion polls, the share of Taiwanese voters favoring unification fell
from 28 percent in 1999 to less than two percent in 2022. [An
overwhelming majority favor "maintaining the status quo," which in the
language of Taiwanese politics means sustaining autonomy without
formally declaring independence]{.underline}. Since 2016, the
anti-unification Democratic Progressive Party has controlled both the
presidency and the legislature, and it looks well positioned to win the
next set of national elections in 2024.

[Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced.]{.underline}

These trends have prompted China to adopt a more threatening posture
toward Taiwan. Beijing has stepped up measures to isolate the island
diplomatically, slowed imports and the tourist trade, trained the
Chinese military to conduct the complicated joint operations necessary
for a cross-strait invasion, and conducted frequent probes of Taiwan's
air defense identification zone. China has also developed what the
Pentagon calls "anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including
long-range precision missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship
ballistic missiles, cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to
hold at bay a U.S. defense of Taiwan.

These moves have fed speculation that China is building up to a
full-scale attack. In addition to Xi's desire to secure his legacy, [the
shifting balance of power between China and the United States is often
cited by U.S. analysts as a possible motivation for Xi.]{.underline}
[The scholars Michael **Beckley and** Hal **Brands**, for instance, have
suggested that China may attack in the near term because it has reached
the peak of its national strength---and China's leaders know
it]{.underline}. China is looking at a period of decline caused by a
combination of unsustainable debt, rising labor costs, an aging
population, declining productivity, and a critical water shortage.
Meanwhile, the United States and Taiwan have recently started to
readjust their military postures to counter the asymmetric threat China
poses. The Biden administration is pulling Japan and South Korea
together around a commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait," and
Western businesses are gradually moving their production sites out of
China because of rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in
the Chinese market, and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation
gathers steam, the West's economic incentives to avoid war with China
will diminish. By this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its
adversaries are ready.

WAITING GAME

T[he facts on which such forecasts are based are not wrong, but they are
incomplete. A fuller set of facts suggests that China is still pursuing
a strategy of strategic patience]{.underline} when it comes to Taiwan.
[First, Chinese leaders---rightly or wrongly---seem confident that they
can handle their own problems better than the West can handle its
problems]{.underline}. They [don't deny the challenges that Beckley and
Brands highlight, but they believe the West is in decline]{.underline},
hobbled [by ill-managed and slow-growing economies, social divisions,
and weak political leaders]{.underline}. However, [Chinese strategists
do not seem to believe that China has yet reached a favorable power
balance with the West]{.underline}. As Yan Xuetong, dean of the
Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, has argued,
"[China's global reach still has its limits. Despite being a major
power, China also thinks of itself as a developing country---and rightly
so, considering that its GDP per capita remains far behind those of
advanced economies]{.underline}."

[Beijing can afford to wait for power in the Western Pacific to tip
decisively in its favor. When Washington comes to understand that the
cost of defending Taiwan is beyond its means, and Taiwanese officials
realize that Washington no longer has the appetite for a clash with
China, Taiwan will pragmatically negotiate an arrangement that Beijing
can accept.]{.underline} In the meantime, China needs only to deter
Taipei and Washington from attempting to lock in formal Taiwanese
independence[. Beijing's shows of force are not precursors of an
imminent attack, therefore, but measures intended to buy
time]{.underline} for history to take its course.

Second, contrary to the common portrayal of China as itching for war,
[Beijing has demonstrated strategic patience in pursuit of its other
goals. A good example is Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea,
where China has built and militarized seven sand islands without
triggering a war with the United States or rival territorial
claimants]{.underline}. It did so by building only on landforms it
already controlled, claiming all along that it wasn't doing what it was
doing. The [rival territorial claimants were too weak to confront China,
while the United States lacked a justification for doing so because it
has no territorial claims where China was building]{.underline}. Beijing
restricted access to but refrained from seizing a landform it contests
with the sole U.S. treaty ally involved in these disputes---the
Philippines---which in any case lacked an appetite to invoke its
alliance with Washington by moving militarily to defend itself.

The conflict in Ukraine is reminding Xi that war is unpredictable and
rule over a resisting population is costly.

[China likewise changed the strategic status quo without triggering an
armed conflict over the contested Senkaku Islands]{.underline}, known in
China as the Diaoyu Islands, [by escalating from an occasional maritime
presence in Japanese waters to a permanent one]{.underline},
supplementing its naval forces with less confrontational coast guard,
maritime militia, and fishing vessels. [Beijing followed a similar
playbook in the contested Ladakh region of India, where Chinese troops
gradually advanced their positions and established a series of new lines
of control]{.underline} with only one confirmed outbreak of shooting
that was quickly contained.

[China has invested in ostensibly civilian port projects across the
Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as foundations for future naval
operations, raising some alarm but no counteraction]{.underline}.
Beijing has also used its economic and diplomatic influence in Africa,
Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Oceania and its norm-setting
power in international institutions to incentivize governments to align
with China's interests, again generating some alarm but no effective
resistance. [Such diplomatic, economic, and military "**gray zone
tactics"** illustrate that China's strategic behavior is geared toward
the long term rather than the short term, moving from no presence to
sustained presence in a host of arenas without generating substantial
pushback, much less armed conflict (with the exception of the fighting
in Ladakh]{.underline}). That same strategic caution has so far been
evident in China's policy toward Taiwan, where Beijing has dialed up
tension and deterred a Taiwanese drive for independence without
precipitating a crisis.

Finally, [the lesson Xi is likely drawing from Putin's war in Ukraine is
not that territorial aggression would go unpunished militarily by the
West but that it would be both difficult and costly.]{.underline} There
is no reason to believe that Xi is surrounded, as Putin seems to be, by
yes men who will tell him that a war over Taiwan can be easily won.
[Even if he is, however, the grinding conflict in Ukraine is reminding
him that war is unpredictable and rule over a resisting population is
costly. The amphibious operation China would need to undertake to seize
Taiwan would be far more difficult than the land invasion Russia has
carried out in Ukraine]{.underline}. Xi has been reforming the Chinese
military's command structure and ramping up training for such an
operation, but Chinese forces remain untested in actual combat
operations. Meanwhile, [the chances that the United States would
intervene to defend Taiwan have increased as anti-Chinese sentiment has
risen in the United States and Europe]{.underline}---and after U.S.
President Joe Biden remarked last month that defending Taiwan is "the
commitment we made."

[Even if Beijing could win a war over Taiwan, it is unclear that it
could win what would come next.]{.underline} As painful as Russia's
isolation from Western economies has been for Moscow, the [postwar
scenario for the Chinese economy would be even more damaging. China
imports 70 percent of its oil and 31 percent of its natural gas; it is
the world's largest coal producer but still needs to import
more.]{.underline} Although it is striving for food self-sufficiency,
[China is the world's largest importer of food,]{.underline} especially
corn, meat, seafood, and soybeans. Some of these [energy and food
imports come from Russia, but many come from countries that would
sanction China if it invaded Taiwan.]{.underline} And even if they did
not, [China's navy doesn't have the global reach to defend the shipping
routes across which these and many other vital commodities flow. Any war
over Taiwan, even a successful one for Beijing, would deal a devastating
blow to the Chinese economy, creating conditions that would threaten
domestic political stability]{.underline} and usher in the failure, not
the realization, of the Chinese dream.

FIGHTING PATIENCE WITH PATIENCE

None of this is reason for American or Taiwanese complacency. China is
following the dictum of the ancient strategist Sun-tzu: "To subdue the
enemy without fighting is the acme of skill." If Beijing eventually
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it will fatally undermine Washington's
credibility with its Asian---and even its European---allies, challenging
Australia, Japan, South Korea, and other countries to either come to
terms with China or prepare to defend themselves without American help.

[The only way to defeat China's Taiwan strategy of strategic patience is
to exercise corresponding patience, continually adapting American and
Taiwanese deterrence as Chinese arms and training present an
ever-changing and ever-growing threat.]{.underline} This is a tall order
for the United States at a time when its share of global GDP has
declined to less than 25 percent (from 40 percent in 1960) and the U.S.
Navy complains that it doesn't have enough ships to perform all the
missions it is charged with. It is an even taller order for an island
that spends only 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense and that has only
recently begun to move away from an unrealistic reliance on expensive
advanced platforms to stave off a Chinese attack and toward a more
realistic "porcupine strategy" involving mines, short-range missiles,
civil defense, and guerrilla resistance. But if a prolonged standoff in
the Taiwan Strait is the most likely prospect for the future, the side
that that stays in the game the longest is the one that is likely to
come out on top.

### No Russia Rise

#### Ukraine is a case study for Russian military incompetency -- cannot threaten US heg

POWER WITHOUT PURPOSE

One must be careful when drawing large lessons from wars with their own
special features, particularly from a war whose full consequences are
not yet known. [Analysts and military planners are certain to study the
war in Ukraine for many years as an example of the limits to military
power]{.underline}, looking for explanations as to why one of the
strongest and largest armed forces in the world, with a formidable air
force and navy and new equipment and with recent and successful combat
experience, faltered so badly. [Before the invasion, when Russia's
military was compared with Ukraine's smaller and lesser-armed defense
forces, few doubted which side would gain the upper hand. But actual war
is determined by qualitative and human factors, and it was the
Ukrainians who had sharper tactics]{.underline}, brought together by
command structures, from the highest political level to the lowlier
field commanders, that were fit for the purpose.

[Putin's war in Ukraine, then, is foremost a case study in a failure of
supreme command. The way that objectives are set and wars launched by
the commander in chief shapes what follows.]{.underline} Putin's
[mistakes were not unique; they were typical of those made by autocratic
leaders who come to believe their own propaganda.]{.underline} He did
not test his optimistic assumptions about the ease with which he could
achieve victory. He [trusted his armed forces to deliver. He did not
realize that Ukraine was a challenge on a completely different
scale]{.underline} from earlier operations in Chechnya, Georgia, and
Syria. But he also [relied on a rigid and hierarchical command structure
that was unable to absorb and adapt to information from the ground and,
crucially, did not enable Russian units to respond rapidly to changing
circumstances.]{.underline}

The [value of delegated authority and local initiative will be one of
the other key lessons from this war]{.underline}. But [for these
practices to be effective, the military in question must be able to
satisfy four conditions. First, there must be mutual trust between those
at the senior and most junior levels. Those at the highest level of
command must have confidence that their subordinates have the
intelligence and ability to do the right thing in demanding
circumstances]{.underline}, while their subordinates must have
confidence that the high command will provide what backing they can.
Second, [those doing the fighting must have access to the equipment and
supplies they need to keep going. It helped the Ukrainians that they
were using portable antitank and air-defense weapons and were fighting
close to their home bases,]{.underline} but they still needed their
logistical systems to work.

Third, those [providing leadership at the most junior levels of command
need to be of high quality. Under Western guidance, the Ukrainian army
had been developing the sort of noncommissioned officer corps that can
ensure that the basic demands of an army on the move will be
met,]{.underline} from equipment maintenance to actual preparedness to
fight. In practice, even more relevant was that many of [those who
returned to the ranks when Ukraine mobilized were experienced veterans
and had a natural understanding of what needed to be done]{.underline}.

But this leads to the fourth condition. The [ability to act effectively
at any level of command requires a commitment to the mission and an
understanding of its political purpose. These elements were lacking on
the Russian side because of the way Putin launched his war: the enemy
the Russian forces had been led to expect was not the one they
faced]{.underline}, and the Ukrainian population was not, contrary to
what they had been told, inclined to be liberated. [The more futile the
fight, the lower the morale and the weaker the discipline of those
fighting. In these circumstances, local initiative can simply lead to
desertion or looting. By contrast, the Ukrainians were defending their
territory against an enemy intent on destroying their land.]{.underline}
There was [an asymmetry of motivation that influenced the fighting from
the start. Which takes us back to the folly of Putin's original
decision. It is hard to command forces to act in support of a
delusion.]{.underline}

### First strike solves/China war good

#### China's second-strike capabilities fail

[If a war in the Pacific were to break out today, China's ability to
conduct effective over-the-horizon attacks---that is, attacks targeting
U.S. ships at distances that exceed the line of sight to the
horizon---would be more limited than commonly supposed]{.underline}.
[China might be able to target forward-deployed U.S. aircraft carriers
and other ships in a first strike that commences a war. But once a
conflict is underway, China's best surveillance assets---large
radars]{.underline} located on the mainland that allow China to "see"
over the horizon---[are likely to be quickly destroyed. The same is true
of Chinese surveillance aircraft or ships in the vicinity of U.S. naval
forces]{.underline}.

[Chinese satellites would be unlikely to make up for these
losses.]{.underline} Using techniques the United States honed during the
Cold War, [U.S. naval forces would probably be able to control their own
radar and communications signatures and thereby avoid detection by
Chinese satellites that listen for electronic emissions]{.underline}.
[Without intelligence from these specialized signal-collecting assets,
China's imaging satellites would be left to randomly search vast swaths
of ocean for U.S. forces.]{.underline} Under these conditions[, U.S.
forces operating in the Philippine Sea would face real but tolerable
risks of long-range attacks, and U.S. leaders probably would not feel
immediate pressure to escalate the conflict by attacking Chinese
satellites]{.underline}.

### Multipolarity now

#### Oil price fluctuations prove that multipolarity explains a broader range of global power relations than hegemony

Professor of Political Science at Brown University and Director of the
Climate Solutions Lab at the Watson Institute of Public and
International Affairs* (Yaechan, 3-17-2022, \"Webinar Summary -- Partial
Hegemony: Oil Politics and International Order,\" Boston University,
https://www.bu.edu/gdp/2022/03/23/webinar-summary-partial-hegemony-oil-politics-and-international-order/)//KH

On Thursday, March 17, 2022, the Boston University Global Development
Policy Center hosted Professor Jeff Colgan, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Brown University and Director of the Climate
Solutions Lab at the Watson Institute of Public and International
Affairs, to discuss his new book, 'Partial Hegemony: Oil Politics and
International Order', as part of the 2022 Global Economic Governance
Book Talk Series.

In his book, Colgan touches upon a core debate in the international
relations literature on what constitutes international order and why or
how that definition is informed by the distinct change of order in oil
politics [since the Oil Shock in 1973. Colgan finds the change was not
driven by factors commonly considered to be major catalysts for change,
such as existing dominant hegemons or a major global war]{.underline}.
Rather, [it was driven by a group of non-major powers, or the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),]{.underline}
and this fundamentally [changed the initial dominance that Western
powers]{.underline} and their private companies (the so-called Seven
Sisters) [had over the oil industry]{.underline}. In this respect, the
conventional [perception of how politics works, that the hegemon sets up
and sustains international order]{.underline}, particularly following
war, [doesn't hold]{.underline}. In response to this apparent
observational discrepancy between theory and reality, Colgan argues [the
international order should be perceived as a collection of multiple
subsystems, where no single power dominates the entire
system]{.underline}. Hence, [change within subsystems may occur, hinging
on the conditions and power relations unique to each
subsystem.]{.underline}

Before discussing the details of the book, Colgan first underscored the
book's relevance to current affairs. To show the importance of the
book's focus on oil politics, [Colgan addressed Russia's war in Ukraine
and how the presence of oil can explain why some states may be more
inclined to wage war on others]{.underline}, based on his first book,
'Petro-Aggression'. According to Colgan, [petrostates are roughly 50
percent more likely to get into conflict than other nations, as the
presence of oil provides oil money to buy off opposing factions or hire
security services to suppress citizen opposition while funding military
expansion, thereby facilitating the preparation needed for
war]{.underline}. [When such conditions are coupled with leadership that
prefers aggressive foreign policies, the chances of the state becoming
an 'aggressive petrostate' become higher.]{.underline} In light of the
ongoing war, Colgan argued that [this has been the case for Russia under
the leadership of Vladimir Putin.]{.underline}

Beyond the political implications of oil, Colgan also noted oil
[production is still placed at the center of the energy
industry]{.underline}, making it an all the more important topic. As
[energy is the bedrock of the modern economy, disruptions in oil supply
chains could cause serious setbacks to general industry]{.underline}.
Colgan argued it is imperative that the drivers of change are fully
understood to dictate order in the oil industry for a more robust risk
calculation and the establishment of a more desirable blueprint for the
future development path of order within the oil sector. And [through a
detailed analysis in one sector, Colgan argued meaningful implications
can be derived on how subsystems of the international order function and
interact with each other]{.underline}. An accumulation of such research
efforts would then serve as additional evidence of Colgan's argument on
international order and its subsystems.

Colgan then moved on to present empirical details to back the thesis of
the book by first focusing on the oil price volatility before and after
the Oil Shock. [After World War II, the Seven Sisters controlled 85
percent of global oil production, and were so effective in controlling
the oil price volatility that for nearly two decades after the war,
there was no significant fluctuation in oil prices until OPEC countries
turned the tables]{.underline}. [Since then, oil prices have been highly
volatile]{.underline}. Colgan argued that the international community
must pay attention to how the Seven Sisters were able to exert such an
effective influence in the market, why OPEC countries were able to
overturn the situation and what implications this sequence of events has
on the features of the oil industry as a subsystem. In other words, when
is order effective and durable, and when does it change?

Colgan focused on two subsystems within the oil sector to answer these
questions. The first was the oil production subsystem which determines
how much oil is to be produced and where. As oil fields are distributed
around the world, who has sovereignty over which oil fields may be a
strong determinant of oil prices. Another more understudied subsystem,
he argued, is the oil security subsystem which decides how oil field
production may be distributed. The Seven Sisters, backed by the military
support of the US and British governments, would provide protection for
oil fields, occupy production rights for them and retaliate against
those that acted out of the system. Hence, production and price
volatility were kept extremely steady. Colgan argued such a level of
control was possible due to the imperial legacy of Western economies in
Africa and the Middle East, which significantly waned due to the wave of
decolonization in the mid 20th century, culminating in the Oil Shock of
1973. In other words, [decolonization brought about change in the oil
security subsystem, causing the US to lose its hegemony in the oil
sector.]{.underline} Although the legacies of such a past remain in the
present day in looser form of oil-for-security deals, for instance,
between Saudi Arabia and the US, Colgan maintained the link is much
weaker than before.

Colgan argued [these findings carry important theoretical implications
to the study of international order]{.underline}. According to Colgan,
[in contrast to the ongoing debate on whether the US's hegemony is
waning, international order is governed by a 'partial
hegemony]{.underline}.' [The most influential state maintains dominance
in the most fundamental subsystems of the order, such as currency or the
military, but the hegemony is partial, as seen in the oil
subsystems]{.underline}. T[reating order as a monolith leaves scholars
blind]{.underline} to this distinction, while seeing in subsystems
allows for a more accurate analysis.

The Q&A portion of the webinar involved insightful discussions with the
participants, especially regarding how the US can react to the oil
supply chain disruptions in Europe due to the sanctions placed on Russia
from its invasion of Ukraine, given that the US's hegemony in the oil
sector is not absolute under the subsystem perspective. Colgan noted the
clear challenges that the European Union would face in overcoming energy
shortages, as it has been overly reliant on Russian natural gas, while
also noting the challenges the US and international institutions are
facing in increasing production to account for the shortages. Questions
on the carbon reduction trend and its effect on the oil sector were also
asked. Colgan, however, saw that the oil industry will remain robust at
least for the next ten to 20 years, but given the foreseeable reducing
demand for oil, the most cost-efficient producers of oil will remain,
bringing about a wave of change to the oil sector subsystems.

### Cap unsustainable

#### Global capitalism is unsustainable -- energy transition is bunk, global health infrastructure is non-existent, and international economic systems are collapsing

**Zelikow 22** - *Professor of History at the University of Virginia. A
former U.S. diplomat and Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, he
has worked for five presidential administrations* (Philip, July/August

TALK IS CHEAP

In the 30 years since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the
problem of how countries can source, supply, and pay for energy has
become a defining planetary challenge. The main [international response
has been a wide commitment to decarbonization, expressed in
international pledges. But these pledges are a façade]{.underline}. As
the International Energy Agency recently pointed out, most of them are
not underpinned by [substantive policies, and if they were, they would
still not be nearly enough to stop climate change]{.underline}. (Even
Europe, the loudest voice for a green transition, has spent the last
decade becoming more dependent on fossil fuels, particularly from
Russia.) [The world's response to climate change, then, has been the
geopolitical equivalent of a masque]{.underline}: a form of
sixteenth-century aristocratic court entertainment, a dramatic
performance featuring poetry and dumb allegorical shows, usually
culminating in a ceremonial dance joined by the spectators.

Even [the energy transition will not, by itself, stabilize the planet.
It will shift dependence from fossil fuels to an even more pronounced
reliance on certain metals used in green technology.]{.underline} [In
the relevant geology, mining, and mineral processing, China and Russia
are in paramount positions. In the absence of any concerted action, the
world is therefore trending toward addiction, and financial flows, to
those new sources---China above all---in its carbon-free
dreams]{.underline}. The architects of this system have done little to
prevent such addiction.

It might seem that international economic management is a bright spot,
an arena where there has been real action, not just a masque. To some
extent, that's true. In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis,
the main central banks jumped into action. Unlike in 1931, a financial
panic that had earlier started in the United States and then spread to
Europe did not lead to a world-crushing depression; instead, finance
ministries and central banks coordinated to bail each other out. The
G-20 was a genuinely useful forum to consider vital economic issues.

[In the last ten years, however, the institutions for managing global
capitalism have also become more stage than substance.]{.underline} The
[United States is unable to join new trade agreements because of
domestic opposition. Countries across the planet have piled up debt, and
the current international economic system cannot coordinate how to wind
it down or provide necessary relief]{.underline}. The [operation of the
World Trade Organization is coming to a halt, both because it is unable
to modernize its rules and because the United States has deliberately
paralyzed the WTO's dispute settlement]{.underline} system by refusing
to confirm arbiters.

But nowhere has the hollowness of the current world order been more
starkly revealed than [in global health.]{.underline} After the SARS
epidemic of 2003, amid concerns about China's role in informing the rest
of the planet about the outbreak, the [nations of the world
ceremoniously enacted a set of "international health regulations," which
defined the rights and duties of states to prevent and contain
international public health dangers. The outbreak of COVID-19 revealed
that the elaborate provisions for global surveillance and early warnings
were a sham.]{.underline} The pandemic [also showed that the planet's
main public health agency---the World Health Organization---was
weak]{.underline}, and it demonstrated that the world's major powers
were far too self-interested to mount a truly global response. The most
substantial investigation so far of the world's reaction to COVID-19, by
an independent panel with access to the WHO's staff and documents, found
it was "a preventable disaster." As they wrote, "Global political
leadership was absent."

It's a conclusion that is difficult to escape. China's government has
blocked proper investigations into the outbreak's cause and continues to
stonewall the WHO. In his own gesture of theatrical pretense, then U.S.
President Donald Trump moved to pull his country out of the WHO during
the spring of 2020, turning the crisis into a blame game focused on
China, with the organization as an accomplice. Yet the Trump
administration had no alternative agenda for meaningful global action.
Its acclaimed vaccine development program encouraged an "every country
for itself" approach to acquisition and bypassed the challenge of
developing effective therapeutics.

The Biden administration has tried to correct Trump's mistakes. In
2021,with due fanfare, the United States rejoined the WHO. It then
focused on a rhetorically appealing G-20 health security agenda that
called for spending more money on global readiness. But this agenda has
turned out to be impractical in detail and ineffective in its results.
At the October 2021 G-20 summit in Rome, the United States struggled to
get the other countries to agree to even study its proposal.
