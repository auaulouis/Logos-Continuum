[On the one hand, if anything demonstrates the dangers of a world with
nuclear weapons, it's the war in Ukraine. And yet, it's also a
demonstration of why countries want to have them.]{.underline} Russia's
nuclear arsenal is one big reason why it has been able to invade a
neighboring country (a [relatively rare event in today's
world](https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/02/16/putin-ukraine-russia-invasion-war-biden-crisis/))
without facing an international military response. It also seems far
less likely that Russia would have invaded had Ukraine possessed a
nuclear arsenal of its own. Compounding the frustration for Ukrainians
is the fact that the country *did* have nuclear weapons on its territory
--- around 1,900 Soviet warheads at the end of the Cold War in 1991,
making it, on paper, the world's third-largest nuclear power. In 1994,
the newly independent nation of Ukraine agreed to give those weapons to
Russia in exchange for internationally negotiated security guarantees
that turned out to not be so ironclad. While Ukraine never actually had
control of the weapons, which were connected to command-and-control
systems in Moscow, it's a powerful narrative nonetheless. As the
country's former defense minister [told the New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/science/ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html)
in February, shortly before the invasion, "We gave away the capability
for nothing." [Nicholas Miller, a political scientist at Dartmouth
College who studies nuclear proliferation]{.underline}, said the current
war and recent history underline the advantages of the nuclear
capability. "[**It's already well understood** that nuclear weapons seem
to do a pretty good job at deterring outright invasions," he told
Grid,]{.underline} pointing out that North Korean officials [regularly
invoke the examples of Iraq and
Libya](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/world/asia/25korea.html),
which abandoned their weapons of mass destruction programs and then
found themselves targets of U.S.-led regime change operations. "[**This
just kind of reinforces that**." **None of which suggests a looming
global rush to obtain the bomb**.]{.underline} Davenport said [the more
likely possibility is more states engaging in **nuclear "hedging**":
developing the capabilities to quickly build a bomb without crossing the
red line of actually doing so. Countries have done this as an insurance
policy in case **security guarantees provided by their partners turn out
not to be flawed, or weak**.]{.underline} Japan and Germany are often
cited as examples of this "hedging" strategy.

#### Emerging tech coop signals a decline in US nuclear commitments to NATO

**Mehta 19** (Rupal N. Mehta PhD - Associate Professor in the Department
of Political Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, "Extended
deterrence and assurance in an emerging technology environment", Journal
of Strategic Studies, 3 June 2019,

Constraining assurance: [The drawbacks of emerging technology in
alliances]{.underline}

[While the impact of emerging technologies may yield some positive
dividends in strengthening US's ability to extend deterrence, it may
indeed result in a different set of effects in how assured allies
actually are]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the introduction of
intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of delivery of nuclear
weapons another continent, without requiring forward basing on allied
territory, changed the way that allies and the United States viewed
their opportunity and willingness to protect allied territory.29 [An
increasing reliance on mobile ICBMs that did not require the same degree
of infrastructure as forward-deployed conventional forces or military
personnel **raised concerns** about how credible the US was in its
commitment to defend another territory, potentially at the risk of
inadvertently creating vulnerabilities in US national
defence.]{.underline}

[Despite political rhetoric to the]{.underline} [contrary]{.underline}
(especially from the current administration), [it was challenging to
convince allies in Europe and East Asia that the US would be willing to
undertake action that could potentially risk the security of the US
homeland]{.underline}. This raises an important question: how is this
costly trade-off likely to operate in a cross-domain world where an act
of aggression, potentially a provocation of war, may begin in a
non-kinetic domain? [Perhaps the United States may be willing to enter
into a conflict in defence of an ally if the dispute begins in
**cyberspace** though the uncertainty in response may produce concerns
about the strength of the assurance]{.underline}. While allies are
likely to want a generous interpretation of provocation to encourage
action from the United States, [it is not clear the extent to which the
US may be willing to '**risk New York for Paris'** with the use of
conventional or nuclear force if an ally is attacked with a **cyber
weapon**.30]{.underline} If the threshold or 'redline' for a US military
response is uncertain in the most traditional of security environment,
where known enemies can use physical weapons against a distant US or
allied targets, how security umbrellas are likely to manifest in the
multi-theatre, cross-capability environment is likely to be even more
complex. [Though the foundation of NATO and other multilateral
institutions is argued to be one of capability aggregation,31 the
practice of alliances often reveals the uneven distribution of resources
and assurances through 'pivots' of attention.32]{.underline}

[Indeed, these concerns are likely to be even more prescient with the
development and inclusion of new forms of capabilitie]{.underline}s
(mobile and easy to deploy to multiple places simultaneously) [that can
be easily moved and used elsewhere.]{.underline}33 If this is likely to
be a consequence of the positioning of submarines, aircraft carriers, or
other mobile but discrete assets, [it is difficult to assess how the
'deployment' of cyber or drone technology, that is easier to redeploy to
different theatres in defence of an ally, will impact their perception
of US permanence and commitment to deter foreign
aggressors]{.underline}. As with existing military technologies, [costly
**trade-offs** may complicate cross-domain strategies of extended
deterrence that may **perversely destabilise** already tense regional
environments.]{.underline}

[The current state of US extended deterrence commitments to NATO/Western
Europe has been significantly impacted by a new set of costly challenges
(namely recent Russia behaviour) and the US conventional and nuclear
'pivot to East Asia'.]{.underline} 34 While several studies have pointed
again to Japan and South Korea as examples of protégé states seeking and
receiving renewed assurances from the US against possible North Korean
and Chinese nuclear and conventional threats, [whether the evolving
geo-strategic environment in which emerging technology plays a prominent
role yields the same set of outcomes is uncertain.]{.underline}35 Given
these challenges, [the US has had increasing difficulty assuring its
NATO allies (and subsequently its allies in East Asia) about its
capacity to adequately defend both regions from their respective
adversaries.]{.underline}36 These competing demands for the US to
project hard military power in two distinct regions simultaneously [have
only prompted both sets of allies to become **less persuaded** of US's
capacity to actually defend them in the event of external aggression
(sometimes opting to take matters into their own hands by **pursuing
indigenous advances in military power**). Furthermore, adversaries
themselves may be less convinced of US's commitment to defend its allies
-- motivating some aggressors to use this opportunity to **provoke
allies into disputes** when the extent of the US ability to provide
adequate defence is uncertain.37]{.underline}

[Some states may begin to mirror investment in similar, new types of
technology to counteract the emergence of cross-domain capabilities that
can be used between patrons and their client states. By pinpointing
weaknesses in defensive alliance commitments, some major powers, such as
China, have started to develop 'puncture' capabilities that are low
cost, high technology and highly effective means of countering advances
in extended deterrent capabilities. In]{.underline} the case of China,
for example, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is beginning to
establish 'new-type combat forces' that merge naval aviation, cyber and
special forces to adapt to changing demands for combat readiness and
military doctrine.38 Additionally, China has begun to use 'lowintensity
coercion' to advance its maritime objectives in the East and South China
Seas -- often threatening US allies in the region, including the
Philippines and Japan. While these moves are made to increase China's
presence and control over disputed islands in the region, their strategy
regarding escalation -- and avoiding conflict with the US -- remains
unknown.

These discussions yield several important implications, especially when
we consider how they impact allied decision-making. [This uncertainty
may result in a variety of other second and third-order
effects.]{.underline} First, potential allies may seek commitments from
other patrons seen to be more reliable -- new patrons that still rely on
hard military power. Other the other hand, allies may seek other forms
of assurance or seek to challenge adversaries on their own -- engaging
in moral hazard. [Allies may even begin to develop counter-balancing
technology that allows them independence from their patrons and as a
means to **challenge adversaries**. Without the benefits of capability
aggregation in alliances or enhanced security through substitution, this
could impact the value of alliances for allies (or their patrons). In
aggregate, such consideration raises important concerns about how
emerging technologies will influence the allied side of the strategic
interaction.]{.underline}

#### **Lack of confidence in the US [nuclear]{.underline} commitment enables [nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**

**Pelopidas 15** (Benoit Pelopidas - CISAC affiliate and lecturer in
international relations at the School of Sociology, Politics and
International Studies, "Chapter 3: The Nuclear Straitjacket", The Future
of Extended Deterrence, Pages 73-74, Georgetown University Press, 2015,
MG)

In international relations theory, the most famous proponents of
structural realism, area studies specialists inspired by it, and even
critical voices have formulated forecasts and policy recommendations
based on the nuclear straitjacket, even if their analytical assessments
are often formulated in probabilistic terms.8 [Major proponents of
structural realism argued that the protection offered by the two
superpowers during the Cold War was the essential cause of **nuclear
nonproliferation** during that period. This led to a series of
proliferation forecasts about the post-- Cold War period.9]{.underline}
Benjamin Frankel offers the clearest formulation of this alternative
when he writes that ["there is an inherent contradiction between
welcoming the end of bipolarity and deploring the spread of nuclear
weapons" and "it is precisely the large size and sophistication of the
superpowers' nuclear forces, and the avowed **willingness of the
superpowers to threaten to use them on behalf of their clients**, . . .
that have prevented a more pervasive **weapons
proliferation**."]{.underline}10 Most recently, Michael Horowitz phrases
the nuclear straitjacket in terms of likelihood when he writes that
["\[i\]n a world where progress towards arms reductions reverses, some
states with civilian nuclear power might begin to prepare quietly for a
world where they need to build their own small nuclear
arsenal.]{.underline} Such an outcome might become likely if the
economic struggles in the United States lead the country to pull back
significantly from its international obligations, including its extended
deterrence umbrella."11

A similar tendency can be identified in works of area studies
specialists inspired by structural realism. Beyond the works of John
Mearsheimer on the necessity of an in de pen dent nuclear deterrent in
Ukraine, Fiona Hill and Pamela Jewett can be mentioned.12 A few months
before Kiev decided to give its weapons back to Russia, it insisted on
the protection that these weapons would offer against a Russia depicted
as expansionist, notably because of the remaining Russian minority in
Eastern Ukraine.13 Similarly, Yair Evron accepts the idea that the end
of bipolarity created additional incentives to get nuclear weapons.14
Some interpretations of the German case and, more broadly, of nuclear
abstinence inside the Eu ro pean community tend to rely on the nuclear
straitjacket.15 Most recently, Andrew Kennedy argued that "[implicit
nuclear umbrellas" and disarmament diplomacy were key drivers of Indian
nuclear restraint until 1998.16]{.underline}

Even critical voices like Glenn Chafetz, who intends to build an
"alternative to the neo- realist perspective" for the post-- Cold War
world, ends up transposing the argument of the nuclear straitjacket at
the level of perceptions. In his view, [what matters for forecasting
proliferation is not whether the protector will maintain its security
guarantee but if the **protégé believes the protector will do so**.17
This approach leaves room for the possibility that the protégé could
**misinterpret the intentions of the protector** and decide not to go
for the bomb even though the protector has not made a sincere credible
pledge. Thus, the protégé in this instance would not go nuclear because
it believes that the protector's defective pledge of extended nuclear
deterrence is valid. The fact that the protégé makes a mistake should
not mask that its supposed reasoning remains the same.18]{.underline}
Most recently, Francis Gavin argues that [the resolve to strike as a
foundation of a credible nuclear security guarantee might have created
**incentives to go for the bomb** for countries to which the deterrent
pledge is not extended]{.underline}, but he does not criticize the
effi - cacy of extended nuclear deterrence as a nonproliferation tool.19

#### **Allied prolif causes [nuke war]{.underline}, Asian [nuclear arms races]{.underline}, and [collapses alliances]{.underline}**

Gerzhoy and **Miller 16** (Gene Gerzhoy - Former Research Fellow Project
on Managing the Atom/International Security Program and now a
Congressional Fellow at the American Political Science Association,
Nicholas Miller - Associate Professor in the Department of Government at
Dartmouth College, "Donald Trump thinks more countries should have
nuclear weapons. Here's what the research says", The Washington Post, 6

MG)

[Research does not support the idea that the spread of nuclear weapons
is **inevitable**]{.underline}. But isolationist "America First"
policies could prompt that spread. Defining U.S. strategic interests
primarily in terms of monetary gain, and [curtailing U.S. global
engagement toward that end, would boost the probability that our
**allies would respond by going nuclear**.]{.underline}

Would nuclear proliferation be good for U.S. interests?

What about Trump's second proposition: that proliferation by our allies
would be good for U.S. interests? This argument is based on the idea
that nuclear-armed allies could help contain U.S. adversaries and enable
the United States to save money. As Trump told Cooper, "I would rather
see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against
North Korea." And as he suggested, the United States can't afford to
protect Japan and South Korea --- and therefore, "they have to pay us or
we have to let them protect themselves."

[Reducing military commitments and letting allies build their own
nuclear weapons might save money for the United States. But
international relations scholarship suggests that allied proliferation
would have broader negative repercussions. Among these would be
**declining U.S. influence**. When nations gain their own military
capabilities, they **rely less on their allies** and become less subject
to their sway. And that can undermine a senior partner's ability to hold
its junior allies back from risky military actions.]{.underline}

[In other words, allowing or encouraging proliferation would worsen the
"American weakness"]{.underline} that Trump decries.

[Recent nonproliferation research underscores this proposition. Mark
Bell shows that nuclear allies are likely to become more independent of
their patrons and in some cases can **develop more assertive foreign
policies**.]{.underline} And Francis Gavin and Matthew Kroenig show that
the fear of declining influence was one reason why most American
administrations vigorously opposed the spread of nuclear weapons.

[**Nuclear allies** can also become **security risks**.]{.underline}
Vipin Narang demonstrates that [when weaker states gain nuclear weapons,
they often seek to coerce their senior partners into intervening on
their behalf by threatening to use nuclear weapons]{.underline}. That's
what Israel did at the height of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. That's what
South Africa did during its 1988 confrontation with Cuban forces in
Angola. And that's what Pakistan did in the midst of its 1990 military
crisis with India.

Instead of relieving the United States of a military burden, as Donald
Trump suggests, [having more nuclear allies could increase the risk that
the United States would **get involved in conflicts that might turn
nuclear**.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, were South Korea or Japan to begin developing nuclear
weapons, their rivals might be tempted to launch preventive military
strikes]{.underline}, which research suggests has been frequently
considered in the past. [The road to nuclear acquisition is often rocky
and **increases the likelihood of militarized conflict**]{.underline}.
For example, Soviet worries that West Germany would acquire nuclear
weapons helped trigger the Berlin Crisis.

[And if Japan or South Korea actually acquired nuclear weapons, we could
possibly see a **nuclear arms race in Asia**.]{.underline} Japan's
neighbors, including South Korea, would fear resurgent Japanese
militarism. [North Korea would expand its nuclear capabilities. China
would continue to expand its own nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}

Why haven't we seen nuclear arms races before?

[Nuclear "domino
effects"](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/558060) have
not been common historically. But that's largely because of [determined
U.S. efforts to stop
them](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2014.874189).

Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has [pursued
nonproliferation as a top policy
priority](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00205#.VwAzcxMrJfQ).
That includes sponsoring and enforcing the [Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT)](http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPTtext.shtml). [Research
suggests the
NPT](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/682080) has been
instrumental in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, in part by
coordinating states' beliefs about one another's nonproliferation
commitments. To develop nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea would
need to violate or withdraw from the NPT. [That could prompt U.S. allies
and adversaries in other regions --- including Saudi Arabia, Germany and
Iran --- to question the treaty's viability and consider seeking their
own nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}

Would this be so bad? After all, no two nuclear armed states have fought
a major war with each other, and nuclear weapons have not been used in
conflict since the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

[But the conclusion that nuclear weapons produce peace is subject to
debate. It's true that there has been no war between major powers since
1945. But that may be due
to [other](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2538971) [factors](https://books.google.com/books?id=J7ATQb6LZX0C&dq=pinker+angels&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s).
The quantitative evidence linking nuclear weapons to a reduced risk of
conflict
is **[limited](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/57/3/478.short) [at
best](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/59/1/74)**.]{.underline}

[Further, [theoretical and historical evidence suggests that **nuclear
accidents and miscalculations are
likely**](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5301.html). More countries
with nuclear weapons would mean more opportunities for catastrophic
nuclear mistakes.]{.underline}

So what's the takeaway?

[A look at history shows us that nuclear proliferation is **anything but
inevitable**.]{.underline} U.S. nonproliferation efforts have been
surprisingly successful, even when the United States was weaker than it
is today.

Without firm U.S. opposition to the spread of nuclear weapons --- a
policy implemented through "carrots" like alliances and "sticks" like
sanctions --- the world would probably have far more than nine countries
with nuclear weapons. [What's more, research suggests that nuclear
proliferation would **reduce U.S. world influence**, undermine global
stability and **increase the risk of nuclear war**.]{.underline}

## Uniqueness

### U - Brink Now

#### **Ukraine set the [brink]{.underline} -- it's up to [US credibility]{.underline} now**

**Schepers 6/2** (Névine Schepers - a Senior Researcher in the Swiss and

MG)

[By bringing nuclear weapons back in the international limelight, the
war seems to have emphasized the benefits of relying on nuclear
deterrence, inciting **fears of renewed proliferation**. Given that the
outcome of the war remains unknown, it is **too early to draw
conclusions** about whether this will encourage more states to develop
nuclear programs]{.underline}. However, some preliminary effects are
already apparent.

On the one hand, Ukraine's history as a former Soviet Republic that
inherited and subsequently returned Soviet nuclear weapons to Moscow in
exchange for security assurances gives a different tone to Russia's use
of deterrence in this war. The appeal of such negative security
assurances has therefore diminished. Within the NPT regime, many
non-nuclear weapon states have previously placed particular emphasis on
negative security assurances as a means to protect themselves from
nuclear conflict. The breaching of such an assurance to Ukraine further
undermines efforts to address security gaps posed by the imbalance
between nuclear haves and have-nots. [More than 100 non-nuclear weapon
states rely on negative security assurances included in the protocols to
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones treaties. If those are no longer deemed
credible and a state feels under existential threat, developing a
**domestic nuclear deterrent** may appear more appealing in the
future.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, the relevance of positive security guarantees,
established through legally binding frameworks such as NATO, has
increased,]{.underline} as Sweden and Finland's requests for NATO
accession illustrate. This reinforces the perceived value of extended
deterrence, [meaning the commitment of a nuclear power to deter and
respond to attacks in defense of allies. When allies are **confident in
the credibility of extended deterrence**, they **refrain** from
developing their own deterrent.3 However]{.underline}, [increased
reliance on such security guarantees in Europe adds further weight on
the US as the central deterrence provider]{.underline}. [While
Washington's allies are moving to reinforce conventional deterrence
capabilities, the credibility of nuclear deterrence will mostly remain a
**US responsibility**]{.underline}, one that has to withstand future
election cycles and potential Trump-like leadership figures.

["Our country should also develop a nuclear program. And prepare for a
possible nuclear war,\"]{.underline} said Lee, voicing a desire that a
February poll showed was shared by 3 out of 4 South Koreans.

[It's a point that people and politicians of non-nuclear powers globally
are raising more often, at what has become a **destabilizing**
**moment** in more than a half-century of global nuclear
nonproliferation efforts, one aggravated by the daily example of nuclear
Russia tearing apart non-nuclear Ukraine]{.underline}.

That reconsideration by non-nuclear states is playing out in Asia. The
region is home to an ever-more assertive North Korea, China, Russia and
Iran --- three nuclear powers and one near-nuclear power --- but is
unprotected by the kind of nuclear umbrella and broad defense alliance
that for decades has shielded NATO countries.

[Vulnerable countries will **look to the lessons from Ukraine** ---
especially whether Russia succeeds in swallowing big pieces of Ukraine
while brandishing its nuclear arsenal to hold other nations at bay ---
as they consider keeping or pursuing nuclear weapons, security experts
say.]{.underline}

[As important, they say, is how well the **U.S. and its allies** are
persuading other partners in Europe, the Persian Gulf and Asia to trust
in the shield of **U.S.-led nuclear and conventional arsenals** and not
pursue their own nuclear bombs.]{.underline}

### U -- AT Allied Prolif Now

#### **Ukraine war [won't]{.underline} start nuclear prolif BUT is causing allied [interest]{.underline} in it to rise**

**Dalton 4/8** (Toby Dalton - Senior fellow and co-director of the
Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, "Nuclear Nonproliferation After the Russia-Ukraine War",
Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 8 April 2022,
<https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/04/08/nuclear-nonproliferation-after-the-russia-ukraine-war/>,
MG)

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine, accompanied by nuclear threats to deter
intervention by NATO states, is **unlikely to spark a broad wave of
nuclear proliferation**. However, growing concerns among political
leaders in Japan and South Korea about nuclear coercion by China and
North Korea, and questions about the **durability of U.S. defense
commitments**, is driving interest in nuclear acquisition.]{.underline}
To stanch this interest, the United States may be pressured to share
nuclear weapons with these allies, while Russia could look to deploy
nuclear weapons on the territories of its allies.

A popular but ahistorical narrative is emerging about Russia's war on
Ukraine: if only Kyiv had retained the Soviet nuclear weapons stationed
on its territory at the end of the Cold War, it could have deterred
Vladimir Putin's nuclear-backed annexation of Crimea in 2014 and
attempted occupation of the rest of Ukraine today. This narrative
ignores the fact that those weapons were controlled by Russia and
Ukrainian leaders at the time did not want to be treated as an
international pariah for attempting to become a nuclear-armed state.
[Rather than focus on a flawed counterfactual that emphasizes the
importance of nuclear power, the world would be much better off asking
how Russia's actions could affect nuclear nonproliferation. In the
context of perceived growing risks of inter-state conflict and a
re-ordering of the international system, it is plausible that one or
more countries **worried** about suffering a similar fate as Ukraine
**decide to seek nuclear weapons**,]{.underline} or that Russia and the
United States opt to violate international nonproliferation rules by
sharing nuclear weapons with allies.

#### **NATO allies have [limited anxiety]{.underline} now\-\--fear of a [revived pivot]{.underline} is lingering**

[Any transatlantic debate on deterrence takes its cues from the U.S.
debate. Due to its large international role, its correspondingly large
military, and its sizable and vibrant strategic community, the United
States has been at the forefront of deterrence thinking since the advent
of the nuclear age. Its unique role as the military
protector]{.underline} of many countries in and beyond NATO [has given
U.S. thinking on deterrence]{.underline} and other security matters
[enormous weight. If in the past mainstream U.S. deterrence thinking
often had a streak of alarmism, it largely stemmed from concerns about
the **credibility of extended deterrence**.]{.underline} As this concept
seeks to deter an adversary from attacking an ally of the United States,
rather than the U.S. homeland itself, [it was burdened with a
credibility dilemma that it sought to ameliorate by the
forwarddeployment of conventional and **nuclear forces**]{.underline},
as well as through unique nuclear sharing arrangements. In retrospect,
[it is fair to say that Europeans were generally less concerned with the
specifics of the Western deterrence posture, as long as certain
basics---above all, a strong and credible U.S. commitment to European
security---remained assured.]{.underline}

[The fact that a **growing number of European observers** now fear that
this U.S. commitment is **waning** is among the greatest game changers
in the deterrence debate. Washington's harsh criticism of **European
military underperformance** as well as the **emergence of China** as the
new U.S. strategic rival have sparked **European nervousness** about
Washington's continued commitment to the security of the
continent]{.underline}.26 Although the United States reacted promptly to
reassure NATO's eastern allies after Russia's annexation of Crimea,
thereby demonstrating its continued interest in European security,
[fears of abandonment have led to a lively discussion about European
alternatives to U.S.-centric security arrangements]{.underline}.
However, this discussion is likely to yield few tangible results. Europe
remains a conglomerate of nation states of different sizes, cultures,
historical experiences, and geographic outlooks. Hence, there is no
European strategic culture that could form a basis for a European-only
deterrence policy and posture. A U.S. exit from Europe may force some
countries to explore new forms of closer defense cooperation, yet others
are more likely to pursue separate bilateral deals with Washington.

### L -- Non-Nuclear Deterrence

#### Perception of US introduction of emerging tech to deter undermines the traditional justifications for nuclear presence. Shreds assurances and leads to war.

[The impact of **new technologies and emerging military capabilities**
on nuclear deterrence is the subject of intense debate among experts,
with multiple and often contradictory hypotheses.]{.underline} 14 Some
assert that the nature of [nuclear deterrence will be radically
transformed]{.underline} and that the increased vulnerability of nuclear
systems and [improved defences will lead to the role of nuclear weapons
becoming **marginalised**, an increase in the number of nuclear weapons
or the adoption of more dangerous nuclear postures by some
possessors]{.underline} (e.g. predelegation, launch-on-warning,
pre-emption). But there are also more conservative predictions---namely
that new technologies may not fully deliver on their disruptive promises
and/or that their offensive advantages would be balanced by defensive
countermeasures, leaving the role of nuclear deterrence more or less
intact.

The analysis conducted so far in this chapter seems to indicate that the
European True Believers (in nuclear deterrence) remain unconvinced that
any radical changes are approaching. The UK and France are taking steps
to safeguard the functioning of their nuclear deterrence in a more
challenging environment, utilising the assistance of new technologies.
But they continue to see the role of nuclear weapons as 'ultima ratio'
in escalation management and retaliation, to which no comparable
alternative is likely to emerge. This is likely to remain the default
position.

**non-nuclear capabilities by the US** will have an impact on the
**alliance's nuclear deterrence posture,** especially regarding the
rationale for maintaining US forwarddeployed nuclear forces in Europe
and continuing NATO's nuclear sharing. If US non-nuclear capabilities
are **seen as providing the same or perhaps a higher level of
deterrence** as nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, this may strengthen
the case for their **withdrawal to the US** or **complete
elimination**]{.underline}. One can envisage, for example, deployment of
intermediate-range conventional hypersonic systems in Europe as
substitutes for B61 nuclear bombs. [In that case, the main axis of
frictions may be between the US and those states that are particularly
attracted to the forward deployment of nuclear weapons (even if they are
not stationed on their territories), such as Poland and other eastern
flank countries. These would most likely point out that Russia would
treat the replacement of **nuclear assets with non-nuclear ones as an
invitation to escalate any crisis to the nuclear level**, and that a
nuclear-sharing model that includes direct involvement of a number of
European allies **cannot easily be replicated** with regard to most of
the new capabilities.]{.underline}

[A number of other political-military challenges may arise. First, we
may face the emergence of a gap in thinking about **escalation
management** and the employment of new capabilities between the US and
its allies, with consequences for the nuclear sphere. The US is likely
to maintain its preeminence in terms of the development and deployment
of new technologies, and of formulating conceptual approaches as regards
their use. Since individual NATO countries, most importantly the UK and
France, aim to actively contribute their own ideas and approaches to
discussions on issues such as **artificial intelligence** development,
space and **cyber** policy, common NATO positions can be formulated.
However, the US is likely to be far ahead of the majority of NATO
allies. Further, the US and other technologically advanced allies may
not be willing to share the full details of some of the more sensitive
technologies they possess at NATO fora.]{.underline} The September 2021
announcement of the creation of the trilateral security partnership
between the US, Australia and the UK (AUKUS) can be seen as potentially
contributing to this trend. While the initial attention was focused on
the nuclear-powered submarines, [the participants also pledged closer
cooperation on **cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence**, quantum
technologies and other undersea capabilities. This may lead to
strengthening the links and interoperability between the three
countries, but would not engage NATO]{.underline} (which has a broad
partnership relationship with Australia) [as a whole.]{.underline}

[Consequently, in a crisis, allies may be surprised by certain US
actions and their escalatory effects]{.underline}. This may not
necessarily be caused by any lack of consultation or advanced warning
[but may happen because of their lack of understanding of the doctrinal,
technological and military aspects of the US's approach to operations.
15 The reverse may also be true. The US may be **forced to react to
developments** arising from the employment of **new technologies by some
of its NATO allies**, including a situation in which such an action
escalates conflict to the **nuclear threshold** (e.g. cyber attack on
the adversary's nuclear command and control)]{.underline}. The
alliance's response to this challenge will need to take the form of
in-depth consultations, developing joint doctrinal documents and
investment in simulations and wargaming.

Second, integration of new capabilities and new domains into the
deterrence and defence toolbox seems inevitable. Some changes will have
important consequences at the tactical and operational levels (e.g.
ubiquity of low-cost unmanned systems and their increased level of
autonomy and effectiveness) and some may reach the strategic level. [Any
sudden devaluation of nuclear deterrence due to a technological
breakthrough---for example, the end of ballistic missile submarines'
'near-invulnerability'---would have major ramifications and force the
three NATO nuclear possessors to re-evaluate their posture, with major
consequences for the alliance. But less revolutionary changes may be
significant, as they would impact on traditional NATO approaches to
burden and risk-sharing, deterrence and assurance.]{.underline}

In the foreseeable future, a scenario of US military disengagement from
NATO and Europe remains far-fetched, which means that Europe can rely on
the full range of US capabilities when facing Russia. [However, if the
US or other allies were able to provide advanced strategic non-nuclear
assets for common defence and deterrence, they may be inclined to reduce
the 'traditional' contributions of their armed forces.]{.underline} The
UK's recent Integrated Review may pave the way, as it highlights the
contribution of UK offensive cyber and precision strike capabilities (as
well as nuclear forces) to NATO, while simultaneously reducing the size
of its land forces. Other allies may follow the same logic. [For
example, some of the European states currently hosting US nuclear
weapons may be interested in exploring the option of providing specific
**new capabilities** to the alliance **instead of continuing with their
nuclear mission**. However, the question would arise as to whether such
a rebalancing and new division of labor would increase the credibility
of deterrence or be seen as weakening NATO's ability to provide the
necessary levels of 'boots on the ground'.]{.underline}

[Third, there is a danger of **increased polarisation** between the
allies interested in making full use of the opportunities created by EDT
and those advocating more restraint and engagement with potential
adversaries as the best way to reduce the destabilising effects of new
technologies. 16 In the NATO context, one can expect future discussions
about the deployment of specific weapon systems, which may resemble Cold
War--era debates between the proponents of strengthening deterrence and
pursuing arms control.]{.underline} For example, should NATO countries
move forward with, or rather aim to limit, the deployment of certain
categories of autonomous or hypersonic systems, looking for similar
restraint from Russia?

Finally, NATO's adversaries will have a vote in deciding the future role
of nuclear weapons and new capabilities in the alliance's deterrence
mix. The further pursuit of new military technologies by Russia, and
increased lethality of its own mix of offensive and defensive
non-nuclear capabilities, will necessitate a periodical review and
adaptation of NATO's approach. The issue will become particularly
pressing if Russia manages to achieve dominance on some non-nuclear
'rungs' of escalation---for example, hypersonic precision strike systems
or counterspace capabilities. [The alliance may then be forced to
broaden the role of nuclear weapons to maintain the credibility of its
deterrence strategy, including potentially an **explicit threat of
nuclear retaliation** to non-nuclear strategic attacks, or prepare its
own non-nuclear response, using a range of new
technologies.]{.underline}

#### **Nuclear deterrence [post-ukraine]{.underline} avoids WMD terrorism and [nuclear war]{.underline}**

law at Purdue, "Nuclear War Avoidance: Why It Is Time to Start Worrying,

[Any planetary system of law and power management]{.underline} that
[seeks to avoid nuclear war]{.underline} must recognize a significantly
underlying axiom: as egregious crimes under international law, war and
genocide need not be mutually exclusive.25 On the contrary, as one may
learn from history, [war could sometimes be undertaken as an efficient
manner of national, ethnic, racial, or religious
annihilation.26]{.underline} This was almost certainly the case with
respect to Germany's World War II aggressions, crimes oriented
deliberately to Adolph Hitler's always primary war against the Jews.
[When the war in question becomes nuclear, the **argument must become
unassailable**.]{.underline}

[In light of **Russia's 2022 war against Ukraine**, it is time to start
worrying again about nuclear war avoidance, but this time, just worrying
will not be enough. The only reasonable use for nuclear weapons on this
imperiled planet will still be as **controlled elements of dissuasion**
and never as actual weapons of war. The underlying principles of such a
rational diplomatic posture go back long before the advent of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} In his oft-studied classic On War, ancient Chinese
strategist Sun-Tzu reminds succinctly, "subjugating the enemy's army
without fighting is the true pinnacle of excellence."27

There can be no more compelling strategic dictum. This distilled wisdom
represents the "one big thing" for US strategists, commanders, and
policy makers to know. [It would be best not to have any enemies in the
first place, of course, but such residually high hopes would be without
any intellectual foundation. They would always **remain
unsupportable**.]{.underline}

[The unwelcome outcomes in Afghanistan and recent Russian invasion of
Ukraine do not portend heightened nuclear warfare prospects per se, but
they do suggest a generally widening **diminution of American power**.
Among other things, this diminution could spawn various regional or even
global crises that bring the United States into a much larger ambit of
**WMD scenarios**, ones involving both **war** and **terror**. Even if
the United States does not become involved in any such crises directly,
other states or even the wider world could quickly become entangled in
extremis atomicum.]{.underline}

Immediately, to whatever extent possible, national leaders should make
all appropriate intellectual and analytic preparations for nuclear war
avoidance. In carrying out this responsibility, especially careful
attention should be directed to the scenarios of inadvertent nuclear
war, as well as narratives pertaining both to accidental nuclear
conflict and to a nuclear war resulting from miscalculation. [All the
while, prospects for a deliberate nuclear war should never be
downplayed; preparations for **credible nuclear deterrence must be
continuously maintained at the highest possible levels**]{.underline}.
To meet this urgent requirement, leaders of nuclear and near-nuclear
states must first acknowledge the recurrent seriousness of a global
atomic threat. [This is not a time for any leadership complacence.
Instead, it is an optimal time to "start worrying again]{.underline}."Θκ

The NPR overstated the improvement in US-Russia relations, and the US
declaration that Russia was not an enemy did not consider how Russia
viewed the relationship. Failure to take into account that country's
deep-seated suspicion of the United States invalidated the NPR's
assumption that improved ties would allow the United States to rely less
on nuclear weapons. Further, US policy and Russian policy do not agree
on the usability of nuclear weapons. [The US desire to decrease the role
of nuclear weapons and compensate with conventional weapons suggests
that **US policy makers do not feel that nuclear weapons are
usable**]{.underline}. However, this perception contrasts with Russia's
nuclear doctrine and statements, which have been consistent for well
over a decade, that these weapons are quite usable. These differences
are further emphasized as the United States debates unilateral reduction
in nuclear capabilities while Russia violates a landmark arms-control
treaty to increase the types and capabilities of its nuclear arsenal to
gain a strategic advantage.46 [This situation creates a dangerous divide
that has the potential for **miscalculation and deterrence
failure**.]{.underline}

[Both Russia and China are concerned with US use of advanced
conventional capabilities in a strategic manner to negate their nuclear
deterrent. According to the NPR, the United States has the strongest
conventional capabilities in the world and an alliance system that
further augments those capabilities.]{.underline} America has also
demonstrated its willingness to use conventional power repeatedly over
the last 25 years. [The very usability of conventional precision-strike
weapons capable of creating effects once reserved only for nuclear
forces undermines deterrence by creating or reinforcing perceptions in
our adversaries that their **nuclear forces are vulnerable** and that
the United States may have an incentive to strike them. Both China and
Russia are reevaluating their nuclear doctrines and **relying more on
nuclear** weapons to counter this perceived threat.]{.underline}

Conclusion

From nuclear weapons' pinnacle of importance at the end of the Cold War
to today, the United States has steadily decreased the attention paid to
its nuclear arsenal and strategy, but [nuclear deterrence has not
decreased in its overall importance. It is clear that our adversaries
place much more value in their nuclear arsenals than does the United
States, precisely to deter America's unmatched conventional power. The
US decision to rely more on conventional weapons to achieve nuclear
deterrence has created dangerous potential for miscalculation in its
deterrent relationships with Russia and China.]{.underline}

[The United States has fallen into a "**mirror imaging" trap** by
assuming that other nations place the same low value on nuclear weapons
that it does and that they have the same priority of reaching "Global
Zero."]{.underline} The Obama administration has even gone so far as to
recommend unilateral nuclear reductions, which were made outside
arms-control negotiations with Russia.47 Part of this policy is that
other nuclear-armed nations will follow the US example and choose to
reduce the size of their nuclear arsenal. This assumption does not take
into account how our opponents interpret their security environment and
the role that nuclear weapons play in safeguarding their interests.

#### Enhanced [non-nuclear]{.underline} deterrence undermines allied assurance

[All this suggests that the paramount role of the United States in
setting the overall direction of Western deterrence thinking will
**remain unchanged**.27]{.underline} However, as the U.S. strategic
community---like U.S. society more broadly---appears more and more
polarized, deterrence thinking, too, has become bifurcated. While U.S.
policy remains firmly grounded in what Keith Payne has termed "difficult
deterrence" (e.g., [strong conventional forces]{.underline}, limited
nuclear options, missile defenses, little or no arms control), there is
also an idealist streak that ranges from advocating more sweeping arms
control measures all the way to nuclear abolition.28 While this latter
school of thought had failed when President Obama sought to adopt some
of its elements during his first tenure, it still commands considerable
political respectability and could return with a new Democratic
administration.

Both schools of thought [can be a challenge for European
security]{.underline}. [By giving short shrift to arms control and by
advocating **new weapon systems** to fill alleged gaps in the Western
deterrence posture vis-à-vis a more risk-prone Russia, the orthodox
deterrence school tends to irritate those Europeans who worry about the
effects of such policies on their own public opinion.]{.underline} By
contrast, the arms control school's preference for cooperative solutions
[runs the risk of interpreting certain alliance achievements (e.g.,
nuclear sharing arrangements or U.S. ballistic missile defense
installations in Europe) as a potential hindrance on the way to new
agreements. Hence, some Europeans,]{.underline} notably in the
continent's East, [could get **nervous** about what in their view would
constitute a naïve U.S. approach in dealing with Russia or other
opponents.]{.underline}

[Nuclear strategy is about more than just deterrence]{.underline} (see
the table opposite). [Deterrence is the use of retaliatory threats to
dissuade an adversary from attacking oneself or one's
allies]{.underline}. Deterrence can be categorized into central
deterrence (deterrence of an attack on one's homeland) and extended
deterrence (deterrence of an attack on one's strategic partners)
(Cimbala, 2002). Nuclear weapons can also be used for
compellence---coercing the enemy into doing something that it does not
want to do (Long, 2008, p. 9). In addition to coercive deterrence and
compellence threats, nuclear weapons can be employed for warfighting,
the way they were at the end of the Second World War. [The practical
complexities of nuclear strategy stem from the challenges of
assurance---making extended deterrence credible. During the Cold War,
the United States accumulated its massive stockpile of strategic and
tactical nuclear weapons to convince its allies that that it would be
willing to retaliate to conventional Soviet attacks in Europe with
nuclear responses. As United Kingdom Defence Minister Denis Healey
observed, it took "**only five per cent credibility of American
retaliation to deter the Russians, but ninety five per cent credibility
to reassure the Europeans**" (Healey, 1989).]{.underline} The scale of
the U.S. nuclear arsenal, however, alarmed Soviet leaders, who believed
that the Americans might be attempting to develop a first-strike
capability against them. This distrust underscored the need for
reassurance---convincing adversaries that they will not be attacked as
long as they refrain from the behavior that is being deterred
(Schelling, 1966).

\[Chart Omitted\]

Strategic stability exists when adversaries lack a significant incentive
to engage in provocative behavior.5 There are several kinds of strategic
stability that are distinguished by their varying temporal scales.
First-strike stability exists when no state can carry out an attack out
of the blue against its opponent without significant fear of a
devastating retaliation. Such a possibility is best deterred by the
threat of overwhelming and automatic retaliation from secure
second-strike forces (Cimbala, 2002, p. 66). Crisis stability, by
contrast, aims to prevent or manage escalation during crises, as
occurred in Berlin and Cuba in the early 1960s (Cimbala, 2002, p. 98).
In these circumstances, national leaders are under immense pressure not
to show weakness by backing down, but the chance of inadvertent
escalation increases significantly as states attempt to maneuver the
nuclear forces for signaling purposes. In this context, the kind of
large automatic retaliation that is ideal for maximizing first-strike
stability is a recipe for disaster.

Finally, arms race stability is achieved when there are no exploitable
inequalities in adversaries' military capabilities (Cimbala, 2002, p.
110). States avoid these inequalities to manage the risks and costs of
long-term competition and to avoid compromising first-strike stability
and crisis stability in the future. Nuclear strategy is difficult
because these objectives are in tension with each other.

In an extreme case, [**AI could undermine the condition of MAD and make
nuclear war winnable**, but it takes much less to undermine strategic
stability. AI advancements merely need to **cast doubt on the
credibility of retaliation** at some level of conflict. Major nuclear
powers, such as the United States, Russia, and China, have a shared
interest in maintaining the credibility of central deterrence, but they
seek regional advantages in pursuit of what they regard as their core
strategic interests. Areas where credibility is already strained, such
as certain **extended deterrence guarantees**, are **particularly
vulnerable to destabilization**. The increasingly multipolar strategic
environment is also encouraging forms of competition that threaten
stability. For instance, the United States is interested in developing
the capability to track and target a minor nuclear power's mobile
missile launchers, but Russia and China fear that the same technology
could mature into a threat to their more sophisticated retaliatory
forces. In a crisis situation, the employment or availability of
AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) or
weapon systems could stoke tensions and increase the chances of
inadvertent escalation. Finally, the pursuit of advanced military
capabilities is **liable to cause arms race instability** even if those
technologies are nonviable, as in the historical case of missile
defense. The challenge AI poses to strategic stability is not unique to
this particular technology, but it is more acute because of rapid
technical progress in AI and its many potential intersections with
nuclear strategy]{.underline}. Most of the specific applications AI are
likely to be used for, such as analysis of ISR data, controlling
autonomous sensor platforms, and automated target recognition (ATR) have
been eagerly sought for decades but were beyond the capability of
available technology. Even without further breakthroughs, [incremental
progress using existing AI techniques may make these **long-sought goals
practical realities** in the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

[Both Russia and China appear to believe that the United States is
attempting to leverage AI to threaten the survivability of their
strategic nuclear forces, stoking mutual distrust that could prove
catastrophic in a crisis. As Paul Bracken observes, ongoing improvements
in technology such as AI threaten to "**undermine minimum deterrence
strategies**" and "blur the line between conventional and nuclear war"
(Bracken, 2017).]{.underline}

### L -- Biotechnology

#### **Changing biotech defensive posture [away]{.underline} from [ambiguous]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline} gives the perception of weakening US [commitments]{.underline}**

**Péczeli 17** (Anna Péczeli - postdoctoral research fellow at the
Center for Global Security Research at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, "Best Options for the Nuclear Posture Review", Strategic
Studies Quarterly Volume 11, Fall 2017,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26271605.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A6fe35810b46ec7d6f99b78951d9cc1c9&ab_segments=&origin=&acceptTC=1>,
MG)

During the debate under the Obama administration, [the DOD cautioned
against dramatic changes in declaratory policy and emphasized the
benefits of the long-standing tradition of the so-called calculated
ambiguity strategy. The main idea behind this strategy is that the
United States **does not specify the nature of response** to a
non-nuclear aggression but at the same time it threatens with an
overwhelming and devastating counterattack. This could mean an
**asymmetric nuclear attack** in response to the use of chemical or
biological weapons.28]{.underline} Maintaining this option implies that
the Obama administration still saw a few non-nuclear scenarios when [the
threat of a devastating nuclear response was deemed **essential** for
the security of the United States or its allies and
partners.]{.underline}

As a result, the 2010 NPR concluded that sole purpose was acceptable as
a long-term goal but the current circumstances were not adequate to
implement it immediately. The document stated, "the United States is
therefore not prepared at the present time to adopt a universal policy
that deterring nuclear attack is the sole purpose of nuclear weapons,
but will work to establish conditions under which such a policy could be
safely adopted."29 To create these conditions, the United States
outlined two goals: first, it "will continue to strengthen conventional
capabilities and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in deterring
non-nuclear attacks, with the objective of making deterrence of nuclear
attack on the United States or our allies and partners the sole purpose
of U.S. nuclear weapons"30 and, second, it will "continue efforts to
strengthen regional security architectures and eliminate chemical and
biological weapons, so that over time all states possessing nuclear
weapons can be secure in making deterrence of nuclear attack the sole
purpose of nuclear weapons."31

[It is very unlikely that the adversaries of the United States could
pose an existential threat with conventional, chemical, or biological
weapons (CBW]{.underline}). Taking into consideration the unquestionable
conventional superiority of the United States, conventional weapons
could provide an adequate response option in any of the above scenarios.
[However, a number of allies (such as the Baltic States or Israel) still
believe that their neighbors could actually threaten their existence
with non-nuclear means. In these cases, US extended **nuclear
deterrence** and calculated ambiguity are considered crucial to prevent
such an attack. Therefore, declaring a sole purpose posture]{.underline}
under the current circumstances [would be seen by some allies as a
**weakening of US commitments**.]{.underline} This, however, does not
mean that the Trump administration should renounce sole purpose. It
should, in fact, recommit to sole purpose as a long-term goal because it
would be a demonstration of its intention to live up to its NPT
commitments by reducing the role of nuclear weapons in the future. Just
as during the 2010 NPT Review Conference, this could strengthen US
negotiating positions at the 2020 RevCon by alleviating criticism from
the non-nuclear weapon states.

### L - Cyber

#### **Developing cyber capabilities and OCOs raises [questions]{.underline} over the effectiveness of [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**

**Vizier 21** (Soléne Vizier - holds a double Master\'s degree in
Strategic Studies from the University of Paris and in Cybersecurity,

MG)

[States' cyber capabilities are]{.underline} changing the composition of
conventional and nuclear weapons systems, and [challenging the
**principle of \"nuclear deterrence**\".]{.underline}

[While new technologies support system functionality, real-time
decision-making and data processing, new computers and complex codes
also make systems less secure, more difficult to protect and therefore
easier to compromise. Increased reliance on increasingly complex
information systems for nuclear operations increases the possibility of
errors, failures and accidents]{.underline}. Similarly, the increasing
use of commercial technologies creates significant risks. For example,
several nuclear-weapon states rely on commercial technologies and
components procured abroad for sensitive nuclear operations, because
they are unable to manufacture high-tech components and computer chips.

[The development of cyber capabilities also has a **transformative
effect** on other weapons systems]{.underline}. The development of smart
weapons, such as ballistic missile defences or satellite weapons, [will
have an impact on **nuclear thinking and strategies**.]{.underline}
These new technologies may offer opportunities for \"deterrence by
denial\": designed to intercept missiles or warheads after launch, they
can also be used to prevent nuclear weapons systems from functioning as
intended. [This raises important questions for nuclear security,
thinking and strategy: the ability of states to target adversary targets
vulnerable to missile shields, the role of advanced technologies as a
non-nuclear counterforce]{.underline}, the risks of dual-use
technologies, the use of artificial intelligence (AI), etc. While AI can
assist in decision-making, the RAND Corporation points to its powerful
destabilizing potential. AI will strengthen the intelligence
capabilities of the most advanced states, weakening \"nuclear
deterrence\" and accelerating decision-making in nuclear crises.

Thus, the new cyber threat [poses significant risks to the very
**principle of \"nuclear deterrence**\".]{.underline} As a key element
of future conflicts, [**offensive cyber capabilities**, which give the
advantage to the attacker rather than the defender, will **increase
tensions** in times of crisis and could have important consequences for
strategic stability, **requiring a radical rethinking** of established
nuclear concepts.]{.underline}

The risks to nuclear command-and-control systems and to information and
early warning systems could render the nuclear order inoperative in a
crisis. [In the case of both AI and cyber-attacks, the mere existence of
such means of attack could **undermine confidence** in nuclear weapons
systems and **call into question** the nuclear second-strike capability.
Fear of losing the ability to retaliate could make states feel so
vulnerable that they might be tempted to take pre-emptive
action.]{.underline} These risks are heightened by the fact that several
of the nuclear-weapon states maintain their nuclear forces on permanent
alert, and launch times are becoming increasingly shorter. [The
development of offensive cyber capabilities could thus disrupt the
traditional scale of escalation: states could be made vulnerable at any
time by their enemies -- state or non-state -- and a "permanent state of
rivalry" would be created.]{.underline}

According to Futter, these developments could have serious consequences
for nuclear deterrence based on second-strike capability and the fear of
mutually assured destruction. The potential use of cyber capabilities as
precursors to delay or disrupt defensive systems before conducting a
strategic attack introduces the risk that systems could be compromised
and therefore not function as intended. States would then reintroduce
the possibility of preemptive strikes against nuclear weapons or
associated systems.

[These cyber capabilities will also have an impact on the likelihood
of]{.underline} a future nuclear arms reduction agreement, as well as on
**[nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**, because any arms reduction
agreement could increase the influence of cyber threats. [Cyber weapons
thus represent a serious and growing counterforce risk and create a
cyber security dilemma in terms of which nuclear-weapon states must
assume that their national security infrastructure has been targeted.
This leads to a growing incentive for these states to adapt their
nuclear policies towards \"preventive deterrence\" based on \"deterrence
by denial\" rather than \"deterrence by punishment\". The sanctity of
nuclear norms is thus being entirely reassessed, raising fears of a
lowering of the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[We were principally concerned with whether technologies that improve
the discriminate and precise application of smart conventional weapons
could **decrease reliance on nuclear weapons** for strategic tasks and
even, perhaps, make the substitution of nuclear weapons (**by
conventional capabilities) more feasible**.]{.underline} Experts and
policymakers generally agreed that it is not likely that emerging
technologies will substitute nuclear weapons in carrying out strategic
tasks. However, among the experts whom we surveyed there was a slight
variation depending on their region. Experts who were the most skeptical
of cyber supplanting nuclear weapons in carrying out strategic tasks
came from the United States, followed by those in Europe. By contrast,
around 60% of those experts belonging to the category "Other" seemed to
believe that cyber capabilities are likely to replace nuclear weapons in
carrying out strategic tasks (see Table 2).

[Decision-makers whom we interviewed tended to agree with experts from
the United States and Europe. One interviewee reasoned that when it
comes to trying to guarantee a strategic outcome, cyber is **not the
best capability** because it is still far too complex and there is still
much we do not know]{.underline} (Interviewee A). [Another interviewee
agreed saying that cyber is "**not designed to be a strategic
weapon**"]{.underline} (Interviewee F). [Other respondents agreed that
new technologies are not likely to supplant nuclear weapons in carrying
out strategic tasks simply because nuclear weapons have such a
significant place in international politics and play such a pivotal,
central role in deterrence. On this point, one interviewee remarked that
the **very debate that we have** over nuclear weapons "is a
**vindication of the importance of nuclear weapons** in politics and
society]{.underline}" (Interviewee K). [Another interviewee stated that
the "horrifying stigma" around nuclear weapons evokes a certain
respectability for the weapons as an effective deterrent]{.underline}
(Interviewee L). [This is particularly true when it comes to the role of
nuclear weapons in deterrence by punishment, which elevates the costs of
attack]{.underline} (Mazarr, 2018). [Moreover, another policymaker
stated that there is a conservative, doctrinal and institutional vision
in their country that sees **nuclear weapons as essential** in the
country's strategic thinking, making it very difficult to "relativize
their importance" (Interviewee D).]{.underline}

[Policymakers generally agreed that the sheer destructiveness of nuclear
weapons, which is---in the minds of experts and policy elites---assured
and certain, makes them different from any other
technology.]{.underline} These views come close to arguments outlined by
Ford (2010), who argued that nuclear weapons are uniquely well-suited
for both counterforce and countervalue targeting. Other experts,
particularly those versed in cyber technology, pointed to a curious
contradiction: [The effectiveness of **offensive cyber weapons** is
**unclear** unless they are tested, but as soon as they are used, the
gaps they exploit might be patched up.]{.underline}

#### Shared cyber [shifts]{.underline} US planning away from [kinetic]{.underline} forces

[Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional
arms]{.underline} and less like national assets also [helps]{.underline}
[drive]{.underline} the integration of cyber operations into the
**[planning and execution of]{.underline}** a **[broader]{.underline}**
array of **[conventional military missions]{.underline}**. Early cyber
operations were largely conventional espionage and surveillance
activities supercharged by the spread of computing and the internet. In
the United States, this led to the creation of large and complex
software tools, carefully guarded by the intelligence community as
national assets (sometimes unsuccessfully). The DoD's announcement
indicates a move towards treating at least some of these capabilities,
along with their supporting infrastructure, more like conventional
armaments and making them available for broader use; a model closer to
Central or Special Operations Command and less like the National
Security Agency. The Pentagon's new commitment also reflects changes in
how Europe talks about cybersecurity and characterizes the Russian
threat. The last two years have seen a trend toward more open discussion
of offensive cyber operations and the possibility of the alliance
adopting more assertive postures to counter cyber operations against its
members. After years of devastating ransomware attacks and cyber-enabled
information attacks, NATO members are more willing to explore cyber
triggers to Article 5. They have also been more willing to articulate
the cyber threat against the alliance. In addition to last week's
denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities, Russian state actors
are widely suggested to be responsible for an increasingly brazen series
of operations, including targeting German government ministries, French
and British TV stations, and more. [Sharing offensive cyber capabilities
**raises the question** of whether cyber operations can extend effective
deterrence to NATO partners]{.underline}. There seems to be little focus
on using these operations to deter conventional or nuclear attacks on
NATO countries, but this may evolve. The United States seems to want
NATO to use cyber operations to deter other cyber operations,
particularly those falling under the threshold of armed conflict. [Cyber
operations have **all sorts of problems for deterrence**: signaling is
difficult, they can be perceived as a cheap threat, and their effects
are largely uncertain]{.underline}. [By contrast, moving new military
forces in Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are credible
signals of extended deterrence, but are costly and time
consuming]{.underline}. **[Cyber capabilities]{.underline}**
**[are]{.underline}**n't free, nor are they necessarily cheap, but the
promise to use them can add new credibility to a deterrent threat
without the same investment and delay as **[conventional]{.underline}**
**[alternatives]{.underline}**. Sharing cyber capabilities may be a
cheaper way to signal alliance commitment than other options and might
signal a further maturation, and acceptance, of cybersecurity into
geopolitics.

### L - Deescalation

#### **Pursuing [deescalatory]{.underline} measures sends [negative messages]{.underline} about assurance to allies**

**Guillot 19** (W. Michael Guillot - retired USAF Colonel with
experience in Strategic Air Command, "Why De-escalation Is Bad Policy",
Strategic Studies Quarterly, Volume 13 Number 3, Pages 3-4, Fall 2019,
MG)

[When leaders profess their desire to perpetually de-escalate
provocations and crises, the message received by our adversaries is that
the United States **lacks credibility** and fears
confrontation.]{.underline} During the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the
United States appeared too concerned about or fearful of escalation
rather than showing conviction to solve a conflict on terms aligned with
democratic interests and values. Recently, in response to Iran's
provocation, a senior US lawmaker stated that we must "do everything in
our power to de-escalate." The same sentiment was evident in former
secretary of state John Kerry's response to Russian actions in Syria.
This fear of escalation is also seen in interactions between US Navy
ships in the South China Sea and the so-called China maritime fleet,
which signals weakness in "respect based" cultures. Another example is
the US reaction to the situation in Ukraine. While this scenario
continues to unfold, our initial response was to limit assistance to
nonlethal aid for fear of escalation. In each of these examples, and
many others, [adversaries have learned to prey on US de-escalatory
tendencies and rely on our timid reactions.]{.underline}

[The result is a slow, insidious decline in perceived US credibility and
resolve when it is confronted with clear violations of international law
and threats of direct aggression]{.underline}. Some scholars argue that
states should avoid confrontations that attempt to preserve their
credibility while others argue in favor of it, particularly during
noncrises. [A policy of escalation helps preserve credibility to avoid
fighting wars. But US credibility is not the only casualty of
de-escalation as policy; it also affects US alliances.]{.underline}

[A policy of de-escalation sends a **negative message to our allies
about US assurances**---even more so than some current political
messages.]{.underline} Such assurances are critical to the American
alliance system, and research suggests that reliable nations make better
alliance partners. [We have seen examples of negative assurances in the
past, particularly whether the United States would live up to its
**nuclear commitments** during the Cold War. **Would we trade New York
for Berlin**? Without assurances from the United States, **the system
itself may well fracture**, allowing for more of the types of aggression
ongoing in the Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe.]{.underline} To be sure,
there remains a risk of entanglement in a crisis created by allies, but
being willing to escalate seems more likely to help prevent its
occurrence.

[Without a willingness to escalate, alliances become **meaningless
commitments** and the world becomes **a more dangerous
place**.]{.underline} In a recent Foreign Policy article, Eldridge Colby
writes about the key to Chinese and Russian success in a great power
conflict. His prescription: restraint by Washington. De-escalation is
the culprit in what Colby describes as the "fait accompli." Particularly
in the Baltic States, de-escalation messages create doubt among our
allies as to whether the United States considers escalation worth the
risk, or cost. The same could be said for Chinese actions to forcefully
reclaim Taiwan or control the sea-lanes of the Indo-Pacific.

[Without question, the greatest problem with a policy of de-escalation
is the impression it sends to our adversaries. Over the past few years,
US policy makers have instinctively looked to de-escalate crises at all
costs--- from China to Syria to Iran. The result has been Russian
aggression in Syria, Georgia, and Ukraine; Chinese island fortifications
that threaten freedom of navigation; Iranian attacks in the Middle East;
and North Korean threats in Southeast Asia. Thus, the very word
escalation seems to have **created fear** among some US decision makers
and scholars.]{.underline}

### L - Drones

#### **Drone cooperation [exacerbates]{.underline} questions of assurance and creates risks of [entrapment]{.underline} and [aggression]{.underline}**

**Mehta 19** (Rupal N. Mehta PhD - Associate Professor in the Department
of Political Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, "Extended
deterrence and assurance in an emerging technology environment", Journal
of Strategic Studies, 3 June 2019,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390.2019.1621173>, MG)

Despite these potential benefits[, it is not immediately clear how
allies are likely to respond to the incorporation of unmanned systems to
their defence. Due in part of these characteristics (seen as
advantageous to the US), allies may be less convinced of their utility.
Unlike military personnel or hard forward-deployed assets which are much
harder to redeploy, **drones can be shifted** to counter more prescient
threats and potentially produce uncertainty among allies about US
commitment. Second, as drones reduce the risk to US personnel, allies
may, potentially incorrectly, view this as a **reduction in the US's
willingness to experience risk** in defence of its allies and partners.
As concerns over '**risking Tokyo for New York'** persisted in the
nuclear age, perceptions of risk and commitment as shifted by unmanned
weapons systems may similarly exacerbate questions of assurance. From
the allied perspective, the strength of the US commitment may
increasingly be in doubt]{.underline}. Thus, we may find limited support
for Hypothesis 3.

[Further, uncertainty in the US commitment, as a result of emerging
technology, has the opportunity to encourage **riskier behaviour** among
allies. Concerns over moral hazard and agency loss persist in
discussions of the nuclear umbrella]{.underline} and while generally
seen to be lower than hypothesised, [these concerns may grow in a new
emerging technology environment where US credibility is seen to
waver.]{.underline}56 Consider then how allies are likely to respond in
this strategic engagement. [Allies may invest in **more offensive
capabilities** that could have important implications for conflict
dynamics. Allies may seek to engage or deter adversaries on their own,
potentially in contravention to broader alliance principles, and have
the ability to involve or **entrap** the United States in undesirable
conflicts.]{.underline}

[In aggregate, an examination of the inclusion of drones in extended
deterrence suggests that while attractive to American policymakers and
civilians in defending allies, their use may produce unforeseen and
potentially negative consequences in attempting to assure
allies,]{.underline} revealing preliminary support for the hypotheses
introduced earlier. The case vignette below similarly tracks these
hypotheses in the context of hypersonic boostglide vehicles.

### L - Hypersonics

#### **Hypersonics cooperative development [alienates]{.underline} allies and [risks war]{.underline} with Russia and China**

**Mehta 19** (Rupal N. Mehta PhD - Associate Professor in the Department
of Political Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, "Extended
deterrence and assurance in an emerging technology environment", Journal
of Strategic Studies, 3 June 2019,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390.2019.1621173>, MG)

[However, in considering]{.underline} Hypothesis 2 [-- the potential
benefit of emerging technology in deterring large-scale conflict but
potentially inviting small-scale disputes -- the emergence of hypersonic
glide vehicles gets somewhat more complex]{.underline}. Despite the
rhetoric and posture aimed at third parties (such as North Korea) that
pose threats to its allies[, the US's two primary adversaries, Russia
and China, view the **development** of CPGS and hypersonic weaponry as
**destabilising**, prone to miscalculation, and potential escalation.
This emerging technology may produce **more risk than deterrent value**
and increase both the likelihood of smaller-scale crises, as well as
large-scale conflicts.62]{.underline}

[Importantly, it is this concern that highlights why allies may be less
assured by the inclusion of this capability in the broader extended
deterrent arsenal. Worried about being caught as collateral damage in a
fight between major powers such as Russia and China against the United
States, allies may fear that even conventional-only hypersonic vehicles
may **increase the risk of conflict** to unacceptable levels --
producing uncertainty about whether they would actually be used in
combat.]{.underline} This concern about the actual likelihood of use
mirrors that in the conversations over nuclear use. Most allies are
uncertain as to whether the United States would actually invoke nuclear
weapons in their defence for fear of escalation.63 [If hypersonic glide
vehicles produce the same cycles of miscalculation, strategic
instability and uncertainty, they are unlikely to serve as useful
complements to extended deterrence.64]{.underline}

Second, if we consider this dynamic from the opposing perspective,
[allies may be concerned about the efficacy and credibility of the US
extended deterrent, in the context of hypersonic weaponry.
In]{.underline} contrast to the United States whose development of
hypersonic vehicles is primarily conventional, both Russia and China are
projected to have 'upped the ante' by developing capabilities for
nuclear delivery as well.65 Allied observers of this progress may be
increasingly concerned about the asymmetry between the US capability and
that of its two significant adversaries. [As with other forms of
uncertainty, allies may again begin to question their reliance on US's
extended deterrent, and potentially **seek their own offensive
capabilities** to counter these new threats. Further, uncertainty about
escalation management may encourage other forms of behaviour that
diverge from alliance preferences. These dynamics may produce negative
repercussions for broader regional and international stability -- namely
by encouraging allies to take up riskier behaviour that **increases the
likelihood of conflict**. As with other instances of moral hazard in the
nuclear arena, there are concerns that allies may effectively threaten
efforts at strategic stability.]{.underline}

As both vignettes illustrate, through preliminary examinations of the
four hypotheses discussed earlier, [the introduction of emerging
technologies into the extended deterrence and assurance equation
produces a whole host of complex and unforeseen
implications]{.underline}. Seemingly non-uniform in their broader
effects, more research is required to assess how exactly these
technologies may enhance the US's ability to provide deterrence to
distant allies, while still maintaining credibility in its commitments.

### L -- SC -- Troop Reduction

#### Security cooperation with NATO is used domestically to justify troop reductions

(Adam, "GOVERNANCE: THE MISSING INGREDIENT IN SECURITY COOPERATION,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1038564.pdf)//BB>

[It is a U.S. government held position that **SC**]{.underline}/SA
[programs reduce the need for **U.S. boots on the ground**]{.underline}
during conflicts.28 [After host nation forces are trained, U.S. partners
have greater]{.underline} [capacity and independence, which **reduces
the need** **for**]{.underline} the **[presence]{.underline}** of U.S.
soldiers. [During the Cold War, there were "over half a million U.S.
personnel assigned in the European theater]{.underline}."29 [Today, the
U.S. commitment has been reduced]{.underline} by more than 85 percent.
30 [This is, in part, due to]{.underline} the existence of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) and the military
posture of **[allied forces in the region,]{.underline}** thereby
**[reducing the need for a massive U.S. force]{.underline}**. As
Congress enacts end-strength reductions for all of the services, [the
goal is to build partner capacity to "operate]{.underline} alongside or
**[instead of U.S. military forces]{.underline}**."31

#### Troop withdrawal triggers assurance collapse

Alexander **Lanoszka 19**, assistant professor of international
relations at the University of Waterloo and an honorary fellow at City,
University of London, 6-11-2019, \"False Alarm? Donald Trump, Alliances
and Nuclear Proliferation,\" East West,
https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/false-alarm-donald-trump-alliances-and-nuclear-proliferation

[Some observers argue the prospects for nuclear proliferation among U.S.
allies appear to have heightened in recent years]{.underline}.
Superficially, U.S. President Donald Trump may be responsible. During
his 2016 presidential campaign, he made statements suggesting he might
tolerate efforts by Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons.
His criticisms of NATO and some of its members have fueled debate in
Germany on the desirability and feasibility of the "nuclear option."
Looking more broadly, since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. has had
to grapple with the management of its security ties abroad amid mounting
budgetary deficits and growing public weariness of so-called "forever
wars." [And yet, over [two years into]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration, [little]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration-related
activity [seems to be taking place]{.mark} among U.S.
allies]{.underline}. In [fact, some of the most powerful U.S.
allies---Japan and Germany---have largely moved away from nuclear
energy]{.underline}. What lies behind this current scenario? **[Perhaps
[one answer is that the U.S military deployments that underscore]{.mark}
U.S. security [commitments remain strong]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But how
do security guarantees relate to nuclear proliferation? Presidential
rhetoric may be important for evaluating the strength of a treaty pledge
by the U.S. to defend an ally in the event of attack by a potential
adversary like Russia, North Korea or China. However, whether it is more
important than other considerations is debatable, since presidential
rhetoric may simply be just that: rhetoric. A verbally cited promise to
follow through on any pledges recorded in print is simply hard to
believe. No country wants to risk the safety of his or her country's
cities for an ally, if they can help it. How can a state, therefore,
have any sort of confidence in its alliances? Thankfully, there is a
way. [The U.S. deploys a wide range of military forces to shore up local
defense and deterrence measures to augment the security of its allies
and to advance its own national security interests]{.underline}. U.S.
forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, for example, are there for
regional contingency if North Korea and/or China were to commit an act
of aggression---not to serve as potential targets to trigger wider
retaliation by Washington, per the logic of trip-wires. They are also
there to kill, making it hard for any potential aggressor to go
successfully on the attack without incurring unacceptable costs. [**[So
long as the U.S. has]{.mark} such [forces on its ally's
territory]{.mark}, or in the theater of operations where a potential war
would be fought, [the]{.mark} security [guarantee is
sufficient]{.mark}ly strong [to have]{.mark} the [confidence of its
beneficiaries.]{.mark}** It is when the U.S. has unilaterally reduced
its forward deployments that its allies become so alarmed they are
tempted to acquire nuclear weapons to ensure their own security. A case
in point is South Korea in the 1970s.]{.underline} As it does now, South
Korea benefited from a treaty promising that Washington would defend it
against external aggression. But when President Richard Nixon came into
office in 1969, he spoke of how partners in East Asia and elsewhere
would need to bear more of the collective defense burden, especially in
light of its failures in Vietnam, rising anti-war sentiment at home and
the downturn in the U.S. economy. Yet, the South Korean President at the
time---Park Chung-hee---was unfazed by Nixon's rhetoric. He believed
that the United States would reward his country for its contributions in
the Vietnam War by retaining its large military presence on the Korean
Peninsula. President Park's optimism was misplaced. In July 1970, Nixon
announced that the U.S. would unilaterally withdraw 20,000 of its
military personnel from South Korea within a year, cutting the total
U.S. military presence on the peninsula by one-third. The balance of
power implications were potentially significant. Since more troop
reductions were now conceivable, South Korea would become newly
vulnerable to North Korea---an adversary that, at the time, was
relatively more industrialized, enjoyed Chinese and Soviet patronage,
had a stronger conventional military and had engaged in highly
provocative but low-level military activities across the Demilitarized
Zone against the South since 1966. Against this backdrop, President Park
put South Korea on the path towards acquiring nuclear weapons. This
project failed partly because South Korea needed outside sources for
credit and access to reprocessing and enrichment facilities---a
vulnerability that the United States used to its advantage to get its
ally to curb its activities and to make nonproliferation commitments.
Still, South Korea has had persistent interest in fissile materials
since the 1970s and continues to undertake continued pyroprocessing
activities. Today, South Korea may not be on an aggressive path to
acquiring nuclear weapons, but its apparent desire to seek some
advantage demonstrates that security guarantees---once broken---can be
very difficult to repair, thus prompting countries to reconsider the
nuclear option. The South Korean case illuminates why we are seeing no
new efforts to get nuclear weapons, at least by U.S. treaty allies, in
the age of Trump. When one looks beyond the rhetoric, actions speak
volumes. The Trump administration has reinforced U.S. force posture with
additional deployments to Germany. It is seriously considering a
permanent military presence in neighboring Poland. Present relations
with South Korea have been rocky, but the Trump administration did sign
an updated free trade agreement, as well as a temporary agreement, to
help cover the costs of 28,500 military personnel stationed there. The
U.S. military presence in Japan has remained steady. Indeed, if Trump is
serious about containing China, the U.S. military presence will likely
increase in East Asia over the long-term. [Dramatic, unilateral troop
withdrawals under the Trump administration are still possible, but the
historical record indicates that such attempts are generally made early
in a presidency rather than later. Nixon, for instance, announced his
troop withdrawal out of Vietnam within eighteen months of coming into
office. **Putting all rhetoric aside, [if the military
foundations]{.mark} of U.S. security guarantees [remain strong]{.mark},
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [among allies remains
unlikely.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### L - DoD Tradeoff

#### Funding for US nuclear modernization is stable now

"Biden team weighs killing Trump's new nuclear weapons: Officials are
considering canceling weapons that were backed by the last
administration.," Politico,

(accessed 4-26-2022)

But the [final deliberations are coming into view]{.underline}. "I think
[we'll probably see]{.underline}, certainly, a shift back towards the
tone and tenor of the 2010 NPR," said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank
Klotz, who co-authored a new study on the nuclear triad for the
government-funded RAND Corp. But that also likely means [sticking to the
major overhaul of the nuclear triad that was underwritten in the Obama
administration]{.underline} and is estimated to cost \$634 billion over
the next decade. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [added to that
modernization push by authorizing at least three new weapon systems and
upgraded warheads, including a cruise missile and a smaller warhead for
subs]{.underline}. Critics argue such less destructive weapons are more
destabilizing because they are more likely to be used in a conflict than
weapons that can obliterate entire cities. Biden, however, has been
under pressure from some Democrats in Congress to reconsider the
development of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, which is set to
replace the Minuteman III ICBMs that are located in underground silos
across five Western states. The administration decided to forgo a
request from the offices of Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.) to study whether the current missiles could be operated
longer, according to a pair of congressional staffers. [A
Pentagon-ordered unclassified study on the future of the]{.underline}
ICBM [force]{.underline} commissioned by the Pentagon last month [isn't
expected to recommend major changes]{.underline} to the missile
replacement program, which was awarded to Northrop Grumman in 2020. "[I
don't think it's going to be Earth-shattering]{.underline} in any way,"
said George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and the lead author of the study. [The
Biden nuclear review is also not expected to propose changes
to]{.underline} the development of [a new fleet of Columbia-class
ballistic missile submarines]{.underline} under construction by General
Dynamics, or the B-21 stealth bomber also being built by Northrop
Grumman. "Many of [the same programs]{.underline}, many of [the same
policies will remain the same]{.underline}," [predicted Klotz, who ran
the National Nuclear Security Administration]{.underline} at the
Department of Energy, which builds the nuclear warheads, from 2014 to
2018. [He said he expects "some changes on the margin]{.underline} to
indicate they have looked seriously at \[potential reforms\], [but I
expect the fundamental tenets of the nuclear modernization program to
continue pretty much as they have since they were first conceived in the
Obama administration]{.underline}."

#### Security Cooperation squanders finite resources needed for other military projects

SC does work to build capacity in certain, relatively elite units that
perceive a real need for improvement and hard training. Likewise, it
works to build interoperability between already-capable partner forces
and U.S. and coalition militaries. SC in the right doses can be a good
way of showing solidarity with allies against other regional threats.
But [SC \[Security Cooperation\] is not a panacea and must be applied
with significantly more discernment than the usual
some-is-good-more-is-better logic of U.S. military
spending]{.underline}. Planners should go to great lengths to ensure
that SC is seen as a tool for a specific purpose, not a reward to
condition behaviors. SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery with
diminishing returns. If policymakers want a quid pro quo, they need to
admit as much and use much more precisely targeted incentives: paying a
fee for access or head-of-the-line transit privileges for example. This
becomes a much more predictable business transaction than trying to use
SC funds, winks, and nudges to get one's way. Finally, [in the land of
perverse incentives, SC is often seen as a means to drive defense
business to U.S. contractors. This is true. By creating arms
races]{.underline} and supplying prestige weapons, however useless, to
unstable areas of the world, [they are creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't
taxpayer money and efforts be better spent if officials more precisely
targeted]{.underline} domestic [concerns]{.underline} with taxpayer
funds [rather than hoping that efforts trickle down
predictably]{.underline} from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory
foreign generals? [In the land of perverse incentives, SC funding is one
of the most egregious]{.underline}---and in the post-9/11 era, many
officials see SC as a critical tool of strategic positioning. However,
[the premises of SC must be reconsidered before the U.S. military
squanders more resources on white elephant projects]{.underline}.

#### Spending tradeoffs are most likely to come from US nuclear modernization

But [national security officials are debating whether to jettison a new
nuclear-armed cruise missile]{.underline} now in the research phase,
[retire a]{.underline} Cold War-era [thermonuclear bomb, and possibly
even remove a new "low-yield" warhead]{.underline} that the previous
administration deployed on submarines, the current and former officials
said. Most spoke on condition they not be identified in order to discuss
internal deliberations and private conversations. Such changes would
fall short of the overhaul of nuclear policy and programs that President
Joe Biden has long argued would help blunt a nuclear arms race, namely a
declaration that the United States would not be the first to strike an
adversary using atomic weapons. Yet [halting the Trump-era
"add-ons,"]{.underline} as they are called, [are]{.underline} considered
[the most likely cuts if Biden wants to reverse]{.underline} the
previous administration's [elevation of nuclear weapons in U.S.
strategy]{.underline}, due to resistance from military leaders to big
changes as Russia and China build up their arsenals. "The Biden
administration's problem or challenge, of course, is how can it show
that it is doing something on reductions or reforms without
[undercutting the modernization program]{.underline} that was set in
motion by \[former President Barack\] Obama," said Hans Kristensen,
director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of
American Scientists. He said some of the newer weapons approved by
former President Donald Trump [are "the low-hanging fruit,]{.underline}"
particularly a new nuclear-armed cruise missile for the Navy.

#### Triggers allied proliferation

(accessed 5-17-2022)

[US nuclear weapons play a special role in underpinning international
peace, global security, and the US-led, rules-based international
system. The nuclear threat to the United States and its democratic
allies is growing: nuclear-armed, revisionist, autocratic
powers]{.underline} (Russia, China, and North Korea) [are relying more
on nuclear weapons in their strategies, and they are modernizing and
expanding their arsenals]{.underline}. In this new issue brief, the
Scowcroft Center's Matthew Kroenig explains why [the United States needs
to retain a robust, flexible, and modernized nuclear force to meet its
national security objectives]{.underline}. US nuclear weapons are
special for three reasons [US nuclear weapons are unique for three
reasons. First, the United States extends nuclear deterrence to more
than thirty formal treaty allies]{.underline} in Europe and the
Indo-Pacific, [a central pillar of US alliances and the rules-based
international system. Second, US counterforce targeting keeps the United
States in compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict and potentially
allows the United States to limit the damage from nuclear war and save
millions of lives]{.underline}. [Finally, the United States has enjoyed
the economic capacity to field a robust nuclear force at a reasonable
cost. In sum, the United States demands more of its nuclear weapons than
other countries and requires a more robust force]{.underline}. [The
international security environment is deteriorating]{.underline} The
United States' three nuclear-armed [adversaries]{.underline}---Russia,
China, and North Korea---[are all modernizing and expanding their
nuclear arsenals while consistently relying more on nuclear weapons in
their defense strategies]{.underline}. Even as it complies with the
letter of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the
Kremlin is building new, exotic and battlefield weapons not covered in
the Treaty's text. [China's rise has paved the way for its assertive and
revisionist foreign policy, which poses the greatest threat to US
national security and the US-led, rules-based international system.
China's nuclear forces may]{.underline} double within the next decade,
or even triple or [quadruple]{.underline}. [North Korea has become the
third US adversary with the ability to hold the US homeland at risk with
the threat of nuclear war]{.underline}.

a dual dynamic of deterrence and reassurance. The dominant ally needs to
take actions that deter the adversary and reassure its weaker ally. Of
the two, reassurance is often more difficult than deterrence, especially
when the dynamic plays out in the nuclear realm. [For while the
adversary may be deterred by even a small chance that conflict escalates
to nuclear confrontation, the ally will be reassured **only** if it
believes there is a high likelihood that the stronger partner will come
to its defense. In other words, because its security is dependent on the
actions of another power, an ally will always worry about its possible
abandonment in time of need.]{.underline}

[The changing security environment characterized by **Russia's return,
China's rise, North Korea's advance, and America's retreat** accentuates
the deterrence-reassurance dilemma in a new form for America's European
and Asian allies.]{.underline} For the first time in decades, it [raises
new challenges for the long-ignored nuclear dimension of their security
relationships]{.underline}. Although renewed discussions about nuclear
deterrence and reassurance have so far played out largely beyond public
view inmost allied countries, [the issue is becoming increasingly
salient as the perceived threats to security have increased. The United
States and its allies **cannot ignore that reality**. For if we are to
prevent **new nuclear proliferation** among these allies, it is
essential to acknowledge that what has long been unthinkable is becoming
**thinkable once more**.]{.underline}

#### **The US' commitment credibility specifically is the brightline for potential proliferators**

of Political Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, "Delaying
Doomsday", Bridging the Gap, Page 53-54, 2020, MG)

Second, questions of credibility and reputation have resurged in the
modern geo-strategic era.60 [Decline in U.S.  reputation in the
twenty-first century has been **exacerbated** after a series of foreign
policy failures (e.g., the Iraq War in 2003, the creation of failed
redlines in Syria in 2013), and potentially worse, the idiosyncratic
"America First" foreign policy of the Trump Administration that even
extols the **benefits of nuclear proliferation**. If adversaries and
allies alike **mistrust** the United States and its commitment to both
the nonproliferation regime and existing alliances, concerns will
continue to escalate about whether the U.S. would be willing to
**actually abide by a nuclear**]{.underline} **[agreement]{.underline}**
and provide the promised inducements from negotiations or forgo threats
of military force if the proliferator actually complies. [If
proliferators or other actors in the international community doubt the
United States' credibility, **proliferators** on the cusp of nuclear
reversal may question whether they should proceed with their planned
denuclearization.]{.underline} Future research may choose to relax these
assumptions and assess whether the same theoretical mechanisms are as
salient in a new geopolitical environment where state (and specifically
leader) credibility is up to debate.

Role of Non-U.S. Actors: Other Superpowers and Regional Adversaries

The theoretical framework in this book focuses primarily on the role of
the United States as the key actor involved in nuclear negotiations.
This is not without reason. [First, its role as the **head of the
nonproliferation** (and thus counterproliferation) regime is generally
unequivocal. Since the introduction of nuclear weapons in the
international system in 1945 (by the United States), the U.S. scientific
and policy communities, as well as policymakers and heads of states,
have done their utmost to both manage and curtail the spread of nuclear
technology throughout the international system.61 Second, as discussed
throughout this study, the United States has traditionally been both the
**primary donor** of positive inducements and imposer of sanctions and
other negative inducements. This is true not just within the nuclear
arena but often with regard to human rights violations, terrorism, or
other security threats posed by external adversaries. Third, and
relatedly, the United States, **as the global hegemon**, often has the
most to lose from proliferation challenges to the status quo. As leader
of the international world order, threats posed by proliferators to
adapt or alter "the nuclear club" hold significant costs for the U.S.,
both in terms of security and with regard to its interests
globally.62]{.underline}

### I/L -- Nuke Commitment Key

#### **US Nuclear-based commitment is the [only]{.underline} one that assures allies -- anything else enables [proliferation]{.underline}**

[Extending deterrence against regional risk-taking states in possession
of limited nuclear arsenals -- or determined to develop these weapons --
requires the United States to clearly demonstrate it possesses **nuclear
forces** capable of imposing "unacceptable costs"]{.underline} against
any actor contemplating a nuclear attack against a U.S. ally or
partner.64 While each leg of the U.S. nuclear triad possesses this
capability, **[nuclear-capable]{.underline}** aircraft (bombers and
dual-capable aircraft (DCA)) [are particularly important to extended
deterrence against this type of opponent. In response to nuclear
saber-rattling by a risk-taking state with a limited nuclear arsenal,
the United States can rapidly fly these delivery systems into the region
in question, showing this state -- and local U.S. allies -- that it can
immediately respond to any provocation with superior nuclear
capabilities.65]{.underline}

[U.S. nuclear forces are also **essential** to the assurance of allies
and partners]{.underline}. Other than the United Kingdom and France, no
U.S. ally or partner openly possesses their own nuclear arsenal[. As a
result, many allies and partners are entirely dependent upon the United
States for the provision of a nuclear deterrent against potential
adversaries armed with nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The importance of
this fact -- which is a day-to-day reality for many U.S. friends abroad
-- cannot be overemphasized; [for these states, the **only weapon** they
view as fully effective against nuclear coercion or attack is not in
their possession.]{.underline}66 [This highlights the importance of the
U.S. "nuclear umbrella" to **nuclear nonproliferation efforts**; it is
vital for the United States to convince allies and partners they have
**no need** to consider developing their own, independent nuclear
deterrent.67]{.underline}

[Within the U.S. nuclear arsenal, allies and partners particularly value
visible and mobile U.S. nuclear forces.68]{.underline} As noted above,
within current U.S. nuclear forces these characteristics are associated
with nuclear-capable aircraft. U.S. allies and partners recognize the
United States can also deliver nuclear payloads globally with
submarinelaunched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs). [Many find greater assurance, however, in
forces they can **directly observe stationed or forward deployed** on
their territory, or regularly rotating in theater. They also share the
U.S. conviction that the rapid, visible generation or deployment of U.S.
nuclear forces can prevent nuclear-armed potential adversaries from
engaging in nuclear brinkmanship.]{.underline}

Planners and strategists must demonstrate to allies, partners, and
potential adversaries that U.S. nuclear forces are not solely restricted
to central deterrence. Potential adversaries must also recognize that
the United States is capable of rapidly matching any type of nuclear
provocation or escalation. In addition, U.S. strategists and planners
need to balance allied requests for nuclear forces sufficient to deter
and defeat prospective opponents against allied concerns regarding the
potential consequences of nuclear conflict (such as fallout drifting
across their borders). [At present, due to the threats posed by
risk-taker states, the role of nuclear airpower is critically important
to a range of U.S. extended deterrence and assurance
strategies.]{.underline} As such, strategists and planners must
understand the unique (and differing) capabilities and requirements of
bombers, DCA, and the warheads they can deliver.

#### **[Only]{.underline} nuclear solves deterrence and assurance**

**Wheeler 10** (Michael O. Wheeler -- Colonel and Staff Secretary to the
National Security Council, "The Changing Requirements of Assurance and
Extended Deterrence", Institute for Defense Analysis, July 2010,

Background. When this project began in 2007, it was not common practice
to encounter American officials publicly discussing assurance and
extended deterrence. In fact, as nuclear security became less of a
central feature of great power relations after the Cold War, it was
unusual to encounter much discussion of any nuclear deterrence issues at
high levels of government. [Today, however, the nuclear dimension of
extended deterrence is a much more highly visible part of the security
debate, and figures prominently in statements by cabinet
officials]{.underline} and, indeed, by the Vice President and President.
The following elements of the evolving policy environment since the
project began are especially relevant to this paper.

[The Schlesinger Task Force.]{.underline} An unauthorized transfer of
nuclear weapons by the Air Force in 2007 and the subsequent discovery
that intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) components had been
shipped to Taiwan by mistake a year earlier, triggered a series of
investigations and reports. [In June 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates appointed the Task Force on Nuclear Weapons Management chaired by
James R. Schlesinger to recommend improvements and measures to enhance
deterrence and international confidence in the U.S. nuclear
deterrent.]{.underline}

[**The Schlesinger task force** produced two reports.9 Among other
things, the task force concluded that U.S. nuclear capabilities in
Europe, although modest in numbers, remain a "**pillar of NATO** \[North
Atlantic Treaty Organization\] unity."10 The task force also stressed
the importance of **extended nuclear deterrence** as a non-proliferation
tool.]{.underline} In a press conference at the Pentagon in January
2008, Dr. Schlesinger stated that, 11 [the United States is obligated to
provide a nuclear umbrella for 30-plus nations, and that number may
increase. Thus, those 30 nations must retain confidence in the U.S.
nuclear umbrella. If they fail to do so, some **five or six** of those
nations are quite capable of beginning to produce nuclear weapons on
their own, and the consequence is to add to proliferation. The strength
of the U.S. nuclear umbrella, the credibility of that umbrella, is a
**principal barrier to proliferation**.]{.underline}

This has become a standard, non-partisan theme in the contemporary
American security policy debate.

[**The Perry-Schlesinger Commission**.]{.underline} Under the
chairmanship of two former Secretaries of Defense, William J. Perry and
James R. Schlesinger, the Strategic Posture Commission (also known as
the Perry-Schlesinger Commission) was chartered by Congress in 2008 to
examine and make recommendations on the long-term strategic posture of
the United States. [In their final report, released in early 2009, the
Posture Commission provided a broad and comprehensive analysis of the
international nuclear order. The Commission concluded inter alia that
assuring allies remains a principal function of the U.S nuclear posture
and that the United States should expand consultations with allies
regarding such assurances.]{.underline}12 The Commission also found that
["assurance that extended deterrence remains credible and effective may
require that the United States retain numbers or types of **nuclear
capabilities** that it might not deem necessary if it were concerned
**only with its own defense**."]{.underline}13 Finally, relevant to this
discussion, the Commission also concluded that the United States "should
adapt its strategic posture to the evolving requirements of deterrence,
extended deterrence, and assurance."14

**[The Perry-Scowcroft Task Force]{.underline}**. In 2008, the Council
on Foreign Relations convened an independent task force chaired by
William J. Perry and Brent Scowcroft to examine U.S. nuclear weapons
policy. [In their consensus report released in 2009, the Perry-Scowcroft
task force concluded inter alia: The United States does not need nuclear
weapons to compensate for conventional military inferiority and has no
reason to fear a conventionally armed foe. But **U.S. allies, including
members of the NA TO alliance**, Australia, Japan, and South Korea,
depend on security assurances from the United States. A component of
these assurances is **protection against nuclear attack**. U.S. nuclear
weapons represent one facet of multilayered defenses---including
diplomacy, economic support, and conventional military forces---that
deter attacks and defend allies in the event of an attack. Without the
nuclear aspect of these assurances, some U.S. allies may decide in the
future to acquire nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The Task Force strongly
supports maintaining and enhancing, where necessary, U.S. security
assurances to allies (emphasis added).

#### **Only the [nuclear]{.underline} deterrence aspect of assurance prevents [proliferation]{.underline}**

**Trachtenberg 12** (David J. Trachtenberg - American national security
advisor who served as principal deputy under secretary for policy in the
United States Department of Defense, "US Extended Deterrence: How Much
Strategic Force Is Too Little?", Strategic Studies Quarterly Volume 6

<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-06_Issue-2/summer12.pdf>,
MG)

The Bush administration's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) postulated a
world of extant and emerging nuclear powers posing qualitatively
different nuclear threats to the United States and its allies than
existed during the Cold War. [While deterrence of nuclear attack
remained a **central goal** of US nuclear forces, its nuclear arsenal
was considered to play a broader role in ensuring global
security.]{.underline}

Along with traditional deterrence, the 2001 NPR articulated a role for
nuclear weapons in "assurance, dissuasion, and defeat"---concepts
previously posited in the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review. In other
words, the [NPR acknowledged that **US nuclear forces** play a major
role in providing security guarantees to friends and allies who lack
their own nuclear weapons and face challenges from hostile neighbors or
adversaries (i.e., assurance). The US nuclear potential was also seen as
having a dissuasive effect on adversaries who might contemplate actions
contrary to American interests. And, of course, should deterrence
fail---an increasingly plausible prospect in a world of rogue states and
terrorist actors---US nuclear forces **must have** the capacity to
defeat any aggressor. Without this capacity, the credibility of the US
nuclear deterrent might be called into question, undermining the central
deterrence goal of its nuclear forces.]{.underline}

This article focuses on the assurance aspect of US nuclear forces---
helping to assure friends and allies of the American commitment to their
security. There are many ways to assure friends and allies, and not all
rely on threatening potential aggressors with nuclear destruction. These
can include declaratory policy, creating or strengthening mutual defense
agreements and military alliances, fostering broader political
relationships, bolstering reliance on missile defenses, and the forward
deployment of conventional forces.1

None of these means is mutually exclusive, and a sound policy of
assurance will deploy all of them, as appropriate, tailored to specific
circumstances. [Nevertheless, it is the **nuclear deterrence aspect** of
assurance which is being questioned more widely as nuclear force levels
are reduced and which is the focus of this article.]{.underline}

Importantly, the requirements for extended deterrence and assurance may
not be identical. An adversary may be deterred from attacking an ally
even though that ally does not perceive its security to be adequately
"assured." Therefore, [in some cases, the requirements for assurance may
exceed those of deterrence]{.underline}. Clearly, the answer to the
question How much is enough (or too little)? depends on the perception
of both allies and adversaries.2

[In light of growing threats to the United States posed by the
**proliferation of nuclear** and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
capabilities to potential adversaries, the efficacy of security
guarantees also depends on how allies perceive US willingness to defend
their security if doing so risks exposing the US homeland to direct
attack.]{.underline}

#### **Failing to uphold nuclear commitments to the [highest degree]{.underline} causes [nuclear proliferation]{.underline} cascades**

**Trachtenberg 12** (David J. Trachtenberg - American national security
advisor who served as principal deputy under secretary for policy in the
United States Department of Defense, "US Extended Deterrence: How Much
Strategic Force Is Too Little?", Strategic Studies Quarterly Volume 6

<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-06_Issue-2/summer12.pdf>,
MG)

[For a number of states, their own security rests on the viability and
credibility of **US nuclear assurances**. Without the assurance---or
reassurance---that this nuclear umbrella provides, these states may
pursue their **own nuclear weapons acquisition** programs. As one
observer noted, "For allies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and
some NATO states, the stability both of the US deterrent and extended
deterrence guarantees are a significant part of these countries' own
strategic calculus."5 Indeed, there have been numerous studies in recent
years suggesting "the credibility and reliability of US nuclear
assurances are necessary to keep countries . . . from reconsidering
their decisions to be nonnuclear states."6]{.underline}

In a 2007 study that linked US extended deterrence with
nonproliferation, the State Department's International Security Advisory
Board (ISAB) concluded, ["Nuclear umbrella security agreements, whether
unilateral or multilateral, have been, and are expected to continue to
be, effective deterrents to proliferation."7]{.underline} The ISAB
report stated, "There is clear evidence in diplomatic channels that [US
assurances to include the nuclear umbrella have been, and **continue to
be, the single most important reason many allies have foresworn nuclear
weapons**,"]{.underline} and further suggested that ["a lessening of the
US nuclear umbrella could very well trigger a \[**nuclear
proliferation\] cascade in East Asia and the Middle
East**."8]{.underline}

Former secretary of defense Robert Gates acknowledged the importance of
US nuclear weapons to extended deterrence and nonproliferation. In a
2008 speech to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he
declared, "As long as others have nuclear weapons, we must maintain some
level of these weapons ourselves to deter potential adversaries and to
reassure over two dozen allies and partners who rely on our nuclear
umbrella for their security, making it unnecessary for them to develop
their own."9

In 2009, the bipartisan Commission on the Strategic Posture of the
United States concluded, "The US nuclear posture must be designed to
address a very broad set of US objectives, including not just deterrence
of enemies in time of crisis and war but also assurance of our allies
and dissuasion of potential adversaries. Indeed, the assurance function
of the force is as important as ever."10

[By some estimates, nearly 30 countries rely on the extended deterrent
for the ultimate security US nuclear forces provide. Some of these
countries are strong US allies that do not feel sufficiently threatened
by neighbors or adversaries to contemplate developing nuclear weapons of
their own. Others have been dissuaded from doing so as a result of
formal defensive alliances with the United States (such as NATO).
Still]{.underline} others are friends with which the United States does
not have a formal defense relationship but whose security is
nevertheless important to the maintenance of stability and defense of
American interests; therefore, the nuclear umbrella has been extended to
them.

Many of these countries can be found in dangerous or unstable regions
with potentially hostile neighbors. [If the US extended nuclear
deterrent loses credibility, it is most likely to have significant
repercussions among those states who may determine that their security
is best served by **acquiring their own nuclear weapons**
capability.]{.underline}

#### **Nuclear weapons must be the [forefront]{.underline} in order to avoid [existential dangers]{.underline}**

**Trachtenberg 12** (David J. Trachtenberg - American national security
advisor who served as principal deputy under secretary for policy in the
United States Department of Defense, "US Extended Deterrence: How Much
Strategic Force Is Too Little?", Strategic Studies Quarterly Volume 6
Number 2, Summer 2012,

MG)

[The issue of extended deterrence and the role of US nuclear forces in
providing that deterrence to NATO is **not without
controversy**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, it is clear a number of US,
NATO, and non-NATO allies consider the US extended deterrent to be
critical to their security.12 A group including former military chiefs
of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands
reaffirmed the importance of the extended deterrent role of US nuclear
forces and the credibility of nuclear escalatory threats by noting,
"[The first use of nuclear weapons **must remain** in the quiver of
escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of
mass destruction, in order to avoid truly **existential
dangers**."13]{.underline}

[For some, the value of the extended deterrent lies in the deployment of
American nuclear weapons on their territory and the demonstration of
resolve these deployments convey. In these cases, additional US
strategic offensive arms reductions may have less significance on allied
perceptions of American credibility. For others, the value of extended
deterrence lies more in the ability and willingness of the United States
to maintain the effectiveness of its strategic nuclear arsenal.
Therefore, additional strategic arms reductions may **undermine** the
assurance value of American security guarantees.]{.underline}

[In the past, some US allies have expressed strong views regarding the
extended deterrent.]{.underline} These include non-NATO allies. For
example, according to documents recently declassified by Japanese
officials, concern over a possible Sino-US conflict in the mid 1960s led
Prime Minister Sato Eisaku to press Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara
for assurances the United States would be prepared to use its nuclear
weapons against China.

### I/L -- European Soil

#### **They [have]{.underline} to be on European soil in order to be [credible]{.underline}**

**Audenaert 20** (Didier Audenaert - Senior Associate Fellow at the

[Current warfare operating procedures are likely to prioritise the use
of stand-off weapons above gravity bombs. Consideration could therefore
be given for relying entirely on the powerful and modern weapons in the
US' vast nuclear arsenal30 in fulfilling the role of "the supreme
guarantee of the security of the Allies". Of course, the quantity and
the quality of the US' nuclear arsenal is more than sufficient to ensure
deterrence and defence. But,]{.underline} again, there is no consensus
among Allies to change the present nuclear sharing modus operandi and
arrangements. [Overreliance on the US' vast nuclear **territorial**
arsenal would erase the Allies' "broadest participation in nuclear
burden sharing" as well as their interest and involvement in nuclear
consultations: transatlantic collective security would be diluted and
European Allies would **increasingly question American commitment** to
European security; some European Allies could even start looking for
**undesirable remedies**. Furthermore, the European Allies will not
accept a sole and direct dependence on the US' vast nuclear arsenal
without having access to a collective (albeit smaller) **weapon on
European soil** or a political say in the decision-making process which
should be multilateral]{.underline}; one should not forget that the use
of such nuclear weapons would be on the European continent. NATO's
nuclear sharing at least provides European Allies with a decision-making
capability in the worst case. Furthermore, while Europe is not ready or
capable of assuring her own deterrence and defence, there would be a
very high risk of decoupling European and American security as the US
would be far less critically involved in European security: the European
'supreme layer' would be non-existent and [European Allies could be more
easily exposed to coercion. One should recall that, historically, the US
has created the mechanism of nuclear burden sharing with American
nuclear weapons on European soil in order to meet European security
concerns and to **prevent nuclear proliferation** on the European
continent: these objectives have not changed.]{.underline}

[It is clear that the political benefits of nuclear role sharing in the
NATO framework outweigh the military limitations.]{.underline}

[The global nuclear order is entering a phase of high volatility and
increasing nuclear risks. An increased reliance on nuclear
deterrence]{.underline} -- not only by Russia but also by other nuclear
powers -- [may **not lead** to expected proliferation cascades in the
near future as long as US **security guarantees remain credible** to its
allies. However]{.underline}, diminishing disarmament prospects and [a
loss of credibility of negative security assurances risk **polarizing
the NPT** regime further between nuclear weapon states and states that
benefit from their security guarantees on the one hand and non-nuclear
weapon states on the other.]{.underline} Russia's shift from a leading
state within the global nuclear order to one that actively seeks to
undermine its [**norms and principles** will be difficult to manage in a
context in which the NPT is already reeling from ongoing crises and a
lack of consensus.]{.underline}

An absence of arms control dialogue between the United States and Russia
for the foreseeable future also implies [there will likely be **no
successor to the New START** treaty by 2026. This would result in
reduced transparency and predictability]{.underline} in terms of current
strategic arsenals [and no pathway for further reductions or addressing
other issues affecting strategic stability.]{.underline} With less
visibility into decision-making processes or force postures, and little
to no dialogue occurring between Russia and the US or between Russia and
NATO, [transatlantic coordination will **remain key** in order to manage
an increasingly unpredictable security environment through enhanced
deterrence.]{.underline}

#### **[History]{.underline} proves norms [don't]{.underline} resolve proliferation**

**Green 18** (Matthew Green -- Journalism Teacher at Fremont High
School, "How to Stop a Nuclear War: The Non-Proliferation Treaty,

MG)

[Despite the broad legal coverage of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT), a string of failures since the early 1990s have highlighted the
**limitations of existing nonproliferation instruments** to deter
would-be nuclear weapon states. In theory, the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) can refer countries that do not comply with the NPT
to the UN Security Council (UNSC), which in turn can impose sanctions or
other punitive measures. In practice, however, **political
calculations** have often caused deadlock at the UNSC, enabling nuclear
rogues such as Iran and North Korea to defy successive, fairly weak UN
sanctions resolutions with virtual impunity. Multiple UNSC resolutions
condemning these countries' nuclear programs,]{.underline} including
several that imposed sanctions, [have **done little** to stem their
nuclear ambitions.]{.underline} The outcome of the P5+1 negotiations to
stem Iran's nuclear program represents a major test for the
nonproliferation regime's ability to stop proliferation by states.

[Another problem is the lack of adequate **verification and enforcement
mechanisms** available to the IAEA, whose access, budget, personnel
resources and technological resources fall far short of what would be
needed to detect every NPT violation]{.underline}. In 2014, the IAEA's
overall budget was approximately \$345 million, but an advisory panel
determined that the IAEA's budget would need to double by 2020 in order
to meet future demands on its capabilities. Even discounting nuclear
facilities that the IAEA does not have access to, such as those in North
Korea, nuclear materials have reached the black market from facilities
under IAEA safeguards, namely, from several in Pakistan. One positive
step has been the widespread adoption of the IAEA Additional Protocol,
which strengthens the agency's inspections mandate and is in force in
124 countries, including all five recognized nuclear weapon states and,
as of 2014, India. Nonetheless, more than half of all NPT member
states---including Syria and Iran (which has ratified but not
implemented the protocol)---have yet to agree to the additional
safeguards and inspections capabilities allowed under the Additional
Protocol. And despite U.S. efforts, the 2010 NPT Review Conference
failed to achieve consensus to make the Additional Protocol mandatory
for all member states.

[Other multilateral, informal organizations also play a role in
implementing and enforcing the NPT, notably the Nuclear Suppliers Group
(NSG).]{.underline} Made up of forty-six states with advanced nuclear
power programs, the NSG prohibits the transfer of civilian nuclear
materials or technology to states outside the NPT, or those that do not
fully comply with IAEA safeguards. [However, the **NSG's export bans are
not legally binding**, and members (including the United States, Russia,
and China) have pursued civilian nuclear projects with non-NPT
members]{.underline}. In addition, many developing countries have
criticized \[PDF\] the NSG as a club of developed economies that limits
developing countries' access to nuclear materials and technologies.
Finally, the NSG's effectiveness as an export control regime may decline
as nuclear trade increasingly involves \[PDF\] states outside of the
NSG.

[Moreover, what the two skeptical academic camps agree on---that the
dangers associated with nuclear weapons proliferation are
exaggerated---is **rebuttable**. First, they gloss over the serious
military risks faced by nations acquiring nuclear weapons. One can see
this most clearly by their inattention to the numerous historical cases
of **preventive military actions** taken against states attempting to
build their first bomb and to serious plans countries have made to knock
out the nuclear capabilities of new nuclear weapons states.]{.underline}

In the first category are: the British campaign against the
Nazi-operated heavy water plant in Norway; Iran's air strike against
Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1980; Israel's attack of the same reactor in
1981; Iraq's repeated strikes against Bushehr between 1984 and 1988;
America's air strike against Iraq's nuclear facilities and Saddam's
failed Scud missile strike against Israel's Dimona reactor in 1991; an
American Tomahawk missile strike against Iraq's uranium enrichment plant
at Zaafaraniyah; British and American strikes against a variety of
suspect Iraqi nuclear sites in 1998; Israel's air strike against Syria's
covert nuclear reactor in 2007; and U.S. and Israeli covert and cyber
attacks against Iran's nuclear program from 2006 to 2010.

[Just as numerous are the occasions that states planned or prepared to
knock out the nuclear weapons capabilities of their adversaries. The
U.S. military gave serious thought to using **nuclear weapons** to
destroy the Soviet Union's nuclear complex in 1949 and China's in 1964.
It also made preliminary military preparations for attacking North
Korea's nuclear complex in 1994. The Russians, meanwhile, considered
attacking South African nuclear facilities]{.underline} in 1976 after
detecting South African preparations to test. They even asked the United
States for assistance in making the strike. In 1969, a major border
dispute between China and Russia went hot and Moscow seriously
considered attacking China's nuclear complex. [Two years before, Egypt
threatened Israel's production reactor at Dimona. Israel and India,
meanwhile, cooperated in several schemes in the 1980s (one of which
nearly was implemented) to knock out Pakistan's nuclear weapons
facilities at Kahuta.50]{.underline}

Second, while most academic skeptics believe nuclear weapons
automatically deter aggression near perfectly even in small numbers,
others believe nuclear weapons are militarily useless even if these
weapons are numerous and advanced. Because of this, academic skeptics
pay little attention to the security risks that may come with deep
nuclear weapons reductions---i.e., the transitions from nuclear plenty
to zero---risks, which are potentially serious.

[Finally, academic skeptics tend to ignore or gloss over the risks
"**upward" nuclear transitions present**. These dangers are three-fold.
First, as the number of nuclear weapons players increases, the
**gravity, complexity, and likelihood of ruinous nuclear incidents may
increase within states** (e.g., unauthorized or accidental use,
terrorist theft, irredentist seizure, etc.) and between them (e.g.,
**catalytic wars, misread nuclear signaling**, etc.).]{.underline}
Second, and closely related, are the numerous technical and managerial
challenges each nuclear state faces to make their nuclear forces robust
and survivable enough to have any hope of effectively deterring attacks.
These challenges are most severe for new nuclear weapons forces but are
hardly inconsequential for large, mature forces.51 [Last, as the number
of states possessing nuclear forces increases to include nations covered
by nuclear security alliance guarantees, the continued **viability and
coherence of these alliance systems are likely to be tested in the
extreme**, increasing the prospects for war.52]{.underline}

[Third, **the growing risk** of more countries choosing to cross the
nuclear threshold]{.underline}. Ukrainians have now come to regret their
decision to give up the nuclear weapons on their soil---then the world's
third-largest arsenal---in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet
Union. [The pervasive sense of betrayal in Ukraine is prompting a
**defense policy rethink in many non-nuclear weapon states**. Of special
note is the fact that the latest list of nuclear aspirants now includes
America's leading **allies in East Asia, Japan and South Korea**, which
are seriously contemplating the deployment of nuclear weapons on their
soil.\[2\] It reminds the world that the risk of nuclear proliferation
is not confined to Washington's sworn enemies like Iran and North
Korea]{.underline}. In retrospect, during the Cold War the United States
either acquiesced to allies' nuclear ambitions or simply rolled over
when a country it wanted to court crossed the nuclear threshold.

[Does nuclear proliferation affect the risk that nuclear weapons will be
used in a crisis]{.underline}? The question implicates human survival
but is difficult to study, as observations of nuclear war do not
actually exist. [Our empirical knowl- edge is thus limited. I use
experimental games with nuclear options to circumvent the observational
con- straint and construct empirical tests. I find that decisions **are
mostly peaceful at N = 2** despite the existence of nuclear options with
a relative first-strike advantage. This finding is especially relevant
as most nuclear-state con- frontations in history had been bilateral
crises.]{.underline} More gen- erally, I find that one is less likely to
choose the nuclear option when it is known that the number of nuclear
actors in the crisis is small, and more likely to choose the nuclear
option when it is known that the number of nuclear actors is large. [In
particular, a jump in the number of nuclear actors in crisis **beyond N
= 2** significantly **increases** the chance of choosing the **nuclear
option**.]{.underline} Preliminary probes also suggest that players in
inter-alliance crises are more peaceful when they have second-strike
counter- value capabilities, and that nuclear framing has no sig-
nificant effect on the use of the nuclear option

[Dealing with the second problem with reactor-grade
plutonium]{.underline}, the heat generated by Pu-238 and Pu-240,
requires careful management of the heat in the device. [There are well
developed means for addressing these problems and they are **not
considered a significant hurdle** to the production of nuclear weapons,
even for **developing states or sub-national groups**. The]{.underline}
radiation from Americium-241 means that more shielding and greater
precautions to protect personnel might be necessary when building and
handling nuclear explosives made from reactor-grade plutonium. [But
these difficulties are **not prohibitive**. While reactor-grade
plutonium has a slightly larger critical mass than weapon-grade
plutonium (meaning that somewhat more material would be needed for a
bomb), this would not be a major impediment for design of either crude
or sophisticated nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[The degree to which these obstacles can be overcome depends on the
sophistication of the state or group attempting to produce a nuclear
weapon. At the lowest level of sophistication, a potential proliferating
state or subnational group using designs and technologies no more
sophisticated than those used in first-generation nuclear weapons
**could build a nuclear weapon** from reactorgrade plutonium that would
have an assured, reliable yield of one or a few kilotons (and a probable
yield significantly higher than that). At the other end of the spectrum,
advanced nuclear weapon states such as the United States and Russia,
using modern designs, could produce weapons from reactor-grade plutonium
having reliable explosive yields, weight, and other characteristics
generally comparable to those of weapons made from weapon-grade
plutonium]{.underline}. The greater radioactivity would mean increased
radiation doses to workers fabricating such weapons, and military
personnel spending long periods of time in close proximity to them, and
the greater heat and radiation generated from reactor-grade plutonium
might result in a need to replace certain weapon components more
frequently. [Proliferating states using designs of intermediate
sophistication could produce weapons with assured yields **substantially
higher** than the kilotonrange possible with a simple, first-generation
nuclear device. \*]{.underline}

[Every state which has built nuclear weapons from plutonium to date has
chosen to produce weapons-grade plutonium for that purpose. States have
been willing to make large investments in some cases to acquire
weapon-grade rather than reactor-grade plutonium]{.underline}: the
United States, for example, in the 1980s, considered spending billions
of dollars on the Special Isotope Separation facility to enrich
reactor-grade plutonium to weapon-grade. [The disadvantage of
reactor-grade plutonium is **not so much in the effectiveness of the
nuclear weapons** that can be made from it as in the **increased
complexity** in designing, fabricating, and handling them. The
possibility that either a state or a sub-national group would choose to
use reactor-grade plutonium, should sufficient stocks of weapon-grade
plutonium not be readily available, **cannot be
discounted.**]{.underline}

[In short, reactor-grade plutonium is weapons-usable, whether by
**unsophisticated proliferators or by advanced nuclear weapon
states**]{.underline}. Theft of separated plutonium, whether
weapon-grade or reactor-grade, would pose a grave security risk."

[There is a school of thought that]{.underline} any concentration of
Pu-240 or Pu-242 in a fuel of over 1-2% [renders the fuel unsuitable for
weapons manufacture]{.underline}. Since the enriched uranium reactor
produces such a waste, and since isotopes of plutonium cannot be
separated chemically, this is equivalent to saying that only the
plutonium produced by a natural uranium reactor is of weapons quality.
[This view is **subject to question**. It is conceded that a great power
interested in only very high quality and control standards in weapons
would avoid such fuel. This would **not necessarily follow for a nuclear
aspirant**]{.underline}. If high Pu-240 content, say up to 8-10%,
plutonium were the only available material, [a country might accept the
unreliability and fabrication complexities associated with such fuels
**in preference to having no weapons at all.** While there is no
evidence that this has ever been done, it should not be ruled out as a
possibility.]{.underline}

Recapitulation

[Virtually **any nation** can come up with a delivery system for a
nuclear weapon.]{.underline} The construction of the device is
considerably more difficult but, with the possible exception of an
implosion mechanism suitable for high Pu-240 plutonium fuels, [a long
list of countries could manage a low yield solution if they were to
decide to give priority to the task and if they will accept fairly low
standards]{.underline}. It may be sometime before technology will permit
refinement of weapons grade U-235 fuels for all but the very rich
industrial nations. In the interim, however, [enough plutonium can be
processed by chemical methods from reactor waste to permit **any country
with even a very modest reactor program** to charge a few bombs a year.
The short answer to the question \"**Can they build the bomb**?\" would
appear, except for very undeveloped fourth world countries, to be
**yes**.]{.underline}

### ! -- Prolif O/W Climate

#### **Tests prove nuclear proliferation [outweighs]{.underline} and [turns]{.underline} climate change**

**Toon et al. 21** (Owen B. Toon PhD - Professor in the Department of

University , Richard P. Turco - American atmospheric scientist, and

May 2021,
<https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/modelling-armageddon-the-effects-of-nuclear-weapons-on-climate/109988/>,
MG)

Obviously, all of these factors could never be determined precisely
beforehand. [Even so, enough **work has been done** -- exhaustively in
many areas -- to define the boundaries of the problem. For example, the
damages inflicted by a nuclear blast and prompt radiation are relatively
well understood from more than 500 above-ground weapons tests conducted
from the 1940s through the 1960s]{.underline}. Also known are the
incendiary effects of nuclear bursts, but these are less well known
partly because testing was not as focused on this aspect of nuclear
weapons. [Understanding the climate changes that might result from smoke
produced by nuclear fires requires knowledge of the types and amounts of
fuel consumed, the quantities and forms of black carbon (the highly
absorbing component of smoke) generated, and the fraction of that black
carbon deposited in the upper atmosphere, where it could reside for
years.]{.underline}

As each of these questions is slowly being resolved, the overall
uncertainty in the outcome of nuclear war is steadily being reduced. New
evidence, for example, from large forest fires in Canada (2017) and
Australia (2020) reveals that [**smoke** from intense fires **is readily
lofted** into the stratosphere. There, without rain to remove it, smoke
can be tracked by satellites over many months, and its distribution
analysed using the same models employed to predict global changes
following a nuclear war, including nuclear winter.]{.underline} The
behaviour of the wildfire smoke mimics that predicted for massive smoke
injections expected from nuclear-ignited firestorms, [including
alterations in wind patterns and air temperatures^3^]{.underline}.
Moreover, newer simulations of historical volcanic eruptions also
indicate similar effects -- such as the "year without a summer" that
followed the Tambora eruption of 1815 -- and which was noted by Ronald
Reagan as a reason to fear a nuclear winter.

Recently, we employed these same models to simulate the possible outcome
of a regional-scale nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, perhaps
triggered by their continuing disputes over Kashmir. [Remarkably, even
such a **limited use of nuclear weapons** could lead to the **coldest
global temperatures** **recorded in the last 1,000 years^4^**, resulting
in a reduction in worldwide crop yields by tens of
percent^5^.]{.underline}

It is generally agreed that the only legitimate reason for maintaining
substantial arsenals of nuclear weapons is to avoid war. [Nevertheless,
the existence of such weapons and the robust means to use them, implies
that **global nuclear conflict cannot be dismissed as impossible or even
improbable**. And **unlike global warming**, which has been decades and
centuries in the making, nuclear warfare could play out in **mere hours
or days**. But the consequences would last years, shatter civilization,
and create climatic anomalies comparable to a sudden ice age, leading to
deprivation on a global scale^6^]{.underline}, possibly affecting
billions of individuals. [Leadership must do everything in its power
to]{.underline} ensure that nuclear weapons can never be used, including
actionable treaties on arms reductions, national policies to increase
weapon security, and international diplomacy to **[stop and reverse
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**.

### T/C -- NATO

####  **The US [clarifying]{.underline} their retaliation posture [encourages]{.underline} warfare, alienates [allies]{.underline}, and destroys [NATO unity]{.underline} -- turns case**

**Robertson 21** (George Robertson - a former UK defence secretary and
was the 10th secretary-general of Nato, "US nuclear arms shift could
raise risk of inadvertent conflict", Financial Times, 14 November 2021,
<https://www.ft.com/content/1e0f2194-dbc2-4c37-84a2-75308daa1710>, MG)\
Biden has already hinted that he is considering a "sole purpose" policy,
[a pledge that the US would use nuclear weapons only in a narrowly
prescribed set of circumstances. "I believe that the sole purpose of the
US nuclear arsenal should be deterring --- and, if necessary,
retaliating against --- a nuclear attack]{.underline}," he wrote in
March 2020. "As president, I will work to put that belief into
practice." A number of other influential voices are now encouraging a
move in this direction, or even a shift to a policy of "no first use" of
nuclear weapons. [For the sake of **Nato unity**, these ideas must be
resisted.]{.underline}

"No first use" sounds appealing, and its advocates argue that the US can
set an example to other nuclear powers that would, in time, reduce the
threat of nuclear conflict. They are wrong. There are three reasons why
both [this and "sole purpose" would undermine deterrence, **divide
Nato** and increase the risk of conflict.]{.underline}

[First, a US declaration would be treated with scepticism by potential
adversaries --- because authoritarian regimes are likely to judge others
by their own standards --- and could even encourage them **towards
military aggression** if the threat of nuclear reprisals is lifted.
Paradoxically, changing the present definition of nuclear deterrence
would increase the risk of a **major conventional conflict** that could
return us to the era of mass civilian casualties last seen in the 20th
century.\
Second, Nato as a nuclear alliance is **deliberately ambiguous** about
the circumstances in which it might authorise the deployment of nuclear
weapons to deter attacks on the territory or interests of its
members.]{.underline} In the aftermath of the cold war, when there was
no credible conventional threat to Nato's European allies, the alliance
reduced its emphasis on nuclear deterrence. But Russia's invasions of
Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, and the massive boost to Moscow's
conventional and nuclear capabilities in the past few years, have
necessarily raised the profile of nuclear weapons in Nato's defence
posture.

[While nuclear ambiguity may be uncomfortable, it is **necessary** in
order to reduce the temptation for adversaries to "game" our deterrence
strategy by taking actions that will fall just short of provoking a
military response.]{.underline}

[Third, at a time of heightened tension due to Russia and China's
growing military power and threatening behaviour, a US declaration of
"sole purpose" or "no first use" would **unsettle Washington's allies**
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. By casting doubt on its security
guarantees, the US would run the risk of making its allies and friends
**more susceptible to coercion**, or of driving them to develop nuclear
weapons of their own as a form of insurance. And that would potentially
kickstart further nuclear proliferation and add to the risk of
pre-emptive actions by Russia and China.]{.underline}

Advocates of change are right to say that progress on nuclear
disarmament is painfully slow. But it will be achieved only by skilful
diplomatic management of the conflicting ambitions and interests of the
major powers. Painstaking efforts are needed to revive bilateral and, in
time, multilateral steps towards verifiable nuclear disarmament and the
prevention of proliferation[. Eye-catching gestures from the US such as
declarations of "sole purpose" or 'no first use' would **undermine the
Nato alliance** and lead only to greater instability and
insecurity.]{.underline}

### AO -- Turkish Arms Race

#### **Concerns over [nuclear]{.underline} credibility push [Turkey]{.underline} to pursue [nukes]{.underline}**

and disarmament program at the International Institute for Strategic
Studies and former US diplomat serving inter alia as Deputy Assistant

[In Turkey's case, the US nuclear weapons stationed at Incirlik Air
Force base are seen as playing an important security role, providing
reassurance of American assistance in the event of an emergency and a
"hook" tethering Turkey to the European mainland. The nuclear weapons
also appear to perform a **nonproliferation function**: As long as
Turkey has access to US nuclear weapons it can turn to in extremis,
there is **no need** for Ankara to consider developing its **own nuclear
weapons** option.]{.underline} Given that the whole of Turkey falls
within range of Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, [the nuclear
weapons may be **more relevant now** than they were in the past two
decades]{.underline}. Turkish officials say they do not feel directly
threatened by Iran, but they do feel a strong need to maintain power
parity with the other non-Arab Muslim regional power. If Iran acquires
nuclear weapons, Turkey's relative power in the region will weaken and
its sense of security will diminish if the US arsenal is withdrawn
precipitously. [If US nuclear weapons were to be withdrawn from **other
NATO countries**, Turkey would have reason to feel exposed and to
question the fundamental principles of alliance solidarity and
burdensharing that have been the basis of Turkey's nuclear hosting
arrangements]{.underline} (Kibaroglu, 2010).

For Ankara, the deterrent role of the US nuclear weapons in Turkey has
shifted focus from the Soviet Union to Turkey's regional neighbors Iraq,
Syria, and Iran-all of which have at some point acquired unconventional
weapons systems and ballistic missiles (Kibaroglu, 2010). Given Turkey's
recent and ongoing rapprochement with these countries, however, the
deterrence rationale for the nuclear stationing has eroded. [Efforts to
bring about a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East may also
undermine the **viability of the deployments**. In addition, many Turks
have a lingering skepticism about NATO security guarantees, which they
did not feel were forthcoming in the first and second Gulf
Wars.]{.underline}

Russia has every reason to provide the know-how for the construction of
Turkey's Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in an attempt to hinder NATO's

Russian-Turkish [opportunistic](https://slpress.gr/diethni/i-rosotoyrkiki-proseggisi-echei-kai-atheati-opsi-i-antifasi-tis-dysis/) cooperation
will not feed the latter's ambition in attaining nuclear weapons. Their
competing
interests [collide](https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2021RP05/) in
many cases. Russia wouldn't want to see a nuclear arsenal in such close
proximity to its borders. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of
Russia Vladimir Zhirinovsky
is [convinced](https://www.easternherald.com/2021/01/19/erdogans-appearance-of-nuclear-weapons-be-a-threat-to-russia/):
if Iran and especially Turkey have nuclear weapons, they will turn
against Russia. This does not suggest that Turkey will not achieve its
aim[. On the contrary it means that Turkey will have to overcome many
obstacles set by important states with interests in the wider region,
such
as [Israel](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/turkey-is-increasingly-becoming-a-threat-to-israel-635054), [France](https://www.iris-france.org/140221-a-look-upon-turkeys-future-nuclear-weapons-policy/), [Egypt](https://ahvalnews.com/nuclear-bomb/iran-nuclear-bomb-paves-way-saudi-turkey-follow-suit-says-biden), [Saudi

Above all, Turkey will have to face the growing **conflict of interest
with the US.** There are many reasons upon which Turkey will not be
tolerated as nuclear-weapon state. As abovementioned, this will
**instigate its geostrategic autonomy**, causing the
**existing Euro-Atlantic security architecture to disintegrate**. In
addition, it will trigger a **nuclear arms race** in the wider
region.]{.underline} All of these destabilization fears have long

Drifting apart from the West

[Nonetheless, Turkey's eagerness to embark on a nuclear-weapons program
should be seen in the bigger context.]{.underline} There are clear
indications that the Eurasianist ideology creeps in Turkey's top-ranking
policymakers. Analysts identify this ideology as a Turkish version of
the [Ba'athism](https://www.mei.edu/publications/rise-eurasianism-turkish-foreign-policy-can-turkey-change-its-pro-western-orientation) in
the Arab world. The Eurasianists argue that Turkey's interests lie
outside the Western world and therefore should join the
"anti-imperialist" camp led by Russia and China.

When speaking about Afghanistan, Turkish president Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan  [said](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/president-erdogan-reiterates-2-state-solution-to-cyprus-issue-166445):
"Imperial powers entered Afghanistan; they have been there for over 20
years. We also stood by our Afghan brothers against all imperial
powers." A
similar [statement](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/south-asia/taliban-pakistan-imran-khan-afghanistan-b1903821.html) made
by the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, revealed the common grounds
of the two Sunni forces in their ideological (and religious) beliefs. He
said that the Taliban are "breaking the chains of slavery." Some would
argue that both statesmen are influenced by the jihad theorist Sayyid
Qutb (author of the influential book "Milestones") and his idea of
victimization of Muslims by foreigners or "imperialists". He believed
that western nations are attempting to undermine Islamic empowerment
thus jihad is the tool to liberate the "suppressed" Muslims from the
"imperial powers" (see

 Conclusions

[It is evident that the alleged new venture of Turkey in the nuclear
weapons field is in all cases a cause of serious concern for its Western
allies. Its decision to drift away
([1](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2021/01/19/494738/flashpoints-u-s-turkey-relations-2021/) and [2](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/17721/erdogan-afghanistan-terrorists))
from the **North Atlantic alliance** and become a strategically
autonomous Eurasianist power, presupposes the acquisition of a nuclear
arsenal. This will lead to a **reflexive nuclear arms race** of key
states in the wider sensitive region, hindering the already fragile
balances and **undermining the existing Euro-Atlantic security
architecture**.]{.underline} Such prospect cannot be reversed by false
hopes on a softer policy after a leadership change in the Turkish
elections of 2023, or worst by transactionalism that will boost Turkey's
confidence. It is arguable that Turkey's overambitious geopolitical
balancing act is pushing the limits of its diplomatic, economic and
military capabilities. Therefore restraining its activities in these
fields (especially its military hardware / technology as well as the
space, missile and nuclear programs) by the states affected most and the
US, is most likely to weaken its eagerness and tame its revisionist
goals.

[The bad news is that low probability is not the same as no probability,
and all of the possible Saudi responses entail significant risks and
costs.]{.underline} In the near term, it is technically impossible for
Saudi Arabia to indigenously develop nuclear weapons; the risk of
Pakistan transferring nuclear weapons to the Kingdom is also overstated.
Nevertheless, [the risk of the latter scenario is **not
zero**.]{.underline} Moreover, even if Riyadh fails to acquire its own
nuclear weapons shortly after Iran does, a Saudi hedging strategy could
still produce such a capability over the long run. Either the
low-probability Pakistani option or the higher-probability hedging path
could lead to [the emergence of a **poly-nuclear Middle East**, with
profound consequences for the region.]{.underline} The basic principles
of nuclear deterrence that held during the Cold War, and that continue
to hold in South and East Asia today, would likely hold if there were
multiple nuclear powers in the Middle East. [However, tensions and
crises would probably increase. And even if all the relevant actors were
assumed to be rational, various factors -- the absence of secure
second-strike capabilities (at least for some period of time),
**unreliable early warning** and command-and-control systems, close
geographic proximity and deep mutual distrust -- could still
inadvertently produce a **regional nuclear war** via
**miscalculations**, accidents or unauthorized use.183]{.underline}

It is also good news that the Saudis are less likely to be attracted to
a Pakistani extended deterrence guarantee (and Islamabad is less likely
to offer one) than is commonly assumed. [But should this
moderate-probability scenario emerge, it would extend the South Asian
geopolitical competition directly into the Middle East, thereby
connecting two of the world's most crisis- and conflict-prone regions
into a **nuclear daisy chain**.]{.underline}

### Link Turn

#### **No link or we turn -- policy makers think nuclear deterrence is [eternal]{.underline} and AND think emerging tech makes nuclear deterrence [better]{.underline}**

[We have studied the views that experts and decision-makers have when it
comes to the impact of emerging technologies on nuclear deterrence and
disarmament]{.underline}. Beyond the substantial findings, discussed
below, our article also demonstrates that expert surveys might be a
suitable measure to map the views of epistemic community when faced with
future, unpredictable developments. Regardless of a particular approach
one uses, using multiple expert insights is a promising way to deal with
uncertainty about the future. This is not related only to the field of
security policy or international relations. As DeWees and Minson (2018)
note, "the combination of multiple, independent judgments is often more
accurate than even an expert's individual judgment." While there are
possible risks (as DeWees andMinson make clear, once experts make up
their mind, it is difficult to persuade them otherwise), faced with
uncertainty the wisdom of the crowd offers an attractive option.

[Our respondents noted that the destabilizing impacts of emerging
technologies in the nuclear realm come from the fact that these
technologies compound the risks of close calls, mishaps and
misunderstandings. They were concerned about the potentials for future
close calls and misinterpretation and therefore thought that as emerging
technologies become more ubiquitous, they also make **nuclear deterrence
more unstable**.]{.underline}

Some of the decision-makers felt that some of the threats commonly
associated with emerging technologies in the scholarly discourse are
overblown. [There was, for example, skepticism about whether nuclear
launch decisions will ever be delegated to an entity other than humans,
or whether HGVs are anything other than fancy missiles. Our interviewees
were concerned about cyber risks, but they also felt that the use of
cyber technologies for strategic purposes is most likely not going to
happen. These findings underline that in spite of the growing attention
given to emerging technologies among thinktankers and academics alike,
**decision-makers are less concerned** about these
technologies.]{.underline} This means that either the experts are
alarmist, or that they need to build better epistemic communities to
convey to decisionmakers the risks that these technologies pose.
[Furthermore, the centrality attached to nuclear weapons in strategic
thinking and planning appears to undermine any idea of weakening. Our
survey and interviews showed that while the respondents could imagine
that emerging technologies will have a more prominent role in deterrence
by denial; **nuclear weapons will remain dominant in deterrence by
punishment**.]{.underline} This is rather curious since recent work in
thinking about long-range conventional strikes highlights that these
technologies might change the calculus and appear to affect deterrence
by punishment (Montgomery, 2020). [However, when it comes to
technologies like HGVs or cyberwarfare, the scholars are much more
skeptical.]{.underline}

[When referring to the positive applications of emerging technologies,
many of those surveyed reported that technologies can be used to
**enhance nuclear safeguarding** and verification measures. In this
respect, decisionmakers felt **that if there is one contribution that
emerging technologies can make** to nuclear disarmament, it would be
here]{.underline}. Curiously, our experts were quite skeptical about the
prospects for global nuclear disarmament. The majority of the experts
did not think that nuclear disarmament was going to happen in the next
50 years, and a large portion of the experts did not think that nuclear
disarmament would make us safer. This seems to support the realist view
that nuclear proliferation is a result of the security dilemma, and the
removal of nuclear weapons would not resolve the underlying calculus but
might make conflict more likely (Waltz, 1981). This is doubly curious,
since the majority of our experts came from European countries, where
civil society pressure for nuclear disarmament is growing. Therefore, we
observe that both the general public and civil society are out of step
with the experts. The perception that nuclear disarmament is
unachievable (in a reasonable timeframe) and that it would not make the
world safer might explain why nuclear disarmament is not a policy
priority for numerous experts. [As Pelopidas (2020) recently remarked,
if elites believe that **nuclear weapons are eternal**, then the
motivation for doing something about disarmament is not as much of a
priority for them.]{.underline}

### I/L Turn

#### **Relying on nuclear [doesn't]{.underline} reassure allies but encourages [nuke prolif]{.underline} -- enhanced conventional deterrence solves**

[Maintaining allies' confidence in US commitments requires frequent
consultations, political reassurances, high-level meetings, and
cooperation in military planning. US **conventional forces** also
provide a global, visible, flexible, and credible means of reassuring
allies --- particularly when they are deployed on the ally's territory
or conduct temporary deployments to exercise jointly with allied forces.
Though nuclear guarantees are an important component of US security
commitments, allies doubt them more than they doubt US conventional
commitments because of the greater risk they pose to the US
homeland.]{.underline} If an adversary in fact attacked a US ally with
conventional forces, the adversary would have already discounted the US
commitment to defend the ally. And if US credibility had already been
discounted, the potentially graver consequences of a nuclear response
would make nuclear guarantees even less credible in the eyes of the
adversary. [Consequently, the US should make clear repeatedly that it
will fulfill all of its treaty obligations and would respond
**conventionally to conventional** attacks against allies, and with
nuclear weapons in the event of nuclear attacks.]{.underline} The long
history of US security commitments, and the sacrifices in blood and
money which the American people have repeatedly made in defense of these
commitments, provide ample evidence that US security guarantees are
credible.

Although the US should pursue all feasible conventional and diplomatic
means to assure allies, [there is **no level** of force deployment,
whether conventional or nuclear, that can guarantee allies' confidence
in American security commitments. Some allies have expressed concerns
about American security commitments despite the presence of
tens-of-thousands of permanently based US forces, underscoring the
dependence of allied confidence on factors beyond military presence.
Joint command and control of tactical nuclear weapons under NATO nuclear
sharing arrangements has apparently **failed to reassure** some NATO
members, which demonstrates that the forward deployment of nuclear
weapons may also be **insufficient** to assure allies]{.underline}.
Furthermore, though it is undiplomatic to acknowledge, allies often
express grave concerns about potential threats and worry about US
security commitments, but then fail to take steps to significantly
increase their own defense capabilities, raising questions about the
seriousness of their concerns. And the frank truth is that the
[alternatives to dependence on US security guarantees are even less
palatable for most US allies. Allying with Russia or China is not a
reasonable alternative to a US alliance,]{.underline} attempting to
balance Russian or Chinese military capabilities unilaterally or in
combination with neighboring states would be a difficult and unnecessary
choice, [and developing nuclear weapons of their own is in most cases
**too far** a stretch financially or politically.]{.underline}

[By making clear that the US believes nuclear weapons can serve only to
deter nuclear attacks, the US also would be helping to weaken
perceptions of the importance of these weapons and to strengthen
perceptions of the dangers they pose, thereby facilitating efforts to
limit or reverse pro- liferation and reduce nuclear arsenals. In
contrast, if the United States were to make clear it relies on nuclear
weapons for a larger set of roles, it would **legitimize these
weapons**, falsely draw attention to their potential uses, and thereby
**encourage nuclear proliferation**. US threats to respond to
conventional attack with nuclear weapons exaggerate the utility of
nuclear weapons and could reinforce other states' inclination to acquire
nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. If the US were to threaten a nuclear
attack despite its conventional superiority, states with weaker
conventional forces might have even more incentive to follow suit. The
repetition of explicit threats to initiate the first use of nuclear
weapons in a conflict could render such threats more credible and
gradually weaken the taboo against the use of nuclear weapons.

In all of these potential use of military force scenarios, save nuclear
deterrence, [nuclear weapons do not provide any capabilities or
attributes US conventional superiority does not also provide. In short,
nuclear weapons **do not advance US interests**, diplomacy, or nuclear
policy, and its nuclear posture should therefore minimize
them.]{.underline}

### No I/L

#### **Nuclear is [dead]{.underline} -- everyone [moved on]{.underline}**

Chalmers and **Lunn 10** (Malcolm Chalmers - Professorial Fellow in
British Security Policy at the Royal United Services Institute for
Defence and Security Studies, Simon Lunn - Associate Fellow of the Royal
United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, "NATO's
Tactical Nuclear Dilemma", RUSI, March 2010,
<https://static.rusi.org/201003_op_natos_tactical_nuclear_dilemma.pdf>,
MG)

[Since the Cold War ended, however, the role of these weapons in NATO
strategy has been dramatically reduced, as have their
numbers.]{.underline} Unofficial estimates suggest that only around
150-250 US warheads remain in Europe, all free-fall gravity bombs
designed for use with US and allied tactical aircraft. This reduction
has largely taken place away from the public spotlight, with little
interest beyond the specialist defence and arms control communities.

Yet the prospect that this protracted drawdown might soon lead to their
final elimination has now triggered a major debate on the role of
nuclear weapons in NATO strategy. This is between those who believe that
elimination could be a relatively cost-free approach to taking forward
the disarmament agenda set out in President Obama's April 2009 Prague
speech; and those who fear it could do serious damage to the credibility
of US extended nuclear deterrence. As a result, reducing from 200
weapons to zero looks set to be much more controversial than the 90 per
cent reduction (from 2,500 to 200) that has taken place since 1991. What
these weapons lack in operational utility (given their short range and
location, together with the continuing availability of larger and more
powerful strategic arsenals) is now greatly outweighed by their symbolic
significance.

[On the one hand, key NATO governments, including those of the US, the
UK and Germany, now accept the argument that a credible
non-proliferation policy also requires a strengthened commitment to
nuclear disarmament. Moreover, some influential voices (within and
outside government) increasingly argue that the continuing deployment of
US **nuclear weapons** in Europe, alongside the dual-capable aircraft
(DCA) of European NATO members, **is an obstacle** to fulfilling this
commitment. The case for withdrawing these weapons has been bolstered by
reports that safety standards have been compromised at the nuclear
storage facilities, as well as by concerns at the budgetary cost to the
US of providing protection of a sufficiently high standard. Moreover,
even **supporters of continuing deployment** recognise that these forces
are of little operational relevance.]{.underline} A combination of
diplomatic, budgetary and operational reasons, therefore, is pointing to
the need for a reformulated approach.

[Extended deterrence as a brake against further nuclear proliferation
Some experts claim that thanks to US nuclear weapons stationed in Europe
some host nations have agreed not to develop their own nuclear
weapons.53]{.underline} The states most cited are Turkey and, to a
lesser extent, Germany. [This argument, however, **is flawed**. In NATO
there is **no proof** that it was extended deterrence that prevented
nuclear proliferation.]{.underline} [Germany is legally bound not to
develop nuclear weapons because of its constitution, and German public
opinion has always been very much anti-nuclear. According to Harald
Müller, observers regularly underestimate how deeply rooted Germany's
non-nuclear status is in its political culture:]{.underline}

Any German government that sought to effect a change in the country's
nuclear status would risk public protest ranging all the way up to
civil-war-style conditions compared to which the events surrounding the
shifting of Castor \[civilian nuclear spent fuel\] containers would
probably appear trivial.54

The 2011 German decision to close all German nuclear reactors is another
indication of the German anti-nuclear political culture.

[Likewise, it is also doubtful whether Turkey would have developed its
own nuclear weapons if the United States had not stationed them in the
country]{.underline}. There is increasing pressure today to create a
Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the Middle East, as formally declared during
the NPT Review Conference in May 2010. This is pushing Turkey to rethink
its current policy vis-à-vis US nuclear weapons based on its territory.
[More and more Turkish experts are in favor of withdrawal.55 In the
unlikely case that the Turkish government believed that possessing
nuclear weapons was of vital interest for the nation, it is **doubtful**
whether the presence of the remaining number of US nuclear weapons would
really makes any difference in its calculation]{.underline}.

[HOW ABOUT PROLIFERATION]{.underline} AND TERRORISM?

[Great powers are one thing, some might say, but rogue
states]{.underline} or terrorist groups [are another. If they go
nuclear, it's game over --- which is why any further proliferation must
be prevented by all possible measures, up to and including
war.]{.underline}

[That logic might seem plausible at first, but it **breaks down on close
examination**. Not only has the world already survived the acquisition
of nuclear weapons by some of the]{.underline} \[~~craziest~~\] [mass
murderers in history (Stalin and Mao), but proliferation has **slowed
down** rather than sped up over time. Dozens of technologically
sophisticated countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but
very few have done so. This is because nuclear weapons turn out to be
**difficult and expensive** to acquire and strategically **provocative
to possess**.]{.underline}

[They have not even proved to enhance status much, as many expected they
would.]{.underline} Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today
than they would without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased
if it became nuclear? Did China's status improve when it went nuclear
--- or when its economy grew? And would anybody really care (or even
notice) if the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or
halved?

[Alarmists have misjudged not only the pace of proliferation but also
its effects. Proliferation is incredibly dangerous and necessary to
prevent, we are told, because going nuclear would supposedly empower
rogue states and lead them to dominate their region. The details of how
this domination would happen are rarely discussed,]{.underline} but the
general idea seems to be that once a country has nuclear weapons, it can
use them to threaten others and get its way, with nonnuclear countries
deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out of fear.

[Except, of course, that in three‐​quarters of a century, the United
States has **never been able to get anything close to that obedience**
from anybody, even when it had a nuclear monopoly.]{.underline} So why
should it be true for, say, Iran or North Korea? [It is far more likely
that a nuclear rogue's threats would cause its rivals to **join together
against the provocateur** ---]{.underline} just as countries around the
Persian Gulf responded to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait by closing ranks
to oppose, rather than acquiescing in, his effort at domination.

#### **Statistical modelling [proves]{.underline} no nuke prolif impact**

**Cohen 16** (Michael D. Cohen PhD - convenor of the National Security
College's PhD program and Senior Lecturer at the Crawford School of
Public Policy, "How nuclear proliferation causes conflict: the case for

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10736700.2016.1256541>, MG)

[University of Pennsylvania's Michael Horowitz conducted a statistical
analysis and found that the probability of new nuclear states
reciprocating disputes quickly increases and then **decreases over
time.**]{.underline}

The probability that a nuclear state will reciprocate a dispute with a
non-nuclear state drops from .53 one year after developing nuclear
weapons to .23 in year 56. Two new nuclear powers are 67 percent more
likely to reciprocate a dispute than two average non-nuclear states. Two
experienced nuclear powers are 65 percent less likely to reciprocate
than two average non-nuclear states. The probability of dispute
reciprocation between an experienced and new nuclear power is 26 percent
greater than two non-nuclear states, and the probability of a very
experienced state and a somewhat experienced state reciprocating is 42
percent less than two non-nuclear states.86

[University of California-San Diego's Erik Gartzke conducted a similar
statistical test when the dependent variable was dispute initiation
rather than reciprocation and found similarly robust results.87 Gartzke
found that, while the overall effect of nuclear proliferation on
conflict propensity is neutral, there is variation in the effect of
proliferation over time. Nuclear proliferation influences the **timing,
rather than the occurrence**, of disputes. While new nuclear states are
prone to initiate militarized disputes, over time they moderate their
policies and become as **likely to initiate disputes as they were before
nuclear proliferation**.88]{.underline} These effects wash out in
statistical tests that do not control for experience with nuclear
weapons. In short, if Iran and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and
challenge their regional status quo, the historical record suggests that
they will not do so for long. Thus James M. Lindsay and Ray Takeyh of
the Council on Foreign Relations recently claimed that a nuclear Iran
would be most dangerous "at first, when it would likely be at its most
reckless." B[ut, "like other nuclear aspirants before them, the
guardians of the theocracy might discover that nuclear bombs are
**simply not good** for diplomatic leverage or strategic
aggrandizement." 89]{.underline}

Conclusion: proliferation pessimism, Iran, and North Korea

[Three of the four mechanisms long alleged to make nuclear proliferation
cause interstate conflict find **little to no empirical support** when
the endogeneity, omitted-variable bias, and conceptual-confusion issues
addressed above are recognized and applied to the evidence.
Preventive-war motivations, nonsurvivable arsenals, and organizational
logics that lead to accidents do not cause armed conflict. The only
mechanism that has systematically led to conflict is conventional
aggression by weak revisionists after nuclear proliferation, but a few
years of experience with nuclear weapons moderates the conflict
propensity of new nuclear states. By failing to specify how frequently
we should observe preventive motivations, their effect on nonsurvivable
arsenals, or how organizational logics lead to conflict, accidents, and
nuclear war, **proliferation pessimist claims are
unfalsifiable**.]{.underline} Pessimist scholars need to specify how
much longer we should observe them not leading to conflict before
concluding that their threat has been greatly exaggerated.

[The undesirability of nuclear use has prevented scholars from coming to
terms with what a more careful and systematic reading of the historical
record suggests about the relationship between these mechanisms and
conflict. Sagan]{.underline} has argued that proliferation fatalism and
deterrence optimism reduce incentives to combat proliferation.90 [But
these same dynamics have led scholars to **vastly exaggerate** the
number of threats posed by the spread of nuclear weapons. If the
greatest danger posed by nuclear proliferation is conventional
aggression in the short-term, scholars need to rediscover how
**deterrence** can moderate the high conflict propensity of new nuclear
states.91]{.underline} Arguments about the frequency of nuclear
escalation, however, say nothing about its cost. Isn't the possibility
of nuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula, for example, evidence
against the arguments made throughout this paper? A few cases of
accidental, unintentional, or deliberate nuclear escalation could show
that the mechanisms offered by pessimist scholars linking nuclear
proliferation and conflict survive the criticisms leveled at them here.
A lower bar for the proliferation-pessimist theory to pass might be one
case of nuclear escalation. [But after seventy years, nuclear weapons
have **not once** led to conflict through the mechanisms addressed
here.]{.underline}

#### **Studies prove nuclear prolif has either [no effect]{.underline} on the risk of interstate conflict or [reverses]{.underline} it**

**Suzuki 15** (Akisato Suzuki - Adjunct Research Fellow at the School of
Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, "Is
more better or worse? New empirics on nuclear proliferation and
interstate conflict by Random Forests", Research and Politics, 2015,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015589625>, MG)

[The main findings reveal that the optimist expectation of the
relationship between nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict is
empirically supported:9 first, a larger number of nuclear states on
average **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate conflict;
and second, there is **no clear evidence** that the emergence of new
nuclear states increases the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict]{.underline}. Gartzke and Jo (2009) argue that [nuclear weapons
themselves have no exogenous effect on the probability of conflict,
because when a state is engaged in or expects to engage in conflict, it
may develop nuclear weapons to keep fighting, or to prepare for, that
conflict.]{.underline} If this selection effect existed, the analysis
should overestimate the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear
proliferation in the above model. Still, the [results indicate that a
larger number of nuclear states are associated with fewer disputes in
the system.]{.underline}

This conclusion, however, raises questions about how to reconcile this
study's findings with those of a recent quantitative dyadic-level study
(Bell and Miller, 2015). [The current paper finds that nuclear
proliferation **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict, while Bell and Miller (2015) find that nuclear symmetry has no
significant effect on dyadic conflict, but that nuclear asymmetry is
associated with a higher probability of dyadic conflict. It is possible
that nuclear proliferation **decreases conflict** through the
conflict-mitigating effects of extended nuclear deterrence and/or fear
of nuclear states' intervention, to the extent that these effects
**overwhelm** the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear--asymmetrical
dyads]{.underline}. Thus, dyadic-level empirics cannot solely be relied
on to infer causal links between nuclear proliferation and a systemic
propensity for conflict. The systemic-level empirics deserve attention.

### No Deterrence !

#### **Nuclear deterrence is [academic]{.underline}, pundit, and logical [garbage]{.underline}**

**Barash 18** (David P. Barash - professor of psychology emeritus at the
University of Washington, "Nuclear deterrence is a myth. And a lethal
one at that", The Guardian, 14 January 2018,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash>,
MG)

[Advocates of nuclear deterrence insist that we should thank it for the
fact that a third world war has been avoided, even when tensions between
the two superpowers -- the US and the USSR -- ran high.]{.underline}

Some supporters even maintain that deterrence set the stage for the fall
of the Soviet Union and the defeat of Communism. In this telling, the
West's nuclear deterrent prevented the USSR from invading western
Europe, and delivered the world from the threat of Communist tyranny.

There are, however, compelling arguments suggesting that the US and the
former Soviet Union avoided world war for several possible reasons, most
notably because neither side wanted to go to war. Indeed, the US and
Russia never fought a war prior to the nuclear age. Singling out nuclear
weapons as the reason why the Cold War never became hot is somewhat like
saying that a junkyard car, without an engine or wheels, never sped off
the lot only because no one turned the key. [Logically speaking, there
is **no way** to demonstrate that nuclear weapons kept the peace during
the Cold War, or that they do so now.]{.underline}

Perhaps peace prevailed between the two superpowers simply because they
had no quarrel that justified fighting a terribly destructive war, even
a conventional one.

There is no evidence, for example, that the Soviet leadership ever
contemplated trying to conquer western Europe, much less that it was
restrained by the West's nuclear arsenal. [Post facto arguments --
especially negative ones -- might be the **currency of pundits**, but
are impossible to prove, and offer no solid ground for evaluating a
counterfactual claim, conjecturing why something has not
happened.]{.underline}

[In colloquial terms, if a dog does not bark in the night, can we say
with certainty that no one walked by the house? Deterrence enthusiasts
are like the woman who sprayed perfume on her lawn every morning. When a
perplexed neighbour asked about this strange behaviour, she replied: 'I
do it to keep the elephants away.' The neighbour protested: 'But there
aren't any elephants within 10,000 miles of here,' whereupon the
perfume-sprayer replied: 'You see, it works!']{.underline}

[The only way to make sure nuclear weapons are not used is to make sure
there are no such weapons]{.underline}

[We should **not congratulate** our leaders, or deterrence theory, much
less nuclear weapons, for keeping the peace.]{.underline}

What we can say is that, as of this morning, those with the power to
exterminate life have not done so. But this is not altogether
comforting, and history is no more reassuring. The duration of 'nuclear
peace', from the Second World War to the end of the Cold War, lasted
less than five decades. More than 20 years separated the First and
Second World Wars; before that, there had been more than 40 years of
relative peace between the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871) and the
First World War (1914), and 55 years between the Franco-Prussian War and
Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo (1815).

Even in war-prone Europe, decades of peace have not been so rare. Each
time, when peace ended and the next war began, the war involved weapons
available at the time -- which, for the next big one, would likely
include nuclear weapons. The only way to make sure that nuclear weapons
are not used is to make sure that there are no such weapons. [There is
**certainly no reason** to think that the presence of nuclear weapons
will prevent their use. The first step to ensuring that humans do not
unleash nuclear holocaust might be to show that the **Emperor Deterrence
has no clothes** --]{.underline} which would then open the possibility
of replacing the illusion with something more suitable.

It is possible that the post-1945 US-Soviet peace came 'through
strength', but that need not imply nuclear deterrence. [It is also
undeniable that the presence of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert
capable of reaching each other's homeland in minutes has made both sides
edgy.]{.underline}

The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 -- when, by all accounts, the world
came closer to nuclear war than at any other time -- is not testimony to
the effectiveness of deterrence: the crisis occurred because of nuclear
weapons. It is more likely that we have been spared nuclear war not
because of deterrence but in spite of it.

[Even when possessed by just one side, nuclear weapons have **not
deterred** other forms of war]{.underline}. The Chinese, Cuban, Iranian
and Nicaraguan revolutions all took place even though a nuclear-armed US
backed the overthrown governments. Similarly, the US lost the Vietnam
War, just as the Soviet Union lost in Afghanistan, despite both
countries not only possessing nuclear weapons, but also more and better
conventional arms than their adversaries. Nor did nuclear weapons aid
Russia in its unsuccessful war against Chechen rebels in 1994-96, or in
1999-2000, when Russia's conventional weapons devastated the suffering
Chechen Republic.

[Nuclear weapons did **not help** the US achieve its goals in Iraq or
Afghanistan,]{.underline} which have become expensive catastrophic
failures for the country with the world's most advanced nuclear weapons.
Moreover[, despite its nuclear arsenal, the US remains fearful of
domestic terrorist attacks, which are more likely to be made with
nuclear weapons than be deterred by them.]{.underline}

[In short, it is **not legitimate** to argue that nuclear weapons have
deterred any sort of war, or that they will do so in the
future.]{.underline} During the Cold War, each side engaged in
conventional warfare: the Soviets, for example, in Hungary (1956),
Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1979-89); the Russians in
Chechnya (1994-96; 1999-2009), Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014-present),
as well as Syria (2015-present); and the US in Korea (1950-53), Vietnam
(1955-75), Lebanon (1982), Grenada (1983), Panama (1989-90), the Persian
Gulf (1990-91), the former Yugoslavia (1991-99), Afghanistan
(2001-present), and Iraq (2003-present), to mention just a few cases.

[Nor have their weapons deterred attacks upon nuclear armed states by
non-nuclear opponents]{.underline}. In 1950, China stood 14 years from
developing and deploying its own nuclear weapons, whereas the US had a
well-developed atomic arsenal. Nonetheless, as the Korean War's tide was
shifting dramatically against the North, that US nuclear arsenal did not
inhibit China from sending more than 300,000 soldiers across the Yalu
River, resulting in the stalemate on the Korean peninsula that divides
it to this day, and has resulted in one of the world's most dangerous
unresolved stand-offs.

In 1956, the nuclear-armed United Kingdom warned non-nuclear Egypt to
refrain from nationalising the Suez Canal. To no avail: the UK, France
and Israel ended up invading Sinai with conventional forces. In 1982,
Argentina attacked the British-held Falkland Islands, even though the UK
had nuclear weapons and Argentina did not.

Following the US-led invasion in 1991, conventionally armed Iraq was not
deterred from lobbing Scud missiles at nuclear-armed Israel, which did
not retaliate, although it could have used its nuclear weapons to
vaporise Baghdad. It is hard to imagine how doing so would have
benefitted anyone. Obviously, US nuclear weapons did not deter the
terrorist attacks on the US of 11 September 2001, just as the nuclear
arsenals of the UK and France have not prevented repeated terrorist
attacks on those countries.

[Nuclear weapons **didn't** escalate demands; if anything, such
countries were **less successful** in getting their way]{.underline}

[Deterrence, in short, **does not deter**.]{.underline}

### Norms Check

#### **[NPT]{.underline} and [norms]{.underline} check prolif**

**McGlinchey 22** (Stephen McGlinchey PhD - Senior Lecturer in
International Relations at the University of the West of England,
"Nuclear Weapons and International Relations", E-International
Relations, 27 March 2022, <https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/96250>, MG)

[The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1970) -- often
known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty -- sought to channel nuclear
technology into civilian uses and to recognise the destabilising effect
of further nuclear proliferation. It was a triumph of
diplomacy.]{.underline} The genius of the treaty was that it was aware
of the realities of the international politics of the time. It was not a
disarmament treaty as great powers would simply not give up their
nuclear weapons, fearful their security would be diminished. So, instead
of pursuing an impossible goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, the
Treaty sought to freeze the number of nations that had nuclear weapons
at the five states that already possessed them. Simultaneously, those
five nations were encouraged to share non-military nuclear technology
with other states -- such as nuclear energy and nuclear medicine -- so
that others would not feel tempted to pursue nuclear weapons. In short,
those who had nuclear weapons could keep them. Those who did not have
them would be allowed to benefit from the non-military research and
innovation of the existing nuclear powers.

[Due to the well-considered design of the treaty and its enforcement, it
has been **highly successful**. Following the end of the Cold War, the
Non-Proliferation Treaty was permanently extended in 1995. Granted, it
has not kept the number of nuclear nations to five, but **there are
still fewer than ten** -- which is far from the twenty or more projected
before the treaty entered into force. States with nascent nuclear
weapons programmes, such as Brazil and South Africa, gave them up due to
**international pressure**. Today, only a small number of states are
outside its bounds. India, Pakistan and Israel never joined as they
(controversially in each case) had nuclear ambitions that they were not
prepared to give up due to national security priorities.]{.underline}
Underlining the weight of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in 2003, when
North Korea decided to rekindle earlier plans to develop nuclear
weapons, they withdrew from the treaty rather than violate it. To date,
North Korea remains the only state to withdraw from the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

[The non-proliferation regime is not perfect, of course -- a situation
best underlined today by North Korea]{.underline}. It is also a system
with an inherent bias, since a number of states are allowed to have
nuclear weapons simply because they were among the first to develop
them, and this continues to be the case regardless of their behaviour.
[Yet, while humankind has developed the ultimate weapon in the nuclear
bomb, **diplomacy has managed to prevail** in moderating its spread.
When a state is rumoured to be developing a nuclear bomb, as in the case
of North Korea, the reaction of the international community is always
one of **common alarm**. We call ideas that have become commonplace
'norms' and **non-proliferation has become one of the central norms**
within our global system.]{.underline}

### U -- No US Cred Now

#### **US credibility was being questioned [before]{.underline} Ukraine -- dependence on the US is [way low]{.underline}**

**Kluth 6/20** (Andreas Kluth - Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering
European politics, "Europe Needs a Better Nuclear Deterrent Against
Putin", The Washington Post, 20 June 2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/europe-needs-a-better-nuclear-deterrent-against-putin/2022/06/20/9f3c2e1c-f064-11ec-ac16-8fbf7194cd78_story.html>,
MG)

[During most of the Cold War and the years since, that question seemed
settled. The European NATO members are meant to shelter under America's
nuclear "umbrella]{.underline}." As part of the transatlantic alliance's
"nuclear sharing," five partner countries --- Belgium, the Netherlands,
Germany, Italy and Turkey --- host an estimated 100 American nukes on
their soil. To retaliate against a Russian strike, the allies would be
able to drop these US bombs from their own planes.

Aside from those American weapons, France and the UK also have their own
arsenals. But France has always kept its nukes outside the joint
strategizing of the Western alliance --- it's the only nation among
NATO's 30 member states not to participate in the alliance's Nuclear
Planning Group.

[**Even before** **Putin's war of aggression** against Ukraine this
year, some Europeans worried that the American umbrella was becoming
**less reliable**, and thus by definition less of a deterrent. The US
has shifted its geopolitical focus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
specifically toward containing China, which is now adding to its arsenal
fast.]{.underline}

Washington therefore has to hold up two nuclear umbrellas and plan for
two simultaneous wars. Scholars such as Maximilian Terhalle in Germany
and Francois Heisbourg in France have been warning that Washington,
forced to choose, would probably give priority to its commitments in
Asia, and to allies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

[Worse, former US President Donald Trump spooked Europeans when he
questioned NATO's mutual-defense clause and even contemplated taking the
US out of the alliance. Trump is gone for now. But he, or a president
like him, **could return**. In the long run, the US **appears less
dependable** as a protector than it used to be.]{.underline}

[Topping all that, Putin has now gone rhetorically ballistic by dropping
not-so-veiled threats that he might use nukes against Ukraine or Western
countries that interfere in his war]{.underline}. The consensus for now
is that he's bluffing. But from the Baltic to Poland and beyond,
Europeans would love to know what the back-up plan is.

### U -- Nuke Prolif Now

#### **Prolif [started]{.underline} already** 

**Maire 6/19** (Tania Gemma Maire - final year bachelor's student in
Asian Studies & Management at the University of Applied Sciences in
Konstanz, "The New Nuclear Arms Race", Modern Diplomacy, 19 June 2022,
<https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/06/19/the-new-nuclear-arms-race/>, MG)

For decades, the world has been focusing on disarmament and reducing the
number of nuclear weapons in circulation. Especially the main actors
mentioned above were dedicated to promoting different treaties to avoid
the spread. [However, these public announcements, coming from wealthy,
powerful nations in possession of such arms are contradictory to the
**current trend in nuclear proliferation** (Al Jazeera
2022).]{.underline}

[Even more surprising is the fact that the idea of disarmament has
suddenly disappeared after the Russian attack on Ukraine. In fact, in a
matter of months, actors in possession of nuclear weapons have
**announced to invest in nuclear arms** in order to increase, modernize
and optimize their arsenal. Countries that wanted to get rid of nuclear
arms **are now putting strong importance** on the capability of their
weapons. Russia's threat of using nuclear weapons against Ukraine has
provoked a common global reaction to get ready for potential danger (Al
Jazeera 2022).]{.underline}

[Therefore, it seems like Russia's war has **already activated** a
nuclear proliferation trend, stronger and faster than in the past
decades. A new nuclear arms race has started]{.underline}, altough this
time it is not about technological capability and artificial
intelligence. This time it is about being prepared and ready for a
potential attack from a country possessing the world's largest nuclear
arsenal (Hille 2022).

### U -- Allies Won't Prolif

#### **Allies have [no incentive]{.underline} to go nuclear -- assumes [nuclear guarantees]{.underline}**

Korb and **Cimbala 4/17** (Lawrence J. Korb -  senior fellow at the
Center for American Progress and a former Assistant Secretary of
Defense, Stephen J. Cimbala - Distinguished Professor of Political
Science at Penn State University, "Nuclear Proliferation Is Not the
Answer to the War in Ukraine", National Interest, 17 April 2021,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nuclear-proliferation-not-answer-war-ukraine-201862>,
MG)

[States may **not gain much** from going nuclear, even if they live in a
dangerous regional neighborhood and fear aggression or coercion from one
or more of their neighbors. The threshold for the use of nuclear weapons
is quite high, and most military coercion takes place at lower levels.
**Advanced conventional weapons**, including smart drones, long-range
precision strike missiles, and network-centric battle management may be
as important in deterring prospective attackers as is a small nuclear
arsenal. For countries such as Japan, South Korea, or Australia, for
example, building and deploying next-generation conventional weapons,
along with regional cooperation and U.S. support, could pay **greater
dividends in deterrence** than joining the growing list of nuclear
weapons states. Conventional weapons often deter because they can
actually win a war at an acceptable cost, whereas nuclear weapons only
deter if the threat of use---and prospect of mutual annihilation---is
credible.]{.underline}

[Considering the downside costs of regional nuclear arms
races---including **massive financial costs, increased risks of
proliferation or accidents, and potential sanctions**---it is doubtful
that **any state** in the Middle East or the Indo-Pacific will improve
their security by developing nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Instead, a
growing number of states with small- or medium-sized nuclear arsenals
will create more anxieties about the first-strike vulnerability of those
forces. Few of these prospective nuclear weapons states can afford a
fleet of ballistic missile submarines, currently the most survivable
platforms among operationally deployed launch systems. These countries
will therefore depend almost exclusively on aircraft or missiles that
are less survivable and require their commanders to preempt their
opponents. More states will deploy more forces, fears of a surprise
attack will multiply, and the need for survivable counter-strike
capabilities will lead to more nuclear weapons deployed on a "hair
trigger."

[Although Russia's war against Ukraine might lead some to conclude that
nukes are a prescription for safety, the **opposite is more likely to be
true**. Nuclear deterrence]{.underline} in a post-post-Cold War world
[is less dependable than it was]{.underline} during the Cold War
[because: first, the stability provided by U.S.-Soviet strategic nuclear
bipolarity is gone; second, some hot zones such as Asia are already
overcrowded with nuclear state actors whose leaders have no democratic
accountability; and, third, leaders with or without nuclear weapons are
perfectly willing to act in ways that some might judge as "irrational"
according to their own definitions of victory. In this environment,
**nuclear guarantees might turn from deterrents into black
holes**.]{.underline}

### AT Funding Tradeoff

#### Nuclear weapons are untouchable

William **Hartung**, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Center for International Policy, April 21, **2020**

"Now isn't the time to push for nuclear modernization," Army Times,
[https://www.armytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/21/now-isnt-the-time-to-push-for-nuclear-modernization/](https://www.armytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/21/now-isnt-the-time-to-push-for-nuclear-modernization/?contentFeatureId=f0fmoahPVC2AbfL-2-1-8&contentQuery=%7B%22section%22%3A%22%2Fhome%22%2C%22exclude%22%3A%22%2Fopinion%2Fcommentary%22%2C%22from%22%3A5%2C%22size%22%3A10%7D),

Eliminating ICBMs and [reducing the size of the U.S. arsenal will face
strong opposition in Washington, both from strategists who maintain that
the nuclear triad should be sacrosanct, and from special interests that
benefit from excess spending on nuclear weapons. The Senate
ICBM]{.underline} Coalition, composed of senators from states with ICBM
bases or substantial ICBM development and maintenance work, [has been
particularly effective in fending any changes in]{.underline} ICBM
[policy, from reducing the size of the force to merely studying
alternatives, whether those alternatives are implemented or]{.underline}
not. Meanwhile, [Northrop Grumman]{.underline} --- currently the sole
bidder for the new ICBM program --- [has announced that it expects to
have hundreds of subcontractors spread throughout the United States for
its work on the new system]{.underline}, known formally as the
Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. The company also claims that the next
phase of the work could create 10,000 jobs. [That's a tiny fraction of
national employment but will pack a political punch among members of
Congress whose states or districts benefit from ICBM-related
employment]{.underline}.

#### The nuclear industry will block cuts

Richard and other [senior officers]{.underline} know this, which is why
[they're pulling out all the stops in making the case for new
nukes]{.underline}. This week's [hearings marked the first public
roll-out of the arguments, but they've been rehearsed in trade journals
and conferences for some time now]{.underline}. Last fall, the Trump
administration awarded Northrop Grumman a \$13.3 billion sole-source
contract to start developing the new ICBM, in an attempt to lock in the
project and make it harder for anyone to kill it outright. [Northrop
Grumman had lined up more than a dozen subcontractors---including
Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, which are normally its chief
competitors---in order to widen support in Congress]{.underline}. [There
will be fierce resistance to any slowdown of the strategic juggernaut.
Most members of the congressional armed services committees regard the
Nuclear Triad with the same veneration that Catholics bestow to the Holy
Trinity]{.underline}. When they ask a witness if he believes in the
Triad, they do so with a quivering tone, as if they were priests asking
a supplicant if he believes in God.

### AT: Turkey

#### **No Turkey Prolif or [inevitable]{.underline} -- tons of alt causes** 

**Eldridge 11** (William G. Eldridge -- United States Air Force
Commander, "The Credibility of America's Extended Nuclear Deterrent The
Case of the Republic of Turkey", Air University Press, September 2011,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Papers/wp_0018_eldridge_extended_nuclear_deterrent.pdf>,
MG)

[Turkey likely will "tip" if Middle East nuclear proliferation becomes
widespread **and** NATO is perceived as ineffective **and** if
US-Turkish relationships collapse. According to one Turkish diplomat,
"**things would have to get really bad**" for Turkey to pursue its own
nuclear weapons. Despite a rocky history, current NATO-Turkish and
US-Turkish relations **remain fundamentally sound**]{.underline}, but
leadership or regional security changes could strain those
relationships. [Factors working against Turkish nuclear weapons
proliferation include the lack of support by **senior Turkish leaders**,
the high value Turkey places on **alliance relationships**, the **lack
of funding** for civilian or military nuclear programs, and Turkish
**treaty agreements** forswearing nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Despite these proliferation disincentives, Turkey will probably hedge
against falling behind a potential Middle East nuclear energy (or
nuclear arms) race by developing a civilian nuclear power program. As
Iran continues pursuing nuclear enrichment and possibly a nuclear
weapon, Turkey will likely begin to develop a nuclear power program
beyond its current research stage. Turkish leaders do not fear an attack
from Iran, but instead they are concerned with the shift in the regional
balance of power that may result from a nuclear-armed Iran. Hedging with
civilian nuclear power provides scientific and engineering expertise
needed for an aggressive Turkish nuclear program if Iran's regional
influence increases or a broader Middle East nuclear arms race begins.
Therefore, the United States should continue its involvement in Turkey's
emerging civilian nuclear programs utilizing the existing 2008
US-Turkish nuclear cooperation agreement (123 Agreement), develop
additional cooperation agreements that encourage Turkey to forgo nuclear
and spent fuel processing, encourage scientific exchanges, and consider
financially supporting Turkey's civilian nuclear energy program. [The
credibility of US extended nuclear deterrence for Turkey is best
signaled **not** through US nuclear inventory types or numbers, but by
demonstrations of US political, economic, and **security relationships**
with Turkey. Turkey's most important political and security concerns
include]{.underline}

[• credibility of NATO,]{.underline} EU[, and US support for Turkish
security;]{.underline}

• Kurdish Workers Party [(PKK) terrorism;]{.underline}

[• Kurdish activism]{.underline} in Iraq supporting a separate Kurd
state;

• Cyprus;

• relations with [Iran and Armenia;]{.underline}

[• energy security]{.underline} and access; and

[• economic strength and domestic stability.]{.underline}

A close US-Turkish partnership that addresses these issues can
strengthen US credibility as a reliable ally. A strong US- Turkish
relationship also serves as a disincentive for Turkish nuclear weapons
acquisition.

#### **Turkey [isn't]{.underline} going to prolif**

**Ülgen 12** (Sinan Ülgen - visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in
Brussels where he researches the implications of Turkish foreign policy
for Europe and the United States, "TURKEY AND THE BOMB", The Carnegie
Papers, February 2012,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/files/turkey_bomb.pdf>, MG)

[Turkey has a stellar history of nonproliferation and has signed on to
**every** relevant IAEA and international instrument governing the
spread of nuclear technology.]{.underline} Moreover, it is a member of
NATO and an EU candidate country. [It is **unlikely**,]{.underline}
absent a rupture in relations with its NATO allies, a significant change
in its security environment, or a drastic reevaluation of Ankara's
immediate interests by the civilian leadership, [that Turkey would
consider developing nuclear weapons illicitly.]{.underline}

[A Turkish decision to proliferate would seriously complicate its
international standing, undermine its economic resurgence, and seriously
damage relations with the United States and its other NATO allies.
Moreover, any Turkish move toward weaponization would draw a harsh
rebuke from the United States and would likely be met by an American
proposal to strengthen security guarantees, as well as the threat of
sanctions if Turkey were to continue its weapons efforts. Given Turkey's
nonnuclear history and its long-standing reliance on the NATO security
guarantee, it is **hard to imagine a scenari**o where Turkey would
simply cast aside its policy in favor of an independent weapons
capability.]{.underline}

[Instead of developing its own nuclear weapons capability, Turkey seems
more interested in pursuing robust **conventional** capabilities that
could, in theory, replace some of the missions previously reserved for
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. To do so, Turkey has turned to foreign
suppliers but has also committed to begin designing and manufacturing
hightech weapons domestically. And it will likely continue to increase
its indigenous intelligence, surveillance, and information management
capabilities.26 Turkey's changing military posture is aimed at
countering the threats posed by nonstate actors and bolstering Turkey's
conventional war-fighting capabilities. [Interoperability with NATO
forces remains the key component of Turkey's defense policy and it is
**unlikely** that Ankara would threaten its union with its most
important allies.]{.underline}

#### **No middle east nuclear arms race impact -- assumes literally [every]{.underline} scenario**

**Cook 12** (Stephen A. Cook -  Eni Enrico Mattei senior fellow for
Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations,
"Don't Fear a Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East", Foreign Policy, 2
April 2012,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/04/02/dont-fear-a-nuclear-arms-race-in-the-middle-east/>,
MG)

[Most important to understanding why the Middle East **will not be a
zone of unrestrained proliferation** is the significant difference
between desiring nukes and the actual capacity to acquire them. Of all
three states that Shavit mentioned, the one on virtually everyone's list
for possible nuclear proliferation in response to Iran is
Turkey.]{.underline} But the Turkish Republic is already under a nuclear
umbrella: Ankara safeguards roughly 90 of the United States' finest B61
gravity bombs at Incirlik airbase, near the city of Adana. These weapons
are there because Turkey is a NATO member, and Washington's extended
deterrence can be expected to at least partially mitigate Turkey's
incentives for proliferation.

But [even if the Turks wanted their own bomb, they have almost **no
capacity** to develop nuclear weapons technology. Indeed, **Turkey**
does not even possess the capability to deliver the 40 B61 bombs at
Incirlik that are allocated to Turkish forces in the event of an
attack,]{.underline} according to a report released by the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.

[Given the changes in Turkey's foreign policy and its drive for global
influence, it is conceivable that it will want to develop a Turkish
version of France's force de frappe. However, Ankara would literally be
**starting from scratch**: Turkey has no fissile material, cannot mine
or enrich uranium, and does not possess the technology to reprocess
spent fuel, all of which are required for nuclear weapons
development.]{.underline}

This does not mean that Turkey is not interested in nuclear technology.
Yet Ankara's efforts, to the extent that they exist beyond the two
small-scale facilities in Ankara and Kucukcekmece, are directly related
to the country's predicted energy shortfall resulting from the
combination of a booming economy and growing population. The Turkish
government has announced plans for civilian nuclear power to provide a
quarter of Turkey's electricity needs by 2040. But even this
three-decade timeline seems overly optimistic given the inchoate nature
of Turkey's nuclear research.

The Egyptians are way ahead of the Turks in developing nuclear
infrastructure, but [don't expect to see the rise of a nuclear power on
the Nile anytime soon. Egypt's nuclear program is actually older than
India's]{.underline}, and was established only three years after Israel
founded its Atomic Energy Commission. The Egyptian Atomic Energy
Commission, which Gamal Abdel Nasser established in 1955, was
exclusively dedicated to the development of peaceful atomic energy,
though there were suspicions to the contrary. The 1956 nuclear
cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union transferred to Egypt a
2-megawatt light water reactor that only produced small amounts of
plutonium.

There were, of course, worrying signs about the Egyptian program ---
specifically Cairo's refusal to open the Inshas reactor to International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection until after the peace treaty with
Israel. Yet neither President Anwar Sadat nor his successor, the
recently deposed Hosni Mubarak, ever made any effort to develop nuclear
weapons technology. Sadat signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in
1980, and Mubarak negotiated with the United States, France, Canada, and
Germany for reactors and funding for Egypt's nuclear program. Nothing,
however, ever came of these discussions because of the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster --- and the fact that the Egyptians never signed what is known
as the Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA enhanced powers to
inspect nuclear facilities. Given the trajectory of Egypt's nuclear
development, Cairo's rejection of the Additional Protocol had more to do
with politics and sovereignty than plans for a clandestine weapons
program.

[Even after Mubarak's son Gamal triumphantly declared at the ruling
party's 2006 convention that Egypt was going to ramp up its nuclear
development program, it is hard to believe that Egyptians ever really
took him seriously]{.underline}. Mubarak spent \$160 million on
consultants to tell him where to build 10 planned nuclear power plants,
and selected a location along the Mediterranean for the first one. But
each of the power plants comes with a price tag of \$1.5 billion --- and
this is a country that in the last 15 months has spent approximately
\$26 billion of its \$36 billion foreign currency reserves just to stay
afloat.

[One has to wonder about the pundits' warning of an Egyptian bomb:
**Have they even been to Egypt lately**? If so, they might have a better
grasp of Egypt's **ramshackle infrastructure** and the **dire state of
its economy**, neither of which can support a nuclear
program.]{.underline}

[What about **Saudi Arabia**, then]{.underline}, the Sunni power that is
on the tip of most analysts' tongues when it comes to Shiite Iran
getting the bomb? Saudi Arabia has the cash to make large-scale
investments in nuclear technology. Indeed, the only factor that makes
warnings about Saudi proliferation --- such as that delivered by former
Ambassador the United States Prince Turki al-Faisal last year --- even
remotely credible is the resources the Saudis can muster to buy a
nuclear program. [Yet, while Riyadh can outfit itself with nuclear
facilities with ease, it does **not have the capacity to manage
them**]{.underline}. Mohamed Khilewi, a former Saudi diplomat, claims
that the kingdom has been developing a nuclear arsenal to counter Israel
since the mid-1970s --- but he offers no substantiated evidence to
support these claims.

[In fact, the country has no nuclear facilities and no scientific
infrastructure to support them.]{.underline} It's possible that Saudi
Arabia could import Pakistanis to do the work for them. But while Saudis
feel comfortable with Pakistanis piloting some of their warplanes and
joining their ground forces, [setting up a nuclear program subcontracted
with Pakistani know-how --- or even acquiring a nuclear device directly
from Islamabad --- poses a range of **political risks** for the House
of]{.underline} [Saud]{.underline}. No doubt there would be considerable
international opprobrium. Certainly Washington, which implicitly extends
its nuclear umbrella to Saudi Arabia, would have a jaundiced view of a
nuclear deal between Riyadh and Islamabad. Moreover, it's one thing to
hand the keys to an F-15 over to a foreigner, but letting them run your
nuclear program is another matter altogether.

The concern about Saudi proliferation stems from fears that the kingdom
would be forced to act if both Iran and Israel possessed a nuclear
arsenal. \"We cannot live in a situation where Iran has nuclear weapons
and we don't,\" an unnamed Saudi official declared to the Guardian on
the sidelines of a meeting between Prince Turki al Faisal and NATO
officials in June 2011. \"It's as simple as that. If Iran develops a
nuclear weapon, that will be unacceptable to us and we will have to
follow suit.\"

Yet given the fact that the Saudis have very little nuclear
infrastructure to speak of, this kind of statement is little more than
posturing designed to force the U.S. hand on Iran. Unlike similar
warnings by Israel, which has the capacity to follow through on its
threat to attack Iran's nuclear sites, [Riyadh's rhetoric about
acquiring nuclear weapons is **empty**]{.underline}. What is amazing is
how many people take the Saudis seriously. If Khilewi had been telling
the truth, now would seem like a good time for the Riyadh to give Tehran
a look at what the royal family has been hiding in the palace basement
all these years --- but so far, we have only heard crickets.

Despite its flimsiness, it is hard to ignore the utility of the Middle
East's nuclear dominoes theory. For those who advocate a preventive
military strike on Iran, it provides a sweeping geopolitical rationale
for a dangerous operation. But the evidence doesn't bear this argument
out: If Washington decides it has no other option than an attack, it
should do so because Iran is a threat in its own right, and not because
it belives it will thwart inevitable proliferation in places like
[Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. It won't, for the simple reason that
there is **no reason** to believe these countries represent a
proliferation risk in the first place.]{.underline}
