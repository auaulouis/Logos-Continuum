[What this [war]{.mark} is [destroying]{.mark} is the **[future of
Russia]{.mark}** and its people **know it**]{.underline}. The war in
[[Ukraine]{.mark} is likely to [produce]{.mark} **immense
[discontent]{.mark}** in Russia]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
therefore [[a]{.mark}n **immense [problem]{.mark}** [for
Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} who, like all dictators, fears first and
foremost his own people.

[Even before the war]{.underline}, the [[Russian population]{.mark} was
**[divided]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the issue: A poll showed that [50
percent of Russians were supportive of a military
intervention]{.underline}. But [that was **before** the **all-out
attack** on Ukraine]{.underline}, the shelling of civilians, the
numerous Russian casualties, the international condemnation, the effect
of the sanctions, the tumble of the ruble, and the threat of a nuclear
war. It is an assumption, but it seems a safe one, that today the
opinion of the Russian population has changed, as a number of signs
suggest. [Since the beginning]{.underline} of the offensive,
**[demonstrations]{.underline}** have been [organized **all over** the
country]{.underline}. Thousands took to the streets in support of
Ukraine, in dozens of cities. Tags "No to the war" appeared everywhere,
and the few remaining independent media in the country displayed their
opposition to the conflict and their support for the Ukrainian people.
[Even the **[political consensus]{.mark}** began to
**[crack]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [Three members of the Russian
Parliament]{.underline}, from the Communist Party, who had voted in
favor of recognizing the separatist enclaves, [are now **criticizing**
the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. The [[war]{.mark} will be a
[**catalyst** for]{.mark} **Russian [opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Russian state is too repressive for this change in popular opinion
to lead to major uprisings. More than 5,900 protesters were arrested in
at least 60 cities in four days and, aware of the danger, the regime is
likely to further increase internal repression. On Feb. 25, former
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev proposed to take advantage of Russia's
expulsion from the Council of Europe to reintroduce the death penalty.
And, two days later, the prosecutor general's office issued a statement
saying that any type of "assistance to a foreign state, international or
foreign organization or their representatives in activities directed
against the security of the Russian Federation" would be prosecuted
under "high treason" charges. Those are signals to the population that,
to ensure its survival, the regime is ready to take ever more radical
measures. [The [war]{.mark} [will]{.mark} logically
**[radicalize]{.mark}** the **[dictatorship]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
**aggravate** the **repression**]{.underline}. That is neither good news
for the Russian population, nor for Putin, [as [he will]{.mark} lose
some of the **[popular support]{.mark}** he built up over the past two
decades]{.underline}.

[More worrying]{.underline} for him [is the [discontent]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the Russian **[economic]{.mark}
[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [who will **lose** a lot of **money** to
his adventurism]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that [[presents]{.mark}
a **[real]{.mark} [risk]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[fragmentation]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a regime that until now
maintained subtle balances. [With]{.underline} "[his]{.underline}"
[war]{.underline}, [Putin is making enemies from
**within**]{.underline}, including very powerful oligarchs who will pay
the price of his dreams of grandeur. Adding to this are the nuclear
threats that he may be willing to carry out, but most of his entourage,
who are supposedly more reasonable, probably would not.

[The **logical [conclusion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} all this is that the
**[resentment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and hostility and fear [that Putin
**generates** within the **Russian elite** [constitutes]{.mark} a real
[risk]{.mark} [for]{.mark} his **[maintenance]{.mark}** [in
**power**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the coming weeks, months, and years.
[The [probability]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a **palace [coup]{.mark}** or an
**oligarchic revolt** [is]{.mark} **[substantial]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There may come a point where it [appears]{.mark} to the
population]{.underline} and the economic, military, and security elite,
including within the Kremlin, [that the [only way to **save
Russia**]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to **[get rid of
Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This war is his greatest error of
judgement and could be his undoing. That is why I wrote that it will be
"the beginning of the end" --- his end.

[[Consider]{.mark} the Worst Case]{.underline}

**[[Putin lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He cornered himself. But [this is
**no good news** because **he knows it**]{.underline}. [[Seeing]{.mark}
that [he]{.mark}]{.underline} has [overestimated his forces]{.underline}
in Ukraine [and underestimated]{.underline} the [international
reaction]{.underline}, i.e., [that he is **[losing]{.mark}
[control]{.mark}** of the situation]{.underline}, [[Putin]{.mark} may
[want to regain]{.mark} the initiative [by]{.mark}
[escalating]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He may]{.underline} actually
[think]{.underline} that [the only way out from this mess]{.underline}
for him [is to **escalate**]{.underline}. [He [can do]{.mark}
[this]{.mark} [in **many ways**]{.mark}]{.underline} but here are three
potential scenarios.

An Attack on a NATO Member

[[Russia]{.mark} could [accuse]{.mark} a **[NATO member]{.mark}** state
of **supplying** **arms** or **intel**]{.underline}ligence, [of
protecting **Zelensky**]{.underline} or members of his
**[government]{.underline}**, [of a]{.underline} fabricated attack ([a
**false flag operation**]{.underline}), [[and]{.mark} [attack]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} a [**border** incident]{.mark}]{.underline} (for
example by bombing an arms convoy at the Polish border), [[or]{.mark} a
**[skirmish]{.mark}** in the **sky** or]{.underline} in the **[Black
Sea]{.underline}**. [If [Russia]{.mark} [attack]{.mark}s a member
state]{.underline} it is [likely to]{.underline} simultaneously
[[signal]{.mark} the **[nuclear threat]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[hopes]{.mark} [of **deterring**]{.mark} **[Article 5]{.mark}
solidarity**]{.underline}.

Brutalizing Ukraine

[[Russia]{.mark}n forces are **already [escalating]{.mark}**
[because]{.mark} the **[first]{.mark} [phase]{.mark}** of the attack
**[failed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, [they will resort to more
shelling]{.underline}, [missiles]{.underline}, [tanks]{.underline},
perhaps [airstrikes]{.underline}, [and this [second phase]{.mark} will
be **[more devastating]{.mark}**]{.underline} for civilians. However,
[if even this does not work]{.underline} --- and considering that each
day that passes puts him in more danger with the appearance of a Russian
defeat, the international pressure and domestic concern ---
[[Putin]{.mark} may be [willing]{.mark} as a **last resort** [to
use]{.mark} a **[tactical]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon**]{.underline}. He could do it [under the pretext of retaliating
against a **staged attack**]{.underline}: [Moscow]{.underline} is
already starting to [**spread the rumor** that]{.underline} the
[Ukrainian]{.underline}s [might detonate a]{.underline} "**[dirty
bomb]{.underline}**" on Russian territory. [[In]{.mark} a]{.underline}
risky "**[[escalate to]{.mark} [de-escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**"
[[move]{.underline}]{.mark}, [by using a nuclear weapon]{.underline}
against Ukraine, [[Moscow]{.mark} would [signal]{.mark} its
[intention]{.mark} to **go all the way**]{.underline}, [hoping
[to]{.mark} **stun [NATO]{.mark}** and assuming that it will **not
dare** to escalate]{.underline}. A variation of this scenario would be
an attack on one of the 15 nuclear reactors Ukraine has, or a
destruction of Chernobyl's protective sarcophagus. Such an attack would
be staged so as to be blamed on the Ukrainian side, and from the
Kremlin's perspective the radioactive consequences could have the
advantage of rendering a portion of the Ukrainian territory unlivable
and therefore of turning it into a de facto buffer zone with the West.

A Diversion

[[Putin]{.mark} could]{.underline} also [[choose]{.mark} [to
**open**]{.mark} a **[new front]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It could be
[in]{.mark} the **[region]{.mark}**]{.underline} (for instance in the
Balkans), [[in **space**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([by attacking
satellites]{.underline} under the pretext that they are being used to
help the Ukrainian forces), **[[under sea]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([by
cutting internet cables]{.underline}), [[or]{.mark}
**[elsewhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, wherever you least expect it.
[[He]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [do it]{.mark} not only [to
**maximize**]{.mark} its [**chances** of **winning**]{.mark} for the
same cost]{.underline} (if he believes that international sanctions have
already reached their peak), [but [also]{.mark} [to]{.mark} create a
**diversion**]{.underline}, i.e., [to [hide]{.mark} what will be
a]{.underline} relative or [**[absolute failure]{.mark}** in
**Ukraine**]{.underline}. However, this hypothesis comes up against a
material and psychological reality. It is not at all certain that Russia
has the means for other ambitions, and above all it is not certain that
the generals --- some of whom, it can be assumed, were already not in
favor of the Ukrainian adventure --- follow Putin elsewhere, which would
only increase his frustration.

The worst-case scenario is improbable but not impossible, as is the risk
of major war in general. [[As Putin]{.mark} is visibly [locked]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} a [paranoid]{.mark} and hubristic
[delirium]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[nothing]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [be
excluded]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is also in this tragic sense that
[this [could be]{.mark} the **[beginning]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the
end]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[No matter]{.mark} [how]{.mark}]{.underline} the war in
[[Ukraine]{.mark} [plays out]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[Putin
loses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Even if Russian forces prevail on the
ground]{.underline} and in the air, he loses. [Even if he takes Kyiv
tomorrow]{.underline}, **[he loses]{.underline}**. [[Russia
**lacks**]{.mark} the **[forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[and]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [the **[will]{.mark}**]{.underline})
[[to occupy]{.mark} Ukraine]{.underline} in the face of a restive civil
society and guerrilla movement. And [that would be [on top]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} having already **[reinforced NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[awakened Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[isolated]{.mark}** his
[country]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[ruined]{.mark}** its
**[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and **alienated** many
Russians]{.underline}, including his "friends." What happens next
depends less on the military outcome of the conflict than on other
factors he has already put in motion and that will further affect him.
It might seem presumptuous in the first week of a war to predict its
outcome and second-order effects for Ukraine, Russia, and the West, but
it seems [Putin's defeat is the **likely product** of five
factors]{.underline}: [the **[heavy price]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a
**prospective** military **[victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
**[quagmire]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an
**[occupation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the [**strengthening** of]{.mark}
**[NATO]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[Europe]{.mark}an**
defense]{.underline}, [the **international [isolation]{.mark}** of
Russia]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the **[internal]{.mark}
[contestation]{.mark}** which]{.underline} may [[lead to]{.mark}
[Putin's]{.mark} [fall]{.mark}]{.underline}. So Putin lost, but it does
not mean we win. He knows that he cornered himself and this is precisely
where it gets dangerous because he may think that the only way out for
him is to escalate.
