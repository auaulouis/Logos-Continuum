### PDCP

#### Security cooperation includes development of economic capabilities

TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### The private sector and military can work together.

Together,"

The internet, microwaves, and synthetic rubber came into our lives as
products invented for military purposes. Even everyday things, such as
undershirts and concentrated fruit juice were created to improve the
combat readiness of armed forces. Though many people typically associate
the military with war and suffering, this industry has been a source of
incredible progress, producing inventions that made our lives longer,
healthier, and easier. These days, innovation is likely to run the other
way, with [the military benefiting from inventions developed with
private funding]{.underline}. [A symbiotic relationship between military
needs and human progress is not necessarily the default]{.underline}.
Instead, [it requires a well-oiled innovation ecosystem in which
military and civilian industries share their expertise and knowledge
with one another]{.underline}. NATO has recently announced several
initiatives to build on past success, but more are needed---particularly
as members increase their military funding. Virtually all alliance
members are investing more in defense or are soon planning to do so.
Germany, for example, declared that it would create a 100-billion-Euro
fund and reach its 2% goal in 2022. Poland, which shares the longest EU
border with Ukraine, has taken in more than 3.5 million Ukrainian
refugees and promised to dedicate 3% of its GDP to defense. Croatia
ramped up its defense investment to 2.3% of GDP. To ensure that this new
investment spurs innovation and co-operation between military and
civilian industries as well as academia, [NATO announced in April the
Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic]{.underline}.
[DIANA will concentrate on deep technologies, including artificial
intelligence, big-data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
biotechnology, novel materials, and outer space]{.underline}. In
addition, 17 [NATO nations have agreed to set up the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund]{.underline}. It will invest 1
billion Euros in early-stage startups and other deep tech funds aligned
with its strategic objectives. But NATO members need to do more to
maintain their technological advantage over Russia and China, who are
also increasing spending on military research and development. The
trends make this clear. In 1960, the U.S. accounted for 69 percent of
global R&D investments, with U.S. defense-related R&D accounting for no
less than 36% of global spending. The bulk (65%) of U.S. investments in
defense-related R&D was financed from the federal budget. However, by
2019, the U.S. share of global R&D fell to 30%, and the share of federal
government investment in defense-related R&D fell from 65% to 21%,
whereas the share of business investment in R&D has grown from 33% to
71%. This leaves no doubt that [meaningful innovation is not possible
without close co-operation with the private sector]{.underline}. As NATO
prepares to adopt its next Strategic Concept at the summit in Madrid, it
is essential that it focus on mechanisms that maintain its technological
advantage. As part of GLOBSEC's work at the Future Security and Defense
Council, we have proposed several ideas to help promote innovation in
the Alliance. [We are convinced that NATO's innovation ecosystem must
integrate public and private sectors to ensure this edge]{.underline}.

### Solvency

#### The counterplan fails\-\-- the government and private sector don't trust each other.

Evelyn **Farkas** 08-11-20**11** \[Evelyn N. Farkas, Ph.D., Senior
Advisor for Public-Private Partnership to the Supreme Allied Commander
(SACEUR) and Commander, U.S. European Command, Atlantic Council,
"Public-Private Collaboration in NATO,"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/publicprivate-collaboration-in-nato///ZW\]

From Evelyn Farkas, U.S. European Command: "Why should the public and
private sectors collaborate today?" The answer? The complex challenges
that we face around the world today often require skills and approaches
beyond traditional military capabilities. Collaboration allows us to
meet these challenges utilizing specific expertise found in the private
sector. The private sector can provide agility, swift innovation, and a
unique resource set. Together, government and private entities can
reduce shared risks, minimize costs, and address mutual threats like
terrorism, organized crime, cyber attacks, and climate change. The
government gains access to the private sector's expertise and resources,
and private sector entities benefit from the information sharing
involved in collaboration and the legitimacy gained from meeting complex
challenges to provide for the greater good. . . . [NATO adopted a
comprehensive approach that recognized the need to build
partnerships]{.underline} with non-military entities both inside and
outside the government. With this in mind, [in 2008]{.underline}, [NATO
launched the Building Integrity Initiative,]{.underline} which works
with private NGOs like Transparency International, to reduce corruption
in defense establishments in Europe and Afghanistan. . . . [First, is
the issue of trust]{.underline}. [Neither sector likes to broadly share
information about vulnerabilities]{.underline}. [Corporations worry that
it could lead to the public revelation of weaknesses]{.underline} and of
sensitive intellectual property. [The government is cautious about
disclosing national security vulnerabilities to private
entities]{.underline} that have international ownership or global
interests and about safeguarding the privacy of U.S. citizens. And
[finally]{.underline}, [there is the problem of how to institutionalize
this collaboration]{.underline}. Because the responsibility for
advancing public-private collaboration is so decentralized,
[optimization and coordination of efforts across the government has
proven to be difficult]{.underline}.

### Impact Turn

#### Confronting China causes [overstretch]{.underline} and [escalation spirals]{.underline}. 

**Depetris** 8-18-20**20**, fellow at Defense Priorities and a columnist
at the Washington Examiner. (Daniel Depetris, \"China isn\'t the Soviet
Union, and the US needs to find a different way to compete\", *Business
Insider*,
https://www.businessinsider.com/us-needs-to-find-different-way-to-compete-with-china-2020-8)

Unfortunately, simplifying China as a modern-day Soviet Union
misdiagnoses the problem and leads to a faulty cure. [[Combatting
Chinese power **everywhere**]{.mark} and **anywhere** [will **exhaust
the US**, **deplete its resources** and **weaken US power**]{.mark} over
the long-term.]{.underline}

For nearly 30 years, the Washington foreign policy establishment has
gotten used to the United States being the paramount power in the global
system. But this is no longer the world we are living in.

[While the US is still the world\'s largest military and economic power,
China is a **close second**]{.underline}. Since the dawn of the century,
the Chinese economy has increased from \$1.2 trillion to \$14.3
trillion. [China\'s **exponential growth** has allowed the CCP to invest
additional resources into building up a **capable, modernized** and
**proficient military**, including a **world-class navy.**]{.underline}

With its frequent forays into Japanese waters, flyovers across the
Taiwan Straits, and trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative in Eurasia,
[China is doing what rising powers have done throughout history ---
translating its economic success into **geopolitical leverage**. A US
policy of [**containment** would have the **adverse affect** of
**heightening the**]{.mark} **sense of [alarmism]{.mark}** [in
Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The U.S. can and should compete with China economically. But it should
do so responsibly in order to prevent this competitiveness from drifting
into military affairs.

A decoupling from China, Washington\'s largest trading partner outside
of North America, is not a realistic proposal. A complete severance of
economic ties will produce unprecedented pain for middle-class Americans
and roil the international financial system.

[[A **military-to-military showdown**]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile,
[simply [**entrenches hardline positions** in]{.mark} both Washington
and [Beijing and **lessens the credibility** of]{.mark} those who call
for [**dialogue** and **deescalation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### China rise is [peaceful]{.underline} now\-\--encirclement makes it [fast]{.underline} and [hostile]{.underline}. 

**Goldstein 20**, associate professor in the Strategic Research
Department at the US Naval War College. (Lyle, 7-22-2020, \"China's
Putative Threat to U.S. National Security\", Published in *A Dangerous
World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security*,
https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/chinas-putative-threat-us-national-security)

Factions and interests on both the right and the left are now
disturbingly united in an effort to cast China as the next
multidimensional threat to the U.S.---on par with or even exceeding that
of the Soviet Union in its dimensions. Many of those interests,
moreover, are poised to profit from such a characterization. A few
obvious facts, however, are worth repeating when considering the
putative threat posed by China to U.S. national security: [[China has
**not resorted** to **any**]{.mark} **significant [use of
force]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **more than [three decades]{.mark}**[, it
has **no foreign bases**, and]{.mark} it [remains]{.mark} rather
**[weak]{.mark}**]{.underline} (compared with U.S. forces) [[in]{.mark}
the domains of [**power projection** and **nuclear war
fighting**]{.mark}. In the coming decades, all of [those metrics may
**reverse**, and China could **morph**]{.mark}]{.underline} from a
bungling, paranoid panda [[into a
**fire‐​breathing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, goose‐​stepping
**[[dragon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It seems likely that [Beijing will
have the]{.mark} **requisite [resources]{.mark}**, **bureaucratic
[discipline]{.mark}**[, and **talent** to make such a
transition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [it is **not short** of
strategists advocating for more aggressive steps to counter the United
States]{.underline}.41 [[Washington's]{.mark} overall [goal should be to
**forestall that metamorphosis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in part [by
**acknowledging** China's security concerns and]{.mark} by **[seeking
compromises]{.mark}** on the many issues that divide the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline}, as
outlined in the previous section. It is worth reiterating that [Beijing
is planning neither to **attack** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [nor to **conquer East Asia**]{.underline}. Rather,
[its foreign policy behavior has]{.underline}, by and large, [comported
itself well with current international norms]{.underline}---in rather
stark contrast to Moscow's much more confrontational approach toward the
West.

#### US retrenchment prevents war from status competition and gives China a peaceful stake in the [current]{.underline} order 

**Ward, 17** - Assistant Professor of Government at Cornell University
(Steven, [Status and the Challenge of Rising Powers]{.underline}, p.
217-218

The former approach is one that few policymakers and scholars openly
promote.23 [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
interested in avoiding the creation of a deeply revisionist,
anti-Western China, it needs to accommodate China's status
claims]{.underline}. Since these likely include the right to a sphere of
influence in East Asia, [accommodation would likely have to involve a
reduction of the American military presence and American
influence]{.underline} in that region. This does not mean conceding
global leadership to China. Rather, the aim would be to acknowledge that
China, as a great power, deserves the same rights that the United States
does in world politics -- including the right to manage East Asia and
the South China Sea the way that the United States manages Latin America
and the Caribbean.

This approach carries with it great risks and costs as well.What would
be the effect on navigation and trade through the South China Sea? Would
important American allies like Japan and South Korea turn into Beijing's
vassals? What if an American withdrawal from East Asia produces a
regional arms race? And what if China grows more ambitious rather than
more satisfied as the United States withdraws overseas?

But accommodation/[retrenchment]{.underline} also has some important
advantages. Foremost among them is that it **[avoids antagonizing
Beijing]{.underline}**: it is premised upon the idea that, all else
equal, [accommodation is preferable to denial because **denial activates
forces that empower hardliners**]{.underline}. [Accommodation holds out
the possibility of empowering moderates and facilitating China's
integration within a reformed version of the liberal international
order]{.underline} that has served its economic interests well. Another
advantage is that accommodation/ retrenchment is cheaper than any
approach involving containment. Retrenchment would reduce American
military expenditures while simultaneously creating incentives for other
regional powers to bear a greater share of their defense burdens. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could return to an offshore
balancing posture, which would allow it to redeploy to the region only
if China tried]{.underline} to overthrow the new version of the status
quo order by, say [launching a war]{.underline} in East Asia. But [by
not signaling status denial, Washington would short circuit one of the
**major causes of radical revisionist challenges in
history**]{.underline}, [thereby reducing the likelihood that active
onshore balancing would be necessary]{.underline}.
